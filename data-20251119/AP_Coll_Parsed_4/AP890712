the 13 black roman catholic bishops of the 
united states on wednesday urged a black priest suspended for 
establishing an unsanctioned africanamerican catholic congregation 
to abandon his efforts and return to the church 
we sincerely hope that they are not commingling personal 
disappointment individually felt frustrations and personal anger 
under the banner of racism the bishops said in a statement 
racism is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish 
concerns 
earlier this month the rev george a stallings 41 established 
the independent imani temple saying the catholic church had failed 
to embrace the culture history and spirit of its black parishoners 
stallings also said that he and cardinal james a hickey failed 
to agree on stallings future assignment in the archdiocese of 
washington 
in the statement the bishops admitted that racism exists in the 
church but said the problem must be solved by dialogue between the 
black community and the church leaders 
if they claim such action is the result of their personal and 
perhaps even shared frustration that racism has not yet been removed 
from the church the bishops wrote then we urge a prudent and 
patient rededication to the principles of honest cooperation and 
dialogue 
stallings was quoted in thursday editions of the washington post 
as saying the bishops had opted for office and position over their 
ability to exercise a prophetic voice 
stallings has been forbidden to preach celebrate mass or 
administer any sacraments church officials said 
earlier this week stallings said he would present a 
reconciliation plan to the archiocese of washington but must take 
place on our terms and must affirm our right to religious 
spiritual liturgical and theological selfdetermination 
the rev william lori hickeys spokesman has said repeatedly 
that the church hopes for a reconcilation the cardinal in an 
article for thursdays washington post wrote i believe this 
particular situation has more to do with the problems and 
expectations of one individual than broader questions about the 
adequacy of the chuchs ministry in the black community to 
father stallings i say come home 
the bishops statement was released through the united states 
catholic conference by baltimore auxiliary bishop john ricard 
the other 12 who signed the statement were archbishop eugene 
marino of atlanta bishop joseph howze of biloxi miss and 
auxiliary bishops harold perry of new orleans joseph francis of 
newark nj james lyke of cleveland emerson moore of new york 
moses anderson of detroit wilton gregory of chicago j terry steib 
of st louis carl fisher of los angeles curtis guillory of 
galvestonhouston and leonard olivier of washington

burmas military government has 
reimposed a ban on the issuing of visas to foreign journalists just 
months after relaxing restrictions in force for more than a quarter 
century 
a telexed message received by a bangkokbased journalist from the 
ministry of foreign affairs in rangoon said visas were temporarily 
suspended for journalists because of adverse news reports on burma 
by visiting correspondents 
the text dated july 4 was made available to the associated 
press on tuesday 
due to the fact that some correspondents have given adverse 
reports on the situation in myanmar burma weve temporarily 
suspended issuance of visas to foreign correspondents for the time 
being said a telex from ohn kyaw director general of the 
ministry of foreign affairs in rangoon 
other bangkokbased journalists said they had received similar 
responses to applications for visas from burmas embassy in bangkok 
burma rarely issued visas to foreign journalists after xenophobic 
socialist strongman ne win took power in 1962 
last year many foreign correspondents travelled to burma 
unofficially on tourist visas to cover a national uprising for 
democracy 
burma suspended the issuing of tourist visas shortly before the 
army began to crack down on the mass demonstrations killing 
thousands of people 
but after antigovernment dissent was crushed restrictions on 
press visits were relaxed in an effort to demonstate a new policy of 
openness and to counter persistant allegations of human rights 
abuses 
the restrictions on press visits have resurfaced at a time when 
the pace of political dissent has once again begun to quicken 
opposition groups have defied martial law regulations and staged 
large rallies demanding democratic rights and an end to military 
rule 
aung myint head of the visa section of the bangkok embassy said 
that the embassy was still accepting applications for visas from 
foreign correspondents but he was unable to say whether they would 
be approved 
officials at the ministry of foreign affairs in rangoon were also 
unable to clarify the position regarding visas for journalists 
but one official explained that the military government was 
annoyed that visiting journalists had interviewed opposition leaders 
while ignoring government officials he asked not to be identified 
by name 
a representative of a travel agency in bangkok that regularly 
arranges visits to burma said visas were still being issued to 
businessmen individual tourists and to those travelling in groups 
but all visitors were obliged to arrange a set itinerary with the 
state tourism office she said

eighteenwheelers filled with electronic 
goods and auto parts rumble out of one of the nations busiest 
foreign trade zones and on past highproduction farms 
they roll past shiny aluminum trailer parks for retirees who pump 
millions into the economy past a busy mall and middleclass 
neighborhoods 
welcome to the nations poorest metropolitan area 
the lowest per capita income of the 318 us metropolitan areas 
in 1987 7001 was in mcallenedinburgmission in the lower rio 
grande valley where a boom is taking place amid rural slums where 
thousands live in squalor 
there are other measures of hidalgo countys poverty it has the 
states highest unemployment rate and in march it shut down its 
indigent health care program when it ran out of money halfway 
through the fiscal year 
but local promoters say the gloomy statistics are misleading 
we are a thriving little town said leonel garza president 
of the mcallen board of realtors inc i keep hearing were full of 
poverty i dont know how they figure it 
new industries especially the border plants maquiladoras are 
drawing so many people that housing values are on the rise garzas 
group in a may survey found only three houses available for rent in 
the city 
more than 1 billion in goods a year pass through the foreign 
trade zone which has had to turn away tenants since its warehouses 
filled up last year 
hidalgo county also is the no 1 destination for 80000 winter 
texans retirees who spent about 161 million last year in 
southern texas 
and retail sales in the area grew 226 percent last year faster 
than any other part of the state 
those statistics also mislead said economist j michael patrick 
director of the center for entrepreneurship and economic development 
at pan american university in edinburg just because we see a lot 
of activity in mcallen doesnt mean its being translated to the 
population in a broad sense 
the broader population he refers to is found largely in the rural 
colonias where developers have sold tiny home sites without water 
sewers or paved roads for as little as 100 down a 1986 study for 
the texas water development board found 52000 people in 366 
colonias in hidalgo county population 375000 
this time of year many colonia residents are boarding up their 
houses to travel north to harvest crops continuing a cycle of 
subsistence living 
we have to get away from migrant work so there will be 
stability in the families so our children will have a full school 
year not half a year said carmen anaya who for 39 years has 
lived south of pharr in a colonia known as las milpas 
the majority of colonia residents are us citizens said mrs 
anaya who through valley interfaith a coalition of churches won 
legislative approval this session of a 100 million appropriation 
for colonia water and sewer installations the bill was signed into 
law by gov bill clement 
nobody has sewer service here said herlinda hernandez 65 
who lives with her husband in a cinderblock house in a colonia west 
of mission her daughter and grandchildren live in a plywood home in 
the front of the same small lot on a street paved with caliche clay 
mrs hernandez has running water and a septic tank but fears 
that her grandchildren are exposed to chemicals from the 
cropdusting planes that spray a corn field behind her house 
a neighbor down the street uses an antique wringer washing 
machine while children play in the dusty street 
many colonia residents have outhouses that overflow on rainy 
days even when equipped with septic tanks many yards end up with 
contaminated soil due to poor drainage and lots too small to absorb 
the waste 
that leads to hepatitis intestinal parasites and typhoid said 
sister christine stephens chief organizer for valley interfaith 
they live on top of open sewers a lot of the time 
the working poor who have no health insurance and make too much 
for public health care simply go without resulting in undetected 
cases of diabetes and high blood pressure stephens said 
like most border areas prosperity in hidalgo county is tied to 
the maquiladoras where us products are assembled by mexican 
workers making about 1 an hour the number of maquiladoras in 
reynosa mexico across from mcallen increased from 36 to 51 
between november 1987 and november 1988 and added more than 5000 
new employees according to the mcallen economic development corp 
yet the county in april had texas worst unemployment rate 167 
percent more than double the state average of 7 percent and a 
point higher than the year before according to the texas employment 
commission 
the growing unemployment in the face of an industrial boom is 
primarily due to a high birthrate and an influx of people into 
hidalgo county said david ruelas employment commission labor 
market analyst in mcallen 
to bridge the gap the mcallen economic development corp is 
trying to attract maquiladora suppliers companies that would 
provide highly paid jobs for skilled labor said president mike 
allen 
but many local communities have high school dropout rates of more 
than 50 percent and a shortage of people with industrial experience 
that makes it hard to convince companies they can find people to 
fill skilled positions in plastic injection molding and toolanddie 
operations and most continue to send the supply orders north to 
traditionally industrial parts of the united states

laurence olivier was a complete man of the 
theater who paradoxically scored some of his biggest successes on 
screen 
his career in england spanned all aspects of the stage matinee 
idol classical actor supreme theater director and producer 
but american audiences remember him best for his movie work 
particularly a trio of romantic films wuthering heights 
rebecca and pride and prejudice and a series of 
shakespeare adaptations henry v hamlet and richard 
iii that rank among the best ever done on film 
olivier who died tuesday at 82 was that rare combination a 
superb classical actor and an extraordinary contemporary actor he 
was at home in the plays of shakespeare shaw and chekhov as well as 
in a modern movie thriller like marathon man or a tv miniseries 
like brideshead revisited 
it would be the equivalent of him being the greatest opera 
singer the world has ever known and a great rock star said 
geraldine fitzgerald who appeared with him in wuthering heights 
50 years ago he was great in pop culture and he was great in 
classical culture 
olivier also was an intelligent actor singleminded in his 
intention to give the best performance possible but also inventive 
and original in this thinking 
he was one of those very rare actors there may be three or 
four in a lifetime who were touched by the finger of god said 
hume cronyn who first met olivier in the early 1940s through his 
wife jessica tandy he had enormous talent application looks 
he had it all he knew how to use it all and he was immensely 
daring there was nothing that larry could not do 
cronyn once was considering taking a job as artistic director of 
a theater company but told olivier he was frightened 
if you wont do it you dont deserve to have it olivier 
said 
olivier embraced all types of theater in 1957 he allied himself 
with a wave of british playwrights particularly john osborne he 
scored a huge personal triumph as the seedy hasbeen archie rice in 
osbornes the entertainer appearing in the play in london new 
york and on screen 
if the character was a saint he would find out how to play him 
in a truthful honest way miss fitzgerald said if the 
character was a villain he wouldnt imitate what he thought a 
villain might be like he would play his own villainry he had the 
courage to look into the darker sides of himself and then use them 
to illuminate the character he was playing 
olivier took chances offstage too he became the first director 
of great britains national theater guiding it through its 
formative years and he was enormously generous to other actors 
giving newcomers a chance at the theater he ran 
it feels like the end of an era said jim dale who was hired 
by olivier in the early 1970s to star at the national larry 
depicted everything from actor to producer to theater administrator 
what great moments of instruction and theater this man gave us 
he was sometimes wrong which was delightful cronyn said 
here he was god almighty among actors and he was wrong 
cronyn recalled agreeing to play in molieres the miser 
olivier was disdainful moliere funny as a babys open grave 
boy was he dead wrong we brought down the house cronyn 
said 
to critics who complained about some of the roles olivier took in 
his later years cronyn said you get to be an icon and its 
almost impossible to maintain do you want to work or dont you the 
great roles by great playwrights dont come along too often 
cronyn said he once criticized a job olivier took its 
garbage olivier agreed then why did he take it dear boy 
theyre paying me a fortune 
olivier worked until the end of his life even when he was quite 
sick he would take jobs mostly in television 
however physically frail he was once he got on camera he 
burned like a fire said simon jones who played oliviers son in 
brideshead revisited 
in his maiden speech to the house of lords in 1971 olivier said 
i believe in the theater i believe in it as the first glamorizer 
of thought it restores dramatic dynamics and their relationships to 
life size i believe in anything that will keep our domains not 
wider still and wider but higher still and higher in the expectancy 
and hope of quality and probity 
he could have been talking about his own career

erich honeckers sudden illness has 
provoked speculation about who is next in line for the east german 
communist leadership analysts say whoever succeeds the hardline 
honecker will face powerful pressure to embrace reforms 
honecker 76 was released from a hospital on monday after 
treatment for a gallstone over the weekend the official news agency 
adn said he had left a warsaw pact meeting in romania for treatment 
honecker who supervised the building of the berlin wall became 
party leader in 1971 and under his guidance east germany developed 
the soviet blocs most successful economy 
but honecker has rejected the political and economic reforms 
sweeping across the soviet union poland and hungary 
east germany has expressed deep concern over the swift pace of 
political change in hungary warning that opposition forces are 
trying to oust the communist party from the power 
at the same time however there have been growing street 
protests by east german demonstrators calling for more democracy 
western anaylsts expect an intense power struggle once honecker 
is no longer in control but they are pessimistic any of the current 
likely contenders would launch immediate reforms that would create a 
substantially freer east germany which remains one of the most 
rigidly controlled states in the soviet bloc 
there is no full member of the politburo who understands the 
need for political changes in east germany said eberhard 
schneider an expert on east german affairs at the federal institute 
for eastern and international studies in cologne 
they dont understand it and they dont want to he told the 
associated press on tuesday 
schneider and other observers say its only a matter of time 
before east germany recognizes it must change its ways if only for 
the sake of keeping up with reformist countries like hungary and 
poland that are attracting western investment interest 
the reforming european states in eastern europe will be better 
partners its just easier to cooperate with more open societies 
said peter danylow an east bloc expert at the german foundation for 
the study of foreign policy in bonn thats a point which should be 
clear to east germany 
when honecker is gone the analysts say the prospects of seeing 
reformminded communist party members climb to higher positions of 
power could dramatically improve 
danylow and other experts say its uncertain who would follow 
honecker but point out some major contenders 
the most apparent is egon krenz a 52yearold member of the 
policymaking politburo and secretary for security matters in the 
central committee a powerful position and one held by honecker 
before he took over in 1971 
krenz represented honecker on some official visits that is an 
important symbol of power schneider said 
another prospect is guenter schabowsky 60 who holds the key 
post of communist party chief in berlin 
i dont think anything major would occur under krenz but 
perhaps schabowsky has a little more understanding for what needs to 
be done schneider told the ap 
the masscirculation west german newspaper bild said monday that 
another possible candidate is siegfried lorenz the 59yearold 
party chief in the city of karlmarxstadt 
the politburo has recently stepped up criticism of reformers 
within party ranks 
in one of the sharpest official rebukes in a decade the 
politburo denounced dresdens party leadership as ineffective in 
controlling hostile bourgeois activities a reference to growing 
street protests by human rights activists for more democracy 
the 61yearold dresden party chief hans modrow is believed to 
have a sympathetic view of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms 
schneider said honeckers departure could boost the careers of 
reformminded officials like modrow 
he said there was a crop of younger officials not yet in 
positions of real power who have a keen sense of the need for major 
changes 
there are some very good people who understand the problems 
the party must give these people the chance to get to the top 
schneider said

if youve ever been thrown a curve 
driven up the wall or played the field you can chalk it up to the 
world of sports 
sports metaphors are everywhere they permeate all walks of 
life said robert palmatier a linguistics professor at western 
michigan university in kalamazoo and coauthor of a justreleased 
dictionary of 1700 sports metaphors 
the idea for sports talk a dictionary of sports metaphors 
came to palmatier when he found himself behind the eight ball 
literally during a game of pool in 1981 
that got me thinking about other pool metaphors like being 
on the spot and then i moved to other games he said tuesday 
in a telephone interview 
i was finding them in newspapers magazines the backs of 
cereal boxes and of course by listening to people he said 
before long he had compiled 1700 metaphors that have made their 
way out of the sports arena 
you can trace sports metaphors back to the 5th century bc in 
fact shakespeare used them in some of his plays said coauthor 
harold ray a sports historian and physical education professor at 
western 
theyve always been used because sports are common to all 
cultures ray said they just make communication easier 
ray said he was most intrigued with the term to have a lot of 
moxie 
i always thought of it as having courage when i was growing up 
i never realized it was also the name of a soft drink sold at 
baseball stadiums on the east coast from the late 1800s to the 
1920s ray said 
other sports metaphors are better known 
when someone asked you how you made out in the oldfashioned 
sense youd either say that you struck out or you couldnt get to 
first base or you scored palmatier said 
teenage boys arent the only ones who abuse sports metaphors 
you cant listen to a politician for more than 10 minutes 
without hearing a sports metaphor ray said 
just yesterday we saw president bush playing baseball with 
polish youngsters im sure he used a sports metaphor there 
somewhere if he takes after his predecessor ray said and 
with all that playing horseshoes im sure its just a matter of 
time before we hear about a ringer 
president harry s truman made famous the slogan the buck stops 
here that too has its origin in sports specifically poker 
the term to pass the buck or responsibility came from the 
practice of passing a buck knife to remind a poker player that the 
next turn to deal was his palmatier said 
the sport with the most metaphors is boxing which can be traced 
to classical greece palmatier said baseball comes in second with 
racing horse car and foot in third 
you make a pit stop spin your wheels or maybe you win by a 
nose palmatier offered as examples 
sports writers and spectators take most of the responsibility for 
bringing sports metaphors into our everyday life in at least one 
case the athlete was at fault 
the reason athletes foot doesnt occur only among athletes is 
because one athlete carried it out of the locker room and into his 
home palmatier said 
there are no plans for a sequel but since writing the book 
palmatier has been coming across new sports metaphors almost every 
day 
ill be talking to someone and theyll say something came out 
of left field palmatier said its gotten to the point where i 
cant carry on a conversation with someone without taking out a 
pencil and notepad

the guillotine the lovely invention created by 
a humanitarianminded doctor to make execution swift and painless 
is celebrating its 200th birthday this year in official neglect 
despite hundreds even thousands of bicentennialrelated events 
the guillotine itself is nowhere to be seen although its image 
adorns tshirts boxer shorts and other revolutionary souvenirs 
at least two museums reportedly were asked to put frances two 
remaining guillotines on public display but refused the machines 
which have not been used since president francois mitterrand banned 
capital punishment in 1981 ended up in an empty military 
installation outside paris 
yet if any single object can be called a popular symbol of 
revolutionary france it is the controversial and hated guillotine 
it is telling perhaps that an authentic guillotine dating to 
the revolutionary period was bought at auction last month by a 
german collector for about 42850 the sale attracted little 
attention from the french press 
as bicentennial festivies reach their pinnacle this week 
souvenir shops are overflowing with guillotinerelated gadgets and 
tourists are snapping them up fast 
a gilded model can be had for 58 tshirts and boxer shorts 
emblazoned with its image sell for about 12 tiny earrings of the 
deadly machine are a hot fashion item party favors and even a brand 
of condoms depict the instrument of execution 
better known among frenchmen as la veuve the widow 
the guillotine was the invention of dr josephignace guillotin who 
believed there had to be an alternative to the gruesome painful and 
above all inefficient execution methods used at the time 
strangling decapitation by hatchet and drawing and quartering 
sirs with my method ill chop off your head with a blink of 
an eye and you wont feel a thing guillotin a member of 
frances constituent assembly told his colleagues on dec 1 1789 
but there was only laughter and the project was put aside 
over the next two years another doctor antoine louis made 
improvements on guillotins design and called his invention la 
louisette it was in fact the forerunner of what has become 
known today as the guillotine complete with an oblique blade and a 
slot where the victims head could be immobilized 
revolutionary executioner charleshenri sanson a religious man 
and devout monarchist who unwillingly beheaded king louis xvi and 
marieantoinette welcomed the new invention 
lovely invention provided we dont abuse its convenience he 
said after wielding the blade for the first time on april 25 1792 
unfortunately his warning went unheeded during maximilien 
robespierres 12month reign of terror 3000 heads rolled in paris 
alone by the time revolutionary ardor was spent 18000 people 
including women and children had lost their heads 
despite his initial caution sanson himself set records of speed 
and efficiency decapitating 21 girondins in 38 minutes and 15 
danton loyalists in less than half an hour 
the guillotine like the reign of terror itself has been hotly 
disputed over the years rightist philosopher jeanmarie benoist 
says the carts used to transport victims to the guillotine located 
at what is now called the place de la concorde prefigure modern 
slaughterhouses and concentration camps and announce the advent of 
poltical murder 
absurd rhetoric counters leftist historian jeannoel 
jenneney named by mitterrand to oversee the official bicentennial 
mission 
compared to the appalling suffering of other methods of 
execution the guillotine represented progress for humanity he 
said

on the israellebanon border ap the border with lebanon is 
the most dangerous of israels frontiers the target of more than 50 
infiltration attempts in the past 18 months by palestinian gunmen 
israeli officials are warning with increasing bluntness that they 
are prepared to use whatever force is necessary to protect the farms 
and towns nestled along the 100mile border 
speaking on israels arabic language tv program the governments 
coordinator for lebanon policy suggested israel would not feel 
hampered by us urgings or other restraints 
we strike anywhere we see there is a potential danger for 
subversive action against our northern border we will strike 
without taking into account any unrelated interests said the 
official uri lubrani 
brig gen nehemiya commander of troops in the north suggested 
during a visit to a frontier army base that preemptive strikes 
would keep palestinians from taking the initiative and prevent their 
rebuilding 
if we feel any organization is preparing an operation against 
israel its better to prevent it than wait for them on the 
border he said under army regulations nehemiyas last name and 
the location of the army base could not be used 
recently israeli troops have been moving out of israels 
selfdeclared security zone a two to 12mile strip on the lebanese 
side of the border in one clash three palestinian guerrillas were 
killed 
the strip was originally carved out as a six to 10milewide 
buffer zone in 1985 when israel withdrew the bulk of its 1982 
invading force but current israeli army and un maps show changes 
in the borders of the strip 
northern commander maj gen yossi peled said one aim of the 
raids was to convince residents not to cooperate with groups hostile 
to israel 
israel must deter the residents so they will at least not allow 
forces to act within their villages because they will be the first 
to suffer peled said on israel radio 
in another operation the army and allied south lebanon army 
militiamen supported by tanks and artillery staged a show of force 
in a zone controlled by the iranianbacked hezbollah militia which 
israeli officials say is helping palestinians in attacks on israel 
israels air force has also launched eight air raids in lebanon 
this year most against syrianbacked palestinian groups half 
occurred in the past six weeks including one on the rashadiye 
refugee camp only 10 miles north of the border 
western diplomats fear escalation could lead to rocket 
bombardment from south lebanon or crossborder terror attacks which 
could result in major civilian bloodshed 
that in turn could harden israeli public opinion and stymie 
efforts to arrange negotiations with palestinians especially when 
such efforts appear on the verge of collapse 
the peace process can be easily sabotaged all it would take is 
for a guerrilla to get two katyushas and a donkey to carry them if 
by chance the rockets hit a school that would be it said a 
diplomat with long experience in lebanon who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
since palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat 
renounced terrorism and accepted israel in december his fatah 
guerrillas have not attemped any attacks on israel 
but more radical groups both inside and outside the plo 
framework have mounted raids which appeared aimed in part at 
disrupting the peace efforts 
brig gen nehemiya said that while the frontier with syria was 
potentially the most worrisome the lebanon border is the most 
dangerous border we have now 
the main threat is that palestinian guerrilla groups will cross 
the border and come to the settlements here either to kill or to 
take hostages and negotiate the release of prisoners 
there has been a long history of terror raids prior to israels 
198285 war in lebanon in one of the bloodiest attacks a 
threemember palestinian squad crossed from lebanon and killed 24 
civilians mostly children in maalot in 1974 
i am pleased that in the past three years no civilians have 
been killed but i cant promise it wont happen again said 
nehemiya 
he said about 50 attempts occurred since the start of the 
palestinian uprising in december 1987 only about one in four 
groups reached the electronic fence but none succeeded since a 
palestinian in a hang glider killed eight soldiers in northern 
israeli in november 1987 
according to unofficial count 29 palestinians were killed and 17 
captured in attempted border raids in 1988 and 25 have been killed 
and two wounded so far this year 
sources in south lebanon who demanded anonymity confirmed a 
recent report published in london by janes defense weekly that said 
arafat was building a new palestinian army force in refugee 
camps near the south lebanon city of sidon 
the purpose is to create a cohesive bettertrained force of 
2000 to 3000 fighters who would act more like an army and be loyal 
to arafat now about 7000 to 8000 fighters in the area are 
organized into militias loyal to various palestinian factions 
for sure israel will not let them rebuild said nehemiya

amazon parrot named baby thanks to some amateur detective work 
i was so happy i just cant tell you ms wilson said

i didnt want to talk to anybody just run 
ms wilson said baby whose wings are clipped was stolen july 1 
from her perch outside her santa monica home she told police she 
had seen a man in a red jacket in the area minutes before she 
realized baby was missing 
ms wilson got baby 39 years ago and the two have kept each 
other company since ms wilsons husband died in 1971 
news reports of babys disappearance reached a woman who said she 
was approached by a man trying to sell a parrot matching babys

she thought it was stolen but that she knew a man who did buy it

president bushs stops in poland and now 
hungary present contrasts between this quiet graceful city along 
the fabled danube river and the northern polish port of gdansk with 
its gray dockside cranes poised like dinosaurs on a smoggy skyline 
shops here unlike in poland and other communist european 
countries are well stocked with products and unabashedly western 
commercial interests are much in evidence the gleaming mcdonalds 
in downtown budapest ranks as a trendy watering hole while the 
adidas store offers the same fashions and goods available in new 
york or munich 
budapest is a city of jagged cliffs and spectacular bridges and 
monuments with the danube quietly flowing down the middle when the 
lights come on at night young couples amble along the river giving 
off a feeling of a kind of belle epoque that many americans 
associate with the old world 
the citys grace which persists despite delays in muchneeded 
building restoration is in sharp contrast to the gritty industrial 
feel of gdansk the polish shipbuilding center where bush met with 
solidarity union leader lech walesa on tuesday 
hungarians are proud of their moves toward a freemarket economy 
including a fledgling stock exchange and a wealth of pamphlets and 
other materials trumpeting their progress 
two young budapest men showed off the countrys enterprising 
spirit to good advantage shortly before bush arrived from poland 
without waiting for the necessary permit from city authorities 
laszlo halnai and peter lakos set up a lifesize standup portrait 
of a smiling bush and charged hungarian passersby 200 forints the 
equivalent of 330 for a polaroid snapshot with the countrys 
distinguished guest 
and a local englishlanguage radio station touts the latest in 
investment opportunities a capitalist twist that still seems out 
of place despite the enormous changes sweeping across the soviet 
bloc 
hungary embarked on pioneering economic reforms that gave its 
capital this gloss by the 1970s but then foreign loans were 
increasingly squandered on unprofitable staterun enterprises 
putting a brake on change 
now the ruling communist party is itself the motor for a push 
toward a free market economy and is negotiating with mushrooming 
democratic opposition groups over multiparty elections next year 
like poland hungary is crying out for more capitalist investment 
and on the surface at least seems to be doing a much better job 
than warsaw 
but both nations are weighted down with foreign debts and both 
have been forced to let building renovation take a secondary role to 
providing the necessities of life 
cars and trucks belching fumes from cheap soviet bloc gasoline 
crowd the streets of warsaw gdansk and budapest alike young 
stylishly dressed girls walk arminarm alongside stooped older 
women still attired in drab dresses and fading headscarves 
but while poland lags economically it has a reform rallying 
point in the labor federation solidarity redandwhite banners with 
the ragged solidarity script are as much a part of the polish 
landscape as the boxlike polski fiats 
some constants of soviet bloc life remain in both countries 
in both poland and hungary young couples can wait up to 20 years 
just to jam themselves and their families into small apartments if 
their marriages survive the preceding decades with their parents or 
inlaws in equally cramped quarters

president bushs meetings today with 
hungarys four leaders give him a firsthand glimpse of the political 
merrygoround that is fast changing the face of this nation 
bruno f straub a 75yearold biologist who a year ago became 
hungarys first noncommunist president since 1948 hosted bushs 
official welcoming ceremonies and a state dinner tuesday in 
parliament 
but straub is basically a ceremonial figure so dinner remarks 
came from rezso nyers an economist who was appointed communist 
chairman june 24 when hungarys squabbling ruling party named a 
fourman leadership to try to unite its members 
aside from nyers the fourman leadership includes prime minister 
miklos nemeth the countrys most outspoken communist reformer imre 
pozsgay and party general secretary karoly grosz who was named 
party chief in may 1988 but increasingly faced calls for his ouster 
from more radical reformers 
the decision to name the fourman leadership was a compromise 
between the increasingly powerful advocates of political and 
economic reform and the more orthodox marxists in the ruling partys 
ranks 
each of the four men is seen as fulfilling his own role in trying 
to maintain the unity of the hungarian socialist workers party as 
the ruling communists are formally known here until a party 
congress chooses new leaders in october 
nyers who is 66 is a onetime social democrat who joined 
communist ranks after the communist takeover in 1948 he was a 
ranking party member during the repressions that followed the 
unsuccessful antistalinist revolt of 1956 which was crushed by 
kremlin troops and tanks 
considered the father of hungarys pioneering economic 
reforms in the late 1960s nyers fell from favor when he pushed for 
more reform he was ousted from the partys ruling politburo in 1975 
amid rumors that thenparty leader janos kadar was under pressure 
from moscow to block further changes 
nyers made a stunning east bloc political comeback when kadar was 
ousted as party chief in may 1988 winning back a seat on the 
politburo 
he increasingly sided with pozsgay and other reformers and 
emerged as the new compromise candidate to lead the party in june 
he is seen as a figure who is both a reformer and yet can still 
placate oldtime comrades with whom he has ties stretching back 
decades 
pozsgay shot up in popular esteem last january when he became the 
first public leader to proclaim that the 1956 revolt was a popular 
uprising and not a counterrevolution as it had officially been 
termed for more than 32 years 
a 56yearold communist who had an unspectacular career until 
about three years ago pozsgay has been the most outspoken proponent 
of multiparty democracy and is a member of the party team 
negotiating next years free elections with the opposition groups 
nemeth a frequent tennis partner of us ambassador mark palmer 
speaks for the younger party technocrats whose careers are untouched 
by the wounds of 1956 and the repressions that followed they rose 
in the relative consumer wealth and openness to the outside world 
achieved under kadar in the 1970s and are anxious to right their 
countrys economic woes a 17 billion foreign debt looming 
unemployment and doubledigit inflation 
grosz 58 is still thought to have a strong voice amid party 
bureaucrats of his age 
but he lost much of the goodwill surrounding his rise a year ago 
with a series of contradictory statements on key policy issues such 
as the new standing of imre nagy the executed leader of the 1956 
revolt who was reburied as a martyr and pioneer of reform communism 
last month 
the man most strikingly absent from hungarys political scene 
during bushs visit is the lionfaced kadar who dominated his 
country for 32 years and died last thursday black flags hang from 
every public building in his memory and he will be cremated friday 
with full honors although many of his policies are now being 
revised

one of the minor mysteries of president 
bushs trip to eastern europe is this does he really think 
americans are fond of saying that you shouldnt tell a cow how to 
eat cabbage 
bush suggested to a group of hungarian journalists that the line 
about cows and cabbage is a common saying in the united states the 
journalists in turn sent his words to newspapers here 
now perhaps everybody in hungary is talking about the way 
americans wont tell their cows how to munch cabbage 
this strange business began in the oval office last week when 
bush was discussing his trip with the hungarian reporters bush who 
has praised democratic reforms here was asked if the united states 
would be equally happy if a leftistcommunistsocialist coalition 
was elected 
the president said in part it would be inappropriate for the 
president of the united states to try to finetune for the people of 
hungary how they ought to eat how the cow ought to eat the 
cabbage as we say in the united states 
bush likes offbeat sayings such as describing a person whos a 
phony or a bluffer as all hat and no cattle that term comes 
from his years in texas though not often heard around the white 
house it is arguably understandable 
but the cows and cabbage remark confused even top white house 
aides 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser gave 
a blank stare when asked if he knew what the saying meant 
informed it was something bush had said scowcroft said bushs 
line may not be exactly right but added there is something about 
cows eating cabbage he said hed look into it 
david demarest director of white house communications said 
bushs comment rang a bell im familiar with a saying like that 
but not exactly that saying 
roger porter bushs adviser on domestic and economic policy 
admitted hed never heard such a saying 
and a texan who works in the white house and who will be 
unnamed here said he was familiar with a line that sounds like the 
flip side of what bush said 
once youve explained to someone how something is done the texan 
said you can say i told him how the cow ate the cabbage he 
didnt know why people say that he said they just do 
the final judge of the cow and cabbage caper is john sununu the 
white house chief of staff 
he was asked in a television interview what bush meant by his 
line 
sununus first reaction was to laugh 
thats an old walker point saying he joked referring to the 
bush familys seaside compound in kennebunkport maine 
more seriously sununu offered a 171word explanation containing 
such pithy phrases as the united states not wanting to define the 
final format of the internal structures that other countries 
should adopt 
compared with sununus verbiage bushs words seemed to take on 
new clarity he was saying the united states wasnt going to butt in 
too much 
one other curiosity from this trip the presidents wife 
barbara thinks that polish leader wojciech jaruzelski is a funny 
fellow 
jaruzelski of course is the man who imposed martial law in 1981 
to crush the solidarity union and imprison its leaders lately 
though he has sanctioned democratic reforms that resulted in 
sweeping election victories by solidarity 
even so jaruzelski is generally regarded as colorless and stiff 
mrs bush sat next to him at a luncheon monday 
he was very funny very amusing she recalled 
when president bush suggested that guests shed their coats in the 
warm temperatures jaruzelski told mrs bush he had to sneak away 
and remove his suspenders as well because he didnt want them to 
show 
so when he had to get up to make his speech he said well i 
better be careful that his trousers dont fall ive gotta 
remember i dont have my suspenders on mrs bush related

evening tour of the white house on the weekend of independence day 
1988 and that same weekend spence said we should swap watches

a friendship thing not to do anything for him

the founder of the antiabortion group operation 
rescue which staged huge demonstrations at the democratic national 
convention last summer was arrested on charges stemming from the 
protests

before the christian booksellers association to promote his book 
operation rescue an account of the groups history and mission 
operation rescue spokesman joseph foreman said terry was a 
political prisoner the binghamton nybased group has 
sponsored numerous demonstrations nationwide 
foreman said there were no plans to post the 50000 bond to 
release terry who was charged with one count of being party to a 
crime and three counts of criminal trespass stemming from last 
summers operation rescue demonstrations outside atlanta abortion 
clinics 
the bond was raised when he failed to appear for a court hearing 
on the charges in february another arrest warrant containing the 
same four charges was issued for terry after that hearing 
atlanta lawyer robert fierer said that if terry had had a court 
date and he had been aware of it he or somebody from his office 
would have attended it 
we were totally unaware of that said fierer who no longer 
represents operation rescue but said he has been in touch with terry 
since the arrest 
fierer who represented the group after hundreds of its members 
were arrested at the democrats convention last summer said the 
cases now involve 1500 people and had become a tremendous 
administrative nightmare for us

arrested 
its a possibility in a lot of cities she said we dont

house taxwriters under orders to find an 
extra 53 billion to reduce the deficit are casting an eye toward 
pipe smokers telephone users air travelers and lenders 
those groups would pay more tax under a proposal by rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee but most of the three dozenplus recommendations that he 
presented to the panel tuesday are highly technical changes 
affecting few ordinary taxpayers 
during the budget year that begins oct 1 rostenkowskis plan 
would produce just the amount of new revenue envisioned under a 
deficitreduction agreement between congress and the bush 
administration 
although the plan would require various groups to pay more money 
to the federal government apparently no part of it is a general tax 
increase that would be viewed as conflicting with president bushs 
pledge to oppose any tax increase 
rostenkowski did not ask for a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
as bush has proposed 
there is general agreement that a reduction in that rate which 
affects profits from the sale of stock and other assets would 
actually increase tax collections for a year but rostenkowski has 
been unable to convince a majority of democrats on his committee to 
agree to a tax change that would mainly benefit upperincome 
americans 
the committee meeting behind closed doors is expected to spend 
several days on rostenkowskis proposals and on various taxcut 
suggestions and ways to pay for them 
the provision in rostenkowskis plan affecting the most people 
would extend for one year the 3 percent tax on local and 
longdistance telephone service without congressional action the 
tax would disappear after dec 31 1990 bush wants to make the tax 
permanent 
extending the tax would raise 16 billion in the 1991 fiscal 
year 
similarly present law would cut in half various aviation taxes 
including the 8 percent levy on tickets the tax on aviation fuel 
and the tax on air shipments rostenkowskis proposal would keep the 
taxes at present levels for another year 
the biggest chunk of revenue under rostenkowskis proposal would 
come from repealing a provision that permits banks and other lenders 
to avoid tax on half the interest earned on loans used to finance 
employee stockownership plans the change would raise 13 billion 
in 1990 and 102 billion over five years 
also the deduction allowed employers for certain dividends paid 
on securities held by those plans would be repealed this would 
raise 368 million this year and almost 3 billion over five years 
rostenkowski says the esop provisions are being abused by some 
corporate executives to protect their companies from takeover 
other items in rostenkowskis plan and the money they would raise 
in 1990 include 
boosting to 267 a pound the tax on pipe tobacco now 45 
cents chewing tobacco now 8 cents and snuff now 24 cents the 
new figure is equivalent to the cigarette tax of 16 cents a pack 
105 million 
a tax increase of 3 cents per barrel of domestic crude oil and 
imported oil with the 69 million pulled in earmarked for cleaning 
up oil spills 
withholding income taxes from wages paid any farm worker who 
already is subject to withholding of social security taxes or who 
works for an employer more than 20 days a year 270 million 
repealing what remains of the completedcontract method of 
accounting under which some big defense contractors and 
construction companies avoid tax on a project until it is completed 
171 million 
permitting employers limited use of excess pensionplan assets 
to finance health benefits for retirees 286 million 
requiring that certain types of deferred compensation be subject 
to social security taxes raising 400 million the change would 
result in payment of higher social security benefits to people who 
pay the higher tax in 1990 those benefits would cost 90 million 
after five years the plan would cost social security more than it 
would bring in 
requiring that the federal gasoline tax be collected at an 
earlier point in the distribution chain from the terminal owner 
that would reduce opportunities for tax evasion and raise 117 
million

pickets marched in front of district attorney 
harry connicks office tuesday and the american civil liberties 
union promised to fight connicks efforts to revive louisianas ban 
on abortions 
louisiana is a major battleground said shirley pedler 
director of the louisiana aclu chapter it is the first state to 
try to criminalize abortion even without grounds to do so public 
officials dont seem to be under the law 
pedler spoke to reporters during a news conference at a new 
orleans abortion clinic 
earlier tuesday a halfdozen members of a new orleans chapter of 
the national organization for women marched in front of connicks 
office to protest his plans 
among the pickets was a 10yearold girl wielding a large placard 
reading harry you oppressor 
connick on monday asked a federal district judge to lift a 1976 
injunction against enforcement of a law making performing an 
abortion a criminal offense 
under the law a woman who undergoes an abortion is not liable 
for punishment only the person who performs the procedure 
judge martin feldman will hold a hearing on the matter aug 9 
connick said he had no plans to try to immediately enforce the 
law 
the supreme courts july 3 decision upholding missouri 
restrictions on abortion prompted connicks action connick said the 
decision leaves open the possibility that further restrictions could 
be ruled legal 
connick said in a broadcast interview tuesday he hoped his 
actions would hasten a decision by the high court to uphold or 
overturn the 1973 roe vs wade case upholding a womans right to 
abortion 
why not find out where we stand instead of waiting for another 
shoe to fall connick said 
pedler said the aclu will argue at the aug 9 hearing that the 
injunction barring enforcement of louisianas law should not be 
lifted as long as roe vs wade is intact

gay rights legislation was passed tuesday in the 
massachusetts senate and advocates of homosexual rights said they 
expect a tough fight when it comes up for final reading this fall 
the legislation approved 2415 would ban discrimination against 
gays and lesbians in housing credit employment and public 
accommodations 
this is the big vote weve been pushing for said david 
lafontaine of the coalition for lesbian and gay civil rights this 
is an overwhelming mandate from the senate 
the bill still needs final senate approval and is expected to 
come up for a vote this fall it was passed by the house in march 
the vote came with almost no debate the chamber rejected three 
amendments proposed by state sen edward kirby that would have 
weakened the bill or included antigay language 
were only halfway there said state sen michael barrett 
the bills senate sponsor i anticipate a very tough fight in the 
fall 
this year as in past sessions the legislation was stalled by 
procedural tactics employed by its opponents kirby kept the 
legislation off the senate floor for weeks by proposing amendments 
then invoking a rule that requires at least a days delay to allow 
the amendment to be printed on the senate calendar 
but this week senate president william bulger who has not been 
viewed as a supporter of the gay rights bill pushed through a rules 
suspension that prevented opponents from gaining timeconsuming 
delays 
he deserves some credit for rising above his personal feelings 
on this lafontaine said 
tuesdays vote sent the legislation to the senate committee on 
bills in third reading a way station for legislation before final 
debate in 1987 committee rules were used to tie up the gay rights 
bill in committee until the session expired 
this year committee chairman william q maclean said he would 
refrain from using procedural moves to block the bill even though 
he voted against it 
maclean said 1989 may be the year the bill becomes law based 
on the head count you have to say it looks like there is a strong 
possibility of it

a cast change moved the kirov ballets altynai 
asylmuratova from the monday to the tuesday the sleeping beauty 
and the scramble was on for tuesday tickets miss asylmuratova is 
indeed a glowing princess aurora 
shes a lyrical dancer whose dancing spins a long lovely 
phrase she doesnt dance fast her balance is good princess 
aurora constantly is being asked to balance but it isnt rock 
solid 
she looks like a human being capable of a catchable waver 
the famous rose adagio ends with each of four suitors taking 
the princess hand and turning her in a circle on tuesday at the 
metropolitan opera miss asylmuratova realized either that she 
didnt have time or didnt have balance she didnt turn for the 
final suitor and he catching on fast dipped her into a position 
that looked like an appropriate ending 
she smiled dazzlingly at the prince in the last act wedding 
scene but earlier while being courted by the four suitors she 
presented a ballerina instead of a girl on her 16th birthday 
konstantin zaklinsky merits high praise for technique and 
deportment as the prince 
lyubov kunakova as the lilac fairy is a strong dancer not at all 
ethereal but since shes primarily the person in charge its 
appropriate the lilac fairy not only makes the princess sleep 
instead of die from the evil fairys curse and guides the prince to 
her palace but apparently she performs the wedding 
the corps de ballet looked wonderful its a beautiful 
production with attractive costumes and oldmasterstyle painted 
backdrops giving an illusion of deep distance 
the character dances at the wedding celebration dont include a 
troupe of russians in this russian version albert mirzoyan as 
pussinboots had some amusing gestures flexing his paws at the tall 
white cat elvira krylova 
andrei garbuz and yelena pankova were deft and fast in the 
bluebird pas de deux yet failed to excite maybe it was because 
orchestral tempos as conducted by dzhemal dalgat kept fluctuating 
thus far in the engagement the kirov ballet has been slightly 
disappointing this may be the fault of a viewer from an inflated 
memory of what one saw on its last visit 25 years ago or from an 
unreasonable desire to have each evening of ballet top the last one 
the sleeping beauty with choreography by petipa and music by 
tchaikovsky had its premiere in st petersburg in 1890

financier sir james goldsmith and fellow bidders 
will have to raise their recordbreaking 21 billion securities 
offer for bat industries plc and throw in some cash to succeed in 
the hostile takeover attempt for the giant conglomerate analysts 
say 
the highly leveraged offer announced tuesday might be a move by 
the bidders to beat the bushes for backers and for competing 
bidders for the company whose us holdings include the saks fifth 
avenue stores and brown and williamson tobacco corp one analyst 
said 
bats cigarette brands include benson and hedges kent and kool 
the acquisition would be the largest ever in europe and the 
secondbiggest worldwide eclipsed only by the 25 billion takeover 
of rjr nabisco inc by the new york investment firm kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co which was completed earlier this year 
the investment group hoylake investments plc offered 850 pence 
the equivalent of 1386 in debt instruments for each share of bat 
britains thirdlargest company 
hoylake which owns about 125 percent of the bats stock said 
it intends to break up londonbased bat which has interests in 
tobacco financial services retailing and paper 
hoylake also includes australian entrepreneur kerry packer and 
british investor jacob rothschild a member of the famous banking 
family 
bat the worlds biggest tobacco company said it would fight the 
bid which it called an illconceived attempt at destructive 
financial engineering 
this is just the opening shot said mike simmonds head of 
british research at yamaichi international ltd 
charles pick an analyst with nomura research institute said 
the offer in its present form hasnt got a hope of winning 
bruce davidson an analyst with smith new court plc said my 
guess is that it has been launched to see if anyone else is going to 
compete or possibly to line up a cash alternative by feeling out 
fund managers 
bat shares finished well above the offered price tuesday on 
londons stock exchange indicating that the market was expecting a 
higher bid to emerge 
bat has diversified away from tobacco in recent years to reduce 
its exposure to that sluggish business 
goldsmith said that by selling bats nontobacco businesses he 
intended to unlock shareholder value among the nontobacco 
units he would sell is farmers insurance group inc of los angeles 
which bat acquired for 52 billion in cash last year after a long 
takeover fight 
bats other subsidiaries include britishamerican tobacco co 
ltd batus inc marshall field and co argos distributors 
appleton papers inc wiggins teape group jb ivey and co and 
eagle star holdings plc

the antigovernment opposition papers 
crammed atop a tiny downtown cafe table symbolize a world of change 
for a resistance movement trying to oust the communists from power 
with president bush in town today nine opposition groups have 
set up shop in the corner of the spartacus cafe 
in contrast to other soviet bloc nations hungary has been 
relatively tolerant of dissidents but such an open and public 
display of resistance such as the one in the cafe would have been 
unthinkable in hungary just a few years ago 
a year ago we could have imagined being taken into custody 
says tibor vidos a labor union spokesman 
vidos says the nine opposition groups represent between 80000 
and 100000 people mapping strategy for free elections planned for 
next year 
i hope the bush visit will strengthen democratic rights the 
35yearold vidos says it will show those in power the world is 
watching whats happening in hungary 
vidos is the spokesman for the democratic trade union of 
scientific workers which bills itself as the first free union to 
be formed in hungary 
he and representatives of the other political opposition groups 
are openly chatting with foreign journalists in the spartacus cafe 
named for a roman gladiator who led a dramatic slaves revolt in 72 
bc the cafe is located two blocks from the us embassy 
on the sultry eve of bushs arrival the late roy orbisons 
classic song pretty woman is blaring from the cafes soupedup 
sound system soft drink bottles perch precariously on the cafe 
table jammed with opposition literature espousing the heady goals of 
breaking the last of the communist party grip on the country 
we have no doubt that the vast majority of people have had 
enough of this regime says geza jeszenszky of the hungarian 
democratic forum 
jeszenszky 47 describing his group as a patriotic movement 
aimed at reaching out to the poor and those in rural areas says 
such an information center would not have been possible a year ago 
on the surface they the communists really have changed their 
spots the hungarian democratic forum spokesman says adding he 
hopes the changed attitudes also go much deeper 
aiding the opposition force is the reform mood within the 
communist party itself as well as the occasional divisions that 
also are weakening the once ironsolid party grip on hungary 
the blunt tone of the material handed out at the opposition 
information center pushes freedom of expression to new limits in 
hungary 
hdf hungarian democratic forum aims at relieving people from 
the remnants of stalinist tyranny and letting the rebirth of the 
nation happen without disaster says the forums englishlanguage 
pamphlet 
the federation of young democrats pamphlet also in english 
condemns dictatorial totalitarian regimes which are also hotbeds 
of national oppression 
federation spokesman miklos sukosd says opposition leaders are 
counting on the proximity to the us embassy for symbolic 
support 
sukosd 28 who said he was a graduate student in sociology at 
harvard university says the opposition groups would like to delay 
the elections by a few months to give them more time to campaign 
the communist party popularity is falling very fast said 
sukosd who like the other opposition representatives spoke to the 
associated press at the spartacus cafe

if all countries removed farm subsidies and 
opted for free trade the american wheat farmer would eventually 
come out on top according to agriculture department researchers 
but there are some catches it also would depend on production 
costs and relative prices domestically and overseas and some wheat 
farmers could go broke meaning the survivors would be fewer and 
larger 
if us acreage programs were phased out including the 
longrange conservation reserve program wheat production would 
rise somewhat in the short run a report by the departments 
economic research service said 
but if a large portion of cropland reentered production 
average us wheat yields would fall because the land currently 
idled is less productive the report said 
if government support to agriculture is completely removed us 
farm prices and incomes may fall somewhat and become more 
variable in the short run 
this likely would cause land prices to fall the report said 
but a rise in export demand over the long run or government 
assistance not tied to production may offset land value declines 
and result in more stable incomes 
the report published in the july issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine is the first of a series by the agency about efforts to 
liberalize world agricultural trade the first analysis deals only 
with wheat 
an editors note said that while theorists claim that free trade 
benefits society there are adjustment costs and gainers and 
losers and because there never has been free trade in 
agriculture the findings are speculative it said 
several studies indicate that world prices could rise 
considerably in the long run and that the distribution of 
production and consumption across countries would change 
significantlythe report said however total world trade in 
wheat is unlikely to change substantially researchers generally 
agree 
an overhaul of global trade and farm policies is being discussed 
by the united states and other countries under the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade one of the us goals in the socalled uruguay 
round of talks is longrange reform including the gradual 
elimination of all tradedistorting subsidies and other programs 
negotiators in april agreed on a framework for both long and 
shortterm reforms the shortterm measures include freezing support 
and production levels followed by unspecified reduction in 1990 
longterm measures call for substantial progressive reductions 
in farm supports including all measures directly or indirectly 
related to trade access internal supports and export competition 
the united states probably has a longterm comparative 
advantage in wheat production because of its climate soil fertility 
and welldeveloped production and distribution system the report 
said trade reform likely would enhance the longterm us 
position since the most efficient producers would gain the most 
from substantial trade reform 
but agency analysts said not all us wheat farmers would benefit 
from trade liberalization if all government supports were removed 
even so producers would have several choices 
farmers could find that using wheat land for cattle grazing or 
other farming operations would earn an acceptable return the 
report said they could subsidize wheat production with other 
income hoping that their wheat production would become more 
profitable over time or they could leave farming 
in the absence of federal income supports farmers with heavy 
debt loads would be in trouble 
the us wheat sector likely would become increasingly 
concentrated the report said over time the costs of 
production may fall as farmers spread the fixed costs of machinery 
and equipment over a larger number of acres while using management 
and labor more efficiently

appropriate in light of the significant issues that lt col north 
intends to raise on appeal his lawyers concluded 
prosecutors said they wont oppose a delay of the fine during the 
appeal 
gesell who could have sentenced north to 10 years in prison and 
750000 in fines decided not to order any prison time for the 
former national security council aide the judge said time behind 
bars would only harden your misconceptions about public service

of congress altering and destroying classified national security 
council documents and accepting an illegal gratuity he was 
acquitted on nine other charges

federal officials may not be paying enough 
attention to the risk of geologic faults and volcanic activity near 
a proposed nevada site for a highlevel nuclear waste dump a 
nuclear regulatory commission member says 
the nrc also said tuesday the energy departments formula for 
evaluating the desert site is flawed in at least two important ways 
kenneth rogers a member of the commission questioned whether 
the department was giving enough attention to killer issues that 
could disqualify the site such as whether geologic faults or 
volcanic activity in the area could destabilize the underground 
repository 
i wonder whether thats getting as much attention as it 
should rogers said 
the commission on tuesday published key parts of its review of 
the energy department plan for assessing whether yucca mountain 
about 100 miles northwest of las vegas could safely store tons of 
radioactive nuclear waste for 10000 years 
the final nrc assessment is to be published july 28 
the nevada state government is strongly opposed to the waste dump 
for safety and public health reasons gov bob miller recently 
signed a bill passed by the legislature prohibiting storage of 
highlevel radioactive waste in nevada 
technical experts who conducted the nrc review told the 
commission the energy department has made many improvements in its 
plan since last year but that it has not yet resolved at least two 
significant issues 
the objections are that the departments plan does not include an 
adequate means of assuring the quality of the technical data 
collected and that the design of an experimental shaft to be 
drilled on the site may be flawed said robert bernero director of 
the nrcs office of nuclear materials safety and safeguards 
bernero said the department could go ahead with its site 
assessment without nrc approval of the plan but it could face the 
same objections later when it sought licenses from the commission to 
operate the dump he said 
initial construction work is scheduled for november and the 
energy department is to decide by 1994 whether the site is suitable 
it would then have to apply to the nrc for an operating license 
under the present timetable nuclear waste would start moving into 
the site in 2003 
dade moeller chairman of an nrc advisory committee that also has 
reviewed the energy department plan said department officials told 
him they believed any problems that could disqualify the site would 
just pop out during the site evaluation 
bernero also said the nrc is concerned that the project timetable 
is putting the energy department under too much deadline pressure 
bernero also disclosed that samuel rousso the head of the 
departments waste management program complained in a june 28 
letter that the nrc was nitpicking on the yucca mountain project and 
causing unnecessary delays 
we are frequently devoting time to repeatedly addressing 
matters that could be more productively evaluated by beginning the 
onsite evaluation work roussos letter said a copy of the letter 
was made available by the nrc 
in a related development the energy departments field office in 
las vegas said it ordered sandia national laboratories a major 
contractor on the yucca mountain project to stop work monday until 
it corrects a technical flaw in its qualitycontrol program 
derek scammell a department spokesman in las vegas said sandia 
is expected to fix the problem by aug 4 and that the work stoppage 
will not affect the overall schedule for completing the assessment 
of the mountain site

women in the third world need special health 
care that goes far beyond the childbearing needs that medical 
providers pay attention to according to an international study 
the womens problems stemming from the large amount of work they 
perform are made worse by the lack of professional health care 
according to the report strengthening women health research 
priorities for women in developing countries 
the study said medical attention for women in the third world is 
focused almost entirely on childbearing 
aw patterson director of the caribbean food and nutrition 
institute in jamaica said that in the third world one of every four 
deaths of young women in some countries one out of every two is 
related to pregnancy and childbirth 
but we dont need the infanthealth rationale for attention to 
be focused on womens health said allan rosenfield dean of the 
school of public health at columbia university 
the women suffer malnutrition diabetes high blood pressure and 
other physical problems far more frequently than women in developed 
nations the report released tuesday said 
womens responsibilities in developing countries include 
obtaining water producing and preparing food and gathering 
firewood all without benefit of modern appliances the report 
said 
women farmers grow at least 50 percent of the worlds food 
womens low earnings poverty and often sole responsibility for 
maintaining households add to the burdens of their dual home and 
market roles because women must work longer hours to earn even a 
minimally acceptable level of income 
heavy work can lead to special leg and back problems the third 
world women are exposed to waterborne diseases because they are 
generally responsible for getting water from communal sources 
women in the third world also suffer from malnutrition due to 
lack of proteins and from anemia and other diseases caused by a lack 
of iron the report said older women have more diabetes and 
possibly more high blood pressure than their counterparts in 
wealthier nations 
the study pointed out that many women in third world countries do 
not know how to get medical attention and often lack the time money 
and transportation to get it 
it called for more research that distinguishes results by gender 
by geographical region and which takes social and cultural facts 
into consideration 
the report was prepared by researchers from the united states 
india jamaica zaire and chile

a study on exposure to agent orange the toxic 
defoliant used in vietnam may have been designed by the government 
to fail a congressman charges 
rep ted weiss dny also said tuesday the decision two years 
ago to cancel the massive study by the centers for disease control 
has wrongfully put the lid on other government research 
the federal government has effectively used the cdc study to 
stifle any attempts to link agent orange to health effects weiss 
said at a hearing of his government operations subcommittee on human 
resources and intergovernmental relations cdc has had the last 
word on agent orange 
either it was a politically rigged operation or it was a 
monumentally bungled operation weiss said 
dr vernon n houk of the cdc said the study was abandoned 
because the cdc couldnt find the right data to develop a valid 
method to study the health effects of the defoliant 
but several other scientists including former cdc researcher dr 
dennis m smith testified that the needed data including detailed 
troop movement were available from the defense departments 
environmental study group 
houk chairman of a scientific panel of the white house agent 
orange working group denied suggestions by weiss that the white 
house called the shots on the study 
the science panel was not considered and is not considered and 
has never functioned as a political entity he said 
weiss said cdc conducted another study finding a low sperm count 
and malformed sperm among vietnam veterans as a result of the 
earlier study cdc dismissed any link between those findings and 
agent orange because we found that few army ground troops were 
heavily exposed to dioxincontaining herbicides weiss said 
quoting the report 
many vietnam veterans have said they have developed cancer and 
that their children have a high incidence of birth defects because 
of agent orange which was used to clear dense jungle during the war 
there are 34000 veterans seeking government benefits as a result 
of disabilities they say were caused by agent orange the active 
ingredient of agent orange is dioxin a cancercausing chemical 
the veterans affairs department formerly the veterans 
administration said in may it would take another look at those 
cases 
veterans exposed to agent orange also have sued the seven 
chemical companies that made the herbicide the suit was settled 
and an agent orange fund was created to pay 180 million in damages 
caretakers for the fund say 12 million has been distributed to 
6039 veterans and 13 organizations so far

senators gathering evidence against judge alcee 
l hastings are weighing testimony from a shadowy figure with 
underworld ties who answered questions behind closed doors and then 
vanished out a rear exit 
he is an elusive figure who can only be located through the 
fbi rep john bryant dtexas told reporters after informant 
william dredge finished testifying at the hastings impeachment trial 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida history is 
accused of conspiracy to obtain a 150000 bribe lying about it to 
a jury that acquitted him in 1983 and improper disclosure of wiretap 
information 
impeached by the house a year ago hastings is now on trial in 
the senate if convicted he would be removed from the bench and 
deprived of his 89500 annual judicial salary 
testimony from dredge at a panel hearing evidence on the case 
came as hastings lost a battle tuesday to get a supreme court order 
halting the proceedings 
justice byron r white without comment denied the request to 
halt the proceedings while the us court of appeals makes a 
decision on hastings claims that the impeachment trial is 
unconstitutional 
bryant and other house members are serving as prosecutors as the 
senate panel collects evidence which will be presented to the full 
senate before it votes on hastings ouster 
police guarded hearing room doors and a television cameras were 
ordered off as dredge was brought in to testify bryant said he 
feared for his life because he had been a witness for the government 
in a trial involving top organized crime hoodlums 
bryant who is acting as chief prosecutor in the hastings case 
acknowledged dredge was less than an ideal witness 
everyone involved in this knew that dredge had a lengthy 
criminal record spanning his entire adult life bryant said 
afterward he said efforts to remove hastings from the bench do not 
hinge on the dredges credibility and that the key points are 
corroborated by other witnesses 
hastings attorney terence anderson discounted the testimony 
saying he had zeroed in on dredges background 
on cross examination i think i showed up the slippery little 
worm anderson boasted after dredge had been escorted out a rear 
exit 
bryant said dredges testimony was intended to show the senators 
there was nothing unusual in building the hastings case 
prosecutors say dredge was sent by washington attorney william 
borders to solicit a 150000 bribe in exchange for hastings 
keeping two brothers frank and thomas romano out of prison 
the romano brothers both now dead had been sentenced by 
hastings to three years each following a racketeering conviction 
involving a loan from a teamsters union pension fund 
dredge facing trial on charges of plotting to distribute 
quaalude tablets became an informant against borders who 
eventually went to prison 
dredge retold the story in detail in his five hours before the 
committee attorneys and lawmakers said 
during a lunchtime break hastings told reporters outside the 
hearing room that dredge was an incredible liar 
quite frankly i dont like him hastings said never did 
never will he said dredges testimony has been carefully 
rehearsed and gone over repeatedly 
meanwhile house members were blocked from asking miami criminal 
lawyer neal sonnett about a telephone conversation between the 
romano brothers and an associate phillip moscato in which they 
allegedly discussed whether someone could intervene in the romanos 
legal troubles 
the senate panels chairman sen jeff bingaman dnm said 
sonnetts testimony would be hearsay

former sen chic hecht is headed to the 
bahamas winning confirmation as us ambassador despite complaints 
from some of his former colleagues that hes unfit to serve as point 
man in the war on drugs 
the senate voted 7819 on tuesday to confirm the nevada 
republican and keep alive the tradition that the senate rarely 
rejects a former member seeking confirmation to an executive branch 
post 
the vote came after hechts defenders declared he was fully 
qualified by his experience in business banking and government to 
handle an ambassadorship 
but hechts detractors pointed to his remarks that he was looking 
forward to his appointment because the bahamas offered gambling 
casinos good golf and fishing 
an appointment of an ambassador is not a vacation trip said 
sen john breaux dla 
sen bob graham dfla who led the fight against the 
nomination said that while hecht might serve with distinction in 
other posts he is not qualified to serve as a key operational 
officer in the war against drugs 
he does not deserve nor does our nation deserve to be 
represented by him in the bahamas graham said 
graham said the bahamas has risen to a high state of importance 
in the drug war because of its history as a shipping point for 
cocaine and other narcotics and because its banks have been used to 
launder illicit drug profits 
sen paul sarbanes dmd said hecht is representative of the 
high percentage of republican stalwarts and fundraisers being named 
by president bush to diplomatic posts 
the chief qualification of most of them is loyalty to bush said 
sarbanes who called them political throwaways 
graham and other senators said the bahamas had become too 
important in the war against drugs to entrust the post to anyone who 
is less than a fully competent and professional ambassador 
hecht 60 whose one term in the senate was marked by such 
malapropisms as his vow not to permit a nuclear suppository to 
be located in his state had told the senate foreign relations 
committee he would feel at home in the bahamas because of its 
similarities to las vegas 
ive been involved in gambling in nevada and ive been 
involved in banking for 25 years hecht said also i understand 
it is a nice lifestyle i love golf and they have a lot of nice golf 
courses and good fishing 
sen harry reid dnev said hecht made those comments in jest 
another defender sen jesse helms rnc said hecht was trying 
to say that both the bahamas and las vegas have multimilliondollar 
tourist industries of great importance to their economies 
it is not something to be twisted and misrepresented and 
heehawed by journalistic pygmies in the news media helms said 
contending that hecht has been attacked only because of his record 
as a conservative 
chic is a remarkable man helms said he is probably the 
brightest man to serve in the senate

a projected surplus in the catastrophic health 
plans trust fund may not be there after all threatening hopes that 
a controversial surtax that would help finance the medicare 
expansion could be cut without touching benefits 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said tuesday he was told by 
congressional budget office analysts that a catastrophic trust fund 
surplus once estimated at 2 billion to 4 billion apparently will 
not be realized 
bentsen the major senate architect of the program that started 
taking effect last january said last month he planned to propose a 
substantial cut in the surtax or socalled supplemental premium 
imposed on elderly americans in upper income brackets 
but that intention was based on projections that more money was 
coming in from the surtax than originally calculated and that the 
tax could be cut without trimming benefits 
im having trouble finding numbers i can count on bentsen 
chairman of the senate finance committee said during a hearing on 
ways to revise the program 
if there is no surplus benefits would have to be cut if the 
surtax is cut said bentsen we have to take a serious look at 
benefits and prescription drugs is one of those we will look at 
he said 
the provision to have medicare payments for prescription drugs 
would be phased in over three years and would be partly paid for by 
the surtax 
when the catastrophic program was passed last summer the first 
major expansion of medicare in its twodecade history the idea was 
to build up funds in advance for the new benefits so the program 
would operate on a payasyougo basis 
the surtax this year is 15 percent of underlying tax liability 
and can range up to 800 for roughly 5 percent of the 33 million 
people eligible for medicare 
however about 60 percent of those eligible for medicare would 
not be subject to the surtax because of their low incomes 
congress has been hit with thousands of letters from elderly 
people complaining they are being forced to pay for additional 
coverage they could better afford to buy on their own 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas a member of the 
finance committee praised bentsens intention to push for changes 
in the program 
some of us would like to hang on to this program but make 
whatever changes are necessary dole said 
the program he said does contain some inequities mainly by 
overlapping coverage that some of the 33 million eligible people 
already had 
because of the complicated interlocking nature of medicare and 
other public and private health plans covering older americans 
witnesses told the panel there is wide misunderstanding of the 
extent of duplicative coverage 
david newhall iii acting assistant defense secretary for health 
affairs testified that although about 720000 military retirees and 
dependents are eligible for treatment in military facilities and 
consider themselves covered by the military program more than half 
receive care in private facilities where the bills are picked up by 
medicare 
we could never come close to handling the total benefit needs 
of this population newhall said

a biologist charged with plagiarism in an 
investigation by the national institutes of health is prepared to 
appeal a ruling that took away his right to do governmentfinanced 
research 
c david bridges now on the faculty of purdue university said 
tuesday he was completely innocent of nih charges that he took 
information from unpublished research by a group of harvard 
scientists and published it under his own name 
a report by an nih committee recommended bridges be barred from 
conducting federallysponsored research and from serving on peer 
review committees 
in addition a spokesman at purdue said bridges will be 
investigated by a faculty committee there although bridges was a 
researcher at baylor college of medicine in houston at the time of 
the questioned publication 
the journal science which published bridges paper in 1987 is 
printing a notification to readers on friday reporting on the 
findings of the nih investigation 
in a statement to the lafayette ind courierjournal bridges 
said im completely innocent of these charges i do want to make 
it quite clear that i did not do this 
he blamed the nih report on political pressure saying we live 
in an ethical era and the nih is under the political gun at this 
point in time 
a report on the nih investigation obtained tuesday by the 
associated press through a freedom of information act request 
charges bridges made unauthorized and uncredited use of information 
from a harvard university manuscript that had been sent to him for 
peer review 
the report recommends bridges be blocked from receiving federal 
grants and excluded from peer review programs for 10 years 
bridges attorney george bishop of houston denied the charges 
and said the researcher will appeal the nih action to the department 
of health and human services bridges also plans to fight to 
maintain his position at purdue 
a purdue spokesman joseph bennett said a committee of faculty 
members has been named to investigate the controversy 
purdue is preceding with the assumption that dr bridges is 
entitled to full due process and that purdue wants to get its 
information firsthand bennett said 
though bridges is a tenured professor at purdue and the incident 
under investigation happened while he was at baylor bennett said 
purdue could take disciplinary action against bridges 
the nih report said bridges committed a form of plagiarism when 
he used harvard experiment data which he saw in the manuscript to 
conduct his own experiments and then published an article in the 
journal science without acknowledging the harvard source 
plagiarism the unauthorized use of another persons 
experimental protocol in this case is a serious misconduct of 
science in that it undermines the entire peerreview process upon 
which the scientific enterprise is dependent the nih 
investigation report said 
an nih committee that reviewed the investigation said it was 
clearly dismayed by bridges behavior and said using 
information obtained from unpublished manuscripts sent for peer 
review is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated by scientists or 
the public 
the report also recommended that all current nih grants to 
bridges be terminated and that the journal science be notified of 
the investigation report 
carol rogers a spokeswoman for the american association for 
advancement of science publisher of science said the association 
also will ask science libraries to crossreference the notification 
in computer files of scientific research 
bishop the houston attorney representing bridges said the nih 
ruling was unfair because bridges was never given a chance to 
confront his accusers or to know precisely the charges 
the charges were reviewed in secret said bishop we think 
if the facts are heard bridges will be vindicated 
bishop said the nih action keeps bridges from making a living and 
could threaten his position at purdue 
those grants are important to keep his livelihood going said 
bishop and loss of the grants probably will have some effect on 
bridges job at purdue 
the lawyer said an nih grant given to bridges already has been 
canceled and that two of his research assistants have been laid off 
according to the nih report bridges was a professor in the 
department of ophthalmology at baylor doing research on the 
biochemistry of vision when he was sent a harvard university 
manuscript to review for a national academy of sciences publication 
in the summer of 1986 
the nih investigation said bridges declined to review the 
manuscript and returned it to the academy 
the harvard research identified and described an enzyme called 
isomerase which plays a role in vision

the commissioner of the food and drug 
administration says he doesnt know whether the government can 
withdraw market approval for products from generic drug companies 
that bribed fda scientists 
commissioner frank e young vowed to seek penalties against the 
firms but told a congressional panel tuesday were having a 
difficult time trying to determine what we can do to remove these 
particular products from the market 
young told the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations he is shocked embarrassed and 
angered by revelations that fda scientists accepted bribes from 
the firms 
subcommittee chairman john d dingell dmich said the scandal 
means we can no longer be reasonably confident that the fda is 
able to detect the entry of unsafe or inefficacious generic drugs in 
the nations pharmacies 
young countered that a special review of the products made by 
companies implicated so far have uncovered no safety concerns 
but he conceded we cannot be fully confident on the issue of 
product safety until more tests are done 
he also outlined new administrative procedures including a 
shakeup of the generic drug division and prohibitions against idle 
contacts between fda officials and manufacturers to head off 
repetition of the case 
the subcommittee has been conducting its own investigation while 
the us attorneys office in baltimore continues to pursue a 
criminal probe in which two fda scientists charles y chang and 
david j brancato have pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from drug 
companies and a third has been charged with doing so 
according to criminal informations filed in the case american 
therapeutics inc par pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical basics 
inc are among companies which sought favored treatment from the 
fda in their bids to market generic drugs 
another firm vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield 
gardens ny is under investigation for allegedly substituting 
samples of an original product dyazide a highbloodpressure drug 
in its bid to win approval of its generic copycat dyazide is made 
by the smithkline beckman corp and is one of the most widely 
prescribed drugs in the country 
we are actively investigating all aspects of this case which 
we regard should the facts be confirmed as wholly unconscionable 
and intolerable in addition we are making every effort to 
determine whether any other firms may have engaged in this 
practice young said 
top executives of vitarine have denied knowledge of the alleged 
substitution and have suspended at least three employees involved 
with the submission it has voluntarily recalled the drug as well 
as several others pending the results of the fda review 
dingell complained the fda has yet to move against the 
companies corrupting the fdas process both par pharmaceuticals and 
american therapeutics inc the two biggest providers of illegal 
gratuities to fda employees named in criminal informations to date 
have each received new generic drug approvals 
carl peck director of the fdas center for drug evaluation 
confirmed he recently approved generic products submitted by both 
firms but said they involved drugs in which none of the 
implicated reviewers had a part and for which applications had 
been pending for 1 years 
dingell said that response shows frivolity prevails at the 
fda

workers in western europe have bargained their way 
to the longest annual paid vacations while americans have the 
shortest vacations and the japanese have to be persuaded to take 
time off an international labor organization report says 
the study published tuesday says legislation and collective 
bargaining have lengthened vacations in europe but there is little 
movement in this direction in the united states 
in west germany nearly twothirds of the workforce get six weeks 
paid leave each year under deals struck by employers and unions 
even though the legal entitlement is only three weeks ten years 
ago nobody in the country had six weeks paid holiday 
in france sweden belgium and luxembourg collective bargaining 
often boosts the statutory fiveweek leave by another week the 
report says 
in legal terms spain has made the most progress increasing paid 
leave from one to five weeks over the last 25 years 
italian workers are frequently given six weeks annual leave 
while most british employees enjoy at least four weeks paid 
vacation even though neither country has laws on holiday rights 
however collective bargaining in the united states has not had 
the same results there are no laws on holiday entitlement and time 
off depends on the length of service with an employer the report 
notes 
it cites a us government survey showing that on average 
employees who had worked for a company for one year got less than 
nine days paid holiday this rose to nearly 23 days after 30 years 
with the same company 
but not many people in the united states stay in the same place 
for 30 years said joseph thurman an expert on working hours at 
the ilo 
he said cultural differences and lack of pressure to increase 
holiday time are among the reasons for the united states lagging 
behind western european countries 
if you told an american that a west german got six weeks 
holiday he would be astounded similarly a west german would be 
amazed that anyone could make do with two weeks paid leave a year 
thurman said in an interview 
although japan cut working hours last year he said the japanese 
are proving reluctant to take advantage of their increased leisure 
time 
thurman said most japanese workers take only half their yearly 
allowance of 10 days leave but the 17 to 18 days of public holidays 
in japan compare favorably with eight days in britain and 
switzerland he added 
thurman noted that japans ministry of labor had set up a special 
leisure development center to persuade people to take their full 
holiday entitlement

a bush administration draft of clean air 
legislation substantially backs off from his promise to 
dramatically accelerate pollution reduction by the year 2000 
say a house panel chairman and an environmental spokesman 
weve got to hope people in the environmental protection agency 
can turn this around rep henry waxman chairman of the house 
energy and commerce environment subcommittee said tuesday after 
seeing the draft language 
the office of management and budget draft also obtained by the 
associated press was dated june 30 and warned at the top of each 
page all provisions subject to change do not distribute quote 
or cite 
a spokesman for the environmental protection agency denied 
tuesday night that the presidents proposals had been significantly 
weakened 
bush and congressional leaders have placed a new clean air bill 
near the top of their legislative agenda for the remainder of this 
year 
bush outlined his proposal june 12 but has not yet sent congress 
the legislation to implement his plan a white house fact sheet 
distributed after the announcement promised the plan will 
dramatically accelerate the pace of pollution reduction and put 
america on the path toward markedly cleaner air by the end of the 
century 
the legislation is expected to be sent to congress in about two 
weeks 
im very disappointed to hear the direction the administration 
seems to be taking said waxman a california democrat 
among the provisions criticized by waxman and others is a 
proposed switch in auto emissions standards from an emissions 
ceiling that each car must meet to a fleetwide average a change 
long advocated by the auto industry 
the draft would give the epa administrator authority to 
demonstrate compliance with emissions standards through intraor 
intermanufacturer averaging of emissions of vehicle or engine 
families 
last month bush said he would propose reducing the exhaust 
standard for unburned fuel from 041 grams per mile to 025 grams 
per mile the limit currently in effect for california 
but to account for manufacturing variations automakers already 
must build cars that average somewhat below 041 grams so it is not 
clear what an average of 025 grams would mean waxman said the 
proposal could mean no reduction in actual emissions 
richard ayres staff attorney for the natural resources defense 
council and chairman of the national clean air coalition the major 
lobbying organization of environmental groups on clean air 
questions said the auto fleet average provisions would be a major 
retreat from current law 
the president said he wanted to require industrial emitters of 
toxic air pollutants to use the best available technology to 
control pollution 
the bill draft however would permit epa to take into account 
not only the risks to public health but also the cost and 
technical feasibility for industry in ordering reductions of 
toxics 
theyre talking about the costbenefit system rather than 
setting a health standard there is the potential to say its not 
worth the cost of emission reductions waxman said no one 
figures the economic cost of cancer and other health care costs 
christian rice spokesman for epa said there isnt any loss 
for bushs proposals 
top epa officials are saying weve won major victories in the 
interagency process rice said he said consideration of cost in 
controlling toxic air pollution was envisioned all along in the 
presidents plan 
the switch to an average auto emissions standard would still mean 
youd get some reduction in emissions he said

a conservationist climbed 71 feet up a white 
pine tree and placed an identification band on an eaglet while the 
new father swooped overhead 
to peter nye who has banded several hundred eagles tuesdays 
job proved mostly routine but it was an exciting moment for new 
hampshire environmentalists in their long attempt to bring 
endangered bald eagles back to the state 
on april 14 they celebrated the discovery of an egg the chick 
hatched about five weeks later but on june 13 it was determined the 
eaglet had died 
thats when the plan was hatched to bring in a foster chick born 
in captivity at a syracuse ny zoo to see if the grieving 
parents would accept a substitute 
three days later the 27dayold chick was put in the nest on the 
magalloway river near umbagog lake on the maine border by days 
end the parents had accepted the chick 
thats when the call went out to nye head of new yorks 
department of environmental conservations endangered species unit 
with biologists and others looking on anxiously from a nearby 
island nye went about his task he called it unusual for the male 
to swoop overhead that close but he was unperturbed 
i didnt pay much attention to him he said i felt pretty 
safe because i had a lot of branches protecting me 
after photographing the chick he took one leg of the eaglet 
which he said tried to hit him with its wings once i got a hold 
of her she was real quiet he said 
he placed a band on each leg to enable environmentalists to study 
the eagles movements coincidentally five years ago nye had banded 
the father who had migrated from new york the farthest nye knows 
one of his birds has traveled to nest 
the eagle is something weve really done a bad deed to he 
said and its good to be part of something to bring them back 
chemical sprays such as ddt crept into the wildlife food chain 
after world war ii and helped make eagles an endangered species 
nyes program has helped restore them in new york maine has 
about 100 pairs alaska has the most eagles some also can be found 
in florida pacific northwest great lakes and chesapeake bay 
we have no control over where they go said carol foss of the 
audubon society of new hampshire we do our best to protect them 
when they come back if all goes well 10 or 15 years from now we 
might have 10 or 15 eagle pairs 
but for now the next step is the first week in august when the 
eaglet is expected to take flight for the first time then she will 
be on her own

take a lump of beef fat spike it with a 
dash of lithium chloride top it off with a whiff of pine sol and 
youve got a sickening recipe 
so sickening that state biologists hope it will keep scavenging 
bears away from juneaus garbage cans 
the state department of fish and game is stuffing fat chunks with 
lithium chloride or thiabendazole which when digested cause 
vomiting and diarrhea the chunks are tied to strips of flannel 
soaked in pine sol a pinescented cleaner and placed along bear 
trails in forests and in garbage cans on the edge of town 
biologists hope the bears will associate the odor of pine sol 
with food that makes them retch if the experiment works deterring 
bears from garbage dining could be as easy as spraying trash cans 
with pine cleaner 
the idea is to make these bears hate being around people the 
faster we can do that the better says state biologist roger 
seavoy he says the chemical deterrents are not permanently harmful 
to the bears 
its too early to determine if the experiment is working but 
seavoy says there are signs that bears sickened by the tainted 
snacks are choosing to dine elsewhere

beef lovers are in luck 
or at least thats what the advertisements might say this small 
western wisconsin community was chosen as the setting for a 
television commercial to promote red meat and the locals have no 
beef with that 
nothing ever happens in little luck said mary peterson an 
employee in the clerks office for the village of about 1000 
residents this is real exciting 
luck was one of four small communities selected by the beef 
industry foundation as part of a real food for real people 
advertising campaign the ads will be a switch from the recent 
campaign featuring celebrities such as actors james garner and 
cybill shepherd and basketball star larry bird 
the whole idea of our campaign is that we want to use real 
people in real cities that have interesting names said jeanne 
sowa advertising vice president for the beef industry council 
the comercials will feature manhattan mont where people are 
supposed to respect good taste utopia texas where they are said 
to feel good after eating beef and yale wash where they 
supposedly are sophisticated enough to appreciate nutrition 
you might have guessed the script for the luck ad where would 
we be without beef a narrator asks out of luck

club goers hoping to party til dawn can come 
a little closer to their goal thanks to a court ruling giving 
discotheque patrons an extra halfhour to imbibe after last call 
in a 61 decision tuesday the state court of appeals ruled that 
new york citys cabaret law requiring such establishments to close 
from 4 am to 8 am conflicted with a state law allowing bar 
patrons to continue to consume alcoholic beverages until 430 am 
while the court noted the law also prohibits the sale of 
alcoholic beverages between 4 am and 8 am it said the law 
permits bars to stay open until 430 am so patrons can finish 
their drinks 
the court ruled in a case brought by the owner of the limelight 
a disco located in a former manhattan church owner peter gatien got 
upset over a 100 fine and pursued his case to the states highest 
court said a lawyer for the popular nightspot 
stuart byron the chief lawyer for gatien said that by having a 
simultaneous closing time and cutoff of drink sales you almost 
compel people to chugalug that could lead to more drunken 
driving he said

this months iranian presidential election 
appears a onehorse race dominated by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani and if the tehran media is anything to go by the result 
is a foregone conclusion 
a poll published tuesday by the radical abrar daily which has 
been critical of rafsanjanis socalled pragmatist faction in the 
past indicated that 86 percent of iranians will vote for him in the 
july 28 balloting 
eleven percent said they would vote for his challenger former 
agriculture minister abbas sheibani of the freedom movement irans 
token opposition party 
three percent said they would not vote in the election given 
special significance because it comes so soon after the june 3 death 
of fundamentalist patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the transition of power has been smooth so far despite fears of 
a struggle between rafsanjanis socalled pragmatists and 
hardliners led by interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
rafsanjani 55 has emerged as the political strongman with his 
ally incumbent president ali khamenei chosen as khomeinis 
successor as religious leader 
the radicals have not challenged rafsanjani in the presidential 
election political analysts believe rafsanjani has so far been able 
to outmaneuver his rivals but that the months ahead could be 
turbulent 
rafsanjani and sheibani a member of the islamic republics 
parliament since it was formed in 1980 were the only two of 80 
presidential hopefuls whose candidacies were approved by the 
12member council of guardians a constitutional watchdog 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia quoted council member hojatoleslam mohammad yazdi as saying 
most were disqualified because they lacked religious commitment and 
sought to run simply to become a sort of celebrity for ambitious 
purposes 
sheibani doesnt stand a snowballs chance in hell said an 
iranian business executive who was in nicosia several days ago 
everyone knows that rafsanjani will win its no contest 
rafsanjani is a formidable political figure who was considered 
the second most powerful figure in iran when khomeini was alive 
he has been speaker of the 270seat majlis or parliament for 
eight years in last years parliamentary elections he polled 13 
million votes the most in th balloting 
sheibani is less well known his freedom movement is led by mehdi 
bazargan the republic first prime minister and barely tolerated 
it is only allowed to function as a token opposition 
sheibanis was allowed to run for cosmetic purposes so that 
rafsajani would not be the only candidate the iraqbased 
mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors who form the main rebel 
movement against the tehran government said in a statement it has 
branded the poll a farce 
a referendum on constitutional reforms will be held the same day 
as the presidential election the fifth since the 1979 islamic 
revolution 
irans estimated 23 million voters are widely expected to endorse 
the proposed reforms these include greatly enhancing the executive 
powers of the presidency in an effort to eliminate competing power 
centers that have paralyzed the decisionmaking process 
that will involve scrapping the post of prime minister currently 
occupied by hardliner hussein musavi 
the new president is also expected to take control of much of 
irans security apparatus thus weakening mohtashemis power 
khameneis second fouryear term expires oct 5 and he is 
forbidden by the constitution from running for a third term 
he is the only iranian president so far to have served a full 
term since the republic was declared after the late shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi was toppled in 1979 
the first president abolhassan banisadr was forced out of 
office by hardliners in june 1981 18 months after his election 
because of his liberal policies he fled to france where he lives 
in exile 
his successor mohammadali rajai a former street vendor turned 
revolutionary was killed in august 1981 37 days after his 
election by a bomb planted by the mujahedeen 
khamenei who was himself severely wounded in a june 1981 
mujahedeen bombing was elected that october amid a systematic 
crackdown by the radicals to eliminate their erstwhile leftist and 
liberal allies 
khamenei won a landslide 95 percent of the 168 million votes 
cast three other candidates polled just 4 percent between them 
despite the current outward appearance of unity with even 
radical diehards publicly endorsing rafsanjanis candidacy some 
cracks have already appeared 
radical parliamentary deputy abdolhamid sharpasand resigned last 
week charging that power was being centralized in a few hands 
a reference to rafsajani and his allies

after pitching his role in the massachusetts 
miracle during his presidential campaign gov michael s dukakis 
is winding down his final term trying to draw from a spending well 
that has all but run dry 
the darkest hour is expected thursday when dukakis will announce 
500 million in deep and painful cuts from a budget just enacted 
personally i regret this he said because thursday is 
going to be a dark day in the history of this commonwealth and it 
is all so unnecessary 
he said the spending vetoes will lead to thousands of state 
employee layoffs acrosstheboard cuts in government and the 
possible elimination of some agencies 
dukakis said he has a constitutional responsibility a 
statutory responsibility and a practical responsibility to make sure 
that over the course of the next 12 months spending does not exceed 
revenue lest we go into the next fiscal year with an even worse 
situation than we face this year 
reductions in state aid to municipalities will mean fewer 
teachers fewer policemen fewer firemen or more rubbish 
essentially those are our choices said lexington mayor paul 
marshall 
weve made serious cuts already said council member buzz 
stapczynski the town manager of wilmington for us to make more 
is going to be the proverbial blood in the street 
since dukakis defeat in novembers presidential election 
massachusetts credit rating has fallen through the floor and a 
major income tax increase has loomed to pay off multimilliondollar 
deficits 
we can either look at this as an ending or as a beginning 
dukakis told his local government advisory council tuesday i 
prefer to look at it as a beginning painful though it is 
dukakis who announced shortly after the election that he would 
not seek a fourth term as governor in 1990 still believes he can 
right the ship of state in the 1 years left in his term 
to do so when massachusetts economic miracle is experiencing 
a comedown from the doubledigit revenue growth of recent years will 
take more taxes he maintains 
but republican house minority leader steven pierce said dukakis 
campaign for higher taxes has failed recent newspaper polls suggest 
widespread opposition by voters he said 
there are times the public can be sold a tax increase pierce 
said but it most definitely has not happened with this one 
because the taxpayers do not believe that spending has been 
restrained or cut or reduced 
in january the democratic governor proposed 604 million in new 
taxes to support a 129 billion fiscal 1990 budget the house took 
a tough nonewtaxes stand and slashed his budget accordingly 
now the legislature is considering a 793 million 18month 
income tax increase just to pay off a 375 million deficit from 
fiscal 1989 and 488 million in recently disclosed medicaid bills 
dating back a decade 
despite the legislatures cuts in his fiscal 1990 budget dukakis 
said he will have to slash 500 million to bring the enacted budget 
in balance with lower revenue estimates and higher projected 
medicaid requirements 
when the legislature acted without a permanent fiscal 1990 tax 
increase we warned them the veto pen would be more like a 
knife dukakis said and thats exactly whats going to happen 
through elimination of 2500 state jobs and other cutbacks in 
recent months the governor said weve been able at least until 
now to maintain basic levels of services thats not going to be 
possible after thursday we are going to have deep and painful 
cuts 
of the 500 million in vetoes 200 million is expected in local 
aid to cities and towns which had already reduced their 
expectations to matching the previous years funding 
dukakis may be able to balance fiscal 1990 with the vetoes but 
the troubles wont end there 
members of his local government advisory council told him they 
are collecting support for a possible 1990 ballot initiative to 
guarantee that towns and cities will receive their fair share of 
state aid in the future 
and a coalition of antitax advocates and chambers of commerce 
also are planning a 1990 ballot proposal to win back the extra money 
that will be going to the temporary income tax increase 
although dukakis has remained steadfast through the mounting 
problems he recently admitted this hasnt been the best seven 
months of my life

government forces killed 
wounded or captured 2834 leftists guerrillas over the past 12 
months up slightly from the previous year the defense minister 
says 
if the figures given tuesday by gen humberto larios in his 
annual report to the legislature are accurate the casualties 
represent about 40 percent of the guerrilla army estimated at 
6000 to 7000 combatants 
furthermore if the generals figures are correct the farabundo 
marti national liberation front has been extremely successful in 
attracting new recruits because its fighting force is not considered 
to have diminished 
the insurgents maintain a constant and active presence in about a 
third of this massachusettssized country 
last year 2766 guerrillas were killed wounded or captured 
according to government figures larios said 455 government soldiers 
were killed in the year prior to june 1 he gave no breakdown of 
guerrilla dead and wounded 
foreign journalists and other independent observers consider both 
army and rebel figures on enemy casualties inflated 
reporters have found that official and insurgent figures rarely 
coincide with the number of bodies discovered following combat 
larios named to his post last month by president alfredo 
cristiani said the six nationwide elections held this decade 
demonstrate rejection of the communist delinquents hypothesis 
that economic political and social problems can only be resolved by 
violence 
cristiani of the rightist republican nationalist alliance took 
office from jose napoleon duarte of the christian democratic party 
on june 1 duarte is terminally ill with cancer and was prevented by 
law from seeking reelection 
the salvadoran military receives 85 million a year in aid from 
the united states more than any armed forces in the western 
hemisphere 
cristiani is trying to form a commission to represent the 
government in talks with rebel representatives nonrightist sectors 
have declined to participate contending the proposed commission 
would not have sufficient authority to negotiate peace 
the rebels have said they will not participate in talks with any 
commission that does not include sectors other than the governing 
party and that does not have authority to negotiate they say 
cristiani is trying to engineer their surrender through the 
proposals for a dialogue 
an estimated 70000 people most of them civilians have been 
killed in the nearly 10year civil war

walmarts invasion of wyoming is being 
heartily endorsed by just about everyone except many jackson 
residents who are aghast at the thought of having the discount 
store as a neighbor 
the department store chain has begun building stores in cheyenne 
laramie and rock springs and plans include adding to the walmart 
stores inc empire in gillette riverton and jackson 
in economically strapped wyoming the six stores mean roughly 800 
jobs and millions of tax dollars 
but in jackson the proposed store is being portrayed as an 
eyesore that doesnt mesh with the resort communitys western motif 
we all know what brings people here said larry hendricks 
the assistant director of the jackson hole chamber of commerce we 
advertise it as the last and the best of the old west there are 
already a lot of chains here but none that in one fell swoop would 
have such a visible impact 
walmart spokeswoman brenda lockhart believes the community can 
only benefit from the outlet obviously we would just like an 
opportunity to be a contributor to the community a good corporate 
citizen she said 
jackson residents are beginning to realize they cant keep 
walmart out of town said hendricks but that doesnt make the 
companys plans any more palatable 
a recent chamber meeting on the issue produced our best 
attended general membership meeting in history he said 
concerns include a fear that housing in the jackson area is 
insufficient to accommodate the 150 or so new jobs walmart would 
create and that walmarts new employees would be coming from other 
businesses said hendricks 
but the biggest concern apparently is that walmart wants to 
build on ranchland south of the western wyoming town of 4500 
residents tourists coming into jackson from the south now see 
haystacks and the tetons before reaching town 
one faction of residents say a rancher should be able to sell his 
land to whomever he wants others believe such a sale would destroy 
part of the very scenic values that draws people here said 
hendricks 
across the state cheyenne leaders went out of their way to help 
walmart plan the 110580squarefoot store being built at the 
capitals north end 
ive heard mostly positive things about it the sort of feeling 
that competition is good for business and that that size of a store 
would tend to draw more people from outlying areas into cheyenne 
chamber of commerce president phil noble said 
when asked about jacksons resistance noble expressed an 
understanding saying the prairie out north cheyenne is certainly 
different than the jackson hole ambience 
den costantino chairman of the sweetwater economic development 
association agreed saying the jackson residents rely on tourists 
and want to maintain the western flavor that surrounds the community 
walmarts drive in wyoming is simply part of its ambitious 
expansion program which aims to open 150 new stores this year the 
company which operates roughly 1300 stores in 25 states has none 
in wyoming 
obviously walmart would like to be in a lot of markets 
lockhart said weve also announced entry into new jersey new 
york and pennsylvania recently 
noble costantino and maureen murphy executive director of the 
laramie chamber of commerce believe walmart will bring new 
customers to their towns 
as for increased competition costantino who owns a mens 
clothing store said it makes everybody healthy

legal observers question a judges order 
that a man with six illegitimate children could have no more 
children except with his wife but doubt the sentence violates the 
mans constitutional rights 
bill mcaninch a professor at the university of south carolina 
law school pointed out on tuesday that state laws prohibit 
fornication and adultery and terms of probation require that all 
state laws be obeyed 
i suppose the condition is not to violate a criminal law i 
guess what hes doing is just singling out one part of the law 
mcaninch a specialist in criminal and constitutional law said 
after the sentence by retired circuit judge frank eppes 
derone suber was in court monday to plead guilty to stealing a 
truck when eppes on special assignment in general sessions court 
turned the sentencing into an impassioned talk about the evils of 
illegitimate children 
suber 26 has six children from several different women he 
fathered his first child when he was 13 
in his lecture eppes focused on the need for people to own up to 
responsibility particularly for the care of children if someone 
chooses to become a parent 
the states got to pay for him and his children said eppes 
this is one of the most tragic things ive seen in court in a long 
time 
at first eppes wanted to make suber visit schools or churches 
twice a month 
but subers attorney w barry bland said his client who walks 
with the aid of a walker because of injuries suffered when he 
crashed the truck he stole from the spartanburg sanitation 
department in 1986 would have difficulty meeting that sentence 
so eppes withdrew that condition and suber was allowed to go 
a few moments later eppes recalled suber 
i dont feel sorry for you im not mad at you im mad at what 
youve done eppes said i feel sorry for those six children 
eppes then sentenced suber to 10 years for stealing the truck 
but suspended it to five years probation one condition of the 
sentence is that suber not have children with anyone but his wife 
during that time 
its unlikely the issue would come to a head unless suber 
violated the terms of his sentence and eppes found out about it and 
decided to enforce the sentence said steven bates executive 
director of the american civil liberties unions south carolina 
affiliate 
i dont know how far judges can go in actually enforcing those 
types of conditions he said its difficult to be too critical 
however because there is a need for a lot of creativity in 
sentencing people just putting people in jail is not going to solve 
problems in the long run 
bland said he may appeal his clients sentence

strikes today paralyzed the national rail network 
the london subway the port of london 41 other british docks and 
local government services across the nation 
the 24hour national rail strike by the national union of 
railwaymen was its fourth wednesday stoppage in as many weeks and 
the daylong strike by london subway drivers is their 10th since 
april 5 
this has been the worst week of labor unrest since prime minister 
margaret thatcher came to power 10 years ago and polls show the 
popularity of her governing conservative party sinking 
on monday and tuesday rail services were badly disrupted by a 
ban on overtime by train drivers belonging to another union the 
associated society of locomotive engineers and firemen 
todays rail strike followed the breakdown tuesday night of 12 
hours of talks between british rail managers and rail unions when 
union representatives walked out 
union leaders said the board that runs the stateowned rail 
network had upped its wage increase offer to 88 percent from 7 
percent the union is demanding 10 percent 
jimmy knapp general secretary of the national union of 
railwaymen accused british rail of being a cheapskate 
railmen also want british rail to cancel its decision to end 
national pay bargaining on oct 31 and replace it with regional 
negotiations that issue was also not resolved in the 
labormanagement talks 
mrs thatcher told parliament tuesday once again it is some of 
the extreme left wing in the trade unions who never think of serving 
the public or of their duty to the public 
a survey of public opinion polls tuesday by the british 
broadcasting corp indicated mrs thatchers conservatives are now 
trailing neil kinnocks opposition labor party in popularity by a 
10point margin 
britains rising annual inflation rate now at 83 percent its 
highest in seven years has eaten into wages leading to pay demands 
and unpopularity for the government 
a national opinion polls survey among 2770 rail passengers 
published today in the conservative london newspaper the daily mail 
said 33 percent blamed poor british rail management for the strikes 
and other disruption twentythree percent blamed the rail unions 
and 20 percent blamed the government 
the transport and general workers union meanwhile said 96 
percent of its 9400 registered dock workers stayed off the job 
monday the first day of their indefinite strike 
the strikers are protesting the governments abolition of 1947 
legislation that replaced daily hiring at 60 ports with guaranteed 
jobs for dock workers they voted 3to1 to strike after port 
employers refused to replace the socalled national labor dock 
scheme with private guarantees 
the national association of port employers said 42 of the 60 
powers were hit by the strike it said the other 18 plus the 102 
nonscheme ports were working normally 
a 48hour pay strike by members of the national and local 
government officers association employed by local councils entered 
its second day today it is the second stoppage called by the union 
in two weeks 
it has shut down local government services ranging from libraries 
and day care centers for the handicapped to garbage collection and 
local tax offices the union said nearly half a million members are 
on strike

president fidel castro has accused the united 
states of withholding information that he says could have helped 
cuba uncover sooner a drug ring operating in the top ranks of its 
military and government 
the official news agency prensa latina monitored in mexico city 
quoted castro as telling cubas council of state the north 
americans had at least two names there was no elaboration 
cuba announced last month that it had uncovered the 
drugsmuggling ring the disclosure followed years of denials by 
castro of us allegations that cuba had become a way station in the 
cocaine and marijuana trade 
the council of state which castro chairs on sunday unanimously 
upheld a courtmartials death sentences for cashiered maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa a war hero convicted of running the ring and three 
alleged close collaborators 
castro said cuba had once warned us officials about a plot to 
assassinate former president reagan and said the courtesy should 
have been repaid with information about the narcotics ring 
prensa latina said cuban intelligence told washington the 
assassination plot involved reactionary elements in the southern 
united states who had planned to kill reagan the next time he 
visited their state 
it did not provide further details 
excerpts of castros sunday speech were broadcast tuesday night 
on cuban television and reported early today by prensa latina 
castro said ochoa and the three others must face a firing squad 
to restore faith in the cuban revolution ensure discipline in the 
armed forces and set an example no date of execution was given 
the 29member council also upheld prison sentences ranging from 
10 to 30 years for 10 other defendants all has been officials in 
the military or the interior ministry security service 
the council was the final court of appeal the news agency said 
castro said he did not try to influence the councils decision 
he said he asked each of its members for their points of view but 
i never said a word about what i thought 
he said the drug scandal had eroded cubas international image 
and crippled the tourism industry it has been trying to foster 
castros comments about the united states were harsh 
he accused washington of trying to discredit his brother and 
heirapparent defense minister raul castro through a propaganda 
campaign officials in washington had suggested that ochoas 
prosecution may have been politically motivated 
the president said he had ordered vice foreign minister ricardo 
alarcon to tell an unnamed us official that the people who are 
spreading these accusations are sons of bitches 
he said that if us intelligence officials had been frank and 
discreet cuba would have taken the drug trafficking charges more 
seriously and been able to expose the drug ring sooner 
it was only after friends of ours in colombia came forward 
with information about cuban involvement in the drug trade that the 
allegations were taken seriously he said 
ochoa and the others were convicted of collaborating with the 
medellin cartel in colombia the worlds largest cocaine ring 
castro said it was supremely grave that a member of the 
central committee a hero of the republic a general of a division 
a man with the prestige ochoa had could become so corrupt 
ochoa fought alongside castro in the revolution that overthrew 
dictator fulgencio batista in 1959 he went on to become a trusted 
aide who carried out confidential missions for the president 
he is one of only five officers ever awarded cubas highest 
medal the hero of the republic ochoa 57 was decorated for his 
service as a field commander in ethiopia and angola he also headed 
the cuban military mission in nicaragua 
castro repeatedly sought to distance himself from the 
nowdiscredited ochoa who is also accused of doing a lucrative 
black market business on the side while in angola that involved 
diamonds ivory rare woods and military supplies 
castro said commuting ochoas sentence could create an impression 
of impunity that might destroy discipline in the armed forces 
ochoa and the others were convicted on friday they had earlier 
been stripped of all rank and honors and given dishonorable 
discharges

firefighters traditionally 
battle wildfires with shovels and bulldozers but those tools are 
too damaging to use on a fire threatening an ancient indian site 
were not going to compromise the archaeology of the area to 
put a bulldozer line in said paul hefner a us bureau of land 
management firefighter assigned to the blaze in southwest colorado 
were very sensitive to that weve got to stop this fire but 
not at that cost he said 
about 400 firefighters and several archaeologists worked to 
contain the blaze tuesday the fire was triggered saturday by a 
lightning strike forcing closure of the popular park that houses 
numerous ancient cliff dwellings occupied in the 13th century by the 
anasazi indians 
the dwellings are in canyons and have not been damaged by fire 
said charles harnish a fire information officer 
san juan national forest archaeologist gary matlock one of seven 
or eight archaeologists who worked with fire crews said the blaze 
also was not damaging ground archaeological sites on the mesas above 
the canyons 
they have been through fires before in the 800 years theyve 
been there he said its moving right over them 
the archaeologists mark the sites so firefighters avoid damaging 
or disrupting them said linda martin district interpreter for the 
chapin mesa district at the park the scientists also are on hand in 
case firefighters run across a significant find 
ordinarily they would just bring in a dozer and clear the 
area but there is too much to be lost here for that she said 
in addition to the cliff dwellings the archaeologists are 
concerned mainly with surface finds such as campsites and kivas 
large rooms used for religious and other purposes 
many surface finds have been burned before in the nearly 800 
years since they were abandoned she said the earlier fires have 
damaged some of the surface material of the finds but under the 
surface there is still a great potential for finding more martin 
said 
one of the things the archaeologists are doing is studying the 
effects of heat on the pottery the heat has already damaged the 
sandstone of the structures it discolors them she said 
firefighter curtis miller said working with the archaeologists 
was no trouble 
we would clear the brush then an archaeologist would come 
through and mark it before we cut the actual hand line he said

photographer charles tasnadi jumped down 
the steps from air force one to the ground and thrust his fists 
upward in triumph he had returned to his native hungary after 38 
years 
if i won 1 million i wouldnt feel better tasnadi said on 
the twohour flight from warsaw poland to budapest peering out 
the window as president bushs plane landed tuesday the associated 
press photographer muttered to himself moment of truth 
but as soon as he hit the ground tasnadi went to work trotting 
across the tarmac in a heavy rain to photograph bushs arrival 
welcome home charlie his colleagues told him 
as he focused his camera on bush his hands shook but the 
emotions of the moment were blunted by his preoccupation with 
getting good pictures 
tasnadi had fled hungarys communist dictatorship as a 
25yearold man crawling to freedom through heavy snow and 
treacherous minefields he returned tuesday as a 64yearold 
naturalized american an ap photographer covering the first visit by 
a us president to tasnadis homeland 
his story was well known to bush and the president summoned the 
photographer to a forward cabin on air force one to offer his 
congratulations during the flight from warsaw 
tasnadi said bush had told him that he was very happy that i 
was here he said it was most fitting and proper that i return this 
way 
the photographers return was a poignant contrast to the way he 
had left 
tasnadi a championship skier and his sweetheart maria now his 
wife joined a group of six other adults and two children in making 
their escape from hungary during the first heavy snowfall of the 
195051 winter 
he concocted a story about heading for the slopes telling the 
truth only to his mother who by design would report him missing 
two days later 
in the freezing cold the group made its way across the border to 
austria on the final nightlong trek across the border tasnadi 
carried one of the young children on his back 
once in austria the escapees took pains to elude soviet guards 
in the 50mile soviet zone of that nation they arrived in salzburg 
several days later 
it was a harrowing trip the other child carried by another man 
had to be knocked unconscious to keep it from crying and alerting 
the guards 
and it was so miserably cold tasnadi said twice i fell 
through the ice up to my chest i couldnt even feel it 
unexpectedly tasnadi said he was not overwhelmed with emotion 
during his coverage of the welcoming ceremony for bush in a downpour 
in lajos kossuth square 
i never covered any presidential act in such a rain outside 
tasnadi said i was so overwhelmed with the work and to cover the 
president that it didnt hit me so deeply as i expected 
the weather messed up the whole arrival ceremony so there were 
no national anthems he said tasnadi had feared he would be 
reduced to tears hearing the music 
i just looked at this place and thought my god this is the 
place where as a small boy i was standing as honor guard with boy 
scouts during civic ceremonies he said 
tasnadi said he was surprised that so many hungarians turned out 
in bad weather to greet bush 
it shows how the hungarian people feel about the united states 
and this president he said this impressed me very deeply

abortion a crime 
louisiana is a major battleground aclu director shirley 
pedler said at a news conference tuesday at a new orleans abortion 
clinic it is the first state to try to criminalize abortion even 
without grounds to do so

crime to perform an abortion 
under the law a woman who undergoes an abortion is not liable 
for punishment only the person who performs the procedure 
judge martin feldman will hold a hearing on the matter aug 9 
connick said the us supreme courts july 3 decision upholding 
missouri restrictions on abortion prompted his action connick said 
the decision leaves open the possibility that more restrictions 
might be deemed legal 
in a broadcast interview tuesday connick said he hoped his 
actions would lead the high court to reconsider the 1973 roe vs 
wade case establishing a womans right to abortion 
why not find out where we stand instead of waiting for another 
shoe to fall connick asked 
pedler called connicks action irresponsible she said the aclu 
will argue at the hearing that the injunction barring enforcement of 
louisianas law should not be lifted as long as roe vs wade is 
intact 
on the small picket line at connicks office michelle gross of 
now said connick was simply playing politics 
mr connick doesnt care anything about women she said he 
doesnt care anything about fetuses he cares about harry connick

district of columbia council members cite 
ethics concerns in voting to cap outside income for top city 
officials but others call it a power play aimed at discouraging 
jesse jackson from running for mayor 
the council on tuesday approved a bill sponsored by mayoral 
hopeful john ray that limits speaking fees and other honoraria to 
10000 a year for the mayor and the 13 council members 
some of us who have been involved in the civil rights movement 
have heard this before said council member frank smith who 
opposed the bill it looks like a cheap shot and we always look 
foolish when it looks like were trying to keep someone from 
running 
jacksons advisers reported tuesday that jackson and his wife 
jackie will move from chicago and establish legal residence in the 
district this month to qualify for any potential mayoral campaign 
the washington post quoted jackson aides as saying the couple 
will temporarily move into an apartment because renovations to the 
house they own here are behind schedule candidates for mayor must 
be legal residents of the district for at least a year before 
election 
jackson whose advisers have said he is strongly considering 
running for mayor in the 1990 election was traveling in egypt and 
could not be reached for comment the twotime democratic 
presidential candidate earns most of his estimated 200000 annual 
income from giving speeches and making appearances 
the measure also would limit annual book royalty income to 
10000 for the mayor and council chairman no limits would be 
imposed on income from other types of employment but the mayor and 
council members would for the first time have to report all sources 
of outside income 
the mayors job pays 82500 per year 
the measure which was passed by a voice vote would take effect 
in september if it is not vetoed by either congress or mayor marion 
barry neither has indicated plans to veto the measure thus far 
smith indicated he thought it ironic that the council which 
includes three members who got their political starts in the civil 
rights movement would enact a bill that might discourage a 
candidate from running for office 
those are the things we fought against said smith they 
used to say if blacks want to be kings and queens they can go 
back to africa thats what were doing here 
ray has said he started considering the bill last year after city 
residents criticized the council for voting itself a pay raise 
however he did not explain why he waited to introduce it until 
rumors of a possible jackson mayoral candidacy surfaced 
ray did not return several phone calls placed by a reporter after 
the council session ended 
i was aware of the jesse jackson ramifications sure i was 
said council chairman david clarke it became a question of 
timing i was damned if i did and damned if i had ignored it 
clarke also a declared mayoral candidate attached to the bill 
the provision limiting income from book royalties 
council member hr crawford scoffed at the need for an income 
limit 
most people i talk to in the community would pay us 10000 
only to be quiet crawford said who on this council could earn 
that much giving speeches 
clarke said its impossible to tell 
i dont know how much anyone here makes clarke said 
thats the point this bill will tell us 
smith said the bill wont prevent jackson from running but could 
cause political embarrassment for ray clarke and the other council 
members if he is elected 
things like this usually turn out to be shortsighted 
mistakes smith said the effect here is fairly obvious

communist party leader jiang zemin today told 
chinese officials they must work harder to counter western 
rumors about the crackdown on prodemocracy protesters last 
month 
premier li peng promised that chinese students abroad who 
participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to china and 
not punished 
li and jiang were speaking at the end of a sixday conference of 
151 ambassadors and other diplomats who were called back to beijing 
to discuss chinese foreign policy in the wake of political turmoil 
at home 
jiang was quoted on the national evening news as telling the 
ambassadors and diplomats they must increase their work in 
explaining the truth to counter rumors of western reports 
jiang said the diplomats must help foreign friends get rid of 
their misunderstandings of chinas suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement 
china says about 300 people including many soldiers were killed 
when the military occupied beijing on june 34 to end seven weeks of 
studentled demonstrations chinese sources and western intelligence 
reports have put the death toll as high as 3000 
the united states and many western nations have suspended 
highlevel contacts with china and frozen talks on new financial 
assistance to china to show their outrage over the use of force 
many western nations are allowing chinese students to extend 
their stays because of fears they face persecution if they return to 
china more than 2000 people have been reported arrested for 
joining protests 
because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the 
western media they didnt understand the true situation and 
participated in protests and said some extremist words li was 
quoted as saying about students living abroad 
he said the party is making a conscientious effort to tackle 
problems such as corruption and unfair job assignments key issues 
during the demonstrations 
jiang said the turmoil showed chinas leaders they must uphold 
socialist principles and combat the trend toward bourgeois 
liberalization or attraction to western culture 
he said china must educate the entire nation particularly its 
young people in patriotism and raise the level of national pride 
chinas concern about outside reaction to events at home was 
expressed when the communist partys official newspaper urged the 
rival government on taiwan not to let the crackdown on dissent stand 
in the way of improving ties 
the appeal in a frontpage commentary in todays peoples daily 
came after chinese police ordered two taiwanese reporters out of the 
country 
hsu lu who in september 1987 was the first taiwanese journalist 
to come to mainland china said before leaving for hong kong that it 
was very ironic the government that had so warmly welcomed her 
was now expelling her 
china on tuesday deported taiwanese reporter huang tehpei after 
holding him for eight days and the peoples daily said china acted 
leniently toward him for the sake of relations with taiwan 
huang a reporter for the independence morning post was accused 
of violating martial law regulations that ban most reporting 
activities he also was accused of contacting a student dissident 
wanted by police 
hsu who works for the independence evening news was accused of 
violating martial law reporting on a tourist visa and trying to 
help a fugitive escape she admitted receiving a call from wang dan 
a leader of the prodemocracy movement 
hsu said she told her interrogators i got wang dans phone 
call and agreed to meet with him but i never even saw him 
her colleague huang kept the appointment on july 2 to discuss 
options for wangs escape but the two split up when they realized 
their car was being followed security agents chased the car 
carrying wang 
huang said in hong kong on tuesday that authorities told him wang 
had been arrested but there has been no announcement 
the peoples daily commentary acknowledged that the suppression 
on the prodemocracy movement had hurt efforts to increase contacts 
with taiwan 
the recent turmoils in some places on the mainland and the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion in beijing plus truthdistorting 
propaganda by some chinese and foreign news media have to some 
extent had a negative impact on such activities it said 
the nationalist government which lost a civil war to the 
communists and fled to taiwan in 1949 still bans official contacts 
with the mainland but in the past two years has eased restrictions 
on nongovernmental ties

a leading newspaper said today 
pope john paul ii is expected to visit several cities in south 
africa early next year 
cardinal owen mccann archbishop emeritus of cape town told the 
star of johannesburg that the most likely date for a papal visit is 
may 1990 
mccann said he discussed the visit when he met with vatican 
officials and the pontiff in rome last week 
the vatican has indicated that the pope is expected to travel to 
africa next year but says it is premature to discuss which countries 
he will visit 
the vatican has strongly condemned the south african racial 
segragation policies of apartheid but the pope has indicated he 
would be willing to visit 
john paul spent several hours in south africa in september when 
his plane was diverted because of bad weather on a flight from 
botswana to lesotho 
he visited five countries that border south africa on that trip 
and repeatedly called for an end to racial discrimination without 
mentioning south africa by name

a japanese beverage maker will stop using a 
trademark portraying a tophatted thicklipped black man sipping a 
drink through a straw because some customers find it racist the 
company announced today 
nobuaki hashimoto spokesman of calpis food industry co said 
the company will discontinue the 65yearold trademark by the end of 
the year the logo appears on labels of the companys topselling 
soft drinks and on advertising billboards across the country 
in an age of internationalization we cannot continue to use 
the trademark if it gives unpleasant feelings to consumers 
hashimoto said 
calpis food industry began reconsidering the use of its logo in 
february because of increased interest in the issue of racial 
discrimination in japan 
in january japanese publishers stopped selling little black 
sambo one of the most popular childrens books in japan because 
of the racist connotations the book carried 
in august japan drew harsh criticism from the us congressional 
black caucus for black mannequins and dolls which caucus members 
said stereotyped and degraded blacks by exaggerating their physical 
features 
japanese department stores subsequently withdrew mannequins and 
black dolls from their display windows and shelves 
japanese politicians also have been denounced for racism 
last summer michio watanabe the policy chief of the governing 
liberal democratic party said american blacks have few qualms about 
going bankrupt and implied they walk away from debts 
two years ago thenprime minister yasuhiro nakasone caused a 
controversy when he said the overall us intelligence rate was 
brought down by the large numbers of blacks mexicans and puerto 
ricans living in the country 
 
both men later apologized for their comments 
hashimoto said that before it decided to discontinue the logo 
the company conducted a survey of 36 americans living in japan and 
more than half of them said they found the logo offensive 
calpis food whose annual sales total 4517 million produces 80 
million bottles of calpis beverages a year the official said

here is the text of president bushs 
speech as delivered wednesday at karl marx university 
mr prime minister and mrs nemeth ladies and gentlemen dr and 
mrs csaki it is a great pleasure for barbara and me to be back in 
budapest and i am very proud to be the first american president to 
visit hungary 
some might find it ironic that i am speaking at a university 
named after karl marx if you dont find it ironic in hungary try 
it on for size in the united states 
but the fact that i am here today is less a cause for surprise 
than proof that america welcomes the unfettered competition of 
ideas and i understand that 50 or so of the faculty from this great 
university have been as either students or teachers in the united 
states of america and that is a very good thing for my country and 
im glad you came our way 
the universitys principal task is to promote a competition an 
unfettered competition of ideas and that is the spirit that brings 
us together a spirit that guided a great teacher at karl marx 
university whose name was imre nagy 
as his funeral proceeded in heroes square a few weeks ago the 
rising voice of hungary was heard reciting the szozat and in this 
simple somber ceremony the world saw something more than a 
dignified act an act of reconciliation we witnessed an act of 
truth 
it is on this foundation of truth more solid than stone that 
hungarians have begun to build a new future a generation waited to 
honor imre nagys courage may a hundred generations remember it 
while hungary rediscovers its natural role in the affairs of 
europe the world again looks to you for inspiration 
a popular nonfiction book in my country today is entitled 
budapest 1900 dr john lukacs lovingly describes the budapest 
of memory with its proud stock exchange and great opera a time 
when europes first electric subway ran underneath the handsome 
shop andrassy avenue a city that rivaled paris in its splendor 
vienna in its music london in its literature a center of learning 
that enlightened the world and gave america one kind of genius in 
joseph pulitzer another in bela bartok 
but for four decades this great city this great nation so 
central to the continent in every respect has been separated from 
europe and the west 
and today hungary is opening again to the west becoming a 
beacon of light in european culture and i see people in motion 
color creativity experimentation i see a new beginning for 
hungary 
the very atmosphere of this city the very atmosphere of 
budapest is electric and alive with optimism your people and your 
leaders government and opposition alike are not afraid to break 
with the past to act in the spirit of truth 
and what better example of this could there be than one simple 
fact karl marx university has dropped das kapital from its required 
reading list 
some historians argue that marxism arose out of a humane impulse 
but karl marx traced only one thread of human existence and missed 
the rest of the tapestry the colorful and varied tapestry of 
humanity he regarded man as hapless unable to shape his 
environment or destiny 
but man is not driven by impersonal economic forces hes not 
simply an object acted upon by mechanical laws of history rather 
man is imaginative and inventive he is artistic with an innate 
need to create and enjoy beauty he is a loving member of a family 
and a loyal patriot to his people man is dynamic determined to 
shape his own future 
the creative genius of the hungarian people long suppressed is 
again flourishing in your schools your businesses your churches 
and this is more than a fleeting season of freedom it is hungary 
returning to its normal traditional values it is hungary returning 
home 
voices long stilled are being heard again an independent daily 
newspaper is now sold on the streets commercial radio and 
television stations will broadcast everything from the news to the 
music of stevie wonder and radio free europe is opening its first 
eastern european bureau right here in budapest 
along your border with austria the ugly symbol of europes 
division and hungarys isolation is coming down as the barbed wire 
fences are rolled and stacked into bales

offensive on kabul and najibs government has warned that it may 
shell pakistan

afghanistan when it withdrew the last of its troops on feb 15 under 
a unmediated accord moscow however has continued to supply 
arms to the kabul government

ronald reagan drove in with his entourage 
put on the headsets checked out the microphone and went back to 
what he does best talking to america 
from san diego street gangs to old movies to the dominican 
republic he had something to say just like every other baseball 
announcer the former president was vin scullys color commentator 
for the first inning of tuesday nights allstar game won by the 
american league 53 
and he seemed to like it 
ive been out of work for six months reagan said maybe 
theres a future here 
after retiring from the world of tip oneill and jim wright 
reagan returned for a night to the realm of harry caray and phil 
rizzuto reagan was his old self a bit of humor and some 
memorized facts 
now i get a little selfconscious when people can see whats 
going on the former radio announcer said while wrapping up his 
25minute stint 
like any good announcer reagan went down to the clubhouse before 
the game to talk to the players unlike any other announcer he 
brought along dozens of secret service people who sealed and 
unsealed corridors trapping even baseball officials while he passed 
through 
al president bobby brown took him through his leagues clubhouse 
bill white was to lead the national league tour but nl manager tommy 
lasorda intervened and did it himself 
reagan had done most of his homework on monday meeting for an 
hour with scully and nbc sports president dick ebersol he took a 
lot of notes ebersol said and was worried about saying the obvious 
it worked he bandied about the statistics of national leaguers 
tony gwynn and kevin mitchell in a way his critics said he was never 
able to do when he talked about the federal budget 
he was tied up with the gangs when he was young in school 
reagan said of mitchell and his brother was killed in a gang 
fight and he started out in them but a remarkable person in his 
family his grandmother took charge and i understand she saw that 
he got a good education now here he is away from the gangs in 
baseball 
at times the 78yearold reagan just talked with scully about 
what it was like to have outlived many of the ballplayers he grew up 
with 
scully we were talking before about how baseball makes you 
feel young and when you come down here i guess all of sudden you 
have to figure a few years have fallen off 
reagan well yes particularly when our host here tonight is 
angels owner gene autry and hes 81 and then california coach 
jimmy reese down there who threw out the first pitch is 83 i feel 
kind of like a kid 
sports broadcasting is nothing new for reagan in the 1930s 
dutch reagan recreated chicago cubs games from western union 
teletype reports on who in des moines iowa 
reagan who played george gipp in knute rockne all american 
also was in a baseball movie once scully got that in while the 
first batter st louis ozzie smith was up 
you wore a cardinal uniform as we look at ozzie scully said 
not here in a stadium reagan said i wore a cardinal 
uniform when i was playing grover cleveland alexander in the 
picture the winning team 
he even got into a little foreign territory when scully mentioned 
that pedro guerrero was from the dominican republic 
they have quite a baseball training ground down there for our 
major leagues reagan said 
its been a long time since reagan followed baseball 
did you get a chance to watch any baseball with all the 
worldly pressures on your shoulders among other things scully 
asked 
not as much as i would have liked reagan said here and 
there but you couldnt quite keep up with what all was going on

theater lights were dimmed and flags lowered as 
britain and the world paid tribute to the incomparable talent of 
laurence olivier 
olivier died in his sleep tuesday at age 82 
queen elizabeth ii and prime minister margaret thatcher joined 
former president reagan in paying their respects to the actor many 
regarded as the greatest of his time 
but as olivier would have wished the shows went on and there was 
virtually unanimous agreement that his legacy would continue in 
playhouses worldwide 
the founding father of britains national theater and twotime 
academy award winner left colleagues reaching for superlatives 
his public pondered the significance of a career embracing 
shakespearean tragedy and chekhovian comedy the romantic and the 
elegiac 
he had more magic on the stage than any actor i have ever seen 
he was extraordinary he was irreplaceable said sir john mills 
one of a generation of distinguished actorknights of those 
olivier sir john gielgud and the late sir ralph richardson were 
considered the three finest 
we became in some ways kind of rivals rather than colleagues 
which i was sorry about gielgud told the british broadcasting 
corp on tuesday 
but i wouldnt dream of putting myself up as a rival to him in 
talent or equipment because he had this extraordinary range of 
classical ability and comedy he was a great comedian and a very 
fine tragic actor 
across londons west end theater marquees dimmed their lights 
for an hour in new york city broadway theaters followed suit 
dimming their lights for one minute at curtain time 
flags were lowered to halfstaff outside the national theater and 
the royal shakespeare company in stratforduponavon the birthplace 
of shakespeare the nationals marquee said merely lord olivier 
19071989 
praise for olivier began where his gifts first flowered on 
stage 
at the national theater which olivier founded in 1963 veteran 
actor michael bryant told the audience following a performance of 
the voysey inheritance i personally will not be lachrymose 
ill be thinking of things like the crispins day speech now 
is the winter of our discontent his young magnetic handsome 
heathcliff said bryant 
he referred to oliviers famed performances in shakespeares 
henry v and richard iii and as the tragic film hero in the 
classic wuthering heights they were the three high points of 
the late actors long and distinguished career on stage screen and 
television 
at the nationals lyttelton theater actor edward petherbridge 
stopped a curtain call for the misanthrope to ask the audience 
to stand for a moment of silence before one final round of applause 
id like us just to applaud especially in case he olivier is 
listening petherbridge said his voice choked with emotion 
a rare fusion of superb classical and extraordinary contemporary 
actor olivier summed up the english theater according to 
theatergoer pat fairbairn a civil servant 
but another adeline hartcup said his ego got in the way 
to most observers olivier was the consummate british artist he 
distinguished himself in theater and found fame and fortune on 
screen 
oliviers adventuresome style freed the stage from the talking 
heads elegance of some of his forbears 
actor jeremy brett said of olivier the thing one will always 
remember is that however many times youd seen him it was probably 
the most dangerously thrilling moment youd seen on any stage 
anthony hopkins said he was constantly struck by the actors 
tremendous athletic daring 
in order to test himself he would hurl himself into the role 
and that can be quite dangerous to limb and body said hopkins 
who understudied olivier in august strindbergs dance of death 
in 1967 hopkins went on to costar alongside olivier in the films 
a bridge too far and the bounty 
denis quilley who starred with olivier in a 1971 stage revival 
of long days journey into night said olivier never gave up 
he worked like a dog and was never satisfied until he got what 
he thought was right said quilley 
as far as im concerned the man was cloaked in an aura of 
greatness jack lemmon said through his publicist no actor that 
i know of that has lived in my lifetime made me more proud to be 
in the same profession 
said reagan sir laurence olivier delighted millions with his 
unmatched excellence on the stage and screen some of the 
greatest moments in the history of the performing arts came as a 
result of sir laurences brilliance 
charlton heston a close friend who worked with olivier in the 
1966 film khartoum called him an amazingly daring actor the 
best of our time 
i had the privilege of working with him on both stage and 
screen and his advice to me has proven an inestimable value 
oliviers vicar said today he will conduct a private funeral 
service for the actor friday at an undisclosed protestant church 
the rev peter burch vicar of st andrews parish church near 
oliviers home in ashurst 50 miles south of london said the 
service will be followed by cremation 
a public memorial service will be held later in london he said 
details have not been announced

for the first time the iron curtain has begun to part and 
hungary your great country is leading the way 
the soviet union has withdrawn troops which i also take as a 
step in overcoming europes division and as those forces leave let 
the soviet leaders know they have everything to gain and nothing to 
lose or fear from peaceful change we can and i am determined that 
we will work together to move beyond containment beyond the cold 
war 
one of the key steps in moving beyond containment is easing the 
military confrontation in europe to this end the nato allies 
joined at the may summit meeting in my proposal of a comprehensive 
conventional arms control initiative an initiative that would cut 
the number of tanks armored troop carriers artillery combat 
aircraft attack helicopters as well as united states and soviet 
troops stationed on foreign soil in europe all to lower equal 
levels 
the issues may be complex but were working day and night to 
get a solid historic agreement to strengthen stability in europe and 
reduce the risk of war and we are determined to get it soon 
now there is no mistaking the fact that we are on the threshold 
of a new era and theres also no mistaking the fact that hungary is 
at the threshold of great and historic change 
youre writing a real constitution and youre moving toward 
democratic multiparty elections and this is partly possible 
because brave men and women have formed opposition parties and this 
is possible because hungarian leaders are going to show the ultimate 
political courage the courage to submit to the choice of the people 
in free elections 
but to succeed in reform youll need partners partners to help 
promote lasting change in hungary and i am here today to offer 
hungary the partnership of the united states of america 
three vital spheres stand out in our partnership economics the 
environment and democratic and cultural exchange the united states 
believes in the acceleration of productive change not in its delay 
so this is our guiding principle the united states will offer 
assistance not to prop up the status quo but to propel reform 
of course the weight of the past still burdens hungarian 
enterprise there are remnants of the stalinist economy huge 
inefficient industrial plants and a bewildering price system thats 
hard for anyone to understand and the massive subsidies that cloud 
economic decisions all of this slows what you could otherwise 
achieve 
its an economic rubiks cone it defies solution to make the 
transition to a productive economy will test your mettle as a 
people the prices of some commodities may rise some inefficient 
businesses and factories will close 
but the hungarian government is increasingly leaving the business 
of running the shops to the shopkeepers the farms to the farmers 
and the creative drive of the people once unleashed will create 
momentum of its own 
and this will bring you a greater treasure than simply the riches 
you create it will give each of you control over your own destiny 
a hungarian destiny and as i said the united states will be your 
partner in this transformation to a successful economy

some national rifle association members are 
signing petitions to oust president bush from the organization 
because of his decision to ban imports of semiautomatic assault 
rifles 
but the white house says bush who last friday permanently banned 
imports of 43 styles of the weapons has no intention of resigning 
his lifetime nra membership 
the presidents a good solid member of the nra always has 
been always will be spokesman b jay cooper said tuesday 
weve done nothing that goes against the second amendment which 
ensures the right of citizens to keep and bear arms 
wayne lapierre executive director of the nra institute for 
legislative action said a lot of people are very upset about 
this because many voted for bush because of his opposition to gun 
control laws 
president bush ran on a no more federal gun control pledge 
lapierre said people believed that when they heard candidate bush 
say that the pledge couldnt have been any clearer 
the petition drive is not something the organization is 
undertaking said lapierre but he said the sentiment is 
certainly understandable there is an awful lot of 
disillusionment around the country 
anthony j hilder a radio talkshow host in anchorage who is 
spearheading the petition drive in alaska said he gathered 400 
signatures over the weekend at a gun show there 
similar petition drives are under way in 22 other states and the 
district of columbia hilder said 
bush took office maintaining there was no need for more gun 
control but he began to reassess that view following a public 
outcry over the increasing popularity of highpowered assault 
weapons among drug dealers and the slaying of five children in a 
stockton calif schoolyard in january by a man wielding an ak47 
first lady barbara bush was among those saying such guns should 
be banned 
the bush administration friday banned imports of 43 styles of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons including the popular 
chinesemade ak47 and the israelimade uzi carbine 
usmade weapons are not affected but bush called in may for a 
magazine limit of 15 rounds even more stringent than the 20 rounds 
sought in a bill pushed by sen howard metzenbaum dohio that also 
would ban many domestic weapons 
stephen e higgins director of the treasury departments bureau 
of alcohol tobacco and firearms said the permanent import ban on 
the 43 styles was required because the weapons did not meet the 
standards imposed by the gun control act of 1968 that law bars 
importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting 
purposes 
lapierre said it takes only one complaint by one nra member that 
another member has violated the organizations bylaws to get a 
person considered for suspension or expulsion from the nra one 
bylaw requires that members protect and defend the constitution in 
particular the second amendment 
a single nra member can call for the expulsion of another member 
by alleging a violation of nra bylaws the groups ethics committee 
considers complaints 
if the committee recommends suspension or expulsion the member 
is given 30 days to request a hearing after a hearing the 
committees final recommendation is considered by the 75member nra 
board

hundreds of thousands of moslems from 
80 countries today prayed on mount arafat as part of the annual 
pilgrimage to islams holiest city 
police meanwhile searched for terrorists responsible for two 
explosions monday that killed one person and wounded 16 in mecca 
king fahd arrived at sunrise today to supervise the pilgrimage 
or hajj in the wake of the explosions fahd whose official title 
is custodian of the holy shrines has been assuring arab and islamic 
leaders that the kingdom will ensure the sanctity of the holy sites 
and the safety of the pilgrims 
security sources said a number of suspects in the bombings have 
been arrested for interrogation the king said there would be no 
mercy to the perpetrators saudi papers charged that iran was 
behind the bombings 
the blasts occurred near the grand mosque moslems around the 
world turn their faces toward the draped edifice in prayer five 
times a day 
in 110degree heat the throngs today shouted labaika allahumah 
labaika or we respond to your summons o lord 
the state radio and television broadcast the rituals to scores of 
moslem countries via satellite 
the hajj culminates at dawn thursday when hajjis slit the 
throats of sheep and start the threeday eid aladha or feast of 
sacrifice this commemorates prophet abrahams readiness to 
sacrifice his son ismail at gods behest 
by official saudi count 774560 pilgrims from 80 countries came 
from overseas for this years hajj they were joined by 500000 
others from within saudi arabia in addition an estimated 600000 
saudis converged on mecca and medina to provide services and 
facilities 
a previously unknown organization calling itself the angry arab 
generation claimed responsibility for the blasts monday but the 
claim made in beirut was all but ignored 
iran condemned the blasts and blamed them on the united states 
and saudi arabia the iranians have called for the removal of the 
saudi rulers because of the restrictions on the number of pilgrims 
the hajj has been turbulent since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
gained power in iran in february 1979 religious extremists seized 
the grand mosque in mecca that year and held it for two weeks 
saudi forces stormed the mosque and more than 250 people were 
killed including 100 extremists saudi authorities later beheaded 
63 more 
in 1986 the saudis arrested scores of iranian revolutionary 
guards who posed as pilgrims and tried to smuggle in weapons and 
explosives 
in 1987 iranian pilgrims demonstrated in mecca and clashed with 
riot police and 402 pilgrims died 
saudi arabia broke its diplomatic ties with tehran in april 1988

last thursday at the white house i invited leaders from 
business education and labor and other fields to come to the white 
house and discuss the new private sector opportunities opening up in 
hungary and their response was enthusiastic 
this was especially true of hungarian americans so proud to be 
building a bridge between their new country and their mother land 
as long as our two governments ease the way the people of america 
and hungary can do the rest the people can do the rest 
and it is in this spirit that i want to announce the following 
measures 
first as i said in warsaw i will propose at the paris economic 
summit concerted western action for poland and hungary to back your 
reforms with economic and technical assistance from the summit 
partners of course our efforts for hungary will be targeted to 
your needs 
and second i will ask the united states congress to authorize a 
25 million fund as a source of new capital to invigorate the 
hungarian private sector ill also encourage parallel efforts from 
the other nations of the economic summit 
and third once your parliament passes the new emigration 
legislation proposed by your council of ministers i will inform our 
congress that hungary is in full compliance with the jacksonvanik 
amendments to our 1974 trade law 
no country has yet been released from the restrictions of this 
amendment so i am pleased to tell you that hungary will be the 
first and this action will give hungary the most liberal access to 
the american market for the longest terms possible under our laws 
fourth america is prepared to provide your country with access 
to our generalized system of preferences which offers selective 
tariff relief 
simply put these last two measures will allow you to take 
advantage of the largest single market in the entire world 
and fifth weve concluded a draft agreement to authorize the 
overseas private investment corporation opic we call it to 
operate in hungary and once our senate passes the enabling 
legislation opic will be able to provide insurance to encourage 
american investment in private enterprises in hungary through opic 
american business executives will see firsthand the great 
opportunity of hungary 
private investment is critical for hungary it means jobs 
innovation progress but most of all private investment means a 
brighter future for your children a brighter future for hungary 
and yet economic progress cannot be at the expense of the air we 
breathe and the water we drink six weeks ago in mainz i proposed 
cooperation between east and west on environmental issues 
and that is why i will ask the united states congress to 
appropriate 5 million to establish an international environmental 
center for central and eastern europe to be based right here in 
budapest which will bring together private and government experts 
and organizations to address the ecological crisis 
after all our shared heritage is the earth and the fate of the 
earth transcends borders it isnt just an eastwest issue hungary 
has led eastern and central europe in addressing the concerns of 
your citizens for cleaner air and water and now you can do even 
more working with the west to build a bridge of technical and 
scientific cooperation 
along these lines im also pleased to announce that the united 
states has proposed an agreement between our two countries to 
establish scientific and technical cooperation in the basic sciences 
and in specific areas including the environment medicine and 
nuclear safety 
it is my hope that this visit will also lead to a wider exchange 
between east and west so our scientists our artists and our 
environmentalists can learn from one another so that our soldiers 
and statesmen can discuss peace and our students god bless them 
can discuss the future 
but to discuss anything requires a common language the teaching 
of the english language is one of the most popular american exports 
and as students you know that english is the lingua franca of world 
business the key to clinching deals from hong kong to toronto 
so to open the global market to more hungarians i am pleased to 
announce that the peace corps will for the first time operate in a 
european country and our peace corps instructors will come to 
budapest and all 19 counties to teach english 
and in such exchanges we want to help you in your quest for a 
new beginning as a democratic hungary so the united states is also 
committing more than 6 million to cultural and educational 
opportunities in eastern europe 
we will make available funds for a series of major new 
ushungarian exchange programs among congressmen and legislative 
experts among labor and business leaders among legal experts 
among community leaders educators and young people 
we are creating dozens of fellowships to enable hungarians to 
study at american universities and we will fund endowed chairs in 
american studies at your universities and books many thousands of 
them to fill the shelves of your new international management 
center and the libraries of schools and universities across hungary 
and the united states will also open within the next several 
years an american house in the center of budapest today the 
celebrated american architect robert stern is releasing his design 
for this center which will be an open house of books magazines 
and videocassettes an open house of ideas 
and so in conclusion in economic reform and democratic change 
in cultural and environmental cooperation there are great 
opportunities and great challenges 
hungary has a lot of work ahead and so do the united states and 
hungary working together to build this better future a dynamic 
future 
your challenge is enormous and historic to build a structure of 
political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the ruins 
of a failed stalinist system and given the opportunity to show your 
characteristic initiative creativity and resourcefulness i believe 
that the hungarian people will meet the challenge 
you stand on the threshold of a new era of economic development 
and yes political change and i believe with all my heart that you 
are ready to meet the future 
i see a country well on the way i see a country rich in human 
resources rich in the moral courage of its people i see a nation 
transcending its past and reaching out to its destiny 
i congratulate you for having come so far and let us be equal to 
the opportunity that lies before us let us have history write of us 
that we were the generation that made europe whole and free 
thank you all god bless each and every one of you thank you 
very much

white house chief of staff john sununu 
apologized today for comparing poles to children in a candy store 
who cant say no 
i apologize for the metaphor but i think the point was 
correct he told a press briefing here the second stop on 
president bushs 10day european tour 
sununu made his original comment monday in an nbctv interview 
when he said bush would not thrust a huge amount of money on the 
table to help poland with its staggering economic problems 
explaining why substantial funds would be inappropriate sununu 
replied well the analogue thats almost appropriate is you 
cant create the problem of a young person in the candy store where 
there is some much there that they dont know which direction to 
take and dont have the selfdiscipline to take the right steps 
asked today about the remark the chief of staff said he was 
trying to make the point that money given to poland in the 1970s was 
misspent and didnt really help that country 
they acknowledge that the utilization of those funds did not 
always focus on the most critical needs that poland had 
the metaphor may have been bad and i apologize for the 
metaphor sununu said

the pittsburgh postgazette has paid a 277 
million libel judgment awarded to a lawyer who was the subject of a 
1979 story over a will he prepared 
it was the largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper and 
the secondlargest judgment upheld by us courts according to the 
postgazette the largest was a 3 million libel award last year 
against cbs news 
but the newspapers editor john g craig jr said today that he 
believes the libel decision is a particular pennsylvania problem 
and wont have nationwide repercussions 
a westmoreland county jury ruled in 1985 that the newspaper 
libeled richard disalle a former state and appellate judge of 
washington county the payment was for 2 million in punitive 
damages 210000 in actual damages and interest accumulated since 
the verdict 
the payment check was signed tuesday by officers of pg publishing 
co the newspapers parent firm it was paid to disalle his wife 
joan and daniel berger the attorney who represented them in the 
case 
at issue was a sept 10 1979 article about the disputed will of 
millionaire paul ciaffoni the article contained allegations made in 
court documents by some relatives that the will was fraudulently 
altered and that disalle had a close relationship with the 
coexecutor ciaffonis youngest daughter 
the judge instructed the jury that under state libel law 
publications about judicial proceedings are immune from legal 
responsibility even if they contain information that defames an 
individual the judge said however that newspapers give up that 
immunity if an article is not a fair summary of those court 
proceedings 
last month the us supreme court refused to review the case 
i just dont see the decision on neutral reporting privilege 
becoming nationwide because its a very peculiar decision craig 
said but i think in pennsylvania until its overturned which 
im sure it will be it will cause newspapers a lot of trouble 
you just cannot be involved in a situation like this and not 
have a profound effect on you craig said what it does is bring 
home for you the risk involved in the kind of business were in and 
so you have really a dual responsibility one is to be conscious of 
the risks and execute your business with a great deal of precision 
and care concurrently however you cannot spend your life looking 
over your shoulder because people pay you to tell them whats going 
on part of that is reporting on public life thats what happened 
in this instance 
the postgazette is suing one of its insurance carriers national 
surety corp which has refused to pay the 2 million punitive 
damages in the case 
in a lawsuit filed in may the newspaper argued that its primary 
insurance carrier had agreed to pay 1 million to cover the award 
and attorneys fees the lawsuit charged that national which 
provides excess insurance coverage is refusing to pay 
the insurance company argued that pennsylvania law did not permit 
insurance carriers to pay punitive damages in the lawsuit

service officer ronald a degueldre an 8000 gold rolex wristwatch

save 100000 sudanese threatened by famine and disease the 
operations director says 
james p grant the un secretarygenerals special 
representative for operation lifeline sudan spoke tuesday at a 
fundraising conference where almost 10 million was raised toward 
the 200million relief effort 
the operation is the first example of both sides involved in a 
civil war providing safe passage so food and medicines can reach all 
parts of the country said grant 
until this year efforts in sudan were hampered by the government 
or guerrillas refusing to allow supplies into areas controlled by 
the other side 
however operation lifeline needs another 40 million to extend 
its work through november and guarantee food is distributed grant 
told reporters 
with that amount grant said we are confident that last years 
disaster can be avoided operation lifeline sudan is on a successful 
track 
the united nations estimates 250000 sudanese died last year from 
starvation due to flood drought and warinduced famine 
grants project sought to get 120000 tons of food into villages 
before the monsoon isolates peasants over 85000 tons has been 
delivered 
monsoons that make roads and airstrips impassable have hit full 
force but grant said he hopes relief workers have time to deliver 
the rest of the supplies by nile river barge light planes and 
trucks 
sudans entire fleet of over 50 barges has been trapped in the 
besieged government garrison in southern malakal since early this 
year 
frightened soldiers were holding the tugboats and barges in case 
they needed to escape from the rebels said grant the garrison now 
has agreed to let operation lifeline have 18 barges and three 
tugboats he said a trial delivery of supplies to malakal would be 
attempted today said grant

their campaign but grant said he met the coup leader lt gen omar 
hassan ahmed elbashir and he took great pains to reaffirm the 
support of the new government to continuing operation lifeline 
sudan 
elbashir has said one of the reasons he ousted prime minister 
sadek elmahdis civilian government is because it failed to stop 
the war

president mengistu haile mariam has agreed to mediate peace talks 
with the rebels 
lt col mohammed elamin khalifa a member of sudans ruling

president bush declaring that the 
iron curtain has begun to part promised today to give hungary 
unlimited access to american markets and said he would sent the 
first peace corps volunteers ever dispatched to a communist nation 
warmly applauded by his audience at karl marx university bush 
also offered a 25 million grant to spur this reformminded east 
bloc nations fledgling freeenterprise system 
saluting political and economic reforms here bush said there is 
no mistaking the fact that hungary is at the threshold of great 
and historic change 
the president said hungarys enormous challenge is to build a 
structure of political change and decentralized economic enterprise 
on the ruins of a failed stalinist system 
bushs speech which was broadcast live on hungarian television 
followed talks with hungarian leaders who presented him with a 
plaque containing barbed wire fencing torn down along the austrian 
border 
in his speech bush noted that barbed wire separating hungary and 
austria had been dismantled and stacked into bales earlier this year 
for the first time the iron curtain has begun to part and 
hungary your great country is leading the way bush said 
standing against a backdrop of huge hungarian and american flags 
with those words his audience of several hundred students and 
professors burst into applause they also gave him a standing 
ovation at the end 
bush noted that the soviet union had withdrawn some troops from 
hungary and assured soviet leaders they have nothing to lose or 
fear from peaceful change 
said bush we can and i am determined that we will work 
together to move beyond containment beyond the cold war 
making the same offer he presented in poland the president 
promised that the united states will be your partner as hungary 
tries to establish economic freedoms 
i believe you are ready to meet the future bush said i 
see a country well on the way i see a country rich in human 
resources and rich in moral courage of its people i see a nation 
transcending its past and reaching out to its destiny 
bush did not link the assistance with any demands for austerity 
as he did earlier this week during his visit to warsaw the first 
stop on a 10day european tour 
white house chief of staff john sununu said that in his talks 
with hungarian leaders bush emphasized he would be thrilled if 
soviet troops withdrew from hungary and the united states would be 
able to remove its troops from europe 
however white house press secretary marlin fitzwater played down 
that remark saying there were no strategic plans or political 
maneuvering behind it and that it was simply a philosophical 
statement by bush 
the president earlier had rankled soviet leaders by saying he 
would like to see all red army troops withdrawn from poland a 
suggestion that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev dismissed as 
propaganda 
fitzwater said bush explained to hungarian leaders today that i 
simply made a philosophical comment about the troops that got 
everybody upset 
hungarian officials seemed satisfied with bushs aid proposals 
the americans are not selling us the fish but the net said 
tamas beck the foreign trade minister we want to use other 
peoples experiences but we dont want to copy the systems of 
others said laszlo kovacs state secretary in the foreign 
ministry 
kovacs said foreign minister gyula horn told secretary of state 
james a baker iii in a separate meeting that hungary would welcome 
a delegation of economic experts from the sevennation summit of 
industrial democracies meeting in paris this weekend to help promote 
hungarys industrial modernization bush flies to paris from hungary 
on thursday to attend the economic summit 
sununu explained that hungary has taken many steps toward a 
freeenterprise system and said they are quite justifiably proud 
the white house said the peace corps volunteers being sent here 
will assist hungarian efforts to develop and expand englishlanguage 
teaching russianlanguage training is no longer required in 
schools and hungarian officials have expressed interest in 
expanding the use of english here 
in offering the peace corps volunteers bush said the teaching 
of english is one of the most popular american exports 
the volunteer teachers who come here will help open the global 
market to more hungarians bush said 
sununu said the peace corps program would be the first not only 
in europe but anywhere in a communist nation 
the united states announced plans this spring to send peace corps 
volunteers to china but in the wake of the unrest there chinese 
officials have delayed accepting the americans 
bush said the 25 million grant that he will seek from congress 
would be used to create an enterprise fund to help hungary expand 
its private sector which although small is the most extensive in 
eastern europe 
the program is identical in purpose to one bush announced earlier 
in warsaw but with only a quarter of the 100 million in 
development funds designated for poland 
sununu explained that hungary has a population of only 10 million 
people compared with 37 million in poland he said the gift to 
budapest was roughly proportional 
among other steps bush said he will ask congress for 5 million 
to establish a regional environmental center in budapest for 
cooperative research among government and outside experts dealing 
with nuclear safety and energy issues 
in promising to eliminate trade barriers against hungary bush 
said he planned to grant this country a permanent status as most 
favored nation accorded to americas trade friends the only 
requirement is for hungary to formally enact its new emigration law 
removing all obstacles to emigration 
it is expected to be passed by the end of the year making 
hungary the first warsaw pact country deemed in full compliance with 
the jacksonvanik law imposing trade barriers in retaliation for 
emigration restrictions 
earlier bush met in the sprawling parliament building on the 
banks of the danube river with communist party general secretary 
karoly grosz government leader rezso nyers and premier miklos 
nemeth 
the hungarian leaders gave the president and baker brass cases 
containing barbed wire cut from the iron curtain that has been 
dismantled along hungarys border with austria 
an inscription read in part its believed that the artificial 
and spiritual walls still existing in the world shall collapse 
someday everywhere 
bush thanked nemeth and said that is just beautiful thats a 
marvelous symbol of this whole visit 
bushs speech was another step in his delicate campaign during 
his 10day european tour to encourage democratic freedoms in 
communist lands without antagonizing the soviet union 
sununu said in a television interview with cable news network 
that he did not think the soviets were taking offense at bushs 
visits to poland and hungary preceding the allied economic summit 
i think it is clear that the soviet union recognizes that 
the efforts the president is taking are designed to stabilize 
rather than destabilize he said and i think that it is not 
only being well received here but around the world 
besides the dismantling of the iron curtain on the austrian 
border the soviet union has withdrawn thousands of troops and tanks 
in recent months from hungary where red army troops crushed a 
democratic uprising in 1956 
hungary has been at the forefront of economic reforms in the 
communist bloc since the 1960s encouraging private entrepreneurs 
and boasting an energetic stock market with about 150 listings 
consumer goods are plentiful but expensive on the other hand 
hungarys nearly 18 billion foreign debt is the highest per capita 
in eastern europe

president bush pulled out a wad of 
hungarian money and did his bit for free enterprise today in a 
bustling produce market 
bush after his speech at karl marx university went shopping at 
the market on nearby dimitrov square the same one where british 
prime minister margaret thatcher purchased garlic and peppers on a 
1983 visit 
bush had sweeter fare in mind a dozen ripe peaches that cost 18 
hungarian forints a kilo or about 14 cents a pound 
that was cheap for the president of the united states but close 
to an hours wage for the average hungarian 
i recommend these to you he told reporters who trailed him 
through the crowd of shoppers and vendors 
an ebullient bush shook hands and signed autographs for the 
crowd and blew kisses with his hand 
he was greeted with applause wherever he went in the ornate 
wrought iron market built late in the 19th century where vendors 
sell succulent heaps of fruit vegetables meat and other produce 
from hungarys rich farming land 
most of the produce comes from small private plots 
earlier before going to the university bush met for half an 
hour with 13 students from all over hungary five were members of 
fidesz an outspoken youth group formed last year as a rival to the 
official communist youth league which has since disintegrated 
bush gave two of the students a ride in his limousine to the 
university

airport after she was separated from her family as a result of a 
series of misunderstandings police said 
initially it was feared the woman might have been left behind by 
relatives but that turned out not to be the case police said 
tuesday 
irene rodriguez wandered around los angeles international airport 
after she went there july 5 to board a flight to lincoln neb and 
found there was no ticket waiting for her finally she asked 
airport officials for help 
police began a criminal investigation believing that pages in 
the womans address book were torn out that her bank account had 
been cleaned out and because officers were unable to locate her 
children 
but her son robin breadwell 39 and his 47yearold wife 
emily 47 reported his mother missing when they arrived in lincoln 
after driving there their trip was delayed by vehicle troubles 
said police detective mel arnold 
it was just a tragic incident probably a communications gap 
arnold said it all worked out ok i guess 
ms rodriguez was undernourished and dehydrated after her ordeal 
she was hospitalized sunday after finally seeking help and was 
listed in good condition today at the medical center in tarzana 
breadwell told authorities he reserved a ticket for his mother 
july 3 but apparently his credit card purchase had not cleared in 
time for the ticket to be issued arnold said 
ms rodriguez said she ate in airport cafeterias until her pocket 
money ran out and slept in seats in the airport waiting areas a 
carryon bag was reportedly stolen during her ordeal 
arnold did not explain why authorities initially believed the 
womans address book had been tampered with or whether breadwell was 
authorized to close his mothers bank account 
the breadwells reportedly were moving her furniture to nebraska 
overland after buying her a home in lincoln so that she could be 
closer to them

under the car of tel avivs mayor while it was parked outside his 
home 
mayor shlomo lahat said people who oppose plans to demolish an 
illegally built home and close an unlicensed business may have been 
responsible 
but police spokeswoman etti greenberg said the motive was not 
known she described the explosive as small and refused to 
elaborate

a small gas tank rigged with a few wires 
ms greenberg said the bomb was spotted by a neighbor early today 
beneath the mayors car in north tel aviv police are investigating 
in all directions to determine who is responsible ms greenberg 
said by telephone 
lahat 62 told army radio he believed the assailants were trying 
to warn him not to close an unlicensed business or raze an illegally 
built house he did not specify which business or home he was 
referring to 
it is what you may call a warning not for something done but a 
decision that is supposed to be taken that is my feeling lahat 
said whoever thinks they will deter me from my job is mistaken 
tel aviv on the mediterranean coast is the countrys economic 
and social center it is home to 350000 israelis including 7500

trade unions today distributed 
hundreds of posters bearing a likeness of african national congress 
leader nelson mandela defying a law banning reproduction of 
prisoners pictures 
mandela who has been in prison since 1962 is serving a life 
term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the government 
after his imprisonment no pictures of him were published in 
south africa until a small photograph appeared in a government 
handbook three years ago several newspapers later published that 
picture 
however the photograph showed mandela at age 45 he will be 71 
next week 
last year according to sources an artist was commissioned to 
produce a current likeness of mandela and did so from descriptions 
of the few people who have been allowed to visit him in prison 
a color drawing was printed on a poster and distributed today at 
the opening of the annual meeting of the congress of south african 
trade unions

company credit neither officials of the labor congress nor their 
attorneys would discuss the origin of the picture

1962 a picture of him was taken surreptitiously in 1966 at robben 
island prison 
mandela met july 5 with president pw botha the talks at 
bothas official residence fueled speculation that mandela may soon

defense secretary dick cheney says he has no 
magic formula to eliminate fraud and waste from pentagon purchasing 
but he believes his new reorganization plan can save taxpayers at 
least 30 billion by 1993 
cheneys plan unveiled tuesday includes proposals to reduce the 
number of individuals involved in purchasing decisions by the 
thousands and to limit the authority of individual military services 
to complete deals 
still cheney told reporters theres no silver bullet here 
we have a blueprint that we plan to pursue to try to 
significantly improve the way we do business he said if were 
going to be successful it will be because we got congress to 
cooperate 
cheney acted immediately to reorganize his toplevel management 
team but other parts of his plan will need congressional approval 
his report was requested by president bush five months ago in 
response to weapons procurement scandals that have rocked the 
pentagon in the last two years 
federal prosecutors ill wind investigation has focused on 
bribery by consultants who sought inside information for their 
clients on pending military contracts 
cheney said central to his plan is giving the undersecretary of 
defense increased authority over purchasing decisions by the 
individual services he said he intends to eliminate several layers 
of top management to establish a clear chain of command on such 
decisions 
members of defenserelated committees in congress gave cheneys 
proposal cautious support sen jeff bingham dnm called the 
report a good start while sen john mccain rariz said it is 
bound to improve on the absolutely inefficient purchasing system 
of the past

there are 24 seats in the assembly six of which are assigned to 
minority parties who failed to win any of the 18 races

the french appeals court has refused to allow two 
homosexual couples to enjoy the same rights as those given to 
unmarried heterosexual couples living together 
the judgment of the court published tuesday invalidated the 
decision of lower courts in the two cases the decision cannot be 
appealed further 
in one case an air france flight attendant identified as yves 
surnames were withheld demanded that his livein companion serge 
be granted reduced fares and other benefits that air france grants 
to employees living with members of the opposite sex 
in the second case the mother of three children nadia set up 
house with her friend annie and sought to obtain health insurance 
for annie from the social security administration she was turned 
down on the ground that french legislation concerning unmarried 
cohabitation applies only to men and women 
the appeals court ruling simultaneously on both cases said they 
did not fall within the law of january 2 1978 which defined the 
legal meaning of unmarried cohabitation 
this law the appeals court ruled concerned two people who have 
decided to live together as man and wife without the benefit of 
marriage and can therefore only concern a couple formed by a man 
and a woman

television evangelist rex humbard 
testified today that he once hitched a ride on a private jet with 
ptl executives but did not know the trip was charged to david 
taggarts personal credit card 
humbard a former ptl board member who has been a tv evangelist 
for 36 years said he did not know why taggart charged the 3899 
flight which included a 200 tip on his personal card and then 
sought reimbursement from ptl the august 1985 flight was from 
charlotte to florida 
david taggart and his brother james are charged with failing to 
pay 487000 in income taxes from 1984 to 1987 federal prosecutors 
say the brothers both former ptl officials diverted 11 million 
of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on 
ptl credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit 
card bills 
humbard who said his ministry staff includes 15 family members 
testified that he does not allow any expenditures over 10000 that 
have not been approved by the board of directors 
its quite regimented isnt it sir federal prosecutor david 
brown asked humbard whose ministry started in akron ohio and has 
been headquartered in the resort town of boca raton fla for thtside 
the budget without 
authorization from the board of directors 
on tuesday a former ptl financial officer testified that he did 
not think he would get help from ministry founder jim bakker in 
getting documentation explaining 200000 in cash advances to david 
taggart 
i had the distinct feeling i wouldnt get a lot of help said 
peter bailey the ministrys former vice president for finance 
bailey said david taggart refused to submit documentation for the 
cash advances despite repeated requests 
he assured me he had the documents or he was working on the 
documentation bailey testified david told me the receipts were 
being maintained on the third floor the ministrys executive 
offices for reasons of confidentiality 
bailey said ptl eventually had to write off the 215578 in 
outstanding cash advances david taggart had accumulated by november 
1985 
as vice president of finance at ptl why did you not demand 
that david taggart turn over his receipts brown asked 
we did the best we could we tried to get the receipts on many 
occasions we just couldnt do it bailey responded 
the brothers were indicted in december the day that ptl founder 
bakker and his former top assistant richard dortch were indicted on 
mail and wire fraud charges bakker and dortch face trial aug 28 
it was not uncommon for him to request a 10000 cash 
advance bailey said 
how without the documentation would you substantiate that the 
money was spent on ptl business brown asked 
i had to take mr taggarts word for it bailey responded 
he was my boss and i had no choice but i had no reason not to 
believe him 
bailey testified that the only control he had over taggarts use 
of ministry credit cards was the 100000 credit limit imposed by 
mastercard and visa 
he also testified he once pledged a 75000 certificate of 
deposit owned by ptl as collateral for a loan taggart needed to buy 
a 640000 apartment in new yorks trump tower 
but he said he did not recall signing a threepage statement for 
a mortgage on the apartment that incorrectly said taggart was 
president of ptl and inflated his salary to 150000 a year 
taggart at the time was a vice president for administration and 
earned about 90000 prosecutors said 
bailey also testified that three blank checks were issued to 
david taggart shortly before bakkers resignation in march 1987 he 
said the checks were used by the taggarts to pay off their personal 
american express bills 
one check totaled 50000 followed by one for 45000 and a 
third for 30000 bailey testified 
a fourth check for 15000 was written to american express 
about three weeks before bakkers resignation he said 
the trial which began last week has outlined the expensive 
shopping habits of the two brothers witnesses have testified that 
besides the new york apartment the brothers owned a 330000 home in 
charlotte and regularly purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of jewelry and designer clothes 
if convicted on the tax evasion charges each could be sentenced 
to 25 years in prison and fined about 1 million

lawmakers today warned air force officials that 
the halfbilliondollar b2 stealth bomber faces a tough uphill 
fight in congress despite the warplanes strategic importance 
put it in perspective or theres a real possibility that the 
b2 will become a museum piece rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee told air force officials at 
the start of a hearing on the radarevading plane 
air force secretary donald rice and chief of staff gen larry 
welch using a colorslide presentation argued that the plane 
outpaces improvements in soviet air defenses and that failure to 
build the bomber would undermine the nations nuclear deterrent 
force 
the air force argument marked the second day in a row that 
officials took their case to congress rice and welch made a similar 
presentation to the senate armed services committee on tuesday 
at the start of todays hearing republicans as well as democrats 
served notice that the b2 faces serious opposition in a 
budgetminded congress 
the b2 program is in a lot of trouble a lot of difficulty 
its not technical problems but the price tag said rep william 
dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the house armed services 
panel 
the air force campaign comes amid growing opposition to the 
bomber which recent estimates indicate would be the most expensive 
aircraft in history at 500 million to 750 million a copy 
last month sen john glenn dohio a member of the senate armed 
services panel urged defense secretary dick cheney to suspend 
production of the b2 because the aircraft has not been tested in 
flight 
glenn a former astronaut and test pilot said pursuing 
production of the plane violates the rule of fly before buy 
two weeks ago a house amendment to the fiscal 1990 defense bill 
proposing cancellation of the program failed but the armed services 
panel did approve cutting 500 million from the programs 
procurement budget 
since then the pentagon announced late friday the first flight 
tests of the bomber 18 months behind schedule would be held 
during the next two weeks and on monday the bomber moved under its 
own power when it taxied along a mojave desert runway 
this week while the senate committee votes on the military 
budget and the house prepares to take up defense spending later this 
month rice and welch are presenting their case to lawmakers cheney 
is scheduled to appear before the house panel on thursday 
the pentagon is proposing a 47 billion budget in fiscal 1990 
for the b2 manufactured by northrop corp in palmdale calif 
the plane will cost about 24 billion over a threeyear peak period 
beginning in fiscal 1992 according to defense department figures 
the department has invested about 224 billion in the plane so 
far 
one republican member of the senate armed services pane said he 
was not swayed by tuesdays lobbying campaign 
i have serious concerns about the aircraft said sen john 
mccain of arizona i may not go as far as senator glenn but the 
air force must prove this aircraft before fullscale production 
mccain said the service with the runway test monday and a maiden 
flight in a few weeks is conveying the appearance of only meeting 
milestones in the face of congressional pressures 
rice and welch told senators the pentagon estimates the soviet 
union has spent more than 350 billion on air defense over a 20year 
period and plans to invest more money 
that very expensive array of defenses is largely ineffective 
against an aircraft with b2 capabilities the air force said in 
an 18page report 
although rice and welch met in closed session with the senate 
panel the ranking members democratic chairman sam nunn of georgia 
and republican john warner of virginia released the air force 
report 
the air force also said the b2 can make a powerful 
contribution with its conventional capability the plane can cover 
all the worlds land areas from any of three locations the 
whiteman base in missouri diego garcia in the indian ocean and guam 
with a single air refueling 
the air force said a small force of b2s could have had the same 
success that two carrier battle groups and about 120 aircraft had in 
the 1986 raid on libya

housing secretary jack kemp said today problems 
in the scandalplagued department he took over this year should not 
be allowed to give private enterprise a bad name 
the government stands to lose an estimated 2 billion from 
several abused programs in the department of housing and urban 
development which is under investigation by congress the justice 
department and the agencys own inspector general 
i dont want the problems we are confronting to give private 
enterprise a bad name kemp told the house banking finance and 
urban affairs committee 
the department is under investigation for influence peddling in 
which wellknown republicans or former hud employees in private 
business used their connections to get government funds for specific 
housing projects 
during his testimony tuesday before the house government 
operations subcommittee on housing and employment kemp agreed that 
2 billion was a valid estimate for potential losses to the 
government rep charles schumer dny based his estimate on 
potential losses from bad loans inflated costs passed along to the 
government and outright theft that has occurred at hud 
its a ballpark figure kemp said i think 6 billion would 
be too high 1 billion would be too low 
we are getting a handle on this kemp said tuesday we have 
stopped the hemorrhaging 
late tuesday rep tom lantos dcalif introduced a bill that 
he said could save hud some 390 million by having the agency 
refinance subsidized mortgages to get lower interest rates 
kemp made clear he held his predecessors responsible for the mess 
he found although he did not mention former housing secretary 
samuel pierce jr or former president ronald reagan by name 
frankly any administration has to be held accountable and is 
accountable to the american people and to the pages of the history 
books for how programs are run during their stewardship kemp 
said i think that speaks volumes about previous administrations 
plural 
the justice department is investigating the theft of as much as 
20 million by private closing agents who sold hud property and kept 
the money and other investigations are focusing on loan programs in 
which questionable deals were made leading to high default rates 
kemp who was a congressman from new york before being appointed 
hud secretary by president bush got a warm reception from his 
former house colleagues who were just as eager to praise his 
efforts to clean up the department as they were to blame his 
predecessors for fouling it up 
as they groped for ways to express themselves the metaphors got 
thick 
lantos referred to kemps former career in the american football 
league calling him the quarterback at hud who has been 
blitzed by the scandals but nevertheless is not one to punt 
rep marge roukema rnj called hud humpty dumpty 
although she said she thought it could be put back together again 
schumer called hud a swamp and housing in the united states a 
desert then praised kemp for fixing the leaky hose at the 
department 
kemp who first called hud a swamp a few months ago had enough 
im sorry the swamp thing ever got used he said

state james a baker iii announced today 
this is nearly two months ahead of schedule and improves 
prospects for completing an accord within a year baker told 
reporters traveling with president bush here 
by tabling this proposal we are taking a step toward ending 
the military division of europe baker said at a news conference 
baker praised the soviets for accepting a us proposal to 
conduct trial monitoring of nuclear missile systems before signing a 
strategic weapons treaty 
we think it is very good that the soviets have responded 
positively baker said 
despite complaints by american anlysts outside the government 
that it was a stalling tactic baker said trial monitoring might 
move arms control forward instead of retarding it 
the negotiations to cut longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines are being held in geneva the talks to reduce troops and 
other nonnuclear forces are scheduled to recess on thursday in 
vienna 
the next round is scheduled for sept 5 
putting natos proposal on the table before the recess gives the 
soviets and their allies nearly two months to frame a response 
baker announced meanwhile that nato would propose a ceiling of 
5700 combat aircraft for each alliance and 1900 combat helicopters 
the decision to make the proposal on thursday was reached by a a 
panel of senior nato officials in brussels last friday a us 
official said 
bush first unveiled at the nato summit in may his blueprint for 
deep reductions in conventional arms and troops in europe by the 
superpowers it was subsequently endorsed by the full nato alliance

china wooed 400 foreign travel agents wednesday 
with wine and words of friendship as it tried to persuade them to 
bring back lucrative tours that were canceled when martial law was 
imposed in beijing 
the chinese people will not forget those friends who help us in 
difficulty bo xicheng director of the beijing tourism 
administration declared at the start of a twoday seminar 
the travel agents were reassured by the calm on the streets but 
said the immediate outlook is poor 
these soldiers have their fingers on the triggers gloria 
copeland of trinity travel in toronto said of troops standing guard 
on city streets theyre going to have to sling the guns behind 
their backs before tourists come back 
people in america take one good vacation a year and this 
year theyre going to europe said joe openshaw of sunco travel in 
walnut creek calif he said lifting martial law would help 
chinas prospects 
bo said however that were not going to lift martial law just 
because a few tourists wont come to china 
authorities have refused to say how long martial law will last 
keeping an estimated 150000 soldiers on the streets and in barracks 
on the capitals outskirts 
tourists and foreign residents fled by the thousands when chinas 
army fought its way into beijing on june 34 firing on student 
prodemocracy protesters and bystanders 
luxury hotels emptied except for staff and gift shop clerks 
napped behind their counters as chinas tourism industry which made 
22 billion last year faced major losses 
two weeks ago bos office sent invitations to foreign tour 
agents it knew invited them to bring others then flew them for 
free and put them up in luxury hotels in a lastditch effort to save 
the season 
zhou dayan a spokeswoman for the tourism administration said 
the conferences mission was urgent maybe in the second half of 
the year we can draw some tourists she said 
bo recounted the governments explanation that the army crackdown 
was necessary but his main theme was the money being lost on both 
sides 
perhaps we have different views and understandings of some 
problems but this does not prevent us from doing business on an 
equal and mutually beneficial basis he told the agents before 
they were taken to tiananmen square formerly the heart of the 
protests 
that trip may have backfired as the travel agents noticed 
lingering evidence of the violence that accompanied the crackdown 
i saw the scars on the concrete from the tank tracks and it 
reminded me of what id seen on television a month ago frankly it 
was depressing said an american who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
not all responses were negative several agents said they had 
canceled june and july tours but planned to send groups in august 
and september despite continued warnings from foreign governments 
including the united states against travel to china 
i think the situation may be better than most of us thought it 
would be ms copeland said the airport was fine the hotel was 
fine the only problem we had was when we were on the street and saw 
the soldiers and wondered if we would be stopped 
she said diehard types likely will visit this year but 
thats not the bulk of the tourists many are middleamerica types 
and they need a bit more time they will come back but theyre 
probably going to say do it next year

police raided shanghai bars last week in a 
crackdown on prostitution in the citys night spots newspapers 
reported 
shanghai recently established a cultural management bureau to 
oversee the citys flourishing cultural market of bars discos 
tea houses orchestras art groups and fashion shows the guangming 
daily reported wednesday 
regulations imposed by the bureau include a relicensing of all 
bands and a ban on bar girls

famous for its nightlife which in recent years began to flourish 
again

shanghai has 667 dance halls tea houses and japanesestyle bars 
288 bands 1500 musicians and 450 singers 
during a threeday investigation last week authorities visited 
87 bars in four districts closed five of them suspended the 
license of two and arrested 22 bar girls shanghais wen hui bao 
reported sunday 
the liberation daily another shanghai newspaper gave a detailed 
account of the midnight bar raid in its tuesday editions 
this was just a small shop with an aisle going down the 
middle and dining cartype chairs on the sides using the light 
from the television one could see three pretty and coquettishly 
made up girls one of whom was small and skinny and looked about 15 
years old the report said

us trade representative carla hills said 
wednesday that the united states has proposed a technical measure 
designed to speed the reduction of barriers to trade in farm 
products 
hills said the bush administration wants other nations to convert 
nontariff import barriers such as quotas and restrictive licenses 
to tariffs 
by converting to tariffs barriers would be more transparent 
and uniform making it easier to negotiate worldwide reductions in 
agriculture support and protection she said in a statement 
the proposal was made in geneva in trade negotiations with 100 
other nations under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade gatt which regulates world trade treaties and settles 
commerce disputes the current series of talks known as the uruguay 
round began in 1986 and are scheduled to run through next year 
in april gatt negotiators achieved a breakthrough in the talks 
which had been deadlocked since december reaching broad agreement 
in four key areas including a compromise on a us demand to do 
away with all tradedistorting agricultural subsidies the talks 
since then have been aimed at nailing down specifics of how to 
achieve the goals of the larger compromise 
hills said the us tarification proposal must be part of a 
more comprehensive package including fundamental refors in domestic 
farm subsidies export subsidies and sanitary rules

high infant mortality and dropout rates among 
blacks are problems all america must work to overcome vice 
president dan quayle told the naacp convention today 
quayle spoke on the fourth day of the national association for 
the advancement of colored peoples annual convention in detroit 
if president george bush were in the country you know he would 
be speaking to you quayle said bush was in hungary today as part 
of his tour of eastern europe 
quayle said the bush administration was committed to promoting 
civil rights and the president had met several times with civil 
rights leaders he reviewed the history of the civil rights 
movement including the removal of governmentsanctioned racial 
segregation 
now thanks to much of the work by the naacp these racial 
barriers have been struck down but as the slogan says the struggle 
continues he said today there is less bigotry than before 
but there is still bigotry and bigots 
quayle cited statistics indicating the social and economic 
disadvantage of blacks 
let us not forget that the black infant mortality rate is twice 
as high as for whites said quayle who also spoke of the 
disproportionately high dropout rate among young blacks 
these are not just black problems these are americas 
problems quayle said 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks as he had done two days 
before for secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp 
gave a warm introduction to a member of the bush administration 
when vice president quayle was a senator he did vote to make 
martin luther king day a holiday hooks said he was one of the 
few republicans who voted to override president reagans veto of 
south african sanctions 
on tuesday chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca and hooks 
announced the company was pledging to boost opportunities for 
minorities and women in salaried positions 
the fair share pledge commits the no 3 automaker to doubling 
the number of women and minorities in management roles to 20 
percent said anthony st john chryslers vice president for human 
resources 
chrysler became the nations 62nd company and the last of the big 
three automakers to join the program 
generally companies signing the agreement make commitments to 
expand access of blacks to entry and midlevel jobs increase the 
number of blackowned suppliers and appoint blacks to boards of 
directors 
the program also calls on chrysler to increase the number of 
blackowned dealerships which currently number 72 of about 5300 
but iacocca said increasing that would be more difficult than 
putting more blacks in management ranks because you dont become 
an entrepreneur just by raising you hand and saying id like to be 
an entrepreneur 
st john also said the company expects to maintain its 23percent 
level of minority hourly workers during the next five years 
earlier tuesday detroit mayor coleman young told the conference 
that blacks who want to help the inner cities should stop spending 
money with retailers that move out to the suburbs 
we have to learn to spend our money with our own and in our 
own city he said 
michigan gov james blanchard praised a speech monday by housing 
secretary jack kemp calling for major efforts to upgrade urban 
neighborhoods but said his words must be matched by action 
i understand secretary kemp gave a stirring speech here but 
the key will be whether jack can deliver the reaganbush 
administration behind what he wants to do said blanchard a 
democrat

prosecutors have decided to retry a 
retarded man whose death sentence for a murder and rape was struck 
down last month by the us supreme court 
without a retrial the state would have to commute johnny penrys 
sentence to life imprisonment 
penry 33 was sentenced to death in 1980 for the slaying of 
pamela carpenter the 22yearold sister of former washington 
redskins kicker mark moseley 
the sentence was vacated by the high court which said jurors at 
penrys trial should have been instructed that his history of mental 
impairment and child abuse might have warranted life in prison 
instead 
but the court disagreed with penrys lawyers that it is 
unconstitutional to execute the mentally retarded 
penrys iq is estimated at between 50 and 60 and experts say he 
has the reasoning ability of a 7yearold 
district attorney terry brown said tuesday he hopes to have the 
case back in the courtroom by fall although questions over the 
location of the trial the admission of a 10yearold confession and 
other issues could delay matters 
brown said he is convinced the verdict and sentence will be the 
same as before 
youre always concerned when youre dealing with this kind of 
time lag for instance i know of at least two witnesses who have 
died since including one of the arresting officers and penrys 
mother brown said 
but if i didnt think wed be able to obtain a death penalty in 
retrial i wouldnt have decided to retry the case 
curtis mason a texas department of corrections staff attorney 
who represented the former laborer in his supreme court appeal said 
brown wants a retrial for political reasons

the mother a 6weekold girl whose 
smothered body was found in a garbage can pleaded innocent today to 
murder in a case nearly identical to the death of the womans older 
child three years ago 
paula sims 30 was indicted tuesday by a madison county grand 
jury that still was weighing whether to charge her husband robert 
sims 37 in the slaying of their daughter heather said states 
attorney william haine 
wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and shackles mrs sims entered 
the courtroom of judge edward ferguson to hear the charges against 
her and have a written plea entered by attorney donald groshong 
a formal arraignment probably will be scheduled for next week 
said the judge who refused a motion that bond be set mrs sims is 
being held in madison county jail 
she faces the death penalty if convicted 
neither prosecutors nor groshong made any statement in court 
today 
the nude body of heather sims was found may 3 in a trash can 
across the mississippi river from the familys alton home four days 
after mrs sims reported that a masked gunman had abducted the girl 
it was an almost identical story she gave police three years 
earlier when her first daughter loralei disappeared 13 days after 
her birth in 1986 skeletal remains believed to be loraleis were 
found a few days later about 150 yards from the simses home in 
rural brighton in jersey county 
that death remains unsolved 
alton detective jody oguinn arrested mrs sims at her parents 
home in cottage hills shortly after the indictment was returned and 
led her away in handcuffs 
the grand jury heard more than four hours of testimony from her 
parents tuesday before returning the indictment they were ordered 
to testify after being granted immunity 
but the prosecutor said other evidence made the states case 
the physical evidence was very important haine said but he did 
not elaborate 
defense attorney groshong refused to comment 
but herb condray mrs sims brotherinlaw said police are only 
trying to save face by arresting her 
i think the police have egg on their face so bad that they 
would do anything condray said 
the simses also have a 17month old son randy who was placed 
into the custody of the illinois department of children and family 
services during the investigation of heathers death 
before the indictment mrs sims had been charged in jersey and 
madison counties with obstruction of justice and concealment of a 
homicide in connection with her daughters deaths 
she was free on 350000 bond on those charges 
jersey county sheriff frank yocom said the investigation into 
loraleis death continues but is difficult because the cause of 
death was never established 
the autopsy on heather revealed she had been suffocated with a 
hand over her mouth the body had freezer burns leading 
investigators to conclude that she had been put in a freezer before 
the body was dumped in the trash 
mrs sims was indicted on two counts of murdering heather 
the first count alleges that mrs sims intended to kill the girl 
the second count alleges mrs sims committed an act she knew had the 
strong probability of ending in death or great bodily harm

willie b zoo atlantas bachelor gorilla who 
spent nearly all of his life alone in a cage had his first outdoor 
romp with his new female companions today but preferred chewing a 
bamboo stalk to courtship 
zoo officials who hope to breed willie b said they werent 
surprised that romance didnt bloom immediately 
whether he will reproduce is still an open question said zoo 
director terry maple 
willie b came bounding out into his new naturalstyle habitat at 
about 9 am but spent most of the next hour or so snacking or 
mugging for a gaggle of photographers 
today is the first day in the rest of willie bs life as a 
social animal maple said 
sam winslow curator of mammals at the zoo said the chances of 
willie b mating are a long shot because he has been isolated in 
captivity so long 
he said zoo officials around the world cooperate in keeping 
breeding records and exchanging animals to keep an active gene pool 
going among the captive population and to avoid inbreeding 
he said it is most likely willie b would breed with the younger 
of his two companions kinyani age 6 who is just approaching 
maturity willie b is thought to be 31 
he had been introduced to female gorillas gradually over recent 
months and will be with them outdoors routinely from now on 
kinyani approached willie b briefly in their first few minutes 
outside together but scampered off a few yards which animal 
behaviorists said is normal 
the females are on loan from the yerkes regional primate research 
center of emory university willie b was caged from the time of his 
capture as an infant until his new outdoor habitat was completed a 
year ago

open the global market to more hungarians

peace corps

without a hint of remorse jerry adam 
stepped into the pristine hercules glade wilderness in the mark 
twain national forest and set a fire that blackened 1000 acres 
no one rushed to arrest him no smokejumpers parachuted in to 
fight the flames adam is a fire technician with the us forest 
service 
we do prescribed burns in the glade areas to reduce the amount 
of fuel that could lead to a major fire said forest service 
spokesman dave wester in other cases its done to provide a 
certain kind of habitat for wildlife we sometimes burn grazing land 
if it is seeded with warm season grasses since fire is part of the 
management of those grasses occasionally well burn to prepare a 
site for tree planting 
prescribed burning was conducted this spring on about 6000 acres 
in the 15millionacre mark twain national forest in southern 
missouri wester said the closely monitored burns are done just 
before trees and grasses turn green 
camping hiking and horseback riding are popular in the remote 
region classified by the government as having the cleanest air in 
the state the glades a unique combination of open grasslands 
featuring prairie vegetation shallow soil rocky outcroppings 
steep hillsides and forested knobs are also prized for dogwood 
blooms in the spring and outstanding fall foilage 
prescribed burning is necessary every three to five years in the 
glades adam said 
if it isnt done youll have a fuel buildup and the potential 
for a catastrophic fire which is what they had at yellowstone last 
year in which almost all living trees are killed and the soil is 
exposed and sterilized he said 
fire also keeps the spread of trees in check and gets rid of dead 
material that can choke young plants 
fire is also important to animals that live in the open glade 
landscape 
theres a couple of little critters that really depend on these 
glades such as the collared lizard and the roadrunner which is 
more common to the arid southwest adam said we have armadillos 
here too 
in missouri the rare bachman sparrow nests only in the hercules 
wilderness glade 
ash from the fires also rejuvenates dozens of varieties of 
wildflowers fire is just like giving them a shot of fertilizer 
adam said 
periodic fires once occurred naturally in the glades started by 
lightning or perhaps by indians adam said but when europeans moved 
in they put out the natural fires and built roads which acted as 
firebreaks 
it took a forest service crew using torches dripping a 
combination of diesel fuel and gasoline just five hours on a cool 
day in early april to burn the leafy groundcover off 1000 acres in 
the hercules glade wilderness 
today few signs remain of the fire dense green prairie grasses 
and wildflowers are abundant the fire burned to a height of about 
three or four feet blackening the bark of tall hardy oak and pine 
trees but otherwise not harming them 
adam doubts that any animals died in the fire 
a turtle will scoot under those leaves for safety and the fire 
will run right over him he said as soon as the fire passes by 
and cools down youll see all these little lizards come out of 
their holes of course the bigger animals like deer and turkey 
just move out

heavy rain overnight helped firefighters get the upper hand on a 
wildfire that destroyed 37 homes in boulder canyon colo the most 
destructive of the many wildfires burning today in eight states 
but fire bosses worried that storms in several of the burned 
areas could also bring lightning and the potential for new blazes 
twenty fires were burning on more than 110000 acres in eight 
states arizona california colorado montana nebraska new 
mexico nevada and utah according to the federal boise interagency 
fire center in idaho 
rain helped the 11000 firefighters working on the lines but 
officials issued a red flag warning because of thunderstorms 
that are expected to move from northern arizona across nevada the 
sierra nevada range of california eastern oregon idaho and montana 
in the next two days 
officials at the firefighting coordinating agency fear the storms 
could add to the more than 70000 lightning strikes recorded across 
the west during the past week mostly in the past two days 
its a mixed blessing the chance of rain versus the chance 
of lightning jerry larson deputy nebraska fire marshal said 
today 
half an inch of rain poured on the boulder canyon fire overnight 
helping about 180 firefighters get the 2000acre blaze 90 percent 
contained said us forest service spokeswoman melissa carlson in 
boulder 
the fire which broke out sunday razed 37 homes and damaged 
numerous other structures on private property 
more rain was expected today and firefighters hoped to contain 
the blaze inside a ring of bare earth this evening 
boulder county sheriff brad leach said the blaze began with 
carelessly discarded smoking material near a trailer owned by 
mitch steiner of boulder but that there was insufficient evidence 
for charges 
in an interview broadcast tuesday on kcnctv in denver steiner 
28 said he went to the trailer for a few minutes sunday to pick up 
tools but said he was sure he hadnt smoked or dropped anything 
burning 
the federal firefighting center gave the boulder canyon blaze the 
highest priority because of the damage to property and the threat it 
posed to inhabited areas 
residents were allowed back into the area but the sheriffs 
office was advising people against staying overnight 
in arizona a firefighter was struck dead by lightning on monday 
becoming the second fatality of the fire season a firefighter in 
california was killed by a falling tree on sunday 
rain helped crews contain or control nearly all the fires that 
burned 50000 acres in southern arizona officials also expected to 
bring under control today a 1700acre blaze near the grand canyons 
north rim tourist lodge which had threatened a historic hunting 
cabin used by president theodore roosevelt said wendell peacock of 
the us bureau of land management 
several other fires were burning out of control in central and 
northern arizona including an 800acre blaze that threatened the 
havasu national wildlife refuge which is home to nesting bald 
eagles and a 500acre fire in the tonto national forest 
the nations biggest fire was in northwestern nebraska where 
planes dumped fireretardant chemicals on a blaze that burned 
between 50000 and 100000 acres on ranchland and in fort robinson 
state park where sioux chief crazy horse was killed 
firefighters used heavy equipment and shovels to dig a line of 
bare earth around the burning area said larson the deputy fire 
marshal the blaze was declared fully contained late this morning 
the fire is now well within the established fire line the 
weather is cooperating the winds have died down larson said 
we are cautiously optimistic that the worst part of the fire is 
over gov kay orr said on a tour of the burned area tuesday 
officials planned to open the park friday the fire was ignited 
by lightning saturday 
nine people have been treated at a hospital for minor injuries 
since the blaze began larson said 
elsewhere 
good weather helped firefighters encircle two brush fires in 
northern california that burned more than 8000 acres but tough 
going was reported today in the battle against a blaze at big sur on 
the coast the big sur fire believed to be arson charred nearly 
3000 acres of growth and firefighters hoped to contain it by 6 
pm today said us forest service spokesman maeton freel 
at mesa verde national park in southwestern colorado the us 
forest service decided today to reopen all but a few sections to the

increased concern about violent crime is 
producing an unlikely congressional coalition behind a plan to add 
100000 officers to police forces across the country by trading 
scholarships for service 
the idea behind the police corps act of 1989 is to boost the 
strength of state and local police forces by up to 22 percent while 
creating a new brand of collegeeducated officers to cope with 
racial tensions gang warfare and other special challenges 
an unusual group of lawmakers has formed around the bill 
including reps barney frank dmass and bob dornan rcalif 
the outspoken liberal frank is rarely on the same side of an 
issue with dornan an equally combative conservative people who 
disagree on 90 percent of the issues agree on 10 percent frank 
said tuesday 
frank said he backs the measure because its a good idea to 
have collegeeducated people in law enforcement we dont pay cops 
enough and dont give people enough incentive to be cops 
participating students would get federally guaranteed loans for 
their education then have up to 40000 repaid by the government 
once they complete four years in the state police or a local police 
department in the sponsoring state 
the idea was developed in part by adam walinsky a new york city 
lawyer and former chairman of the state investigations commission 
there after seven years of lobbying he believes the time is ripe 
for congressional action 
this years version was introduced today by sens arlen specter 
rpa and jim sasser dtenn 
sasser said at a news conference that he will also include 
language in a district of columbia spending bill creating a police 
corps pilot program in the nations capital he said the senate 
government affairs committee is scheduled to consider the bill later 
this week 
the test program would provide 50 students with scholarships in 
exchange for commitments to serve in the citys police force for 
four years 
washington dc has become a paradigm of the nations growing 
problem with violent crime sasser said it will provide a 
rigorous test for the police corps concept 
while the government would pay for the scholarships it would 
still be up to municipalities to pay the salaries of the additional 
officers but specter said the officers would be premium 
applicants and would be cheaper than others to employ because they 
would not likely participate in pension programs as early 
cost is one reason why the plan has taken since 1982 to gain 
momentum on capitol hill 
its taken unbelievably long walinsky said if we had been 
able to add the number and quality of police officers that this 
intended we wouldnt be in quite the trouble we are today but that 
was then and this is now 
backers point to alreadystretched local law enforcement budgets 
and to statistics showing that the nation allocates to violent crime 
just onesixth of the police power compared with 30 years ago 
we have an historic precedent said specter the former 
district attorney of philadelphia in times of national emergency 
the bulk of our military officers have been drawn not from the 
career forces but from the citizenry at large they have been 
volunteers who after their tour of duty returned to their civilian 
occupations 
police officials acknowledge there may be concerns about elitism 
but the measure has gained the support of the national association 
of police organizations which represents 90000 rankandfile 
officers 
if you look at the district of columbia for example you know 
there is a problem recruiting said jules bernstein the 
organizations legislative counsel the job of being a police 
officer is extremely hazardous we support the bill 
don cahill legislative director of the national fraternal order 
of police which also backs the bill said the measure would 
really bring up the level of professionalism 
the problem i do see is that its going to cost a heck of a lot 
of money he said 
walinsky said the bill envisions adding 100000 officers to the 
480000 on the job today if each accepted the maximum of 40000 
that would create a 4 billion price tag 
the justice department has yet to take a position on the measure 
said spokesman david runkel 
other senate sponsors include joseph lieberman dconn the 
former state attorney general warren rudman rnh bill bradley 
dnj chris dodd dconn trent lott rmiss and harry reid 
dnev

they all represent the same state and 
theyre all members of the same legislature but theres a big 
difference between members of new jerseys senate and assembly it 
has to do with their appetites 
during two nightlong sessions last month to produce a new 
budget the 80 members of the assembly chowed down on takeout pizza 
and meatball sandwiches 
it cost 40028 for the two nights said bradley brewster 
executive director of the assembly republican majority this is 
standard fare for late nights it was pretty austere 
senators however were allowed 25 for dinner each day or a 
maximum of 2000 for the 40 lawmakers said a senate spokesman the 
bills are still coming in but the senators apparently spent a 
little less than their limit he said 
the senators also could have used one of several rooms reserved 
at a marriott hotel although only one or two senators did the 
spokesman said 
no rooms were set aside for assembly members said majority 
leader garabed haytaian 
we only called up and ordered pizzas he said we are not

a flock of ducks skipped town before they 
could be evicted from the wet n wild amusement park for taking free 
rides and begging for food 
the ducks were known for crashing the lazy river ride and the 
water slides riding along with paying guests 
an eighthour effort to capture the birds last week left wouldbe 
captors with only one bird in hand while about 30 of the mallards 
still enjoyed their freedom 
a second roundup was planned tuesday but park officials sent 
word that the ducks had checked out 
it seems that all the commotion has frightened them away 
said carmen shaw an environmentalist who led the relocation attempt 
general manager richard faber received hundreds of suggestions 
for getting rid of the birds several saying the ducks could be 
moved if they were fed bread doused with liquor 
that was a bit extreme he said we have some juvenile 
ducks floating out there

prominent white south african writers 
including novelist andre brink and poet breyten breytenbach met 
guerrilla leaders and backed an academic and cultural boycott of 
their nation they said wednesday 
the writers announced their support following a fourday meeting 
of 45 writers and guerrilla leaders of the african national congress 
at the northwestern zimbabwe resort of victoria falls anc delegates 
were led by sculptor barbara masikela head of the movements arts 
and culture department 
writers said they support international isolation of the 
government and called for the strengthening simultaneously of all 
forms of progressive south african culture 
the united nations keeps a blacklist to monitor its ban on 
cultural and academic ties recently for example the musical group 
the commodores was persuaded to cancel a planned tour of south 
africa when it was threatened with a spot on the blacklist 
the writers mostly afrikaans speakers called for their language 
to be freed from its racist connotations so that it could find 
its place in the cultural identity of a united nonracial 
democratic south africa 
afrikaans is a language derived from south africas dutch 
settlers dutch descendants dominate the government and in the 
past enforced teaching of afrikaans in black schools has led to 
widespread unrest 
the writers deplored the way in which our culture is 
impovershed by our enforced separation 
it is not heroic to oppose apartheid it is normal their 
statement said 
the talks which were organized by the institute for a democratic 
alternative in south africa and ended tuesday were the latest in a 
series of meetings between white opponents of the pretoria 
government and the anc which is outlawed in south africa

syrian and christian forces battled with 
howitzers around beirut amid heightening tension over a wednesday 
report the christians expect a new shipment of frog7 missiles 
police said 10 people were wounded in the duel between gunners 
from the syrian army and mainly christian lebanese army across a 
mountain range southeast of the capital 
the wounded are four christian soldiers two christian civilians 
and four moslem civilians police said 
since the latest round of the civil war began march 8 over 
christian leader gen michel aouns blockade of illegal ports run by 
syrianbacked militias 405 people have been killed and 1593 have 
been wounded 
smoke billowed from the wooded slopes overlooking beirut as 
shells thudded across the valleys wednesday morning a police 
spokesman said they exploded at a rate of six a minute the shelling 
subsided into intermittent exchanges around noon 
the barrage coincided with the arrival in damascus of the 
moroccan algerian and saudi foreign ministers to discuss a truce 
with syrian president hafez assad 
in spite of the difficulties i still think that conditions are 
appropriate for brotherly arabsponsored solutions moroccan 
foreign minister abdel latif alfilali said in damascus 
the three are on an arab league mission to negotiate a settlement 
to lebanons 14year civil war by november lebanese media said 
their efforts face failure 
the official syrian arab news agency said they gave assad letters 
from king hassan of morocco algerian president chedli bendjedid and 
saudi king fahd 
a commentary by radio damascus reaffirmed syrias committment to 
the peace moves saying extracting lebanon from its crisis is a 
national task in which the arab league mission should persevere 
and continue 
syria considers lebanon within its sphere of influence and has 
40000 troops stationed across the country under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate six syrian gunboats are blockading a 28mile 
coastal stretch east of beirut controlled by christians 
beiruts conservative daily addiyar quoted unidentified 
christian sources as predicting a major escalation of 
hostilities by the weekend if the arab league envoys fail to 
persuade syria to lift the blockade 
addiyar said syrias navy is waiting to intercept a large 
iraqi ship carrying more than 15 gazelle helicopter gunships in 
addition to airtosurface missiles and bombs for aouns forces 
it said another iraqi vessel is carrying sovietmade frog7 
surfacetosurface missiles for aoun 
syria sent its navy to block the coast last week after it said 
aoun had received an undisclosed number of frog7 missiles and 
demanded they be removed because they can hit damascus 
at least seven reportedly are deployed in the christian enclave 
if fired from the easternmost flank of christianheld mountains 
they could reach damascus 40 miles away 
aoun refuses to say whether he has any of the missiles and 
reportedly has threatened air strikes against the syrian gunboats 
on tuesday aoun sent a lone jet fighter roaring low over syrian 
batteries in west beirut the aging warplane is one of aouns three 
operational britishmade hawker hunters that with eight gazelles 
make up his air force 
assafir a leftist daily newspaper close to the syrian 
government said aoun plans a major escalation of the 
confrontation in the next few days with the aim of achieving a 
meeting of the united nations security council on lebanon 
the paper quoted unidentified western sources as saying france 
and iraq support aouns bid to force a discussion at the world body 
iraq syrias main arab rival has declared support for aouns 
war of liberation to drive syria out of lebanon because its 
troops have betrayed their mandate by siding with the moslems 
syria and its local moslem and leftist militia allies in lebanon 
command 80000 troops that far outnumber aouns army of 20000

karl marx university where president 
bush on wednesday praised hungarian moves toward a freemarket 
economy no longer requires that students read das kapital 
indeed as bush spoke the statue of marx was out of sight hidden 
by a press platform 
history has proved that a freemarket economy provides a much 
higher living standard said magdolna sass 24 one of the 
thousands of hungarians who reacted enthusiastically when bush 
proclaimed that the iron curtain is parting and that your great 
country is leading the way 
at the rear of the glasscovered courtyard where bush spoke was 
the halls lifesize statue of a seated marx the brow was furrowed 
the eyes pressed deep in thought the right hand reaching upward in 
a type of clawing motion seemingly trying to keep its grasp on 
this country of 10 million 
but few saw the statue of the godfather of communism towering 
over it was a press platform crowded with reporters and 
photographers covering the first visit ever by an american president 
to hungary 
zsuzsanna szabo like ms sass a recent graduate of the 
university said she found bushs speech very important 
there certainly are steps that must be taken to improve our 
economy she told a reporter 
long rounds of applause greeted bush who was given an 
enthusiastic standing ovation when he finished 
at one point the president praised hungarys willingness to 
break with the past and asked his audience 
what better example of this could there be than one simple fact 
karl marx university has dropped das kapital from its required 
reading list 
the 19thcentury german genius monumental work along with his 
other writings formed the basis for the communist systems that have 
spread around the globe 
yet despite the students growing interest in capitalist 
proponents from adam smith onward both graduates agree that hungary 
will not completely turn its back on marx any time soon 
that would only be possible when the old guard politicians die 
off ms sass said 
everyone now says hes in favor of reforms ms szabo said of 
the schools students but id say only about 70 percent of them 
really believe in a freemarket economy 
bushs procapitalism speech was not the first irony visited on 
the karl marx university of economic sciences since its founding in 
1951 
the president of the 3700student school csaba csaky said in a 
recent interview that his institution had been the cradle of the 
reform process that began moving hungarys economy away from 
strict marxismleninism two decades ago 
imre nagy the reformist premier abducted by soviet forces during 
the 1956 revolt and later executed once taught agricultural 
economics at the university 
and just four months ago the very hall in which bush spoke was 
the site of the founding congress of the hungarian democratic forum 
one of the new opposition groups planning for the nations first 
open elections next year 
what would marx think of such activities in an institution that 
bears his name 
graduate sandor katona asked about bushs pep talk for 
capitalism said with a smile 
marx was a philosopher he would have sat and listened

embattled leaders of new private businesses 
protested wednesday they are being strangled by oppressive taxes and 
bureaucrats who portray them as greedy swindlers 
officers of the new alliance of united cooperatives told a news 
conference they were alarmed by signs of swelling anticooperative 
sentiment from the populace the staterun media and even president 
mikhail s gorbachev whose reforms gave rise to the privately run 
businesses 
on july 1 some localities in the ukraine and byelorussia began 
taxing revenues rather than profits at rates as high as 50 percent 
said vladimir tikhonov president of the alliance 
there is an intentional direction toward strangling the 
cooperative movement tikhonov said the alliance is pressing for 
a maximum tax of 20 percent on profits rather than revenues 
the small businesses which usually share their profits among 
several owners are virtually the only visible success in the 
economic reform more than 100000 have sprung up in just 2 years 
and they have created 2 million jobs in an otherwise stagnant 
economy 
although gorbachev praised the coops jan 1 he gave them only 
lukewarm support tuesday in a meeting with leningrad residents in 
response to their complaints that cooperatives charge exorbitant 
prices for poorquality goods he said local authorities can 
regulate their activity 
tikhonov said gorbachevs statement was disturbing and not 
thought through 
it implied that were giving you the right to tax 
cooperatives and if theyre stifling you with their prices you can 
stifle them with taxes he said 
an article in wednesdays edition of the communist party 
newspaper pravda that was headlined crazy money slammed 
cooperatives for hogging bank loan funds fueling corruption 
laundering money and charging unjustified high prices 
pravda said it was in favor of cooperatives but against dirty 
wheelerdealers 
speakers at the news conference said if the cooperatives fail 
the sluggish economy already plagued by shortages will slip even 
further into crisis 
it is my conviction there can be no economic reform without 
intensive development of the cooperative sector tikhonov said 
tikhonov said bureacratic opposition to the cooperatives 
including stereotypes cultivated by staterun media is intensifying 
as government ministries try to fight competition from the private 
sector 
but in an apparently conciliatory move tikhonov said the 
cooperatives alliance is seeking a dialogue with the government 
and the businesses hope to win more orders from state firms the 
news conference was held in the foreign ministry press center an 
indication of a certain amount of government support 
although the general law on cooperatives encourages their 
development thousands of lesser directives and decrees issued in 
bureacratic forays on the upstart businesses threaten their 
existence speakers said wednesday 
for example one health ministry decree forbade cooperative 
medical clinics from renting state diagnostic equipment said yuri 
vorontsov head of a medical cooperative 
the cooperative alliance is seeking repeal of all directives 
limiting cooperative activities now we are a united force that 
can stand against those decrees said artyom tarasov head of the 
cooperative tekhnika and depicted by the soviet press as a 
millionaire 
tikhonov said if the restrictions on cooperatives are not 
canceled many cooperatives will collapse theyll fall apart 
hurting not only their employees but also the state enterprises that 
have contracts with them

a delegation of american mental health experts 
who visited the soviet union said wednesday that more reforms are 
needed to prevent hospitalization of dissidents and other citizens 
who arent mentally ill 
the recommendation was one of several the group made to protect 
people against abuse by soviet psychiatric institutions 
the soviets disagreed with some aspects of the study but 
nonetheless called it a valuable and useful document 
the official 26member delegation was invited to visit the soviet 
union from feb 26 to march 12 to assess recent changes in soviet 
psychiatry they examined 15 patients and 12 former patients who had 
been released within the preceding two years 
the visit came amid allegations of psychiatric abuses in the 
soviet union one report had cited 346 cases of alleged abuse 
between 1977 and 1983 
but the american delegation said there had been progress in 
recent years toward establishing some legal protection for patients 
subject to forced confinement 
in its 117page report the delegation said broad concepts of 
social dangerousness have contributed to the soviet practice of 
hospitalizing people who arent mentally ill 
for this and other reasons the delegation recommends that 
additional steps be taken to revise the soviet criminal codes to 
remove all prohibitions against expression of political or religious 
beliefs it said 
in addition the report said new legislation or regulations 
appear necessary to limit involuntary hospitalizations solely to 
those who are a direct danger to themselves or others 
the report recommended increased use of defense lawyers to guard 
against patient abuse and the institutionalization of periodic 
reviews to ensure that hospital stays are not excessively long 
according to the report the soviets generally complied with the 
terms of the agreement under which the visit was made although 
there were some significant procedural obstacles that made 
completion more difficult 
the preliminary soviet response acknowledged the existence of 
such obstacles but said that problem by no means meant that the 
soviet specialists artificially created difficulties and tried to 
limit access to the necessary information on the patients 
as for the allegation by the us team that mental patients have 
insufficient legal protections the soviets said efforts were being 
made to conform soviet legislation to international standards 
in addition the soviets said there has been discussion about 
creating an independent commission to examine complaints and monitor 
institutions 
the soviet ministry of foreign affairs has been interested in 
inviting foreign psychiatrists to visit as part of growing soviet 
interest in improving international perception of its humanrights 
policy

children should be kept from large buckets 
especially containers that have been converted to household use 
because of the possibility of drowning the consumer product safety 
commission said wednesday 
at least 67 children most 8 to 12monthsold drowned in 
buckets from 198587 the commission said 
most drowned in 5gallon containers including those originally 
designed for bulk products such as paint food and spackling 
compound 
the 5gallon bucket is particularly dangerous because its 
heavier weight makes it more stable than a smaller bucket and 
unlikely to tip over when a child uses it to pull up the 
commission said 
the commission said the cook county ill medical examiners 
office first reported the hazard the office said all 11 bucket 
drownings it has investigated since 1985 involved 5gallon shipping 
containers being used as household buckets

a reputed cocaine dealer and two former 
bodyguards of hustler publisher larry flynt were ordered to 
stand trial today in the 6yearold cotton club murder of 
theatrical producer roy radin 
municipal judge patti jo mckay who heard two months of testimony 
about the hollywoodrelated killing said there was sufficient 
evidence presented to support convictions of the defendants at a 
trial 
it appears to me the offenses have been committed and there 
is sufficient reason to find the defendants guilty she said 
they are held to answer 
the judge also eliminated one special circumstance but allowed 
two others to stand making the defendants eligible for the death 
penalty if convicted at a trial 
its what we expected said deputy district attorney sally 
thomas 
the defendants karen delayne lanie greenberger alex marti 
and william mentzer were impassive as they stood to hear the judge 
render her ruling 
moments before the decision deputy district attorney david conn 
had argued that mrs greenberger ordered the killing of radin 
because she perceived him as a threat to her business relationship 
with producer robert evans 
conn said mrs greenberger was determined to get radin out of the 
way so she could continue a lucrative deal with evans to finance the 
movie the cotton club the story of a harlem nightclub starring 
richard gere 
mr radin was an obstacle to further negotiations on the 
cotton club deal conn said mrs greenberger had a motive to 
murder mr radin to remove him from the deal she knew that mr 
evans wanted and desired her to have a greater share in the deal 
than mr radin wanted her to have 
in addition he said mrs greenberger blamed radin for a theft of 
drugs and cash from her home and held a grudge against him 
he portrayed mentzer and marti as hired killers who carried out 
her instructions 
radin was last seen stepping into a limousine with mrs 
greenberger on may 13 1983 en route to a business dinner 
a month later his body was found in a dry riverbed 65 miles 
north of los angeles a location identified at the hearing as a 
frequent target shooting range for the flynt bodyguards radin had 
been repeatedly shot in the head 
the judge ordered the defendants to be arraigned in superior 
court on july 18 she ordered no bail and said the defendants are 
remanded 
the defense attorneys presented no final arguments at the 
preliminary hearing which probed the inner workings of hollywood 
dealmaking the private militia of flynt and the 
multimilliondollar business of cocaine trafficking

the boston ledger a weekly newspaper that combined 
folksy neighborhood news with tough political reporting has ceased 
publication after 52 years 
it was not an easy decision to make but the realities of 
business set in the advertising support was just not there 
publisher frederic n phinney said wednesday 
circulation of the tabloid which was distributed free had gone 
from 48000 in 1982 to 29000 this year 
in the same period advertising revenue fell about 40 percent and 
the staff was cut to two fulltime employees from a peak of eight 
phinney said 
the paper focused on events and personalities in boston 
neighborhoods it also covered the arts and politics and had 
something of a lovehate relationship with the administration of 
kevin white mayor from 1969 to 1985 
kevin white was a great booster of ours even though at times 
we kicked the living daylights out of him phinney said 
at its best the ledger was something of a cross between a 
neighborhood paper for back baybeacon hill and the village 
voice a paper that tried to take an iconoclastic view of life in 
the city added john van scoyoc who was the ledgers editor in 
the late 1970s and is now managing editor at wgbhtv 
the newspaper was founded in 1937 and was named the back bay 
ledgerbeacon hill times until phinney and his father bought it in 
1967 and changed the name to the boston ledger 
the phinney family company citizen group publications inc also 
publishes two paidcirculation weeklies the allstonbrighton 
citizen and the brookline citizen and a free weekly the 
charlestown ledger 
phinney said the boston ledgers losses had been draining the 
other papers which will continue to be published

gun owners in florida are required to 
take reasonable steps to keep loaded weapons out of the hands of 
children under a bill signed into law today by gov bob martinez 
the legislation doesnt take effect until october but a national 
guncontrol advocate says lives are probably already being saved 
people in florida and elsewhere have become more aware of the 
dangers of leaving loaded firearms where children can get access to 
them said bernard horn state legislative director for handgun 
control inc 
publicity on gun accidents involving children has not only 
increased public awareness but prompted more safety measures horn 
said in a telephone interview from his washington office tuesday 
lawmakers from about two dozen states have contacted horns 
organization about the florida bill including california new york 
illinois ohio wisconsin connecticut massachusetts maryland and 
virginia 
i think were going to see some action in some of these 
states said dennis smith director of public information for the 
center to prevent handgun violence a nonprofit private research 
organization in washington 
florida lawmakers passed the legislation in june after three 
children were killed and two wounded in separate gun accidents 
around the state during a single week 
i think the unfortunate tragic deaths speak for themselves 
said sen john grant a republican who who sponsored the bill 
the legislation requires gun owners to take reasonable 
precautions to keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out 
of the hands of children under 16 years old such as using a trigger 
lock or keeping the weapon in a locked box 
if a child shoots someone as the result of a careless gun owner 
the adult could be charged with a felony punishable by up to five 
years in prison and a 5000 fine a gun owner faces a misdemeanor 
and up to 60 days in jail and a 500 fine if a minor threatens 
someone with the gun or displays it in public

some common birth control methods fail more often 
than a previous study indicated a new analysis suggests 
twentysix percent of women using spermicides become pregnant 
accidentally during the first year of use rather than the 19 
percent previously calculated researchers said 
condoms had about a 14 percent failure rate in the new analysis 
rather than 10 percent 
the analysis appears in the current issue of family planning 
perspectives the journal is published by the alan guttmacher 
institute a nonprofit organization in new york that studies 
fertility issues 
the authors elise jones and jacqueline forrest of the institute 
cautioned that the new estimates are subject to a substantial 
degree of uncertainty 
the estimates are much higher than would be expected if the birth 
control methods were used consistently and correctly the 
researchers said 
they sought to refine estimates published in 1986 by using 
results of a birth control questionnaire filled out in 1987 by 9480 
women who had abortions 
other new estimates for firstyear failure include 6 percent 
rather than 5 percent for the pill 16 percent rather than 14 
percent for the diaphragm 16 percent rather than 13 percent for the 
rhythm method and 22 percent rather than 14 percent for other 
methods 
sterilization was not included because failures are rare and 
intrauterine devices were omitted because of difficulty in getting 
reliable data

striking nurses walked picket lines today 
for a second day outside northern californias largest pediatric 
hospital which transferred dozens of critically ill children to 
other facilities 
a line of ambulances began moving young patients out even before 
the strike began with the day shift tuesday morning as some 200 
nurses struck for a 26 percent wage increase childrens hospital 
spokesman steve tiger said most of those transferred went to nearby 
hospitals but many children could eventually be sent to facilities 
as far away as los angeles and seattle 
the hospital has transferred 88 children so far discharged 15 
and 41 remained today tiger said those remaining are the most 
critically ill and will be taken care of by doctors and supervisors 
the hospital issued a statement saying a 7weekold premature 
baby died tuesday afternoon after being transferred to a berkeley 
hospital but tiger said they were not implying the death was linked 
to the transfer 
were definitely not saying that we think it would be 
irresponsible to imply that tiger said we assumed that the 
information would get out anyway we thought it was more appropriate 
that we release it 
california nurses association spokeswoman maureen anderson said 
nurses on the picket line didnt know about the death until they 
were approached by reporters anderson said she was upset the 
hospital decided to issue the statement 
this is just going to inflame the situation and im sure the 
family is having a hard enough time already anderson said 
one of the placards carried by a nurse on the picket line read 
improve pay to improve care 
were special people with special skills and we need special 
pay said a 34yearold picketing nurse who identified herself 
only as jean 
the california nurses association which represents the 700 
nurses at childrens rejected an 18 percent wage hike over two 
years by a 41 margin on monday 
if we dont do enough to attract people we wont have the best 
and the brightest nurses around for these children said intensive 
care nurse karen cooper calling the strike a painful step to 
avert an even worse labor shortage crisis in the 1990s 
union officials are seeking salaries that would range between 
39400 and 49100 
childrens nurses now make between 32000 and 39000 which 
places them among the highest paid in the nation 
no new talks were scheduled the nurses previous contract

willie bs first date wednesday wasnt exactly a 
romantic triumph but zoo keepers hope the shy 31yearold 
gorillas stroll in the jungle with two females is the start of 
something big 
the 450pound primate caged alone from infancy until last year 
was allowed outdoors with female companions for the first time at 
zoo atlanta 
anxiously chaperoning the encounter were experts who want the 
western lowland gorilla to mate but who worry the lonely male wont 
know how to behave around the opposite sex 
today is the first day of the rest of willie bs life as a 
social animal said zoo director terry maple whether he will 
reproduce is still an open question 
there wasnt any monkey business wednesday but there were 
encouraging signs during willies encounter in the zoos new 45 
million african rain forest habitat 
willie wasnt aggressive toward the smaller females in keeping 
with the species typical behavior that casts the female in the lead 
mating role 
at one point the younger female 6yearold kinyani approached 
willie briefly then scampered off and sat thats normal because 
males and females dont have much to do with each other in most 
circumstances said ronald nadler a gorilla specialist with the 
yerkes regional primate research center at emory university 
the females are on loan from yerkes 
willie b who lived in a cage until the rain forest habitat 
opened last year was introduced to female gorillas gradually over 
recent months wednesday was the first time they had been let 
outdoors together and they will share the habitat from now on 
chances of willie b mating are a long shot because he has been 
isolated in captivity so long said sam winslow curator of 
mammals at the zoo 
zoo keepers want willie a silverback or adult male to mate 
and add to genetic diversity in the worlds population of captive 
gorillas 
but this may be more important to willie than his species the 
300 western lowland gorillas in zoos worldwide are reproducing at a 
rate adequate to prevent inbreeding winslow said 
willie b a favorite with visitors is named for former atlanta 
mayor william b hartsfield

the bush administration said wednesday that it 
wants to continue some exports of waste including hazardous 
material as long as it is handled in an environmentally sound 
manner 
we do not believe that a total ban on all waste exports would 
be sound policy said scott a hajost of the environmental 
protection agency 
frederick m bernthal the state departments environmental 
specialist agreed 
exports of hazardous wastes should be allowed to proceed so 
long as they are handled in an environmentally sound manner 
bernthal said adding that the department will ask congress to ban 
all such exports unless the united states has an agreement with the 
importing government detailing safe handling 
wastes not defined as hazardous can be exported freely without 
the knowledge of the us government and perhaps without the 
knowledge of the importing government as well bernthal said 
we do not know how much of this waste is currently exported in 
some cases we have learned of the export only when problems arise in 
the importing country 
he said britain and west germany have recycling plants that the 
united states either doesnt have enough of or doesnt have at all 
some waste also is sent to canada because its plants are closer to 
where it originates 
some waste even hazardous waste contains metals that can be 
sold in other countries 
an internationl convention was signed in basel switzerland in 
march on the movement of hazardous waste it will become binding 
when 20 governments ratify it possibly next year 
the united states will decide soon whether to sign the agreement 
bernthal said 
bernthal objected to a bill that would require all international 
agreements to prohibit us exports unless the importing country has 
provisions for dealing with it that are as strict as us 
requirements 
there is no international consensus that one particular method 
of disposing of wastes is the only method which protects human 
health and the environment he said 
hajost suggested that the bill should allow the government to 
stop exports if it has reason to believe that the waste will not be 
handled properly in the importing country 
the bill was supported by william y brown of waste management 
inc a large private company because it requires a government 
permit for the export of any waste 
the world is too small for any nation to observe a double 
standard on the environment one for what it does within its 
boundaries and another for what it can do in the rest of the 
world he said

the nato allies are ready two months 
ahead of schedule with a proposal to the warsaw pact to reduce 
troops and nonnuclear armories in europe secretary of state james 
a baker iii said wednesday 
baker also disclosed at a news conference here the western allies 
would call for ceilings of 5700 combat aircraft and 1900 combat 
helicopters for each of the military alliances 
baker said the proposal which would limit us and soviet troops 
in europe to 275000 on each side would be submitted in vienna on 
thursday 
that is the last scheduled session before a long summer recess 
the talks are due to resume sept 5 in the austrian capital 
by tabling this proposal we are taking a step toward ending 
the military division of europe baker said 
in budapest with president bush baker also praised the soviets 
for accepting a us proposal for trial monitoring of a 
stillunfinished strategic weapons limitation treaty 
we think it is very good that the soviets have responded 
positively baker said 
despite complaints by several private american analysts that it 
was a stalling tactic baker said trial monitoring might well move 
arms control forward rather than retarding it 
the negotiations to cut longrange nuclear bombers missiles and 
submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent are being held in geneva 
soviet deputy foreign minister viktor p karpov said monday he 
accepted the bush administrations argument that the two sides could 
avoid misunderstandings by finishing trial weapons inspections 
before the agreement was concluded 
the talks between nato and the warsaw pact to reduce troops 
tanks nonnuclear aircraft and armored personnel carriers are 
proceeding on a separate track in vienna 
submission of naos proposal before the recess gives the soviets 
and their allies nearly two months to prepare a reply 
bush and the leaders of the 15 other nato countries agreed at a 
summit meeting in brussels in late may to make a weapons reduction 
proposal 
the president said at the time that an accord could be completed 
within six months to a year 
among the ceilings tentatively adopted then were 20000 tanks for 
each side and 16500 to 24000 artillery pieces 
there was no numerical agrement at the summit on combat aircraft 
and helicopters setting ceilings now is not likely to end a debate 
with the soviets over the weapons baker acknowledged 
negotiators will still have to grapple with deciding which planes 
are defensive in nature and thereby outside bounds of the treaty 
also the soviets and their allies might try to impose 
restrictions on british and french planes nato is determined to 
resist 
the decision to present natos proposal before the talks recessed 
was made last friday in brussels by a panel of senior nato officials 
called the highlevel task force a us official said 
baker related the decision to move quickly on arms control to 
bushs visit to poland and hungary 
these efforts complement each other and we think together 
advance the cause of a europe which is whole and a europe which is 
free 
he rejected meanwhile a soviet contention that another bush 
timetable accomplishing the reductions by 1993 could not be met 
baker said hungarian foreign minister gyula horn had given 
assurances that the warsaw pact decided at a meeting last week not 
to let the quest for an agreement get bogged down in details 
a senior soviet communist party official said tuesday in moscow 
that his country would not be able to make all the proposed 
reductions by 1993 
and he said completing the treaty within a year also was unlikely 
lt gen viktor starodubov said too many weapons and troops would 
have to be cut and that moscow had tried to explain this to the bush 
administration the general is chief of the disarmament branch of 
the communist partys policymaking central committee

the bush administration tried wednesday to calm 
growing criticism of its draft cleanair legislation and urged 
opposing environmental and industry critics to stop nitpicking 
this thing apart 
officials said they were worried that intense criticism of the 
proposed legislation efore it even reached congress could lead to 
legislative gridlock similar to that which has prevented passage of 
a bill the past decade 
this is the best hope weve had in a long time to break the 
10year logjam said epa chief spokesman david cohen we are 
being absolutely faithful to the presidents commitments to start 
nitpicking this thing apart may pave the way to the gridlock that 
has prevented reauthorization of the clean air act 
after eight years of inaction on air pollution by the reagan 
administration bush promised on june 12 to curb three major 
threats to the nations environment and to the health of millions of 
americans acid rain urban air pollution and toxic air emissions 
but he only had available then a 14page outline for the first 
major presidential proposal for cleaning the nations air since 
1977 as legislative drafters worked to fill in details of the bill 
copies of their working language have leaked out and the opposing 
sides have begun reacting 
this week environmental groups and the chairman of the house 
environment subcommittee contended the latest draft dated june 30 
weakened the presidents promise for a strong pollutionfighting 
campaign industry groups said the environmental protection agency 
was trying to make the language tougher than bush wants 
the environmental side said bushs proposal was weakened in 
sections on auto pollution emission of toxic chemicals and 
reduction of the substances causing acid rain 
an industry coalition said the draft was tougher than bush 
promised on auto emissions took away the flexibility of states to 
deal with their particular pollution problems and unnecessarily 
increased requirements on industry to reduce acid rain 
william rosenberg assistant epa administrator for air and 
radiatioin said its unfair to say were deviating from bushs 
wishes adding that the proposal would get the job done in a 
costeffective way you have a bill thats 286 pages the fact sheet 
was 14 pages when you get to the specifics its much more 
complicated 
the legislative language is a far cry from what the president 
said he wanted to do achieve clean air for every american said 
rep henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the house energy and 
commerce environment subcommittee in the area of smog they seem 
to be willing to give in to the auto industry rather than 
assisting breathing americans to give them a break 
william fay head of an industry coalition called the clean air 
working group said we think exactly the opposite my response is 
that someone got carried away in drafting this thing there are 
things in the staff draft that go far beyond what the president 
suggested 
one of the most crucial disputes is over motor vehicle pollution 
the draft language would reduce the exhaust standard for unburned 
fuel from 041 grams per mile to 025 grams but while the current 
law requires that each car meet the standard the draft legislation 
would permit automakers to achieve the reduction by averaging all 
their autos 
waxman said the automakers already are producing cars that would 
meet the new limits and would have no incentive under the bush plan 
to make further improvements fay called portions of the auto 
section extreme 
the epas rosenberg predicted the automakers would achieve the 
additional pollution reduction promised by bush because they would 
need a margin of safety below the new limits if the limits were 
exceeded the car makers could face an epaordered recall 
rosenberg also brushed off environmental groups criticism that 
bush would push back from the year 2000 to 2001 his promised 
deadline for reducing acid rain emissions and he rebutted 
environmentalists insistence that the presidents promise of a 
10millionton sulfur dioxide reduction the major acid rain 
component was being scaled back to 9 million tons 
rosenberg said bushs year 2000 deadline always meant dec 31 
that year and the draft plan simply pushed that back one day to 
jan 1 2001 
the 9millionton sulfur dioxide reduction is used in the draft 
because the administration is counting the 1millionton reduction 
already achieved by smelting plants according to rosenberg 
responding to another criticism from the environmental side 
rosenberg said draft language requiring consideration of economic 
costs in ordering reduced toxic chemical emissions was always bushs 
goal

chinas premier and communist party chief on 
wednesday urged their top diplomats to do a better job in presenting 
the official version of its suppression of unarmed prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
staterun media also highlighted visits by foreigners in a 
propaganda campaign to show that diplomatic relations have not 
suffered from international condemnation of the june 34 military 
crackdown in beijing 
jiang zemin newly appointed general secretary of the communist 
party told 151 ambassadors and senior diplomats they must help 
foreign friends get rid of their misunderstandings of recent 
events in china 
jiang said the diplomats must increase their work in explaining 
the truth to counter rumors of western reports 
the united states and other western countries have suspended 
highlevel government contacts and imposed other sanctions to 
protest the attack 
foreign countries have also denounced the reported arrests of 
more than 2000 people and the executions of at least 27 who joined 
protests 
china claimed the use of force was necessary to put down what it 
says was a counterrevolutionary rebellion to overthrow the 
government it says about 200 civilians were killed in the military 
assault on the city 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death 
toll may have been as high as 3000 
premier li peng told the diplomats that overseas chinese students 
who participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to china 
and wont be punished 
because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the 
western media they didnt understand the true situation and 
participated in protests and said some extremist words staterun 
tv quoted li as saying 
many western countries have extended the visas of students who 
say they fear arrest or persecution if they return to china many 
students say they dont want to return to their country 
accelerating a brain drain of chinese students who abandon their 
homeland and settle abroad 
the official media told domestic audiences that foreigners were 
returning to china and the nations relations with foreign countries 
were back to normal 
television showed senior leaders in meetings with tourism 
delegates from east germany kuwait and the united states 
president yang shangkun a key player in the military assault on 
studentoccupied tiananmen square met david f lee and peter m 
chow of the los angeles branch of the national association of 
chineseamericans and praised their efforts to promote uschinese 
friendship 
lee and chow were in beijing for a tourism conference chinas 
annual 2 billion tourist industry has nearly dried up in the past 
month because of the imposition of martial law and the violence in 
the capital 
the official peoples daily on wednesday also appealed to taiwan 
not to let chinas troubles slow down the easing of tensions 
the daily acknowledged the crackdown on the student movement 
cited by taiwan as proof the communists cannot be trusted had hurt 
efforts to increase their contacts 
the recent turmoils in some places on the mainland and the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion in beijing plus truthdistorting 
propaganda by some chinese and foreign news media have to some 
extent had a negative impact on such activities it said 
in the past two years taiwan has eased restrictions on travel to 
the mainland and allowed indirect trade estimated at 27 billion 
last year but rejected beijings overtures for direct talks 
chinese police have arrested 13 people accused of spying for 
taiwan in connection with the prodemocracy movement and on tuesday 
expelled taiwanese journalist huang tehpei

hungarys enthusiastic welcome for 
president bush and some of the comments made by its leaders may rile 
budapests east bloc allies 
on wednesday premier miklos nemeth presented bush with a piece 
of the barbed wire that once was the iron curtain along the 
hungarian border with neutral austria 
the hungarians started dismantling the barbed wire in may and 
the plaque that went with nemeths gift expressed hope other 
eastwest barriers will fall soon 
its believed that artificial physical and spiritual walls 
still existing in the world some day shall collapse everywhere 
said the plaque which a delighted bush read to reporters 
the clear reference to walls seems likely to upset east 
germany which built the berlin wall in 1961 to prevent mass 
migration of its citizens to west germany 
east germany and its closest east bloc ally czechoslovakia have 
both recently criticized hungarys political and economic reforms 
but hungarys biggest fight is with neighboring romania the east 
bloc nation most critical of the current changes sweeping hungary 
poland and the soviet union 
the ideological differences are fueled by centuriesdeep 
rivalries over transylvania a region controlled by hungary for 
hundreds of years but given to romania after world war i 
it is now home to many of the 17 million ethnic hungarians who 
live in romania and who budapest alleges are being mistreated 
romanian president nicolae ceausescu has already signaled his 
displeasure emphasizing his rejection of any reform of the orthodox 
communism he avows ceausescu told a group of arab visitors 
it is true that this displeases some who attempt even now to 
interfere with a few million dollars in the development of some 
other countries the official romanian news agency agerpres 
reported 
the war of words between the two nations is likely to flare up 
anew over a request reportedly made to bush on wednesday by the 
speaker of hungarys parliament matyas szuros 
laszlo kovacs no 2 official in hungarys foreign ministry said 
szuros told bush that hungary is concerned about the fate of all 
hungarians abroad and asked the president to use his good offices 
concerning human rights violations regardless of where they may 
occur 
on monday hungarian foreign minister gyula horn assured 
reporters that the first visit to hungary by a us president did 
not mean budapest was pulling away too fast from its east bloc 
allies 
hungary wants to modernize its ties with the soviet bloc he 
said but we do not intend to alter our relations or to get away 
from the soviet union or the other socialist countries 
and on wednesday imre pozsgay the most outspoken reformer in 
hungarys fourman communist leadership said his countrys moves 
toward democracy are irreversible and that his party will step

a 22yearold woman went ahead with an abortion 
after a judge cleared the way by throwing out an injunction obtained 
by a former boyfriend the womans lawyer said wednesday 
the case is over said clayton ruby the lawyer for barbara 
dodd after her client entered a clinic for the abortion tuesday 
night 
earlier tuesday justice w gibson gray of the ontario supreme 
court set aside the injunction blocking the abortion ms dodds 
former boyfriend gregory murphy had obtained the injunction last 
week 
were gratified by the judgment said robin rowe national 
coordinator of the canadian abortion rights action league she 
called the injunction a fluke and said i dont think legally 
its going to set any kind of precedent 
jim hughes of the campaign life coalition said he was optimistic 
despite the outcome because the case had produced the first 
restraining order against an abortion in that sense it was very 
positive he said 
hughes said he spoke with murphy and shared his indignation at 
the happy carnivallike atmosphere surrounding the killing of the 
doddmurphy baby 
both murphy 23 and ms dodd are hearing impaired ms dodd who 
was 15 weeks pregnant listened to the court proceedings through a 
sign language interpreter 
tears were in her eyes outside the court as ruby told reporters 
she hopes that no other woman will ever be put in this situation 
the supreme court of canada on jan 28 declared the national 
abortion law unconstitutional saying it infringed on the rights of 
woman the outcome legally made abortion a subject between a woman 
and her doctor 
the recent us supreme court decision on abortion which gave 
states greater power to restrict abortions was widely publicized in 
canada 
the house of commons has been split on the issue

charles haughey was elected wednesday to 
lead a coalition government reluctantly ending the goitalone 
tradition of his fianna fail party 
it will be haugheys fourth term as taoiseach as the irish prime 
minister is called 
the formation of this administration is a new departure in our 
political life haughey told the dail parliament my fianna 
fail colleagues and i are making a wholehearted and sincere 
commitment to this new administration 
the pact with the sixmember progressive democratic party ended 
nearly a month of uncertainty and maneuvering since fianna fail fell 
short of a majority in the june 15 elections 
the government pledged to try to cut the standard tax rate now 
34 percent to 25 percent by 1993 to create 35000 jobs per year 
and to restore some of the spending cut from the health service 
it was the first time that fianna fail which formed its first 
government in 1932 had accepted a coalition 
coalitions dont work haughey said last week as he tried to 
line up the votes to put a minority government in power 
in the end however haughey was forced to meet progressive 
democratic leader desmond omalleys demand for two seats in the 
cabinet 
omalley will be minister for industry and commerce and his 
party also gained the energy portfolio 
brian lenihan will continue as deputy prime minister but will 
shift from foreign minister to defense minister lenihan missed the 
election campaign while recovering from a liver transplant at the 
mayo clinic in the united states 
gerry collins the former justice minister succeeds him as 
foreign minister 
omalley 50 of limerick had been expelled from fianna fail in 
1985 after leading two unsuccessful revolts against haughey the 
party leader since 1979 
fianna fail deputies in the dail voted for the coalition 
agreement tuesday following a private meeting in which according to 
the irish times nearly every speaker opposed the coalition 
haugheys previous government elected in 1987 enjoyed the 
support of the secondlargest party fine gael as it embarked on 
drastic spending cuts and a round of tax reductions 
under that government ireland posted trade surpluses after years 
of deficits government borrowing was reduced from 129 percent of 
gross national product in 1986 to 4 percent this year and inflation 
remained under 4 percent 
however a drop of nearly two points in the unemployment rate 
still left it at 16 percent and the numbers of jobseekers leaving 
the country increased 
haughey called the election after the government was unable to 
block a bill to create a fund for hemophiliacs who had contracted 
aids that defeat he said foreshadowed future difficulties for the 
government and he appealed to the nation for a majority 
after opinion polls found a deep distaste for yet another 
election and haughey agreed to talk about a coalition last week 
conor cruise obrien wrote in the times of london that it was the 
end of civil war politics in ireland 
it was only this week that the politics of civil war or 
rather the fianna fail ideology derived from that memory were seen 
to interfere with the business of governing the country obrien 
wrote when the people saw that they called a halt to it 
the coalition was unprecedented said michael gallagher a 
lecturer in politics at trinity college but its longterm 
significance will be apparent only some time down the road if the 
coalition falters he said wednesday fianna fail might revert to 
its nocoalition stance 
fianna fail was formed from the losing side of the 192223 civil 
war the losers wanted an independent and united ireland 
the winners who were willing to accept a divided island within 
the british commonwealth are associated with fine gael the 
secondlargest party with 55 seats in the dail

air force officials taking their case for the 
stealth bomber to the house were met wednesday with stiff resistance 
from budgetconscious lawmakers and a warning that the 
halfbilliondollar aircraft could become a museum piece 
seven to eight billion dollars a year on one weapons system is 
twice as much as were spending on star wars i just cant sell 
that rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee told air force officials arguing for the second straight 
day on capitol hill for the b2 bomber 
air force secretary donald rice and chief of staff larry welch 
said that the radarevading bomber outpaces improvements in soviet 
air defenses and that termination of the 70 billion program would 
undermine the nations nuclear deterrent force 
the officials also reminded lawmakers that the government has 
already invested about 23 billion in the plane and that stretching 
out the program over a number of years could raise the aircrafts 
price considerably 
by aspins calculations a single b2 bomber could cost about 1 
billion 
we hope our witnesses today will be able to put the b2 program 
into perspective for us aspin said at the start of the hearing 
otherwise there remains the very real possibility that the b2 
will become a museum piece 
members of the house panel reacted to the presentation much the 
same way as did members of the senate armed services panel who 
listened to the air force officials on tuesday 
when the chairman tells you youre not going to get it 
politically you can put it in your pocket and take it to the 
bank said rep william dickinson of alabama ranking republican 
on the committee 
i dont want to equate you to a used car salesman you did a 
good job with the charts said rep larr j hopkins rky we 
have to decide do we want to put this much money in a single 
program can we afford to buy this program 
rep herbert h bateman rva put it more poignantly 
i want to put my head down and cry he said you made a 
compelling case but i dont know where to get the money to pay for 
it 
recent estimates put the b2 bomber at a cost of between 500 
million and 750 million a plane making it the most expensive 
aircraft in history 
the pentagon is proposing spending 47 billion in fiscal 1990 
for the bomber and about 24 billion over a threeyear peak period 
78 billion in fiscal 1992 84 billion in fiscal 1993 and 77 
billion in fiscal 1994 
eight billion on one weapons system aspin said only 12 
other countries have a defense budget higher than that is this 
conceivable no chance 
lawmakers have balked at the price for a single plane and 
responded with incredulity to the possiblity of stretching out the 
program at an increased cost of about 2 billion more a year 
if you make annual cost acceptable the sticker price becomes 
unacceptable said aspin if you make sticker price acceptable 
the annual cost becomes unacceptable i dont know how to fix it 
in response rice stressed that the b2 is critical to 
deterrence and told the committee that this system despite the 
sticker shock comes down as the only candidate for some categories 
of things we want to do 
rice and welch said pentagon estimates show that the soviet union 
has spent more than 350 billion on air defense over a 20year 
period and plans to invest more money 
that very expensive array of defenses in largely ineffective 
against an aircraft with b2 capabilities the air force said in 
its presentation 
but aspin questioned why the air force always argues that the 
soviet air defense is robust when it discusses the b2 but then 
suggests that the soviet system is not as impenetrable when it asks 
for just 14 billion to improve the electronics system of the b1 
bomber which could be used instead of the b2 
soviet air defense let a fellow coming in from germany in red 
square aspin said referring to the west german youth matthias 
rust who flew undetected into the soviet union two years ago 
rice argued that the united states cannot predict the level of 
capability in the soviet air defense but we certainly can see the 
trend 
there is no doubt that capability is increasing and increasing 
dramatically with improvements to their radars rice said

soldiers fired on guerrilla bases 
around kabul and the eastern city of jalalabad on wednesday after 
the insurgents rejected a ceasefire call and fired rockets into the 
capital the government said 
the ceasefire took effect at midnight tuesday to mark the 
islamic holiday of eid aladha and was to have lasted four days it 
collapsed after the rebels launched seven rockets on the capital and 
government forces fired back said foreign ministry spokesman 
mohammad nabi amani 
he did not know the number of casualties because most offices 
including the military information department were closed in 
observance of the holiday 
amani also said rebels fired rockets on jalalabad the capital of 
nangarhar province the guerrillas have been trying to capture the 
city afghanistans fifth largest since march 
we had no option but to fire back the foreign ministry 
spokesman said 
hours before the ceasefire began government soldiers fired at 
least 100 rockets at guerrilla bases in the hills around kabul a 
city of 225 million people 
the rockets were fired late tuesday into the paghman mountains 
12 miles northwest of kabul amani said 
we had information that the opponents had massed a large number 
of rockets to hit kabul during the eid so we carried out a 
preemptive operation he said 
the government had said its troops would halt offensive actions 
until midnight saturday to celebrate the islamic holiday held 40 
days after the end of ramadan the moslem month of fasting 
but a spokesman for one of the seven main guerrilla groups based 
in pakistan rejected the offer 
the ceasefire doesnt have any meaning for the muhajedeen 
because we began our fight to get rid of the communists and the 
problem is not solved said the spokesman who goes by the name of 
wakil 
the guerrillas supported by the united states and mostly based 
in pakistan are trying to overthrow the sovietbacked government 
that seized power in a 1978 coup 
afghanistan and the soviet union have alleged the guerrillas 
along with pakistani military advisers are planning an offensive on 
kabul and president najibs government has warned it may shell 
pakistan 
pakistan has denied najibs charges it is directly involved in 
the attacks 
the soviet union ended nine years of military involvement in 
afghanistan when it withdrew the last of its troops on feb 15 under 
a unmediated accord moscow has continued to supply arms to the 
kabul government

outofcontrol fires a 3000acre blaze in brush and trees on 
steep inaccessible terrain near big sur calif 
firefighters also were on the job in arizona new mexico 
colorado utah and nebraska and the forecast in the west called for 
scattered rain but also lightning which means more fires 
there were 8500 firefighters on the line nationwide wednesday 
but that was expected to fall to 5000 by thursday morning the 
boise interagency fire center reported 
weve had cooler temperatures and scattered rainfall in the 
southwest that have helped things out said arnold hartigan 
information officer at center which coordinates firefighting 
nationwide but dry lighting has been forecast for the sierra 
nevadas in california and in oregon and washington east of the 
cascades 
but for the rest we have a couple days reprieve 
fire crews in northwestern nebraska used heavy equipment and 
shovels to dig a fire lane around an area 8 miles wide and 22 miles 
long we have fully contained the fire said jerry larson 
deputy state fire marshal the weather is cooperating the winds 
have died down 
larson after flying over the area scaled back his estimate of 
burned acreage to 50000 to 100000 acres 
the forecast was for lower temperatures and a chance of showers 
and thunderstorms its a mixed blessing the chance of rain 
versus the chance of lightning larson said 
lightning sparked the fire that had burned since saturday 
charring acres of fort robinson state park and ranchland the park 
includes the site of old fort robinson a onetime cavalry post 
where sioux chief crazy horse was killed by his jailers 
in colorado about a halfinch of rain fell overnight on a

acres only one fire in inaccessible terrain near green river was 
reported out of control

containing a 2987acre near big sur to friday evening said maeton 
freel a forest service spokesman the fire which investigators 
believe was started by an arsonist was about 55 percent contained 
by 937 firefighters freel reported

had forced the change in the containment time some of those 
slopes are at a 45 degree angle he said

an unlikely coalition of liberal and 
conservative factions said wednesday that it will back a plan to add 
100000 officers to police forces around the nation 
this is certainly not an ideological issue this is a survival 
issue wellknown conservative rep bob dornan rcalif said at 
the unveiling of the senate bill 
rep barney frank dmass as liberal as dornan is conservative 
also has been an outspoken backer of the police corps act of 1989 
which would trade scholarships for service 
dornan frank and rep joe kennedy dmass introduced a similar 
measure in the house last month and appeared wednesday with their 
senate colleagues to offer bipartisan support 
the bill is designed to boost state and local police forces by up 
to 22 percent while creating collegeeducated officers to cope with 
challenges such as racial tension and gang warfare it would add up 
to 25000 officers a year during the first four years of the program 
the idea was developed in 1982 by a crime study group headed by 
new york city lawyer adam walinsky and jonathan rubenstein a police 
expert who has worked with the philadelphia police 
after seven years of lobbying walinsky believes the time is ripe 
for congressional action 
my thought is that this is a great idea whose idea has come 
sen arlen specter rpa said at wednesdayse news conference 
participating students would get federally guaranteed education 
loans and have up to 40000 repaid by the government when they 
complete four years in the state police or a local police department 
in a sponsoring state 
another sponsor sen jim sasser dtenn said he wants to 
create a pilot program in the district of columbia providing 50 
students with scholarships in exhange for fouryear work commitments 
washington dc has become a paradigm of the nations growing 
problem with violent crime sasser said it will provide a 
rigorous test for the police corps concept 
the measure envisions bringing the nations total police force to 
580000 within four years of the programs implementation 
the cost is projected to rise each year as the program builds 
from 50 million in 1990 to 290 million in 1992 and more later 
specter said 
the measure has the support of the national fraternal order of 
police and the national association of police organizations which 
represents 90000 rankandfile officers 
other senate sponsors include democrats joseph lieberman of 
connecticut bill bradley of new jersey john kerry of 
massachusetts harry reid of nevada and republicans warren rudman 
of new hampshire and trent lott of mississippi

india said wednesday it will not 
withdraw its peacekeeping troops from sri lanka until the 
implementation of a peace accord aimed at ending an insurgency by 
tamil rebels 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi made the declaration in a 
letter to president ranasinghe premadasa 
india has traditionally been mindful of the sanctity of the 
agreements it signs with other countries and of commitments solemnly 
undertaken under such agreements gandhi said in the letter 
india will under no circumstances deviate from this policy 
affecting our concerns 
the message amounted to a rejection of premadasas appeal to 
gandhi to withdraw the 40000 indian soldiers deployed in sri lanka 
by the end of the month 
the troops were deployed after india and sri lanka signed an 
accord july 29 1987 that called for ethnic tamil rebels to 
surrender their weapons in exchange for limited autonomy 
india moved in troops to enforce the tamil surrender but the 
indian soldiers began fighting the largest tamil militia the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam when the group refused to accept 
the accord 
colombo asked india to withdraw its troops after it started talks 
with the tamil tigers in may the first direct contact between the 
two sides since the insurgency began in 1983 
india says a premature withdrawal of its troops could spark more 
ethnic violence on the indian ocean island and could lead to the 
killing of moderate tamils the impasse has soured relations between 
the nations 
i have repeatedly said that the indian peacekeeping forces 
withdrawal should be worked out through joint consultations along 
with a simultaneous schedule for the implementation of the indiasri 
lanka agreement gandhi said in his letter we are willing to 
resume discussions on this subject at any time and place of your 
convenience 
gandhi also said that if joint consultations were not possible 
we will have to decide the details of the withdrawal 
unilaterally consistent with our responsibilities and obligations 
the tamil insurgency has left about 9000 people dead including 
about 800 indian soldiers 
india became involved in the ethnic troubles because of the 
sympathies of its politically powerful 60 million tamils to the 
rebel cause 
the 3 million predominantly hindu tamils in sri lanka complain of 
discrimination by the buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of 
the islands 16 million people 
also wednesday the government closed the nations six 
universities and sent in security forces to search the campuses in a 
crackdown on sinhalese militants 
colleges reopened may 10 after being closed for two years in an 
effort to curb student unrest and violent antigovernment 
demonstrations 
four of the universities are in the islands central and southern 
districts the stronghold of the sinhalese radical peoples 
liberation front the other two are in the northeast 
the government blames the sinhalese radicals for more than 3500 
political killings since then the extremists allege too many 
concessions were given to the tamils

homeland said wednesday hes worried his return is all a dream that 
has made him late for work in washington 
tasnadi 64 and an associated press photographer covering 
president bushs trip here spoke of the emotion he feels seeing the 
sites from his childhood including the bridge he used to cross on 
the way to school and the church he attended

returning 
tasnadi said he told bush that several relatives including two 
of his wifes sisters were still in hungary 
i would like to meet them tasnadi quoted the president as 
saying 
so after a day as part of the photographic pool covering the 
president tasnadi gathered up his relatives and introduced them to 
the president 
tasnadi was just shy of his 26th birthday when he and his 
sweetheart maria seized upon the first heavy snowfall of the 
195051 winter to seek a new life a championship skier he 
concocted a story about heading for the slopes for skiing to avoid

this fortress of despotism the oldest and most persistent in the 
world will be upset by the force of the people and the republican

wherever he went wednesday in this city 
of old world charm george bush was given a warm welcome that 
reflected hungarys fascination with america 
at the university where he got a standing ovation in the market 
where he bought a dozen peaches on the running track where he 
jogged with hungarian children his reception was enthusiastic 
and it was clear from his first remarks here to 10000 people 
who had withstood torrential rains and high winds for tuesdays 
arrival ceremony that bush was appreciative 
long after this rain is gone he said then im going to 
remember the warmth of the welcome of the people of hungary 
wednesdays events if anything were fodder for even fonder 
memories thousands lined the presidential motorcade routes pouring 
out of offices and stores to wave or just get a glimpse of their 
important guest 
the fascination of hungarians extended even to the downtown press 
centers set up for the bush trip where gaggles gathered throughout 
the day 
look white house one hungarian father proudly told his son 
as a reporter wearing a white house pass dashed by 
after early morning meetings with the countrys leaders bush met 
with 13 students and wound up giving two a ride to karl marx 
university for his speech lauding hungarys moves toward a 
freemarket economy 
along the way he abruptly had his motorcade stopped to greet 
wellwishers lining his path plunging into the crowd at one point 
he spent more than a minute talking with three small children 
after the speech interrupted numerous times by applause and 
given a standing ovation at its end bush was surrounded by another 
adoring crowd at the nearby dimitrov square food market 
the president paid for his peaches and making his way through 
the crowded wroughtiron market told trailing reporters i 
recommend these to you 
ebullient bush shook hands signed autographs and blew kisses to 
the crowds 
later on he was signing autographs again this time on kids 
jogging shoes 
the youngsters were his workout partners as he did laps at a 
sports complex the gaggle of 30 young runners then crowded around 
bush thrusting their shoes and scraps of paper for his signature 
asked at days end to assess his visit bush told a hungarian 
television interviewer 
my reaction is a very emotional reaction because they the 
crowds made both barbara and me feel welcome i think they were 
saying they liked the united states of america very much and of 
course as an american im very moved by that 
the warm welcome reflected the hungarian indeed east european 
fascination with anything from america the land that symbolizes 
the freedom and prosperity many soviet bloc citizens feel they have 
been denied for 40 years 
budapests crowds have been larger and more exuberant than those 
in warsaw where turnouts of just 2000 to 4000 people at 
wreathlaying ceremonies on monday led to press speculation that 
bushs first presidential foray into eastern europe would not rival 
the rapturous crowds that recently greeted soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev in west germany or france 
even before budapests warm welcome however that had begun to 
change in gdansk the tough port city that gave birth to the east 
blocs strongest opposition movement solidarity 
thousands lined the streets when bush rode into the city tuesday 
more than 25000 massed when bush and solidarity founder lech walesa 
spoke at the gdansk monument to workers killed when government 
troops opened fire on strikers in 1970

of the 39 races for mayor and the 15 seats in the legislature 
another 10 seats are distributed to five minority parties in 
proportion to the votes they receive 
most of the states 1488 polling stations opened on schedule at

bolstering president bushs 115 million aid package 
to poland americas key allies at this weekends economic summit 
meeting drew up their own measures to help the economically troubled 
nation 
the western cooperation however was unlikely to amount to much 
more than a show of support for a nation undergoing enormous 
political change 
peter pietsch senior economist at commerzbank in frankfurt west 
germany said the question was whether the assistance would be big 
enough to really help to overcome its problems 
i think poland will not be feeling satisfied about what is 
coming out said pietsch 
bush and the leaders of canada west germany france italy 
britain and japan on friday will hold their first round of 
discussions at the economic summit in paris the annual gathering 
gives its participants a chance to discuss not only the health of 
their economies but any pressing political issues as well 
with the enormous unexpected changes under way in eastern 
europe the summit leaders were expected to devote some of their 
time to ways of encouraging democratic reforms there bush will give 
the leaders his firsthand impressions after winding up a trip 
through poland and hungary 
in warsaw the president said he would ask congress for a 100 
million enterprise fund to support private entrepreneurs in 
poland bush said he would encourage his summit participants to set 
up similar programs 
in budapest bush offered american help to hungary as well 
including a promise to seek mostfavorednation trading status 
which would allow liberal terms for hungarian exports and a 25 
million grant to spur the fledgling freeenterprise system 
as part of the aid package for poland bush promised to seek 
support for an early and generous rescheduling by western 
creditor governments of some of polands foreign debt a burdensome 
39 billion bush said such a move could amount to deferral of about 
5 billion in payments this year 
british prime minister margaret thatcher earlier told polands 
communist party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski that she would 
play a key role in trying to get some payments of the nations 
foreign debt delayed 
france agreed last month to restructure about 12 billion in 
polish debt and provide new bank loans of nearly 100 million west 
germany will stretch out payments on about 13 billion of loans 
owed by poland 
the british government set up a 387 million knowhow fund 
for poland during jaruzelskis june visit to london the fiveyear 
program is designed to train poles to run a more marketoriented 
economy 
mrs thatcher opposes new loans to poland unless they are 
accompanied by a stringent economic program backed by the 
international monetary fund the 151nation lending agency that 
provides help to financially strapped nations 
in granting loans the imf usually wants the countries to take 
measures to slash high inflation rates halt the outflow of badly 
needed capital bolster weak currencies and in general take a more 
marketoriented approach in managing their economies 
british officials say the poles have already gone through a hefty 
amount of foreign credit without making basic changes in the 
structure of the economy 
theres a growing rerealization that for all these debtor 
countries theres no substitute for getting them to tackle the 
central structural problem said a senior british official 
demanding anonymity 
the problems have to be solved there added pietsch 
polands economy is beset by high inflation shortages of meat 
and other food products and a rush by workers to find jobs elsewhere 
western european countries acting through the european 
community have stepped up efforts to increase their economic and 
trade links with poland and other eastern european countries four 
of the summit nations germany britain france and italy are 
members of the 12nation trading bloc also known as the common 
market 
in june 1988 the common market signed a declaration establishing 
official relations with the sovietled socialist economic bloc 
called the council for mutual economic assistance the landmark 
declaration ended three decades of estrangement between europes 
economic halves 
since then the community has signed a trade and cooperation 
agreement with hungary and is close to winding up an agreement with 
poland 
japan too has indicated a willingness to assist poland 
although japans relationship with the east bloc nations is 
weaker than that of the united states and european countries we are 
ready to play an appropriate role to help them said a foreign 
ministry official in tokyo 
foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka told reporters japan would 
pledge to eliminate or reduce tariffs on goods it imports from 
poland 
according to japanese press reports the government also was 
prepared to offer untied bank loans through its exportimport bank 
to back up polands economic and political reforms 
on wednseday secretary of state james a baker iii said he 
expected there would be support for a package of aid to reward 
poland and hungary 
asked if the united states expected wealthy nations such as japan 
and west germany to shoulder a larger part of the burden baker 
replied some countries are in a better position to contribute 
than other countries are 
meanwhile the official polish news agency pap on wednesday 
released part of a letter from jaruzelski to french president 
francois mitterrand proposing a sixpoint aid plan for poland which 
includes 
1 billion over two years in supplies and credit guarantees to 
build up food reserves to enable introduction of a marketoriented 
food economy 
2 billion in credits from the international monetary fund under 
a negotiated adjustment program to last until 1992 
quick debt rescheduling by the paris club for government to 
government loans of polands 39 billion foreign debt 
rolling back some of polands nongovernmentguaranteed debt and 
transforming a portion into other forms of obligations such as 
equity in polish enterprises 
300 million in world bank credits to finance exportoriented 
investments and a 500 million structural adjustment loan to help 
improve polish exports the money would be coupled with improvement 
of access of polish goods to western markets 
500 million from the world bank or european investment bank 
over three years to finance food processing and storage facility 
improvements giving poland the infrastructure it lacks to market 
agricultural products abroad

federal judge alcee l hastings welcomed the 
support of new york minister al sharpton in fighting impeachment 
proceedings wednesday but stopped short of agreeing with sharptons 
contention that the senate effort is racially motivated 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida history is 
accused of plotting to obtain a 150000 payoff lying about it to a 
jury that acquitted him in 1983 and improperly disclosing 
information obtained from a wiretap 
he was impeached a year ago and is now on trial by the senate 
which could remove him from the bench and take away his 89500 
judicial salary a 12member panel of senators is hearing evidence 
and will report to the full senate which will make the final 
decision 
hastings has contended that if a white judge had been acquitted 
in the bribery conspiracy case he would not have been subjected to 
impeachment but he said wednesday i do not believe there is a 
racist bone in the body of any member of the united states senate 
sharpton on the other hand said at a news conference with 
hastings it is double jeopardy at best and an outrageous racist 
maneuver to try to deprive us of one of the few black judges in this 
country 
hastings noted the crowd at the news conference and said if 
rev sharpton has been the hook then hallelujah he said he could 
not be judgmental about the source of support as he fights to 
hold onto his judicial post 
sharpton became nationally known as an adviser to tawana brawley 
a black teenager who said she was abducted and molested by a group 
of white men 
the minister advised miss brawley not to cooperate with the new 
york attorney generals investigation of the allegation she did not 
testify and a grand jury later declared the story to be a hoax

president bush proclaiming the iron 
curtain has begun to part on wednesday saluted hungarys strides 
toward economic and political freedom he pledged to open us 
markets to hungarian goods and send the first peace corps volunteers 
ever to a communist country 
his message was greeted with a standing ovation by the students 
of karl marx university of economic sciences where das kapital 
the landmark treatise of the father of communism is no longer 
required reading 
for bush nearing the end of a fourday swing through poland and 
hungary before flying to paris on thursday for the economic summit 
it was another dramatic gesture on his delicate mission of 
encouraging democratic freedoms in the east bloc without 
antagonizing the soviet union 
for the first time the iron curtain has begun to part and 
hungary your great country is leading the way said bush 
standing on a university stage against a backdrop of hungarian and 
american flags 
bush said hungary will soon be granted most favored nation 
trading status by the united states and he announced plans to ask 
congress for 25 million in new aid to spur the hungarians moves 
toward a freemarket economy 
hungarian leaders gave a delighted bush a snippet of the barbed 
wire fence they recently removed from their border with austria a 
barrier that bush said had stood as the ugly symbol of europes 
division and hungarys isolation 
that is just beautiful thats a marvelous symbol of this whole 
visit the president said 
there is no mistaking the fact that we are on the threshold of 
a new era bush said in his speech and there is also mistaking 
the fact that hungary is at the threshold of great and historic 
changes 
imre pozsgay one of hungarys four communist leaders told bush 
the changes in his country were irreversible and he said the 
ruling communists would accept the results of free elections 
scheduled next year and step down if defeated 
it is only the blind and deaf who can neglect the polish 
experience especially that of the recent elections pozsgay told 
reporters 
bushs aid package was similar to the one he presented monday to 
poland with a twist the firstever peace corps volunteers 
dispatched to a communist country 
their aim will be to teach english to hungarians bush said the 
english language is already one of the most popular american 
exports and a key to closing business deals around the world 
the students and professors applauded the offer two years ago 
hungary dropped russian as a compulsory language in the schools 
in this east bloc state long home to thousands of soviet troops 
and arms bush also outlined his hopes for deep cuts in conventional 
arms in europe were working day and night to get a solid 
historic agreement bush said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said later that nato will 
formally present its conventional arms proposal to the warsaw pact 
in vienna on thursday before those talks recess until september 
that is two months early and gives the soviets ample time to 
prepare a reply enhancing bushs goal of achieving a conventional 
arms accord within 12 months baker said 
baker said he expected there would be support among the western 
allies at the paris summit for a package of aid to reward poland and 
hungary for their democratic reforms but no pricetag has been fixed 
in terms of specific commitments how many dollars country x is 
going to commit in that sort of thing no we dont have that yet 
but we will have some substantial discussions when we get to the 
summit about this baker said 
bush also held meetings with hungarian government leaders and 
opposition figures he conferred with student leaders and gave two a 
lift to the university in his limousine after the speech he 
strolled through a nearby market shaking hands and plucking a wad 
of hungarian currency from his pocket to purchase a dozen ripe 
peaches 
bush said hungary would be eligible to trade freely with the 
united states once it enacts legislation later in the year removing 
all barriers to emigration 
that would make hungary the first country to escape restrictions 
imposed under the 1974 jacksonvanik trade law which imposed trade 
barriers on countries that restrict emigration 
hungary is opening again to the west becoming a beacon of 
light in european culture bush said i see people in motion 
color creativity experimentation 
bush said hungary faced the challenge of trying to build a 
structure of political change and decentralized economic enterprise 
on the ruins of a failed stalinist system 
the speech was shown live on hungarian television 
bush did not repeat the calls he made in warsaw for austerity 
measures explaining john sununu the white house chief of staff 
said hungary had taken long strides toward a freemarket system and 
they are quite justifiably proud 
extending another theme from his stop in poland the president 
was serene in his treatment of the soviet union to which the poles 
and hungarians are bound militarily in the warsaw pact 
the soviet leaders know they have everything to gain and 
nothing to lose or fear from peaceful change bush said we can 
work together to move beyond containment beyond the cold war 
the 25 million enterprise fund which requires congressional 
approval would be administered jointly with hungarians it would 
support private sector development through hard currency loans or 
venture capital grants for approved projects 
these could include the establishment of a development bank and 
funds to enable entrepreneurs to buy into hungarian state firms 
bush also said he will ask congress for 5 million to establish 
an environmental center for central and eastern europe based in 
budapest 
the fate of the earth transcends borders it is not just an 
eastwest issue he said 
pozsgay one of the four hungarian government leaders who met 
with bush said the first visit by an american president had 
satisfied the hosts expectations and given new opportunity both 
in the reform of the hungarian economy and the political reform 
opposition leaders said bush stressed to them that the 
multiparty elections now being negotiated for next year should be 
not only free but fair 
balint magyar a representative of the alliance of free 
democrats said they advised bush not to send the kind of american 
help whereby we would have western technology but with eastern 
authoritarianism controlling it

members of congress spent more than 135 
million for overseas travel in 198788 often shunning commercial 
arlines in favor of the militarys more expensive executive 
transport service a study said wednesday 
public citizen an independent congressional watchdog counted 
1053 trips abroad in the twoyear period with house members 
stopping most frequently in west germany france and the united 
kingdom and senators preferring switzerland france and costa rica 
a review of congressional foreign travel reveals that some 
trips appear to be mere junkets with no compelling purpose the 
report entitled free flying congressconcluded 
in the junket category the report said was a journey to five 
countries by four house rules committee members and four panel staff 
members the committee sets rules for floor debate but unlike other 
committees has no role in drafting legislation 
public citizen also questioned the need for a trip by 13 house 
members and seven staffers to australia for seven days to help 
celebrate the centennial of that nations parliament 
the report said it is legitimate for the public to ask congress 
why is the more expensive military transportation used when 
commercial travel is generally available 
the likely answer the report said is that members like the 
convenience of the air forces 89th military airlift wing which has 
most of its planes at andrews air force base in washingtons 
maryland suburbs the wing includes the presidential jets and and 
other aircraft that fly members of congress and top executive branch 
officials around the world 
spouses of members often get free transportation on the overseas 
trips because they dont have to pay when empty seats are available 
on military aircraft that have already been chartered for lawmakers 
because they are not assessed these travel costs spouses and 
other guests are not generally listed in congressional travel 
documents thus making it difficult for constituents to discern when 
family or other guests travel with members the report said 
reporting rules are so inadequate the report added that 
published costs of overseas trips are often underestimated 
the information on members of the 100th congress who served in 
1987 and 1988 was compiled from figures furnished by committees and 
from military records 
altogether 306 house members took 827 trips abroad at a cost of 
at least 115 million the report said while 80 senators went on 
226 trips costing more than 2 million 
the most frequent flier in the house was rep stephen solarz 
dny chairman of the asian and pacific affairs subcommittee of 
the foreign affairs committee he made 14 trips during the twoyear 
period making 39 stops in foreign countries the report said 
other frequent travelers with nine trips were rep george 
crockett dmich chairman of the house foreign affairs western 
hemisphere subcommittee whose trips included 29 stopovers house 
armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis with 20 stops 
and house agriculture chairman e kika del la garza dtexas who 
had 13 stops 
the top senate overseas fliers were christopher dodd dconn 
chairman of the senate foreign relations western hemisphere 
subcommittee with nine trips and 19 stopovers arlen specter 
rpa a member of the intelligence committee with nine trips and 
at least seven stops some of his stopovers were not revealed and 
john mccain rariz a member of the armed services committee with 
eight trips and 10 stops

a senate committee gave partyline approval 
wednesday to a measure by sen edward m kennedy to require american 
employers to provide health insurance to all their workers and their 
workers dependents 
the measure cleared kennedys labor and human resources committee 
on a 97 vote but is strongly opposed by the administration and 
other powerful groups including many business organizations 
coupled with special provisions for children the kennedy bill is 
intended to provide coverage for the estimated 37 million americans 
not now covered by any public or private health insurance 
although many of the details have been reworked the bill is 
similar to one that cleared the committee last year but was not 
considered in either the full senate or house 
kennedy noted that the majority of businesses already insure 
their workers yet twothirds of all the americans who lack basic 
health insurance protection are workers or members of working 
families 
for more than half a century we have required employers to pay 
a minimum wage to participate in social security to contribute to 
unemployment compensation and to purchase workmans compensation 
insurance the massachusetts democrat said at the outset of the 
committee markup session in 1989 it is time to require the 
provision of basic health insurance coverage as well 
labor secretary elizabeth dole arguing against the measure in a 
letter to kennedy said enactment of his bill would result in a 
significant loss of job opportunities impair our nations economic 
competitiveness and interfere with the right of employees and 
employers to determine between themselves the most appropriate 
compensation package to meet their circumstances 
the kennedy bill would require employers to pay at least 80 
percent of the insurance premiums for all employees who work at 
least 25 hours a week and 100 percent for those who do not make at 
least 25 percent above the minimum wage 
although employees would have to pay a larger share of the 
premium the health policy would have to be available to those who 
work between 17 and 25 hours a week 
the insurance package must include hospital care physician care 
diagnostic tests prenatal and wellbaby care and a limited mental 
health benefit deductibles could not exceed 250 per individual or 
500 per family 
among special provisions for small employers is a system of 
regional insurers to take advantage of group rates and a federal 
subsidy for those whose required premiums would exceed 5 percent of 
gross revenues of the business 
moreover small employers with fewer than 10 employees who have 
been in business less than two years would have to offer a lowcost 
insurance plan to their workers but would not have to help pay the 
premium finally the bill would be phased in over a fiveyear 
period for employers with five or fewer workers

bill williams was featured in the film and 
says it humiliates him but vladimir semyonov was also in titicut 
follies and wants the world to see the shocking documentary on a 
hospital for the criminally insane that was banned from general 
viewing after its debut 22 years ago 
williams and semyonov are among former patients at bridgewater 
state hospital interviewed by a guardian as a state judge considers 
a renewed request by awardwinning filmmaker frederick wiseman to 
release his first movie 
the 85 minutes of cinema verite in black and white opened the 
door to what superior court judge harry kalus labeled a nightmare 
of ghoulish obscenities when he banned the film at the states 
request in 1967 on grounds it violated patients privacy rights 
the camera captures bare cells housing often nude men guards 
taunting patients and general chaos one man is shown being force 
fed as he lies on a table and liquid is poured down a rubber hose 
shoved into his nose 
the views of williams semyonov and nearly 20 others are central 
to the case before superior court justice andrew gill meyer who 
said wednesday that he hopes to issue a decision by early next month 
on whether to lift the ban 
the stigma will last to my grave said williams who after 
leaving bridgewater in the 1970s went to college and became a drug 
counselor 
semyonov who lives less than a mile from williams in this gritty 
city 15 miles south of boston feels much differently about the film 
i want bridgewater exposed said semyonov who works in a 
supermarket and champions the mentally ill the building is 
better but the treatment is the same 
the hospital built in 1852 has been replaced with new buildings 
since titicut follies was made in 1966 the movie took its name 
from bridgewaters annual christmas show titicut was the indian 
name for the area 
legal battles over the ban continued for several years in 1969 
the state supreme judicial court upheld the ban on general release 
but allowed its viewing by audiences of professionals such as 
lawyers social workers and psychiatrists 
wiseman a threetime emmy winner renewed his battle in 1987 
saying conditions had deteriorated at bridgewater following 
improvements in the 22 years since the film was made 
case guardian mitchell sikora who interviewed 17 men featured in 
titicut follies still living in massachusetts reported this 
spring that showing it now would not be harmful the state no longer 
opposes its release 
in the documentary semyonov is seen pleading to be sent back to 
the state prison in walpole and arguing that heavy doses of 
antipsychotic drugs are harming him 
semyonov 51 was convicted of participating in a storekeepers 
slaying at age 16 he was sentenced to life at walpole and spent 
nine years there before being sent to bridgewater after complaining 
he was being poisoned 
they thought i was crazy he recalled nobody examined me 
the doctor gave me thorazine 
a social worker took up his case and won his release in 1975 
today semyonov lives in his own apartment he helped established a 
clubhouse in brockton for former psychiatric patients and served on 
the board of the community mental health agency 
im satisfied with myself said semyonov 
williams expressed similar satisfaction life has been good to 
me he said during a conversation in his apartment which is lined 
with bookshelves photographs of his six children and martin luther 
king jr 
williams who is in his late 50s was sent to walpole in his late 
20s accused of a crime he wont talk about a prison fight landed 
him in bridgewater for a black man bridgewater was a dungeon he 
said 
he said it took him five years to win his release from the 
hospital and prison years later while studying at the university 
of massachusetts to be a counselor titicut follies was shown at 
one of his classes despite his pleas to the professor williams said 
he said some classmates subsequently avoided him and others 
seemed interested only in a morbid way i told them nothing he 
said 
williams who fears the films potential effect on his family 
figures the ban will be lifted if thats the case he said he 
hopes showing titicut follies might tell the powers that be 
people are watching you

a politburo member who suffered a humiliating 
defeat in parliamentary elections lost his job as leningrad 
communist party chief wednesday he is the first soviet leader to be 
ousted under popular pressure 
the leningrad party central committees decision to retire yuri 
f solovyov on a pension is a critical step in developing the 
process of democratization of the internal life of the entire 
party said president mikhail s gorbachev who attended the 
meeting 
solovyov also is likely to lose his position as a nonvoting 
member of the partys 20person ruling politburo since he no longer 
holds the leningrad job that put him there 
voters in leningrad the countrys secondlargest city rejected 
virtually their entire party leadership in the march parliamentary 
elections solovyovs defeat was especially embarrassing because he 
ran unopposed and still could not win approval from 50 percent of 
the voters in this city of about 48 million people 
speaking in an extraordinary television interview that included 
both solovyov and successor boris gidaspov gorbachev said the 
decision to change leadership came in response to party members 
dissatisfaction speakers at the committee meeting complained they 
were being left out of political life gorbachev said 
he said the politburo decided he should go to leningrad to 
discuss the situation with local people 
the president who promoted solovyov to the politburo three years 
ago also said the party is behind in its efforts to restructure the 
soviet union 
many things are not being solved in the proper time and this 
is due to the fact that the party itself does not act in time he 
said it lags behind 
gorbachevs statement follows several days of similar comments in 
the soviet press including the communist party newspaper pravda 
after the march election defeat of 12 members of the leningrad 
leadership a poll found 68 percent of the citys residents and 66 
percent of its party members did not believe the current party 
leadership has the ability to radically change the situation in the 
city 
communist activists started a grassroots effort to call a meeting 
of all 600000 party members in leningrad to oust solovyov but 
activist marina salye said in a telephone interview wednesday the 
recall effort won the support of only 11000 and they needed 
200000 to force a special session 
instead solovyovs ouster came at the hands of the leningrad 
central committee a policymaking party group that typically numbers 
several hundred with gorbachev leading the discussion 
solovyov seated nexted to gorbachev in the television interview 
and appearing unruffled said the most important task he leaves for 
his successor is increasing the authority of the party on a 
democratic basis and eliminating its complacency 
in april shortly after solovyovs defeat gorbachev sharply 
reprimanded him at a kremlin meeting for complaining that the party 
had lost its unity and was becoming a discussion club 
solovyovs successor gidaspov is a 56yearold doctor of 
chemistry who was elected to the congress of peoples deputies in 
the parliamentary election defeating more than 20 opponents as the 
head of an enterprise that runs joint ventures of several industries 
without interference from moscow ministries he is a leader in 
economic experimentation 
in the television interview he smiled several times and said his 
election as leningrad party chief over two other nominees came as no 
surprise 
nobody talked to me not in moscow not in the central 
committee not gorbachev he said this is the choice of 
leningraders 
he promised to open discussion of the citys problems to a 
variety of groups including environmentalists he also said 
18thcentury central leningrad now marked by crumbling pastel 
facades should be restored

congress must impose significant federal 
control over childrens television so the medium can be used to 
educate the young sen tim wirth said wednesday 
broadcasters must transform childrens television from a vast 
wasteland to a source of intellectual stimulation and enrichment 
the colorado democrat said in testimony before the senate 
communications subcommittee 
wirth testifying for a bill he authored to condition license 
renewal on broadcasters providing educational shows aimed at 
children said broadcasters seem to have abandoned educational 
childrens programs in the wake of the deregulation frenzy of 
the reagan administration 
today not one of the three major commercial broadcast networks 
offers a single regularly scheduled weekday educational program 
for children he said there is no question about it the 
educational needs of americas children are not being serviced by 
the nations television broadcasters 
wirths bill goes considerably beyond another measure on 
childrens tv introduced by sens howard metzenbaum dohio and 
frank lautenberg dnj 
wirths bill would 
reimpose limits on advertising time in childrens tv shows that 
the federal communications commission repealed in 1984 those limits 
are 95 minutes of commercials per hour on weekends and 12 minutes 
per hour during weekdays 
reclassify socalled programlength commercials as 
advertisements thereby effectively eliminating them 
require broadcasters to give advance public notice of programs 
designed specifically to educate and inform children 
the metzenbaumlautenberg bill is identical to a measure that 
passed congress last year only to be pocketvetoed by president 
reagan a companion measure is before the house 
metzenbaum called childrens television an abomination that 
is truly an embarrassment to our nation 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said his group supported the metzenbaum bill which he 
called a fair and reasonable compromise he called wirths bill 
unwise and unworkable 
fritts said broadcasters are losing young audiences to cable tv 
and vcrs while production costs for kids shows are increasing 
further restrictions and more stringent programming 
requirements run the risk of knocking the childrens television 
marketplace even further out of balance fritts said urging the 
subcommittee to reject wirths bill 
dewitt helm president of the association of national 
advertisers opposed both bills contending the restrictions are 
unconstitutional dont protect children and invite further federal 
advertising curbs 
subcommittee chairman sen daniel inouye dhawaii said congress 
had ample precedent for imposing tv ad restrictions children he 
said were a special audience and called the childrens tv bill the 
most important legislation the panel would consider this year

republican whip new gingrich joined more than 
110 fellow house members wednesday in calling for expanded federal 
child care assistance that concentrates on tax credits rather than 
direct grants 
a democratic bill calling for direct grants has already passed 
the senate 
republican reps clyde holloway of louisiana and dick schulze of 
pennsylvania drafted the new legislation which gingrich said 
brought house republicans to a pretty unified position 
they drafters claim 115 cosponsors including about 20 democrats 
for the bill they introduced wednesday 
the republican measure would expand tax credits for both 
lowerand middleincome parents of children under 4 regardless of 
whether both parents actually work and pay for outside child care 
the democratic bill would made additional federal money available 
to states to make direct payments to day care providers and would 
establish nonbinding federal standards for child care providers 
the senate version widely known as the abc bill was 
primarily the work of sen chris dodd dconn 
gingrich expressed confidence that the gop congressmens 
approach similar to a proposal by president bush can prevail in 
the house if it gets a straight upordown vote in competition with 
the democratic version 
the american people desire to have no procedural games played 
with this said gingrich all were asking for is a straight up 
and down vote 
some democrats have said they would like to see the house child 
care legislation attached to an overall budget reconciliation 
measure a tactical move that could make it difficult to get a 
direct vote on the competing child care bills 
i cant believe the democrats would try to play that game 
said gingrich 
he said the way the child care legislation is handled by house 
leaders an issue not likely to be resolved until early fall will 
be a good measure of house speaker tom foleys stated intention to 
give republican initiatives a fair chance 
gingrich said the republican taxcredit approach is based on the 
premise that parents are inherently better at taking care of their 
children than bureaucrats and that women who choose to stay home 
to care for their young children should not be discriminated against 
he said the abc bill with its emphasis on uniform standards for 
child care providers makes an inherent automatic assumption that 
many parents are too dumb to choose child care for their children

the hopi tribe and a state university signed an 
unusual agreement wednesday making them partners in a drive to 
improve education cultural resources and economic opportunities on 
the tribal reservation 
today we are beginning to work at trying to intertwine our 
culture with the needs of the progressive world ivan sidney 
chief of the insular hopi tribe said at a signing ceremony 
witnessed by interior secretary manuel lujan and other officials 
we want to be selfsufficient sidney said we need a 
helping hand from the federal government but we do not want to be 
totally dependent on the social programs of this country we have 
chosen northern arizona university to help us achieve 
selfsufficiency 
nau is located in flagstaff near the hopi reservation and enrolls 
about 800 american indian students one of the largest enrollments 
in the country 
under the agreement the university and the tribe will work 
together to set up a model elementary school increase child and 
family education services train hopi teachers develop a 
reservationwide tourism plan build a shopping center set up a 
credit association conduct a labor market study and strengthen 
local businesses 
other projects include drafting plans to manage natural 
resources handle solid waste and improve roads establishing 
capital improvement and trust funds building a new hopi museum and 
developing two new cultural centers including restaurants shops and 
motels outside the reservation in winslow and scottsdale 
we dont believe that theres any program like this in 
existence in the country nor has there ever have been said nau 
president eugene hughes were going to be working with them on 
their goals we see it as a very cooperative venture of mutual 
benefit to the hopi and the university 
hughes estimated the firstyear cost of the arrangement which 
takes effect immediately at 500000 sources of money include the 
tribe the university budget private foundations and corporations 
and the federal bureau of indian affairs which already is involved 
in education activities on the reservation 
lujan called the agreement a model that can be used in other 
areas unless those affected set the priorities the program is not 
going to be effective everything i see about this spells success 
this is truly selfdetermination 
asked if the bureau of indian affairs was supposed to be doing 
the types of things identified in the agreement sidney said yes 
but he added we cant wait on bia we have to go forward we 
have to provide direction set up priorities for what we want we 
have not done that until now 
hughes said half of the countrys indians live within 250 miles 
of nau he said the university already has discussed entering into 
similar agreements with the navajo and white mountain apache tribes

the 1989 us wheat harvest is expected to be 
at a fouryear high of 212 billion bushels a 17 percent increase 
over last years droughtbattered crop of 181 billion bushels the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
new production estimates for the first time this season included 
durum and other springplanted wheat in addition to winter 
wheat planted last fall 
the departments agricultural statistics board said the average 
yield based on indications as of july 1 was estimated at 334 
bushels per acre down from 341 bushels last year 
but farmers are expected to have about 635 million acres of 
wheat for harvest this year up from 532 million in 1988 the board 
said 
the usdas first official estimate of 1989 production of corn 
soybeans and some other major springplanted crops will be issued 
aug 10 along with revised figures for wheat 
however the july report did show new figures for 1989 plantings 
of major crops corn plantings were estimated at 658 million acres 
for harvest up from 582 million acres in 1988 and soybeans at 
602 million acres up from 574 million 
cotton plantings were estimated at 105 million acres down 16 
percent from 1988 that was also down 5 percent from a preliminary 
forecast in march 
winter wheat production was estimated at 146 billion bushels 
down 6 percent from 1988 reduced sharply in kansas and some other 
parts of the great plains by lingering effects of last years 
drought it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production 
the kansas wheat crop estimate however was boosted slightly to 
2112 million bushels from the june forecast of 2024 million even 
so it was down by more than a third from last year 
winter wheat fared better in 1988 because most was harvested or 
had matured before the full impact of heat and drought was felt 
durum wheat production was estimated at 1113 million bushels up 
from 448 million in 1988 and other spring wheat was indicated 
at 5441 million bushels compared with 2055 million last year 
reggie wyckoff president of the national association of wheat 
growers said the usda estimate was a little higher than what he 
had expected and that there will be adequate supplies through the 
198990 marketing year if the projections are correct 
but it also shows evidence that there is disaster in many 
areas where wheat yields have tumbled wyckoff said from the 
associations washington office its pretty rough in hard red 
winter wheat areas 
department economists say the decline in wheat supplies since 
last years reduced harvest is having only slight effect on consumer 
food prices which are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7 
percent compared with a 41 percent gain in 1988 
a related supplyanddemand report showed that us wheat 
inventories may total 592 million bushels by the end of the 
marketing year may 31 down from 694 million bushels june 1 
last month when the crop was thought to be smaller analysts 
projected inventories could decline to 500 million bushels next 
spring 
the report showed that wheat prices could average 375 to 410 
per bushel in 198990 down from the range of 380 to 420 
projected in june but still above the 372 average for last season 
wheat exports were projected at around 123 billion bushels down 
from 144 billion bushels in 198889 
corn production based on past trends and the current outlook 
was projected at 745 billion bushels up from last years 
droughtshriveled 492 billion bushels 
but the july corn outlook was down from junes projection of 785 
billion bushels due in part to late plantings in the eastern corn 
belt and continued limited moisture conditions in the west 
the soybean crop was projected at 195 billion bushels unchanged 
from the june forecast and up sharply from 1988 output of 154 
billion bushels the price outlook also was unchanged at 475 to 
625 per bushel compared with an average of 735 in 198889

some european countries are fighting acid rain 
with a tums for the tundra approach dumping massive amounts of 
neutralizing chemicals over forests and lakes but it doesnt help 
the forests much speakers at an international conference on geology 
said wednesday 
thomas paces a scientist with the geological survey agency in 
czechoslovakia said in his country miles of dying spruce forests 
that receive acid rain are being treated with tons of calcium 
citrate a type of lime dumped from helicopters 
we are spreading tons of calcium citrate per hectare said 
paces a delegate to the 28th international geological congress 
but recovery of the forests has been very poor 
paces said the major problem in his country and in poland and 
hungary is sulfur oxides in the atmosphere from the burning of coal 
the oxides combine with water falling as rain or snow and adding 
acidity to the soil 
paces said thousands of acres of spruce forests are dying 
you can see spruce forests on mountains turning yellow he 
said large areas of spruce are deforested today due to acid 
rain 
more than a century of emissions from coalburning plants in 
europe said paces has slowly caused the soil to turn acidic and is 
now taking its toll on plants 
the damage goes unseen for many many years he said by 
the time you can see it in trees its very difficult to correct 
the problems go on for many many years 
using lime to battle the acid problems is not a good solution 
said paces noting it is very very expensive and it has to be 
repeated every four years 
though some theories have been put forward to account fo acidic 
damage most us forest scientists are not convinced that acidity 
itself harms trees directly though other forms of common air 
pollution do sulfur oxides themselves are highly toxic and kill 
trees on direct impact in high concentrations 
owen p bricker of the us geological survey said that liming 
has been tried to a limited degree in this country but he warned 
that treating acid rain problems with neutralizing chemicals is 
addictive once youve started youve got to keep doing up 
most us liming has been aimed at reducing the acidity of lakes 
receiving acid rain 
bricker said sweden is now spending 10 million a year to add 
lime to some 5000 lakes 
paces bricker and others attending the conference said the only 
true solution to acid rain is to reduce or eliminate the emissions 
that cause it 
in central europe said paces acid rain should be reduced 
sharply in 30 years when the supply of coal runs out 
bricker said that the test stations established on streams in the 
us northeast have shown that the natural aquatic systems recover 
quickly when sulfuric acid falling on them is reduced 
bricker said there remains in the us a need to understand more 
thoroughly how geology affects the acid rain problem 
some rock formations such as limestone will neutralize the 
acidic rainfal naturally while other rock types such as quartz and 
granite react very little as a result said bricker water passing 
through quartz and granite formations would tend to create more acid 
lakes and streams 
local geology is complex and can have great effect on the 
amount of environmental damage caused by acid rain said bricker 
and this is not now being taken into account by federal government 
studies of the nations acid rain problems

government rather than the chemical industry 
should track the half a million daily shipments of hazardous 
materials over the nations roadways the chief sponsor of a bill 
supported by the nations firefighters said wednesday 
another congressman said however that the relatively low number 
of fatalities injuries and property losses may not justify 
proposals that could cost the chemical and trucking industries 
hundreds of millions of dollars a year 
the house public works and transportation subcommittee on surface 
transportation is considering changes in the law to increase 
training requirements for drivers make regulations more uniform 
from state to state and keep track of all hazardous cargo with a 
nationwide computer system 
rep douglas applegate dohio said the bill he is sponsoring 
would shift control of hazardous materials shipments sometimes 
abbreviated on road signs as hazmat from the chemical industry 
to federal state and local governments 
we believe this shift is vital to protect the health and safety 
of our constituents and our communities applegate said 
a 1980 agreement between the transportation department and 
chemical manufacturers set up an industryrun system called chemical 
transportation emergency center or chemtrec it gives local police 
firefighters and others a number to call for information on 
hazardous cargo so they will know how to handle various chemicals in 
an accident 
but applegate said the answering service is useful only when 
the materials involved are known and this may be difficult at the 
site of a crash where chemicals have spilled out and the vehicle is 
smashed or ablaze 
he said placards required on trucks carrying hazardous materials 
often are missing or incorrect and the transportation departments 
emergency response guidebook is not always up to date 
the chemtrec system said applegate is totally inadequate to 
protect the american public 
but rep bud shuster rpenn ranking minority member of the 
subcommittee said hazardous cargo hauls were involved in only 17 of 
the 48200 traffic fatalities in 1988 and 158 of the nearly 700000 
injuries 
shuster questioned whether the hundreds of millions of dollars 
that might be collected from shippers or others under proposed 
legislation were needed 
clifford j harvison president of the national tank truck 
carriers said the tank truck industry supports legislation that 
would make laws more uniform regarding hazardous materials 
trucks cross thousands of jurisdictional boundaries daily and 
carriers cannot tailor the equipment and operational characteristics 
of each truck and driver to meet the singular requirements of a 
given community harvison said 
frederick h nesbitt of the international association of fire 
fighters said a system is needed to give emergency personnel quick 
information about any hazardous cargo involved in an accident 
the unnecessary dangers our firefighters face every day due to 
an antiquated reporting system are inexcusable in this age of high 
technology nesbitt said

nasa preparing to celebrate the 20th 
anniversary of its greatest achievement lost another top official 
wednesday because of an ethics law that takes effect next week 
robert o aller head of the office of space operations was the 
ninth highlevel official to resign this year and the third to say 
publicly he is leaving because of the law 
frankly its so vague and undefined that im not aware of 
anybody in government or on capitol hill or in industry that really 
understands its implications aller said for one that had 
planned at some point in time to go into private industry it almost 
insists that you resign before the 16th of july 
the law aimed at curtailing the revolving door personnel 
relationship between some federal agencies and private industry 
goes into effect sunday it has been postponed once 
the rules will bar federal contractors from hiring government 
officials who have supervised their competitors projects 
aller joined the national aeronautics and space administration in 
1964 and was deeply involved in the apollo moon program which 
culminated july 20 1969 in mans first footfall on another 
heavenly body 
nasa celebrations of that anniversary are expected to include a 
call by president bush for a revitalized space program perhaps 
including a goal of landing on mars or colonizing the moon 
nasas announcement said aller accelerated his departure 
because of the vague new postgovernment employee regulations and 
because of many disappointments in the treatment of government 
employees 
among those disappointments aller said is the pay cap imposed 
for several years on members of the senior executive service of 
which aller is a member president bush last week proposed a 
substantial pay increase for the service 
john logsdon a space analyst at george washington university in 
washington recently characterized the law as a sledgehammer 
instead of a scalpel it was supposed to be 
william f ballhaus jr has resigned effective saturday as 
director of nasas ames research center nasa said ballhaus cited 
inadequate compensation and vague new postgovernment 
employment regulations as factors in his decision to leave after 
18 years 
nasas no 3 official noel hinners resigned effective may 14 a 
day before the new law had been expected to take effect citing 
uncertainty in interpretation of new postemployment laws 
the resignations added to the management problems facing nasas 
administrator richard h truly who has been in that job less than 
two weeks 
truly became acting administrator after the no 1 and no 2 men 
in the agency james c fletcher and dale d myers resigned in the 
spring 
john thomas who was in charge of the effort to redesign the 
space shuttles solid rocket boosters at the marshall space flight 
center resigned to work as an executive in the lockheed space 
operations co at the kennedy space center 
the other resignations were e ray tanner deputy director of 
space station operations in june after only five months on the job 
james odom associate administrator for space station in april 
after a year and thomas l moser acting associate administrator 
for space station for less than a month when he left in may

a highway safety group and relatives of victims 
of a new york bridge collapse asked a court wednesday to block 
federal efforts to double the allowable time between bridge 
inspections 
less frequent bridge inspections mean more chances for bridge 
collapses said gerald donaldson a spokesman for the center for 
auto safety in announcing the lawsuit he said the federal highway 
administration is trifling with the lives of millions of 
americans 
the target of the lawsuit filed in us district court for the 
district of columbia seeks to invalidate a rule issued in august 
1988 by the fhwa 
the rule affecting some 122000 bridges nationwide allows 
states to apply for exemptions from the mandatory twoyear 
inspection cycle meaning the bridges are checked every four years 
instead 
kansas pennsylvania south dakota texas and washington have 
already sought to exempt more than 15000 bridges in those states 
the center said 
the suit argues that in making the new rule the fhwa failed to 
properly consider and evaluate the safety impact of the proposed 
changes and furthermore based its decision upon an invalid 
analysis of the regulations economic benefits 
it also charges that the agency failed to provide a reasoned 
basis for deciding to permit inspections every four years 
an fwha spokesman did not immediately return a phone call seeking 
comment on the lawsuit 
coplaintiffs are virginia hughes of troy ny whose husband 
donald was killed in the 1987 bridge collapse on the new york state 
thruway and william peck of schuylerville ny whose wife mary 
louise and daughter kristen died in the accident 
in january the center and the relatives filed a petition with 
the fhwa asking it to reconsider the rule a letter accompanying the 
petition pointed out that the national transportation safety board 
which also opposed the new rule cited insufficient state inspection 
practices as a major contributing factor to the collapse of the 
thruway bridge 
that span fell into the schoharie creek on april 5 1987 killing 
10 people a year later the chairman of the ntsb made an urgent 
call for highway bridge inspections noting that 43000 of the 
nations bridges had not been inspected within two years as required

a financier and a retired general said 
they devised an elaborate scheme to trick ferdinand marcos into 
signing over billions in embezzled funds but the plan fell when the 
government reneged on the deal 
the businessman michael de guzman and retired brig gen jose 
almonte director of the economic intelligence and investigation 
bureau testified on their scheme before a house of representatives 
committee 
they said their 1986 plan called operation big bird could 
have retrieved billions from secret swiss bank accounts held by the 
former president and his associates de guzman said marcos swiss 
accounts were worth at least 7 billion 
in testimony monday before the house committee on public 
accountability de guzman said he would have transferred the money 
to the philippine government for a 20 percent fee 
but he said the government sabotaged the plan by doublecrossing 
them at the last minute 
de guzman said justice secretary sedfrey ordonez and senate 
president jovito salonga sabotaged the plan 
on wednesday ordonez released a statement saying he opposed the 
scheme because de guzmans vienna bank which would have received 
the money was insolvent 
de guzman said the scheme was hatched in march 1986 one month 
after marcos was ousted from power during meetings in beirut 
lebanon with undisclosed figures allegedly familiar with both swiss 
banking regulations and marcos finances 
de guzman said that on march 20 1986 marcos son ferdinand 
bongbong marcos jr authorized him to transfer funds from 
frozen swiss accounts to the financiers vienna bank marcos who 
was being watched by american agents could not perform the 
operation himself 
de guzman said he got backing for his plan from jose cojuangco 
president corazon aquinos brother and other prominent figures 
accompanied by philippine officials including ordonez he flew to 
switzerland where he presented the letters of authority from marcos 
and received a list of the former presidents deposits 
he said the swiss agreed to a selective unfreezing of accounts 
worth 213 million but before a crucial final meeting de guzman 
said ordonez left switzerland unexpectedly along with the 
philippine governments swiss lawyers 
he learned later that the group had telexed swiss authorities not 
to deposit the money in de guzmans bank but in an account in credit 
suisse in zurich 
the delays and apparent confusion enabled marcos to learn of the 
plan and formally challenge the original letter of authority de 
guzman said 
swiss officials then decided to continue the freeze which 
remains in effect he said

a woman pleaded innocent wednesday to 
murder charges in her 6weekold daughters suffocation death nearly 
three years after her first baby girl died under almost identical 
circumstances 
circuit judge edward ferguson told paula sims she could be 
sentenced to death if convicted of two firstdegree murder charges 
in the death of daughter heather lee whose body was found in a 
trash can may 3 
mrs sims 30 told authorities that masked gunmen abducted 
heather and 13dayold loralei marie who died in 1986 while her 
husband was at work witnesses have said mrs sims had wanted sons 
and was unhappy with daughters 
the madison county grand jury which indicted mrs sims on 
tuesday said it was weighing whether to charge her 37yearold 
husband robert 
mrs sims wearing a baggy orange jail jumpsuit and wrist and 
ankle shackles was somber during the 15minute hearing in this 
county seat nearly 30 miles northeast of st louis 
defense attorney donald groshong entered a written plea and 
asked that bail be set for mrs sims who has been held in the 
madison county jail since her arrest tuesday night at her parents 
house in nearby cottage hills 
ferguson refused to set bond for mrs sims who had been free on 
350000 bail on other charges stemming from the deaths a formal 
arraignment will probably come next week the judge said 
mrs sims has already been accused of hiding the babies deaths 
and lying to investigators she has been charged in madison county 
and neighboring jersey county with obstruction of justice and 
concealing a homicide 
the trial of the jersey county case has been postponed until next 
month those charges stem from loraleis death 
i hope they find out the truth in both cases said bonnie 
trail a former neighbor of the simses in alton two babies in 
three years god 
heathers body was found across the mississippi river from the 
familys home four days after mrs sims reported her abducted 
loralei vanished 13 days after her birth skeletal remains 
believed to be those of the child were found a few days later about 
150 yards from the sims home 
that death remains unsolved authorities have said the simses are 
the main suspects 
tuesday indictment came after the grand jury heard more than four 
hours of testimony from mrs sims parents nylene and orville blew 
they were ordered to testify after being granted immunity from 
prosecution 
states attorney william haine said other evidence made the 
states case the physical evidence was very important he said 
but did not elaborate 
haine said no decision has been made on whether to seek the death 
penalty 
the first murder count alleges that mrs sims intended to kill 
heather and the second alleges she committed an act she knew had the 
strong possibility of ending in death or great bodily harm 
the simses also have a 17month old son randy who was placed in 
the custody of the state department of children and family services 
during the investigation of heathers death

in a setback for the bush administration the 
senate foreign relations committee on wednesday shelved a bid to 
give us weapons to the noncommunist opposition in cambodia 
after that decision and several others the panel voted 170 to 
report to the senate floor a bill authorizing 116 billion in 
foreign aid for the next two fiscal years a period beginning next 
oct 1 
the panel took no action on the cambodia plan after several 
democrats voiced fears that any arms provided might find their way 
into the hands of the khmer rouge the cambodian faction blamed for 
the deaths of at least one million people when it held power during 
the 1970s 
the move by the committee does not necessarily kill the proposal 
senators said it might be renewed in the form of an amendment on the 
senate floor or during a conference with the house on its version of 
foreign aid authorization legislation 
the committee also voted to impose a 90 million cap on us 
military aid for the government of el salvador a move intended to 
symbolize fears that rightwing death squad activity might be 
renewed under that nations newly elected conservative government 
the action sparked a brief debate in which sen jesse helms 
rnc said the senate action would encourage communist insurgents 
inside el salvador 
the bush administrations plan to begin arming noncommunist 
forces in cambodia opened up deep divisions in the committee and in 
congress generally fanning memories of the us involvement in the 
war in vietnam 
the situation is complicated by the fact that prince norodom 
sihanouk the former cambodian leader has joined a loose alliance 
of various cambodian factions including the khmer rouge the 
combined aim of the coalition is to oust the government of hun san 
which was installed by occupying vietnamese forces 
the administrations position was backed by sen charles robb 
dva who offered an amendment authorizing the president to make 
military aid available to noncommunist resistance forces and 
noncommunist civilians in cambodia 
robb said his amendment was designed to facilitate the 
withdrawal of the vietnamese from cambodia and to prevent the khmer 
rouge from regaining power by arming their opponents 
but other members objected that the funding provided by the 
amendment was openended and expressed concern that sihanouk is an 
unreliable and mercurial ally 
i feel the preponderance of the evidence makes it unwise to 
proceed with the robb amendment at this time said sen alan 
cranston dcalif it authorizes virtually unlimited military 
assistance to a resistance force that is allied with the khmer 
rouge 
in the end robb dropped his proposal 
on el salvador sen christopher dodd dconn first proposed 
capping military aid at 85 million last years level he agreed to 
a 5 million increase 
helms told the committee the enemy in el salvador is the 
communist insurgency there not the conservative government of 
president alfredo cristiani 
by your vote on this amendment you indicate which way you 
stand helms said 
dodd replied to say that because you favor an 85 million cap 
you favor marxism is ludicrous no one on this committee favors 
marxism 
he said the idea of a limit on military spending is to send a 
signal that a return to widespread human rights abuses in el 
salvador will not be tolerated 
there are elements that would like to go back to the days where 
you could go around that country and pick out people for 
assassination dodd said 
the committee voted 118 to leave the cap on military aid in the 
bill it then approved the higher 90 million level by voice vote

georgias supreme court blocked the execution 
wednesday of murderer son fleming an hour after a parole board ruled 
that his low iq doesnt entitle him to leniency 
elsewhere a federal judge in birmingham ala refused to halt 
fridays execution of horace franklin dunkins jr rejecting claims 
that the jury should have been allowed to consider dunkins 
retardation in deciding whether to impose the death penalty 
the cases follow a us supreme court ruling in june that the 
constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not bar 
states from executing killers who are retarded 
in the georgia case the court in a 43 vote granted an 
indefinite stay of execution five hours before fleming was to die in 
the electric chair and an hour after the board of pardons and 
paroles denied clemency 
fleming 59 was convicted with two other men in the 1976 murder 
of police chief ed giddens of ray city who was shot to death and 
his body dumped in a swamp after he stopped a car matching one used 
in a robbery 
in their appeal flemings lawyers cited a 1988 georgia law that 
says a defendants mental condition can be considered in some cases 
when applying the death penalty however the law doesnt apply 
retroactively to cases like flemings 
his iq scores range from 64 to 72 a person with an iq of 70 is 
considered mentally handicapped 
philosophically i dont want to see mentally retarded people 
executed but my job and oath is to see that the law is carried 
out said attorney general michael bowers he said he made no 
recommendation to the parole board 
pardons and paroles chairman wayne snow said the board rejected 
flemings appeal on grounds that fleming was aware of the 
consequences of his actions despite his low iq 
we wanted the decision to reflect what the us supreme court 
and others have said in this case snow said we had to look at 
the deliberate action on the part of the person and we had to look 
at their understanding of good and of evil and the consequences to 
it 
in the alabama case defense attorney steve ellis argued that the 
us supreme court ruling requires that a jury consider a 
defendants retardation in weighing imposition of the death penalty 
ellis said that was not done at dunkins 1981 trial 
us district judge james hancock denied a stay of execution 
ruling that that even if jurors didnt consider dunkins mental 
condition the judge did 
and thats whats important since the judge is the one who 
actually sentenced him to die in alabamas electric chair he said 
dunkins is scheduled to be electrocuted at 1201 am friday his 
appeal now proceeds to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta 
a jury convicted dunkins in 1981 of murder in the rape and 
slaying of lynn mccurry a 26yearold mother of four from warrior 
she was found in 1980 tied to a tree near her home with surgical 
tape and stabbed 66 times

the rev jesse l jackson will move to the 
district of columbia next month but he remains undecided about 
whether to run for mayor of the nations capital jackson aides said 
wednesday 
the sources confirmed that jackson will take up a temporary 
residence in an apartment building in northwest washington by the 
first week of august while renovation work is completed on a home he 
owns 
by moving to the apartment house jackson can switch his voter 
registration to the district easily meeting an election law 
deadline that requires mayoral candidates to have lived in 
washington for at least one year prior to the balloting the next 
mayoral election is scheduled for november 1990 
however the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
said jackson has not yet committed to running for mayor 
i talked to him recently about running for mayor and he said 
im still praying about it 
jackson was traveling from chicago to detroit on wednesday and 
could not be reached for comment 
jacksons advisors remain divided about whether the twotime 
democratic presidential hopeful should try for the mayors job in 
washington 
some advisors feel it would give jackson the handson political 
experience his detractors say he lacks while others fear that he 
could become bogged down with the problems of running an urban 
government and tarnish his national image 
to further complicate his mayoral decision jackson has 
repeatedly said he would never run against mayor marion barry a 
friend and ally from the civil rights movement 
barry under federal investigation for his ties to a drug suspect 
and struggling with city budget woes has not said publicly whether 
he will seek an unprecedented fourth term 
jacksons move also is timed to coincide with relocation of the 
offices of the national rainbow coalition from chicago to the 
nations capital while the rainbow coalition offices are set to 
open by sept 1 the sources said jackson plans to keep his 
residence in chicago 
in addition jackson wants to be based in washington to more 
effectively work on a drive to gain statehood for the nations 
capital the sources said

the house voted wednesday to eliminate 45000 
from the national endowment of the arts budget as punishment for 
helping fund artworks that desecrate religious articles and show 
explicitly homosexual imagery 
the move proposed by rep charles stenholm dtexas was 
approved 36165 as an amendment to the 11 billion interior 
appropriations bill it was an alternative to two other proposals by 
members of congress who were outraged at the nea 
stenholm said he was concerned about the way the endowment was 
moving on certain taxpayer funded projects and wanted to send a 
political message that the endowment had to be sensitive to the 
general public concern 
a measure offered by rep dana rohrabacher rcalif would have 
wiped out the neas entire 1442 million appropriation another was 
proposed by rep richard armey rtexas would have cut the nea 
budget by 10 percent 
the fight centered on a photograph by andres serrano of a plastic 
crucifix submerged in a container of amber liquid later identified 
as the artists urine and an exhibition of photographs by robert 
mapplethorpe that included depiction of homoeroticism child nudity 
and sadomasochism 
the nea gave the institute of contemporary art at the university 
of pennsylvania 30000 to display the mapplethorpe works and the 
southeastern center for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
70000 from which it awarded serrano a 15000 prize 
the serrano award also included funds from the equitable 
foundation and the rockefeller foundation said josh dare spokesman 
for the nea 
stenholm said he did not see his measure as censorship but 
armey whose opposition to the art works led to the floor fight 
disagreed 
the stenholm effort was censorship by reprisal specifically 
and clearly confined to instances said armey my effort was 
designed to give a very large slug on the head to a stubborn mule 
to say procedurely and systemically youve got to change your 
attitude and change your behavior 
armey referred called the arts endowment arrogant and it was 
not in compliance with standards of taste decency sensitivity 
tolerance 
rep ted weiss dny who opposed all three plans said they 
take a piece out of america and what america is about and that is 
freedom of expression 
rep george miller dcalif said it was a disgrace for this 
body to be considering these amendments

local television stations not just cable tv 
networks are increasing the number of major league baseball games 
they carry a cable tv group said wednesday in disputing claims that 
cable companies are stealing baseball from free tv 
local broadcast coverage of professional baseball has grown by 
nearly 40 percent over the past 15 years from 1190 games in 1975 
to 1647 games in 1989 the national cable television association 
said 
since 1985 the number of baseball games televised by both local 
broadcast stations and by regional cable sports networks has 
increased 7 percent the ncta said 
as a result cables baseball coverage has served to 
supplement rather than reduce the number of games aired by local 
broadcasters the cable association said in a report 
availability of baseball games on broadcast and cable television 
it said some broadcasters have contended that baseball on cable 
has reduced the number of games carried by local television stations 
complaints about oncefree sports television going to cable have 
not fallen on deaf ears in congress rep norman lent rny in 
may introduced a bill covering sports on cable because of a contract 
dispute that blacked out telecasts of new york yankees baseball 
games to 400000 cable subscribers in the new york city area 
lents bill would allow local authorities to make carriage of 
local tv and sports broadcasts part of a franchising agreement 
the dispute over the yankees games was settled earlier this month 
between madison square garden network and cablevision systems corp 
but only after the new york state assembly passed a bill requiring 
cable companies to pay a fine to customers when it pulls previously 
guaranteed programs 
earlier this year espn became the first basic national cable 
network to obtain rights to major league baseball since usa 
networks contract expired in 1982 espn will carry 175 games per 
season beginning in 1990 
abctv and nbctv have carried between 37 games and 40 games per 
season since the early 1980s and they will air 40 regular season 
games this year the cable association said beginning in 1990 
however cbs will have the rights and it will air only 12 regular 
season games 
the ncta study said local stations will televise about 40 percent 
of all baseball games in 1989 up from 36 percent of all games in 
1985 it said major league franchises have granted tv rights to 16 
of 29 regional cable sports networks for 1989 
between 1985 and 1989 14 of the 26 major league baseball teams 
made more games available for local broadcast coverage seven 
maintained their level of broadcast coverage and four decreased 
their rights agreements with local tv stations ncta said 
at the same time eight teams increased the number of games for 
regional cable network coverage

the bush administration and prominent american 
jewish leaders are urging israeli politicians to preserve their 
coalition government to prevent the collapse of peace efforts 
israeli officials said wednesday 
a newspaper quoted sources in the likud bloc as saying washington 
was meddling in israeli politics but a us official denied such 
interference 
in the occupied west bank soldiers shot and killed a masked 
palestinian teenager who threw stones at an israeli bus an army 
spokesman said 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under standing rules 
said soldiers chased the youth and opened fire after he refused to 
stop he said another arab was arrested 
since the palestinian revolt began 19 months ago 559 
palestinians and 35 israelis have been killed 
arab reports said arab attackers wednesday shot and wounded a 
42yearold palestinian woman suspected of cooperating with israeli 
authorities the attackers also beat her husband the reports said 
also wednesday israeli troops shot and wounded 11 palestinians 
including a 3yearold girl 
the defense ministry meanwhile said the army will reopen the 
1200 west bank schools that have been closed for most of the 
uprising 
the army announcement gave no date but israel radio said defense 
minister yitzhak rabin was considering starting classes within 10 
days 
the united states repeatedly has asked that the 300000 
palestinian students be allowed to continue their educations 
usisraeli relations have been strained by the decision of 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc to harden its stand on 
middle east peace negotiations 
the leftofcenter labor party of vice premier shimon peres has 
threatened to quit the coalition in protest 
its true that the americans are asking us to wait a little bit 
and see whether the peace initiative can be saved said a labor 
source close to peres 
the conservative newspaper maariv quoted likud sources as saying 
the bush administration has committed vulgar political 
interference in israels internal politics it cited a message 
reportedly sent via us ambassador william brown urging labor to 
stay in the government 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher 
described such reports as blatantly absurd were not getting 
involved in israels domestic political issues he said 
assistant secretary of state john h kelly made similar comments 
but he also said he believes hardliners are damaging prospects for 
palestinian elections in the occupied lands kelly the state 
departments top middle east official was testifying before the 
house foreign affairs subcommittee on europe and the middle east 
labor party sources said washington may downgrade a delegation to 
visit israel next week that was to have been led by deputy secretary 
of state lawrence eagleburger 
kelly denied the delegations mission is to persuade the 
coalition partners to stay together and said it will discuss 
prospects for israelipalestinian negotiations 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said the prime minister will 
stress to the us delegation that the hardline decisions are not 
binding on the cabinet which approved the peace plan by 20 votes to 
six on may 14 
they will hear that the peace initiative exists untouched with 
not a single comma changed ahimeir said 
labor wont make its decision about leaving the government until 
early august but sources predicted it will be difficult for shamir 
to restore credibility to his peace proposals 
ahimeir said two prominent jewish leaders fundraiser max fisher 
of detroit and seymour reich of new york chairman of the conference 
of presidents of major jewish organizations called the premier to 
urge a continuation of the coalition 
shamir does not need pressure since he believes the national 
unity government should be continued said ahimeir noting likud 
cabinet ministers earlier urged labor to stay in the government 
the liberal american jewish committee sent a letter tuesday to 
shamir demanding the likud leader show in words and deeds his 
commitment to the plan to start the negotiating process with 
elections in the occupied territories 
on july 5 shamir accepted likud hawks demands that appeared to 
severely limit his flexibility in selling the plan to palestinians 
these included barring 140000 east jerusalem arabs from 
participating ruling out a palestinian state endorsing new jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and ending the 
uprising a precondition for elections 
harry wall director of the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith in israel said many us jews fear new elections could bring 
an extreme rightwing government to power and raise again the who 
is a jew issue 
they fear small ultraorthodox parties would seek a law requiring 
all conversions meet orthodox criteria alienating reform and 
conservative sects that predominate in the united states

a new york agency that allegedly oversold 
millions of dollars worth of drought insurance to farmers in 10 
states claimed wednesday it only was acting on the orders of the 
insurer chubb insurance of new jersey 
james ringer representing chubb contended in opening arguments 
in us district court that good weather international corp was 
an agent that went wild and did enormous harm to the farmers and 
to chubb 
chubb is seeking 77 million in damages and some 8800 farmers in 
10 states have asked 20 million plus punitive damages chubb 
already has agreed to pay the farmers 53 million in an earlier 
outofcourt settlement 
good weather of long island ny and fresno calif is owned 
by henry cox the company sold drought insurance for chubb in 1987 
and 1988 
good weather was not acting as an insurance company in this 
case but as an insurance brokerage said defense attorney james 
moore he said good weather and its agents sold the insurance on the 
orders and guidance of chubb 
you dont sell what you dont have ringer said 
chubb contended good weather violated its contract with chubb by 
selling more than the available number of crop insurance policies 
chubb contends it lost at least 75 million because of the action 
and for lawyers fees to defend itself in the resulting lawsuits 
the lawsuit represents farmers in ohio illinois iowa kentucky 
indiana tennessee minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin 
stanley chesley representing the farmers told the eightmember 
jury in his opening statement wednesday that good weather knowingly 
oversold the policies hoping they would not have to pay off 
he said the 20 million and damages demanded by the farmers would 
make up the losses they suffered when the policies did not pay off 
the farmers said they suffered emotional distress in being denied 
the drought insurance and sustained crop losses as well as losses 
from not being given interest on the money they invested in the 
insurance 
the money sought is in addition to the 53 million chubb 
settlement which rubins special master cincinnati lawyer lawrence 
kane jr has been distributing since march 
the trial is expected to take about two weeks court officials 
said

the commerce department said wednesday that it 
was easing security rules on the sale of up to 30 billion worth of 
goods a year to 18 large trading countries 
the rules are designed to keep strategic products out of the 
hands of the soviet union and its allies 
the countries affected by the change are belgium luxembourg 
canada denmark west germany france greece italy japan the 
netherlands norway portugal spain turkey britain australia 
switzerland and finland 
all but switzerland and finland are us allies and members of 
the coordinating committee on multilateral export controls a 
semisecret organization in paris 
us authorities said switzerland and finland had adopted control 
systems effective enough to be included in the new rules though they 
do not belong to the paris group 
goods affected are those that can be used for civilian or 
military purposes and include most kinds of computers telephone 
switching equipment and some machine tools 
commerce department licenses will no longer be required to export 
those goods nor will the 18 governments have to ask us permission 
to reexport the goods to one another they still will have to ask 
permission to sell the goods to countries not in the group 
approval will also still be needed for trade within the group of 
some items such as supercomputers and eavesdropping equipment 
us exporters have long complained about the time and paperwork 
needed to get export licenses especially when other governments 
permitted similar goods to be sold freely

the conservative national action party swept 
state elections for governor and the legislature in baja california 
handing the governing party its biggest upset in 60 years according 
to returns wednesday 
in the race for mayors and city halls national action candidates 
tied with the governing institutional revolutionary party known as 
pri taking tijuana and ensenada the pri won in mexicali and tecate 
the returns released by the state election board showed that 
national action took eight of 15 seats in the baja california 
legislature in july 2 balloting 
four more seats were distributed through proportional 
representation among four small leftist parties to ensure a minority 
voice in the legislature 
last week the pri formally conceded defeat to the national 
action candidate for governor of baja california ernesto ruffo 
ruffo takes office nov 1 for a sixyear term 
this is no time to look for blame pri state coordinator rene 
trevino arredondo said in a news release 
it was the first time the pri has lost an election for a govenor 
or a state legislature since the party was founded in 1929 
we lacked electoral strength among the voters we have to 
accept that trevino said we must learn from our mistakes so as 
not to repeat them and we must work hard and with a clear strategy 
so that what happened in baja california should not happen 
elsewhere 
the elections in baja california and four other states and a 
state election in durango on wednesday were seen as a test of 
president carlos salinas de gortaris promise to clean up mexicos 
fraudridden election system salinas own election in july 1988 was 
marred by accusations of irregularities 
long delays by election boards in making returns public have 
again raised opposition cries of fraud 
in western michoacan state leaders of both the leftist 
democratic revolutionary party national action and the pri filed 
protests accusing each other of fraud in at least eight districts 
in that state final returns released by the election board 
wednesday showed no clear majority there was a 1212 tie between 
pri and the combined opposition in the state legislature 
according to the returns the pri won 12 seats the democratic 
revolutionary party six national action two and the leftist 
authentic revolutionary and popular socialist parties two each 
the voter turnout was only 28 percent the election board said 
pri easily won the legislative races in zacatecas and campeche 
two of its strongholds and was also expected to win a majority of 
the 39 races for mayor and the 15 legislature seats in durango where 
it is also strong 
ten more seats are distributed among five minority parties in 
proportion to votes received 
in durango most of the states 1488 polling stations opened on 
schedule at 8 am workers were given the day off and turnout was 
reported strong among the 709000 registered voters 
its a holiday and all is peaceful said ruben cardenas 
editor of cima a newspaper in the rural state only seven polling 
stations opened about an hour late because they didnt receive 
ballots and other documents on time 
national action hoped to win eight municipal elections 
the democratic revolutionary party said it hoped to win seven 
municipal elections four other small leftist parties also were 
competing 
the economy of landlocked durango where john hustons film the 
treasure of the sierra madre was filmed depends on timber

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who has 
favored limiting drought relief to winter wheat appeared wednesday 
to open the door to aid farmers of other weatherdamaged crops 
some southern crops including rice and cotton have been 
devastated by flooding this year and drought damage to 
springplanted crops elsewhere in the country is still being 
assessed yeutter said after a meeting with senate republican leader 
robert dole and several other gop senators 
this is a fluid situation and legislation is not being 
finalized at this point yeutter said 
the bush administration has threatened to veto a drought relief 
package approved by the house that would provide more than 900 
million to farmers facing crop losses from severe weather this year 
yeutter had agreed with dole that relief to this years crops 
should be limited to crops planted in 1988 and damaged by drought 
primarily winter wheat the house measure and legislation 
introduced in the senate tuesday by sens kent conrad dnd and 
tom harkin diowa would provide assistance for crops planted this 
year 
the senate agriculture committee is scheduled to vote on drought 
legislation next week in a letter yeutter sent to the house in 
june he said he would recommend that president bush sign a drought 
relief bill only if it was targeted to 1989 crops affected by 
drought that meant mainly winter wheat according to an aide 
yeutter said wednesday crops in the south had been severely 
damaged by flooding and that drought damage to springplanted crops 
is being assessed almost on a daytoday basis 
when we first discussed the issues that are involved here the 
primary concern was drought it was basically winter wheat and 
livestock producers in terms of damage that has already occurred 
thats still the case with the exception of the severe flooding 
he said 
after the meeting with yeutter dole said senators and the 
administration were trying to agree on drought legislation that 
takes care of those farmers who have a demonstrated loss he 
did not elaborate 
earlier wednesday north dakota gov george sinner declared a 
statewide drought disaster the first step in making farmers 
eligible for federal assistance 
sinner said in a statement that he hoped the declaration would 
also call attention to north dakotas plight a north dakota state 
university study estimates farmers could lose at least 541 million 
in small grains and hay crops as a result of a deepening drought 
the us department of agriculture estimated the government would 
save 950 million in farm program payments to winter wheat growers 
because wheat prices are high 
but doles staff said he sees a shrinking window of 
opportunity for funding winter wheat drought aid because the 
agriculture department is expected to revise those savings downward 
to between 300 million and 350 million 
conrad said the savings will be higher and that spring crop 
program payments will provide additional savings

british commuters suffered travel misery wednesday 
for the fourth time in as many weeks with all trains and the citys 
subway halted by a 24hour strike 
millions of commuters had to find other ways to work and most 
took to the roads creating huge traffic jams and frazzled nerves 
it was the fourth nationwide rail strike and the 10th strike on 
londons sprawling subway system in 11 weeks the capitals buses 
operated normally 
a dock strike for job guarantees and walkouts for higher pay by 
public service employees at city halls nationwide made things worse 
the wave of industrial strife is the worst in prime minister 
margaret thatchers 10 years in power despite tough new laws by her 
government restricting strikes and outlawing sympathy actions 
employment secretary norman fowler hinted that new antistrike 
legislation could be introduced by the fall 
you dont suddenly start changing the law in that instant way 
but we have been looking at the law in recent weeks he said 
after a breakdown in negotiations tuesday night staterun 
british rail and leaders of the three rail unions resumed talks with 
the help of independent mediators they later adjourned to let union 
leaders hold private discussions 
jimmy knapp general secretary of the national union of 
railwaymen said he was not hopeful of a speedy settlement there 
is a lot of work to be done he said 
with annual inflation running at 83 percent british rail raised 
its offer of a 7 percent increase to 88 percent tuesday night but 
the unions objected to the strings attached 
british rail wants to pay the increase only after all disputes 
have ended and to replace national pay bargaining with regional 
negotiations the unions want to make the extra pay retroactive to 
april 10 and to retain national bargaining 
in the other disputes public services operated by city halls 
were paralyzed on the second day of a 48hour pay strike by nearly 
500000 employees the strike shut libraries and local tax offices 
and hurt care for the handicapped and elderly 
port employers claimed a national dock strike was cracking on its 
second day with nearly 1000 of the countrys 9400 registered dock 
workers defying the transport and general workers union by going to 
work 
however the union stood by its claim that 96 percent of the 
workers were on strike and had shut down major ports like tilbury

contractsanctioned work stoppage wednesday in a move that will keep 
about 60000 coal miners east of the mississippi off the job the 
rest of the week 
police made 17 strikerelated arrests in virginia and nine in a 
pittsburgh suburb and a federal judge refused to order railway 
workers to cross umw picket lines in pennsylvania and west virginia 
the extension was intended to give the pittston co time to 
respond to virginia gov gerald baliles request to resume 
negotiations with striking miners said howard green a umw 
international executive board member 
our goal is to get people back to work and get it settled 
green said 
pittston chairman paul douglas was on jury duty this week and has 
said he wouldnt consider a meeting with umw officials until that 
obligation is over 
about 1900 miners struck pittston in virginia west virginia and 
kentucky april 5 after working without a contract for 14 months

immediately returned and morris feibusch bcoas vice president for 
public affairs refused to comment on the extension 
robert quenon chief executive officer of the giant peabody 
holding co said he hopes to see hopes to see miners back on the 
job at his companys mines soon 
its taken them an awful long time to get things turned 
around he said i hope this twoday extension is about as long 
as it takes and thats about all we have to say on the subject 
but some of the 400 umw members from appalachia and the midwest 
camping out in carterton in southwestern virginia said they had no 
plans to end their wildcat strikes next week 
were going to continue to show our support until some kind of 
settlement is reached said bill wall of west frankfort ill who 
walked away from his job at brushy creek coal mine 
umw district 17 president bob phalen said the memorial period had 
eased tension in the coal fields though state police were reporting 
increasing violence 
theres a lot of things in the coal field that have calmed down 
in three days and an additional two days will help calm things even 
more phalen said 
in virginia state troopers made 17 strikerelated arrests on 
coalhauling roads mostly for impeding traffic said state police 
sgt mike frank 
in alabama police said up to six shots were fired wednesday at a 
coalloading facility where union miners were harassing nonunion 
haulers a shot struck a coal truck but no injuries were reported 
officers said 
in the pittsburgh suburb of neville island pa police charged 
nine demonstrators with obstructing traffic and disorderly conduct 
following a protest in which umw members blocked entrances to a coke 
and iron plant for three hours 
umw members said they targeted shenango inc because it is owned 
by a family whose aloe coal co near imperial pa operates 
nonunion coal mines 
in pittsburgh us district judge donald ziegler refused to 
order 230 monongahela railway co employees to cross umw picket 
lines in pennsylvania and west virginia 
some members of the united transportation union and the

monongahela railway failed to prove its employees are not in 
any immediate danger ziegler said

increased concern about violent crime is 
producing an unlikely congressional coalition behind a plan to add 
100000 officers to police forces across the country by trading 
scholarships for service 
the idea behind the police corps act of 1989 is to boost the 
strength of state and local police forces by up to 22 percent while 
creating a new brand of collegeeducated officers to cope with 
racial tensions gang warfare and other special challenges 
an unusual group of lawmakers has formed around the bill 
including reps barney frank dmass and bob dornan rcalif

house taxwriters under orders to find an

pipe smokers telephone users air travelers and lenders 
those groups would pay more tax under a proposal by rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee but most of the three dozenplus recommendations that he 
presented to the panel tuesday are highly technical changes 
affecting few ordinary taxpayers 
during the budget year that begins oct 1 rostenkowskis plan 
would produce just the amount of new revenue envisioned under a 
deficitreduction agreement between congress and the bush 
administration 
although the plan would require various groups to pay more money 
to the federal government apparently no part of it is a general tax 
increase that would be viewed as conflicting with president bushs

been critical of rafsanjanis socalled pragmatist faction in the 
past indicated that 86 percent of iranians will vote for him in the 
july 28 balloting 
eleven percent said they would vote for his challenger former 
agriculture minister abbas sheibani of the freedom movement irans 
token opposition party 
three percent said they would not vote in the election given 
special significance because it comes so soon after the june 3 death

when tracy chapman played her grammywinning 
song fast cars on this years awards show she did more than 
just herald the return to folkpop she championed the acoustic 
guitar 
after a decade or so of synthetic sounds the acoustic guitar is 
making a comeback the traveling wilburys play acoustics while 
singing songs off their platinum lp and tom pettys new record is 
full of songs written on 6string and 12string acoustics 
chapman played a martin guitar built by cf martin amp co in 
nazareth pa it is a handmade instrument constructed with care 
i wrote and thanked her that night said company chairman 
christian f martin iv whose greatgreatgrandfather founded the 
company in 1833 
at the companys plant 90 craftsmen carefully perform by hand 
the nearly 300 steps necessary to turn indian rosewood amazon 
mahogany and hawaiian koa into an instrument another 100 make the 
strings for the instrument 
the work is timeconsuming the wood is aged up to six months in 
the climatecontrolled work area almost all of the work is done by 
hand with the pearl inlay taking up to two weeks per guitar 
from start to finish it takes three months to build a martin 
guitar 
most are dreadnoughts a widely copied acoustic instrument named 
after a class of world war i british battleships 
ask someone to draw an acoustic guitar and hell draw a 
dreadnought martin said 
the dreadnought which means fear nothing was designed in 
1931 by the company for countrywestern singers who needed a big 
loud guitar it is pearshaped with an extra wide and deep body to 
produce a stronger bass and clearer treble 
the original design is still the most popular and martin said 75 
percent of the 8500 instruments made this year at the plant will be 
dreadnoughts 
this year the company introduced its first acoustic bass priced 
between 2050 and 2350 the original allotment of 50 intruments 
were almost immediately sold out 
we heard tracy chapman bought one the first day it was in the 
stores martin said 
the company now plans on building 350 this year but even that 
wont fill all the orders we cant just crank up production 
martin said 
but most changes do not catch on martin guitar introduced an 
acoustic guitar with a polished black finish it didnt sell because 
musicians wanted the natural wood color 
i thought it would fit with some bands who have outlaw 
images martin said the guitar is thousands of years old 
people wouldnt want us to change it much they want to buy the 
guitar their father bought 
after a peak year in 1971 when martin produced 22627 
instruments the market slowly declined electronic instruments 
became big in the late 1970s and the nation suffered a recession 
severely damaging business for the countrys acoustic guitarmakers 
martins annual sales fell from 18 million to 12 million and 
the company was forced to close factories in connecticut and new 
york as well as sell subsidiaries in sweden and a drum company 
called fibes in nearby easton pa about 330 of 550 employees were 
laid off 
the business started to turn around in 1985 when some musicians 
became tired of the electronic instrument sound also the economy 
had rebounded enough that people could afford a martin which runs 
between 1000 and 5000 
then came susanne vegas folk hit luka in 1987 she received 
three grammy nominations for her song about child abuse then came 
chapmans fast cars a bracing look at innercity poverty that 
won three grammys 
oddly enough the companys founder christian frederick martin 
came to the united states in 1833 because guitars were regarded as a 
fad in germany 
the martins had been members of the cabinet makers guild and 
when christian martin attempted to set up a guitarmaking business 
the violin makers guild attempted to stop him 
they said it was just a fad but they didnt want him to make 
the instruments martin said 
although he successfully went to court and won the right to 
produce guitars he decided to leave germany and come to the united 
states 
he began building guitars in new york city and was an immediate 
success 
thats because the guitar is american martin said when 
people were moving out west what would they play around the 
campfire the guitar a piano was too big for them to bring along 
tired of the big city he moved to nazareth in northeastern 
pennsylvania where the company has survived through good and bad 
times 
even in bad times there will always be a market for a wellmade 
guitar said martin some artists wont use anything else 
also many artists who perform on electric guitars actually 
compose on acoustics the whos pete townshend who uses one on the 
bands current reunion tour mainly writes on acoustic guitars 
still martin knows that todays acoustic success can be fleeting 
its a cyclical business we dont have the clout to change the 
direction of music he said 
but with some trends such as the electronic instruments in the 
1980s the later models make the earlier ones obsolete guitars 
however can last forever 
acoustic instruments get better with time martin said the 
day you buy a guitar is the worst it will sound

thomas s foley knows a political trap when he 
sees one he didnt become speaker of the house by walking into 
them 
so there will be no new pay raise debate in the 
democratcontrolled house unless and until republicans sign on 
enthusiastically and declare the issue off limits politically 
foley wants more than an endorsement of government pay raises 
from president bush he says the administration will have to be 
solidly and actively behind the measure and he says that 
endorsement is going to have to be binding on the republicans 
national political committees as well as the white house 
there has to be absolute bipartisanship foley dwash said 
for good measure the speaker said there will have to be solid 
support in the democratic senate too before the house takes on the 
issue of congressional pay again in the past the senate sometimes 
has had a free political ride on the issue voting against pay 
raises while anticipating house action or inaction that would 
put them into effect 
it didnt work this year the house did vote spurred by public 
protests against a 51 percent pay raise that was due to take effect 
feb 8 and rejected the increase in the process raises for top 
executive branch officials and for federal judges also were scrapped 
so congressional salaries stayed at 89500 a year with senators 
and representatives still entitled to supplement them with the 
widely criticized practice of accepting speechmaking and similar 
fees judicial and executive pay stayed put too since the 
22yearold pay raise system was based on a package deal 
that provides the hook in the terms foley set for action on a 
federal pay raise while the speaker said he personally opposes 
tying judicial and executive raises to an increase in congressional 
pay a house majority would not vote to pry them apart 
bush has proposed pay raises of up to 25 percent for judges and 
top executive branch officials he also recommended that congress 
phase out its honoraria cutting the ceilings by 50 percent on jan 
1 1990 and banning those payments entirely a year later that is 
supposed to be be done in tandem with a congressional pay raise 
bush did not specifically propose one but said he would work with 
congress toward that end 
that doesnt match the administration commitment foley suggested 
at a luncheon with executives and reporters of the associated press 
two weeks before he left office president reagan approved the 51 
percent pay raises recommended by a government salary commission 
after his inauguration bush seconded that but with faint praise he 
said he didnt think he should undo reagans decision 
under the salary commission system dating from 1967 pay 
recommendations took effect with presidential approval unless both 
houses of congress voted to reject them within 30 days this time 
both houses did after former speaker jim wright dtexas scrapped 
plans to let it take effect feb 8 and put pay to a vote 
a bipartisan house panel on compensation and ethics is 
considering the problem now it is likely to recommend an increase 
coupled with sharp restrictions on outside income foley said he 
wants to see its recommendations before deciding on the next step 
foley said any new pay raise proposal will have to be reasonable 
with political support spanning the parties and with no revival of 
the public outcry that was urged on by talk show hosts and others in 
the media last winter he said some people in the news media 
distorted that issue he also acknowledged that the 51 percent 
proposal was too high but said that in recommending it the pay 
commission really was concerned about boosting the compensation of 
federal judges and wasnt thinking about congress 
during that first round most republicans stayed out of the way 
and let wright and his democrats take the heat even though two 
republican presidents had endorsed the raise the republican 
national committee sent out and then withdrew a fundraising 
letter which complained there was a move afoot to let congressmen 
enjoy yet another whopping pay raise 
foley wants a guarantee against that political tactic thats 
unacceptable that sort of goodcop badcop routine he said 
outside of congress congressional pay raises never are popular 
the assurances foley seeks would insure that the branches and the 
parties share the blame after all senators or representative 
republican or democrat the pays the same

a potpourri of reactions has swirled through 
religious circles to recent supreme court decisions on abortion 
executions holiday displays and the flag 
views were about as mixed in the religious household as in 
society at large 
one odd situation found jewish leaders upset because the court 
had approved displaying a jewish symbol regarding the flag 
president bush ignited conflicting religious reactions for wanting 
new laws to shield it 
such a constitutional amendment or legislation is needed said 
the knights of columbus to remove the courts inference that 
burning or otherwise abusing the flag is an acceptable form of 
protest 
the roman catholic fraternal order noted its stress on patriotism 
education in backing measures to save the flag from desecration 
on the other hand the general synod last week of the united 
church of christ said such legislation would exalt the flag 
beyond a treasured symbol of america and restrict the very 
freedom the flag symbolizes 
similarly the american jewish committee said such legislation 
would erode the first amendment which protects the freedom of all 
of us including even crazy people who see fit to burn the 
american flag 
the courts upholding of the death penalty for 16 and 
17yearolds and the moderately retarded was denounced by 
protestant jewish and roman catholic leaders 
it is an outrage that must be changed said the rev thom 
white wolf fassett head of the united methodist board of church and 
society it called the decision reprehensible to people of 
faith 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago terming capital punishment 
itself a poor way to deter crime said he is disappointed and 
saddened by the court decision allowing that penalty for minors 
and the retarded 
the ajc said it is appalled by the decision adding that 
capital punishment degrades and brutalizes society and becomes a 
mockery of justice in executing the young and retarded 
a total of 30 youths all younger than 18 when they committed 
murders now are on death row and the courts have estimated about a 
fifth of nearly 2200 others awaiting execution are retarded to some 
degree 
the abortion decision evoked the most voluminous and diverse 
reactions far more sweeping than the decision itself 
explicitly it held only that missouri could prohibit statebased 
hospitals and personnel from performing abortions other aspects 
remained ambiguous previously congress itself had barred federal 
funds for abortion 
neverthless the impact was thunderous on both sides one 
denouncing the decision as an assault on womens rights and the 
other saying it signaled a turn toward protecting the unborn 
it is the beginning of the opportunity to end this dark night 
of our nations soul in which so terribly many of the most 
defenseless among us our unborn have been denied the right to 
life said the rev richard d land head of the southern baptist 
christian life commission 
the decision is a victory for life and the biggest winners 
are the tiniest people of all children within the womb said 
archbishop john l may of st louis president of the national 
conference of catholic bishops 
however some jewish and protestant leaders decried the decision 
as threatening womens rights 
the ruling is a deplorable attack on the religious freedom of 
all americans said officials of the union of american hebrew 
congregations vowing to oppose any state attempts to limit free 
choice in abortion 
united methodisms socialconcerns executive fassett said the 
court had turned the clock back 20 years on womens right to choose 
abortion and the rulings are highly discriminatory putting the 
heaviest burden on the poor 
however the rev james heidinger executive of the 
denominations evangelical caucus hailed the decision as a 
clearly positive one 
thus within denominations as within the nation feelings were 
divided on an issue which remained about as unsettled as ever 
the courts curiously twoway ruling on religious displays in 
pittsburgh banned a christmas creche cradle scene in a courthouse 
lobby but approved a hanukkah menorah candelabrum on the outside 
remarkably jewish leaders deplored the decision favoring their 
own symbol which the court said was acceptable because it was 
religiously neutral and stood near a secular christmas tree 
the decision will further hasten the transformation of hannukah 
from a religious to a cultural event lamented phil baum 
associate director of the american jewish congress 
this is the inevitable price paid for seeking to enlist 
official endorsement for religious practices 
the ajc saying the court would better have ruled out both the 
creche and menorah added there is simply no religious need for 
the display of sacred symbols of any faith in or at government 
buildings 
on the other hand michael novak roman catholic lay scholar of 
the american enterprise institute said the court is demanding a 
blanket kind of secularism contrary to americas characteristic 
religious nature

rising mutualfund investors would seem to have a lot to applaud 
and little to complain about so far in 1989 
funds in nearly all categories of style and objective have posted 
robust gains since the start of the year helping to push echoes of 
the 1987 crash into distant memory 
an index of growth stock funds calculated by lipper analytical 
services inc reached a record high just a few weeks ago having 
recouped all its 1987 losses and then some 
bond and other income funds meanwhile have rallied sharply of 
late as falling interest rates pushed up the prices of the assets in 
their portfolios 
for the first half of the year according to lipper stock and 
other equity mutual funds averaged a return of 1275 percent 
fixedincome funds returned a lessimposing 692 percent but 
nearly all of that increase came in april may and june after 
interest rates started their descent holding out the promise of 
more good news should rates keep falling in the months ahead 
about the only two blots on the bright overall picture occurred 
in goldoriented funds which have been lagging for some time and 
international funds 
in the eyes of many analysts the weak showing of the gold funds 
betokened an absence of fears about inflation and other economic 
calamities that historically tend to drive up the price of gold 
international funds suffered as the dollar rallied against other 
leading currencies in foreign exchange markets 
the dollar was in demand for a change since it appeared that 
the us economy was heading for a relatively benign soft 
landing while other major industrialized countries struggled with 
increasing inflation and upward pressure on interest rates 
in other words even the poor performance of a few specialized 
sectors of the fund industry reflected seemingly favorable news for 
the overall us investment outlook 
so what could trouble a fund investor these days first of all 
there are those nagging doubts that positive results will be as easy 
to come by in the future as they have been in the recent past 
the equity funds gain the first half stretched out to an annual 
rate works out to about 31 percent noted a michael lipper 
president of lipper analytical thats at least twice the historical 
average 
or to put it another way the funds could achieve no progress at 
all in the second half and still wind up 1989 with results as good 
as they have shown in an average year in the past 
then too theres the question of relative fund performance as 
measured against a standard such as standard amp poors composite 
index of 500 stocks 
the firsthalf gain by the average fund fell short of the 1652 
percent advance posted by the sampp 500 assuming reinvestment of 
dividends 
to veteran fund investors this news is no shock over time in a 
world of hundreds of funds logic suggests that the typical fund 
cannot beat the market 
furthermore the funds results are held back by expenses and 
management fees that are charged against their assets as a 
theoretical unmanaged portfolio the sampp 500 incurs no such 
costs 
if you cant buy the sampp 500 you can buy shares in an index 
mutual fund set up to duplicate its performance as closely as 
possible while minimizing costs 
by its very nature an index fund will never achieve no 1 status 
in the fund performance rankings just as it will never finish at 
the back of the pack 
but over the past 12 months observes norman fosback editor of 
the advisory publication mutual fund forecaster index funds beat 
better than 80 percent of their competitors

when the beatles released their classic sgt 
pepper album in the summer of 1967 joe jackson wasnt paying 
attention he was too busy learning beethoven 
by the albums 20th anniversary however jackson was an 
established rock star preparing material for his next record 
all the talk about sgt pepper got him thinking about his own 
life over the past two decades 
he was born in 1955 in portsmouth england and taught himself 
classical piano later attending the royal academy of music by the 
late 1970s he was one of many young musicians inspired by the punk 
movement and released a pair of hardedged satiric albums look 
sharp and im the man 
when i wrote those look sharp songs jackson recalled i 
was 21 22 and very inspired by early punk i wanted to strip 
everything down to the basics and make some high energy music 
guitar bass and drums i was trying to write decent songs at the 
same time not just trash 
but jackson wanted to record in a variety of styles he released 
an album of 40s blues and swing jumpin jive and used 
shadings of jazz and salsa on body and soul and night and 
day 
its becoming more and more apparant that we have something 
here that doesnt have to be governed by any rules he said we 
can do what we like with that theres a lot of things about rock 
n roll other than youth and rebellion and being 19 and looking 
cool 
jackson ended up writing 12 songs for his new album blaze of 
glory a collection of rockers and ballads that has the orchestral 
feel of sgt pepper and serves musically and lyrically as a 
miniautobiography 
he starts the record with the wideeyed big new world in 
which a young boy imagines an unlimited future 
i sort of grew up reading science fiction comic books the 
34yearold jackson recalled we were watching the moon landing on 
tv and thinking it was all going to come true 
eleven songs and 20 years later jackson is ready to settle for 
simpler pleasures with the human touch dreams of conquering the 
world have given way to a simple wish for intimacy 
you have to adjust jackson said everything is going to 
change as you get older and you have to constantly adjust 
unfortunately we have such a youthobsessed culture that people 
cant see the positive side of that 
in between jackson sings of youth culture rant and rave 
nineteen forever the superpowers evil empire and a 
london that no longer swings down to london 
the music combines rock pop jazz and swing 
you hear a certain lack of consensus now a lack of style of 
the times he said there are no rules theres no such thing as 
rock n roll or pop music anymore there are a zillion different 
kinds of music 
jackson has matured as a singer as well his vocals on blaze of 
glory are relaxed and light in contrast to his earlier records 
where he affects a harsh tone 
i didnt realize you could actually hold back a bit and still 
be ok he said you just sort of got up and screamed your lungs 
out because it was going to be exciting and you were going to show 
everyone you meant it you realize there are other ways of doing 
it 
he sings of rock stars who died young such as buddy holly and 
eddie cochran on the title track and uses lyrics from classic 
songs buffalo springfields for what its worth the whos 
wont get fooled again throughout the record 
i dont think its silly at all to still like those songs 
jackson said the only thing silly to me is people who think its 
the same way trying to depend that 20 years havent gone by 
sgt pepper was the first rock album referred to widely as 
art a dangerous term for music that began as rebellion against 
pretension and snobbery jackson sees it as a positive development 
i think that comes from people having the wrong idea about art 
rather than the wrong idea of rock n roll theres nothing elitist 
or pretentious about art tha arts in the 20th century have been a 
process of democratization cinema jazz and rock n roll 
you can call it what you like but theres no doubt in my mind 
that what im doing is art and im an artist of course im an 
artist what am i going to say im a plumber

cost issues in insurance seem to erupt on a 
regular basis accompanied by rising rates angry responses from 
state insurance commissioners and threats by companies to drop out 
of the business 
while the issues seem to develop as suddenly as a summer 
thunderstorm usually they have simmered for many months within the 
industry or between the industry and insurance commissioners 
the beginning of one such issue could be right now workers 
compensation insurance seems to be getting out of control claims 
are soaring and a study of the industry suggests profits have just 
about disappeared 
the system is being overused says robert a brian whose 
study is now being circulated among property and casualty insurers 
we either control the benefits he says or i see no reason 
for insurers to continue writing 
brian isnt an insurer but he knows the industry thoroughly 
since he is senior vice president of conning amp co a hartfordbased 
securities firm that specializes in insurance companies he is 
responsible for all its research 
in 1989 he estimates the entire industry will write 284 
billion of premiums and pay out 268 billion leaving a balance of 
16 billion that is payouts will amount to about 94 percent of 
the money taken in 
to the uninitiated that might not seem too bad but if you look 
back in brians statistical sheets youll see that in 1982 the 
percentage was only 735 but that he points out is only the 
beginning of the story 
when deductions are made for administrative expenses inflation 
and dividends paid to policyholders says brian the industry will 
end the year having paid out 120 for every dollar collected 
thats not good business 
yes but the companies will have had the use of billions of 
dollars during the year and that should provide them with 
investment income true said brian it will bring them back to the 
breakeven point that is zero return 
he suggests that with no return on capital companies arent 
likely to persist very long in writing this essential form of 
insurance which reimburses employees for lost income and medical 
costs 
as he sees it the benefits system has to be controlled viewing 
a graph of benefits paid since 1975 gives the impression of a spiral 
winding up for a bust claims totaled 52 billion in 1975 in 1988 
an estimated 239 billion 
the issue of who will pay employers or insurers is important 
but it probably isnt the bigger problem potentially larger is how 
to save a system whose users seem to be imposing a steadily higher 
burden on it 
many factors are involved theoretically says brian you could 
point to several economic factors such as the size of the work 
force wage inflation and medical inflation 
you might also point the finger at legislated benefits increases 
including the broadening view of what constitutes a compensable 
claim 
he discounts the possibility of these being the main factors in 
fact he calls attention to a decline over recent years in the 
pressure exerted by state legislatures the main reason he says is 
system overuse 
to offer that explanation is perhaps to invite inquiry into 
sociological factors but somehwere in that area are some answers 
whatever the reason relief is needed or a crisis could develop 
insurers have a reputation sometimes applied scornfully of 
watching every penny some might seek to cut their own expenses but 
failing in that area they seem likely to raise rates and thats 
when the storm breaks

the san luis valley a desert averaging 7 
inches of rain a year may be sitting on one of the continents 
largest aquifers 
far from easing competition over water though the prospect of a 
vast underground water supply has triggered a battle over how the 
precious resource should be developed and by whom 
the san luis valley aquifer probably has more water in it than 
the ogallala aquifer which provides water for several major 
agricultural states said maurice strong founder and chairman of 
american water development inc 
its the first time ive seen the people of this valley get 
together and fight something said retired water division engineer 
hd mcfadden thats because its an outsider coming in here to 
take our water 
the outsider in question is denverbased american water which 
wants to drill 97 wells on its 155000acre baca grant ranch and 
pump as much as 200000 acrefeet a year from the aquifer or 
slightly more than 65 billion gallons an acrefoot is enough water 
to cover one acre a foot deep 
in a december 1986 application the company said it wanted the 
water for ranch uses and agricultural projects when pressed by 
nervous residents it admitted it eventually would sell the water to 
thirsty cities like denver 
company officials say the development will benefit the valley 
however creating jobs and encouraging new industries the company 
maintains in its application that the aquifer is so big it can 
support current claims plus new projects 
its a very major resource for the valley and for us said 
strong who insisted he was speaking as an interested individual 
not company chairman 
the venture is opposed by virtually everyone with a stake in the 
valleys current waterrights system the case could be heard as 
early as this fall in division three water court a specialized 
state court in alamosa 
the san luis valley where a mere 41000 people are scattered 
across 8200 square miles gets its water from the rio grande and 
its tributaries and from underground water that runs off the san 
juan and sangre de cristo mountains 
the complex system of water rights revolves around the closed 
basin project a federal project begun in the 1970s to help colorado 
meet obligations to new mexico and texas under the rio grande 
compact of 1939 
the project is a network of shallow wells and pipelines that 
lower the water table to prevent evaporation and pump about 100000 
acrefeet a year into lakes and wildlife refuges and into the rio 
grande it covers 2900 square miles of alamosa and saguache 
counties including a corner of the baca ranch where streams dont 
run into the rio grande 
the rio grande water conservation district which sponsors the 
closed basin and represents water users in five of the six valley 
counties has led a costly court opposition it had to more than 
double its millage levy in december 1987 
other opponents include the state division of wildlife and water 
conservation board and the federal bureaus of land management and 
reclamation and the fish and wildlife and national parks services 
they are concerned about the effects of american waters plan on the 
closed basin project and some marshes in the valley that are home to 
endangered waterfowl 
the company cites a us geological survey finding that the 
aquifer holds 2 billion acrefeet of water about the same as the 
ogallala aquifer it also argues that the water under baca ranch is 
nontributary meaning its levels would not affect water levels in 
the rest of the valley 
rio grande district manager ralph curtis said the plan could 
deplete as much as 38 percent of the closed basin projects water 
and a recent study by the san luis valley water conservation 
district says much of the aquifer water may not be recoverable it 
could be alkaline or otherwise contaminated 
mcfadden said the valleys hydrology still is little known but 
evidence suggests all the water beneath it is connected taking 
200000 acrefeet at the baca could lower the water table below many 
existing wells he said 
opponents also reject a claim by american water that the state 
has no jurisdiction over the water because baca ranch was a spanish 
land grant subject to spanish law 
the company offered in november to drop its application if 
opponents would withdraw as well and agree to cooperate on more 
aquifer studies 
david robbins the districts attorney said his clients are 
willing to discuss but not dismiss for one thing they want court 
costs 
there was a lot of hucksterism said robbins mr strong 
and his cohorts in 1986 without word one to anyone in the valley 
sprung their claim 
they forced people in the valley to spend enormous amounts of 
money finding out about those claims they have been unforthcoming 
about what it is theyre going to do and how theyre going to do 
it 
strong became a player in valley issues 11 years ago when he took 
control of phoenixbased azl resources inc which among other 
investments owned the baca grant ranch near crestone in a 
northeastern corner of the valley 
before that he had built an international reputatio0712 ra amdukakisfiscal

as the dust clears an uprising in the episcopal 
church over women priests and lately a woman bishop appears to be 
settling into a working though edgy adjustment 
keen differences still exist between church policy affirming 
womens ordination and opponents of it but earlier indications of 
breakup have given way to stopgap accommodation 
the modus vivendi has emerged on both sides in the wake of a 
june gathering of nearly 2000 episcopalian traditionalists who 
were summoned to organize resistance to women in the clergy 
the protesters decided after initial harsh talk of rupture that 
they would try to stick with the denomination through some special 
arrangements the churchs leadership seemed responsive 
i believe that there are ways we can not only stay together but 
enrich one another says the most rev edmond l browning 
presiding bishop of the 25 millionmember denomination 
asked about the implications of the large meeting of 
traditionalists in fort worth texas he said he has a great deal 
of hope 
similarly optimistic reactions came from the dissident camp 
we can live together said retired fort worth bishop a 
donald davies who was elected executive director of the new 
episcopal synod of america which was organized by the meeting to 
stay in the denomination yet help traditionalist parishes 
we could have separated if wed have pursued that course but 
im glad we didnt davies said in a telephone interview we 
want to be the church in the church and work with fellow bishops to 
provide a comprehensive ministry 
browning who has strongly supported women in the priesthood 
said there is not only a place in the church for those opposing 
that position but what they bear witness to is needed for the 
health of the whole body 
without them we would be a weaker church he said 
he said the threat to the church comes not from people who call 
themselves traditionalists but from superheated rhetoric that 
polarizes people 
i am working as are others to keep the climate one where 
people can hear each other and not become polarized we are working 
for openness and a spirit of respect and courtesy browning said 
the fort worth meeting was triggered by the massachusetts 
dioceses election to the episcopate last fall of a woman now 
suffragan bishop barbara harris the session started out in a 
bitter defiant mood but gradually mellowed 
originally some wanted to leave the denomination davies 
said but bishops of the evangelical and catholic mission the 
sponsoring group of traditionalists were determined if possible 
to stay within the church 
im very pleased we didnt get into angry reaction he said 
adding that in the end a sense of unity and harmony prevailed 
recognizing that maintaining it necessitates room for diversity 
the meeting adopted a plan for episcopal visitors bishops 
of traditionalist views from outside a diocese to handle episcopal 
duties such as confirmations in traditionalist congregations that 
ask for it 
such arrangements requiring permission of the diocesan bishop 
involved were approved by the churchs 1988 convention the 
requests have to be channeled through browning the presiding bishop 
an international commission of the worldwide anglican communion 
which comprises the episcopal church and 26 other national branches 
totaling about 70 million members sanctioned such special 
arrangements 
six of the 27 branches have authorized women priests although 
not the mother church of england thus producing varying 
practices worldwide 
asked what would occur if a diocesan bishop declined to approve 
an episcopal visitor in an area where a traditionalist 
congregation wanted one davies said we hope that doesnt 
happen 
however he added if we ask for permission to come in and get 
a negative response and if after asking the presiding bishop to 
intervene the answer still is no we might feel compelled to go 
in anyhow 
that would violate canonical provisons regarding episcopal acts 
in neighboring dioceses and presumably could lead to formal rifts 
or schism 
if there is no cooperation whatsoever we probably would go in 
without it davies said if we didnt the traditionalist 
congregation would be cut off 
however he said he felt the system was a basis for reconciling 
differences he said that browning in conversations has given 
his assurance of a place for traditionalists 
he will make sure of it davies said it fits his pattern 
of leadership he has taken the issue seriously and the people that 
raised it seriously 
traditionalists also have opposed the churchs revised prayerbook 
of 1979 but davies said its now pretty well accepted mainly 
because an extended option allowed for using it or the old 1928 
version 
asked if it were possible traditionalists eventually would accept 
women priests in a church that now has 1200 women among 14000 
clergy davies said 
its always a possiblity but its a different kind of issue 
it would break with a 2000year tradition of an undivided church

the action was in response to 135 letters requesting it 
it provides for specific afternoon masses in july and august at

asked for services in the tridentine mass as used before english in

the rev bradford helman diocesan vicar for worship emphasized 
that regular parish masses would remain in english he said a

misrepresented that the tridentine mass is the will of the pope 
deploring such confusion helman said the tridentine mass by 
the typical massgoer is neither the will of the holy father nor the

the name fits 
out of nowhere the new kids on the block have hit the streets to 
claim the no 1 spot on the billboard singles chart with their 
ballad ill be loving you forever 
theyre the hottest teen group to come along since the jacksons 
the osmonds the jets menudo and new edition 
the new kids on the block include brothers jordan and jonathan 
knight danny wood joe mcintyre and donnie wahlberg they range in 
age from 16 to 19 
the success is mindboggling to the selfdescribed street 
kids from boston 
i think its great said jonathan 19 with a typical 
teenage giddiness the odds of this actually happening are 
astronomical were so lucky 
but the new kids groan at the mention of the osmond comparison or 
any other association with teen bubblegum music in fact their 
music is a little bit of everything 
i just think the bubblegum label for any group is an 
insult its like teens dont have the right to make music thats 
good and appealing to other teens said donnie 19 
donnie admits however the quintets first album new kids on 
the block might have seemed youthful as we grow up our music 
will grow up too he said 
their second album hangin tough has sold more than 1 
million copies and spawned two other top 10 singles please dont 
go girl and youve got it the right stuff 
they recently taped a segment of kids choice an award show 
for the cable tv channel nickelodeon at universal studios the 
group performed its next single hangin tough 
like the jets and osmonds the new kids are as squeaky clean as 
their image they are welldressed and wellmannered they attend 
classes during the school year and they brag about having never 
done drugs a rarity in a business full of raucous rock bands and 
recovering substance abusers 
i think our success gives other kids role models positive role 
models because we dont do drugs or things like that i think 
thats important said jordan 18 
in honor of their antidrug stance massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis proclaimed april 24 1989 new kids on the block day 
the sudden rise to fame hasnt jaded them they were still 
excited about being taped for a television show and likewise 
starstruck at all the celebrities theyre getting to meet on their 
way up 
i just met alyssa milano said joe 16 referring to the 
teenage costar of abcs whos the boss 
its not like a job right now were just having a whole lot of 
fun he said 
the fun includes gathering mostly teenage fans all over the 
country the group estimates their average fan is female and ranges 
in age from 12 to 16 
the new kids were discovered in boston by producer maurice starr 
who staged a citywide search in 1984 to create a band such as new 
edition which he also put together 
at first the quintet focused on rap and rhythm and blues but 
werent satisfied with the minor success the first album achieved 
so they widened their musical style and honed their dance steps 
for now the boys are concentrating on developing their vocal 
prowess and sing much like a polished street corner group but in 
the future they plan to start working more with their own 
instruments and incorporating them on albums and in performances 
they have toured the united states off and on since last summer 
opening in some cities for tiffany another teen singer 
the groups next project is an album called merry merry 
christmas due for release in the fall the record contains 
traditional holiday fare such as white christmas and more 
modern originals such as a funky funky christmas 
as for the kids theyre loving every busy minute but cant say 
the same for their parents 
its like the grass is always greener on the other side our 
parents wanted us to make it really bad but now they kinda miss 
us said donnie

two of this summers hottest sequels 
ghostbusters ii and lethal weapon 2 have received boosts 
from supporting players who never really wanted the parts 
surrounded by bill murray dan aykroyd and sigourney weaver 
peter macnicol steals the movie as the villainous wordmangling art 
restorer janosz poha in ghostbusters ii 
joe pesci as the troublesome but lovable leo getz fits right in 
with mel gibson and danny glover the highpowered stars of lethal 
weapon 2 
but neither macnicol or pesci initially wanted the part 
why would mcnicol an accomplished theater performer and featured 
player in the acclaimed film sophies choice want to switch 
from shakespeare to slime after reading the script he called his 
agent and told him to forget it 
pesci enjoyed the comic police thriller lethal weapon but 
never imagined adding himself to the surefire team of gibson and 
glover when his agent advised him a funny part was available in the 
sequel pesci was skeptical after all he was better known for 
playing tough guys in raging bull and once upon a time in 
america 
but both actors reconsidered 
what impressed macnicol about ghostbusters ii was the name 
vigo of carpathia the evil spirit that haunts the film his 
mind quickly filled in details 
i thought what can i do with this carpathia connection why 
does this art restorer know so much about this particular painting 
maybe theres some kinship of country involved there this is all 
in a matter of seconds i called back the agent and said id go 
in macnicol said 
pesci tired of scripts that were blatant imitations of joey 
lamotta the boxer jakes brother in raging bull took a liking 
to getz and agreed to talk to producers richard donner and joel 
silver getz in protective custody is an accountant who has 
laundered nearly half a billion dollars in drug money from the 
organization that gibson and glover are trying to crack 
i explained that i saw him very frantic and a big pest and a 
whiner wanting to be a cop and a hero himself knowing all about 
police procedures i acted out a couple of bits for the character 
and they both started laughing they said what are we wasting time 
for lets get him in wardrobe its funny let him do it 
receiving the part was the first step for pesci he still wasnt 
sure if he would hurt or help the team of gibson and glover 
i knew when i met mel and danny and hung with them a little bit 
if i could pull this off pesci said mel and danny had their 
own way of working its hard to break into something like that 
they dont know where youre coming from theyre afraid to 
just say go ahead and ruin our movie cmon in and ruin it they 
were going to be nice and also a little cautious that was opening 
day but it worked out well 
like murray and aykroyd macnicol had an extensive background in 
improvisational theater the dallas native added his own touches to 
his screen character speaking broken english in a thick eastern 
european accent 
when i did read for the part i said anything goes because 
i had seen the guys out in the waiting room they were young john 
carradine types tall quiet and menacing this thing this 
character came full blown like athena out of my skull judging from 
the looks in their eyes they were thinking we can use this guy 
we got to use this guy 
pesci also took liberties drawing on an unusual source for 
getzs flustered way of expressing himself 
if you go to disneyland in california all the employees are 
mormons from utah nice kids great smiles pesci explained 
they handle people all day long they never get angry 
you walk up to one and say excuse me were looking all over 
the place and cant find fantasyland they start saying ok ok 
fantasyland ok ok youre here ok ok i just added to it 
macnicol and pesci each play characters far different from 
themselves they wanted it that way 
thats the fun for me macnicol explained its like a 
hunt looking for all the characteristics making up this mosiac i 
think im one of the youngest character actors 
yeah thats the best pesci said ive heard a million 
actors say it its such a great thing to get out of yourself 
somewhere else 
we all have a little bit of leo getz or joey lamotta we all 
have these kinds of people in us thats where an actor gets it 
from what you do is bring that part of you out more as if you were 
that type of a person 
but the actors took differing views of a supporting players 
responsibilities 
they dont have to do any of the awful chores macnicol said 
they dont have to heave that story along they get to have the 
most fun 
it is fun but its still a job pesci cautioned the other 
way to look at it is if the character fails if the movie fails i 
could have gotten the heat for it well they brought this other 
character in there and he was jerking around trying to be funny and 
he wasnt funny

it may not be as well known as the sat but the 
gesell test taken by kindergartners in nearly onefifth the nations 
school districts can be just as important to a childs future 
backers argue it can spare the immature a lot of grief in early 
schooling but the gesell institute which publishes the test is in 
deep financial trouble as a growing chorus of critics say it can 
wrongly and indelibly brand the very young as slow

diane jackson calls it the gift of 
time for beth bradley it was the theft of a year 
jacksons daughter jennifer and bradleys son shane are among 
thousands of 2 to 6yearolds each year who take the gesell 
school readiness test designed to assess physical social and 
emotional maturity 
the gesell is in effect a kiddie board as crucial to school 
success as the college board exams taken years later 
the outcome can determine whether a child attends regular 
kindergarten or first grade or is consigned to an extra year in 
slowerpaced transitional or developmental kindergartens for 
the less mature 
the gesell institute located here in two tudor mansions next 
door to yale universitys divinity school estimates its test is 
used in 18 percent of us school districts but educators and 
psychologists have lately criticized it as biased scientifically 
baseless and prone to abuse 
a loose cannon says education professor samuel meisels of 
the university of michigan speaking of the test its being used 
to hurt kids in the name of beneficence 
such criticisms have taken a heavy financial toll on the 
78yearold institute acting director laura freebainsmith told a 
reporter earlier this month following a second consecutive year of 
deficits the institute decided to put its new haven properties up 
for sale and reduce its teacher training staff from 10 to 2 
gesell leaders meanwhile acknowledge the abuses and say the 
test is being updated 
nonetheless they stand by its basic soundness and point to 
legions of teachers and principals who praise it as a valuable tool 
to help them assign children to appropriate classes 
fads come and go but the gesell work is correct said 
freebairnsmith 
jennifer and shane got the same verdict from gesell they tested 
immature and school authorities advised an extra year 
jennifers mother now says the extra year worked miracles she 
just finished firstgrade with a baverage at golfield elementary 
school in rockledge fla 
but shanes mother says the test made her son a wreck he was so 
unhappy in what he called the dummy class in denver city texas 
that she took him out two weeks early last spring 
the gesell test is not new its author dr arnold gesell a 
pediatrician and school psychologist first published it in 1925 
mainly as a tool for doctors rather than educators 
now school districts across the country use it its especially 
popular in florida connecticut north carolina new hampshire 
michigan louisiana texas oklahoma and california according to 
susan l sweitzer who runs the workshops where teachers train to 
administer the test 
but never have its merits been so hotly challenged by educators 
psychologists and parents 
i think every test maker bears the burden of proof that their 
test does what they say it will do they have not demonstrated that 
they resort to faith said meisels 
theres a lot of truth in the criticisms said 
freebairnsmith its forced us to take a look at how our test is 
used 
the gesell is unlike the usual standardized pencilandpaper test 
for about 20 minutes a teacher or counselor has a youngster 
build with blocks name animals answer questions such as what did 
you get for your last birthday and fill in a drawing of an 
incomplete man missing limbs and facial features 
to the trained eye the answers are supposed to reveal maturity 
for example a 5 or 6year old might write a beautifully formed 
letter o but if a child starts the letter at the bottom of the 
circle thats taken as a sign of immaturity 
likewise children who draw belly buttons on the incomplete 
man who wears an incomplete bow tie are often judged less 
mature 
a review of the test in the mental measurements yearbook an 
annual guide to standardized tests says gesell has offered no 
evidence of internal consistency reliability stability over time 
or empirical validity 
critics also charge the questions are outdated and biased against 
minorities and poor children the tests norms or averages were 
last updated in 1979 and they were based on 640 new england 
children only 7 percent of whom were minorities 
the test asks for example what does your daddy do the 
question might baffle the many children nowadays who lack livein 
daddies 
gesells critics who include several early childhood education 
associations recently called for an end to mass standardized 
testing of young children 
some of gesells woes reflect recent criticisms aimed at 
standardized tests generally the scholastic aptitude test taken by 
collegebound high school students has been similarly accused of 
bias unfairness and misuse 
the gesell debate is also related to a larger dispute among 
educators are many schoolchildren too old for their grade or too 
young 
louise bates ames at 80 a bestselling author of childrearing 
guides and the institutes guiding spirit since dr gesells death 
in 1961 contends that as many as half of us schoolchildren are 
overplaced or too young for their grade many eventually get 
labeled slow or learning disabled 
such problems might never occur said ames if children were 
promoted on the basis of developmental age not chronological 
age if educators and parents would only heed the tests results 
fewer children would drop out or be held back later she said 
what were looking at is the whole spectrum of 12 to 13 years 
of schooling its not so much a fear that a kid wont make it in 
kindergarten its hard for parents to see that said jane keirns 
a member of gesells national lecture staff 
test critics take the opposite view they see little virtue in a 
test that helps schools justify keeping youngsters from progressing 
with their peers and they oppose segregating children who test 
young on the gesell into developmental kindergartens or 
transitional classes 
theres little that supports what goes on in developmental k 
if a kid is at least one year too old by ninth grade the 
probability of dropping out is 50 percent greater said meisels 
at least 20 percent of kids in kindergarten are too old for their 
grade it may be substantially greater than that 
the tests validity is hard to evaluate there are no objectively 
right or wrong answers

like any car that has been around for a decade the mazda rx7 
has changed the car is wider and more expensive the outside 
styling is more rounded and the rx7 has been transformed from a 
spirited scooter to a more substantial sports car 
but thankfully some of the best features remain the durable 
smooth rotary engine the sporty handling and nimble responsiveness 
and the reardrive design 
the performance of the mazda rx7 gtus test car clearly showed 
that many of the selective changes over the years have helped keep 
the rx7 a viable competitor in the sports car field 
the engine in the test car teamed with fivespeed manual 
transmission started easily and worked smoothly in both city and 
highway driving the gtus is not the fastest sports car around with 
a rating of 77 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph but it had plenty of 
good steady zip and theres a higherpriced turbocharged rx7 
model that offers even quicker acceleration 
i also appreciated the fact that the reardrive design meant 
there was no torque steer under hard acceleration as there is in so 
many frontdrive sporty cars though i noticed that the test car 
gulped down the fuel i was impressed by the highrevving rotary 
engine especially knowing it has earned a reputation for 
reliability 
a mazda spokesman noted that rx7s have done extraordinarily 
well in endurancerelated racing consumer reports also ranks 
highly the rx7s of the 198287 model years they consistently 
earned a much better than average label in the magazines survey of 
car owners 
the mazda spokesman mentioned the loyalty among many rx7 owners 
with about 41000 members the rx7 clubs around the country are 
rank as one of the largest collection of clubs honoring a single car 
marque 
fit and finish on the test car was superb the ventilation system 
was powerful and the seats redesigned for 1989 with more lateral 
support were firm and sturdy which i appreciated as i got 
accustomed to the cars hard sporty ride 
there was only room for two in the gtus test car though mazda 
offers a twoplustwo gxl model 
behind the two front seats in the test car were two deeply 
recessed storage boxes with locks followed by a flat hatchback area 
with luggage straps to keep items from sliding around the hatchback 
lid popped all the way up with a touch of a lever that was to the 
lower left of the driver seat 
however i found it a bit awkward to bend over the back of the 
car body and reach way inside the hatchback area yet because of the 
hatchbacks sloping lid the taller items i carried always had to be 
placed up front behind the seats which also was the hardest spot 
to get at 
the rx7 gtus comes with automatic shoulder belts that were the 
most sensitive and comforting ive seen if i suddenly tried to 
reach for the glove box or even move forward to look to the right 
that driver belt would hold me in 
the dashboard layout was clear easy to read with no digital 
gadgets the blinker was a little lever on the dashboard like that 
in the ford probe and the lights that warn that the brake is on 
the hatch is open or that something is wrong under the hood were 
uniquely grouped next to the clock in the middle of the dash 
the rx7 at 6995 for its april 1978 debut in the united 
states was a midpriced sports car in its early days and still 
holds that position though its price range today is from 17300 to 
25600 
a mazda spokesman said competitors include toyota mr2 which 
starts around 14000 and the chevrolet corvette which starts 
around 31000 
partly because of the higher prices for sports cars partly 
because of increased competition from sporty coupes that offer 
seating for more than two passengers and partly because of rising 
insurance costs sales of the rx7 have been declining they hit 
56205 in 1986 then fell to 38345 in 1987 and 27814 in 1988 
mazda said sales of about 20000 are expected this year 
because of the increase in insurance costs some buyers are being 
quoted prices for insurance on their sports cars that are higher 
than their monthly car payments a mazda spokesman said 
a typical rx7 buyer has median age of 36 according to rod 
bymaster product manager of sports and sporty cars for mazda motor 
of america sixtyfive percent of rx7 buyers are male and half are 
married he said sixtyseven percent have a college degree or more 
and the median household income is between 55000 and 60000 
though mazda now is promoting its newest twoseat car the 
miata which starts at 13800 the company said the rx7 will 
remain the miata is coming into the lower end of the sports car 
market because the rx7 has moved upscale a spokesman explained

the sandinista national liberation front won a 
bitter civil war in nicaragua 10 years ago that ended the 
42yearold somoza dynasty but the promise of the revolution is yet 
to be realized here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a decade has passed since july 19 
1979 when exuberant sandinista leaders rode into the city behind 
young guerrillas in makeshift uniforms who had driven out the 
entrenched somoza dictatorship 
how does nicaragua fare after a decade of revolution 
the sandinistas remain firmly in power despite determined us 
opposition but the people do not have a better life the economy is 
destitute some colleagues have joined the opposition and the soviet 
union has become less generous with aid 
there is sandinismo here for another 50 years an experienced 
south american diplomat said but a recent report said last years 
per capita gross national product was 300 
that would make nicaragua the western hemispheres poorest 
country a distinction long held by haiti and puts it in the same 
economic category as somalia sudan and other poor african nations 
with general elections only seven months away the organizational 
skills and popularity of the sandinista national liberation front 
face a tough test 
sandinismo has preserved its populist essence and the grassroots 
organization of a group that knows how angry citizens who feel they 
have nothing to lose can overthrow a government it is getting a 
negative message from some of those citizens 
i dont need to know about numbers said a managua woman who 
works as a domestic all i know is that every month things are 
getting worse weve been like this for 10 years these people dont 
know what theyre doing its time we had a change 
the gross national product figure was in a study commissioned by 
the sandinistas and underwritten by sweden that also said 
consumption had fallen by more than 70 percent since 1979 and the 
buying power of workers was down by more than 92 percent 
part of the study was presented in may to a conference of 16 
potential aid donors in stockholm president daniel ortega said 
nicaragua needed 250 million in aid for 1989 alone but left 
stockholm with only 50 million 
ortega denied nicaragua was among the worlds poorest nations he 
said studies by a us economist his government hired found all of 
latin america is undergoing a serious economic recession in which 
the standard of living has dropped to levels of 11 years ago 
the study sponsored by sweden recommends that some sandinista 
policies be reversed by halting land redistribution emphasizing 
private production and slashing the military education and health 
budgets 
there will be no reversal ortega said the revolutionary 
project continues 
he has traveled the country issuing land titles to tenant 
farmers his government confiscated the plantations of three growers 
who opposed the sandinistas and threatened to seize the land of 
other economic saboteurs 
lately progovernment news media have been recalling the civil 
war that brought victory in july 1979 
one photograph shows ortega and other guerrilla commanders guns 
slung on their shoulders riding into managua in a crowded jeep 48 
hours after president anastasio somoza had fled the country 
some guerrilla leaders and antisomoza politicians who celebrated 
on that day later left to fight again against the sandinistas 
among them was eden pastora the fabled commander zero who became 
the deputy defense minister but defected in 1981 to the 
ussupported contra guerrillas 
alfredo cesar president of the central bank left nicaragua on 
his honeymoon in 1982 and joined the directorate of the nicaraguan 
resistance the umbrella for antisandinista organizations in exile 
cesar returned a month ago as a member of the political opposition 
the most striking loss was of violeta barrios de chamorro widow 
of murdered publisher pedro joaquin chamorro who had been a foe of 
somoza chamorros assassination caused a groundswell of support for 
the sandinistas 
mrs chamorros family owns the newspaper la prensa now in 
opposition to the sandinistas she became a member of the first 
junta but resigned in april 1980 declaring the sandinista goals to 
be incompatible with her hopes for a democratic nicaragua 
current sandinista thinking seems to be that only a continuation 
of their populist policies will win the election yet some of those 
policies are alienating the private sector and pushing the economy 
deeper into crisis 
in past years sandinista leaders have said the very survival of 
their revolution was its greatest triumph 
a ussupported guerrilla war began two years after the 
revolution the sandinistas have survived the cutoff of 
international credits instigated by washington and the destruction 
wrought last october by hurricane joan which they estimated at 800 
million 
they have done so thanks in large part to aid from the soviet 
bloc and friends in northern europe notably sweden but that aid 
has diminished 
with declining aid and election impending the sandinistas have 
fallen back on one of their strengths organizing from the bottom up 
neighborhood groups known as sandinista defense committees had 
vanished because of resistance by the population but are being 
revived organizations of women youth and peasants are being 
strengthened

the writer a former central america 
correspondent now based in atlanta was in managua when the 
victorious sandinista guerrilla army entered the nicaraguan capital 
this is his account of that tumultuous day 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ten years ago just before noon on a blisteringhot thursday the 
first jubilant ragtag column of sandinistas entered managua 
following their only tank down a side street to the bunker of ousted 
dictator anastasio somoza 
without firing a shot the guerrillas burst through the gate of 
the deserted military headquarters and swarmed into the bunker and 
supply sheds ending a bitter bloody revolution that brought the 
biggest change in central america since independence from spain 
somoza had fled to miami two days earlier leaving the country 
his family had ruled for 42 years in the hands of a caretaker 
president who also fled after only a few hours in office 
managua looked nearly empty the morning of july 19 1979 a day 
nicaraguans call simply the victory somozas soldiers aware 
that the sandinistas were only hours away had been deserting their 
positions all night abandoning weapons and vehicles donning 
civilian clothes blending into the population 
after dawn church bells on the outskirts began to ring the 
bells had signaled rebel victories in other towns and cities 
a group of government soldiers slipped into the lobby of the 
intercontinental hotel next to the military headquarters and 
peeled off the uniforms they wore over civilian clothes they left 
the uniforms weapons and other gear on the lobby floor 
most people stayed in their homes as that first column of about 
700 sandinista fighters from the northern city of leon walked by 
later in the day thousands more from rebelheld southern cities 
poured into the capital in commandeered government trucks 
inside somozas compound guerrillas threw down their old 
weapons shed tattered uniforms and outfitted themselves with new 
clothing 
a sandinista couple posed for pictures in somozas bed with a 
redandblack rebel flag draped over the headboard somoza had lived 
in the bunker for several weeks 
a tired guerrilla with holes in his boots found several cases of 
usmade crations and retired to somozas office put his feet on 
the desk under a portrait of the departed enemy and enjoyed a can of 
peaches he said it was his first food in two days 
managua became a madhouse that day the victors fired thousands 
of newly captured bullets into the air commandeered cars and 
painted them with sandinista slogans they freed hundreds of 
political and ordinary prisoners from jails in managua and nearby 
tipitapa 
wild shooting continued for two hours but miraculously no one 
was hit then a tropical downpour drenched and calmed the city 
daniel ortega the member of the fivemember sandinista junta who 
would become president arrived from costa rica at about 530 pm 
on friday july 20 when all had reached managua the junta 
members were given a tumultuous welcome in the main plaza by about 
500000 people a sandinista flag dangled from a statue atop the 
wrecked shell of managuas cathedral 
the civil war was over one nicaraguan in five was homeless and 
by red cross estimates about 45000 people had been killed 
reporters who entered somozas bunker before the guerrillas 
arrived found unfinished cups of coffee beside maps in the war room 
the generals hat worn by somoza a west point graduate was on its 
accustomed hook 
two partially packed suitcases had been left behind their 
contents halfscattered in the room 
somozas departure by private jet had long been a question of 
when not if 
the united states his main military supplier had stopped 
shipments and pressured others to do so by some accounts somoza 
could have defended his position for only about three weeks and 
lacked the arms to recapture any of the more than 25 cities held by 
the sandinistas 
with army casualties mounting and guerrilla forces growing he 
faced a manpower problem 
toward the end barefoot young men from the atlantic jungle 
region were being trucked into government training camps and sent 
out less than a week later to face seasoned disciplined guerrilla 
fighters in an uneven battle 
us ambassador lawrence pezzullo had been meeting almost daily 
with somoza arguing the hopelessness of the dictators situation 
somoza rarely left his bunker reporters kept an eye on it during 
the day but were prevented from doing so at night by a 7 pm 
shoottokill curfew 
on monday july 16 somozas prized parrots were brought in their 
cages to the bunker that night he met secretly with his national 
assembly and resigned 
an aide confirmed that somoza left for miami where he had an 
estate at 4 am on tuesday july 17 the aide fled a day later 
pezzullo moved to panama on wednesday with other key members of 
the us embassy staff 
now it was thursday morning july 19 and the church bells rang 
in the distance managua was without police or a government 
thousands of citizens were armed with rifles dropped by somozas 
soldiers no one was in charge 
many people who had not fired a shot in the war suddenly became 
sandinistas setting up freelance roadblocks and checkpoints armed 
with found weapons 
within a few years three of the five original junta members two 
nicaraguan ambassadors to washington and a top sandinista field 
commander had abandoned the new government some had joined the 
armed opposition 
the united states was financing and training the growing contra 
rebel movement and nicaragua was at war with itself again

anglofrench takeover strategist sir james 
goldsmith is being characteristically flamboyant with his joint 21 
billion offer for bat industries plc 
the hostile offer for the diversified british conglomerate 
which may be best known in the united states by its kool and benson 
and hedges cigarettes and saks fifth avenue and marshall fields 
department stores is only the latest bold move by goldsmith a 
jetsetter who already has established a reputation as an 
international takeover strategist 
the 56yearold goldsmith was joined in the bat industries bid by 
british investor jacob rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry 
packer 
earlier this year goldsmith formed a takeover vehicle called 
anglo group plc which he said would be an industrial improvement 
organization its bids for undervalued firms he said could well 
be thoroughly hostile 
so far the investment group has bought a 299 percent stake in 
the british food company ranks hovis mcdougall plc 
but long before anglo group goldsmith had created a reputation 
as a takeover strategist both in europe and in the united states 
where his conquests included crown zellerbach corp diamond 
international and continental group goldsmith reaped profits by 
breaking up and cutting costs at acquired businesses 
goldsmith also became embroiled in a lengthy bitter takeover 
battle for goodyear tire amp rubber co in 1986 that ended after the 
company undertook a major restructuring selling off most of its 
nontire businesses and agreed to buy goldsmiths goodyear stock 
which he sold at an estimated 87 million profit 
goldsmith was born in 1933 to a father who was a british member 
of parliament had taken a french wife and became a hotelier in 
france 
the young goldsmith went to eton the exclusive british boys 
boarding school he left in his midteens already having 
established a reputation for being an audacious gambler and later 
held jobs as a waiter and cook 
at the age of 20 he eloped with bolivian tin heiress isabel 
patino pursued by the worlds press and her enraged family they 
married in scotland she died in childbirth several months later 
goldsmith is married to his third wife lady annabel birley he 
has seven children 
tall mostly bald and blueeyed goldsmith has british and french 
passports he owns homes in london paris and new york and an 
estate in mexico 
descriptions of him have included such terms as charming 
petulant and meticulous 
although is descended from a german banking family he is a 
selfmade man who started out with little money of his own 
he had a variety of early business ventures selling diet aids 
starting shops catering to pregnant women with clothing and other 
products such as strollers and ultimately merging various food 
companies into one british group cavenham ltd 
in france he headed the general occidentale sa conglomerate 
which has interests in oil publishing and retailing including the 
grand union supermarket chain in the united states he sold most of 
his general occidentale holdings for an estimated 243 million about 
three months before world financial markets crashed in october 1987 
the times of london ranks goldsmith as britains 10th richest 
person with a fortune estimated at 12 billion 
goldsmith received his knighthood in 1976 from thenbritish prime 
minister harold wilson and has been awarded frances legion 
dhonneur

bat industries plcs strategy of diversifying away 
from its core tobacco business principally into financial services 
made it a tempting takeover and breakup target for a group led by 
anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith analysts said 
the group launched a 21 billion allsecurities offer on tuesday 
for bat the worlds biggest tobacco company the conglomerate 
quickly rejected the offer which is second in size only to this 
years 245 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc of the united states 
by the new york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
londonbased bat once known as britishamerican tobacco has 
been the target of takeover speculation partly because analysts 
consider the companys businesses worth more if sold off separately 
analysts estimate bats pieces could easily fetch more than 25 
billion compared with its stock market valuation of about 22 
billion based on its closing stock price tuesday 
it always has been a lowly rated stock because of its tobacco 
business and despite the recent sucessful farmers insurance 
purchase said charles pick an analyst with nomura research 
institute 
pick also said the financial communitys lower rating of bats 
tobacco business has been applied even to the companys other 
businesses which include retailing and paper manufacture 
earnings also have been variable in recent years because of 
exchange rate fluctuations pick said 
bruce davidson an analyst with smith new court plc said some of 
bats acquisitions have performed better than others but overall 
its diversification has been largely beneficial 
nevertheless goldsmith told a news conference tuesday that bats 
strategic error had been using the cash flow of its core tobacco 
business to buy businesses that are entirely unrelated 
the financial consequences of the diversification have been 
pedestrian earnings goldsmith said he and his partners now see 
restructuring as the only logical course to follow 
goldsmith said that by selling bats nontobacco businesses he 
intended to unlock shareholder value 
bat operates in about 90 countries and employs 310000 people 
bat chairman patrick sheehy spent more than 8 billion in the 
past five years buying financial services companies including 
general insurer eagle star hambro life renamed allied dunbar and 
canada trustco canadas seventh largest financial institution 
in its most recent acquisition bat took over los angelesbased 
farmers insurance group inc for 52 billion cash last year after a 
protracted takeover battle 
last year tobacco contributed less than 50 percent of bats 
profits for the first time 
sales of the tobacco busineses were flat at the equivalent of 11 
billion with operating profit of 12 billion also little changed 
bats cigarette brands include benson and hedges kool kent 
john player special lucky strike and viceroy 
its brand names in paper products are wiggins teape in europe and 
appleton in the united states 
bat also operates the saks fifth avenue marshall fields and 
argos stores 
bats aftertax earnings rose 21 percent to 155 billion in 
1988 while revenue rose 3 percent to 289 billion

flight attendants at united airlines have 
overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike the association of 
flight attendants said 
however the negotiations between the union and united are under 
the supervision of a federal mediator who would have to declare an 
impasse and call for a 30day coolingoff period before a strike 
could be called 
the negotiations which fall under the jurisdiction of the 
railway labor act are in recess the union said tuesday 
the union represents about 13500 united attendants and has been 
negotiating with the carrier for nearly two years 
one tentative agreement that included major concessions reached 
in november 1987 was rejected by the rank and file 
the association of flight attendants said 95 percent of the 9980 
ballots favored giving union leaders the authority to call a strike 
united also is involved in negotiations with its pilots and later 
this year is scheduled to open talks with the machinists union 
which represents mechanics and ground personnel

theyve seen their share of court battles 
over multibilliondollar takeovers before but the bailiffs at the 
public building had never seen a crowd as big as the one in town for 
a time inc hearing 
its unbelievable one guard said surveying the benches and 
aisles brimming with with reporters and stock arbitragers waiting 
for chancery court judge william t allen to begin a hearing tuesday 
over pivotal arguments in the threeway takeover battle over time 
the event showed signs of becoming the latest historic proceeding 
at the chancery court which dates back to colonial days and also is 
the court that hears cases involving guardianship of children the 
elderly and mentally incompetent 
a suitsandsuspenders crowd of about 120 people jammed benches 
and chairs in a superior court room the buildings biggest 
borrowed to handle the mob with another 75 lining the walls or 
sitting in the aisles 
the crowd was so big that that 35 people were shut out and 
stranded in the hallway those inside were warned they would lose 
their places to the outsiders if they left the courtroom 
that posed further complications for the arbitragers who are 
stock speculators betting on the outcome of the takeover fight 
involving time which wants to acquire warner communications inc 
and is trying to fend off hostile bidder paramount communications 
inc 
allen wouldnt allow the arbs who are accustomed to calling 
their offices via their cellular phones while following court 
hearings to bring the phones into the courtroom many of the 
speculators were afraid to leave the room for fear of losing their 
place to someone from the hallway 
the crush also was evident at wilmington hotels the night before 
the hearing a room service waitress at the radisson hotel said at 
11 pm that there had been 169 orders an unusually busy night 
and theyre still checking in she said 
but the time hearing wasnt the only activity keeping the public 
building busy tuesday 
be advised theres a sheriffs sale on the first floor said

a seattlebased partnership says it has developed 
a way to send both highdefinition television and standard broadcast 
signals on the bandwidths currently used to transmit conventional tv 
signals 
the development which would be a breakthrough in television 
technology could speed the arrival of the vastly improved pictures 
and sound available with hdtv but some industry analysts were 
skeptical of the claims 
officials of northwest starscan say their product will be 
marketed first to private companies that cant afford space on a 
satellite the first customers are expected to be signed in december 
we are not doing highdefinition television because there is 
no reason to now said starscan general partner a frederick 
greenberg citing the virtual lack of television sets on the market 
capable of receiving highdefinition signals 
however starscan spokesman wiley brooks said the company will be 
a major participant in hdtv when it is commercially viable 
starscan officials say they can compress a standard television 
broadcast signal to fit in a bandwidth onetenth the size it now 
requires on a satellite 
this enables the company to transmit at least 10 times as many 
pictures over a satellite channel without disrupting the tv signals 
the cost of using satellites could be reduced to onetenth they 
said 
we do the compression in a way that does not reduce the power 
of the signal there is no degradation of the signal said brooks 
currently hdtv signals cannot fit on a standard bandwidth 
because they require much more information than a regular television 
signal 
stephen roberts the companys chief financial officer said 
starscans technology compresses multiple broadcast signals into one 
signal that can be separated at the receiving end with almost nil 
degradation 
other companies developing compression technology such as zenith 
electronics corp are compressing a single broadcast signal he 
said 
bruce franca deputy chief of the federal communications 
commissions engineering and technology office said compressing 
individual signals to factors of 4to1 on satellite and 2to1 on 
cable can be done fairly regularly 
at first the company plans to go into pointofpurchase 
advertising in which televisions could be set up in department 
stores to advertise to consumers while they are in the store brooks 
said commercials could be broadcast tailormade for each 
department he said 
satellites and underground cables would not require modification 
to receive the compressed signal he said a compressed signal and a 
standard signal could be transmitted side by side in the same 
bandwidth he added 
the fccs said the company does not require the agencys approval 
for closedcircuit broadcasts 
the technology is a proprietary secret that has not been 
patented brooks said he said the patent had not yet been applied 
for so as not to give people a road map on how to do it 
other companies have developed compression technology but only 
with a reduction in picture quality 
the companys claims if proven true could have a tremendous 
impact in the telecommunications field analysts said but several 
were skeptical about starscans claims 
if you could carry a lot more information on the same spectrum 
and with the push today for hdtv it would be very beneficial the 
big question is can they do it said william hassinger assistant 
bureau chief of the fccs mass media bureau 
if they are achieving tenfold compression and theyre not going 
into hdtv they would be withholding from the industry something the 
industry has been on its knees begging for said dale cripps 
publisher of hdtv newsletter a portland orebased newsletter 
on highdefinition television 
i think its real neat stuff but the question is is their 
technology faster better cheaper than whats on the market said 
greg francfort telecommunications analyst at first boston corp in 
new york 
if its viable its damn valuable said dave willis 
director of engineering at denverbased telecommunications inc 
the nations largest cable television operator 
controlling interest in the company is held by greenberg and his 
brother richard greenberg frederick greenberg is chairman of first 
city national bank and trust co in new york 
the technology was purchased last year from from kent 
washbased northwest transforms inc which is now controlled by 
the greenbergs brooks said

the delay by major banks in following chase 
manhattan banks cut in the prime lending rate stems from 
uncertainty over the federal reserves monetary strategies as well 
as the summer vacation season economists say 
i guess well have to give it a few more days kathleen 
camilli a money market economist for drexel burnham lambert inc 
said tuesday 
chase stood alone among the nations large moneycenter banks 
monday in trimming its prime rate a half percentage point to 105 
percent the second such decline in as many months and the level at 
which the prime stood at the start of the year 
other major banks generally were expected to follow the move 
which chase said reflected its own declining costs of borrowing 
but had not done so by late tuesday 
reflecting the banks dropping costs of funds the average yield 
on sixmonth certificates of deposit fell to 879 percent last week 
from 884 percent the previous week thirtyyear fixed mortgage 
rates dropped to an average 1017 percent a 14month low according 
to hsh associates a butler njbased mortgage research firm 
in addition the treasurys bellwether 30year bond dipped to 
797 percent at one point tuesday the lowest level since april 8 
1987 according to camilli before closing up at 803 percent 
the prime a laggard among other interest rates is a benchmark 
banks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and business 
credit including homeequity lines of credit it also determines 
the rate for many credit cards 
economists said tuesday that other banks undoubtedly have seen 
reductions in their cost of funds in recent weeks but that they 
probably want to wait until the federal reserve further eases its 
credit policies before they cut their prime rates 
the fed has shown signs of loosening its grip on the nations 
money supply in reaction to a continued slowdown in economic growth 
and an easing of inflation 
the federal funds rate which reflects the feds credit moves 
dipped as low as 8 percent last week after hovering around 9 
percent but economists said most banks probably wont cut their 
prime until fed funds remains firmly at the 9 percent level fed 
funds the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans 
closed at 9 316 percent late tuesday 
some economists also said slow summer business may have delayed 
widespread prime cuts 
i think they are dragging their feet in lowering the prime 
because activity has dropped off a little bit this summer and one 
way of earning profits is to keep the spread wide said ward 
mccarthy an economist and principal with stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc 
when rates drop banks tend to lag whereas theyre much quicker 
to increase the prime when rates are rising he said 
by spread mccarthy means the difference between the banks cost 
of borrowing and lending money 
some economists said prime cut delays also might be due to the 
fact that a number of key decision makers at the major banks are on 
vacation 
i know at least one bank where thats true said one source 
at chase 
elliott platt an economist with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities corp said the fed probably will push the fed funds rate 
to 9 percent once a spate of new economic data is released later 
this month 
the producer price index industrial production retail sales and 
capacity utilization figures for june are scheduled for release 
friday and many analysts predicted those numbers would point to a 
further economic slowing

on the same day that it fought to retain its 
independence from an unwanted suitor in a delaware courtroom time 
inc announced plans to launch a new magazine entertainment weekly 
in february 1990 
time executives insisted that is was coincidence that the 
magazine announcement came on the same day as tuesdays 
widelyanticipated chancery court hearing on paramount 
communications incs request for an order blocking times proposed 
acquisition of warner communications inc 
paramount is making its own bid for time 
nonetheless the launch of entertainment weekly would be times 
first new weekly since the costly failure of its cable tv guide six 
years ago 
the new magazine has been under study for nearly two years time 
said and will contain reviews and reporting on television movies 
video music and books times other weeklies are time people and 
sports illustrated 
reginald k brack jr the head of the time inc magazine co 
said the new magazine will capitalize on what he called an explosion 
of interest in entertainment by focusing on products rather than 
personalities 
the company said the american appetite for such material is 
clear americans watch almost seven hours a day of television and 
each year rent 2 billion videocassettes buy more than a billion 
movie tickets spend 8 billion on popular books and 43 billion on 
electronic equipment and buy more than 750 million records tapes 
and compact disks 
time declined to disclose how much it is investing in the launch 
of entertainment weekly but some industry observers said they 
expect it would require at least 20 million 
time lost about 47 million in connection with its tvcable week 
which was launched in april 1983 and folded five months later 
after that costly experience some analysts said time became more 
conservative in approaching new magazines 
it has invested as a partner in several magazines developed by 
others including a 50 percent stake in a joint venture that 
publishes working woman and working mother magazines it confirmed 
tuesday that it plans to sell its stake to its partner in that 
project dale w lang for a reported 25 million 
over the past 18 months time has been involved with two 
launches its southern progress inc subsidiary started cooking 
light magazine and time more recently launched sports illustrated 
for kids a monthly sports magazine 
but time has not tried a national launch of a weekly magazine 
since tvcable week folded its executives note that no one has 
successfully launched a weekly in the united states since times 
people magazine debuted in 1974 
brack said no comparisons should be drawn between entertainment 
weekly and tvcable week which was a tv listings guide distributed 
and marketed mainly through cable system operators 
he said entertainment weekly will cover a broad range of 
entertainment topics wont carry tv listings and will be marketed 
by time itself 
michael moore worldwide media director at the advertising agency 
darcy masius benton amp bowles said he thinks the magazine has a 
good chance for success since people are spending more on 
experiences than they ever have 
publisher michael j klingensmith who has been testing reaction 
to this type of magazine through direct mailings said entertainment 
weekly will start with a circulation of 500000 and expects more 
than 80 percent of the magazines will be sold through subscriptions 
at 1 a copy the newstand price will be 195 a copy 
managing editor jeff jarvis who is now the tv critic for people 
said the magazine will have its own roster of critics who will 
review movies video television music and books he said other 
critics including professionals readers and entertainers also will 
appear along with stories describing what goes on behind the scenes 
in shows songs and books 
one sample cover for instance called attention to a story on 
how they make a james bond action scene

corporate raider t boone pickens is one of the few 
americans to have experienced firsthand one of the stranger 
traditions of capitalism in japan the battle of sokaiya or 
professional hecklers versus loyal company employees at annual 
shareholders meetings 
the texas oilman is a major shareholder in a japanese auto parts 
maker called koito manufacturing co and when he came to tokyo last 
week he experienced the most unusual shareholders meeting ive 
ever attended in my life 
toughlooking men in flashy suits and tightly permed hair filled 
the room along with mildmannered employees in white shirts and 
neckties and the lone texan 
pickens made a pitch for increasing shareholders rights and 
improving profits 
a number of other shareholders backed him up but their style was 
different from pickens courteous drawl 
in threatening cadences reminiscent of movie yakuza or 
gangsters the sokaiya repeated some of pickens points threw in a 
bunch of their own and badgered the visibly shaken management of 
koito for an hour an a half 
hey you shouted one young man at the president of the 
company what kind of education are you giving your employees i 
passed 10 of them on the way in this morning and only two said good 
morning is that any way to treat a shareholder huh 
profits are down said another in tones so velvety it was 
almost scary it really doesnt appear that youre putting out 
much effort 
finally an older man who identified himself as part of the japan 
youth society an ultrarightwing group gave a virtuoso 
performance he began in a soft throaty voice like marlon brandos 
in the godfather and ended with a ringing gutterlanguage parody 
of pundits criticizing japans lack of international spirit and its 
recent scandals linking businessmen and politicians 
pickens later praised the hecklers i thought they asked some 
very good questions he said still he admitted thats an 
interesting way to ask for an income statement 
police say the sokaiya who use their legal rights as 
shareholders to attend meetings have ties to the underworld if 
they arent paid off they harrass management with endless questions 
and occasionally threaten violence employeeshareholders turn out 
in force to defend management against the attack 
the ritual battle between employees and shareholders symbolizes a 
basic conflict for japanese companies just who does the company 
belong to 
the traditional japanese notion is that it belongs to the 
management and employees who devote their lives to the company 
companies are very warm to their workers japanese capitalism 
has got almost communistic elements to it when you think about 
it says masakazu kobayashi one of japans few shareholders 
rights activists 
but by american concepts of capitalism and at least legally 
speaking in japan a company belongs to its owners in the case of a 
publicly listed company thats the shareholders 
as koitos largest shareholder pickens asked for representation 
on its board of directors though he owns onefifth of the company 
he was denied a seat 
now hes complaining to washington that americans dont have the 
same access to investment in japan as japanese have in the united 
states 
japanese businessmen admit they largely ignore individual 
shareholders domestic as well as foreign about 90 percent of 
companies hold shareholders meetings on the same day to discourage 
attendance dividends are widely considered money down the drain and 
are generally kept low 
but many japanese managers argue that emphasizing employees 
rather than owners and reinvesting in research and better factories 
rather than paying out dividends is the secret of their success 
pickens arguments won support in a number of editorials in 
leading newspapers pickens says that japan should increase 
shareholders rights in effect emphasize shortterm profits and 
encourage mergers and acquisitions because it would be good for 
the economy 
but many investors in the booming tokyo stock market have been 
making a killing in capital gains over the past few years and dont 
really care about having a voice in management or in collecting 
dividends 
pickens argues that managers have a responsibility to 
shareholders to show regular profit growth when a manager starts 
talking about investing in the longterm future i ask when is 
the payoff when is someday he said 
many japanese managers think ignoring quarterly profits for the 
long view is essential to growth and think pickens kind of 
impatience is what has led to an american failure to invest in the 
future 
finally pickens argues that weak shareholders lead to lazy 
unaccountable management poor corporate performance and a sluggish 
economy 
the problem is thats a little hard to see in japan

the us dollar finished higher today against the 
japanese yen while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange edged 
down 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 4525 
points or 013 percent ending at 3370152 the index a 
7075point gainer tuesday added 6666 points in early trading 
the dollar ended at 14050 yen gaining 088 yen from tuesdays 
13962yen close the currency opened at 14070 yen and moved 
slightly downward while ranging between 14040 yen and 14095 yen 
the dollars strength followed its uptrend in new york overnight 
but trading in tokyo was directionless traders said 
masafumi koyama a bank of tokyo trader said the us unit 
which reached the days high at 14095 yen during the early session 
gradually fell in the afternoon as participants sold the dollar for 
technical position adjustments 
the dollars rise was halted by the bank of japans 
dollarselling intervention he said 
tokyo was lacking fresh marketaffecting news and investors 
were unable to determine the appropriate level of their 
dollarholding positions koyama said 
he added that japanese investors were hardly paying attention to 
the nations trade report for june released late in the afternoon 
wednesday 
japans june trade surplus with the united states totaled 3634 
billion up from 3622 billion a year earlier 
on the stock exchange the index fell in part because of the 
yens weakness against the dollar dealers said 
market players were reluctant to buy despite the downward trend 
in us interest rates because of political uncertainties ahead of 
a july 23 parliamentary election said a dealer with the new japan 
securities co 
it is widely expected that the ruling liberal democratic party 
will lose badly in the upcoming upper house election the party has 
been hurt by an influencepeddling stock scandal an unpopular 3 
percent consumption tax and prime minister sousuke unos reported 
involvement with paid mistresses 
investors avoid buying due to fears that the ruling partys 
election loss will result in a market plunge 
trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 600 
million shares up from tuesdays 550 million among the winners

housesenate negotiators attempting to craft a 
compromise savings and loan bailout are off to a slow start with 
some house members complaining about the unwieldiness of their 
94member delegation 
the point is we dont know what were doing here rep stan 
parris rva complained at one moment of confusion in tuesdays 
session 
sen donald riegle dmich who is leading a leaner team of five 
senators tried to persuade the house side to agree to delete 11 to 
17 special interest provisions each affecting one or a handful 
of companies 
but the house balked even though it had already deleted the 
special interest sections before passing its own bill last month 
because of the way the house delegation is organized it was unable 
to consider the provisions as a group 
the chairman of the house banking committee rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas has divided his conferees into platoons of 20 to 
30 members with each group handling one part of the legislation 
it would take the house staff at least two three hours to 
figure out the jurisdiction on the special interest package 
gonzalez said 
there was more evidence of disarray as members of one house 
platoon attempted to raise issues already addressed by another 
platoon at one point house and senate conferees found themselves 
working from different documents and unsure of what they were voting 
on prompting parris complaint 
i have never seen anything quite like this in my 15 years in 
congress said rep carroll hubbard dky its confusing to say 
the least 
but rep charles schumer dny said major conference 
committees typically start slow and then build steam 
gonzalez has said he organized his delegation in order to dilute 
the influence of senior members who bucked the majority in the 
house on many issues to support sampl interests he said tuesday that 
the test of his system will be whether the conferees finish the work 
carved out for them each day so far they have 
among the deals struck 
a special justice department antifraud task force will be 
established in dallas the house also wanted a task force in 
southern california but compromised with the senate which wanted 
neither 
conferees adopted the house section providing the justice 
department with 75 million a year to detect and prosecute bank and 
sampl fraud the senate had voted to spend 50 million a year 
the house side on a 137 vote defeated a move by rep frank 
annunzio dill to delete provisions for dozens of special 
studies he complained they would be costly and most members of 
congress would be unlikely to read them 
employees including political appointees of the federal home 
loan bank board which is being broken up in a regulatory 
reorganization will have their jobs protected for a year or get 
severance pay 
a provision to give the federal deposit insurance corp which 
under the bill guarantees bank and sampl accounts up to 100000 the 
authority to secondguess the decisions of other commercial bank 
regulators was scrapped 
on the special interest provisions house and senate staff 
members had substantially worked out which would be deleted 
but some conferees including reps doug barnard dga and 
barney frank dmass and sens jake garn rutah and alan 
cranston dcalif argued the provisions ought to be considered 
onebyone 
it may be public interest as well as special interest to 
consider the problems of individual institutions cranston said 
riegle said he wants the conferees to finish by july 18 more 
than soon enough for the full house and senate to ratify the package 
and send it to president bush before leaving for their august 
vacation

merrill lynch amp cos new london conn office illegally obtained 
copies of the magazine from march 1986 to july 1988 
the lawsuit mentions but does not name others who allegedly 
traded on the information supplied by dillon including a merrill 
lynch colleague two clients a bank and a bank executive who all 
allegedly made money in the scheme 
three brokers at the investment firm then known as ef hutton 
and two unnamed advest inc brokers also allegedly bought the stocks 
after being tipped off by a highschool friend of dillons the 
lawsuit claims 
sec officials declined to name the other people and would not 
comment on whether further action would be taken in the case

libera dillons highschool friend liberas brother todd and 
francis r sablone jr an attorney

companies favorably discussed in the business week column making 
141591 he also made another 82016 from trading in a partnership 
account according to the suit 
the government contends that on thursday mornings dillon paid 
either 20 for the business week column or 30 for the full magazine 
to various employees of rr donnelley amp sons co which prints the 
weekly publication at two plants in connecticut several donnelley 
employees were fired in the wake of the scandal 
dillon benjamin libera and sometimes sablone met at a diner in 
old saybrook conn early thursdays to discuss the column and 
decide what stocks to buy and sell according to the lawsuit 
after telling his mother about the scheme baird in march 1987 
opened an account with a discount brokerage and her son called her 
on thursday mornings to tell her what stocks to trade the suit

princetonnewport partners sold and then bought 
back blocks of securities at the end of 1984 for the purchase price 
plus a consistent 625cent commission a federal prosecutor said in 
the first securities racketeering trial 
crossexamining former princetonnewport managing partner james 
sutton regan assistant us attorney mark hansen sought to 
demonstrate that the deals were prearranged and in violation of 
federal tax and securities laws 
regan one of six defendants in the case repeatedly denied that 
the partnership had contracts with investment firms to buy back 
securities at prearranged prices 
also charged are four other princetonnewport officials and a 
former drexel burnham lambert inc trader the case has attracted 
wide interest because the defendants were the first securities 
executives charged under the federal racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations law 
hansen listed a series of late december 1984 transactions in 
which princetonnewport sold corporate bonds to merrill lynch amp co 
and bought them back a few days later at the same price plus 116 
or 625 cents the deals were arranged by princetonnewport partner 
paul a berkman 
isnt it a fact that mr berkman was told up front that it was 
going to be 6 cents hansen asked 
i have no knowledge of that regan said 
the government is seeking to show that such a securities 
parking arrangement is illegal if it involved a predetermined 
buyback date and price hansen said the 625 cent increase in the 
buyback price indicated a set deal 
the indictment in the case contends princetonnewports 
executives engaged in a racketeering conspiracy through bogus 
securities trades to generate millions of dollars in false tax 
losses 
regan has testified the firm arranged securities transactions but 
without set buyback prices to generate shortterm losses for tax 
purposes he testified under questioning from his lawyer that he 
believed the deals were legal 
also on trial are princetonnewport general partners charles 
zarzecki and jack z rabinowitz the firms controller steven b 
smotrich and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg 
the jury trial is being held before us district judge robert 
carter 
princetonnewport was a small securities firm with offices in 
princeton nj and newport beach calif that went out of 
business after the indictment was brought last august

washington state university researchers 
want to find out whether a japanese breed of cattle known as wagyu 
can be raised profitably in the united states 
a yes answer could mean high stakes to beef producers in 
washington and elsewhere who potentially could make hefty profits 
producing beef for the lucrative japanese restaurant market 
we are shipping some of our prime beef over there now said 
jerry reeves a wsu animal scientist involved in the wagyu project 
we get about 4 a pound for it their wagyu cattle bring in 10 to 
40 a pound 
the highest grade wagyu carcasses fetch as much as 16000 in 
japan about twice as much as the average carcass price in the 
united states reeves said in a news release this week 
its a niche market but at a different level there may be a 
market for wagyu crossbreds which japan cannot produce 
economically said ray wright a wsu animal physiologist heading 
the research project we also might have a market for wagyu beef 
in japanese restaurants in the united states 
the scientists want to find out if wagyu beef animals can be bred 
in the united states profitably to meet japanese preference for 
erxtremely tender cuts used in sukiyaki and other japanese dishes in 
which the beef is cooked in boiling water 
us beef carcasses are a poor substitute because the fat tends 
to concentrate on the outside whereas wagyu carcasses have a high 
degree of marbling in the muscle said wright 
if you drop our select grade beef into boiling water it comes 
out tough reeves added the interior fat of the wagyu beef 
protects it when it hits the water and makes it tender 
the wsu researchers have applied for permission to import live 
wagyu cattle embryos and semen from japan but wright said he is 
not optimistic about getting approval anytime soon 
you have to understand that the japanese control the market for 
wagyu right now he said i think theyll be reluctant to allow 
export of their animals 
as they await a response the scientists have been negotiating 
with a texas cattleman to buy a couple of wagyu heifers the owner 
might be the only person to possess wagyus outside of japan his 
animals are descendants of four wagyu bulls imported to the united 
states in the early 1970s 
once the scientists acquire some cattle they plan to breed them 
by embryo transfer processes that would be the first step in 
finding out exactly what us cattleman have to do to rear the 
cattle profitably 
even if they can gain access to the japanese market us beef 
producers will have to adapt their production systems to accommodate 
the japanese cattle the wsu researchers say 
us cattlemen feed large numbers of animals all they can eat 
to finish them out in 120 days reeves said japanese cattlemen 
he said feed no more than six wagyu at a time and dont market them 
until they are four years old 
well probably have to feed them the same amount of time 
reeves said but it wont be economical to massage the animals and 
feed them beer as is the custom in japan

japans world trade surplus narrowed 11 percent 
overall in june but continued to widen against its largest trading 
partner the united states finance ministry officials reported 
wednesday 
japan posted an unadjusted trade surplus of 5290 billion last 
month down from 5950 billion a year earlier but up from 3760 
billion in may 
the trade surplus with the united states grew 03 percent to 
3634 billion from 3622 billion a year earlier 
exports to the united states grew 79 percent to 7931 billion 
while imports from the united states rose 153 percent to 4297 
billion the report said 
the trade figures in june brought japans surplus in the first 
six months of 1989 to 3350 billion down slightly from 337 
billion in the same period last year 
ministry officials attributed the wider trade surplus from may to 
june to a 3percent consumption tax that forced importers to buy 
more before the new tax took effect april 1 
from a year earlier however both exports and imports showed 
moderate growth though imports grew faster 
exports of products like machinery nonferrous metals 
television sets video tape recorders and semiconductors were brisk 
while japan imported more of us goods such as meat lumber and 
pulp business machines audio equipment semiconductors 
nonferrous metals cars and steel 
steel imports from the united states for instance jumped 2124 
percent from the yearearlier month to 19768 billion 
in june the government report said the yen declined against the 
dollar making the value of yendenominated shipments smaller when 
calculated in dollar terms the dollar was valued at an average 
14306 yen in june a slight gain from 14306 yen a year earlier 
due to japans economic expansion that accompanied personal 
consumption and corporate equipment investment imports of 
manufactured goods remained strong accounting for 499 percent of 
overall imports in june 
in the first half of 1989 oil prices were generally lower 
although they began rising in may and june and pushed up overall 
import figures 
in addition to the introduction of the consumption tax finance 
ministry officials said the death of emperor hirohito in january 
and his funeral and other services in the following months dampened 
business activities of many companies and hurt the countrys trade

smithkline beckman corp awaiting a vote on 
a planned merger with beecham group plc announced its 
secondquarter profit is expected to rise about 7 percent over the 
same period last year 
the pharmaceutical company announced tuesday its operating income 
is expected to increase by 30 percent to 35 percent sales by about 
10 perecent and earnings per share to 92 cents to 95 cents up from 
79 cents in the second quarter of 1988 
net earnings are expected to increase at a lower rate than 
operating income because of interest expenses exchange losses and 
other nonoperating expenses smithkline said 
the preliminary estimate was released before a scheduled july 26 
meeting during which shareholders will vote on the proposed merger 
between smithkline and beecham group forming smithkline beecham 
beecham shareholders approved the merger june 20 
therapeutics sales are expected to increase about 10 percent in 
the second quarter operating income for therapeutics is expected to 
be up 40 percent to 45 percent mainly because of slower growth in 
operating expenses and improved sales of tagamet and dyazide two of 
smithklines most popular products 
us sales of those two drugs were weak during last years second 
quarter 
beckman instruments sales are expected to be about 3 percent 
higher than sales of the same quarter last year operating income is 
expected to rise about 10 percent while net income is expected to 
drop about 6 percent 
that decline is primarily due to interest expense related to 
longterm debt incurred as part of beckmans recapitalization in the 
third quarter of 1988 and exchange losses 
clinical laboratory services sales are projected to be up about 
19 percent in the quarter operating income is expected to rise 
about 12 percent

incentive packages on most of general motors 
corps cars and trucks have been boosted or extended in what one 
analyst says may be the worst thing that the industry could do 
gm issued new incentive offers for its chevrolet pontiac buick 
and oldsmobile cars on tuesday and for gmc trucks today cash 
rebates range from 500 to 1500 depending on the model or a 
buyer may choose financing ranging between 29 percent to 109 
percent depending on the term of the loan 
all are effective today and run indefinitely except for 
financing deals on chevrolet cars and trucks which expire sept 27 
auto industry analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co in 
new york said manufacturers may sacrifice future sales by using 
generous incentives now 
the reason why we think the amplification in incentive activity 
is bad is that you are going to take away some buyers from the 
fourth quarter and early next year kirnan said today 
late last week before gms announcements kirnan said the 
worst thing that could happen is that if the industry would raise 
the incentive activity chrysler corps current incentive program 
runs indefinitely and ford motor cos expires at the end of this 
month 
automakers have been wrestling with a threepronged problem this 
year sales below expectations overly ambitious production 
schedules and incentives that have lost their luster all that has 
added up to larger than desired dealer newcar inventories 
these things combined with expectations that interest rates will 
drop further in the near future might make the autumn a better time 
to buy a car economists say 
incentives have been used on and off all year with the biggest 
push being made during the spring within days of each other in late 
march and early april of this year gm ford and chrysler announced 
incentive programs that increased the number of qualified vehicles 
boosted cash rebates and drastically lowered interest rates 
but sale figures through the secondquarter of the year and into 
the third quarter indicated the enticements werent boosting sales 
to expectations and vehicles were getting backlogged on dealer lots 
the eight major domestic automakers had sold 19 percent fewer cars 
and light trucks during the first half of this year compared with 
the same time last year 
according to this weeks wards automotive reports dealers for 
those companies had a 75day supply of cars on hand at the current 
selling rate on june 30 the same level as they had two years ago 
but far above the 60day supply at the same time last year 
those companies made 726 percent of all the new cars sold during 
the first six months of this year and 721 percent last year 
typically inventories of imported cars are smaller 
gm dealers had a newcar inventory of 79 days at the end of last 
month ford had a 78day supply and chryslers inventory was at 79 
days wards said

soybean futures prices for july delivery recovered 
slightly after falling sharply in early trading today on the chicago 
board of trade following the exchanges emergency order requiring 
traders to reduce their holdings in that contract 
prices of other soybean contracts were moderately lower while the 
corn and wheat markets were down slightly oat futures advanced 
the board of trade issued the emergency order late tuesday to 
break up an apparent attempt by one large company to corner the 
soybean market officials have not named the company 
the july soybean contract tumbled 31 cents a bushel on heavy 
selling at the opening analysts attributed much of that selling to 
major grain companies holding large commitments to take delivery of 
soybeans in july 
but the losses were quickly trimmed apparently on buying by 
other parties holding large commitments to deliver soybeans in july 
the exchanges emergency order applies to those in either position 
its kind of wild and wooly here said gerald zusel manager 
of floor operations for the trading company balfour maclaine corp 
activity was relatively light in the other markets as traders 
exercised caution ahead of this afternoons agriculture department 
report on planted crop acreage 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 390 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to 1 cents lower with july at 257 a bushel oats were 1 cent to

up 3 a share to 14925 analysts said the gain likely was a 
response to tuesdays sharp declne 
warner stock was down 25 cents to 6262 a share in early 
trading today and paramount was up 25 cents to 5825 a share 
the attorneys for paramount and the shareholders contended 
tuesday that times directors violated their duty in refusing to let 
shareholders vote on paramounts 200ashare bid 
the lawyers claimed that the time board effectively put the 
company up for sale when it agreed to a stockswap merger with 
warner in march under delaware law if a company is up for sale 
its board must entertain any bids that would fetch the most money 
for shareholders 
melvyn cantor representing paramount charged that time 
officials knew they were opening the company up to possible bids 
when they included a provision in the merger agreement with warner 
calling for an exchange of stock between the two companies 
michael r klein an attorney representing texas investor robert 
m bass and other major time shareholders said the exchange was 
done to defend the transaction 
klein said of times directors when they made that choice to 
pursue the merger with warner they were quite substantially aware 
that the marketplace would supply alternatives 
time attorney robert joffee dismissed kleins arguments the 
mere possibility that someone might make a bid even the making of 
a bid does not put a company into play he said 
the paramount and shareholder attorneys repeatedly asked allen to 
allow the holders of time stock to vote on the paramount offer 
sherri r savett also representing stockholders argued that 
they should be allowed to vote on the two offers because they stood 
to lose a lot of money if the timewarner merger succeeded and the 
paramount bid failed 
joffee countered that if the paramount offer does fall through 
it would happen because paramounts bid remains subject to a number 
of conditions including obtaining regulatory approvals to operate 
times cable television systems 
warner attorney charles richards said it was warner and not 
paramount shareholders who had the most to lose the failure of the 
time bid would send warner stock tumbling and open the company up to 
an unwanted bid richards said 
time and warner had planned to submit their original merger plan 
to their shareholders but the companies changed the agreement in 
response to the paramount bid to the tender offer by time for 
warner stock 
the attorneys for time and warner told the judge the directors 
did not violate their duty to shareholders because delaware law does 
not require the board to submit either paramounts offer or the 
warner bid to a vote 
joffee contended the company never was for sale he said the 
proposed merger of time and warner was the result of longterm 
business planning and said the law did not require the company to 
shift its strategy because it receives an apparently lucrative bid 
he said time also doesnt have to submit the warner deal to a 
vote because it does not require the dilution of time stock 
the courtroom was filled to overflowing with 120 spectators 
mostly reporters and stock arbitragers who are speculating on the 
outcome of the takeover battle many stood against walls or crouched 
in the aisles 
the crowd was so big that about 30 people were shut out and 
forced to wait in the hallway and it so strained the air 
conditioning system that allen invited lawyers at one point in the 
5hour hearing to take off their jackets 
many arbitragers were unable to confer with their offices during 
the hearing because they were not allowed to bring cellular 
telephones into the courtroom and couldnt leave the room for fear 
of losing their place to someone from the hallway 
allens decision which undoubtedly will be appealed to delaware 
supreme court could decide the outcome of the threeway struggle 
for time and could affect the future of friendly mergers in the 
future as many of the nations largest companies are incorporated

a public controversy has flared in 
this densely populated nation over a government study that 
recommends banning virtually all daytime car and truck traffic in 
the event of a serious smog emergency 
the study which follows one of the netherlands worst bouts of 
trafficinduced smog last month was criticized by one business 
group as an attempt to shut down the netherlands inc by 
disrupting the vital trucking industry 
the government study presented to environment minister ed 
nijpels on tuesday contained the first detailed plan on how 
authorities should respond if parts of the country are hit by 
dangerously high smog levels in the future 
in the harshest of the proposed measures the study suggested 
provincial governors should halt all car and truck traffic in their 
areas from 6 am to midnight and allow only emergency vehicles and 
doctors on the roads 
the measure would be enforced by closing down dozens of bridges 
and tunnels effectively crippling traffic in this nation 
crisscrossed by rivers and canals according to the amsterdam 
newspaper trouw 
if such a measure ever took effect it would be the first driving 
ban since 1974 when the government banned all but emergency driving 
on sundays in a response to an arab oil embargo imposed for the 
netherlands strong support for israel 
marijke brunt of the nature and environment foundation this 
nations most prominent green lobby group said on wednesday that 
she was extremely pleased with the government study 
however if you halt all traffic you effectively shut down the 
netherlands inc said marcel braakman of the royal dutch 
association of entrepreneurs 
braakman predicted widespread disruption to commuter traffic and 
supplies ranging from groceries to building materials if the 
proposals were ever to come into effect 
the evo trucking organization said that the antismog measures 
would cause gigantic economic damage 
the rotterdam newspaper algemeen dagblad based in the worlds 
largest port complained in an editorial that the proposed measures 
would hit some branches of dutch industry disproportionately 
hard 
in last months emergency concentrations of toxic nitrous oxides 
and ozone reached dangerous highs in at least five dutch provinces 
while an orange haze settled over the nation doctors and hospitals 
reported the elderly and asthma patients were having serious 
breathing problems 
a fresh breeze from the north sea cleared the putrid air after a 
few days but nijpels convened an emergency meeting with the 
governors of the two worst affected provinces to decide on possible 
measures 
last may the centerright government of premier ruud lubbers 
became the first in the western world to fall over an environmental 
issue the funding of a plan to clean up the heavily polluted 
environment within a generation 
ms brunt dismissed criticism of the government smog study as 
ridiculous 
suddenly everybody in the business world has lost interest 
in the environment when it was the hottest topic around before 
she said

the united mine workers union today 
extended a sanctioned work stoppage for two more days meaning about 
60000 coal miners east of the mississippi river will be off their 
jobs at least through friday 
howard green international executive board member from umw 
district 17 said the contractually permitted memorial period is 
being extended to give the pittston co more time to respond to a 
request by virginias governor that the company and the union resume 
negotiations 
unfortunately in southwest virginia where the primary 
purpose of the law appears to be the defense of corporate privilege 
at the expense of individual liberty the conditions which led to 
this protest have if anything gotten worse umw president 
richard trumka said in a news release 
telephone calls to the office of pittston spokeswoman susan 
copeland in lebanon va were not immediately returned 
the memorial period called last week originally was intended to 
end at midnight tonight since being called violence has continued 
in the coal fields and state police beefed up patrols 
more than 37000 umw members in eight states have been on wildcat 
strikes in support of 1900 miners on striking the pittston co in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky 
in alabama police said up to six shots were fired today at a 
coalloading facility where union miners were harassing nonunion 
haulers a shot fired from 300to400 yards away struck a coal truck 
but no injuries were reported officers said 
about 30 state troopers were assigned to the southern west 
virginia coal fields tuesday after rockthrowing and other violence 
primarily in raleigh boone mingo and logan counties 
lt col gr young said the violence amounted to just about 
the same thing that has been going on during the past few weeks a 
few rocks being thrown some broken windows some flattened tires 
in boone county state police responded late tuesday evening to 
the campt coal co at nellis where two trucks and a bulldozer were on 
fire 
trooper rl richard said no injuries were reported 
in washington rep william clay dmo said the house 
subcommittee on labor management relations will begin an 
investigation into the pittston strike 
given the length of the strike the number of workers involved 
the protracted involvement of both the state and federal courts and 
the potential effect of the strike on the economy i believe it is 
time for a congressional investigation of the matter clay said 
a national labor relations board regional office filed complaints 
friday against both the umw and pittston 
pittson was accused of unfair labor practices such as coercion 
and bad faith bargaining a position that if upheld would bar the 
company from hiring permanent replacements for the striking union 
members 
the union the complaint said has engaged in illegal picket 
activity 
both the union and pittston said they will fight the complaints 
umw president richard trumka last week called for a threeday 
memorial period for union miners east of the mississippi to stay 
off the job through today 
the us energy information agency reported that us coal 
production fell 35 percent in eastern coal fields during the week 
ending july 1 production in west virginia was down 37 percent from 
prestrike levels from 3 million tons a week before the wildcat 
strikes began to 19 million tons 
that reduced production has meant few or no shipments to power 
plants that burn coal 
virginia power co spokeswoman karen russell said her company 
normally maintains stockpiles of enough coal to burn for 35 to 65 
days and were now at about the midpoint 
the utility which produces 45 percent of its power from 
coalburning plants has 17 million customers in virginia and north 
carolina 
american electric power co the nations largest coal customer 
has seen its stockpile drop from about 70 days to 65 said spokesman 
carl crawford 
were not down significantly crawford said were getting 
some fuel supply deliveries but at reduced levels 
american electric powers eight operating divisions serve 7 
million customers in ohio west virgina indiana kentucky 
michigan virginia and tennessee 
trumka said tuesday he was accepting a request by virginia gov 
gerald baliles that the union and pittston resume negotiations under 
the supervision of a federal mediator with trumka and pittston 
chairman paul douglas heading the negotiating teams 
pittston coal group president michael odom said the company had 
no comment on the proposal at the appropriate time well make a 
response odom said 
pittston which has demanded cutbacks that the union fears would 
set an industrywide precedent has rejected other requests that the 
two sides resume talks or that douglas become personally involved in 
the negotiations 
in charleston us district judge dennis knapp indefinitely 
postponed strikerelated proceedings in his court 
i thought it might very well help the situation if all legal 
proceedings are suspended for the time being knapp said i 
dont want to impede those who are trying to end these strikes

fannie mae reported wednesday that earnings 
soared 60 percent in the second quarter as yields increased on its 
mortgage portfolio and fee income rose 
fannie mae formally known as the federal national mortgage 
association is a congressionally chartered shareholderowned 
company that provides money for homebuyers by purchasing mortgages 
from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to 
investors 
fannie maes earnings totaled 1930 million or 228 per share 
on interest income of 27 billion for the three months ended june 
30 that compared with a profit of 1207 million or 153 a share 
on interest income of 254 billion in the 1988 quarter 
for the first six months of 1989 fannie mae earned 3582 
million or 427 per share on total interest income of 535 
billion the same period last year fannie mae earned 2216 million 
or 282 a share on total interest income of 498 billion 
fannie mae president roger birk attributed the sharp rise in 
secondquarter earnings to a widening in the spread between the 
interest the company earns on its investment portfolio and what it 
pays on its debt 
another factor was an increase in income from fees charged 
lenders for guaranteeing morgage backed securities he said 
fannie mae purchased 45 billion in mortgages in the second 
quarter up from 34 billion in the first but down from 69 
billion a year ago

spanish securities regulators are 
investigating a unit of the us brokerage firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc over allegations it misrepresented itself in the stock 
sale of the petroleum giant repsol sa a report published 
wednesday said 
the newspaper el pais quoted unnamed sources from the national 
securities commission as alleging that last spring drexel sold 
repsol shares intended for small investors to a few large private 
institutions 
the newspapers sources said drexel requested an estimated 598 
million in shares of the statecontrolled repsol to be sold to 400 
investors but they claimed that on may 11 the first day of public 
trading drexel improperly sold the shares to a small number of 
large private investors the newspaper said 
there was no comment on the report at drexels spanish office 
however repsol issued a statement late wednesday denying drexel 
formed part of the syndicate of 48 brokerages or investment firms 
that took part in the stock sale 
drexel burnham lambert did not form part of the offering thus 
there has been no relation at all between that firm and repsol it 
said repsol has cooperated since the start of the commissions 
investigation in early june and based on its outcome will then 
take the appropriate legal action 
between april 20 and may 6 repsol europes eighthlargest 
petroleum company sold 7975 million shares at 1470 each to 
400000 shareholders worldwide 
the company sold 44 million of the total shares offered to 
individual spanish shareholders under a prorated system 
el pais said the sources confirmed the commission had contacted 
at least 10 of the 400 investors drexel had identified as original 
buyers they said they knew nothing about ordering the purchase of 
repsol shares 
el pais said if drexel used the names of investors without their 
consent the brokerage could face criminal fraud charges 
the secretary of the nsc president luis carlos croissier said 
there was no one available to comment on the newspaper report 
in the united states drexel recently agreed to plead guilty to 
charges involving securities fraud violations stemming from the 
insider trading scandals linked to the nowjailed speculator ivan f 
boesky drexel also agreed to pay 650 million in penalties

strike by the writers guild of america for forcing up prime time 
programming costs he said the cbs television networks operating 
income dropped as a result 
the cbs broadcast group recorded an 11 percent quarterly drop in 
operating profits to 1379 million from 1552 million in the 
second quarter of 1988 
the writers strike delayed the start of the 198889 television 
season causing an uncommonly high percentage of firstrun regular 
series programming on the network schedule during the second 
quarter tisch said 
he also attributed the lower operating profits in the broadcast 
group to the quick fourgame finish of the national basketball 
association championship compared the sevengame finals in 1988

soybean futures prices closed dramatically lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade following the exchanges 
emergency order requiring traders to reduce holdings in contracts 
for july delivery 
corn and oat futures prices were narrowly mixed while wheat 
futures fell moderately 
the board of trade issued the emergency order late tuesday in a 
move widely perceived as an attempt to crush one companys attempt 
to corner the soybean market exchange officials would not name the 
company 
soybeans for delivery in july closed 40 cents lower at 686 a 
bushel other contracts closed 25 cents lower to 7 cents higher 
analysts noted that overnight rainfall in the western reaches of 
the corn belt also may have prompted some selling of soybeans and 
corn 
certainly the extent of the decline in july was precipitated by 
this ruling but i think the market had reason to drop despite this 
ruling said ted mao a grain specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
trading in other market was cautious ahead of an agriculture 
department report on planted crop acreage the report released 
after the close pegged soybean acreage at 613 million acres and 
corn acreage at 728 million acres 
the soybean number was lower than expected and analysts said it 
could spark buying of newcrop futures on thursday the corn number 
was larger than expected and was pronounced bearish for the corn 
market 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 7 cents lower with july at 
388 a bushel corn was 3 cents lower to 6 cents higher with july 
at 255 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with 
july at 143 a bushel

producer prices retail sales industrial production and capacity 
utilization

dealers say 
after the news comes out the end of the week i would say 
the fed will err on the easier side said ronald h holzer chief 
dealer at harris trust amp co in chicago

less attractive to foreign investors thereby decreasing the need to 
convert their currencies into dollars

eastern airlines plans to submit a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan before july 21 an attorney representing the 
strikebound carrier said wednesday 
attorney deryck palmer told us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland at a hearing that the airline would file the plan prior to 
the july 21 end of its exclusivity period during which competing 
plans may not be filed 
under bankruptcy law a company has 60 days after it files a 
restructuring plan to seek creditor approval of the plan rival 
plans also cant be filed during that period 
last wednesday lifland agreed to a joint request by eastern and 
its major creditors to extend the exclusivity period for two weeks 
through july 21 after they indicated they were nearing agreement on 
a restructuring plan 
a company seeking chapter 11 protection has the sole right to 
submit a reorganization plan to the court during the first 120 days 
of its case after which other parties may propose plans 
easterns reorganization is centered around its plan for 
operating at about twothirds its prestrike size and addresses how 
creditors would be repaid and shareholders treated 
eastern wants to pay creditors with the proceeds of about 18 
billion in asset sales including several that already have been 
approved by the bankruptcy court 
the airline also announced wednesday that its passenger traffic 
in june exceeded expectations apparently attempting to show the 
success of their rebuilding despite the strike the carrier said it 
flew 2522 million revenue passenger miles a measurement of airline 
capacity 
at the hearing lifland postponed until aug 1 consideration of 
the eastern pilots unions request that a trustee be appointed to 
take over operation of the airline 
miamibased eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on march 9 
five days after the start of the strike 
the pilots filed a motion seeking appointment of a trustee soon 
after the strike began but consideration repeatedly has been 
postponed by lifland 
the latest request for a postponement was made by david i 
shapiro the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner because he is 
conducting contract negotiations in washington between the company 
and the three striking unions the talks began several weeks ago 
with eastern and the pilots union and were broadened monday to 
include its machinists and flight attendants 
the parties are engaged in intense negotiation lifland said 
appointing a trustee at this time would be like adding on a fifth 
engine with reverse thrust i dont see any point to that he said 
also wednesday the transport workers union which represents the 
6200 eastern flight attendants announced it has contracted labor 
strategist ray rogers and his firm corporate campaign inc to launch 
a multidimensional offensive against eastern owner frank lorenzo 
the union said the actions against lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp will include an international boycott of 
eastern its sister carrier continental airlines and scandinavian

soybean futures prices tumbled wednesday on the chicago board of 
trade following the exchanges emergency order that traders reduce 
their holdings in contracts for july delivery 
the order was perceived as a move to crush an alleged attempt to 
corner the soybean market 
wheat futures also retreated while corn and oat futures ended 
mixed ahead of an agriculture department crop report that traders 
pronounced bullish for soybeans and bearish for corn 
on other markets coffee futures sank to a new eightyear low 
precious metals prices fell energy futures were mixed and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
in chicago soybeans for delivery in july settled 39 cents lower 
at 686 a bushel in a session marked by fitful trading with the 
heaviest selling near the opening and the close other contracts 
ended 25 cents lower to 7 cents higher 
the board of trade issued an emergency order late tuesday 
requiring all traders to reduce their july soybean positions to 3 
million bushels by the end of trading tuesday and to 1 million 
bushels by thursday the expiration date for the july contract 
exchange officials would not explain the reasons behind the move 
but a number of traders and analysts said it seemed designed to 
prevent a single party from gaining control of the market 
published reports claimed the target of the exchanges order was 
ferruzzi spa a huge italian agricultural and financial firm that is 
one of the worlds biggest soybean processors but ferruzzi stated 
it had not tried to corner the market and protested the board of 
trades order 
analysts noted that overnight rainfall in the western corn belt 
also may have prompted some selling of soybeans and corn 
i think the market had reason to drop despite this ruling 
said ted mao a grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
trading in other grain markets was cautious ahead of an 
agriculture department report on planted crop acreage the report 
pegged soybean acreage at 613 million acres and corn acreage at 
728 million acres 
the soybean number was lower than expected and analysts said it 
could spark buying of newcrop soybean futures on thursday the corn 
number was higher than expected and was pronounced bearish 
wheat settled 3 cents to 7 cents lower with july at 388 a 
bushel corn was 3 cents lower to 5 cents higher with july at 
255 a bushel oats were cent lower to 2 cents higher with july 
at 143 a bushel 
coffee futures skidded on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange amid talk that mexico had sold up to 300000 132pound bags 
of unroasted coffee beans 
some traders perceived the rumored sale as an escalation of a war 
for market share following the collapse of an international 
pricesupport agreement last week 
coffee settled 234 cents to 363 cents lower with july at 8525 
cents a pound 
gold and silver futures prices fell moderately on new yorks 
commodity exchange in trading inspired by technical factors and the 
absence of new supplyanddemand developments the drop in soybean 
and crude oil prices portending lower food and fuel prices may 
also have prompted selling of the inflationsensitive precious 
metals analysts said 
gold settled 280 to 290 lower with august at 38040 a troy 
ounce silver was 69 cents to 81 cents lower with july at 5188 a 
troy ounce

settlements totaling 895 million have been 
reached in greenmail lawsuits by walt disney co shareholders 
against the disney board of directors and wall street financier saul 
steinberg the parties announced wednesday 
suits brought by present and former disney shareholders alleged 
they lost millions when disney ended a steinbergled takeover 
attempt in 1984 by paying a premium price to buy out his disney 
stock 
of the settlements which are subject to court approval and 
mainly will be paid by insurors 295 million will be split among 
thousands of former disney shareholders included in a class action 
suit that claimed the stockholders sold their shares at a loss when 
disney stock plunged after the hostile bid by steinbergs reliance 
group holdings inc was terminated 
burbankbased disney will receive the other 60 million although 
a disney attorney would not detail how that would happen that 
settlement stems from a derivative action brought by current disney 
stockholders 
a statement the parties issued with the settlements and read by 
superior court judge abby soven said disney acted in good faith 
during the takeover effort 
disney attorney michael diamond said the 60 million was a 
recovery on behalf of the company but he denied it was simply a 
matter of money going into disneys pocket 
the company will not end up with cash out of the settlement 
said diamond he did not address other kinds of consideration or 
financing but said the shareholders would be able to direct where 
the company must use the money 
the derivative action was to have been decided by the judge 
while jurors considered the case brought by former shareholders 
reliance which has interests in insurance real estate and 
investing issued a statement in new york saying its share of the 
settlement was 208 million and it would take a pretax charge in 
that amount against its second quarter earnings 
the company stated it believed all its actions in the case were 
lawful but it decided that settlement was more prudent than risking 
the undertainties of a jury trial 
between march and june 1984 steinberg bought up 12 percent of 
disney and announced his intent to take over the company and sell 
off parts of it 
the disney board offered steinberg 325 million for his shares a 
figure well above the market price steinberg accepted the offer and 
made an estimated 60 million on the deal 
disney shares tumbled after news of steinbergs buyout plunged 
the stock almost 10 points thousands of shareholders who gambled on 
a disney buyout and change in management were caught unaware and 
many decided to dump their stock at a loss 
the lawsuit contended the disney board violated a fiduciary trust 
with its stockholders by paying greenmail to steinberg the 
board replied that steinberg was paid to prevent destruction of the 
company 
attorneys for disney and the plaintiffs declined to say how much 
of the 295 million was being contributed by disney reliance or 
their insurers but said shareholder reports and statements 
eventually would disclose the amounts 
money is being paid on behalf of the directors but no money is 
being paid directly by disney diamond said 
diamond said the principals in the matter including disney 
banker morgan stanley were indemnified against such actions 
the settlements ending five years of litigation in the matter 
came after three weeks of trial before judge soven she told jurors 
that attorneys in the matter were drawn to an agreement as the case 
unfolded in court 
the settlement contemplates a finding by the court that the 
directors of the walt disney co in 1984 acted in good faith and in 
what they believed to be in the best interest of the company the 
statement issued with the settlements read 
diamond said disney would not have agreed to the settlement 
without that statement of finding 
in both cases the settlement amounts include attorneys fees and 
expenses

the house ways and means committee on wednesday 
gave tentative approval to a catchall tax bill that would raise 53 
billion for deficit reduction next year 
before endorsing the measure on a voice vote the panel b a 
2211 vote rejected president bushs proposal to reduce the tax on 
capital gains committee aides said a capitalgains reduction is 
likely to be considered again before the committee takes final 
action on the bill 
by voice vote at a closeddoor session the committee eliminated 
from the package a proposed extension of the 3 percent tax on local 
and long distance telephone service the tax is due to expire dec 
31 1990 
earlier in the day the committee voted to repeal a requirement 
that employers use complex tests to prove that their 
healthinsurance plans do not discriminate against lowerpaid 
employees the senate has approved similar changes in the law known 
as section 89 and the bush administration also favors the changes 
the bill would not wipe out antidiscrimination requirements it 
would instead greatly simplify how employers may prove their plans 
are fair 
most of the three dozenplus revenueraising provisions in the 
tax package drafted by rep dan rostenkowski dill the committee 
chairman are technical changes affecting corporations others would 
raise taxes on users of snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco halt a 
scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets and air cargo and 
impose income tax withholding on some farm workers who now are 
exempt 
committee aides said that before the package is completed the 
panel probably will vote on an amendment that would eliminate the 
tobaccotax increase also members are likely to offer dozens of 
amendments of their own including one that would repeal the new tax 
older americans pay for insurance to protect against catastrophic 
medical expenses 
in addition an effort will be made to retain at least some part 
of a tax benefit for employee stockownership plans that 
rostenkowski has proposed to repeal 
the bill tentatively approved by the committee would end the tax 
exclusion that lenders now are allowed for half the interest earned 
on loans used to buy company stock for an esop it also would wipe 
out the employer deduction for dividends paid on stock held by an 
esop 
those two provisions would raise more than 16 billion of the 
53 billion that the committee is required to generate for deficit 
reduction in the budget year that begins oct 1 
other parts of the bill which are not subject to change would 
impose a 3centabarrel tax on domestic crude oil and imported oil 
repeal the completedcontract accounting break for defense 
contractors and require that certain types of deferred income be 
subject to social security taxes 
repeal of the antidiscrimination tests for healthinsurance 
plans is a major goal of business organizations which consider the 
rules overly complicated and costly to administer 
congress enacted the rules in 1986 to expand the number of 
workers covered by health insurance but some employers say the 
rules instead will force them to drop health plans 
members of congress were concerned that highly compensated 
employees should not receive an unduly large share of the 
30billionplus annual federal tax subsidy for employerpaid health 
insurance the law considers any worker who earns more than 54300 
a year to be highly compensated 
the rules were to take effect jan 1 but became such a source of 
controversy that the treasury department delayed their 
implementation until oct 1 
the ways and means committee bill would delay any testing of 
health plans until jan 1 
after that date a health plan would be considered 
nondiscriminatory if made available to 90 percent of all employees 
and the employer paid at least 50 percent of the premium in 
addition the annual premium charged a worker earning under 20000 
a year could not exceed 1000 for a policy covering only the worker 
and 2000 for a family policy 
a higherpaid worker who received a benefit greater than allowed 
under the formula would have to include the excess in taxable income 
the committee legislation includes a special break for small 
business the health plan of a business with fewer than 20 workers 
would be considered nondiscriminatory if the employer provides 
coverage for all employees and contributes the same dollar amount or 
percentage of premium to all 
the house legislation includes separate requirements for 
cafeteria plans under which employees may choose from among 
benefits that include cash and health coverage a plan would be 
acceptable if basic health coverage were available to 90 percent of 
all employees and if the average benefit for higherpaid workers did 
not exceed 150 percent of that given other employees

lawsuit that two canadian companies have made false and misleading 
statements about their financing for a 305 million bid to take over 
the doughnut chain 
in an amended complaint in us district court in boston dunkin 
donuts alleged that the financing arranged by unicorp canada corp 
and cara operations ltd would not meet federal margin regulations 
which limit borrowing to buy stock

substantial conditions

with federal regulators in washington and that the companies are 
satisfied that it complies fully with all applicable laws including 
the us margin regulations 
unicorp a torontobased real estate banking and energy firm 
holds about 12 percent of dunkin donuts common stock it formed a 
partnership with cara a food services company to launch the 
hostile offer on june 15 
kingsbridge capital group a subsidiary of unicorp and cara have 
said they would invest up to 80 million of equity and debt in the 
takeover and have a firm commitment for an additional 275 million 
of financing from trilon financial group and great lakes group inc
