californias first execution in 23 
years may be less than a week away and some surveys suggest that 
80 percent of the states residents think its about time 
but theres a small vocal minority trying to change the hearts 
and minds of those who believe that death is the proper punishment 
for taking a human life 
at 3 am on april 3 unless appeals are successful 37yearold 
robert alton harris will be strapped into san quentins 
7squarefoot applegreen gas chamber and a cloud of cyanide gas 
will end his troubled life 
state attorneys in san diego on tuesday filed their response to 
harris federal appeal saying there is nothing new in the latest 
petition to warrant a stay of execution 
harris attorneys were to reply wednesday and a hearing was 
scheduled for then if us district judge william enright rejects 
their stay request the defense lawyers next move would be to file 
a petition with the 9th us circuit court of appeals a denial at 
the 9th circuit would leave only an appeal to the us supreme 
court which has denied harris appeals four times 
jim young of oakland is conducting a threeweek vigil outside 
the prison 
should we as a society use the same language as the murderer 
the language of death and create new victims society must rise 
above the level of the murderer said young 
on monday young a member of death penalty focus sat by a 
black cardboard coffin and signs reading dont kill for me and 
the death penalty is dead wrong 
two other people including the wife of another deathrow 
inmate stood nearby 
also on hand were a man and a woman who declined to identify 
themselves carrying signs applauding the execution and urging 
people to remember his victims 
on tuesday roman catholic priests from around the state led a 
prayer service outside the main gate against the execution four 
capital punishment foes were arrested for blocking a road 
authorities said 
harris on parole after a manslaughter conviction was sentenced 
to die for the 1978 murders of san diego 16yearolds john mayeski 
and michael baker he abducted them at a burger stand to use their 
car in a bank robbery 
we know were up against a hard rock of public opinion but 
people say theyre for the death penalty because its been sold 
to them said young burned by the sun and slightly weak from the 
early stages of a 10day fast 
thats why were out here at the gate to give out 
information 
members of other groups opposed to capital punishment also have 
been fasting speaking out taking turns in the vigil and writing 
to gov george deukmejian asking for clemency 
in london on tuesday about 30 members of amnesty international 
protested outside the us embassy the human rights organization 
left a letter for the ambassador expressing concern that there will 
be a precedent created for other american states not currently 
carrying out executions 
death penalty foes also fear harris execution could be quickly 
followed by many others in california more than 270 other men are 
on san quentins death row prosecutors discount such a possibility 
because each prisoner gets the same appeals that have helped delay 
harris execution for 11 years 
opponents argue that capital punishment is immoral is not a 
deterrent and is a poor way to convince people that murder is wrong 
yet the san franciscobased field institute which conducts the 
california poll found in mid1986 that 83 percent of californians 
supported capital punishment and 14 percent were opposed 
california law provides for life without possibility of parole 
but some people are skeptical it assures murderers wont be 
released to kill again 
whats to say the people of the state of california wont 
elect another jerry brown into office and end up with a parole 
board to let those people out said steve baker a policeman and 
the father of one of harris young victims 
brown the state democratic party leader is a former governor 
known for his liberal judicial appointments 
michael rushford president of the criminal justice legal 
foundation a national victims rights group based in sacramento 
argued that sentencing murderers to life without parole does not 
assure they will not kill other prisoners or guards 
rushford maintains theres little risk of executing an innocent 
man 
the chances of an innocent person being convicted of a serious 
crime in this country is many many times less than the chance of 
being murdered he said

more than 100 feet of interstate 90 
collapsed and slid into lake coeur dalene on tuesday evening but 
there were no injuries authorities said 
the section of the eastbound lane east of this northern idaho 
resort town sloughed off into the lake near a boat ramp said a 
state police spokeswoman who would only give her name as glenna 
there were no injuries and no cars left the highway she said 
traffic was restricted to the westbound lane 
the accident occurred at a site where contractors hired by the 
state have been filling about 5 acres of the lake with dirt to make 
room along the shore for an i90 interchange being built 
the section fell into the lake because mud on the bottom of the 
lake apparently didnt support the weight of the fill said don 
johnson of the state department of transportation who was called 
to the site

this new countrys black leaders 
avowed socialists during their long exile are now looking to 
businessmen and foreign investors to help develop the nation 
the weekold government says it has learned from the mistakes of 
africas socialistoriented economies which have failed even more 
dramatically than those in eastern europe 
president sam nujoma in a major economic speech one week ago on 
independence day did not make a single reference to socialism and 
promised a dynamic role for the private sector 
we are committed to a mixed economy said nujoma we look 
forward to a good partnership between the state and the private 
sector 
less than a year ago nujoma and other members of his southwest 
africa peoples organization or swapo were returning from exile 
and declaring their belief in the moral superiority of socialism 
over capitalism 
but as independence from south africa neared the rhetoric 
changed 
i think the leaders were quite impressed with the development 
in many parts of the country especially windhoek said rainer 
ritter a private economist they were coming from poor african 
countries and they didnt want namibia to go the same way 
a senior south african official who requested anonymity said 
swapo leaders revised their economic policies after western nations 
said they would not provide aid to a socialistoriented economy 
the soviets and former east bloc nations the main backers of swapo 
during its war against south african rule had no money to give 
all the southern african nations that have relied on state 
control of the economy angola zambia zimbabwe tanzania and 
mozambique have suffered economic declines or fallen far short of 
their potential all now are making at least limited attempts to 
restructure their economies 
the one blackruled capitalist country in the region botswana 
has one of the highest growth rates in the world and often is cited 
by economists as a model for development 
nujoma and his cabinet made up mostly of exguerrilla leaders 
with no experience in managing an economy stress that the skills 
and money of white businessmen and foreign investors are essential 
in building namibia 
nujoma has named two white businessmen otto herrigel and gert 
hanekom as his ministers of finance and agriculture 
on independence day the government announced an agreement with 
the british firm lonrho to build a 150 million sugar refinery that 
could create 4000 jobs in a country where the unemployment rate is 
more than 30 percent 
the huge arid nation boasts profitable mining fishing and 
farming industries and one of the best economic bases in africa 
much of it built with money from south africa which ruled namibia 
for 75 years 
the 23year war between nujomas guerrillas and the south 
africanled security forces claimed more than 20000 lives but was 
restricted to the rugged bush in the north 
the fighting caused only limited damage to roads schools and 
villages 
namibias annual per capita income tops 1000 a figure only a 
handful of africas more than 50 nations have reached 
however the wealth is disproportionately controlled by whites 
who account for just 75000 of the countrys 13 million people 
swapo estimates that whites own about twothirds of private 
property and earn about 10 times as much as blacks on average 
the most pressing economic task for the government will to be 
meet rising black expectations without alienating whites who can 
move to neighboring south africa 
the namibian government is facing a deficit of almost 200 
million on this years budget of about 900 million the foreign 
debt is more than 300 million relatively modest compared to most 
nations on the heavily indebted continent 
so far namibias leading aid donors have been west germany 
which has agreed to give 59 million and britain which will give 
16 million the united states has not yet completed an aid 
package but is expected to announce a plan shortly 
south africa has cut assistance to namibia after steadily 
reducing its aid in recent years but south african president fw 
de klerk said trade talks and other ties will remain strong 
namibia is heavily dependent on south african for imports more 
importantly south africa controls walvis bay the only deepwater 
port along namibias coast 
walvis bay is more than 600 miles from the nearest south african 
territory but the pretoria government claims ownership based on 
britains 1884 decision to annex walvis bay and make it part of 
south africas cape colony 
namibias constitution claims walvis bay as part of the new 
nation south africa which has army naval and air force bases in 
walvis bay said it is willing to enter negotiations on the status 
of the territory which has 26000 residents

the government is examining 328000 in 
political donations by the chairman of a failed florida thrift 
while a top regulator says the institutions failure could rival 
the 25 billion collapse of lincoln savings and loan association 
a fraud squad of federal examiners is investigating the 
legality of contributions from centrust savings bank chairman david 
l paul to state and national politicians said l william seidman 
head of the federal deposit insurance corp and the resolution 
trust corp 
the propriety of meetings between paul and politicians and 
regulators also is being examined seidman said monday any 
evidence of wrongdoing will be given to the justice department he 
said 
seidman in testimony to the house banking committee said the 
failure of miamibased centrust floridas largest sampl will cost 
taxpayers probably in excess of 2 billion 
until now most analysts counted lincoln based in irvine 
calif as the nations worst sampl collapse 
its going to be a horse race and im afraid that whoever the 
winner is its going to set a record seidman said 
centrust which spent millions of dollars on yachts limousines 
fine art goldplated toilets and other luxuries was seized by the 
government feb 2 it made few residential mortgages and 
specialized in junk bond investing many underwritten by drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
in other sampl developments 
the office of thrift supervision reported monday that the 
nations sampls lost 192 billion last year up from 134 billion 
in 1988 and the third straight record sampls lost money in 33 
states earned profits in 15 and broke even in two 
lawyers for lincoln sampl spent the 13th day of hearings trying 
to convince us district judge stanley sporkin in washington that 
regulators april 1989 takeover of lincoln was unwarranted 
testimony focused on a taxsharing agreement that regulators said 
lincoln owner charles h keating jr used to funnel money from the 
sampl to his holding company 
rep chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking republican on the 
banking committee released a list of pauls political contacts 
which included a luncheon with former president carter in june 1988 
paul met twice with sen donald w riegle dmich chairman of 
the senate banking committee in november 1987 and august 1988 the 
second meeting included sen alan cranston dcalif the no 2 
ranking democrat in the senate 
riegle and cranston are among the socalled keating five 
senators who accepted political contributions from keating and are 
accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators on his 
behalf 
pauls desk calendar according to wylie showed that sens bob 
graham dfla timothy wirth dcolo and john kerry dmass 
flew on centrusts corporate jet in 1987 and 1988 all are now 
members of the senate banking committee although kerry was not at 
the time 
the centrust chairman held receptions aboard his 7 million 
yacht maintained at company expense in september 1988 for louisiana 
democratic sens j bennett johnston and john breaux 
atlantabased federal regulators told the house banking 
committee they were not contacted by politicians on behalf of 
centrust although they said paul frequently bragged of his 
connections 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the banking panel 
said examiners in atlanta recommended seizing centrust as early as 
january 1986 but were ignored by superiors in washington 
paul met four times with m danny wall then chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board in september and november 1987 and 
january and june 1988 
paul had been scheduled to testify to the committee but he said 
through an attorney that he had not decided whether to appear 
gonzalez gave paul two weeks to set a date and said he could be 
subpoenaed if the committee approves 
a list of political contributions provided by seidman showed 
that most of pauls gifts were to democrats although republicans 
received some smaller donations 
among contributions of 5000 or greater were 
5000 in 1988 to sen jim sasser dtenn a member of the 
senate banking committee and now also chairman of the senate budget 
committee 
10000 in 1989 to sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the 
senate judiciary committee 
5000 in 1988 to sen frank lautenberg dnj 
12000 from 1987 to 1989 to rep larry smith dfla

us capitol police officials cope with 
terrorist threats tourists and foreign leaders but their toughest 
current challenge may be allegations of racism aired by their own 
black officers 
the accusations have left the police force racially polarized 
black officers have accused top commanders all white of 
discrimination the police brass has denied the allegations and 
white officers have backed their superiors 
blacks brought their grievances to a house hearing last week 
appearing in such large numbers that a police security detail 
normally would have been assigned to crowd control 
this time it wasnt necessary because the orderly spectators 
and key witnesses at the house administration subcommittee 
hearing were the police 
rep mary rose oakar dohio chairwoman of the police 
subcommittee promised after hearing from both sides that reforms 
were coming to ease the tension she urged a constructive 
dialogue between the black officers and chief frank a kerrigan 
the police force that guards the capitol complex has 1238 
officers including 336 blacks 27 percent of the force 
however the top ranks of lieutenant captain inspector deputy 
chief assistant chief and chief include 61 whites and four blacks 
a minority percentage of 62 percent 
house sergeantatarms jack russ a member of the threeman 
capitol police board said that before an objective written test 
was instituted in 1983 the department was a good old boy 
network with car pool promotions 
but thats been changed said russ who serves on the 
governing board with senate sergeantatarms henry giugni and 
architect of the capitol george white 
sgt ronald l richardson executive director of the newly 
organized capitol police chapter of the national black police 
association said cronyism and nepotism still exist in 
promotions assignments and training for advancement 
we do not have a single black in a policy or decisionmaking 
position above the rank of captain he said 
blacks who apply for top positions are told vacancies have been 
filled only to later learn the person selected for the position 
was handpicked richardson said soon it also comes to light 
that the person selected had been chosen prior to the official 
announcement of the job vacancy 
and why richardson demanded to know were several black 
officers fired after being accused of drug use while white 
officers similarly accused were allowed to remain on the force 
chief kerrigan said he was unaware of those cases and has told 
richardson to provide him a list of specific examples of 
discrimination 
i wont stand for any type of discrimination whatsoever if it 
was brought to my attention i would do something about it i asked 
for a third party to investigate if theres any discrimination 
im unaware of it kerrigan said 
russ added there may be racism in this department if there 
is racism where is it come back with a list of your problems we 
never had one complaint until a couple of weeks ago 
a number of white police officers including several women 
wrote the subcommittee to deny any discrimination 
as a female caucasian official on the united states capitol 
police force i do not feel that there is a problem with 
discrimination wrote sgt ruth b micer she recalled using her 
vacation to study for written and oral tests she regarded as fair 
to everyone 
another letter by lts price s goldston and stanley j 
grochowski jr both white added we have no knowledge of racial 
discrimination existing within the united states capitol police 
kerrigan said the best way to make room for blacks at the top is 
to create a new retirement system currently top white officers 
stay at their jobs because they must work 30 years and be age 55 or 
older to qualify for retirement longer than in other local police 
departments 
the chief proposed a system to allow retirement at age 50 after 
20 years of service or after 25 years of service regardless of age

richard nixon says he has resigned himself to 
what history will say about him if it can say it in only a sentence 
he resigned the office 
he would have it otherwise he suggested but he cant budge 
historys version presidents can write their slogans but not 
their epitaphs 
jimmy carter campaigned on ill never lie to you but 
thats not what people remember about him 
gerald ford came closer installed in office unelected he went 
to congress modestly saying im a ford not a lincoln 
history agrees 
the matter of capsulizing presidents in a sentence came up in an 
interview nixon had with time magazine to coincide with the 
publication of his latest book 
clare boothe luce writer diplomat wife of time magazines 
founder once said that each person in history can be summed up in 
one sentence said nixon this was after i had gone to china 
she said you will be summed up he went to china 
added nixon historians are more likely to lead with he 
resigned the office 
the jury has already come in and theres nothing thats going 
to change it theres no appeal historians will judge it harshly 
what would history say in a sentence about other presidents 
lyndon johnson nixons predecessor a complicated president 
takes two thoughts something like he declared war on poverty 
but got bogged down in vietnam 
ford nixons successor served two years and achieved little of 
lasting effect but his first words as president were our long 
national nightmare is over and he in fact healed watergates 
wounds until he reopened watergates divisions 
sum him up he ended a nightmare then pardoned nixon 
ford was succeeded by jimmy carter who is remembered for a 
single word he did not utter malaise carter made a midway 
speech about the nations vague sense of unease its theme 
characterized his tenure 
he provided plenty of images the unimperial president walking 
down pennsylvania avenue wearing a sweater on television 
persuading the stubborn leaders of israel and egypt to make peace 
a detail man who worried about who would use the white house tennis 
court 
sum it up his micromanaged presidency didnt work 
at the time ronald reagan occupied the oval office washington 
talked of the reagan revolution but in a years retrospection 
it was a revolution that didnt seem to have changed so much 
reagan was disengaged but persuasive a handsoff president his 
contribution seems more one of spirit than substance 
how about he gave america confidence and deficits 
harry truman felt like the earth the moon and the stars had 
descended on him when franklin roosevelt unexpectedly died and left 
the presidency to him he is most memorable for his gutsy 1948 
election campaign winning when all thought he would lose 
for truman the little man who beat the odds to keep the 
office 
fdr was the only president elected four times and was despised 
by his enemies for that and a lot of other reasons they would have 
chosen epithet for epitaph a traitor to his class 
but historys already in he led america out of the depression 
and the allies to victory 
dwight eisenhower succeeded truman a grandfatherly figure of 
enormous popularity but a bare record they liked ike 
john f kennedy was young elegant and eloquent but his 
presidency is summed up in one sad fact he was shot to death in 
dallas 
there were a lot of other presidents 41 so far except for two 
so famous they need no names first or last father of his 
country and freed the slaves and saved the union history 
would have trouble summarizing most of the rest in a sentence 
its hard enough remembering their names

after six decades as an actress and with 
everything from a tony to an emmy to an obie under her arm 
80yearold jessica tandy could have picked up the actress oscar 
and said it was about time 
instead she wondered aloud why the producers of driving miss 
daisy chose someone whose forte is the stage to play a lead in a 
movie 
i think im very lucky they trusted me with such a wonderful 
part miss tandy told reporters backstage at the los angeles 
music center monday night 
they could have picked someone with more experience she 
said drawing incredulous laughter from the press corps i never 
thought of myself as a movie actress 
and the many honors she has earned over the years didnt blunt 
the thrill of winning hollywoods coveted golden statuette 
it means tiptop its very very important she said im 
walking on air at the moment 
informed that she was the oldest winner of an academy award 
miss tandy replied am i the oldest well good for me but not 
by much in 1976 george burns won for his supporting performance 
in the sunshine boys he was 80 and three months at the time 
miss tandy is 80 and nine months 
she has won many acting honors tony awards for her stage role 
as blanche dubois in a streetcar named desire and her parts in 
the gin game and foxfire an obie for her part samuel 
becketts not i and an emmy for the hallmark hall of fame tv 
production of foxfire 
the actress had fierce competition in the category isabelle 
adjani for camille claudel pauline collins for shirley

for the fabulous baker boys

labor leaders call walkouts at 37 nuclear 
power plants a success as workers made a bid for union 
representation but companies involved say insignificant numbers of 
workers stayed off the job 
about 3000 radiation technicians at nuclear reactors across the 
nation closed for refueling were encouraged to walk off the job 
monday in a nationwide effort to have the international brotherhood 
of electrical workers become their bargaining agent 
all i can tell you is its working said ibew official av 
griffies who said it was impossible to say how many of the 3000 
technicians involved refused to go to work monday 
but several utility contractors said the walkouts had little 
impact at the reactors where they provide workers to monitor 
radiation levels 
it has been business as usual said karen armour a 
spokeswoman at asca brown boveri inc of stamford conn the 
parent of power systems energy services inc 
the company has more than 600 technicians working at nine sites 
very few workers failed to show she said 
frank ingram a spokesman for the nuclear regulatory commission 
said the agency had been monitoring the situation and had not 
received any reports that work at the closed reactors had stopped 
griffies said striking workers set up only one picket line at 
the turkey point nuclear plant south of miami where about 100 
workers stayed off the job 
another 100 contract workers at florida power corps crystal 
river nuclear plant refused to work 
griffies declined to elaborate on why only one picket line was 
established or to say how long the walkout would last 
the ibew which already represents the majority of permanent 
nuclear power plant workers targeted eight utility contractors who 
provide traveling health physics technicians to reactors that 
close down for refueling or maintenance 
those technicians make between 11 and 14 an hour and have not 
received pay increases in eight years griffies said 
james p schmitt spokesman for westinghouse electric corp in 
pittsburgh said the strike is not having an impact with the 
westinghouse workers in the industry 
the call for the job action has had little or no impact 
schmitt said 
between 300 to 500 westinghouse technicians are involved he 
said the company has a pool of 1000 workers he said 
schmitt said substantial majority of technicians were on the 
job but weve had a couple here and there that have called in 
sick the numbers are insignificant so its conceivable that their 
illnesses are legitimate 
baltimore gas and electric co spokesman art sluzark said the 
strike had not affected the companys calvert cliffs nuclear power 
plant 
all 98 of the technicians who work for bartlett nuclear of 
plymouth mass reported for work monday he said

in as little as two years the world could be 
using oil as fast as it can be pumped out of the ground says 
former energy secretary james r schlesinger 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has been 
producing at more than 90 percent of capacity while soviet 
production has dropped schlesinger told the senate energy 
committee on monday and he said that iran and iraq despite ending 
their war are marketing considerably less oil than had been 
anticipated 
with the call on opec growing at over a million barrels per 
day each year we are only a couple of years away from the point 
that demand would theoretically reach the level of present 
capacity schlesinger said 
john j easton jr an assistant energy secretary gave the 
committee a more optimistic report although he and schlesinger 
agreed that us oil production will continue to decline if present 
consumption and exploration trends continue 
in the long run easton said through concerted efforts to 
find and produce more of our domestic resources we may be able to 
slow the rate of decline in us production but it is unlikely 
under current conditions that we will be able to reverse the 
trend 
schlesinger who also has served as director of the cia and as 
secretary of defense said us national security and economic 
interests are threatened by the growing demand for foreign oil 
there is a strong possibility of a 30 percent or 40 percent 
increase in prices he said that we will have a price surge in 
the decade seems to me to be beyond question 
us demand for oil will grow by about 2 percent a year until 
there are steep price increases schlesinger said in a recent 
month he added the united states had to rely on foreign sources 
to meet a record 54 percent of its oil demand 
schlesinger said that by 1995 us imports should reach as much 
as 11 million barrels a day compared with a net average of just 
over 7 million barrels a day in 1989 
the oil import bill then will likely exceed our present trade 
deficit he said that would be in range of over 100 billion a 
year 
that statement if correct is of profoundest concern to the 
us economy said sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the 
energy committee 
while domestic demand for oil has been growing schlesinger 
said us production continues to fall drilling activity is low 
by historical standards and the giant prudhoe bay field in alaska 
is in declining production he said 
we may as well acknowledge that over the past decade the 
united states as a practical matter abandoned the quest for energy 
independence indeed even the quest for low energy dependency 
schlesinger said if we are to limit our future vulnerability 
either for national security or international financial reasons we 
shall have to reverse course and take vigorous action 
schlesingers formula for reducing imports includes increased 
conservation more tax incentives for domestic producers and 
expanded drilling 
relying on renewable energy sources such as solar energy 
will not solve the problem because those sources do little for 
transportation which is responsible for the growth in demand for 
oil he said 
despite relaxed eastwest tensions and the end of the iraniraq 
war schlesinger said the strategic petroleum reserve should be 
increased from the present 750millionbarrel supply to 1 billion

kingpins from new englands most powerful 
organized crime family were taken into custody in a threestate fbi 
sweep that authorities said proved both the existence and 
vulnerability of la cosa nostra 
the case represents a stake in the heart of an organized crime 
family from the boss on down us attorney dick thornburgh said 
after all but six of 21 alleged organized crime figures were under 
arrest monday 
the 113count indictments were especially significant for their 
extensive description of a solemn blood initiation rite said 
thornburgh who was joined in boston by fbi director william 
sessions and us attorneys for massachusetts rhode island and 
connecticut 
it should lay to rest once and for all any doubts that the 
cosa nostra is a figment of law enforcements imagination 
fbi agents fanned out monday over the three states to arrest the 
alleged criminals on a range of charges including murder 
racketeering kidnapping drug trafficking gambling obstruction 
of justice and witness intimidation reputed boss raymond 
junior patriarca son of the regions late reputed mob leader 
was arrested at 630 am monday at his home in lincoln ri 
patriarca 45 was transferred to boston after a brief 
appearance before a us magistrate in providence ri in 
massachusetts a magistrate ordered the alleged crime boss and 
codefendant carmen a tortora held pending a hearing april 6 
the 20 others named in the indictments were allegedly members of 
the patriarca organized crime family whose induction ceremony was 
detailed in the indictments secretly handed up last week and 
unsealed monday 
according to the indictments patriarca and 17 other alleged 
family members attended a ceremony in which four alleged mob 
candidates received instructions concerning the rules of la cosa 
nostra agreed to kill any individual who posed a threat to the 
organization and its members 
the indictment said the four took the following oath in italian 
before drawing blood from their index fingers i want to 
enter into this organization to protect my family and to protect 
all my friends i swear not to divulge this secret and to obey 
with love and omerta 
omerta refers to the code of silence 
a holy card with the image of the saint of the patriarca family 
was then burned as the following was repeated as burns this 
saint so will burn my soul i enter alive into this organization 
and leave it dead according to the indictments authorities did 
not identify the saint 
sessions said the tapes of the induction ceremony in medford in 
october showed the bureaus ability to invade the inner sanctums 
with the intention to destroy them 
other alleged mobsters were in custody pending court appearances 
or held on previous charges that were superseded by the new 
indictments lawyers said four suspects were expected to surrender 
today while two others remained at large monday night 
if convicted on all counts each of the defendants faces from 40 
years in prison and a fine of 500000 to 85 years in jail and a 
fine of 25 million 
this has always been one of the major organized crime 
families said dennis ocallaghan special agent in charge of the 
investigation and weve basically got the entire hierarchy 
raymond patriarca sr who died in 1984 was identified as head 
of the new england la cosa nostra during 1969 us senate committee 
hearings 
he was arrested more than 40 times and convicted of 18 crimes 
ranging from playing dice on a sunday to armed robbery and 
conspiracy to murder he served seven years in prison 
law enforcement officials generally believe that patriarcas son 
inherited control of the new england mob on his fathers death

japanese director akira kurosawa who at age 
80 received an honorary oscar for 47 years of film making got a 
chuckle from the audience monday night when he said he still had 
much to learn 
but kurosawa the director of such films as ran 
rashomon and seven samurai was serious he said he feared 
he did not deserve the academy award because he did not fully 
understand his art 
cinema is a marvelous thing but to grasp its true essence is 
very very difficult kurosawa said through an interpreter 
but what i promise you is that from now on i will work as hard 
as i can at making movies and maybe by following this path i will 
achieve the true understanding the true essence of cinema and earn 
this award 
kurosawa was introduced by directors steven spielberg and george 
lucas with spielberg praising him as a man who many of us 
believe is our greatest living film maker and all of us know is one 
of the few true visionaries ever to work in our medium 
backstage lucas said that kurosawa has a brilliant sense of 
the cinema 
hes a directors director said lucas who was inspired by 
kurosawa in making the star wars films 
the audience gave kurosawa a standing ovation as he took the 
stage at the los angeles music center 
the director then watched a filmed greeting from tokyo where he 
was presented with a cake for his 80th birthday on monday the 
audience in los angeles joined in singing happy birthday 
kurosawa credited with helping the world appreciate japanese 
film making directed three films nominated for academy awards his 
1975 film dersu uzala submitted by russia won as best foreign 
language film 
along with lucas other directors have been inspired by kurosawa 
seven samurai was remade in the united states as the 
magnificent seven and rashomon became the outrage the 
spaghetti western a fistful of dollars was a remake of 
yojimbo

the tragedy was foretold its prevention 
attempted but law enforcement failed customers of the happy land 
social club as experts say it is failing to protect the patrons of 
other illegal nightspots 
these places are fire traps theyre in violation of every 
code imaginable state sen jeremy weinstein who led an 
investigation of social clubs in 1981 said monday its true for 
every city in the country 
but it is in new york that the nightmare was realized 
eightyseven lives snuffed out in a rush of flame and toxic smoke 
early sunday the happy lands habitues mainly poor immigrants 
were trapped and felled in moments 
it should not have happened a year and a half ago when seven 
died in a similar fire the mayor formed a task force to close down 
unlicensed clubs soon after the city ordered happy land closed 
for fire safety violations 
it apparently did close for a time and then opened again 
unnoticed by officialdom these places reopen as fast as they 
shut em down said charles ryan an exfire captain and now fire 
science department chairman at john jay college of criminal justice 
as a result despite a renewed crackdown announced monday he 
said it wouldnt shock me if this happened again 
the simple problem is inadequate law enforcement ryan and 
others said but they also called it more complex than that a 
combination of the citys enormous problems shrinking budget and 
paralyzing bureaucracy 
and there is another equally daunting factor tremendous demand 
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs particularly in poor 
immigrant communities where life is difficult diversions are 
scarce and danger is commonplace 
people who are living in tough conditions of life are going to 
look for opportunities to blow off some steam said professor 
william kornblum director of the social research center at the 
city university of new yorks graduate school theyre going to 
pay less attention to the dangers around them 
the hazards can be legion at the happy land authorities say 
there was no open fire exit no firstfloor sprinkler system no 
proper emergency lights and bars on the sole window the only way 
out was through the front door and it was blocked by flames 
allegedly ignited by an arsonist 
the deaths are all the more tragic for the citys failed effort 
to shut the happy land down this should never have happened 
said mayor david dinkins that club had been inspected it had 
been cited and it had been ordered closed 
he immediately launched another crackdown with police posting 
vacate orders on 187 social clubs sunday night 
but vacate orders alone cannot solve the problem issuing a 
piece of paper and saying youre closed doesnt mean anything 
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head said ryan 
identification of illegal clubs has been adequate he said with 
2031 inspections last year by the task force formed in 1988 by 
thenmayor edward i koch its the followup thats weak ryan 
said thats the nut of the problem inadequate enforcement 
better enforcement would require more manpower the police 
estimate there are 1220 social clubs in the city with about 1000 
listed as inactive but happy land was one of those inactive 
clubs and kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600 
operating social clubs some legal many not 
it is true that complete enforcement is futile the clubs are 
always moving to new locations always trying to stay a step or two 
ahead of the authorities kornblum said but he said aggressive 
followup could save lives if the city provided the resources 
there are other approaches as well with a view of social clubs 
as cultural centers kornblum suggested lowinterest city loans for 
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives 
ryan for his part suggested cracking down on the liquor 
merchants who keep the clubs supplied and possibly placing a legal 
limit on retail liquor sales weinstein said he would investigate 
the idea 
yet weinstein a brooklyn democrat noted that little of this is 
new in 1981 his panels report on illegal social clubs included 
this warning the potential fire hazard alone is of such 
proportion that numerous lives could be lost at any time no matter 
how minor the fire was at the outset 
how ironic that after so many years were still back where we 
started he said now a lot of people are going to be up in 
arms over this and then eventually its going to fade until it 
happens again

gov mario cuomos former drug treatment 
commissioner started his new career monday outside the state 
capitol with the same relish along with some mustard that took 
him to the upper reaches of government

dog vendor said julio martinez as he stirred onions and 
sauerkraut in his new chrome steam cart featuring the message 
hes back knishner martinez

services until he resigned in december amid allegations he had 
steered state contracts to friends but on monday he manned the 
only food cart on state street on a cold snowy day typical of 
early spring in albany 
im doing this because julio martinez has bills to pay he 
said this is an honest and a decent way to make a living 
martinez first customer was his successor in state government 
arthur webb new yorks new director of substance abuse services 
i have a friend who is selling hot dogs im just buying a hot

sauerkraut in about two minutes ill have indigestion 
martinez assisted by his wife judy had plenty of customers

protest his treatment by the administration 
the governor was good to me hes one of my heroes said 
martinez 
martinez who made 87300 a year in his state job said hed 
continue to deliver the antidrug message along with frankfurters

former heroin addict who wore a knockout drugs tshirt under

own drug program out here 
the sidewalk space allotted for martinez city vending permit 
used to be directly across the street from the state capitol and 
was visible from cuomos secondfloor office window but this year 
the vendors spaces were moved a few hundred feet up the street at 
the request of state officials city officials said 
martinez return to the state capitol has received much 
attention in the news media but cuomo apparently hadnt noticed

the state department is calling on the united 
nations to increase a proposed observer force for nicaragua to keep 
tensions at a minimum when presidentelect violeta chamorro takes 
office next month 
under a plan agreed to last year by the five central american 
presidents about 200 un observers were to monitor the 
nicaraguanhonduran border 
but under an agreement reached on friday the observers would be 
assigned to protect the security of enclaves in nicaragua where 
contra rebel leaders said they will deploy their forces next month 
the agreement also calls for an internationally supervised 
ceasefire in nicaragua and for the disarming by april 20 of 
contras based in honduras near the nicaraguan border 
the administration has been worried that progress toward 
national reconciliation in nicaragua highlighted by last months 
elections could be set back if warfare resumes between the 
sandinistas and the contras mistrust between the two sides remains 
high 
on monday state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called 
the agreement historic and congratulated the parties on it they 
included the rebel leadership officials of the nicaraguan roman 
catholic church and aides to mrs chamorro she will take office 
april 25 
the agreement is to be guaranteed by the un observer force for 
central america onuca and a separate commission comprised of un 
and organization of american states officials 
the un force would be comprised of military personnel from 
spain west germany and canada the bush administration has asked 
congress for 30 million to finance the peaceful reintegration of 
the contras into nicaraguan society 
we would encourage the parties to move forward as rapidly as 
possible ms tutwiler said towards that end we urge the 
united nations to deploy an enlarged onuca force to nicaragua as 
rapidly as possible 
left unclear from the agreement was the time frame for 
demobilizing the contras who are in nicaragua published reports 
said monday that the rebels intend to remain in the enclaves for 
months after mrs chamorros inauguration 
us officials estimate the number of contras inside nicaragua 
at about 5500 president daniel ortega has said the total is 4000 
to 6000 and has warned that the contras plan a big offensive 
shortly before mrs chamorros inauguration 
the contras have said they are reluctant to disarm unless the 
sandinista security forces do the same they are worried that mrs 
chamorro might not be able to control these forces once she takes 
office 
ms tutwiler said the full cooperation of the sandinistas is 
required for fulfillment of the accord including the assurance 
of secure conditions for the nicaraguan resistance 
this is consistent with the longstanding us view that the 
contras should be required to demobilize only after democratic 
and safe conditions prevail in nicaragua

the americans plan to do a favor for the 
libyans by bombarding their country with billions of green flies 
over the next few years to help wipe out a plague that threatens 
livestock and humans 
researchers hope to wipe out the screwworm by releasing 
sterilized male mexican screwworm flies who will mate with females 
and prevent them from laying eggs that will hatch 
the screwworm normally is transmitted from animal to animal but 
in cultures where people live close to their livestock the flies 
lay eggs in peoples noses and the worms eat their hosts brains 
the us agency for international development is sponsoring the 
project and the actual aerial release of the sterile flies will be 
from planes flown under international auspices 
the flies found their way to libya in mid1988 apparently 
through a shipment from south america previously the atlantic and 
pacific oceans had protected the rest of the world 
now there is no large body of water to prevent them from 
spreading to other continents 
a research laboratory of the us department of agriculture in 
north dakota determined that the mexican and libyan species are 
compatible president bush recently signed a law that permits the 
sterile mexican flies to be used outside the western hemisphere 
andrew natsios director of aids office of foreign disaster 
assistance told reporters on monday that the flies are especially 
dangerous in countries where people live close to their farm 
animals 
in many developing countries the animals sleep in close 
proximity to people and what happens at night when people are 
sleeping is that the flies get into the nasal cavity of people and 
lay their eggs and the eggs hatch he said 
people dont know its there until its well along in the 
process they have to have surgery to have the worms removed what 
happens is that if its left untended the screwworm eats through 
the nose into the brain and the person dies 
the scientific name for the fly is cochliomyia hominivorax the 
maneating spiral midge 
the screwshaped larvae burrow deep into flesh bone and 
tissues official reports from libya say 30 people have been 
infected unofficial estimates go as high as 300 
wildlife is also affected including endangered species 
according to aid 
the united nations food and agriculture organization says 70 
million head of cattle are in danger in north africa alone and the 
cost there could reach 250 million a year the organization will 
run the program 
my office tries to prevent disasters before they happen 
natsios said i do not look forward to running famine programs in 
countries which have been attacked by the screwworm fly 
he called the screwworm more dangerous than the locust because 
the threat is constant locusts come in cycles and the threat 
periodically dies away 
natsios said the program will cost about 80 million some of 
which will be contributed by other countries it could put an end 
to the threat before it gets out of libya but if it spread much 
further all of africa the middle east parts of asia and southern 
europe could suffer aid said

an agriculture department trade report says 
the united states may gain some of the foreign vegetable oil market 
for rapeseed and canola but probably will take a back seat to 
canada as a major supplier 
more and more us farmers are interested in getting on the 
rapeseed bandwagon the report said now even nontraditional 
growing areas are getting excited about the prospect of growing 
rapeseed 
although the report uses the term rapeseed generically to 
include canola it does explain the distinction between the two 
crops modified versions of rapeseed developed in canada are 
recognized as canola 
the report in the april issue of agexporter magazine said 
there are no official usda figures on rapeseed production although 
industry estimates are in the range of 65000 to 100000 acres of 
socalled doubleo or canolatype seed and 10000 to 20000 acres 
of industrialgrade rapeseed 
plant geneticist dick auld of the university of idaho who 
pioneered much of the current research in rapeseed varieties for 
us cultivation said most of the increase is expected to occur in 
the southeast 
winter rapeseed is attractive as a rotation crop for winter 
grain and as an erosion control on idle land auld said thus 
commercial expansion of rapeseed in the southeast will hinge on the 
development of winter varieties that can be doublecropped 
dependably with soybeans 
the high plains and pacific northwest will see smaller increases 
in rapeseed production some loweryielding wheat in the plains 
probably will give way to rapeseed and in the northwest the crop 
could be rotated every fourth year with wheat 
field trials of early maturing hybrid winter rapeseed in the 
midwest have had mixed success and auld in the report predicted 
widespread commercial use of highyielding winter hybrids is not 
likely before 1995 
the report was written by margaret e thursland and jeanne f 
bailey of the usda agencys oilseeds and products division 
rapeseed is an ancient crop a member of the brassica family 
which includes mustard turnips and cabbage it is wellknown 
throughout asia middle east and europe as a vegetable oil and for 
industrial purposes 
canada is the leading exporter of rapeseed and japan is the no 
1 singlecountry importer canadas rapeseed exports to japan 
average about 15 million metric tons annually in 1989 us 
exports to japan were less than 2000 tons 
while the united states certainly cannot compete in volume 
with canadian producers there could be a niche as a residual 
supplier of rapeseed to japan and mexico the two largest importers 
of rapeseed outside of the european community the report said 
another factor in the future of us production is the easing of 
federal commodity programs to allow the substitution of certain 
crops including rapeseed and canola without losing crop acreage 
base

an agriculture department survey shows that 
wind damage to land in the great plains has increased sharply 
mainly because of lingering drought in north dakota 
manly wilder associate chief of the departments soil

consumer and business interest rates are 
unlikely to go lower in coming weeks despite political pressure on 
the federal reserve to abandon its tightmoney policy private 
economists say 
these analysts are forecasting that the prime lending rate 
offered by banks will stay at 10 percent where it has been since 
early january 
the prime rate is used by many banks as the benchmark in setting 
about half of their business and consumer loans including 
adjustablerate home equity loans 
mortgage rates which are currently averaging 1026 percent 
nationally for fixedrate loans will remain close to that level at 
least until fall when they might start falling slightly analysts 
say 
this forecast is based on an assumption that federal reserve 
officials who were in washington today to set monetary strategy 
will decide that inflationary risks make it unwise to reduce 
interest rates further 
the economy is growing although weakly while at the same 
time inflation is unacceptably high we have a tug of war between 
those two factors and that will produce no change by the central 
bank allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said monday 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said that while there were 
indications that economic growth is rebounding and inflationary 
pressures are moderating it is too soon for the fed to know for 
sure that these favorable developments are occurring 
the fed is going to have to wait for at least a couple of 
months to get a true reading on where the economy is right now 
jones said for that reason i see no change coming out of this 
meeting 
federal reserve policymakers including board members in 
washington and presidents of fed regional banks meet eight times a 
year behind closed doors to review the economy and revise their 
interest rate targets 
private economists said they believed the central bank would 
stand firm against bush administration pressure to move quickly to 
reduce interest rates as a way of boosting economic growth 
the fed last eased credit conditions just before christmas and 
has resisted repeated urgings by the administration to make further 
changes 
a published report earlier this month quoted an unnamed 
presidential adviser as saying president bush was mad as hell 
and would not reappoint alan greenspan as chairman of the federal 
reserve board next year because of greenspans refusal to heed 
pleas for a looser credit policy 
as the year began many analysts were looking for quick action 
by the fed to lower interest rates in an effort to keep the country 
out of a recession given the fact that the economy in the final 
three months of 1989 had turned in its poorest performance in three 
years 
however business activity picked up early this year leading 
greenspan to say that he believed the danger point for a recession 
had passed 
also working against a looser credit policy is the fact that 
inflationary pressures increased significantly in recent months 
driven upward by cropkilling freezes and a spurt in energy costs 
in addition to domestic concerns over inflation and growth the 
fed is keeping an eye on international markets where the dollar 
has been climbing especially against the japanese yen 
the dollars strength so far this year concerns the 
administration and is one reason the white house has been 
pressuring the fed to lower interest rates 
lower us interest rates serve to push down the dollars value 
because they mean lower profits for foreign investors a lower 
dollar improves americas trade fortunes because it makes us 
goods more competitive on overseas markets and raises the cost of 
imports to american consumers 
david wyss chief economist of drimcgraw hill said that while 
he was not looking for any immediate action by the fed a small 
move toward lowering interest rates could occur later this spring 
if the central bank remains concerned about the dollars strength

driving miss daisy director bruce 
beresford was the forgotten man when they handed out the oscar 
nominations but he got his share of accolades from others honored 
for their work on the film 
academy award ceremony host billy crystal was the first to 
lament the absence of an oscar nomination for beresford whose film 
was the most honored of the night with four statuettes 
in his opening comedy routine crystal called miss daisy as 
the movie that apparently directed itself 
crystals comments were met with steady applause 
when miss daisy won its first award for makeup winner lynn 
barber said in her acceptance speech id also like to 
acknowledge bruce beresford again the audience applauded 
jessica tandy who won for best actress for miss daisy 
called beresford that forgotten man my director 
similar sentiments were expressed by alfred uhry when he picked 
up the screenplay statuette for adapting his own 
pulitzerprizewinng play and by richard zanuck accepting the 
bestpicture award for miss daisy 
in a similar gesture presenter kim basinger made no secret of 
her disdain for the academys snub of spike lees do the right 
thing a muchadmired story of racial prejudice 
we have five great films here miss basinger said as she 
introduced the first of the films nominated for best picture and 
they are great for one reason they tell the truth 
but there is one film missing from this list that deserves to 
be honored because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of 
all and thats do the right thing 
as her remarks were met with applause miss basinger thrust both 
clenched fists into the air shouting yes 
director spike lees do the right thing landed on 81 film 
critics top 10 lists but received just two nominations for 
original screenplay and supporting actor for danny aiello 
anton furst won an academy award for his art direction of 
batman the film is the third most popular in boxoffice 
history but received just one nomination 
jack nicholson who costarred as the joker in the film was 
overlooked in the best supporting actor competition 
for me to be here in front of jack nicholson and we were 
the ones who got it furst said backstage i must say it was

soviet soldiers on tuesday began 
rounding up lithuanians who fled the red army raiding hospitals 
where the men sought refuge after the republics declaration of 
independence from moscow 
witnesses said some of the young men were beaten as they were 
taken from a decaying psychiatric hospital in vilnius a trail of 
blood led down the steps and out the front door of the hospital 
it was the first reported violence in the confrontation between 
lithuania and the kremlin that began march 11 with the baltic 
republics attempt to withdraw from the union 
soviet troops also took over the communist party headquarters a 
showcase office building in the center of the lithuanian capital 
it was the fifth party building soviet forces had seized in recent 
days 
before dawn paratroopers took about two dozen men into custody 
at a psychiatric hospital in vilnius sharply escalating tensions 
that officials said monday seemed to be easing with the opening of 
talks between soviet military and republic officials 
a police officer in kaunas about 65 miles to the west said by 
telephone that soviet troops had taken control of the red cross 
hospital there which had served as a second sanctuary for 
deserters 
the police officer who did not identify himself said the 
soldiers were not allowing lithuanian police to enter the grounds 
of the hospital it was not immediately known if anyone was taken 
into custody there 
a lithuanian interior ministry official said a third hospital 
in a small town outside also was raided and that two or three 
former soldiers were taken away peacefully 
soviet military authorities had warned they would seize the men 
they considered deserters if the men did not return voluntarily by 
last saturday the lithuanian government contends the red army is 
an army of occupation 
lithuania was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
along with the other two baltic republics of latvia and estonia 
independence movements have also sprung up in latvia estonia 
and other soviet republics posing one of the biggest challenges to 
president mikhail s gorbachev since he came to power in 1985 
the actions came after gorbachev told sen edward kennedy on 
monday that he would not use force in lithuania except to save 
lives 
in vilnius a nurse said about a dozen of the men who had been 
staying at the hospital escaped and that others were beaten by 
their captors 
they beat them with their fists a duty nurse said of the 
soviet soldiers who broke into the hospital about 3 am she 
refused to give her name i was afraid they would shoot me too 
the interior ministry official who did not give his name and a 
lithuanian journalist said two lithuanian policemen also were 
beaten by the soldiers when they sought to intervene to stop the 
violence 
a television crew from the american abc news network arrived at 
the scene while the troops were still there was held at gunpoint 
and forced to surrender its video tape 
they held us at gunpoint and told us not to move said 
andrzej lewandowski a member of the camera crew his colleague 
chris burzynski said the soldiers made them take all their 
equipment out of their car and seized all their video cassettes 
lithuanias president vytautas landsbergis suggested saturday 
that the deserters seek sanctuary in churches instead of the 
hospitals but few if any youths appeared to accept the proposal 
some lithuanian leaders said monday that talks that began the 
previous day with soviet military commanders had eased tensions in 
the breakaway republic but others were not so optimistic 
lithuanian deputy premier romualdas ozolas one of two officials 
who met two soviet military officers monday told reporters 
after coming out of this meeting i can say the mood has 
changed 
it is evident the conflict will not be escalated he said 
but president landsbergis was more skeptical he said he had not 
received clear assurances that no more buildings would be occupied 
moreover in a separate interview with the us national public 
radio landsbergis said the situation had become very dangerous 
in the light of gorbachevs remarks to kennedy 
before he always said that he would not use force in 
lithuania but now we have a situation where hes qualifying that 
statement and setting a condition under which he could use force 
soviet television said monday that soviet helicopters have been 
patrolling lithuanias borders daily because of reports 
territorial guard forces set up by the popular independence 
movement sajudis have been erecting border signs 
paratroopers appeared in vilnius on sunday at the higher party 
school and the institute of marxismleninism lithuanian officials 
said there also were soldiers at the vilnius communist party 
headquarters 
ozolas said that during the talks the army said it occupied the 
buildings at the request of lithuanian communists who remain loyal 
to moscow the majority of the party split with moscow in december 
reports in vilnius on monday night said paratroopers had 
occupied another building the communist party committees 
headquarters in the port of klaipeda 200 miles northwest of 
vilnius 
lithuanian journalist and activist vilus kavalauskas told 
reporters the paratroopers had arrived in response to a request by 
klaipedas assistant party chief kavalauskas did not say when the 
building was seized 
a helicopter dropped leaflets on vilnius urging people to attend 
an antiindependence rally tuesday outside parliament one set of 
leaflets was unsigned while another was signed by ussr citizens 
in lithuania the republic of 38 million has a large russian 
minority 
they are pushing the lithuanian people into an abyss of 
independence the leaflets warned think will we be free in 
this free state where the right to own property is given again 
into alien hands 
kennedy said gorbachev told him he was committed to solving the 
dispute with lithuania peacefully and only would use troops if 
lives were in danger 
speaking to a news conference after the meeting kennedy said 
the soviet leader indicated to me that the position of the soviet 
union was that there would be no use of force unless the lives of 
others were threatened and that he was committed to a peaceful 
resolution 
gorbachev did not say whether he thought any threat to human 
life was imminent in lithuania the massachusetts democrat reported 
at mondays talks in vilnius ozolas and lithuanian interior 
minister marijonas misiukonis met with col viktor smokarev deputy 
chief of the vilnius military garrison and col vladimir trikoz of 
the interior ministry 
they agreed not to take any steps affecting security without 
first informing the other side ozolas told reporters 
last week gorbachev ordered lithuanians to turn in all firearms 
and on thursday he told them to stop signing up for volunteer 
military units and threatened to round up soviet army deserters

monday nights show marked the first time the oscars have gone 
truly international besides the announcements at the music center 
envelopes were sent to entertainers for unsealing in four other 
cities 
art direction by glenn close and mel gibson in london foreign 
language film by jack lemmon and russian actress netalya negoda in 
moscow sound and sound effects editing by bryan brown and rachel 
ward in sydney documentaries and shorts by charlton heston and 
norma aleandro in buenos aires 
i looked at every awards show since 1955 and one thing stands 
out how much the oscars reflect the times said the shows 
producer gilbert cates if you wanted to know the history of 
1955 you could get a good impression from the show including what 
people wore what their entertainment was what was on their minds 
when you consider all the changes that happened last year in 
europe and other parts of the world it made sense to have a show 
that reflected those changes 
a win for best picture brings not only glory to the filmmakers 
but millions in revenue for the releasing company last years 
triumph rain man provides an example reports barry lorie 
mgmua marketing chief 
on the week before the oscars rain man was playing in 1542 
theaters and grossed 3003521 on the week following the oscars 
rain man played in 1581 theaters and grossed 5537165 so it 
earned 25 million more as a result of the oscars 
a bestpicture oscar is important in this country but the 
biggest effect can be felt overseas it is vitally important in 
selling a film in foreign countries 
richard zanuck coproducer of driving miss daisy agrees 
being able to advertise winner of the academy award for best 
picture is a tremendous boost overseas also in the videocassette 
and other markets 
even the nominations gave miss daisy a tremendous boost and 
we were ready if our picture won the award 300 more theaters were 
added this week

the vietnambacked government 
having passed a crucial battlefield test appears more entrenched 
domestically and may make fewer compromises in negotiations to end 
the 11yearold civil war 
the avowed september pullout of vietnams forces left the 
untested and jittery phnom penh government facing a threeparty 
guerrilla coalition that includes the powerful khmer rouge 
initially the chinesearmed guerrillas made headway in 
northwest cambodia but as the monsoon season approaches signaling 
a slowdown in fighting the tide appears to have turned 
the khmer rouge has failed to take the northwests major city 
battambang the usbacked khmer peoples national liberation 
front is suffering sharp setbacks and troops loyal to overall 
coalition chief prince norodom sihanouk have yet to make 
significant gains 
although vietnams reinvolvement is denied by phnom penh the 
change of fortune appears at least in part to have been due to the 
return of some vietnamese troops this has not however detracted 
from the confidence evident among cambodian government officials 
i think theyre feeling pretty good about themselves theyve 
surprised themselves said one western aid official who requested 
anonymity theyre concerned about the future but they think 
they have compromised as much as they will can and need to 
knowledgeable diplomats caution about predictions for this 
volatile tragic country but sketch one possible scenario that 
sees phnom penh trying while coping with the civil war to slowly 
improve economic conditions and deepen political control 
eventually it would gain international recognition and aid 
few nations now recognize phnom penh but lowerlevel contacts 
have intensified in recent months phnom penh has hosted british 
and australian officials as well as former us secretary of state 
edmund muskie who called for changes in washingtons hostile 
policy toward indochina 
officials in this capital deny military successes will harden 
their stance at the conference table saying the draining half 
war half peace that exists is unacceptable 
look around you at this rundown country said pong peng 
cheng a senior advisor to prime minister hun sen how can you 
have development when war remains the top priority when 40 to 50 
percent of the budget goes to the military 
to date round after round of negotiations in paris jakarta 
and bangkok have failed despite a stack of peace plans and active 
participation by the worlds major powers 
a major obstacle to peace is the future role of the khmer rouge 
widely detested for its 197578 reign of terror when hundreds of 
thousands of people were killed but noncambodian diplomats 
involved in the negotiations also say leaders of the warring 
parties including hun sen and sihanouk are wary of making 
concessions that could dissipate the power they now wield 
each leadership group the diplomats say is gauging whether it 
could win a free election or a tussle for power in phnom penh 
should some kind of political solution be reached 
the hun sen government would have major handicaps at the polls 
it is communist in a country which has suffered the most radical of 
communist revolutions it is tainted by growing corruption which 
is admitted by officials and criticized with increasing vehemence 
by ordinary cambodians 
on the positive side the government follows liberal economic 
policies and last year allowed peasants to own plots of land 
recent rice harvests have been good with western aid sources 
estimating the country will face a 30000ton food deficit in 1990 
far less than in the earlier years 
un buntha a vice director in the planning ministry said that 
despite the continuing conflict cambodias gross national product 
increased by an estimated nine percent last year and further growth 
was anticipated 
but he admitted that the outside investment needed to revive 
cambodias shattered infrastructure was not forthcoming the 
foreigners are hesitating because they are afraid of the war and we 
do not yet have regulations and guarantees for investors he said 
in an interview 
a major phnom penh asset may be its enemy if it wasnt for 
the khmer rouge this government would have a very hard time 
mobilizing the people but with them out there they dont need 
much more said an international aid agency official 
the war however exacts a hefty price which may move the 
government towards political compromise observers say the mass 
conscription of young men the villages of widows and hospitals 
full of children maimed by mines may stoke hatred for the khmer 
rouge and its allies but it also creates bitterness against the 
phnom penh side

the head of a senate panel on military 
construction says the bush administration may as well forget about 
spending 11 billion to renovate the pentagon 
sen james sasser dtenn acknowledged monday that the 
47yearold building needs work but said the administrations call 
for 11 billion over seven years runs counter to a tide of 
shrinking budgets 
the military construction bill is going to get smaller not 
larger sasser told pentagon officials at a senate hearing 
theres simply no room for such an undertaking 
the chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
military construction faulted past defense secretaries for failing 
to get the general services administration to provide sufficient 
funds for the buildings upkeep 
the gsa owns the pentagon building with transfer of control to 
the defense department expected some time this year 
the pentagon the largest office building in the world has 175 
miles of corridors 131 stairways 19 escalators and 13 elevators 
and covers 29 acres in northern virginia

an overwhelming majority of the nations 
business leaders oppose a governmentrun national health plan

association of america

percent of the business executives surveyed would reject a 
healthcare system with a budget controlled by the states or the 
federal government

improving privatesector efforts to control healthcare costs and 
relying on the current level of government regulation while 31

corporate health care costs rose by 11 percent to 20 percent one 
in six said their costs were up 21 percent to 30 percent

and copayments and the workers share of premiums also 62 
percent said they have adopted managed care programs such as those 
based on health maintenance organizations and referred provider

noncommunist factions the conservative hungarian democratic 
forum and the liberal league of free democrats the socialists the 
successor to the communists who once ruled the warsaw pact nation

the tokyo stock exchanges key index rebounded from 
early losses and closed only marginally lower tuesday while the 
dollar extended its climb against the japanese yen to eight 
consecutive trading days 
the dollar closed at 15696 yen up 056 yen from mondays 
15640yen finish it opened at 15690 yen and ranged between 
15680 yen and 15720 yen the dollar gained 476 yen over eight 
days 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 1453 points or 005 
percent ending the day at 3182596 in the morning session it 
lost 34671 points 
although the index opened higher this morning because today is 
the start of a new fiscal year for majority of japanese companies 
it soon fell back as market players lacked energy to continue 
buying said a dealer with yamaichi securities co who requested 
anonymity 
its all because of the yens decline he added 
japans fiscal year begins april 1 but the new month for stock 
transaction starts four days prior to the calendar date 
the dealer said the market appeared to bottom out when the index 
dived below the 29000point mark last week but it will take time 
and continued ups and downs to recover even to the 33000point 
mark 
on monday the index gained 146833 points or 483 percent 
the second largest singleday gain ever on march 19 the index 
dived 135320 points to begin a threeday plunge that took it 
below 30000 points before it began rebounding last friday 
higher interest rates caused by the yens weakness also dampened 
interest in stocks dealers said 
the yield on the benchmark no 119 japanese government bond 
which rises when the price falls rose to 7255 percent from 717 
percent monday 
the dollar remained strong despite dollarselling by the bank of 
japan and selling by investors who sought to take profits at the 
157yen level said toru kanai a currency analyst with new japan 
securities co 
traders said the central bank sold the dollar actively to try to 
halt its rise but the amount sold was not immediately available 
the bank of japan does not comment officially on its market 
intervention 
the decline in share prices in part contributed to the 
yenselling kanai added 
the market now views the united states as allowing the current 
dollaryen rate since the fed took no immediate action even after 
the hashimotobrady meeting he said 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto and us treasury 
secretary nicholas brady met over the weekend and confirmed they 
would continue close coordination to maintain the stability of the 
exchange market but did not promise any steps to stop the dollars 
recent rise 
unless the united states shows a clear position on the 
appropriate dollar level the dollar wont stop rising kanai 
added 
meanwhile hashimoto told a postcabinet meeting news conference 
that events in lithuania were probably having a great effect on the 
exchange market political instability often increases demand for 
dollars because of the perceived safety of us investment 
he called the current dollaryen exchange rate a headache 
and said he was continuing to watch foreign exchange market 
movements with concern

couchbound bird watchers are entering 
a new television season watching their favorite stars two 
peregrine falcons in the permanent eye of a cable channels camera 
the camera mounted on the 21st story of a downtown office 
building clicked on again monday giving watchers a birds eye view 
of the falcons nest 
the falcons became tv stars last summer when the cable company 
mounted a camera near their nest on a ledge of the 23story monarch 
place office building the pictures were broadcast on a channel 
devoted to educational programming 
the show proved hugely popular with the cable outlets 43000 
subscribers and this year systems in westfield enfield longmeadow 
and northampton will also carry the falcons 
nobody else is using the public access channel so its entirely 
for the birds 
it amazes me that someone can sit and watch the birds hour 
after hour said brian lambert general manager of continental 
cablevision i am one of them it stays on in the office all day 
long we just kind of wait to see the bird move or the eggs or 
whatever its mesmerizing 
tom french director of the states endangered species program 
said the show is more than an entertaining glimpse of nature 
its an incredible opportunity he said its absolutely 
incredible that theyre so visible 
we often joke around the office that we spend tens and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars on new customer service features 
or new programming services and almost as a second thought we 
covered the peregrine falcons story and overnight it became an 
instant success lambert said 
running cable to the building and mounting the camera behind 
reflective glass cost about 10000 lambert said 
among the first season highlights were the first hatchings of 
young peregrine falcons in western massachusetts in 40 years and a 
june thriller when french rappelled down the side of the building 
to rescue a baby falcon that was choking on a piece of meat alert 
viewers had noticed the chicks distress and called in the 
situation to cable officials 
this season the first egg is expected to appear in early april 
the first hatching in midmay and the first fledgling flights near 
the end of june 
the show could have a long run because falcons mate for life 
and generally return to their nests year after year french said

abortion rights activists are threatening 
gov cecil andrus with severe economic consequences for his state 
if he signs the restrictive state abortion law to be planted on his 
desk today 
theyre organizing all over said gwen dempsey a republican 
state senate candidate in michigan who was meeting with andrus 
today she and others have been trying to generate a boycott of 
idaho potatoes if andrus refuses to veto the bill banning abortion 
as a means of birth control 
women can put a stop to it now by using their pocketbooks and 
make it a dead issue ms dempsey said 
the abortion bill was to reach andrus desk today but he wasnt 
expected to act immediately 
once the legislature adjourns by weeks end andrus will have 
10 days to make a decision if he decides not to act on the bill 
it becomes law and would still take effect july 1 
on monday andrus made his first public comments on the bill 
since it cleared the legislature last thursday the democratic 
governor acknowledged the boycott threats and the mounting pressure 
from both sides 
this issue has a tendency to polarize people more than 
anything i have seen andrus said i dont enjoy the threat of 
a boycott but that type of reactionary measure is normal in cases 
like this i would hope it wouldnt generate that much steam or 
interest 
antiabortion senators have said they have been receiving calls 
and letters from their supporters pledging to buy more idaho 
potatoes 
but despite his longstanding opposition to abortion except in 
cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother andrus 
said he had not decided yet whether to sign or veto the bill 
its a major piece of legislation that cannot be looked on 
lightly the governor said announcing he would consult 
unidentified outside experts 
the legislation would ban abortion except in cases involving a 
threat to the womans life or physical health severe fetal 
deformity incest if the victim is under 18 and nonstatutory rape 
reported within seven days 
based on a national right to life committee model rejected by 
other states as too restrictive it carries civil penalties against 
doctors performing illegal abortions 
abortion rights advocates said the bill is unconstitutional and 
have promised an immediate legal challenge should it become law 
that would give antiabortion forces the court test they want of 
the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing 
abortion 
since the bills approval last week prochoice activists have 
been holding nightly candlelight vigils outside the capitol

with the ink barely dry on a contra 
promise to disband by midapril usbacked rebels have streamed 
into nicaragua and their military leader says they wont disarm 
until the sandinista army does 
we are speaking of total demobilization that includes both 
ourselves and the sandinistas rebel military chief israel 
galeano said monday 
international observers said there appeared a split among the 
contras over the pact signed friday in honduras rebel loyalty 
seemed divided between oscar sovalbarro a commander who signed the 
agreement and galeano who did not 
the sandinistas defeated at the polls last month have said 
they wont hand over control of the army and police to the new 
government headed by violeta chamorro until the usbacked rebels 
turn in their weapons 
there were reports of intensified fighting and in washington 
the state department asked the united nations to increase the 
number of observers it is sending to the region to so tensions can 
be kept at a minimum 
the 200member force is to monitor the disbanding of the contras 
and tranfer of power from the longruling leftist sandinistas to 
mrs chamorros victorious alliance 
representatives of mrs chamorro negotiated fridays accord 
which says contras in honduran camps will demobilize by april 20 
five days before the conservative coalition takes office 
but the agreement sets no deadline for disbanding rebels on 
nicaraguan territory now at least half the 12000man contra army 
galeano said it was unrealistic to expect immediate 
demobilization 
an eightyear process cannot be decided by the dismantling of 
an organization in 15 days he said 
most of the contra army that set up camps in honduras after us 
military aid ended in 1988 began returning to nicaragua in 
september as many as 4000 were believed in nicaragua by the feb 
25 elections 
sovalbarro who negotiated the accord for the contras said 
monday that an insurgent military contingent of 2000 rebel 
fighters has returned since friday and its numbers could 
increase at any moment 
contra bases across the border in yamales honduras are 
practically empty according to journalists and international 
observers 
they have become ghost camps theres just a few of them left 
there one international observer said on condition of anonmity 
fridays accord also calls for an immediate ceasefire a 
provision the sandinistas say the contras have already violated 
the defense ministry said that on friday a dozen soldiers and 
four rebels were killed when 100 contras ambushed sandinista 
troops mrs chamorros newspaper la prensa condemned the attack 
as terrorism and insisted the contras disband without fail 
and without pretext 
the ministry also reported a 30minute firefight between 
soldiers and rebels on sunday it said that on the same day 100 
contras seized a truck robbed the passengers of cash and jewelry 
and demanded the owner pay a 500 ransom 
sovalbarro denied there had been any fighting 
it is totally false he said it was made up to fit the 
interests of the sandinistas 
sovalbarro said rebel fighters inside nicaragua were under 
orders to avoid combat but maintain their positions 
all clashes took place near the provincial capital of jinotega 
100 miles northeast of managua on the honduran border jinotega 
province is the northern tip of a corridor used by the contras to 
infiltrate nicaragua 
whether or not the rebels disband by the april deadline appears 
to depend on which contra leader is talking 
while galeano insists on bilateral disarmament some field 
commanders say they will hand over their guns as soon as the united 
nations team arrives both galeano and sovalbarro deny any 
differences between them 
the agreement reached with the new government of nicaragua 
surprised our combatants at first sovalbarro said but now we 
are all happy over what happened 
should there be a split one international observer said galeano 
would command the loyalty of about 60 percent of fighters while 40 
percent would follow sovalbarro 
the demobilization pact says the contras inside nicaragua will 
move into secure zones monitored by the united nations and 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the archbishop of managua 
a united nations team is gathering in nicaragua and another is 
already in honduras

census form 
the pets name was included on the mailbox of steve and carole 
shanks when census workers went doortodoor in 1988 to identify 
rural route addresses 
that may be why the couples census form was addressed to their 
5yearold cat the census bureau said

the leader of a 3yearold armed 
insurrection in this south american country was arrested after a 
shootout with soldiers in which two of his security guards were 
killed the military said 
ronny brunswijk leader the jungle commando guerilla group was 
arrested monday on drug charges and was being held at an army post 
in the capital of paramaribo military spokesman borger breeveld 
said on state television 
breeveld said the charges were related to brunswijks 
announcement sunday that his men had seized more than a ton of 
unrefined cocaine from four colombians forced by bad weather to 
land their plane near one of his bases 
breeveld did not say where brunswijk was arrested but it was 
believed to have been somewhere in the capital where the guerrilla 
leader had been since friday for talks on ending the jungle 
commando insurgency 
the spokesman said two of brunswijks security guards were 
killed when they tried to intervene and an unspecified number of 
brunswijks aides taken into custody 
the peace talks had broken off over brunswijks demands for 
continued authority in the jungle interior of this former dutch 
colony his guerrilla group has found support among descendants of 
african slaves who live in the interior and comprise about 50000 
of the countrys 400000 population 
officials said president ransewak shankar dispatched minister of 
justice jules ajodhia and deputy vice president willy soemita to 
army headquarters to discuss the arrest with the army general 
staff leading to speculation the government had not been consulted 
beforehand 
lt col desi bouterse the armed forces commander and former 
ruler of suriname has opposed a tentative peace agreement reached 
in june on the grounds it failed to disarm the jungle commando 
which is believed to number between 200 and 400 men 
brunswijk is a former bodyguard of bouterse

jailed as an army deserter in cuba the mariel 
refugee charged with setting the nightclub fire that killed 87 
people was described as a street hustler who recently lost his job 
and girlfriend 
julio gonzalez 36 was moved monday from the rikers island jail 
to the psychiatric ward at kings county hospital where he was 
under a suicide watch said ruby ryles a spokeswoman for the city 
corrections department 
gonzalez charged with murdering 87 people by torching the happy 
land social club early sunday had no prior criminal record 
gonzalez told immigration officials when he arrived in the 
united states in 1980 that he had portrayed himself as a drug 
trafficker to cuban authorities in order to get kicked out of cuba 
duke austin a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service told the new york times 
there was no evidence gonzalez was involved with drugs here 
officials said 
us officials have complained that many of the 125000 people 
kicked out of cuba in the boatlift had criminal records or mental 
disorders others were simply dissatisfied with life in cuba 
gonzalez reportedly lost his last job at a lamp factory about 
six months ago detective james malvey said gonzalez since had 
hustled money washing cars and peddling 
for the past three months gonzalez has lived in an 80aweek 
furnished room in the bronx before that he had lived with 
45yearold lydia feliciano 
he was just a normal guy said ray davis the building 
manager hes a nice quiet clean guy 
gonzalez allegedly told police he torched the club after 
quarreling with ms feliciano 
franco mena who showed up at the club after the fire said he 
and another man prevailed on ms feliciano to identify gonzalez as 
the arsonist she didnt want to talk because she thought nobody 
had heard her argument mena said 
bronx district attorney robert johnson said gonzalezs shoes 
still reeked of gasoline when he was arrested at his apartment 12 
hours after the fire 
according to immigration records gonzalez arrived in the united 
states at key west fla on may 31 1980 as part of the mariel 
boatlift 
he was detained at camp mccoy wis then fort chaffee ark 
until feb 21 1981 when he was released said verne jervis of the 
immigration service 
he was sent to live with a sponsor family in new york the 
agency that handled that placement said it was still looking for 
gonzalez records 
gonzalez told federal officials that he was in a cuban prison 
from 1971 to 1974 for desertion but that account had not been 
confirmed officials said 
jervis said gonzalez had never applied for permanent residence 
which makes him deportable after doing time for a criminal offense

children with a deadly bone cancer 
are being injected with microscopic drugcarrying bubbles of fat 
in hopes that the experimental therapy will work where chemotherapy 
has failed a researcher says 
while it is too soon to tell if the strategy is working some 
early signs give encouragement said eugenie kleinerman of the md 
anderson cancer center in houston 
the approach may also help some day with other forms of cancer 
she said monday at a science writers seminar sponsored by the 
american cancer society 
the patients in her study have osteosarcoma a childhood bone 
cancer that produces some 700 cases a year in the united states 
the cancer is treated with surgery to remove the bone tumor 
plus chemotherapy to attack cancer cells that have spread elsewhere 
in the body 
nonetheless some 30 percent to 40 percent of patients die from 
cancer that had spread to their lungs before surgery kleinerman 
said 
her therapy is aimed at destroying microscopic tumors in the 
lung by activating white cells called monocytes in the blood and 
others called macrophages in lung tissue when activated these 
cells kill cancerous cells she said 
the white cells can be turned on by a drug called muramyl 
tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine abbreviated as mtppe she 
said 
the drug is enclosed in the tiny fat bubbles because monocytes 
and macrophages readily digest them once devoured a bubble spills 
its load of mtppe activating the cell to fight cancer 
in this fashion the drug can be delivered only to the desired 
cells which cuts down on side effects kleinerman said 
the bubbles called liposomes are about the size of red blood 
cells she said 
in mice the strategy was able to eliminate cancer that had 
spread to the lung she said it also worked in dogs even without 
help from chemotherapy she said 
the current study has so far enrolled 14 children for whom 
chemotherapy has failed and whose cancers have spread to the lung 
participants have been getting liposomes bearing mtppe 
intravenously twice a week as an outpatients for three months or 
six months an earlier study showed that side effects are minimal 
including fever and chills 
kleinerman said it is too early to see if the strategy is 
working in the new study but participants lungs show dead cancer 
cells and scar tissue around tumors indicating that the treatment 
is having some kind of effect she said 
if the liposome strategy does work she said she hopes it will 
be combined with chemotherapy after the initial bone tumor is 
removed the idea is that the activated monocytes and macrophages 
would kill cancer cells that resist the chemotherapy 
she also said the strategy may pay off for other cancers that 
spread to the lung such as the skin cancer melanoma or which 
spread to the liver such as colon cancer liposomes are taken up 
by the liver and spleen as well as the lung she said 
asked about prospects for treating lung cancer she said she 
knew of no studies of that possibility 
john weinstein of the national cancer institute who has studied 
liposomes said previous studies give a good rationale for going 
forward with the work kleinerman is doing

a stunned neighborhood near the bronx zoo tried 
to comprehend why many of its sons and daughters perished inside a 
social club in the citys third worst fire 
i told my son not to go there he told me he wasnt going 
there said eledia alvarez whose 22yearold son danny was one 
of the 87 people who died in the fire early sunday 
police cars and fire rescue trucks were still parked monday near 
the happy land social club with its incongruous name and yellow 
happy face above a fireblackened entrance and a single barred 
window 
several hundred people loitering behind the blue police 
sawhorses shook their heads or shrugged when asked if they knew 
julio gonzalez 36 he is alleged to have poured gasoline in the 
doorway of the illegal nightspot and then set it afire trapping 
partyers in an upstairs dance area most suffocated before they 
could flee down the two narrow stairways 
classes were underway as usual at public school 67 which on 
sunday served as the clearing house for families and friends to 
view police photographs of the victims on monday a task force of 
seven city state and private agencies was still using part of the 
building to help relatives make funeral arrangements 
the city offered 900 to survivors who need burial assistance 
and the state crime victims board will pay up to 2500 
mrs alvarez was among some 200 relatives and friends who 
returned for that purpose they spoke with disgust about how the 
happy land was able to operate despite having been ordered by city 
authorities to close and with sorrow that some people continued to 
patronize it despite its reputation as an unsafe place 
rene j mena 63 said his 30yearold son rene jr the oldest 
of 10 children and himself the father of three had invited him to 
go out on saturday night 
i told him i didnt want to go to that place that is a very 
dangerous place and im not going there 
rene jr died in the fire

soviet troops left behind broken and 
overturned iron bedsteads scattered mattresses and a trail of 
blood today after storming a hospital to arrest lithuanians who 
fled the red army 
in the ward where about 36 deserters had been staying a 
soldiers wool hat with the soviet army insignia torn off lay on 
one cot two feet away a halfeaten loaf of black bread rested on 
a white sheet 
ironbarred windows were broken 
a trail of blood led down the hospital steps and out the front 
door 
they beat them with their fists a duty nurse at the 
psychiatric hospital in vilnius said i was afraid they would 
shoot me 
the hospital was one of at least two raided by soviet troops 
making good on moscows promise to arrest lithuanian deserters who 
hadnt returned to barracks by saturday 
after their government declared itself independent on march 11 
hundrds of young lithuanians fled the soviet army and many sought 
refuge in the hospitals 
the middleaged nurse grew increasingly hysterical as she 
recounted her story for reporters at the hospital after the 
predawn occupation 
she said two truckloads of soldiers drove up to the hospital and 
beat on the front door before being let in she said they rushed up 
the stairs to the secondfloor ward where the young men were 
staying often surrounded in the daytime by soviet and foreign 
journalists 
she said about two dozen men were beaten and taken away while 
another 12 were able to escape two lithuanian policemen were also 
beaten when they sought to intervene 
an abc television crew arriving at the scene was held at 
gunpoint by soldiers and forced to surrender videotape 
they told us not to move said andrzej lewandowski a member 
of the news crew his colleague chris burzynski said the soldiers 
made them take all equipment out of their car and seized their 
videocassettes 
in kaunas about 65 miles west of the capital soviet soldiers 
took over the red cross hospital which served as a sanctuary set 
up for the deserters by the lithuanian government a police officer 
said 
about 50 soldiers arrived in five trucks said the officer who 
did not identify himself 
they broke down doors and rousted all patients looking for 
soldiers he said they asked all likely young men and wound up

atop the rickety wooden staircase the dance 
floor trembled under heels tapping and shuffling to the beat that 
shifted from salsa to calypso disco lights glittered on silk 
clothes saturday nights finest 
suddenly flames roaring in the bottom floor turned the top room 
into a blast furnace within seconds superheated gases and thick 
smoke had silenced the place only a handful had escaped 
the 5 cover was a small price to pay for a night out in the 
poor latino community of east tremont near the bronx zoo people 
dressed up nice and they partied hard 
the whole floor moved with the music it was sleazy and very 
very hot said denise garcia 20 people liked to go there and 
show off 
lately the patrons say the mostly honduran clientele had 
expanded to include other hispanics sometimes a gun or a knife 
flashed or someone whipped out a crack vial 
three of the victims played amateur soccer for a bronx team 
named after one of the big teams in honduras where many of the 
youths hoped to return some day 
they all dreamed of returning with more money they were full 
of hispanic machismo said their coach miguel reyes 
at about 315 am sunday there was a ruckus downstairs in the 
tiny entryway a bearded cuban patron was harassing his former 
girlfriend who worked at the club and a bouncer was called over 
dont push me dont push me the patron said according to 
witnesses and then ill be back 
the man identified as julio gonzalez 36 angered by his 
rejection by exgirlfriend lydia feliciano fetched gasoline from a 
service station according to police 
then he stood at the clubs exit and splashed the fuel on the 
floor and wall inside then he struck a match 
the happy land social clubs name referred to america regular 
patrons said a place of hope for the young immigrants who 
frequented the club 
when the fire allegedly lighted by gonzalez took fire 
investigators said the ground floor became an inferno the 
windowless second floor where all but 18 of the 87 victims were 
found was a gas chamber with walltowall bodies 
the few survivors included ms feliciano gonzalez under 
suicide watch at a psychiatric ward is charged with 87 murders 
long after dawn a stream of corpses left the happy land on 
stretchers covered with white sheets 
some died instantly rescue workers told of finding victims with 
glasses in their hands others were sitting at the bar their legs 
still wound around bar stools 
lungs are seared by hot gases and it becomes impossible to 
take a second breath said dr alexander kuehl director of 
emergency medicine at new york hospital and when there is not 
enough oxygen coming in to feed the fire you get carbon monoxide 
which can kill you in a minute 
it was a huge rush of superheated poison gas we call it a 
flashover it is instant if you are breathing in it is deadly 
said zachary goldfarb emergency medical service deputy chief of 
operations 
some victims facing the wall of fire that came from downstairs 
frantically tried to escape bodies were piled four deep by the 
upstairs door a testament to their desperation 
you cant imagine what went on in there you cant imagine 
what these people did to try to survive said firefighter dennis 
devlin 
there was one woman who looked to be holding onto her 
boyfriend for dear life said emergency medical services worker 
kerry naughton there was a man lying over a woman as if he was 
trying to shield her with his body 
there was no sprinkler system on the ground floor the 
sprinklers on the second floor discharged after 87 people were 
dead authorities said firefighters arrived in a few minutes but 
there were no screams no cries

two brothers pleaded innocent to 
the shotgun slaying of their parents that police said was carried 
out to obtain a 14 million inheritance 
erik menendez 19 and lyle menendez 22 stood solemnly as they 
entered their pleas before municipal court judge judith o stein 
the two could face the death penalty if convicted 
the pair chatted quietly before the proceedings began 
occasionally smiling and turning to nod at relatives sitting in the 
packed courtroom 
the two stood as ms stein read the charges against them two 
counts each of murder with allegations of committing the killings 
for financial gain lying in wait with a shotgun and committing 
multiple murders 
the sons are accused of killing their father hollywood film 
executive jose menendez 45 and their mother former beauty queen 
kitty menendez 44 so they could inherit the couples fortune 
ms stein set an april 9 date for them to return to municipal 
court for pretrial motions and the setting of a preliminary hearing 
date 
at that time the judge will consider a prosecution motion to 
unseal paperwork containing the evidence prosecutors say justified 
a search of the office of family psychologist jerome oziel 
at issue is whether taperecorded conversations between the 
brothers and oziel may be used as evidence in the case 
such therapy sessions like conferences with doctors and 
lawyers are generally not admissible in court but exceptions can 
be made in cases where threats are made 
deputy district attorney eliott alhadeff said the privilege had 
been violated because threats were made during the conversations 
with oziel he also suggested some conversations took place outside 
a therapistpatient relationship 
but lyle menendezs attorney gerald chaleff said he believes 
none of the tapes are admissible 
without the tapes chaleff said he believes the case is highly 
circumstantial and one that can be proved only if they are assumed 
to be guilty 
prosecutors say the sons fired repeated shotgun blasts at their 
parents as the couple watched television last august in an upstairs 
den in the familys beverly hills mansion 
the killings were so bloody and clues so few that many in 
hollywood believed the harddriving menendez had been killed by 
mobsters they thought he might have run afoul of organized crime 
in his role as head of live entertainment a video company 
affiliated with carolco pictures the producer of the rambo 
movies and other action films 
after more than six months of investigation police arrested the 
sons the motive was greed they said

a man whose rape and mutilation of a 
7yearold boy sparked a rewriting of sexual predator laws was 
ordered imprisoned for 131 years by a judge who called him a 
danger to the defenseless 
pierce county superior court judge thomas r sauriol sentenced 
earl kenneth shriner on monday to three times the maximum standard 
term under state law even with time off for good behavior sauriol 
noted shriner still would have to serve more than 88 years 
shriner diagnosed as slightly retarded had a 25year history 
of violence against young people his case galvanized public 
efforts to get repeat sexual offenders off the street the state 
legislature enacted a strong sexual predator law 
sauriol told shriner the crime had angered and troubled him more 
than any in his 37year legal career 
i dont think that i have ever heard of a case that borders on 
extreme cruelty more than this one sauriol said the reality 
is mr shriner you present a danger to the defenseless 
shriner who did not testify in his own defense said nothing 
the 40yearold shriner was convicted feb 7 of firstdegree 
attempted murder two counts of firstdegree rape and firstdegree 
assault in the may 20 1989 attack on a 7yearold boy in a wooded 
area near their homes in south tacoma the boy was raped choked 
and had his penis cut off 
neighbors said they found the boy naked bloody covered with 
mud and practically incoherent a jail inmate testified during the 
trial that shriner admitted mutilating the boy who has since 
undergone reconstructive surgery 
the boy who identified shriner in court as his attacker was 
not present the victims mother helen harlow dabbing her eyes 
and comforted by friends said she was satisfied with the sentence 
deputy prosecutor barbara coreyboulet said i think that it 
served the purpose 
defense attorney dino sepe said he would appeal the verdict and 
the sentence 
if the convictions stand defense attorneys said shriners 
sentence should have been within the standard range of 34 years to 
43 years 10 months 
harlows voice broke as she described to the court how the 
attack had shattered her and her sons lives 
it all comes down to forgiveness she told the judge if 
we are to forgive him it will be in the context of knowing that we 
are safe from him 
in sentencing shriner sauriol criticized legislation that would 
have permitted a 75 percent reduction in prison terms for sex 
offenders who voluntarily submit to surgical castration 
the measure died in the state house of representatives after 
clearing the senate this year coreyboulet had argued for a longer 
prison term partly because a similar bill might one day become law 
shriner was declared a defective delinquent in 1965 after 
choking a 7yearold girl the term now abandoned referred to 
violenceprone juveniles with emotional or mental problems 
he subsequently was confined at rainier school for the retarded 
western state hospital a mental institution and the washington 
corrections center where he served 10 years for assaulting two 
16yearold hitchhikers

japanese lawmakers meeting with washington 
officials today balked at american demands they enact broad 
economic reforms to help shrink the 49 billion us trade deficit 
with japan 
in trade talks last week us officials urged japan to revise 
landuse policies streamline its retail distribution system and 
increase government spending in order to boost consumption of 
imports 
lawmakers attending the breakfast meeting said us embassy 
officials were told the reforms would be difficult to achieve 
quickly 
at prime minister toshiki kaifus request the japanese 
government has drawn up proposals aimed at meeting the us 
requests made during the ongoing trade talks in remarks to 
parliament japanese officials have said the reforms should be 
undertaken for the sake of japanese consumers 
but some leaders of the governing liberal democratic party are 
less conciliatory toward the united states said party lawmaker 
takujiro hamada who chaired todays meeting 
the parliamentarians said resistance to the reforms was very 
strong in their constituencies hamada said 
another liberal democratic lawmaker ichiji ishii said the 
opinions expressed by the japanese legislators were rather severe 
they said the menu of us demands was much too big he 
said 
japanese newspapers have said us officials gave japan a list 
of more than 200 suggestions aimed at eliminating structural 
barriers washington says prevent foreign companies from entering 
japanese markets 
japan says problems on the us side also contribute to the 
trade imbalance 
in the latest round of trade talks last week japan suggested 
the united states raise taxes wean itself from energywasting cars 
and limit the use of credit cards the mass circulation newspaper 
yomiuri shimbun reported 
the suggestions were among 80 japanese proposals for cutting the 
us federal budget deficit increasing savings and investment and 
improving worker training and education the paper said the 
measures were designed to boost the competitiveness of american 
exports it said 
acccording to hamada the powerful former foreign minister 
shintaro abe said charges japan had done nothing to resolve the 
trade imbalance were absolutely wrong 
it seems almost as if japan is being scolded for having such a 
powerful competitive economy hamada said 
japan and the united states are both to come up with interim 
reports on the trade talks in early april a final report is 
expected in july

for better or worse or until billions do them 
part says the lawyer for ivana trump who thinks his client should 
get half of her estranged husbands fortune which he estimated at 
5 billion 
mrs trumps lawyers said in papers filed monday that she does 
not intend to file for divorce despite allegations that trump in 
1987 was engaging in adulterous relationships including the 
notorious relationship with marla maples 
she wants to preserve the family unit her attorney michael 
kennedy said at an afternoon news conference 
lawyers for trump refused to comment on the allegation of 
adultery and said the papers were legally and factually 
deficient 
they have 20 days to file a response 
the papers filed monday state that mrs trump never waived the 
right to an equitable share of the properties trump accumulated 
during their 13year marriage 
kennedy said mrs trumpe was not advised by her former attorney 
lawrence h levner of her right to up to half the property 
acquired by either partner during the marriage as provided by the 
1980 state domestic relations law 
trump attorneys jay goldberg and stan lotwin called the action a 
low blow 
they denied kennedys assertion that trump had forced his wife 
to accept levner as her lawyer 
levner declined to comment 
goldberg said mrs trumps claim to be a worldly wise and 
knowledgeable woman who made significant contributions to the 
trump empire was inconsistent with her assertion that she was 
unaware of her rights when she signed a 1987 postmarital agreement 
kennedy denied reports that the contract called for mrs trump 
to receive 25 million in the event the marriage broke up 
golderg called the move by mrs trump a pressure tactic 
designed to force a settlement 
he will not surrender goldberg said of trump through his 
own brains he made it she took care of the kids and did the 
laundry 
asked if trump intended to file for divorce lotwin said he 
has really left his options open 
the trumps marital problems came to light last month when the 
developer left his wife setting off a geyser of headlines and 
speculation about trumps relationships with other women

the downtown music center to glittery parties thronged by hoards of 
fans 
was it a good show you can never tell when youre there 
said anjelica huston at a bash at the mondrian hotel monday night 
miss huston wandered around the palm treelined patio with the 
likes of rob lowe dudley moore billy crystal christina applegate 
and former california gov jerry brown 
oliver stone winner of the best director oscar for born on 
the fourth of july was mobbed in the lobby by autographseeking 
fans he posed briefly for pictures with crystal and was hustled 
into an elevator 
a few blocks up sunset boulevard hundreds of squealing fans 
cheered a procession of limousines dropping off passengers at the 
prestigious spago party put on by literary agent irving swifty 
lazar inside guests dined on wolfgang pucks famous pizza and 
pasta 
back downtown the prestigious board of governors ball took on 
the festive atmosphere of what it must have been like when the 
academy awards were celebrated in ballrooms at local hotels 
the music center patrons had only to move a few yards into a 
huge white tent with oversized balloons at the top 
winners and losers congregated around the dance floor and 
congratulated and commiserated with each other in a communal spirit 
rarely seen in todays hollywood 
warren beatty and jack nicholson who handed out the best 
picture award to driving miss daisy checked out the scene and 
chatted with friends like jessica lange and daryl hannah 
best actress winner jessica tandy and her husband of 47 years 
hume cronyn accepted congratulations at their table while martin 
scorsese spike lee and danny aiello represented the new york crowd 
in their own corner 
mighty good show commented oscar winner gregory peck who 
presented the award to miss tandy for her starring role in 
driving miss daisy 
the air at the governors ball was largely one of 
selfcongratulation with the 3hour show drawing plaudits from 
those who attended academy president karl malden quieted the crowd 
to introduce gilbert cates who produced the 62nd oscar 
presentation 
cates acknowledged that he was trying something unique in the 
satellite feeds from four foreign capitals but general opinion was 
that the gimmick worked 
earlier in the day former president ronald reagan and his wife 
nancy kicked off the third annual oscar night gala to benefit 
athletes and entertainers for kids at a beverly hills hotel 
reagan told 40 disadvantaged and sick youngsters from various 
hospitals and inner city community centers that people indeed care 
about them 
were so proud of each and every one of you for your strength 
and courage reagan said before handing out yoyos 
mrs reagan in an emotional voice said i know its tough 
but youll make it i just want to say im proud of you and i love

solidarity leader lech walesa today 
appealed to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to halt red army 
pressure on lithuania and open a dialogue with the 
independenceminded republic 
walesa said gorbachevs reform policies including his decision 
to end the communist partys monopoly on power were unquestioned 
achievements possible only because of the soviet leaders bold 
politics 
but in a letter addressed to the soviet president and released 
by solidarity headquarters in gdansk walesa expressed grave 
concern over soviet moves in neighboring lithuania 
i am filled with greatest anxiety by the soviet actions in 
lithuania walesa said of todays arrests of lithuanian deserters 
from the soviet army and occupation of communist party buildings in 
the republic 
in the letter the solidarity leader said the actions were in 
striking contradiction with the spirit of the policy you have been 
carrying out for years 
walesa who led the political forces that ended communist rule 
in poland warned that recent history in eastern europe has shown 
military force to not be an effective means of resolving political 
problems 
violating the sovereignty of lithuania is an action directed 
against the process of constructing a new democratic order in 
europe walesa said i turn to you mr president to abandon 
the practice of military pressure and undertake political dialogue 
with the lithuanian government 
the polish government supports lithuanias drive for 
selfdetermination 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania and the two other 
baltic republics of latvia and estonia in 1940 the republic 
declared its independence from moscow on march 11 
a hihgpowered polish parliamentary delegation arrived in 
lithuania on friday for talks with lithuanian president vytautas

in a case seen as a test of alleged unfair barriers 
to entering the japanese market the government has agreed to 
consider a us toy companys move to open a store in the country 
officials said today 
toys r us has announced plans to open a 53800squarefoot 
discount store in niigata 160 miles northwest of tokyo 
local shopkeepers were strongly opposing the move news reports 
said under japans largescale retail stores law designed to 
protect small retailers they must be consulted before the opening 
of any large stores in their areas 
while some japanese retailers have had to wait up to 10 years 
for permission to set up large new stores consideration is under 
way to shorten the maximum waiting period required under the law to 
two years said an official of the ministry of international 
trade and industry 
the minister for international trade kabun muto told a news 
conference today that he urged his aides to work out plans to 
shorten the consultation process required under the law 
the ministry and local agencies in niigata prefecture agreed 
monday to start procedures for the storeopening plan by paramus 
njbased toys r us said the ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the official of the ministrys industrial policy bureau said 
local retailers will receive an advance explanation of the plan by 
midapril 
the us company then is to submit formal notification of the 
plan to the trade minister and deliberations by a group of local 
retailers consumers and scholars will follow he said 
the largescale retail stores law has been among targets of us 
officials seeking changes in what are seen as structural barriers 
that contribute to the united states 49 billion deficit in trade 
with japan 
in addition to making entry to japans market difficult for 
foreign retailers it works against larger japanese stores that 
would be more likely to carry foreign products us officials say 
japan says us economic practices such as widespread credit 
purchases also contribute to the trade imbalance

twas a fine night for the irish said 
gregory peck at the governors ball following the 62nd academy 
awards 
and for the english the italians the japanese and americans 
the first international academy awards were truly that both in 
award giving and in the programs origins 
the academy voters gave their prized trophy without concern for 
chauvinism and with a pervading prejudice for humanism 
the irish were triumphant with my left foot winning oscars 
for daniel daylewis as best actor and brenda fricker as supporting 
actress 
although daylewis is english miss fricker is irish through and 
through so too is my left foot filmed in dublin on a 25 
million shoestring budget 
its the saga of a curious irish hero christy brown the 
cerebral palsy victim who vanquished superhuman odds to become an 
acclaimed artist and writer using only his foot to communicate 
cinema paradiso was a popular winner for best foreign 
language film the italian movie like monday nights oscar cast 
celebrates the love of film it tells the story of a village boy 
who spends much of his youth in the projection room of the local 
movie house 
jessica tandy londonborn and now a us citizen added to the 
internationalism with her best actress win for driving miss 
daisy 
americans also figured in the honors notably denzel washington 
as supporting actor in glory and oliver stone for directing 
born on the fourth of july 
the academy voters were not impressed by the megabuck achievers 
awarding one lesser oscar apiece to indiana jones and the last 
crusade and batman 
their principal concern seemed to be the human condition 
whether it entailed race relations driving miss daisy and 
glory or the plight of the handicapped my left foot and 
born on the fourth of july 
in one of the evenings most heartwarming and significant 
events steven spielberg and george lucas presented a special award 
to akira kurosawa considered by many critics as the greatest 
living filmmaker 
kurosawa was greeted by fellow workers in japan who led a 
happy birthday serenade the director of the seven samurai 
and ran reached 80 last weekend 
satellite feeds from london moscow sydney and buenos aires 
gave diversity to the telecast even though jack lemmon was 
subjected to a triple echo in moscow 
despite its bloated length at more than 3 hours the music 
center ceremony generally got good reviews from those attending 
billy crystal was a popular emcee his flashes of humor almost 
always on target 
oscar organizers say there seems to be no way to reduce the 
excessive length unless a halfdozen or more awards are eliminated 
or given offcamera a move to do either would meet with screams 
from the academys various category divisions 
the academy has long preached that all the nominees are winners 
and that theme was carried out for a second consecutive year 
instead of the timeworn phrase and the winner is the 
presenters were instructed to say and the oscar goes to 
that may be of some consolation to the losers then again 
probably not

european leaders today urged the soviet union to 
end its military show of force in lithuania and to hold talks with 
leaders of the baltic republic 
at nato headquarters and in capitals across the continent 
leaders warned that todays storming of hospitals sheltering soviet 
army deserters as well as the weekend display of military might 
could slow democratic reforms in eastern europe and damage 
eastwest relations 
polands solidarity leader lech walesa sent a letter to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev expressing the greatest anxiety 
about events in the lithuanian capital of vilnius 
violating the sovereignty of lithuania is an action directed 
against the process of constructing a new democratic order in 
europe walesa said 
i turn to you mr president to abandon the practice of 
military pressure and undertake political dialogue with the 
lithuanian government he said 
norways prime minister jan p syse called moscows parading of 
tanks and order to confiscate firearms a shockingly unwise step 
they have made an already tense situation dangerously acute 
mondays cautious hope for negotiations and dialogue today 
emerge as a tactical game a completely destructive course from 
which we sharply dissociate syse said in a statement 
it is now crucial that soviet leaders express willingness to 
negotiate before the situation gets entirely out of control 
continued use of power will not solve any problems but can 
seriously jeopardize the results recently achieved in eastwest 
relations 
at nato headquarters in brussels senior officials monitoring 
events in lithuania fear adverse developments there could hurt 
the improved eastwest climate an alliance official said 
if the situation is not solved peacefully through 
negotiations it could derail a lot of other things said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said senior political officers of the 16 nations of the north 
atlantic treaty organization met in a special session on monday and 
continued their talks today 
after mondays closeddoor discussions the official said 
there was a sense of the people at the meeting that talks between 
gorbachev and the lithuanians should take place in an atmosphere 
free of intimidation or pressure of any kind 
he said it was also the feeling of those at the meeting that 
any adverse developments in lithuania would have consequences for 
positive international political trends 
he declined to elaborate on the possible consequences 
the dutch government issued a statement expressing its worry 
about the increasing pressure that is being exacted on the 
lithuanian population through a military show of force 
the dutch urged moscow to use maximum restraint to 
peacefully solve the conflict with lithuania along political 
lines 
the british foreign office had no comment today referring 
reporters to prime minister margaret thatchers statement in the 
house of commons last week 
she said then that britain supports lithuanias desire to 
determine its own future and that it never recognized moscows 
annexation of the baltic republics

rival centerright and liberal parties 
plotted strategies today to try to win enough support in runoff 
elections to form hungarys first postwar noncommunist government 
final results of the countrys first free elections in 43 years 
remained unavailable this afternoon two days after the last of 
millions of voters cast ballots for the 394seat parliament 
a final tally from the 11000 polls was not expected before late 
today and janos nemeth chairman of the national electoral 
committee blamed the interior ministry because its electoral 
office was supplying incomplete information on the voting to the 
committee 
nemeth did not specify whether he thought the interior ministry 
which many hungarians continue to associate with communist 
repression because of its control of internal security was 
willfully delaying results showing a poor performance by the 
oldguard communist party 
an interior ministry official who declined to give his name on 
the telephone denied the the delay was deliberate he said it was 
due to the slow transmission of data to the ministry from outlying 
polling stations 
more than 70 percent of hungarys 78 million eligible voters 
cast ballots election officials said by late monday only five of 
the seats were decided 
with more than 80 percent of the ballots cast for 29 parties 
running counted the conservative hungarian democratic forum led 
with 247 percent of the vote the centerleft league of free 
democrats had 216 percent and the ruralbased independent 
smallholders was in third with 119 percent 
the democratic forum wants to move more slowly than the free 
democrats toward marketoriented reform in grappling with an 
economy beset by doubledigit inflation and a 20 billion foreign 
debt after four decades of communist rule 
neither of the two leading parties garnered anything close to 
the absolute majority needed for decisive victory making a 
coalition government likely after runoff elections are held next 
month possibly on april 8 
democratic forum chairman joszef antall said the independent 
smallholders would be his first choice as coalition partners and 
like the free democrats he dismissed any idea of working with the 
socialists 
far back in fourth place with 107 percent were the ruling 
socialists the successors of the old communist party who 
campaigned on a democratic platform but apparently were still 
associated by voters with the communist past 
the apparent aversion to anything that smacked of socialism 
accounted for the poor showing by the social democrats who hadnt 
managed to clear the 4 percent hurdle needed to gain representation 
in parliament 
voters in east germany on march 18 had a similar reaction to 
four decades of communist rule choosing a conservative coalition 
the oldstyle communists who refused to join the reform wing in 
founding the socialist party last october also fared badly their 
leader gyula thuermer finished a distant fifth in a western 
district and the party also failed to clear the 4 percent hurdle 
preliminary results showed 
among the five seats decided outright were three taken by 
democratic forum members and one by premier miklos nemeth a reform 
communist the socialist party cofounder and chief supporter of 
democracy nemeth ran as an independent in his home riding of 
szerencs 70 miles northeast of budapest 
nemeth said his outgoing government should receive credit for 
leading the nation to sundays historic vote

military ruler gen saw maung today 
rejected criticism of his governments mass resettlement program 
and charges of official corruption in narcotics trafficking 
in a speech during the annual armed forces day in rangoon the 
general who seized power in 1988 said foreign news organizations 
are interfering with burmas internal affairs by broadcasting such 
critical reports 
i hereby categorically deny all these groundless accusations 
as totally false saw maung said 
foreign media have quoted western diplomats in rangoon as saying 
the government has moved up to a half million people from urban 
areas to outlying areas in order to break up regions of political 
dissent 
in a statement received in bangkok today sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny compared the resettlement policy to that of 
ousted cambodian leader pol pot 
during pol pots communist khmer rouge government from 
19751978 hundreds of thousands of cambodians died from 
executions famine and civil unrest 
the us state department last week also criticized burmas 
relocations 
saw maung claimed the program was aimed at giving land to 
homeless people who had been living on religious land cemeteries 
and rubbish dumps 
diplomats said it was designed to prevent a repeat of the 
massive antigovernment protests of 1988 which the military 
brutally crushed when it seized power in september that year 
saw maung dismissed as groundless what he said was a march 
10 voice of america report saying the flow of narcotics from burma 
was out of control because of corruption among burmese thai and 
laotian officials 
on monday in bangkok us assistant secretary of state melvin 
levitsky accused the burmese government of colluding with narcotics 
traffickers and doing little to stem a record outflow of heroin 
in his address saw maung also attacked foreign media reports on 
the arrest and suppression of opposition groups 
moynihans statement denounced thailand for profiting from the 
desperation of the burmese regime 
thailand has been one of the few countries to embrace saw 
maungs government it has since secured valuable logging mining 
and fishing concessions

norways seal hunt began this week allowing 
hunters to escape to the relative peace of howling wind and bitter 
cold of an arctic island the real storm is on the mainland 
environmental and animal welfare groups demand an end to the 
heavily subsidized hunt for thousands of adult seals 
photographs of seal pups being beaten to death so their white 
pelts would not be marred by gunshot wounds sparked furious 
international protest and forced norway to ban the hunt for pups 
beginning last year 
seal men complain of hate mail and death threats opponents 
collected 80000 signatures on a petition in sweden this month and 
demonstrators poured bloodred paint outside the norways embassy 
in stockholm 
protesters say the hunt threatens seal stocks a claim disputed 
by the government the hunters claim that unchecked seal 
populations deplete coastal fish stocks also is debated 
norway as a fishing nation must have the right to determine 
how its own ocean resources will be used we cannot allow 
environmental groups to dictate our policy said karsten 
klepsvik of norways fishing ministry 
hunters and those processing the catch will get 14 million in 
state subsidies this year to maintain employment and keep the hunt 
going klepsvik said 
two of norways active sealhunting fleet of four vessels set 
sail on monday for the greenland sea around jan mayen island just 
inside the arctic circle 
animal welfare groups find abhorrent the traditional killing 
method of clubbing or hitting the animals in the head with a sharp 
pick 
there is no rational reason for continuing the hunt the whole 
hunt is an exercise in national chauvinism maintaining tradition 
for traditions sake said paul bugge of greenpeace norway 
sigbjoern espensen 17 was uncomprehending of the hubbub as he 
joined his second hunt i guess im just bitten by the bug he 
told the dagbladet newspaper before sailing north 
veteran arctic skipper paul stark said he also has trouble 
understanding the uproar figuring that sealhunting will die out 
anyway the ships are old and no one is building new ones he 
said 
the hunters have a quota of 34400 adult seals cut by 4100 
from last year prior to 1975 norwegians killed 100000 seals a 
year klepsvik said 
we hope someday this wave of hate will ease and we will be 
able to sell the products again he said 
christian rieber norways last big seal pelt buyer said he 
received 5000 pieces of hate mail on monday alone the total is 
about 100000 post cards so far this year in a campaign he said 
was coordinated in the united states 
one card called rieber the merchant of death another from 
orlando fla ordered him to leave my seals alone a third 
from sweden threatened him with a slow and painful death 
im used to it it follows a pattern said rieber 65 he 
claimed that campaigns start up whenever activists need money 
environmentalists say rieber bears primary blame the blame 
lies where the money is without him the whole seal hunt would 
stop bugge said 
we dont make any money on seals the government pays for 
it said rieber whose family has worked in the seal trade for 
100 years he said bans on importing pelts to many countries left 
his company with 100000 unsold skins in storage

chinas communist party expelled 33400 members 
last year for unhealthy tendencies such as abuse of power or 
ideological shortcomings the official party daily said today 
party inspection offices investigated 197400 cases of 
discipline violations within the party and measures were taken 
against 158800 members the peoples daily said 
the 48millionmember ruling party urged a reappraisal of the 
credentials of all its members following last springs 
prodemocracy movement that gained considerable support from party 
members 
after the movement was crushed in june party leaders said those 
who had failed to pass the ideological tests of the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion would face expulsion or other 
disciplinary action 
however the peoples daily report did not give a breakdown of 
reasons for the expulsions and the number was not noticeably 
higher than in past years 
in 1987 the party expelled 25000 members bringing the total 
number of expulsions between 1982 and 1987 to 177000 no figures 
were available for 1988 
in the past most of those dropped from party ranks were charged 
with economic crimes such as bribery or accused of using their 
party office to obtain lavish banquets good housing or 
preferential treatment for family members

the supreme court today upheld a federal law 
that one state court said makes it too difficult for coal miners 
who contract black lung to get a lawyers help when seeking 
benefits 
the justices unanimously reversed a ruling by west virginias 
highest court that the law and its system for awarding lawyer fees 
in black lung benefits cases violates dueprocess rights 
the evidence relied upon by the west virginia supreme court 
did not remotely establish either that black lung claimants are 
unable to retain qualified counsel or that the cause of such 
inability is the attorneys fees system used by the labor 
department justice antonin scalia wrote for the court 
pneumoconiosis a chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease 
commonly called black lung afflicts numerous coal miners 
under the black lung benefits act congress provides disability 
payments to those miners who are unable to work because of the 
disease 
those who apply for such benefits are entitled to have a 
lawyers help and lawyers who assist miners in obtaining benefits 
have their fees paid by the coal mine operator its insurance 
carrier or the government 
to get such fees paid a lawyer must apply separately to the 
labor department and to the official that presided over the 
application hearing no fees award is made until a miner receives a 
final award of benefits 
west virginia lawyer george r triplett beginning in 1978 
entered into contingentfee agreements to help about 15 miners 
seeking black lung benefits the agreements entitled triplett to 
onefourth of any back benefits collected by the miners 
since the fees triplett collected between 1978 and 1983 were 
never approved by the labor department or any court they were in 
violation of labor department regulations 
the west virginia state bars committee on legal ethics in 1987 
recommended that the states highest court suspend triplett for six 
months for violating the regulations 
the state supreme court of appeals in a 32 decision in 1988 
refused to enforce the suspension 
the state court said the evidence made clear that most lawyers 
are unwilling to represent miners seeking black lung benefits 
because of inadequate fees and the long delays in collecting 
them 
once a miner is awarded benefits the state court said it often 
takes an additional two years for a lawyer to be paid his 
fee there is no provision for interest payments 
the state court ruling did not bar the labor departments own 
enforcement of its attorneyfee regulations but it knocked out the 
primary method of enforcing those regulations in west virginia 
state bar disciplinary hearings 
todays decision said the state court did not have enough solid 
evidence to make its ruling 
as to the unavailability of attorneys the court relied 
upon three lawyers assessments scalia wrote this will not 
do 
he said past high court rulings made clear that this sort of 
anecdotal evidence will not overcome the presumption of regularity 
and constitutionality to which a program established by congress is 
entitled 
scalia also said there was insufficient proof that the asserted 
unavailability of lawyers to handle black lung benefits cases could 
be tied to a fees system 
the case is labor department vs triplett 881671

disagreements over the amounts of food 
going to government and rebelheld territories could delay a 
uncoordinated relief operation to help millions threatened by 
famine 
united nations secretary general javier perez de cuellar in a 
message to a meeting of sudanese government officials and western 
donors monday urged fast action to head off a disaster in southern 
sudan 
christian and animist rebels in the south have waged a 
7yearold war for autonomy from the moslemdominated government in 
khartoum the war created a famine estimated to have killed 300000 
southerners in 1988 
unless immediate and effective action is taken to expedite the 
delivery and distribution of food and other humanitarian supplies 
to the affected civilian populations we may once more be faced 
with a disaster of major proportions perez de cuellar said 
the message was read at the meeting by michael priestly the 
secretarygenerals special representative for emergency and relief 
operations in sudan 
there are still substantial differences on the details of 
relief and rehabilitation allocations and more recently funding 
arrangements which could further delay phase two of operation 
lifeline sudan unless a more pragmatic approach be adopted by all 
concerned perez de cuellar said 
the un work plan says that 45 million southerners need 
emergency relief assistance this summer about 23 million live in 
the wartorn areas in southern sudan 400000 others fled to border 
areas and about 18 million displaced people have gone to khartoum 
operation lifeline sudan a massive international relief effort 
coordinated by the united nations in 1989 is credited with saving 
hundreds of thousands of lives the operation was made possible be 
a de facto ceasefire between the government and the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army 
the relief operation was halted when fighting resumed between 
the two sides late last year about 87000 tons of food and other 
supplies had been sent to famine areas some 18000 tons short of 
the targeted amount 
the united nations had hoped to start ferrying 104000 tons of 
fresh relief supplies to the south by the beginning of next month 
but last week the rebels claimed the relief program was biased in 
favor of the government they hinted they might block it unless the 
united nations decides to send more food to rebelheld areas

the united states wants the soviet 
union and all other participants of a 35nation economic conference 
to sign a declaration committing themselves to westernstyle 
freemarket principles us officials said today 
a soviet official at the meeting welcomed the idea of 
establishing guidelines for expansion of eastwest economic 
cooperation but expressed reservations about the us proposal 
alan f holmer a former us deputy trade representative who 
heads the us delegation said the united states wants to help lay 
the groundwork for increased eastwest economic activity 
once you get the economic principles established in the east 
bloc the commercial relationships will flow relatively 
automatically but without the right principles you wont have the 
commercial relationships holmer said 
john evans the no 2 us delegate at the conference in the 
west german capital rejected any suggestion washington was trying 
to set conditions for steppedup us economic involvement with the 
east bloc 
but like holmer he made it clear freemarket principles would 
foster greater economic links between the wealthy west and 
reforming east bloc countries 
we should face up to the fact that market economies are what 
work evans said 
the united states is asking the 35nation conference on economic 
cooperation in europe to adopt what the us delegates have called 
the bonn principles for economic cooperation 
among other things the document says the 35 nations recognize 
the importance of international policies which support the 
expansion of free open trade investment and capital flows and 
full recognition and protection of rights of citizens to hold and 
use private property 
a highranking soviet official at the conference sergei zotov 
said he supports the us idea of setting out principles for 
eastwest economic cooperation 
he also said the us initiative could become a positive 
contribution toward broadening eastwest economic links 
but he said the us document presents more a code of 
behavior for east bloc countries rather than concerning itself 
with purely principles of economic cooperation 
zotov is deputy head of the soviet foreign ministrys department 
of security and cooperation in europe 
zotov also said he doubts whether there is enough time for the 
35nation conference to thoroughly discuss the us proposal and 
act on it 
the meeting of government officials and business executives 
began on march 20 and runs through april 11 the 35nation group 
includes the united states canada and all eastern and western 
european nations except albania

the supreme court today gave states new power 
to limit political campaign spending by corporations upholding a 
michigan law challenged by that states chamber of commerce 
voting 63 the justices said such restrictions are justified by 
the states interest in preventing corruption or even its 
appearance 
the court rejected arguments that the michigan law violates free 
speech rights of chamber of commerce members 
supporters of the state law said it is intended to prevent 
corporate giants such as the major automobile manufacturers from 
funneling millions of dollars through the chamber to favorite 
candidates without revealing the spending 
corporate wealth can unfairly influence elections when it is 
deployed in the form of independent expenditures justice 
thurgood marshall said for the court 
we therefore hold that the state has articulated a 
sufficiently compelling rationale to support its restriction on 
independent expenditures by corporations he said 
marshall also rejected arguments that the law is 
unconstitutional because it exempts labor unions and media 
corporations 
he noted that union members who disagree with a unions 
political activities can decline to contribute to them without 
giving up their membership 
media corporations merit exemption to protect the role of 
broadcasters and publishers in reporting and commenting on 
newsworthy events marshall added 
in a dissenting opinion justice antonin scalia said the 
court today endorses the principle that too much speech is an evil 
that the democratic majority can proscribe the principle is 
incompatible with the absolutely central truth of the first 
amendment that government cannot be trusted to assure through 
censorship the fairness of political debate 
justices anthony m kennedy and sandra day oconnor also 
dissented 
the ruling is a victory for the federal election commission 
which supported an appeal by michigan officials 
the michigan chamber of commerce has some 8000 duespaying 
members about threefourths of them corporations 
the chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the 
grand rapids press in support of richard bandstra a republican 
candidate for the state house of representatives 
fearing the ad would be considered illegal under michigans 
campaign finance act the business group filed a federal suit 
seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional as applied to the 
chamber 
the law generally prohibits corporations from spending in behalf 
of political candidates and carries a maximum 10000 fine 
the act permits a corporation to make such expenditures if it 
sets up a special fund or political action committee that is 
required to keep records and disclose the name of contributors 
the chamber has such a fund but it wanted to pay for the 
newspaper ad for bandstra out of its general treasury which is 
exempt from the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the 
campaign finance law 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals exempted the chamber of 
commerce from the law 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 supreme court ruling 
limiting the federal governments power to regulate corporate 
political spending 
the justices said then that the federal election campaign act of 
1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed 
primarily to influence public opinion and not to make a profit 
the high court in 1986 ruled in favor of a massachusetts 
prolife group formed to protest the legalization of abortion 
but today the justices drew key distinctions between the 
massachusetts group and the chamber of commerce 
marshall said the prolife organizations narrow focus ensured

serbian police today began purging 
kosovos police force of ethnic albanians who stand accused of 
inaction during ethnic unrest in the troubled province 
serbian police who control the security force of kosovo 
province intend to purge 70 percent of ethnic albanians from 
police ranks and 100 already have been fired according to news 
reports in belgrade the yugoslav capital 
serbian authorities were also demanding the resignation of jusuf 
karakushi kosovos ethnic albanian police chief the reports said 
kosovo is one of two provinces of serbia the largest of the 
yugoslav republics ethnic albanians represent 90 percent of 
kosovos 19 million population and have pressed for greater 
autonomy 
but a year ago the federal government approved constitutional 
changes that gave serbia almost complete control over kosovo 
claiming the serbian minority was being harassed by ethnic 
albanians 
meanwhile security forces in kosovo braced for unrest expected 
wednesday the first anniversary of the amendments the date was 
recently proclaimed a national holiday in serbia 
the proclamation of march 28 as a serbian national holiday 
represents a provocation whose aim is to further escalate political 
conflicts in kosovo and yugoslavia read a statement from the 
democratic union the largest independent ethnic albanian party in 
kosovo 
in serbia where the communist leadership is determined to 
crush at all cost the ethnic albanian drive for autonomy the 
holiday will be marked with public festivities news reports said 
more than 60 people mostly ethnic albanians have died in 
ethnic violence in kosovo in the past year 
members of an international human rights commission touring 
kosovo said the human rights situation in the province was 
poor they said yugoslavia which seeks full membership in the 
council of europe may have trouble joining the organization 
because of rights violations in the province 
a yugoslav parliamentary commission said monday nearly 2990 
ethnic albanians were hospitalized in kosovo since saturday 
complaining of lung and skin problems allegedly caused by a 
mysterious poisoning 
ethnic albanians claimed the mysterious illness was caused by 
serbs while serbs blamed ethnic albanians for the poisoning scare 
allegedly intended to trigger massive uprisings in kosovo 
no traces of any poisoning were found in any blood or urine 
samples and all albanians had been released from hospital by late 
monday the commission said 
kosovo which borders albania was a part of ancient serbia 
most of the christian serbs in the province view the moslem 
albanians as intruders and allege serbs in kosovo are harassed by 
the albanians 
yugoslavia which broke from the soviet bloc in 1948 is 
governed by an eightman presidency made up of representatives 
from the countrys six republics and two provinces

an east german church leader today appealed 
for an international commission to probe allegations linking new 
lawmakers to the ousted communist regimes secret police 
the allegations which involve some leaders of the noncommunist 
political parties and the likely new premier are stalling efforts 
to form a government following the countrys first free election on 
march 18 
manfred stolpe the chief administrator of east berlins 
lutheran church recommended that former swiss president and 
justice minister kurt furgler head the commission 
in an interview with the west german newspaper die welt 
newspaper stolpe said the international commission should take up 
its work after the new east german parliament is officially 
constituted to prevent any further delays in setting up the 
countrys new government 
an alliance of leftist parties urged a full investigation be 
conducted before the legislature holds its first sitting 
the alliance includes new forum the prodemocracy group that 
led last falls peaceful revolution but did poorly in the election 
the christian democratic union which won the election and has 
rejected such a probe before the parliaments first session said 
it hopes the new lawmaking body will be able to convene next 
tuesday 
lothar de maiziere the christian democratic chief who is the 
partys candidate for premier has said he hopes to form a new 
government before midapril 
de maiziere has been implicated in the secret police allegations 
but has strongly denied ever working for the secret police 
ibrahim boehme whose leftist social democratic party came in a 
distant second in the balloting also denied similar charges 
against himself but on monday temporarily stepped aside as party 
leader until the allegations have been cleared up by an independent 
commission 
de maiziere said monday he believed he could form his government 
within two weeks 
he has offered to form a broad coalition with the social 
democrats now led by boehmes deputy markus meckel to gain a 
twothirds majority needed in the newly elected 400member 
parliament for a decision on rapid unification with west germany 
the 85000srong secret police and its 109000 informers were 
used to suppress dissent and keep tight control on east germans 
before ousted communist leader erich honecker resigned last fall 
under popular pressure for democratic reforms 
officials have said dismantling of the force known as the 
stasi has been virtually completed but many east germans believe 
the secret police are still trying to disrupt the democratic 
process

the senate today refused to put aside an 
industrysought change in clean air legislation that would give 
companies more flexibility in meeting permit requirements under the 
new law 
environmentalists have opposed the change arguing that it 
creates loopholes that will allow businesses to avoid compliance 
with some pollution controls and inhibit federal enforcement of the 
law 
the senate voted 5047 against killing the amendment and 
opponents immediately asked that the measure be considered again 
later hoping some senators will change their votes and others who 
did not vote would oppose the measure 
sen don nickels rokla had argued that the permit and 
enforcement requirements of the bill would spell economic 
disasters for thousands of businesses and result in a 
bureaucratic nightmare unless they are streamlined 
but critics of the amendment said the changes envisioned by 
nickels would allow polluters in some cases to obtain permits that 
would allow them to escape some provisions of the new law it also 
would allow some polluters to tie cases up in lengthy litigation 
and inhibit citizen lawsuits seeking enforcement of pollution 
controls opponents of the proposed change said 
the clean air legislation which imposes a wide range of 
emission controls on industry imposes for the first time a federal 
requirement that companies obtain operating permits to ensure 
compliance with pollution control requirements 
about 35 states already have laws requiring such permits under 
the bill the epa would have the authority to review the state and 
local permits to ensure that they comply with federal pollution 
control requirements 
the senate was expected to continue consideration of a wide 
range of amendments to the compromise clean air bill on the floor 
several issues remained unresolved including whether to provide 
financial assistance to coal miners who lose their jobs because of 
tighter pollution controls on coalpowered electric utilities 
the nickels amendment was supported by the bush administration 
although permitting and enforcement provisions of the bill were not 
included in the closeddoor negotitiations that led to the 
compromise clean air bill now before the senate 
senate leaders and sponsors of the compromise bill therefore 
are free to oppose the proposal 
among the industry groups that have lobbied vigorously for 
easing the permitting requirements were the national association of 
manufacturers the chemical manufacturers association the clean 
air working group an industry umbrella group and the national 
environmental development association

officials in chicago and elizabeth nj ordered a crackdown on 
illegal social clubs to prevent a disastrous fire like the one that 
killed 87 people in new york but few other cities consider such 
clubs to be a problem 
when a tragedy like this occurs you dont want to ignore 
it daniel weil chicagos building commissioner said monday 
at least 100 nonprofit social clubs in chicago that are 
registered with the secretary of state will be inspected for 
hazardous materials and adequate safety systems weil said 
city officials said they also are trying to locate any 
unlicensed centers that would be more likely to have code 
violations that could lead to a tragedy like the one early sunday 
in new york 
in elizabeth mayor thomas g dunn said city inspectors would 
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business in light of 
new attention drawn by the happy land social club in the bronx 
two owners of one club were arrested monday and about 100 
patrons chased from the place he said 
in paterson nj vice squad sgt michael recca said three or 
four such establishments have been shut down in the last month 
generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage 
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between 
patrons he said 
most cities have stiff laws prohibiting selling liquor without a 
license 
if you operate in texas without a license you get put in 
jail said ep mccracken regional supervisor of the texas 
alcoholic beverage commission in dallas we dont run our 
business in texas like they do in new york 
new york officials say there are literally hundreds of clubs 
like happy land a firetrap that attracted a largely poor 
immigrant hispanic crowd 
the fire allegedly set by the former boyfriend of a club 
employee prompted a new round of promises by city officials to 
crack down on clubs that offer dancing and drinking to the citys 
poor 
illegal clubs have been a nagging headache to fire building and 
liquor officials in los angeles omaha neb gary and east 
chicago ill and lawrence mass 
we arrest them on misdemeanor charges and they can open up 
again in a week omaha police lt john beers said 
omaha police found a locked front door and about 220 people in 
two small rooms when they raided the dirty dozen motorcycle club 
sunday if there had been a rush to get out those people would 
have been trampled beers said 
in lawrence mass outside boston there may be three or four 
illegal clubs operating fire chief raymond johnson estimated 
we shut them down and two weeks later they open someplace 
else johnson said i guess its a very lucrative business 
in los angeles a prominent club owner said aggressive 
crackdowns on unsafe or illegal nightclubs have failed to stop chic 
underground clubs from flourishing and evading detection by fire 
officials 
i myself go to these places said steve banerjee who owns 
legal chippendales clubs on both coasts its the whole theory of 
do something you shouldnt do you think you are part of the in 
crowd the aware crowd many bigcity officials say they seldom 
or never see such establishments 
thats bootlegging in texas and we would shut them down 
said randy yarbrough assistant administrator for the texas 
alcoholic beverage commission officials in boston detroit san 
francisco and orange county calif were among those saying they 
didnt believe their cities had a problem with illegal clubs 
some officials hoped news of the happy land disaster could boost 
support for inspection efforts for legal and illegal clubs alike 
said lawrence fire chief johnson now they will use this as an 
example

prosecutors are investigating whether owners in 
a corporate chain that includes the husband of actress kathleen 
turner may share responsibility in the fire deaths of 87 people in 
an illegal nightclub 
the cuban immigrant accused of torching the club to avenge a 
romantic snub was under a suicide watch in a psychiatric ward today 
after allegedly telling police he set the blaze because the devil 
got into me 
julio gonzalez 36 was charged with murdering 87 people by 
setting fire sunday to the jammed happy land social club in the 
bronx 
miss turners husband jay weiss acknowledged through a 
statement by his lawyer that he and a partner are principals of 
little peach inc which leased the club site in 1985 from a 
corporation controlled by real estate developer alex dilorenzo iii 
two years later little peach sublet the twostory building to elias 
colon who operated the happy land club 
colon died in the fire 
the statement by the lawyer roger boyle said weiss company 
has been actively pressing eviction proceedings against mr colon 
and had hoped that a final eviction would have resulted from a 
trial scheduled for wednesday of this week 
the statement said weiss and his partner morris jaffe are 
horrified at the events of this weekend and lament the loss of life 
which ensued 
bronx district attorney robert johnson has said he has 10 
assistants working on prosecuting gonzalez and also working on 
the investigation of whether or not there is any possible 
responsibility criminal liability on the part of the club andor 
the owner of the building 
across from the fireblackened club in an impoverished 
neighborhood near the bronx zoo families on monday drifted in and 
out of public school 67 where agencies helped arrange funerals and 
offered counseling and financial aid 
anger was directed at gonzalez former girlfriend lydia 
feliciano when she appeared at the school to inquire about aid for 
friends 
i cant believe she is here how could she show her face 
said edgardo rodriguez 22 who lost four friends and was awaiting 
information on financial aid to send their bodies home to honduras 
when asked why she came to the school ms feliciano responded 
i lost people too i lost friends as a crowd gathered around 
her two police officers escorted ms feliciano out of a back 
entrance of the school 
a huge wooden cross stood in front of the nightclubs ruins as 
neighbors prayed at an outdoor service conducted in english and 
spanish the service monday ended with the singing of de 
colores a song about brotherly love 
at the direction of mayor david dinkins authorities visited 241 
clubs citywide from midnight to 7 am monday and posted orders on 
187 of them to vacate 
police issued 52 safety violations and 30 summonses said sgt 
dick vreeland 
police said gonzalez had vowed to shut this place down after 
an argument with ms feliciano a happy land employee who had split 
with the unemployed gonzalez several months ago 
i got angry the devil got into me and i set the place on 
fire gonzalez told authorities according to a police source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
gonzalez was arraigned on 87 counts of murder committed in the 
course of arson 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to 
human life one count of attempted murder and two counts of arson 
he entered no plea 
johnson the bronx district attorney said he hoped gonzalez 
would get consecutive sentences amounting to 2000 years in prison 
if convicted 
gonzalez who was jailed for army desertion in cuba in the 
1970s came to the united states from cuba on the 1980 mariel 
boatlift he told immigration officials he had portrayed himself as 
a drug trafficker to get kicked out of cuba the new york times 
reported 
the victims of sundays fire many of them honduran immigrants 
suffocated burned or were trampled to death they had to choose 
between a wall of fire or retreating and dying of asphyxiation 
johnson said 
police believe five people escaped three patrons ms 
feliciano and the club disc jockey ruben valladares 
valladares was listed in critical but stable condition today at 
jacobi hospital with burns over 30 percent of his body ms 
feliciano and the others escaped serious injury ms feliciano is 
in protective custody 
johnson said gonzalez had described the following sequence 
after arguing with ms feliciano with whom he sought to resume 
a relationship he was ejected from the club 
he bought 1 worth of gasoline at a nearby station returned and 
faked making a telephone call when he saw someone when that person 
left he poured gasoline between the street and an inside door and 
ignited it 
gonzalez watched it burn for awhile making statements to at 
least two witnesses about his role in the fire then he went home 
where police found him a few hours later his shoes reeking of 
gasoline he made a videotaped admission to police 
johnson said gonzalez knew the twostory club lacked windows 
rear exits and adequate staircases he also knew how crowded it was 
he is a double animal said rene j mena whose son rene 
jr 30 died in the fire here theyre going to have good food 
for him a book a movie in central america we dont do it that 
way 
a vacate order was issued in 1988 against the club and again a 
year later because happy land lacked a proper sprinkler system 
exits emergency lighting and signs it also had no liquor or 
cabaret license dinkins said 
dinkins discussed sundays tragedy while addressing garment 
workers monday commemorating new york citys triangle shirtwaist 
co fire which occurred exactly 79 years before the happy land 
blaze the 1911 tragedy claimed 146 lives and transformed workplace 
safety laws around the country 
the sight of those bodies lined along the walls like so many 
wax figures and the realization of the panic and the pain they 
must have suffered in their last moments will remain with me for 
the rest of my life dinkins said

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk today accused vietnam of seizing control of two of his 
countrys provinces and annexing several islands 
the most serious threat to the survival of cambodia is the 
modification by vietnam of the frontiers of cambodia sihanouk 
told a news conference 
he claimed vietnam redrew the two countries shared border 
invaded the provinces of ratanakiri and mondulkiri and annexed 
several offshore islands with the consent of the hanoibacked 
cambodian government led by hun sen he did not elaborate 
there was no immediate comment from the vietnamese government 
he also reiterated charges that vietnamese soldiers remain in 
cambodia despite hanois muchpublicized troop pullout last fall 
he said 1 million vietnamese settlers are in the country in some 
places making the cambodians an ethnic minority 
many of the vietnamese settlers moved to cambodia to escape 
fighting during the vietnam war 
sihanouk who resigned earlier this year as president of the 
threeparty resistance coalition said general elections were 
impossible until the vietnamese settlers were removed 
hun sens government gave them citizenship but thats not 
acceptable to us hun sens decisions are illegal he said 
sihanouk also repeated denials of cooperating with the communist 
khmer rouge faction in the coalition 
hundreds of thousands of people died during agrarian reform and 
resettlement imposed by the khmer rouge when it ruled before 
vietnams invasion in late 1978 and there is concern that the 
group would regain power if the hun sen government is dismantled 
i am not prokhmer rouge i am not red not even pink 
sihanouk said 
he said his forces and the khmer rouge occupy neighboring 
territories in cambodia and when we attack the same enemy a 
common enemy how can we avoid seeing each other 
sihanouk in late february returned to cambodia after an 11year 
exile at the news conference in his beijing residence he handed 
out a glossy brochure showing his quarters in one of cambodias 
liberated zones 
he returned to beijing this month because his motherinlaw has 
been hospitalized in the chinese capital and is said to be near

berlins roman catholic bishop today urged 
east germans to treat ousted and ailing communist leader erich 
honecker with humaneness

chance to live out his life in peace no matter what he has done 
bishop georg sterzinski told the associated press 
honecker 77 has been living at a parish home outside east 
berlin since january after being kicked out of an exclusive wooded 
compound previously reserved for top communist officials 
the compound was closed after a peaceful popular revolt swept 
honecker and his hardline communist government from power in the 
fall it is now being used as a home for the mentally retarded 
honecker ruled east germany with an iron fist for 18 years until 
his ouster in october 
he is reported to be in poor health he was arrested in january 
after leaving a hospital following surgery for kidney cancer but 
was released a day later because of his ailing condition he and 
his wife have been living in virtual exile at the church refuge

to move honecker and his wife to a more comfortable residence 80 
miles from berlin was thwarted by an angry mob

night dozens of people banged the roof of their car with their 
fists and made obscene gestures as the honeckers were driven away 
honeckers wife margot is a former education minister 
sterzinski said east german citizens should try to prevent 
their hate from running freely 
he said honecker should be given better accommodation and should 
not have to live in constant fear of being thrown out

the bishop said 
on monday east germanys chief prosecutor said there were no 
legal grounds to prosecute honecker for high treason but he 
remains under investigation for massive corruption and abuse of 
power

a usfinanced television operation began 
transmitting signals to cuba early today but cuban officials 
blocked the transmission after 38 minutes and accused the united 
states of engaging in aggressive activity 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed the debut of tv 
marti and said the administration planned to continue efforts to 
transmit news and entertainment programs programs to cuba despite 
the successful jamming effort 
we just hope that at some point they see the light 
fitzwater said alluding to cuban officials he said the operation 
was consistent with national and international law 
the tv test operation began at 130 am est and was clearly 
visible on channel 13 in the havana area until the jamming began at 
208 said a voice of america official who asked not to be 
identified by name 
the cuban government news agency prensa latina said in a 
dispatch monitored in mexico city that the debut was nothing 
impressive since in a 10minute interval the principal 
technological power on the planet could not keep the invading 
signal from being rejected over the coverage area 
cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these 
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and washington may 
be looking for a pretext to unleash military aggression the 
dispatch said 
the cuban government the agency said has placed 
responsibility on the government of that country for all the 
consequences of this action which is aggressive and violates its 
sovereignty 
official cuban statements have said retaliatory measures besides 
jamming would be taken but none was announced immediately the voa 
source said 
the station is designed to be a tv version of radio marti which 
has provided news and entertainment to cuban listeners since 1985 
radio marti was not jammed this morning 
cuban officials in addition to jamming channel 13 also blocked 
the signals on several other channels the voa source said 
he said that at 345 am est tv marti switched from the test 
pattern to baseball highlights and musical programming but these 
signals were jammed as well 
the signal was sent from a transmitter placed aboard a balloon 
dangling 10000 feet above cudjoe key off the south florida coast 
technical problems have delayed testing for months 
after the testing the administration is supposed to make a 
legal and technical evaluation of the operation within three 
months according to the legislation 
if the operation proves feasible on both counts formal 
programming can begin for a twoyear period the funds already have 
been appropriated 
but if the testing interferes with florida stations or violates 
aspects of international law governing such broadcasts the 
operation will be scrapped the administration has promised to stay 
within the law 
president fidel castro has reacted sharply to tv marti 
americans he said recently are not even capable of knowing how 
much they offend the hearts and sentiments of our people 
they know it violates international law they know it violates 
national sovereignty he said 
tv martis sponsors maintain it is an effective way to bring 
objective information to the cuban people via television they say 
that cubans have been fed only propaganda for all 31 years of the 
revolution 
cuban officials have said a range of options are being 
considered in retaliation for tv marti 
among others they said that telephone communications and travel 
between the two countries might be suspended 
another possibility is that cuba will activate transmitters 
capable of blocking us radio broadcasts over a huge area west of 
the mississippi

preliminary discussions with mexico on the feasibility of a 
usmexican freetrade pact 
president bush proposed such an agreement during his 1988 
presidential campaign saying trade barriers should be dropped

a freetrade agreement took effect between the united states and

as abuse of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to 
cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment the letter 
said 
we are particularly concerned that this case will create a 
precedent for other states in the united states which are not 
currently carrying out execution the letter said 
we will continue campaigning until harris is either executed 
or the death penalty rescinded said amnesty international

about half a billion people worldwide are 
suffering from tropical diseases such as malaria river blindness 
and sleeping sickness the world health organization said wednesday 
as it launched a campaign to fight the illnesses 
who officials appealed for more funds to pay for research and 
control programs for the great neglected diseases it said they 
pose a risk of infection to the entire population of the african 
continent and much of asia and south america 
the un agencys new campaign will focus attention on the seven 
most widespread tropical diseases which can cause internal organ 
damage limb deformities blindness brain damage and death 
dr shaik khader noordeen a senior official in whos tropical 
diseases division told a news conference that lack of money 
prevented effective use of preventive measures and drugs to counter 
the diseases 
a lot can be done today but it is not being done simply 
because the resources are not available in the endemic countries 
and the awareness is not present in the countries that could help 
them he said 
dr alvaro moncayo another who expert said the organizations 
current research budget into tropical diseases was 6570 million 
spread over a twoyear period 
whos 1990 budget for its program on aids totals 109 million 
these diseases affect the poorest of the poor moncaya said 
when asked why he thought tropical diseases had not received the 
same attention as aids 
a who report said most victims of tropical diseases live in 
countries with average per capita incomes of less than 400 and 
where governments spend a yearly average of just 4 per person on 
health care 
the 26page report said malaria claimed the highest number of 
victims it estimated that 270 million people carry the parasite 
spread by infected mosquitos with 110 million new cases each year 
it put the annual number of fatalities at 1 million to 2 million 
the report said 21 billion people live in areas of the third 
world where they are at risk the parasite is showing increasing 
resistance to common drugs it said 
schistosomiasis a disease caused by waterborne parasites from 
snails afflicted about 200 million people destroying internal 
tissues and contributing to malnutrition according to the report 
more than 110 million people suffer from filariasis caused by 
mosquitos and blackflies it leads to river blindness or 
onchocerciasis a disease transmitted by flies that causes tumors 
skin lesions and blindness filariasis may also lead to a painful 
swelling of the limbs known as elephantiasis it said 
who also singled out for concern chagas disease found in 
central and south america and occasionally in the united states it 
said there were 1618 million cases of the disease caused by a 
parasite transmitted by a bloodsucking bug that lives in crevices 
of poorquality houses 
in later stages of the disease the parasites invade body organs 
and eventually cause irreversible damage to the heart and 
intestines the disease is said to be incurable but can be 
prevented by insecticides better housing and health education 
a fifth disease sleeping sickness is transmitted by the bite 
of the tsetse fly in several parts of africa the report said early 
diagnosis was difficult and for the 25000 people who contract the 
disease each year it was invariably fatal 
it said insecticide spraying and tsetse traps had proved 
successful as preventive measures 
it estimated that 12 million people were infected with 
leishmaniasis caused by a sandfly bite some 400000 new cases 
occur each year with victims suffering ailments ranging from 
ulcers to chronic tissue destruction 
in a glimmer of hope in the otherwise gloomy report who said 
leprosy had recently become controllable by treatment involving 
three drugs by the end of last year 175 million of the 4 million 
registered patients had received the therapy 
who estimates there are 1012 million cases of leprosy worldwide

amnesty international on wednesday urged argentina 
to investigate allegations of torture disappearances and killings 
of members of an opposition group who attacked an army barracks 
last year 
the human rights organization published a report detailing 
violations against members of the small leftist movement for the 
fatherland which tried to take over an army base on the outskirts 
of buenos aires 
twentyeight attackers and 11 soldiers and police officers died 
in the jan 23 1989 attack on la tablada base sixty law officers 
were wounded and 13 attackers were arrested 
amnesty urged argentinas president carlos menem to order an 
inquiry in its 21page report the group said there appears to 
be strong evidence that two attackers listed as being killed in 
combat were summarily executed after surrendering 
the report also said three others disappeared after being 
captured and that there was medical evidence to support prisoners 
allegations they were tortured while in official custody 
amnesty international said argentinas attorney general promised 
prompt investigations into these complaints last april by the end 
of the year the investigating magistrate had reached a decision in 
only one case 
amnesty internationals report also said some investigations 
were flawed it cited autopsy procedures which it said were not of 
a high enough standard to determine whether deaths had occurred in 
combat or were the result of executions 
the report alleged that security forces raided private homes 
often without warrants following the attack on the base it said 
they threatened and in some cases tortured suspected sympathizers 
armed plainclothes officers reportedly stormed one home without 
formally identifying themselves or producing a warrant tortured 
the couple raped the wife and threatened to kill their 
11monthold child the document alleged 
four women and 16 men including a roman catholic priest were 
convicted in october of planning or carrying out the attack on the 
military base and given sentences ranging from 10 years to life in 
prison 
the attackers said they believed a military coup was imminent 
and that it was being coordinated at the barracks by rebel officers

mongolias oncepowerful buddhist 
monks nearly wiped out during seven decades of communist rule are 
cautiously joining the new prodemocracy movement in hopes of 
winning freedom from state control 
when crowds first began rallying in december to demand free 
elections and other reforms only one young monk baasan dared 
join in 
but buoyed by the successes of the activists in winning the 
ouster of top communist officials mongolias only surviving 
monastery has ventured into politics for the first time since the 
days of bogd a ranking monk who was king from 1911 to 1915 
gandan monasterys agenda is short it wants abolition of the 
state committee on religion which regulates religious activities 
and freedom to open more temples and monasteries 
we would like to expand our religious activity train more 
monks and publish sutras or scriptures said gaandan the 
monasterys hamba lama or leading monk 
mongols like tibetans believe in lamaist buddhism a mix of 
buddhism and tantric ritual monks are called lamas 
gaandan said he believes lamas can be forces for good in 
mongolian politics but he has no dreams of a return to the 
precommunist days when mongolias more than 700 monasteries and 
temples wielded great power and absorbed half the male population 
as lamas 
there may be several hundred monasteries in a few years if 
controls are lifted he said but not 700 quality is more 
important than quantity 
the monasteries were closed in the late 1930s reportedly at the 
urging of soviet leader josef stalin and on the pretext that they 
harbored japanese spies and weapons 
their priceless gold and silver statues were sold shipped to 
the soviet union or destroyed their lands were nationalized and 
monks were forced to find secular work about 14000 monks were 
killed according to official figures 
government propaganda denounced the lamas as exploiters a 
poster still hanging in the state central museum shows a lama with 
his mouth opened wide swallowing up herds and people 
in 1944 the government allowed gandan in ulan bator to reopen 
but barred its monks from preaching outside monastery grounds it 
now has about 160 lamas gaandan said the government plans to 
reopen two more monasteries this year 
on march 11 several thousand buddhist believers lamas and 
members of the leading opposition group the mongolian democratic 
association held a rally at a former temple in ulan bator that has 
been turned into a museum and demanded it be reopened for worship 
they announced the formation of a nonofficial union of 
mongolian believers to promote religious interests the first 
independent religious group in mongolia in decades 
when several dozen prodemocracy activists held a twoday hunger 
strike for democratic reform in midmarch lamas came to pray for 
them baasan said he played an increasingly prominent role in 
protests organized by the democratic association 
last week gandan monastery sent a letter to the great peoples 
hural or legislature asking it to disband the committee on 
religion 
the hamba lamas aide dorjgotov said leaders from the 
democracy movement and the government have begun coming frequently 
to talk with gaandan in the evenings they dont come officially 
but as human beings he said 
the hamba lama said he is open to both 
according to buddhism everybody must be under compassion 
he said so our attitude will be the same to the current 
communist party and to the democratic forces 
so far no one seems worried about such issues as separation of 
religion and politics or whether the lamas could someday regain 
political power 
its impossible said 
ulankhu a member of the opposition social democrats said that 
would be impossible because the communists completely destroyed 
the system there are so few monks 
their influence over mongolias 2 million people also is in 
doubt dorjgotov insisted that most mongolians remain buddhist 
despite the atheist education system 
many youths in ulan bator say they do not believe although they 
have been culturally influenced by buddhism some support its 
revival as a moralizing force especially regarding protection of 
nature which buddhists revere 
buddhism also has appeal as part of mongolias national 
heritage which only recently could be celebrated after decades of 
emphasizing socialist internationalism 
an entire world is behind that word lamaism our ancient 
philosophy mathematics linguistics pharmacology our whole 
culture said dr g boshigt a physician and leading member of 
the democratic association 
even if the lamas dont make political demands they will 
represent a political force

year that ended last september 30 an official told congress on 
tuesday 
princeton n lyman head of the state departments bureau for 
refugee programs said bush and congress will consult later this 
year to set the level 
however for budget purposes he said his office had asked 
congress to provide money for 110000 admissions 40000 of them 
from the soviet union and 5500 from eastern europe 
the request also provides for another 29000 immigrants from 
vietnam 23000 from countries in east asia such as thailand which 
has given refugees emergency asylum 6000 from the near east and 
south asia 3500 from the western hemisphere and 3000 from africa 
he added that the administration puts high priority on getting 
congress to pass a special bill to accommodate more soviets 
we want to be able to expand opportunities for soviet refugees 
to come to the us as our fair share of the number pressing to 
leave there he said 
he agreed with a private refugee support organization that more 
should be done by the united states and other countries to help 
refugees throughout the world lyman said there are 15 million 
refugees worldwide up from 126 million in 1988 
roger p winter director of the unofficial us committee for 
refugees complained of reduced government spending in 1985 the

lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis today accused moscow of inexcusable aggression and 
demanded that it return at least 23 lithuanian army deserters who 
were beaten and dragged from hospitals 
the government of lithuania demands the return of its 
kidnapped citizens landsbergis said in a letter to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev he also urged negotiations with 
moscow in neutral territory 
the letters angry tone and the soviet armys decision to round 
up the deserters marked a new more volatile stage in the open 
confrontation between lithuania and moscow which began march 11 
with the republics declaration of independence the beatings 
reported during the roundup of lithuanian deserters were the first 
violent action by moscow since the declaration 
soviet soldiers raided two hospitals where the lithuanian 
deserters had sought refuge and witnesses said some deserters were 
beaten as they were taken from a decaying psychiatric hospital in 
vilnius a trail of blood led down the steps and out the front door 
of the hospital 
they beat them with their fists said a duty nurse at a 
psychiatric hospital where windows and iron beds were broken in the 
predawn raid 
landsbergis said he feared it could presage a fullscale 
crackdown on his baltic republic 
it is obvious that the soviet armed forces have been given 
permission to use violence landsbergis said 
the soviet union today also ordered all foreigners to leave 
lithuania foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said in 
moscow last week diplomats and foreign journalists were told they 
could not travel to the republic 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to 
criticize moscow for todays actions saying we do not want to 
inflame the situation president bush has urged gorbachev not to 
use force against lithuanians 
at a news conference at the soviet embassy in washington deputy 
ambassador sergei chetverikov said the soviet union would continue 
to try to find peaceful solutions to the unrest in lithuania 
but said certain steps by troops were necessary to protect law and 
order and soviet installations 
about 4000 opponents of lithuanias independence drive attended 
a vilnius rally today that landsbergis had warned might turn 
violent and serve as moscows excuse to intervene 
a soviet military helicopter dropped leaflets on monday urging 
people to attend todays rally 
the rally lasted less than an hour and remained peaceful 
protesters did not even trespass on the grass in the middle of the 
square near the parliament building inside parliament officials 
convinced the crowd might try to storm the building had rolled out 
fire hoses to repel attackers 
in all the official soviet news agency tass said troops seized 
23 deserters in two hospitals 
rita dapkus spokeswoman for the lithuanian bureau of 
information said soviet troops beat 12 lithuanian deserters and 
the militiamen who came to defend them at the psychiatric 
hospital before taking the deserters away she said the 26 others 
at the hospital escaped 
there were no reports on the extent of injuries lithuanians 
have fled the red army complaining of beatings and other abuse 
since their republic took moves to leave the soviet union 
soviet troops also took over the republics showcase communist 
party headquarters today making it the fifth party building to be 
seized since sunday in moscows bid to assert sovereignty in the 
republic 
speaking to reporters today landsbergis denounced the open 
acts of aggression and accused soviet authorities of fabricating 
stories of provocation to justify the use of force 
lithuanias communists broke with moscow in december but a 
prosoviet minority in the party has tried to rally against the 
proindependence majority 
until the weekend moscow had tried to intimidate the 
lithuanians with nonviolent tactics the kremlin paraded tanks 
through the capital and ordered lithuanians to surrender firearms 
and not to attempt a takeover of sovietcontrolled enterprises 
the lithuanians did not budge and soviet troops began seizing 
communist party buildings in official media the kremlin portrayed 
the small peaceful republic as in a state of anarchy and accused 
its leaders of planning to jail opponents of independence 
tensions seemed to ease with the opening of negotiations between 
soviet military representatives and lithuanian leaders on sunday 
but army helicopters later dropped leaflets inviting people to a 
rally today to protest the abyss of independence the move 
clearly was aimed at playing on the fears of russian and polish 
minorities who comprise 20 percent of the states 38 million 
people 
in kaunas 65 miles west soviet soldiers seized another 
hospital serving as sanctuary a police officer said the officer 
who did not identify himself said two young men were arrested and 
troops were not allowing local police onto hospital grounds 
moscow had warned that lithuanian soldiers not returning to 
barracks by last saturday would be arrested lithuania contends the 
youths were illegally drafted into an army of occupation 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania in 1940 along with 
the two other baltic republics of estonia and latvia where 
proindependence movements are also strong but more cautiously 
working toward a break with moscow 
a lithuanian interior ministry official and a lithuanian 
journalist both said on condition of anonymity that two lithuanian 
police officers were beaten by the soldiers when they tried to 
intervene 
an abc television crew arriving at the scene was held at 
gunpoint and forced to surrender all its videotape 
gen valentin varennikov commander of soviet land forces was 
quoted by tass as saying the arrests were necessary because 
deserters who have become militants in the sajudis nationalist 
organization were undergoing special training in one of the 
buildings of the hospital 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov today told a news 
conference that a us senate resolution passed last week on 
lithuania can even detonate the difficult and explosive situation 
in the republic 
the senate on thursday urged the soviet union to halt its 
intimidation of lithuania and urged president bush to consider the 
republics request for diplomatic relations

the bush administration today refused to 
criticize moscow for seizing army deserters in lithuania saying 
we do not want to inflame the situation 
the restrained us reaction marked a sudden change in tone 
after repeated expressions of white house concern about possible 
use of force and intimidation by the kremlin against the breakaway 
baltic republic 
refusing to characterize the soviet seizure of deserters white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we simply are not 
going to try to give definition to words like force and 
intimidation 
a soviet diplomat in washington sergei chetverikov defended 
the action by quoting vice president dan quayle as saying that 
every army should have some discipline 
on monday fitzwater had said the soviet armys occupation of 
communist party buildings in lithuania marked an escalation of 
developments however he declined to characterize the latest 
actions as a further escalation 
i choose not to do it today fitzwater said we simply 
dont feel inflammatory language is helpful we do not want to 
inflame the situation 
fitzwater acknowledged that a blowup in lithuania could disrupt 
ussoviet relations which are proceeding warmly toward expected 
arms agreements this year 
we have made it clear that the relationship is one of the 
factors at stake here fitzwater said 
at the state department a spokeswoman said secretary of state 
james a baker iii had not yet received an answer to a message he 
sent sunday to soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze but 
margaret tutwiler noted that shevardnadze had been away on a trip 
to africa and said baker expects to receive an answer in the coming 
days 
tutwiler denied reports that in his private message to 
shevardnadze baker proposed a deal whereby the united states would 
refrain from criticizing soviet actions in lithuania in return for 
a soviet promise to refrain from using force there was 
absolutely positively no deal or agreement she said 
in the lithuanian capital soviet soldiers stormed two hospitals 
to seize at least 23 lithuanian army deserters in the first violent 
action by moscow since lithuania declared independence 
they beat them with their fists said a duty nurse at a 
psychiatric hospital where windows and iron beds were broken in the 
predawn raid 
on saturday quayle told reporters in phoenix that while the 
soviet union should not threaten lithuania if the soviet union 
is applying disciplinary measures to people in their own military 
thats a different situation 
i do not know what kind of contractual agreement a member of 
the soviet army has when he or she signs up quayle said 
but there is a certain element of discipline that is 
absolutely imperative in any armed force quayle said 
the vice presidents spokesman david beckwith said today he 
in no way countenanced the violent rounding up of deserters

fear for the survival of 180 endangered 
squirrels atop an isolated mountain led a judge to block the start 
of construction on what could become the worlds most powerful 
observatory 
us district judge alfredo c marquez on monday granted a 
fourmonth injunction barring the university of arizona from 
beginning construction on the first two of at least three 
telescopes at the planned 200 million mount graham international 
observatory 
if all goes smoothly with the first two telescopes a third 
device that would have the viewing power o a telescope more than 37 
feet in diameter is planned for the mid1990s 
the judge said serious questions had been raised over whether 
the construction would cause irreparable harm to the mount graham 
red squirrel 
im surprised im encouraged said dr robin silver a 
spokesman for the maricopa county audubon society this has been 
a tough process all along im encouraged that the system can still 
work 
the university has decided to appeal spokesman steve emerine 
said today 
mount graham in the pinaleno mountains in southeastern arizona 
is the only known habitat for the 180 remaining squirrels 
in 1988 the us fish and wildlife service concluded in a 
biological report for the us forest service the sites landlord 
that the telescopes could coexist with the squirrel arizonas 
congressional delegation then pushed through legislation ordering 
the forest service to grant the university a permit for 
construction 
but environmental groups sued contending that perching the 
telescopes on an 86acre site on one of mount grahams three peaks 
would assure the extinction of the 8ounce squirrels by taking away 
more of the forested land they need to survive 
university officials contend poor pine cone crops in recent 
years have hurt the squirrel population they said hunting 
logging use of offroad vehicles and christmas treecutting have 
been stopped because of the planned observatory and that 60 to 80 
acres will be reforested 
in closing arguments lawyers for the university and the justice 
department said that the congressional act precluded any further 
environmental review of the squirrels habitat in connection with 
the first three telescopes 
but marquez said monday he had some questions about whether the 
wildlife services ruling was preordained 
he asked justice department lawyer larry bradfish whats the 
harm of saying there are some very serious issues here and 
congress you have 120 days why dont you take another look at 
it 
university officials said they were disappointed by the ruling 
us rep jim kolbe rariz said he did not think congress 
would take new action 
there would have to be a major change in the status of the 
squirrel or an alteration of the biological facts absent that i 
cant see any reason for congress to act kolbe said 
two biologists who took part in the wildlife service study 
alleged in depositions that officials at the agency ordered 
researchers to argue in favor of construction 
the agencys regional director mike spear upheld the study as 
biologically sound but last month after the construction site 
was designated as a critical habitat spear called for another 
study

lawyers trying to block the first execution in 
california in 23 years made a lastditch appeal to the federal 
courts 
attorneys charles sevilla and michael mccabe filed a 114page 
petition in us district court late monday seeking a stay for the 
april 3 execution date of robert alton harris convicted of killing 
two teenage boys in 1978 
even as the appeal was being filed nobel peace prize winner 
mother teresa was pleading with gov george deukmejian to spare 
harris life deukmejian during a fiveminute telephone 
conversation told her that the public has overwhelmingly decided 
that the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment for 
convicted murderers according to a statement from the governors 
office 
about 30 members of amnesty international demonstrated against 
the execution outside the us embassy in london today 
the human rights organization left a letter for the ambassador 
saying we are particularly concerned that this case will create 
a precedent for other states in the united states which are not 
currently carrying out execution the 37yearold harris withdrew 
from a scheduled clemency hearing tuesday saying deukmejians 
longtime advocacy of the death penalty prevented him from receiving 
a fair and impartial review before the governor 
us district judge william enright scheduled a hearing for 3 
pm wednesday 
if enright rejects the stay request the defense lawyers next 
move would be to file a petition with the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals a denial at the 9th circuit would leave only an appeal to 
the us supreme court which has denied harris appeals four times 
harris could be the first person executed in the gas chamber at 
san quentin since 1967 when aaron mitchell was put to death for 
the murder of a sacramento police officer 
repeating arguments that were rejected by the states high court 
earlier this month the defense lawyers in their petition claimed 
that harris was wrongly characterized during his 1979 trial as a 
sociopath who killed for pleasure and was incapable of remorse 
more recent evaluations and studies indicate harris violent 
behavior was the product of an abusive childhood organic brain 
damage causing him to act impulsively and lingering effects damage 
caused by his mothers heavy drinking while pregnant with him the 
petition said 
the lawyers also claimed that it was cruel and unusual 
punishment to have harris live under the threat of death for 11 
years and that it would be wrong to execute him now they said 
harris is a changed man 
harris shot and killed the boys and stole their car for use in a 
bank robbery he had abducted the youths as they sat in their 
parked car at a drivein restaurant ordered them to a remote spot 
and then shot them

from 1953 to 1961 said i believe he would like to be thought of 
simply as the good soldier 
he walked with kings but never forgot his home in abilene 
kansas eisenhower said he was the vaunted warrior who hated 
war he was the fivestar general who warned of the dangers of an 
unbridled militaryindustrial complex 
walter cronkite retired cbs television news anchor saluted 
eisenhower as the greatest hero of the greatest war in history 
no man did more to rid our planet of the nazi scourge 
senate republican leader bob dole himself a disabled veteran of 
world war ii said in prepared remarks

a government commission on tuesday said racism 
particularly against north african immigrants is spreading in 
france and premier michel rocard asked all political parties to 
combat this threat to our national heritage 
rocard made his appeal after receiving a 400page report from a 
commission appointed to investigate what has become the countrys 
most pressing social problem 
racial tensions intensified during the sixmonth investigation 
this month alone three moroccan immigrants have been killed in 
incidents that prompted protests by human rights groups 
the socialist government and its centerright rivals have called 
for tolerance but the farright national front has stepped up its 
campaign against immigration 
the commission said racism against north africans was the most 
widespread increasing markedly in 1989 about 4 million of 
frances 55 million residents are immigrants mainly moslems from 
north africa 
the commission said 75 percent of french people responding to a 
survey it conducted said they believe there are too many north 
africans in france 
the report said the number of racial attacks and threats jumped 
to 237 in november and december compared to 135 in the same period 
of 1988 the increase followed a nationwide controversy that 
focused on whether moslem girls should be allowed to wear islamic 
scarves to public schools 
the controversy focused attention on immigrants place in french 
society the nationwide debate began when several local school 
officials barred moslem girls from classes because they insisted on 
wearing traditional islamic scarves the officials cited a law 
prohibiting display of religious symbols in schools 
the government eventually relented saying the scarves could be 
worn as long as education was not disrupted 
antisemitism also persists the commission said referring to 
revisionist theories that the nazi concentration camps did not 
exist it cited skinhead and facist groups as among the 
culprits 
racism is found at all levels of social life and in all parts 
of the country said the commission which decried the 
exploitation of racial fears by political candidates 
in incidents this month a bus driver was charged with willful 
homicide for running over and killing a 17yearold immigrant a 
cook shot at two moroccan brothers killing one and a police 
brigadier was detained briefly after shooting to death a young 
moroccan who purportedly tried to escape from a police vehicle 
after being arrested 
the report said political and civic leaders need a twopronged 
approach the will to enforce laws against racism and the foresight 
to take preventative steps 
these priorities should be coupled with efforts to enhance the 
assimilation of immigrants into french society and eliminate 
discrimination it said 
rocard invited leaders of his own socialist party the two 
centerright parties and the communist party to a meeting april 3 
to launch an antiracism initiative no invitation was sent to the 
national front whose leader jean marie le pen has described the 
political hierarchys outcry over racism as indecent 
the recent violence according to le pen is directly tied to 
social phenomena resulting from immigration policies which they are 
directly responsible for

in the great plains and may have caused some damage in a few 
southern areas where top growth was heavier a government report 
said tuesday

brought some beneficial moisture to the northern plains during 
the week of march 1925 
wheat growth in kansas was reported excellent early in the week

departments weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not 
include production forecasts 
looking at other crops the report said fieldwork progressed 
well in the mississippi delta as fields dried corn planting was 
more than onethird complete in alabama but earlier flooding may 
force some replanting 
rice planting continued in louisiana and cotton farmers 
continued planting in arizona and southern california tobacco was 
reported in goodtofair condition in georgia and north carolina 
and in fairtogood shape in south carolina 
the storm in the northern plains was a hardship for livestock 
and newborn calves despite its moisture benefits for pastures and 
crops the report said pastures were said to be in mostly 
goodtofair condition in the delta and east

japanese entities was more than 120 million heinz estimated 
the act first passed in 1938 requires lobbyists to disclose 
the amount of money they receive from foreign governments and what 
they do for the fee but it is fraught with loopholes witnesses 
said 
another witness before the senate foreign relations committee 
owen bieber said reforms are needed bieber is president of the 
international union united automobile aerospace and agricultural 
implement workers of america 
foreign governments and companies today are spending hundreds 
of millions of dollars to influence public policy in our country 
he said the sheer amount of money and the manner in which it is 
spent are distorting our political process these excesses demand 
reform 
heinz said his interest was piqued recently by a case involving 
toshiba corps efforts to avoid congressional sanctions after 
toshiba machine sold the soviet union precision milling equipment 
used for the production of submarine propellers 
toshiba paid the law firm of mudge rose guthrie alexander and 
ferndon nearly 11 million to act on its behalf heinz said but 
heinz said toshibas scores of subsidiaries were not required to 
register 
registration is not presently required for most subsidiaries 
or for clients where the agent did not engage in any reportable 
activity heinz said 
heinz bill would make three principal changes 
it would force companies that are more than 50 percent foreign 
owned to register with the justice department when they hire 
lobbyists 
it would repeal an exemption now granted to lawyers for 
administrative or judicial proceedings 
it would require all agents to file their forms on jan 30 and 
june 30 instead of every six months from the day they registered 
bieber praised the legislation but suggested it could go 
further for one thing congress should act to end the revolving 
door between us trade officials and foreign companies 
starting on jan 1 1991 former federal officials who have been 
involved in trade or treaty negotiations will be prohibited from 
aiding or assisting any foreign company or government with which 
they had negotiated the ban will be in effect for a year 
bieber also said i believe the time has come to start looking 
at imposing limits on the amounts that foreign governments and 
companies can spend to lobby our legislative and executive branches 
of government 
sen claiborne pell dri the committee chairman agreed with 
heinz that the act will have to be tightened up steadily as we go 
along

one week cathy mclaughlin was planning lectures 
for distinguished harvard alumni the next shed started a new life 
with the new kids rock idols she now shepherds past thousands of 
screaming girls 
thats what can happen when someone makes a job switch that is 
well totally radical 
its absolutely crazy its 18 hours a day mclaughlin said 
its a big change in lifestyle you can imagine 
until last year mclaughlin was director of alumni affairs at 
harvard universitys john f kennedy school of government she 
traded in that lofty title to become assistant road manager for one 
of pop musics latest sensations new kids on the block 
so she bid farewell to the life of academia and joined a world 
where the greatest joy is finding a quiet place to sleep 
every 14yearold girl would like to meet the new kids 
mclaughlin said in a telephone interview this week from new jersey 
where the group concluded a recent tour 
they live and die for them she said and when you go to 
the concert the screams are louder than the music 
but how does someone go so quickly from the quiet halls of the 
ivy league to the earsplitting crowds at rock arenas 
strangely enough it was quite logical 
mclaughlin 28 worked with two presidential campaigns in 1984 
for walter f mondale and two years ago for gov michael s 
dukakis her job as an advance person required her to go to cities 
ahead of the candidates and plan for their arrival 
her work eventually got the attention of dukakis son john 
dukakis who works for the new kids business manager so when the 
group was looking for another road manager last year dukakis gave 
mclaughlin a call 
anybody whos done political advance work would have the 
skills and stamina to work with rock n roll on the road the 
younger dukakis said you need an ability to adapt to changing 
situations you have to have a cando attitude 
mclaughlin who had been directing the kennedy school alumni 
office for about 18 months took a leave of absence last june to 
join the band for a summer tour when she returned to her job in 
the fall the excitement was in her system she left the post a 
month later to work for the group full time 
and in this job full time means full time 
aside from scheduling the usual travel plans and interviews 
mclaughlin must be ever prepared for the unexpected like when the 
band members suddenly want to go on a shopping spree and she has to 
arrange a limousine and security staff 
or when parents wait outside her hotel room until 3 am hoping 
shell let their kids see the kids 
back at the kennedy school her former coworkers think her new 
job is exciting 
were all living vicariously through her said steve singer 
director of the schools press office she calls in from the road 
now and then and tells us stories 
its a lot more exciting than setting up alumni receptions 
he said

hungarys national elections were 
significant in relegating the socialist party created by communist 
reformers to a relatively minor opposition role 
but the vote is unlikely to bring greater political liberty to 
people already enjoying most of the privileges of westernstyle 
democracy nor will it quickly solve pressing economic woes 
voters used their new freedom to deal harshly with old guard 
communists who refused to join reformers in forming the socialist 
party last year with most votes counted they seemed to have been 
shut out of parliament 
as in east germany on march 18 voters clearly associated the 
ruling socialist party with the dark authoritarian past despite 
its stated commitment to democracy when it was created in october 
hungarys rulers were the only communists in the soviet bloc to 
opt for full democracy without mass demonstrations or violence by 
sundays election their gradual embrace of reforms had created a 
society as free as western ones in many aspects 
laws and decrees enacted in the last two years have lifted 
travel restrictions permitted political plurality and freedom of 
opinion and removed major restrictions on free enterprise 
most hungarians consider their newspapers state radio and 
television as free as the media in western europe 
the majority of voters expressed the fact that they do not 
want to legalize anything they could suspect as having anything to 
do with what they know as socialism said nepszabadsag the 
former socialist party daily in comments on the election results 
the anticommunist backlash translated into major gains for two 
parties who campaigned on a platform that associated the socialists 
with past excesses 
the hungarian democratic forum a broadbased conservative party 
drawing on traditional nationalist and populist sentiments and the 
league of free democrats with philosophies akin to european 
liberal and social democratic parties each won more than 20 
percent of the vote 
as the chief contenders going into runoffs tentatively scheduled 
april 8 both the democratic forum and the free democrats are 
presenting themselves as the next likely governing party either 
alone or in coalition with others oppposed to the socialists and 
communists 
both advocate a market economy although the democratic forum is 
not opposed to a sizeable state sector if it works efficiently 
but neither can offer immediate solutions to the economic 
malaise left by four decades of rigid command economy marked by the 
same inefficiency and stagnation found in other soviet bloc 
countries 
many unprofitable state enterprises were kept alive over the 
past few years only by billions of borrowed dollars billions more 
went into providing the population with consumer goods unavailable 
in other soviet bloc countries creating a false picture of a 
relatively welloff society 
the new government whatever its shape must foot the bill the 
20 billion foreign debt is the highest per capita within the 
soviet bloc for years debt servicing will absorb capital that 
could otherwise finance needed domestic investment and social 
programs 
money for such projects is chronically scarce in a country 
facing growing poverty and unemployment as it prepares for the 
painful changeover to a market economy last years budget deficit 
exceded 60 billion forints about 10 billion 
the lack of hard currency needed to service the foreign debt has 
been exacerbated by the hemorrhage of dollars west german marks 
and austrian schillings out of the country 
by november about 15 billion had been handed out to 
hungarians enjoying their newfound freedom to travel abroad and 
claiming their 400 annual travel allotment to buy goods not 
available at home 
the government was forced to cut the allowance to 50 as a 
result but the outflow continued because of easy black market 
access to hard currency for hungarians planning a trip abroad 
inflation was 17 percent in 1989 for the second year in a row 
it has been fueled by the policy of allotting large raises to 
workers in the state sector workers in other state enterprises 
deemed unprofitable beyond saving are being let go creating a 
growing and restive force of unemployed 
recognizing that there is no quick fix for the daunting task of 
economic revival most parties repeatedly cautioned citizens 
against expecting miracles from any new government 
reflecting popular sentiment among experts socialist premier 
miklos nemeth an economist and one of the reform communists most 
responsible for the countrys democratic turn told a reporter that 
he didnt expect the economy to markedly improve before 1995 
commenting after sundays first round of voting nemeth urged 
the quick formation of a new government after the runoff elections 
because the state of the hungarian economy does not permit a 
vacuum in decision making

the supreme court on tuesday upheld strict 
limits on political campaign spending by corporations ruling their 
freespeech rights are outweighed by the need to subdue bigmoney 
influence over elections 
the decision was hailed by the federal election commission and 
common cause as a major victory for honest government but the 
american civil liberties union said it unfairly discriminates 
against corporations 
in a 63 ruling the court upheld a michigan law challenged by 
that states chamber of commerce twenty other states and the 
federal government have similar statutes 
the laws ban corporations and trade associations such as the 
chamber of commerce from spending money from their treasuries on 
behalf of political candidates 
the laws permit businesses and others to make such expenditures 
only if they set up special funds or political action committees 
that must keep detailed records and disclose the names of 
contributors 
tuesdays decision does not affect corporate spending to promote 
political issues submitted to voters in ballot referenda the 
ruling applies only to elections for public office 
in other developments the court 
heard arguments over the power of state governors to withhold 
national guard troops from peacetime training in central america a 
decision is expected by july 
upheld federal regulation of payments to lawyers who help coal 
miners win government benefits for black lung disability 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said the 
michigan campaign spending statute is justified by the states 
interest in preventing corruption or its appearance 
the state has a compelling interest in eliminating from the 
political process the corrosive effect of political war chests 
amassed by corporations he said corporate wealth can unfairly 
influence elections 
the michigan law was designed to prevent corporate giants such 
as major automobile manufacturers in detroit from funneling 
millions of dollars through the chamber of commerce to candidates 
without revealing the spending 
marshall also rejected arguments that the law is 
unconstitutional because it exempts labor unions and media 
corporations 
unlike those who contribute to a corporate treasury marshall 
said union members who disagree with the unions political 
activities can withhold some of their dues without giving up their 
membership 
he added that media corporations merit exemption to protect the 
role of broadcasters and publishers in reporting and commenting on 
newsworthy events 
in a dissenting opinion justice antonin scalia said the 
court today endorses the principle that too much speech is an evil 
that the democratic majority can proscribe the principle is 
incompatible with the absolutely central truth of the first 
amendment that government cannot be trusted to assure through 
censorship the fairness of political debate 
justices anthony m kennedy and sandra day oconnor also 
dissented 
federal election commission spokesman fred eiland said the 
ruling safeguards a law that since 1907 has been the foundation of 
federal efforts to control campaign spending 
if this had gone the other way it would be opening the 
floodgates for unrestrained corporate spending he said 
common cause a group that advocates strict control over 
campaign spending also praised the ruling 
but arthur spitzer of the american civil liberties union said 
the ruling unfairly singles out corporations 
this kind of discrimination makes no sense to us he said 
he also said the decision is an indictment of democracy because 
it suggests people will vote for candidates based on how much money 
they spend not what they stand for 
the michigan chamber of commerce has some 8000 duespaying 
members about threefourths of them corporations 
the chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the 
grand rapids press in support of richard bandstra a republican 
candidate for the state house of representatives 
the trade association challenged the state campaign finance law 
in federal court fearing it would be fined 10000 under the act 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled the law was 
unconstitutional as applied to the chamber of commerce 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 supreme court ruling 
limiting the federal governments power to regulate corporate 
political spending 
the justices said then that the federal election campaign act of 
1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed 
primarily to influence public opinion and not to make a profit 
the high court in 1986 ruled in favor of a massachusetts group 
formed to protest the legalization of abortion 
but the justices tuesday drew key distinctions between the 
massachusetts group and the chamber of commerce 
marshall said the antiabortion organization raised money from 
its members specifically to attack abortion rights there is no 
reason to believe chamber of commerce funds come from people who 
share the same political views marshall said 
also he said chamber of commerce members may be reluctant for 
economic reasons to withdraw from the organization even if they 
disagree with its support of particular political candidates 
michigan officials said states with similar laws to its own are 
alabama connecticut iowa kentucky minnesota mississippi 
montana new hampshire new york north carolina north dakota 
ohio oklahoma pennsylvania south dakota tennessee texas west 
virginia wisconsin and wyoming

two congressional staff members reportedly on 
john poindexters authority were given details of a hawk missile 
shipment to iran according to a document introduced tuesday at the 
former national security directors irancontra trial 
the document called a stipulation is part of poindexters 
effort to show that he did not try to conceal the us role in the 
missile shipment from congress 
intelligence committee staff members richard giza from the house 
and edward levine from the senate reviewed highly classified 
intelligence information at the national security agency on nov 
20 1986 the document said 
lawyers for poindexter say they will show he approved giza and 
levine going to the nsa and reviewing the data on the reagan 
administrations iran initiative 
the day after the visit poindexter briefed house intelligence 
committee members and the chairman and vice chairman of the senate 
intelligence panel he is accused of obstructing congress and 
making false statements by allegedly telling them he didnt find 
out about the hawk missile shipment until five weeks after it 
occurred 
former nsa legislative liaison kenneth kodama said he watched as 
giza and levine examined a looseleaf notebook containing an inch 
and a half of reports on the iran arms sales 
the reports contained information on the november 1985 delivery 
according to the wording of the stipulation to which both the 
defense and prosecution agreed 
another defense witness former white house computer expert edd 
barnes testified that national security council employees were 
encouraged to delete files from the computer system when they left 
the nsc 
poindexter is accused of deleting 5000 computer files in late 
november 1986 to try to obstruct congress in connection with the 
hawks shipment 
barnes testified that poindexter was very aware of a backup 
tape from which all of poindexters computer messages were 
retrieved the backup tape ordinarily is stripped of old messages 
every two weeks but the tape was preserved in late november 
because of the irancontra affair 
earlier sen john chafee testified as a character witness for 
poindexter 
defense attorney richard beckler asked chafee if he had formed 
an opinion of poindexter for truth and veracity 
he had the highest reputation for truthfulness and 
character chafee said 
poindexter was adminisrative assistant to chafee when the rhode 
island republican was secretary of the navy in the nixon 
administration 
under questioning from irancontra prosecutor dan webb chafee 
said he had had no discussions with poindexter regarding how to 
respond to congressional inquiries into whether oliver north was 
assisting the contras militarily 
poindexter is accused of concealing from congress norths 
military assistance to the contras as well as the us role in the 
november 1985 hawk missile shipment to iran

its probably the nature of the beast the 
annual academy awards telecast simply cannot be housebroken 
the good intentions the resolve that the mistakes of last 
years tacky overstuffed show wouldnt be repeated seem to have 
gone for naught 
monday nights 62nd annual academy awards on abc stretched to a 
mindboggling three hours and 34 minutes was as bloated and boring 
as ever 
are the academy awards unconquerable perhaps its best to sit 
back accept that they will never improve and enjoy it still 
even billy crystal a wonderful choice for host seemed overawed 
at times he started out very funny his best line came after 330 
movies were represented in an opening montage celebrating 100 years 
of filmmaking and according to paramount not a one of them has 
gone into profit he said 
the reference to a lawsuit against paramount over film profits 
was much appreciated by the los angeles music center audience 
crystals lampoon of the oscars usual overheated opening 
production number was shorter than most thankyou speeches and 
much more enjoyable that dancing singing dinosaur was eliminated 
from the telecast thank goodness for small favors 
unfortunately crystal ran out of material as quickly as the 
telecast ran out of steam 
at least snow white showed up only briefly as a cartoon in the 
opening montage her appearance last year in the opening production 
number was protested by the disney studio 
the motion picture academy obviously embarrassed by last years 
show began the show with a speech by academy president karl 
malden this attempt to introduce some dignity to the show nearly 
put a deadly pall over the whole proceeding 
the oscar telecast for the first time went international with 
remote appearances from london tokyo australia buenos aires and 
moscow its purpose was to show that the film industry is truly 
international 
what it actually accomplished was to add another excruciating 
hour to the show the only remote that was remotely interesting was 
the touching birthday tribute from tokyo to japanese director akira 
kurosawa 
on the other hand it was feared for a time that howard koch in 
accepting the jean hersholt humanitarian award was going to break 
out his home movies 
most other winners thankfully were limited to 45 seconds 
the wizard of oz is a venerable film that recently 
celebrated its 50th anniversary but what was the point in having 
diana ross lead a roundtheworld singalong of somewhere over 
the rainbow as the show was coasting quite slowly to an end 
the only possible answer and not a very good one is that someone 
wanted to dazzle us with the technical wizardry of the 
multisatellite linkup 
oddly enough some of the best things about the telecast were 
the commercials by prudential bache paying homage to movie 
classics a suggestion let the maker of those commercials produce 
next years oscar telecast

ron kovic and his passage from patriotic soldier to antiwar

longtime associate of lyndon b johnson cracked who let him in 
the pulitzer prizewinning author says he expects to come in for 
criticism in texas for his dark portrayal of johnson in the second 
volume of his biography of the late president but he thinks 
critics are missing the point 
i wanted to show the transformation caro was quoted as 
saying in an interview published tuesday in the austin 
americanstatesman 
i dont write biographies just to show the lives of famous 
men i wanted to show what happened with american politics at the 
dawn of a new age of media politics he added the turning point 
was the 1948 democratic primary for the us senate between johnson 
and former gov coke stevenson 
nobody had ever run a campaign like that before said caro 
who in his book means of ascent portrayed johnson as evil and 
stevenson as a romantic heroic figure 
caro 53 said the same vigorous reaction greeted his first 
volume path to power 
the initial reaction is controversy after a while all thats 
left is the book the book endures caro said 
rep jake pickle dtexas who was an aide and heir to johnsons 
congressional seat said caro made coke a saint we respected 
coke as a solid sort of conservative but we didnt think of him as 
a man of vision the saint of all texans he was just calculatin

governments on tuesday urged restraint in 
lithuania but in cautious statements nearly all avoided directly 
attacking moscow after its first use of force against the 
secessionist republic 
only norway severely criticized the soviet government it called 
the storming of two hospitals by soviet troops to seize red army 
deserters brutal and unwise 
the bush administration refrained from denunciations saying it 
did not want to inflame the situation 
in western europe the european community appealed for maximum 
restraint 
polands solidarity leader lech walesa expressed grave 
anxiety in a letter to president mikhail s gorbachev he accused 
the soviet leader of a violating the sovereignty of lithuania 
elsewhere in eastern europe most of moscows allies made no 
comment although the news media reported fully the tense 
developments in vilnius the lithuanian capital 
the restrained comment from washington was a change from its 
repeated expressions of concern recently about the possible use of 
force against lithuania 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater refused to 
characterize the seizure of army deserters as an escalation of 
force 
i choose not to do it today fitzwater said we simply 
dont feel inflammatory language is helpful we do not want to 
inflame the situation 
the 12nation european community issued the call for restraint 
in a statement from its brussels headquarters 
it added that it hoped for a respectful open and fair 
dialogue between moscow and vilnius avoiding the use of force or 
the threat of the use of force 
most members of the community have never recognized the 
incorporation of lithuania into the soviet union in 1940 
but at the same time many western european governments have 
noted that gorbachev faces what french president francois 
mitterrand recently called terrible problems as lithuania and 
other republics demand independence 
in the british house of commons prime minister margaret 
thatcher sidestepped demands to condemn gorbachev and to equate the 
military action in lithuania with the invasions of hungary and 
czechoslovakia in 1956 and 1968 
undoubtedly this is a very difficult situation both for 
president gorbachev and the people of lithuania said mrs 
thatcher it calls for great restraint on both sides force is 
not an appropriate way to settle this petition it will not help 
to be provocative in any way on either side 
political officers of the 16nation nato alliance who met in a 
special session monday and tuesday in brussels hinted that the 
hospital attacks and moscows show of force in lithuania over the 
weekend could damage improved eastwest relations 
if the situation is not solved peacefully through 
negotiations it could derail a lot of other things said a nato 
official speaking in brussels on condition of anonymity 
he said the officials felt that gorbachev and the lithuanian 
leaders should negotiate in an atmosphere free of intimidation 
and that any adverse developments in lithuania would have 
consequences for positive international political trends 
similarly walesa told gorbachev violating the sovereignty of 
lithuania is an action directed against the process of constructing 
a new democratic order in europe 
after lauding gorbachevs reform policies and the soviet 
communist partys relinquishing of its monopoly on power walesa 
said i turn to you mr president to abandon the practice of 
military pressure and undertake political dialogue with the 
lithuanian government 
czechoslovakia said it supported the principle of autonomy in 
whichever form a nation chooses 
naturally we are greatly interested that the prblem with 
lithuania will be resolved in a peaceful manner way added 
president vaclav havels spokesman michael zantovsky 
norwegian prime minister jan p syse called moscows parading of 
tanks and his order to confiscate lithuanians firearms a 
shockingly unwise step 
continued use of power will not solve any problems but can 
seriously jeopardize the results recently achieved in eastwest 
relations syse said in a statement 
the netherlands a member of the european community said it 
worried about the increasing pressure that is being exerted 
on the lithuanian population through a military show of force 
in yugoslavia an influential weekly danas predicted that 
other soviet republics may break away from moscow 
one can rightly wonder if the time for the fall of the great 
soviet empire of peoples which is shaking strongly has not 
arrived added danas

thousands of blacks marched 
through a poor township tuesday to protest high rents and black

police said nine other blacks were killed during the past 24

the defense rested its case today in the 
irancontra coverup trial of former national security adviser john 
poindexter after 5 days of testimony 
the case drew to a close without any testimony from poindexter 
who is accused of concealing from congress the us role in a 
november 1985 iran arms shipment and oliver norths secret military 
assistance to the contras 
among the final witnesses for poindexter was rep robert k 
dornan rcalif who testified that there were frequent meetings 
between north and up to 30 congressmen during the period of a 
congressional ban on military aid to the contras 
at the meetings north was told by the congressmen that we 
dont think you are limited by the ban and that it was 
permissible for north to help raise money for the contras dornan 
testified 
since the defense opened its case march 20 poindexters lawyers 
have sought to portray the exnational security adviser as a white 
house official who never lied to congress 
he is accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress 
and two counts of making false statements 
john poindexter is and always has been a person of the highest 
truthfulness honesty and integrity testified retired adm 
james holloway iii a former member of the joint chiefs of staff 
sen john chafee testified earlier in the day that poindexter 
had the highest reputation for truthfulness 
poindexter a retired rear admiral had been administrative 
assistant to chafee when the rhode island republican was secretary 
of the navy in the nixon administration 
meanwhile a document was introduced in court showing that two 
congressional staffers knew about a november 1985 hawk missile 
shipment to iran the day before poindexter allegedly lied about it 
to congress 
the document was a summary of highly classified information 
collected by the national security agency 
defense lawyers plan to show that it was poindexter who 
authorized the release of the information to the staffers that 
would suggest that poindexter had no intent to obstruct congress 
and make false statements when he testified nov 21 1986 because 
he had arranged the previous day for congress to get data on the 
hawks shipment 
defense attorney richard beckler asked chafee if he had formed 
an opinion as to poindexter for truth and veracity 
he had the highest reputation for truthfulness and 
character the senator said 
under questioning from irancontra prosecutor dan webb chafee 
said he had had no discussions with poindexter about how to respond 
to congressional inquiries into whether north was assisting the 
contras militarily 
also monday us district court judge harold greene ruled that 
poindexter may not call a house staff member and former lebanon 
hostage david jacobsen 
greene said jacobsens testimony would inflame the jury with 
the emotional hostage issue jacobsen was held in west beirut from 
may 1985 until november 1986 
beckler said he wanted jacobsen to testify about a conversation 
with poindexter on nov 21 1986 the day poindexter is accused of 
obstructing congress and making false statements about the iranian 
arms sales initiative 
beckler said jacobsen could testify about conveying to 
poindexter serious concern that any inaccurate information about 
the initiative could result in harm to the hostages the judge said 
the testimony would be of marginal use compared with the potential 
for prejudicing the jury 
greene also granted a motion of the house of representatives to 
quash poindexters subpoena for staff member victor johnson 
johnson wrote a memo in june 1986 saying that inquiring into 
norths contrarelated activities would make a good political issue 
it places the administration in a coverup posture johnson 
told rep ronald coleman dtexas coleman introduced a resolution 
of inquiry into norths activities 
greene said any question of whether there was political 
motivation for the resolution of inquiry is irrelevant to the 
criminal case against the former national security adviser

romanias strict antiabortion law repealed 
after the uprising last winter prompted many women to obtain 
illegal abortions or perform abortions on themselves a family 
planning official from that country told a senate panel tuesday 
this law had such terrible consequences that a major slogan of 
the december 1989 uprising was liberty democracy abortion 
gabriella bocec said 
bocec vice president of romanias new family planning 
association said that in the 25 years that abortions were illegal 
in her country up to 86 percent of the maternal deaths were due to 
illegal abortion thousands of children were orphaned by the deaths 
of their mothers from botched illegal abortions she said 
she spoke as the senate labor and human resources committee 
opened the first in a series of hearings on a bill establishing 
broad guarantees of a womans right to an abortion supporters 
describe it as effectively writing into federal law the supreme 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision which antiabortion advocates 
seek to overturn 
aside from bocecs testimony the hearing was a replay of the 
most emotional arguments available to each side in the debate over 
abortion 
house and senate opponents of abortion described a fetus as a 
human life meriting protection from the moment of conception rep 
christopher smith rnj described in graphic detail what the 
various methods of abortion do to a fetus 
on the other side marilyn mosley 52 of birmingham ala 
described how she performed an abortion on herself with knitting 
needles at the age of 20 james friedl of concord calif cried as 
he described watching his mother die in 1929 in convulsions after 
secretly taking a drug to induce an abortion 
sheri matulis of peoria ill described being viciously raped 
and slashed in 1954 unable to obtain an abortion for the resulting 
pregnancy she said she resorted to the most painful and 
degrading experience of my life an illegal abortionist who did 
his work with a glass of whiskey in one hand 
she called the selfinduced abortion horrendous but she 
said i would do the same thing again because i believe having 
an abortion is a personal right and no one can take that away 
sen orrin hatch rutah a conservative considered an opponent 
of abortion questioned the witnesses and acknowledged the power of 
their testimony 
im rapidly coming to the conclusion we have to do more with 
family planning hatch said 
both sides are very sincere and have arguments that have to be 
listened to hatch said i am so pressured i dont know what to 
do right now 
sharleen richard a union lake mich medical sonographer 
testified that advances in technology permit high quality pictures 
of the fetus in the womb and amount to a powerful argument against 
abortion 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio the presiding member of the 
panel and a supporter of the bill ruled she could not show 
videotapes of sonographs until after the hearing richard also was 
denied the chance to show her tapes to a house panel earlier this 
month

residents have blocked plans for paul 
mccartney to perform at the yale bowl and the mayor says that may 
mean a 350000 loss for the city 
yale university said it would end negotiations with the former 
beatle because mayor john daniels had withdraw his support for the 
concert 
daniels said his administration could not back plans for the 
concert because residents living near the 70000seat stadium did 
not want it used for concerts 
it is extremely unfortunate because the city stood a good 
chance of making as much as 350000 from the concert at a time 
when we are being forced to lay off people and cut city services 
the mayor said monday 
alderman jonathan einhorn who rallied residents in his district 
to oppose concerts at the bowl said no one is singling out 
mccartney as a matter of fact hes someone of our vintage

a doctor on an international team 
sent to investigate a myserious illness in kosovo province tuesday 
blamed mass hysteria among ethnic albanians for the ailment which 
has led to renewed unrest 
also tuesday news reports said serbian authorities 
administering kosovo fired 100 ethnic albanian police for allegedly 
allowing albanian nationalists to attack members of the slav 
minority 
ethnic albanians have accused slavs of causing the illness by 
poisoning ethnic albanian students 
the usbased helsinki watch human rights organization 
appointed an international panel of doctors to assess the 
situation a dutch member of the team said the group found no 
evidence of poisoning or epidemics attributing the mysterious 
incident to mass hysteria 
but the doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity to the 
associated press said there was definitely no stage managing 
of the alleged epidemic 
if you are a parent and if your daughter complains of stomach 
pains and you hear other parents are rushing their children to the 
hospital you do not hesitate to do the same thing he said 
a yugoslav parliamentary commission said monday that 2990 
ethnic albanians were hospitalized in kosovo last week complaining 
of lung and skin problems but it found no evidence of poisoning 
serbian officials accused albanian nationalists of organizing 
the incident saying the illness was faked 
the serbian police raided nine ethnic albanian homes arresting 
six ethnic albanians and seizing four guns 10 gas masks and 
ammunition the official tanjug news agency said tuesday 
media reports in belgrade the federal and serbian capital said 
serbian police intend to purge 70 percent of ethnic albanians from 
police ranks and 100 already have been fired 
kosovo is one of two provinces of serbia the largest of the six 
yugoslav republics 
the majority ethnic albanians are pressing for restoration of 
the autonomy they lost march 28 1989 when the government approved 
constitutional changes that gave serbia almost complete control 
over kosovo 
serbia will mark the anniversary as a holiday 
the proclamation of march 28 as a serbian national holiday 
represents a provocation whose aim is to further escalate political 
conflicts in kosovo and yugoslavia read a statement from the 
democratic union the largest independent ethnic albanian party in 
kosovo 
the changes were said to be needed to protect the serbian 
minority from ethnic albanian harassment yugoslav liberals and 
western human rights monitors say they have led to a series of 
human rights abuses including indiscriminate arrests sackings and 
other harassment of ethnic albanians 
more than 60 people mostly ethnic albanians have died in 
ethnic violence in kosovo in the past year 
kosovo which borders albania was a part of ancient serbia 
most of the christian serbs in the province view the moslem 
albanians as intruders

former president jimmy carter said today the 
united states should use its maximum influence to nudge israel and 
its arab neighbors to negotiate peace in the middle east 
carter just back from a trip to the middle east told 
reporters i think that theres a general acceptance now that a 
comprehensive peace is not only necessary but i think inevitable 
how long it takes he said will depend on the people involved 
and how enthusiastic others including the united states 
government are in pursuing this process 
the united states has been pressing the israelis to open talks 
with the palestinians the israeli coalition government recently 
fell not long after president bush stirred controversy by 
criticizing the settlement of soviet jews in east jerusalem 
i think our government ought to use its maximum influence 
not pressure in israel and the other countries as well to go to 
the bargaining table to find peace carter said after emerging 
from a 35minute meeting with president bush in the oval office 
carter was asked whether the united states has pushed the 
israelis too hard to negotiate 
i think what president bush has expressed is a policy thats 
been our governments for the last 23 years said the former 
president just back from his latest trip to the middle east 
he remarked at the outset of the meeting with bush i was 
encouraged by this trip more than any ive had in the last 10 
years 
carter played a leading role in monitoring last months 
elections in nicaragua in which sandinista president daniel ortega 
lost to violeta de chamorro 
it was the first time bush and carter had talked since the 
nicaraguan elections secretary of state james a baker iii also 
attended the meeting 
carter was overheard mentioning the situation in lithuania as he 
and bush posed for photographers at the start of the meeting 
carter told reporters afterwards president gorbachev faces a 
quandary is he going to let part of the soviet union break off 
and at the same time how to treat with compassion and understanding 
the move that he himself has precipitated toward democracy and 
toward freedom and toward the expression of independence 
i think our government has played it very well so far by 
impoloring all parties not to resort to force or violence and to 
resolve this in a peaceful fashion said the former president 
asked if there was a danger ussoviet relations could unravel 
carter said theres always a danger but i dont want to comment 
on it

the pentagon defended the administrations 
policy of maintaining a chemical weapons stockpile on tuesday as a 
spokesman confirmed it is considering forcing two chemical firms to 
sell the army a key ingredient for poison gas 
the army has used up its supplies of the chemical thionyl 
chloride accrued from the 1950s and has sought new supplies from 
occidental petroleum co and the pittsburghbased mobay corp a 
subsidiary of the west german chemical firm bayer ag officials 
said 
both companies have refused to supply the chemical and told the 
pentagon their corporate policies bar them from providing chemicals 
that would be used in the production of chemical weapons 
given the firms responses officials from the two agencies are 
conferring on what action to take 
the administration could invoke the defense production act of 
1950 which gives the government the authority to compel the sale 
of material to the pentagon for reasons of national security 
in the meantime the army is attempting to locate thionyl 
chloride from other sources pentagon spokesman bob hall told 
reporters at a briefing 
the chemical is used to make the poison gas to fill the 
artillery shells for binary chemical weapons that could be used in 
battle 
president bush has decried the proliferation of chemical weapons 
and the administration has proposed a treaty limiting their use 
but pending an international accord the administration contends 
the united states must maintain a supply of such weapons to deter 
their use by other nations 
the administration also has attempted to block the export of the 
chemical to nations believed to be involved in chemical weapons 
production 
hall noted that the next step could be up to the department of 
commerce which as yet has not directed the companies to provide 
the chemical to the us government 
they have the authority under the defense production act of 
1950 to compel acceptance of defenserelated production orders 
by companies capable of producing the required item or material 
hall said 
he noted that as the administration has moved ahead with its 
plans to destroy its old stockpiles of unitary chemical weapons 
those that carry a lethal gas mixture it decided to move ahead 
with production of binary weapons which use two chemicals that mix 
and become lethal only after being fired 
as we destroy the unitary weapons stockpiles we are producing 
a small stockpile of binary chemical weapons which will serve as a 
deterrence against the use of chemical weapons against the united 
states hall said 
there are good reasons why we want to maintain a reserve 
stockpile during the process of negotiating the treaty and 
particularly the binary because they are a better system hall 
said we need to proceed with this small program to do so we 
need the chemicals supplied by commercial suppliers 
hall said there are other companies that could be potential 
sources of the chemical but he declined to identify them or state 
whether they were able to supply the material

the soviet union has told the united states it 
transferred ss23 missiles to three east european allies but the 
state department is still not sure whether this violates a 1987 
treaty a spokeswoman said tuesday 
in response to queries from washington soviet officials said 
the mediumrange missiles were sent to bulgaria east germany and 
czechoslovakia said margaret tutwiler the united states also has 
asked other members of the sevennation warsaw pact whether they 
received such missiles she said 
the united states asked the soviets about the missiles after an 
east german news report about such weapons being deployed in east 
germany 
both east germany and czechoslovakia which have shed their 
communist governments in recent months have confirmed to the 
united states that they received soviet missiles tutwiler said 
another official said east germany told the united states the 
missiles were transferred in 1985 
the czech government told the united states that the soviets 
transferred 72 missiles to their country tutwiler said the czechs 
are cooperating fully with the united states which is trying to 
determine what kind of missiles and when they were transferred she 
said 
the key question is whether the missiles were transfered before 
or after the signing of the intermediate nuclear forces or inf 
treaty in december 1987 
if the weapons were transferred before the treaty was signed by 
former president reagan and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
they are not covered by the pact 
if they were transferred after it was signed the transfer would 
violate the treaty 
we will be unable to comment further until we have received 
all responses and analyzed that information she said 
us officials were disconcerted by the discovery of the 
missiles which they had not known about until now arms control 
officials are also concerned by east germanys decision to destroy 
the missiles 
we have to first determine whether these are covered by the 
treaty and should indeed be destroyed said one official it 
has to do with setting the record straight and giving credibility 
to verification procedures said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the question of verification is one of the stickiest in 
negotiations under way for halving the us and soviet arsenals of 
longrange intercontinental missiles gorbachev and bush have both 
said they would like such a treaty completed in time for their june 
summit 
the inf treaty bans all us and soviet missiles with a range of 
between 300 and 3400 miles

preliminary studies in mice suggest 
that an air pollutant may hasten the spread of cancer within the 
body a researcher said tuesday 
mice with cancer that breathed air containing nitrogen dioxide 
which is found in smog showed higher numbers of cancercell 
colonies in their lungs than mice than breathed purified air said 
arnis richters 
it is very difficult to say at this point what does it mean 
for human populations said richters an associate professor of 
pathology at the university of southern california school of 
medicine in los angeles 
he spoke at a science writers seminar sponsored by the american 
cancer society 
in other presentations researchers said doctors often overlook 
a warning sign for cancer in the mouth and said a new treatment 
strategy appears promising for cancer of the esophagus 
about 11500 new cases of cancer of the mouth are diagnosed each 
year an estimated 10600 new cases of cancer of the esophagus are 
expected to be diagnosed this year and 9500 people will die from 
it 
in the mouse study animals breathed air with nitrogen dioxide 
levels ranging from 025 to 05 parts per million such levels can 
be reached in los angeles notoriously dirty air richters said 
after breathing the air for six weeks to six months the mice 
were injected with skincancer cells sixty days later their lungs 
were examined to see if cancer had colonized there the mice were 
particularly prone to get lung colonies from the skin cancer 
richters said 
studies showed that breathing air with nitrogen dioxide damaged 
the linings of tiny blood vessels in the lung which may trap 
circulating cancer cells and provide an environment for them to 
grow he said 
the pollutant also reduced numbers of cells that form part of 
the diseasefighting immune system he said 
he recommended that cancer specialists try to find places with 
filtered air for their patients just before and after surgery when 
more cancer cells may be released into the bloodstream 
common cancers in humans that tend to spread to the lung a 
process called metastasis include those of the colon breast and 
prostate 
lance liotta chief of the national cancer institutes section 
of tumor invasion and metastasis said the concept of richters 
paper makes sense 
previous work has shown that lung damage can increase the 
efficiency of metastasis to the lung he said 
but he said it will be difficult to see whether air pollution 
raises lung metastasis in humans because so many other factors are 
involved 
in another presentation dr arthur mashberg of the veterans 
administration medical center in east orange nj said dentists 
and doctors often overlook an early sign of cancer of the mouth 
doctors tend to look for white growths called leukoplakia as an 
early sign of the cancer but a red lesion that persists for 10 to 
14 days with no apparent ongoing irritation is actually more 
ominous he said 
only about 11 percent of leukoplakias are cancerous but some 64 
percent of red lesions called mucosal erythroplasias are cancerous 
he said 
the third presentation dealt with treating cancer of the 
esophagus 
traditional treatment includes radiation or surgery dr 
lawrence coia of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine 
reported on a combined treatment of chemotherapy and radiation 
without surgery 
being able to avoid surgery is an advantage because the 
operation itself is dangerous and survival from the disease still 
is low commented roy sessions of georgetown university 
coia said half of patients whose disease had been confined to 
the esophagus lived more than 18 months after the experimental 
treatment with a corresponding figure of eight months for those 
with more advanced disease 
under traditional treatment with either surgery or radiation 
half of patients die within a year he said

baptism traditionally promises the cleansing of 
sin not so for carmen tortora whose alleged rebirth could 
mean 50 years in prison 
authorities say the 43yearold tortora became a mafia 
soldier during a secretly taped blood initiation that confirmed 
an underworld of solemn oaths and codes of silence so vivid in 
popular imagination 
carmen you were baptized when you were a baby your 
parents did it but now this time we gonna baptize you an 
alleged mafia lieutenant told him during the induction detailed in 
a 113count federal indictment unsealed monday 
us attorney general dick thornburgh said the tape recordings 
of the secret clandestine operation provides unprecedented 
proof that could help convict 21 accused mobsters including the 
reputed boss of the mafia in new england 
all but two of those indicted were in custody tuesday a day 
after the fbi launched a dragnet through rhode island 
massachusetts and connecticut authorities said 
they were held on charges including murder racketeering 
kidnapping drug trafficking gambling obstruction of justice and 
witness intimidation 
thornburgh said monday that in his 20 years investigating 
organized crime people often have asked whether the mafia blood 
rite truly exists the question was answered once and for all 
he said on oct 29 in an unremarkable house on a modest street in 
suburban medford 
this is the first time that youre going to hear it right from 
their own mouths said dennis ocallaghan assistant special 
agent in charge of the fiveyear fbi investigation 
tortora and three other men allegedly were inducted at the boxy 
clapboard home during a sunday ceremony presided over by reputed 
crime boss raymond junior patriarca who was arrested monday at 
his lincoln ri home 
authorities said that on that partly sunny autumn day many 
leaders of new englands most powerful crime family came to medford 
for the baptism of new members one of whom was on a days 
leave from prison 
tortora was the only initiate named in the indictments but 11 
of the 17 alleged mob leaders at the ceremony were among those 
charged authorities said 
there before patriarca and his soldiers tortora pricked 
his trigger finger and recited in italian i want to 
enter into this organization to protect my family and to protect 
all my friends i swear not to divulge this secret and to obey 
with love and omerta 
omerta refers to the code of silence which was explained to 
each new member we get in alive in this organization and the 
only way we gonna get out is dead mobster biagio digiacomo said 
according to authorities 
its no hope no jesus no madonna nobody can help us if we 
ever give up this secret to anybody this thing cannot be 
exposed he said according to court documents 
this thing refers to la cosa nostra which in english means 
this thing of ours officials said 
tortora a bald man with a hangdog face then cupped a flaming 
holy card bearing a picture of the patriarcas family saint in his 
hands while vowing as burns this saint so will burn my soul i 
enter alive into this organization and leave it dead according 
to the indictments 
fbi officials said they did not know the name of the saint they 
also did not say how the meeting was taped 
thomas hughes special agent in charge of the investigation 
said patriarca family members could face grave consequences for 
their slip that fall day when the fbi apparently was two steps 
ahead and armed with a bug 
patriarca and others should be in mortal fear over the 
embarrassment of having such a ceremony recorded he said 
witness previously have testified about mafia induction 
ceremonies but officials said the account revealed in mondays 
indictments for the first time promised prosecutors solid evidence 
of such activity 
its consistent with everything weve ever said about what 
these ceremonies entail said ocallaghan now we finally have 
the evidence and i dont think the value of that can be 
underestimated

more schools are offering sex education to 
combat aids and teen pregnancy but they often sidestep sensitive

all too few programs address the important questions for young

communication and decisionmaking skills and similar issues which 
dominate their thinking and feelings said robert selverstone

which produced the report 
why is it that acquaintance rape has replaced robbery as the 
most serious campus crime why is it that there is so much discord 
in relationships said selverstone at a news conference 
introducing the report sex education 2000 a call to action 
the 36page report noted that 23 states now mandate sex 
education and 23 more encourage the teaching of sex education 
compared with only three requiring it in 1980 
but such instruction is usually preoccupied with disaster 
prevention the report said and tends to deal only with the 
negative aspects of human sexuality 
little or no sex education takes place in the early grades 
according to the report the average amount of classroom time spent 
on sexuality is 117 hours in grade 7 and 18 hours in grade 12 
the report written by siecus executive director debra w 
haffner cautioned that sex education by itself should not be 
expected to solve the aids crisis teen pregnancy or other negative 
consequences of sexual behavior 
instead the report called on all segments of the community 
including parents schools religious institutions youth 
organizations health professionals and the media to recognize 
their roles in providing guidance to youngsters 
states should assure that by the year 2000 all children will 
receive comprehensive sexuality education from preschool through 
adulthood the report said 
the report said the 50 states are spending just 648500 on sex 
education and 51 million on aids education and federal support 
has dried up altogether during the past decade according to the 
report 
such spending levels clearly reflect the minimal importance 
this area receives as a public policy priority the report said 
it called for more funds for teacher training and curricular 
materials 
while 74 percent of statemandated curricula discuss condoms 
only 9 percent teach children how to use or obtain them the report 
said 
siecus is a private nonprofit research organization founded 25 
years ago to promote sexual health and education 
the recommendations in the siecus report echo positions by the 
american association of school administrators and other major 
education groups health groups and teacher organizations 
supporting sex education 
last summer for example the national education association 
the nations largest teacher union passed a resolution urging its 
affiliates and members to support appropriately established sex 
education programs 
far from increasing the curricular burdens of public schools 
the siecus proposals would tend to lighten the load said nea 
spokesman howard carroll if youngsters really were taught about 
the full range of sexual issues theyd be less likely to fall prey 
to the crises that wind up burdening school officials he said

president bush will journey to toronto on 
april 10 for a fast round of talks and a few innings of 
baseballwatching with canadian prime minister brian mulroney the 
white house said tuesday 
the two leaders after an afternoon chat will take in some of 
the toronto blue jays home opener that night against the texas 
rangers in the toronto skydome the presidents eldest son george 
walker bush 43 is a partowner of the rangers 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush and mulroney 
will discuss bilateral and international issues of mutual 
interest particularly the changes taking place in europe 
but he acknowledged the lightning visit bush plans to arrive 
in midafternoon stay for only a few innings of the game and 
return to the white house before midnight was mostly baseball 
bush had planned to attend the baseball opener in cincinnati 
next week but the season was delayed a week because of the 
contract dispute in which owners locked players out of spring 
training for 32 days the two sides finally settled march 19 
bush told reporters last wednesday he was still eager to throw 
out a ceremonial first ball somewhere 
i want to do whats right by the national pastime i dont 
want to do it if people think its frivolous the president said 
bush threw out the first ball last april in baltimore where he 
had egyptian president hosni mubarak in tow as his guest mubarak 
seemed baffled by the game 
the joint bushmulroney outing to the skydome the showcase 
park with a retractable dome and a hard rock cafe on the premises 
creates some sticky questions of protocol 
who gets to throw out the first ball 
or if they both make a pitch who throws the real one 
fitzwater dodged the question saying i dont have any 
information 
at the blue jays camp in dunedin fla howard starkman the 
director of public relations called it a very good question i 
dont have an answer for you i think the protocol would have to be 
determined by the prime ministers office 
mulroney by all accounts far more knowledgeable about baseball 
than mubarak threw out the first ball during the blue jays 
championship series last fall with the oakland athletics the as 
won in a rout 
but starkman said mulroney is not as great a fan as bush 
captain of the baseball team at yale bush still keeps his first 
basemans mitt close by 
the rangers and blue jays will start the season on april 9 in 
texas

in a decision seen as a setback to his 
economic reform plan president fernando collor de mello on tuesday 
withdrew two controversial laws related to the plan that jailed 
offenders without bail 
but collor warned that more changes to his plan unveiled march 
16 would destroy brazils chances to curtail 2700 percent 
inflation 
provisional measures 153 and 156 were invoked by police last 
week to arrest and hold without bail some 30 bankers and 
businessmen the measures prohibited selling goods and services 
above the governmentset rate and outlawed tax cheating 
congressmen and legal experts say the measures were 
unconstitutional 
the provisional measures were invoked immediately but required 
congressional approval within 30 days approval seemed unlikely 
collor said he would scrap the measures and resubmit them as a 
bill to congress 
we are not retreating collor said we want to march in 
step with the constitution 
public opinion polls show brazilians overwhelmingly support the 
overall plan which includes an 18month freeze on 115 billion in 
savings accounts and financial market deposits 
one survey showed 94 percent favored the twotofive year prison 
sentences for tax cheating and illegal price hikes 
however several legislators called the decrees dictatorial 
after police invaded the newspaper folha de sao paulo to 
investigate charges of illegal billing the paper called collor a 
fledgling dictator and compared him to benito mussolini 
collor also announced that economy minister zelia cardoso de 
mello would travel abroad next week for talks with creditors of 
brazils 114 billion foreign debt the largest in the third world 
brazil will seek a broad renegotiation of terms he said the 
country now pays about 12 billion a year in interest alone 
although payments have been suspended since september 
last week the economy ministry said debt payments would be 
limited to 5 billion a year 
collor said brazil must guarantee its growth before it can repay 
its debt he said the government would avoid confrontation with 
creditors and predicted talks would be favorable because of the 
credibility recovered by the country

the copilot of the avianca airliner that 
crashed in new york told the pilot he had radioed a fuel emergency 
but he used less precise language with ground controllers a 
transcript of cockpit talk showed tuesday 
the plane which apparently ran out of fuel crashed jan 25 at 
cove neck long island killing 73 of the 159 people aboard 
including all three cockpit crew members 
tell them we are in emergency said the colombian pilot in 
spanish just after the plane failed its first landing attempt and 
10 minutes before it crashed 
were running out of fuel the copilot told controllers in 
english at 924 pm after the crew of the boeing 707 was 
instructed to abort the attempted landing at john f kennedy 
airport and loop around for another try 
a few seconds later the pilot again asked the copilot to tell 
the controller there was an emergency digale que estamos en 
emergencia the pilot said also asking whether his order had 
been carried out 
si senor ya le dije said the copilot yes sir i 
already advised him according to the transcript and translation 
released by the national transportation safety board 
none of the cockpit crew members was identified by name in the 
transcript the flight had come from bogota and medellin 
a source close to the investigation had told the associated 
press in new york on monday that the transcript appeared to show a 
pilot who did not seem to be in full charge of the flight and who 
did not give specific direction to the copilot to declare an 
emergency 
the 68page transcript of the flights final 40 minutes 
however contained two instances in which the pilot used the 
critical word emergency in communicating with his copilot 
after the crash the federal aviation administration ordered all 
airlines flying to us airports to ensure that their crews use 
specifically worded language in communicating emergencies to 
controllers if a fuel emergency had been declared the plane 
would have been given a higher priority in landing officials said 
board investigators who released the transcript declined to 
evaluate crew performance cause of the crash will be determined by 
the fourmember safety board after the investigation is completed 
in about 10 months 
as air traffic controllers were giving the plane instructions 
for a second approach to the airport the copilot radioed well 
try once again were running out of fuel 
a few seconds later the pilot said i dont know what 
happened with the runway i didnt see it 
both copilots repeated the same thing i didnt see it 
after one instruction from the pilot to advise the controller 
that we dont have fuel the copilot said into the radio 
climb and maintain 3000 and ah were running out of fuel 
sir 
the final eight minutes on the tape contained only one further 
reference to fuel when the new york controller told the plane he 
was going to bring it about 15 miles northeast and then turn it 
back for the final approach 
is that fine with you and your fuel the controller asked 
i guess so thank you very much the copilot radioed 
in the cockpit the pilot asked what did he say 
the third man in the cockpit replied the guy is angry the 
transcript does not make it clear whom he is referring to or why he 
made the statement 
there is also a point about seven minutes before the crash where 
the pilot says a morir or to die but its meaning is not 
clear from the transcript and there is no other statement to 
indicate it was a reference to the imminent crash 
the final minutes of the tape before the crash were undramatic 
full of routine flight instructions except when the third officer 
in the cockpit announced that the no 4 engine had died followed a 
minute later by the no 3 engine leaving only two in operation 
flameout on engine no 3 essential on no 2 on no 1 the 
third crew member said 
the final words in the transcript refer to the instrument 
landing system the tape apparently stopped recording as power 
failed several seconds before impact at 934 pm 
preliminary results of drug tests on the bodies of the pilots 
indicated no use of illegal substances a board source said

brazils two stock markets 
continued to plunge monday in the aftermath of draconian economic 
reforms decreed by new president fernando collor de mello 
in rio the stock market was off by a record 162 percent and 
has now fallen by onethird since collor announced his package mar 
16 
the muchlarger sao paulo exchange dropped by 6 percent monday 
after plunging 49 percent last week 
stock market analysts say the fall on the two exchanges is 
largely due to a lack of money in circulation 
collors economic package designed to cut record inflation of 
73 percent in february included an 18month freeze on assets of 
more than 1200 in private bank savings accounts and 600 on 
shortterm money market deposits the measure took about 115 
billion out of circulation 80 percent of all bank deposits 
stock investors desperate to get their hands on cash are 
selling off shares even at low prices analysts say 
the money squeeze has also created a steep drop in business 
sales and large scale layoffs in some industries with many 
economists saying brazil latin americas most populous with 150 
million residents could soon be mired in a deep recession

massachusetts pushed on two fronts tuesday 
to halt the startup of new hampshires seabrook nuclear power 
plant before summer crowds flock to nearby beaches 
state attorneys argued before a nuclear regulatory commission 
appeal board for a temporary shutdown of the plant at the same 
time the lawyers and other seabrook opponents pushed to have 
federal appeals court judges move up the date of a hearing on the 
case from september to this spring 
were trying to get a hearing before summer said john 
traficonte who is handling the case for massachusetts attorney 
general james shannon that is the time of year when thousands of 
people will be sitting on the beaches 
in tuesdays hearing before the atomic safety and licensing 
appeal board traficonte argued that an error made by plant 
operators during lowpower testing in june warranted a second look 
and that the plants operating license should be suspended in the 
meantime 
plant spokesman ron sher called the latest legal manuvers by 
massachusetts just another effort to delay the operation of 
seabrook station for no good reason 
the fact is seabrook is a safe plant sher said 
massachusetts and other opponents have argued for years that 
seabrook was too close to densely populated coastal areas to allow 
for safe evacuation in a nuclear emergency the nrc rejected those 
arguments march 1 and awarded seabrook an operating license 
the plant already has begun to move toward full power a process 
that will take about three months 
traficonte said one of the most dangerous times in the operation 
of any nuclear plant is the first acceleration to full power under 
the current schedule seabrook will be in its first weeks of 
fullpower operation during the summer when tens of thousands of 
beachgoers flock to nearby resort towns 
on june 22 seabrook operators conducting lowpower testing 
didnt shut down the plant after a valve failure when guidelines 
indicated it should have been shut down the nrc ordered a halt to 
testing and fined seabrook 50000 
traficonte said the nrc made its licensing decision in march 
without resolving the problems that led to the june incident 
sher rejected those arguments 
the power ascension program is a very safe conservative 
program sher said more than 100 plants have gone through the 
power ascension program safely in the united states 
sher said that the problems that led to the june incident have 
been corrected 
the appeal board said it wanted more information from shannons 
office and the seabrook operators and gave both parties up to 17 
days to comply

plo leader yasser arafat said tuesday 
that israels political leaders were stalling over formation of a 
new government in an effort to gain time against the palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
i expected this the palestine liberation organization 
chairman told a news conference from the very beginning they are 
trying to win time 
referring to israels internal political turmoil following a 
noconfidence vote against prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
efforts by the more moderate shimon peres to form a new government 
arafat said to resign or not to resign to go to elections or 
not to go to elections this will continue and in the end we will 
raise our flag the flag of palestine on territory now held by 
israel 
arafat said after the news conference he thought peres who has 
indicated a willingness to begin some sort of dialogue on the 
palestinian question would win the israeli power struggle 
i think he will have a slight majority he said asked if a 
peres victory would make it easier to start talks on the occupied 
territories arafat gave a slight nod but i dont want to say 
anything now he said 
during the halfhour news conference arafat criticized us 
senators who last week adopted a resolution that said jerusalem 
is and should remain the capital of the state of israel 
this is one resolution like other resolutions that the 
congress has been adopting without really studying as they 
should he said 
this is not a challenge for me only this is a challenge for 
president bush also who said israel should not have the right 
to settle new jews in east jerusalem as east jerusalem is occupied 
territory arafat said 
the senate resolution contradicted us policy which says the 
sovereignty of jerusalem should be determined in arabisraeli 
negotiations israel captured east jerusalem from jordan in the 
1967 mideast war and declared the entire holy city its capital the 
united states like most nations maintains its embassy in tel aviv 
arafat said the united states was partly to blame for the flood 
of soviet jews to israel and the possibility of them settling in 
the west bank 
the doors for immigration have been closed for these 
immigrants in america and in other countries he said 
referring to the moslem uprising against indian rule in kashmir 
which is claimed by both predominantly hindu india and islamic 
pakistan arafat said the two countries were friendly neighbors 
who should find a peaceful solution 
he said there was no comparison between kashmir and palestine 
palestine he said was a question of democracy not religion 
arafat flanked by a plo interpreter and an indian foreign 
ministry official spoke from a podium in front of a namecard that 
identified him as the president of the state of palestine 
india was one of the first nonarab nations to recognize the plos 
declaration of palestinian statehood in 1988 the palestinian 
uprising began in december 1987 
the plo chief came to india to receive the jawaharlal nehru 
award for peace and international understanding the award is named 
for indias first prime minister 
during his visit arafat met prime minister vp singh whose 
national front coalition government took office last december and 
with the opposition congress party leader former prime minister 
rajiv gandhi 
on wednesday arafat is to fly to calcutta to meet mother 
teresa winner of the 1979 nobel peace prize in 1982 at the 
height of the israeli siege of west beirut where arafat and his 
guerrillas were trapped the frail roman catholic nun braved the 
war to rescue mentally retarded children from a hospital near the 
front lines

the white house abruptly muted its criticism 
of soviet actions against lithuania on tuesday but still reminded 
moscow that a severe crackdown could damage superpower relations 
we do not want to inflame the situation said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater declining to criticize the 
kremlin for seizing at least 23 army deserters from two hospitals 
in lithuania in a bloody show of force 
we simply dont feel that inflammatory language is helpful 
fitzwater said 
while toning down its public rhetoric the administration was 
privately warning moscow against taking a tough stand officials 
said 
we are letting them know that if they really crack down we 
will react and not just the administration congress could takes 
steps and we might not be able to control the reaction said one 
administration source 
two sources speaking on condition of anonymity said possible 
us responses might be to postpone a superpower summit scheduled 
for june or to delay treaties on nuclear chemical and conventional 
arms that both sides want to sign this year 
however one source said we dont want to do something that 
would punish us as much as the russians a likely first step 
would be suspension of trade talks designed to give moscow most 
favored nation status in commerce with the united states 
asked if soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had violated his 
pledge against using force in lithuania fitzwater replied we 
simply are not going to try to give definition to words like 
force and intimidation 
the restrained us reaction was a sudden change in tone after 
repeated expressions of concern by president bush and others about 
escalating pressure against lithuania which defied moscow and 
declared its independence march 11 
with the planned summit and prospect of arms agreements both 
bush and gorbachev have a huge stake in keeping ussoviet 
relations on an even keel 
appealing for us understanding a soviet diplomat in 
washington defended the seizure of deserters saying every army has 
a right to maintain discipline and contending moscow was not using 
force against lithuania 
even vice president dan quayle admitted the other day there 
should be some discipline in the army said sergei chetverikov 
ministercounselor at the soviet embassy 
on saturday quayle said the soviets should not threaten the 
lithuanians but that there was a certain amount of discipline 
that is absolutely imperative in any armed force 
quayles press secretary david beckwith said tuesday that the 
vice president in no way countenanced the violent rounding up of 
deserters 
former president jimmy carter discussed lithuania with bush 
during an oval office meeting concerning carters recent trip to 
the middle east 
speaking with reporters later in the white house driveway 
carter said president gorbachev faces a quandary is he going to 
let part of the soviet union break off on the one hand at the 
same time how to treat with compassion and understanding the move 
that he himself has precipitated toward democracy toward freedom 
and toward an expression of independence 
he said the united states has played it very well by urging 
a peaceful settlement 
asked if there were a danger that ussoviet progress could be 
undone by tensions over lithuania carter said theres always a 
danger but i dont want to comment on it 
at a rally on the capitol steps organized by the newly formed 
americans for lithuanian independence a crowd of several hundred 
sang lithuanian and american patriotic songs and heard a parade of 
congressmen appeal for swift recognition of lithuania 
we stood by as the tanks rolled into tiananmen square and did 
very little said rep benjamin gilman of new york a senior 
republican on the house foreign affairs committee lets not 
stand by and let there be bloodletting in lithuania 
fitzwater referring to the tense standoff in lithuania said 
this is a very complex delicate diplomatic situation and we will 
continue to treat it as such 
the united states has never recognized the forced incorporation 
of lithuania into the soviet union along with the baltic states of 
estonia and latvia in 1940 
despite lithuanias declaration of independence the united 
states has refused to grant it formal diplomatic recognition 
saying the lithuanians do not control their territory and calling 
on the soviet union and lithuania to negotiate their differences 
fitzwater said any outcome in lithuania other than a peaceful 
one runs a risk of being counterproductive for the soviet union 
itself for ussoviet relations and will have adverse 
international repercussions 
the spokesman said we have made it clear from the beginning 
that the relationship is one of the factors that is at stake and 
that this is a very serious issue that we are watching 
as recently as monday the administration criticized moscow for 
occupying communist party buildings in the capital of vilnius 
fitzwater said then that soviet efforts to intimidate lithuanians 
seemed to have escalated on a daily basis 
on tuesday he declined to say that the seizing of lithuanian 
deserters marked a further escalation i choose not to do it 
today fitzwater said adding that we are worried that our 
comments might be portrayed in such a way as they would be 
unhelpful 
he said we were a little concerned at the way some of my 
words yesterday were played in the media with regard to that 
episode i want to be more careful today 
while refusing to criticize the seizure of deserters fitzwater 
said we view with deep concern the developments of last week and 
yesterday 
he said his comment extends to all events but we are reluctant 
to pick out one or the other to comment on

decades of multinational negotiations have had 
little impact on world trade in farm commodities agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday 
theres no question in my mind that agriculture is the most 
distortive sector of the world economy when one evaluates existing 
trade patterns yeutter told a meeting of the food executives 
international congress 
in the case of industrial goods there has been substantial 
progress in trade liberalization under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade there has been a move under gatt to deal with 
the international aspects of the financial and service sectors 
agriculture has been on the agenda for the past 40 years and 
probably nothing has happened yeutter said weve gone through 
40 years of gatt history through a whole series of multilateral 
trade rounds and for all practical purposes we the members of 
gatt have accomplished nothing in the way of agricultural trade 
liberalization 
the current uruguay round of gatt talks is scheduled to conclude 
at the end of this year 
yeutter said there are all sorts of schemes used to avoid 
trade liberalization and that agricultural commodities are favorite 
targets 
if it exists its applied to agriculture he said if 
theres anything that is distortive you can bet your bottom dollar 
its used by some country somewhere to impede agricultural trade 
those devices he said include export subsidies high internal 
price supports quotas and licensing 
yeutter pointedly used japans restrictive import policy on rice 
as an example 
recently he said a us rice industry group participated in a 
food show in japan and included samples of american rice but the 
japanese government asked that the samples be withdrawn 
i wonder about anyones commitment to trade liberalization 
when we cant even show a sample of an american food product in 
japan yeutter said 
the european economic community for years a favorite target of 
us trade officials also was cited by yeutter for boosting 
internal soybean price supports to more than 18 a bushel the us 
price support was 453 for 1989 soybeans 
i told some of them here recently that if you paid me 18 a 
bushel for soybeans id grow them on the alps and i think maybe 
somebodys going to grow them on the alps if that continues very 
much longer he said 
if you pay farmers enough money theyll grow anything 
anywhere

the national science foundation on tuesday 
announced up to 10 million will be provided to selected states 
with detailed plans to stimulate major improvements in math and 
science education 
foundation director erich bloch said the new science education 
improvement effort supports the goal of president bush and the 
nations governors to make american students first in the world in 
science and mathematics achievement by the year 2000 
to prosper in this world the united states must maintain a 
strong base in science and engineering because that is the basis 
for much of our economic strength said bloch who stressed the 
need for systemic changes in state education programs 
bloch said that the foundation expects in the first year to 
select four to eight states on a competitive basis to participate 
in the program 
we will look for comprehensive plans to improve statewide 
science and mathematics education significantly not simply to 
tinker with the details he said plans will need to deal with 
teacher preparation retention and continuing education with 
curriculum improvements with student motivation and with 
upgrading educational facilities 
bloch said the plans also must include governors state 
legislative leaders chief state school officers teachers 
organizations school administrators unions and parent groups 
industry leaders and presidents of colleges and universities 
noting the numerous studies documenting the poor achievements of 
us students in math and science bloch said we want to move 
beyond studies and beyond planning in the abstract to real 
action 
for the selected states the foundation will make grants 
totaling 5 million to 10 million over the expected life of the 
project bloch said that significant systemic changes must be 
supported through longterm fiscal commitments from state 
legislatures and other sources public and private to assure 
permanence of the reforms begun in the program 
bloch said states must submit preliminary proposals for the 
statewide initiatives program by july 9 with the deadline for 
formal proposals set for oct 15

former president jimmy carter just back from 
a private peaceseeking mission to the middle east said tuesday 
there will be no end to unrest there without an international peace 
conference for the region 
carter who briefed president bush for 35 minutes on his trip 
said he was encouraged about the prospects for peace 
i think that theres a general acceptance now that a 
comprehensive peace is not only necessary but i think inevitable 
he said 
nonetheless carter said it was distressing that the middle east 
is still in turmoil 11 years after he helped negotiate the camp 
david accords between israel and egypt 
carter refused to predict when any kind of negotiations might 
begin in the middle east in part because israel still doesnt have 
a government the united states has long opposed such a 
broadranging manynations conference prefering direct 
negotiations among the states involved 
the israeli coalition government recently fell not long after 
bush stirred controversy by criticizing the settlement of soviet 
jews in east jerusalem 
the united states has been pressing israel to open talks with 
the palestinians of the territories occupied by israel in 1967 and 
egyptian president hosni mubarak has been trying to put together a 
palestinian delegation carter noted 
i think our government ought to use its maximum influence 
not pressure in israel and the other countries as well to go to 
the bargaining table to find peace he said 
there will be no end to the intifada the term used for the 
palestinian uprising against israel until there is an 
international peace conference carter said in remarks at the 
center for strategic and international studies a think tank he 
visited after his trip to the white house 
moreover carter said he believes the intifada was caused by the 
way the israelis have treated palestinians 
the former president said he brought up human rights repeatedly 
in israel complaining about practices such as detaining 
palestinians for 12 months without allowing access to a lawyer 
israelis of all parties have said prospects for talks with 
palestinians were threatened by bushs statement that the united 
states did not want to see additional jewish settlements 
established in the occupied territories including east jerusalem 
past us statements on the subjects have not specifically 
mentioned east jerusalem which israel has annexed 
carter defended bushs statements i think what president bush 
has expressed is a policy thats been our governments for the 
last 23 years 
the us government has for years insisted that the final status 
of east jerusalem could be determined only by negotiations 
carter visited israel egypt syria and jordan on his latest 
trip 
carter played a leading role in monitoring last months 
elections in nicaragua in which sandinista president daniel ortega 
lost to violeta de chamorro he has also tried to mediate a truce 
between factions in ethiopia and the sudan 
the meeting between bush and carter was the first time the two 
had talked since the nicaraguan elections secretary of state james 
a baker iii also attended the meeting with bush and carter 
at the white house carter told reporters bush has reacted well 
to the situation in lithuania where leaders want to break from the 
soviet union 
i think our government has played it very well so far by 
imploring all parties not to resort to force or violence and to 
resolve this in a peaceful fashion said the former president

poor powerless alone and rejected julio 
gonzalez fits the profile of a revenge arsonist an expert said 
tuesday most chilling he said is that such killers rarely 
consider the lives they destroy 
theyre angry against society they feel a need to strike 
out said john barracato a fire investigator and author of a 
book on arson they only want to vent their frustration they 
dont care about the other people 
gonzalez 36 is charged with setting the fire that killed 87 
patrons of an unlicensed social club in the bronx early sunday 
police charge he was angry with his exgirlfriend who worked there 
prosecutors say he has admitted setting the fire in revenge 
while details are lacking accounts portray gonzalez as a quiet 
man who lived lawfully but in poverty since his arrival from cuba a 
decade ago neighbors said nothing foretold the slaughter of which 
he is accused 
but two blows recently shook his life six weeks ago he was 
dismissed from the queens lamp factory where he worked and at 
about the same time he broke up with lydia feliciano with whom he 
had lived for seven or eight years 
gonzalez allegedly argued with ms feliciano early sunday at the 
happy land social club where she was a coat checker a bouncer 
ejected him and prosecutors said he left threatening to shut the 
place down 
police say he bought 1 worth of gasoline splashed it into the 
clubs doorway and ignited it authorities said his shoes reeked of 
gasoline when police arrested him 12 hours later sleeping in his 
10by10 foot 80aweek furnished room 
while barracato could not comment directly about the case he 
said arson for revenge which accounts for about half of all arson 
cases commonly is started with an accelerant such as gasoline and 
is intended as revenge against a perceived offense 
when someone gets locked into an anger stage of emotion he 
wants total destruction said barracato a former deputy chief 
city fire marshal and now director of the fire and fraud section of 
aetna life amp casualty co 
while emotion incites the crime theres no loss of control 
said barracato who conducted a sixyear study of arsonists its 
calculated and its planned they want to assert themselves 
they want power and what can be more powerful than intentionally 
setting a fire 
the greatest question about gonzalezs past is his life in cuba 
which he left in the mariel boatlift that brought 125000 people to 
the united states in 1980 he told authorities he was born in 
holguin in oriente province and worked as a mechanic and 
construction assistant he said his nickname was pochocho a 
diminutive with no meaning 
gonzalez told us immigration officials he had been jailed for 
three years in cuba for an unapproved absence from the army and 
that he had falsely confessed to drug trafficking so cuban 
authorities would let him join the boatlift 
after his arrival he was detained in us camps for nine 
months then released 
us officials have complained that cuba used the boatlift to 
cast off criminals and people with mental problems cuban officials 
in washington did not return telephone calls tuesday seeking 
information on gonzalez 
barracato said many arsonists have no criminal history but they 
often share other attributes poverty low education broken homes 
a lack of idols personal isolation extreme introversion low 
selfesteem 
the underclass status faced by many poor immigrants can 
contribute to the alienation arsonists seem to share barracato 
said the result resentment and if pushed to the brink an urge 
for revenge 
they dont think that by that act theyll kill people he 
said its ill get even with them 
typically when it comes to revenge said barracato he could 
care less about victims

the nations top savings and loan official 
pleaded with congress on tuesday to give president bushs thrift 
bailout program a chance to work before changing or scrapping it 
what we need now is stability constant tinkering even with 
the best of intentions imposes tremendous costs on the industry 
the regulatory system and the american public said salvatore 
martoche acting director of the treasury departments office of 
thrift supervision 
rep frank annunzio dill and his house banking subcommittee 
on financial institutions are reviewing suggestions for changing 
the sampl law enacted nearly eight months ago tuesdays session was 
the third of five scheduled 
proposals range from abolishing the thrift office and dividing 
its duties among commercial bank regulators to providing temporary 
relief from lending rules that some home builders say are crimping 
their credit 
martoche conceded that some changes might improve the law but 
said the benefits were outweighed by the potential harm of 
disruptive changes 
ive been around legislative bodies long enough to know that 
when you do a reopener everything but the kitchen sink gets taken 
up he said 
the sampl law sharply reduced the maximum amount an institution 
can loan to one borrower the intent was to prevent the bankruptcy 
of a single customer from severely hurting a thrift however 
builders complain that they cant get the loans they need and say 
the limit should be phased in gradually 
martoche said the thrift office is leaning toward phasing in the 
restrictions over two years but is uncertain whether the law will 
permit that the agency has given industry lawyers 60 days to 
suggest a creative solution to the dilemma he said 
on another matter martoche said he was not concerned about the 
agencys slow pace in reviewing financial plans submitted by ailing 
thrifts by jan 7 the sampl law required weak institutions to get 
goverment approval for their plans to raise capital 
so far 577 sampls have submitted plans the thrift office has 
rejected 127 approved 64 and told many institutions to go back 
to the drawing board martoche said later tuesday the agency 
announced it was extending its deadline for approving the plans 
from the end of march to the end of april 
i cant help but feel that some institutions were testing us 
to see if lax plans would be approved he said i want them 
agency employees to do the right thing and however long it takes 
it takes 
martoche who is an assistant treasury secretary began the 
thrift job on an acting basis only three weeks ago after m danny 
wall left the position under fire he is already a lame duck 
in response to lawsuits from weak sampls challenging the 
constitutional authority of both wall and martoche president bush 
last week nominated t timothy ryan jr to a fiveyear term as the 
permanent director of the thrift office 
the senate banking committee has scheduled a confirmation 
hearing on wednesday for ryan formerly the top lawyer at the labor 
department from 1981 to 1983 
in another development the federal deposit insurance corp 
approved a controversial plan to pump money into ailing sampls before 
they fail to qualify institutions must be in one of eight 
economically troubled states managers must be subject to firing 
shareholders must be treated approximately as if the sampl had 
failed and new private investment must be injected into the sampl 
along with the government funds 
however it remains unclear if the policy will ever be used 
another agency the treasury departmentled resolution trust corp 
oversight board has expressed reservations the board would have to 
approve any spending for thrift assistance 
i hate the notion of giving shareholders who were responsible 
for running an institution down the tubes any benefit of a 
bailout martoche said i personally find that abhorrent 
several members of the house banking panel also opposed the 
policy including rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a task 
force overseeing the bailout 
fdic chairman l william seidman however says open thrift 
assistance can be cheaper for taxpayers in some cases 
institutions in eight states will be eligible alaska arizona 
arkansas colorado louisiana new mexico oklahoma and texas

six centerright and liberal parties 
advanced to the second round of campaigning tuesday to try to win 
enough support in runoff elections to form hungarys first 
postwar noncommunist government 
janos nemeth chairman of the national electoral committee said 
the final tally in sundays parliamentary elections was delayed 
because the interior ministrys electoral office had given the 
committee incomplete information 
nemeth did not specify whether he thought the interior ministry 
which many hungarians still associate with communist repression 
because of its control of internal security was purposely delaying 
results showing a poor performance by old guard communists 
they refused to join communist reformers in founding the 
socialist party in october and failed to win 4 percent of the 
national vote necessary to gain representation in parliament 
a ministry official who declined to give his name on the 
telephone said the delay in reporting results was due to slow 
transmission of votes from outlying polling stations 
the electoral committee announced unofficial final results but 
said the elections would have to be repeated in five districts 
where fewer than half the eligible voters turned out the state 
news agency mti reported 
the conservative hungarian democratic forum received 247 
percent of the vote to maintain its edge over the centerleft 
league of free democrats who won 214 percent 
the ruralbased independent smallholders finished third with 
117 percent followed by the socialists the successors to 
hungarys communist party with 109 percent 
the league of young democrats won 89 percent and the christian 
democratic peoples party 64 percent 
the rest of the 29 parties that ran did not clear the 4 percent 
hurdle 
more than 70 percent of hungarys 78 million eligible voters 
cast ballots election officials said 
only five of the parliaments 394 seats were decided 
since neither of the two leading parties garnered anything close 
to the absolute majority needed for decisive victory a coalition 
government is likely after runoff elections are held next month 
possibly april 8 
the biggest issue is hungarys economy which is beset by 
doubledigit inflation and a 20 billion foreign debt after four 
decades of communist rule 
the democratic forum and the free democrats both want to move 
toward marketoriented reforms but the forum wants to move more 
slowly 
both parties have said they do not want to join with the other 
in building a coalition government and the independent 
smallholders are expected to play a key role in such a government

the soviet union defended on tuesday its 
seizure of army deserters from two hospitals in lithuania and 
appealed for understanding in the united states of its attempt to 
maintain order in the secessionistminded baltic republic 
deserters are dealt with harshly in other countries as well 
sergei chetverikov ministercounselor at the soviet embassy said 
at a news conference he cited a statement by vice president dan 
quayle as supporting action against deserters 
and yet the soviet official emphasized that moscow while 
defending its authority in vilnius was trying not to use force 
against lithuanians 
the basic premise which is behind the action of the soviet 
government is not to use force not to use intimidation or anything 
of that sort to find peaceful ways peaceful solutions he said 
but the situation is difficult as well all know so we hope 
we will be understood in other countries and in this country as 
well chetverikov said 
he spoke to reporters in a chandeliered reception room 
overlooking washingtons 16th street where some 100 demonstrators 
many of them waving lithuanian flags in a soft breeze shouted 
their protests of the soviet moves in a republic they contend is an 
independent nation 
no more tanks no more tanks they chanted 
their protests could be heard over the soviet officials 
statement and his replies to reporters questions 
in vilnius the capital of the republic the deserters were 
forcibly seized by soviet troops leaving a trail of blood behind 
i dont know how they will be dealt with in this particular 
case chetverikov said but they have been given appropriate 
time to get back to their units and i think this is very 
understandable from the point of view of any commander who is 
dealing with deserters in his own unit 
the soviet diplomat an authority on constitutional law added 
so i dont see this as any indication of the use of force or 
anything of that sort 
in defense of the action chetverikov said even vice president 
quayle admitted the other day there should be some discipline in 
the army 
quayle told reporters in phoenix on saturday that the soviets 
should not threaten lithuania but he said if the soviet union 
is applying disciplinary measures to people in their own military 
thats a different situation 
the vice president added i do not know what kind of 
contractual agreement a member of the soviet army has when he or 
she signs up 
but quayle said there is a certain element of discipline 
that is absolutely imperative in any armed force 
the vice president was on vacation tuesday in hawaii with his 
wife and three children his press secretary david beckwith said 
quayles comment was in the context of urging the soviet union 
and lithuania to resolve the situation through negotiation and 
without any use of force he did state that the desertion question 
was somewhat complicated but he in no way countenanced the violent 
rounding up of deserters 
separately beckwith said in a written statement that soviet 
authorities appear to be broadcasting false reports suggesting 
that quayle endorsed the violent capture of deserters in 
particular he said the tass news agency had published a report 
quoting quayle as saying the soviet union as an annexing power 
has the right to hunt down lithuanian deserters 
chetverikov said he hoped other deserters would return to their 
units 
i dont mean to say other deserters will be hunted down he 
said but the army has the full right to maintain discipline in 
its ranks 
on the secession itself the soviet official said moscow 
recognizes the need for political change in lithuania nobody 
denies the right of selfdetermination he said 
but chetverikov said what the soviet government is opposed 
to is the intention of lithuanian authorities to take over federal 
property that doesnt being to them 
he also questioned that a majority of lithuanians support 
secession from the union

the bush administration began beaming american 
television to cuba on tuesday mtv videos a 1971 world series 
tape and an old kate and allie but the communist government 
jammed the transmissions and accused the united states of 
aggression 
we regret that cuba has refused to permit the free flow of 
information and ideas state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said 
testing of the longplanned tv marti began on channel 13 at 145 
am est in havana viewers saw a test pattern strong and 
clear 
two hours later came videos from mtv dubbed in spanish the 
world series tape the pittsburgh pirates beat the baltimore 
orioles in seven games and an episode of kate and allie the 
longrunning sitcom about two divorced women who share a manhattan 
apartment with their children 
after that viewers saw a report on the success of hispanics 
in this country said jorge mas canosa the chairman of the 
miamibased organization that oversees tv marti 
frank calzon who heads the washington office of freedom house 
a prodemocracy group blasted tv martis show selection 
the programs stink said calzon a cuban exile who is a 
longtime tv marti supporter he said the debut should have 
featured the opening of the berlin wall and the chilean and 
nicaraguan elections 
officials of the voice of america responded that the programming 
was aimed at determining the technical feasibility of the 
transmissions more than influencing cuban public opinion 
while viewers in outlying areas of havana had few problems 
during the fivehour test residents of downtown havana encountered 
the signal of a cuban jamming transmitter after the first 23 
minutes of the test pattern 
mas canosa said castro jammed not just channel 13 but three 
domestic stations as well in case tv marti changed channels 
cuban spokesmen have said they would retaliate beyond the 
jamming but there was no immediate announcement of additional 
measures 
last friday however cuba broadcast a radio speech by president 
fidel castro to the united states am stations along the florida 
coast and as far away as nashville were disrupted 
of tv martis premiere the official cuban news agency prensa 
latina said 
the debut was nothing impressive since in a 10minute interval 
the principal technological power on the planet could not keep the 
invading signal from being rejected over the coverage area 
cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these 
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and washington may 
be looking for a pretext to unleash military aggression 
the cuban government the agency said has placed 
responsibility on the government of that country for all the 
consequences of this action which is aggressive and violates its 
sovereignty 
mas canosa reviewed the first broadcast differently saying that 
several viewers in cuba had phoned relatives in miami to say they 
were very very enthused extremely satisfied and really 
excited 
the station is a tv version of radio marti which has provided 
news and entertainment to cuban listeners since 1985 radio marti 
was not jammed tuesday morning nor did cuba interfere with radio or 
television stations in the united states 
the tv marti signal was sent from an antenna aboard a balloon 
dangling 10000 feet above cudjoe key off the south florida coast 
technical problems have delayed testing for months 
the project has had strong support from conservative elements of 
the cuban exile community who believe that televised exposes about 
the demise of communism around the world will weaken castros rule 
once the testing ends the bush administration has three months 
to make a legal and technical evaluation of the operation 
according to the legislation that authorized the station 
ms tutwiler said international agreements do not prevent a 
country from engaging in television broadcasting to another 
country she also noted that the un universal declaration of 
human rights entitles all people to the freedom to seek receive 
and impart information and ideas through the media 
ariel ricardo a spokesman at the cuban diplomatic mission here 
disagreed with the us position asserting that an international 
agreement reached in 1982 gives each country exclusive control over 
its own television programming 
ricardo said there is no precedent for one country taking 
over a domestic channel of another country he added that in parts 
of the havana area channel 13 is reserved for domestic programming 
according to cuban officials more than 90 percent of cuban 
homes have television the tv marti project is designed mostly for 
the havana area 
in a recent interview with the associated press gary gonzalez 
a vice president of the cuban institute of radio and television 
said us descriptions of cuba as a closed society are misleading 
he said 42 percent of all movies shown on cuban television are 
americanmade there are also a number of usmade programs for 
children shown in cuba

the government on tuesday freed a 
guerrilla leader and 10 of his men arrested by the army after a 
shootout in which two rebels died the rebel chief had come to the 
capital for peace talks 
presidential spokeswoman claudine vermunt said the government 
decided to release former army sgt ronny brunswijk chief of the 
jungle commando rebels and his comrades after discussions with the 
attorney generals office 
earlier tuesday gunmen seized the afobaka hydroelectric dam 125 
miles south of paramaribo in apparent retaliation for the arrests 
power was knocked out briefly to this capital city of 200000 and 
work was disrupted at a nearby aluminum smelter 
although his guerrilla movement denied involvement brunswijk 
issued a message from prison telling the jungle commando such 
action was unnecessary 
the military leveled unspecified drug charges against brunswijk 
relating to jungle commando seizure of 2200 pounds of unrefined 
cocaine from colombia 
brunswijk had said his men confiscated the cocaine sunday from a 
plane flying out of cali colombia that landed because of bad 
weather near a rebel base in the western village of moenjo 
he and his aides were held overnight at fort zeelandia an army 
post in the capital the army had said brunswijk and three aides 
were taken into custody but officials said 11 in all were seized 
two brunswijk bodyguards were killed in a gun battle with 
soldiers during the arrest in the capital no details were 
available 
the rebels who say they represent the bush negro minority had 
been in paramaribo since friday for new talks with government 
officials on ending their 3yearold insurgency bush negroes who 
make up about 10 percent of surinames 400000 residents want 
greater economic development for their region 
a government source speaking on condition of anonomity said 
the military made the arrests without consulting with the 
government the army has shown a growing tendency this year to 
exercise power independent of the government 
lt col desi bouterse the army chief who was the military 
ruler of suriname from 1980 to 1988 opposes a tentative peace 
agreement release last june he complains that it fails to disarm 
the jungle commando which numbers from 200 to 400 members 
bouterse has continued to wield power behind the scenes even though 
the country is under nominal civilian rule 
before the rebels release the jungle commando said in a 
statement that the arrests disrupted the peace process but

president mikhail s gorbachev told the first 
meeting of the new presidential council on tuesday it must start 
figuring out at once how to introduce substantive reforms to 
resurrect the economy 
the council advises gorbachev in the much more powerful 
presidency that he pushed through parliament this month 
almost all 16 council members are newly appointed among those 
who attended tuesday were prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov writer 
chingiz aitmatov and kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov the official 
news agency tass said 
gorbachev told the council its immediate task was to formulate 
specific measures to radicalize the economic reform soviet tv 
reported 
he said later in a television interview that the councils next 
meeting will focus specifically on economic reform 
the economy is foundering as drastic shortages of basic items 
continue ranging from soap to sausage and there continues too to 
be an overabundant money supply and a slump in production in this 
nation of 265 million residents 
an anchorman read gorbachevs lengthy speech instead of its 
being broadcast as it was delivered soviet tv offered no 
explanation 
gorbachev has promised to use his enhanced presidency to 
accelerate the soviet economys transition to a more 
marketoriented setup 
he called for a normal fullfledged market on tuesday for 
eliminating the state budget deficit and for introducing price 
reforms he emphasized the importance of a new law on land meant to 
increase food production by allowing farmers to virtually own their 
plots 
gorbachev made almost no mention of the turmoil in lithuania 
according to the official report of his speech he said only that 
he planned to hold a meeting friday of his other new advisory body 
the federation council which is expected to focus on the 
relationship between moscow and the 15 soviet republics 
life and processes we are encountering in transcaucasia the 
baltic republics especially in lithuania and other regions 
necessitate the urgent examination and settlement of appropriate 
issues he said 
the presidential council is seen as a mechanism to help 
gorbachev transfer political power from the communist party to the 
government

japan once volunteered to give iran and syria 
60 million in economic aid if those countries would use their 
influence to help release american hostages in lebanon a former 
white house official told hearst news service 
the deal to which president reagan reportedly agreed with 
enthusiasm in june 1985 fell through because iran and syria 
rejected the japanese offer on the grounds they had no influence 
over the captors said the former official 
the hearst article appearing at various times in hearst 
newspapers and made available by the service on tuesday did not 
identify the former official 
former japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga came to the white 
house on several occasions to discuss the deal hearst said 
reagans knowledge of japans offer came three months before the 
united states first shipped weapons to iran in what grew into the 
irancontra scandal hearst said 
eight americans are currently held hostage in lebanon but in 
june 1985 there were only six the hostages are thought to be held 
by radical moslem shiites in beirut under the influence of iran 
terry anderson the longestheld american hostage was captured 
on march 16 1985 he was chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press one of the americans william buckley the former 
cia station chief in beirut died in captivity apparently in 1985 
in tokyo an official at the ministry of foreign affairs said it 
would be just impossible for the japanese to have made such an 
offer reagan could not be reached for comment hearst said 
robert mcfarlane the former national security advisor who 
hearst said knew about the offer did not return a telephone call 
his attorney leonard garment was out of the country 
according to the hearst account the japanese offer came about 
in the following fashion 
matsunaga brought the offer to mcfarlane according to the 
former white house official who was present at the meeting 
i am instructed to say that my government would like to be 
helpful and that we are willing to go to both capitals tehran 
and damascus to urge their efforts to release the hostages 
the former official quoted matsunaga as telling mcfarlane 
the ambassador who left washington last year mentioned the 60 
million aid program his government was willing to offer 
matsunaga really wanted to be sure they were going to get 
credit with the president for anything they did the official 
said 
the next day mcfarlane presented the japanese offer to reagan 
the president responded gosh terrific please the former 
us official said 
but the deal was never reached because the japanese were unable 
to persuade the iranians and the syrians to agree to it the 
official said 
it was not clear what japan hoped to get in exchange for tying 
its aid package to the hostages release 
arthur liman the former chief counsel of the joint housesenate 
irancontra committee that investigated the armsforhostages 
scandal said he could not comment because whatever i know on 
this is classified

the house overwhelmingly passed legislation 
tuesday to prevent trucks used to ship food from hauling garbage on 
the return trip 
the legislation which is opposed by the bush administration 
would also require that asbestos infectious waste and other 
healththreatening items be shipped only in vehicles designated for 
that purpose 
the vote was 41015 to send the proposal to the senate where 
similar bills are pending 
the bills prime target is backhauling the practice of 
using trucks that carry food crosscountry to carry municipal 
garbage on the trip home 
backhauling is dangerous disgusting and legal rep william 
clinger rpa one of the measures prime sponsors said during 
the brief floor debate on the legislation 
concern about foodgarbage hauls arose after the centre daily 
times of state college pa reported a year ago that refrigerated 
foodhauling trucks known as reefers were being loaded with 
municipal solid waste 
the report led congress to investigate a related practice 
alternating loads of chemicals with shipments of juice or edible 
oils an oregon truckers shipment log released by a house panel at 
an october hearing included loads of cooking oil wine apple 
juice fire retardant marine lubricant and lime sulphur 
several trucking groups have said that concern by food companies 
has led many truckers to avoid the practice but clinger and rep 
chris smith rnj said checks by their staffs have confirmed 
that backhauling is continuing 
the government says it has not uncovered any instances of 
contamination due to backhauling 
the bush administration has opposed the backhauling ban largely 
because of a provision that the department of transportation would 
assume enforcement responsibility 
alan i roberts a hazardous materials specialist with the 
department told a senate panel three weeks ago that existing law 
is adequate to regulate the handling and transportation of food 
if a bill were approved he said lead responsibility should more 
properly rest with the agencies that have foodsafety expertise 
the agriculture department and the food and drug administration 
the administration has yet to see fit to correct these 
practices said rep tom luken dohio evidently the 
department of transportation thinks it is the problem of the food 
and drug administration the fda thinks its a transportation 
problem and the epa which has jurisdiction over solid waste 
doesnt know what to think 
voting against the bill were reps bill archer rtexas dick

prosecutors on tuesday investigated the tangled 
ownership of the happy land social club to determine whether the 
landlords including actress kathleen turners husband share 
responsibility in the fiery deaths of 87 people 
the district attorneys office also said a grand jury had begun 
hearing evidence against julio gonzalez a 36yearold cuban emigre 
who reportedly confessed to setting the fire at the illegal 
discotheque early sunday 
well have a made case even if he backs out of the 
confession said edward mccarthy spokesman for the bronx 
prosecutors office 
gonzalez allegedly bought 1 worth of gasoline and ignited it in 
the doorway to the twostory unlicensed club after a fight with his 
exgirlfriend who worked there the club had no emergency exits 
and no secondstory windows the victims had neither the time nor 
the means to escape 
the building that housed the club was leased to happy lands 
operator by miss turners husband jay weiss who in turn had 
leased it from one of new yorks major real estate operators alex 
dilorenzo iii 
mccarthy said the issue of landlord responsibility wasnt clear 
prosecutors still had to determine whether anyone beyond the club 
operator elias colon who died in the fire knew the building had 
been served with notices of building code violations 
weiss through a statement by his lawyer roger boyle 
acknowledged that little peach realty a company he owns with 
morris jaffe leased the building in 1985 from a dilorenzo company 
clarendon place corp 
two years later little peach leased the club to colon but 
boyle said that since last spring the company had been trying to 
evict colon for not paying rent the case was to have been heard in 
court wednesday 
boyle said weiss would have no further statement 
miss turner said through her publicist susan geller in los 
angeles this is an act of a violent madman its a tragedy it 
doesnt reflect on me or my husband 
miss turner is in new york starring in a broadway revival of 
cat on a hot tin roof 
according to assistant fire chief william feehan inspectors are 
supposed to serve notices of code violations on the responsible 
person at the scene and not necessarily to building owners 
the happy land tragedy spurred mayor david dinkins to reactivate 
a police fire and buildings department task force formed in the 
wake of another fatal club fire 
fire department spokesman john mulligan said the agency received 
nearly 1000 calls monday the first day of operating a special 
number for reports of illegal social clubs 
mulligan said the names and addresses of some 500 clubs were 
divulged 
the department is elated mulligan said it shows the 
public is aware of the problem now and theres not much you can do 
about it unless the public gets involved 
the man charged with 87 counts of murder gonzalez remained in 
the prison ward of kings county hospital awaiting his next court 
appearance 
according to district attorney robert johnson gonzalez made 
admissions to people he had spoken to after early sundays fire 
the district attorney said gonzalez gave police a videotaped 
confession later in the day in which he admitted he torched the 
happy land with gasoline in a fit of pique against his former 
girlfriend lydia feliciano who worked at the club 
were going to put on the witness stand the girlfriend the 
guy that sold him the gasoline the two guys he talked to the 
neighbors at his house mccarthy said 
and then we have the container that held the gasoline his 
sneakers which were soaked with gasoline we even cut up a hunk of 
the floor and brought it in to prove the burn pattern was caused by 
gasoline 
ms feliciano escaped the fire without serious injury one of 
the four other survivors club disc jockey ruben valladarez was in 
critical but stable condition at jacobi hospital with burns over 30 
percent of this body hospital spokeswoman vicki ciampa said he had 
about a 5050 chance of survival

east german church leaders on tuesday said an 
international commission should investigate charges that some newly 
elected lawmakers had links with the secret police of the ousted 
communist regime 
the chief administrator of east berlins lutheran church 
manfred stolpe was quoted in a tuesday interview as recommending 
that an impartial international commission headed by a former swiss 
president and justice minister kurt furgler investigate the 
allegations 
the charges involve some leaders of noncommunist political 
parties including the top candidate for premier the accusations 
have slowed efforts to form east germanys first freely elected 
government 
in the interview with the bonnbased die welt newspaper stolpe 
said the commission should start its probe after east germanys 
newly elected parliament has been officially constituted in its 
first sitting 
an investigation after the parliaments first session would 
prevent any further delays in setting up the countrys new 
government die welt quoted stolpe as saying 
rainer eppelmann chairman of one of the three parties in the 
alliance that won the countrys first free elections march 18 said 
last week that as many as 40 of the 400 newly elected lawmakers 
might have been agents of the disbanded stasi secret police 
the stasi once had 85000 agents and 109000 informers and 
controlled all walks of life on behalf of the communist government 
outgoing premier hans modrow a reformminded communist 
disbanded the secret police under pressure for change brought on by 
the peaceful revolution 
berlins roman catholic bishop georg sterzinsky said he agreed 
with stolpes recommendation he added that former austrian 
president rudolf kirschschlaeger could be another candidate to head 
the commission 
since the disbanding of the secret police officials have 
debated on how to integrate into society the large number of former 
secret police workers who are finding it difficult to find new 
employment 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble was quoted as 
saying in an interview with the freiburgbased badischer zeitung 
newspaper that a generous amnesty for the former stasi members 
could prevent further instability in east germany 
not everyone who was forced to report to the stasi was a 
criminal schaeuble was quoted as saying 
however exstasi agents involved in capital crimes would 
have to be punished the newspaper quoted schaueble as saying 
lothar de maiziere the chairman of east germanys christian 
democratic union which won the most votes march 18 said he hoped 
the new parliament could convene next tuesday 
de maiziere has been accused of having worked for the secret 
police allegations he denies de maiziere said he hoped to form a 
coalition government by midapril following talks with other 
political parties he is expected to become the premier

the worlds only recipient of a 
heartliverkidney transplant died of kidney failure brought on by 
an unusual form of hepatitis nearly four months after the 
operation a hospital spokeswoman said tuesday 
cindy martin 26 died monday evening at presbyterianuniversity 
hospital said spokeswoman lisa rossi mrs martins family 
including her husband john were with her when she died 
the resident of the scranton suburb of archbald underwent a 
21hour operation dec 23 in which the heart the liver and the 
kidney were transplanted one after another 
mrs martin contracted recurrent nona nonb hepatitis an 
unusual and noncontagious form of the liver disease which resulted 
in kidney failure doctors said 
her condition was further complicated by an overwhelming 
infection called sepsis a common posttransplant complication ms 
rossi said 
infection is a common problem with transplant patients because 
of the use of antirejection drugs which suppress the immune 
system ms rossi said 
since the surgery mrs martins condition never improved beyond 
serious and she often breathed with the aid of a respirator ms 
rossi said last weekend mrs martins condition deteriorated to 
critical 
mrs martin had suffered from familial cardiomyopathy an 
inherited heart disease her father died at age 31 and many 
relatives on his side of the family have died young her husband 
said in december 
on oct 20 1985 one day after getting married mrs martin was 
admitted to presbyterianuniversity to await her first heart 
transplant she received it a month later 
she subsequently developed hepatitis and kidney dysfunction and 
suffered from chronic rejection of the heart which led to the 
multiple transplant the hospital said 
there had been no sign of rejection of the heart since december 
ms rossi said 
multiorgan transplants have been performed several times but 
this was the first involving all three organs said dr john 
armitage who performed mrs martins heart transplant 
doctors plan to perform similar operations should the need arise 
were not recruiting patients with heart liver and kidney 
problems ms rossi said but i would imagine if someone 
presented themselves again who was in critical need of this 
combination of organs we wouldnt hesitate to give them a second 
chance

shimon peres suffered an apparent setback to 
form a new coalition government on tuesday when three leftwing 
parties suspended talks with the labor party leader israel radio 
reported 
the citizens rights movement mapam and shinui parties which 
hold 10 parliament seats said they were postponing coalition talks 
until it becomes clear peres still has a good chance to form a 
government the report said 
peres said he will push for early elections for the 120member 
parliament if he fails to form a new government rather than give 
the rival rightwing likud bloc an opportunity to establish a 
coalition 
earlier in the day politicians from both the left and right 
found themselves in rare agreement when they defended kibbutzim 
following an ultraorthodox rabbis criticism of the secular 
lifestyle of israels communal agricultural settlements 
kibbutzim are held in high esteem in israel for their history of 
settling and defending the country 
but in a speech monday night rabbi eliezer schach the 
93yearold spiritual leader of two small ultraorthodox religious 
parties accused the communal settlements of abandoning judaism 
there are kibbutzim that dont know what yom kippur is or the 
sabbath and they raise nonkosher rabbits and pigs schach 
said do they have any links with their forefathers 
peres praised the kibbutzim which constitute the core of labor 
support but refrained from criticizing schach in an apparent 
effort not to alienate the rabbi 
this is not the sum total of what the kibbutzim have done in 
this country peres said they built the land they settled it 
they spilled their blood for this country 
yossi sarid of the leftist citizens rights movement argued that 
ultraorthodox jews most of whom are exempt from army service 
have done little for israel 
weve already tried the security doctrine of the rabbi schach 
more than once the last time in the holocaust he told israel 
radio alluding to criticism that jews did not defend themselves 
against the world war ii genocide in which 6 million jews were 
killed by nazi germany 
also speaking on israel radio likud hardliner ariel sharon 
stressed that ways must be found for all streams of judaism to 
live side by side in peace 
labor legislator yossi beilin said efforts to bridge the gap 
between religious and secular israelis had been put a step 
backwards of decades by shachs remarks 
schach in his speech before 12000 cheering followers in a tel 
aviv basketball arena also sharply attacked the labor party 
saying it had failed to keep israel on the path of judaism 
labor has severed the link severed itself from the torah 
from the sabbath and the past the rabbi said 
political analysts said schachs remarks made it unlikely that 
the ultraorthodox degel hatorah and shas parties which hold a 
combined eight seats in parliament and are loyal to schach would 
leave the likud camp and join a peresled government 
both labor and likud claim the support of 60 members of 
parliament to break the tie peres needs the backing of one of the 
religious parties to rule the degel torah party has two seats and 
the shas party has six 
if it is true what the commentators are saying we basically 
have to hold new elections peres told israel radio adding he 
would continue his efforts to form a new government 
but caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir head of likud told 
reporters tuesday that he opposed early elections because i 
dont think its healthy for a country to hold elections in such 
short periods of time the last elections were a year and a 
half ago 
the coalition negotiations began after shamir was toppled by a 
noconfidence motion in parliament earlier this month over his 
refusal to accept us mideast peace proposals 
peres has five more weeks to try to put together a coalition if 
he fails president chaim herzog could then ask shamir an option 
labor wants to prevent

a house agriculture subcommittee postponed 
action on a new peanut price support program tuesday after 
closeddoor negotiations between peanut farmers and manufacturers 
failed to produce agreement 
rep charles rose dnc chairman of the tobacco and peanuts 
subcommittee said the panel will try one last time to win the 
support of the manufacturers for the peanut section of the 1990 
farm bill before meeting again wednesday or thursday to write the 
subcommittee version 
rose said the manufacturers have dropped their demand for a 
freeze on the support price for domesticuse peanuts over the 
fiveyear life of the new peanut program but the two sides have 
been unable to reach agreement on other more technical issues 
it seems the socalled concensus has blown up and theyre 
trying to put it back together said john campbell a deputy 
undersecretary of agriculture 
the administration has proposed a 20 percent cut in the support 
price for domesticuse peanuts from 631 a ton for this years 
crop to 504 a ton that proposal wasnt mentioned tuesday as the 
subcommittee worked through a draft bill that would keep the 631 
price support and permit it to increase up to 6 percent a year to 
reflect rising costs of production

62nd academy awards the show drew its smallest audience in three 
years 
according to preliminary ratings figures released tuesday by 
abc the monday night show had a rating of 279 or less than 26 
million us homes with televisions fortyeight percent of all 
television sets in use were tuned to the show according the ac 
nielsen co estimates 
last years muchcriticized oscar show with rob lowe and snow 
white was seen in nearly 27 million homes and 1988s telecast was 
more popular than this years edition too 
the broadcast in 1987 when platoon took the best picture 
trophy was rated lower than mondays show 
highlighting this years oscar presentation were several 
comments critical of the oscar nominating process 
bruce beresford the director of top academy award winner 
driving miss daisy spent oscar night in africa it didnt 
matter because the director wasnt in line for a trophy at the 
awards ceremony here 
not since 1932s grand hotel has the best picture winner 
failed to receive a best director nomination 
the beresford slight and the shutout of spike lees do the 
right thing sparked grumbling into the early morning hours 
tuesday 
lee said miss daisy was chosen over his film because academy 
voters were more comfortable with black chauffeurs than race riots 
miss daisy supporters were at a loss to explain why its 
director was overlooked 
i think it was a bewildering thing that will never be known 
said miss daisy coproducer richard zanuck backstage after the 
film was selected best picture he had his stamp on this film 
why he wasnt nominated well never know 
some of those who worked on the civil war epic glory 
complained too that their film should have been nominated for 
best picture and best director glory won three trophies 
including best supporting actor to denzel washington 
early in the show presenter kim basinger introduced the first 
of the best picture nominees 
we have five great films here miss basinger said and 
they are great for one reason they tell the truth 
but there is one film missing from this list that deserves to 
be honored because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of 
all and thats do the right thing 
her remarks were met with sustained applause as she thrust 
clenched fists into the air shouting yes yes 
television critics were mostly kind in their reviews of the 
show some said it was too conventional the broadcast ran 3 hours 
34 minutes and was marred by an echofilled satellite feed from 
moscow live segments also were shown from london tokyo australia 
and buenos aires argentina designed to show that the film 
industry is international 
it was the longest show since 1984s program which ran 42 
minutes over 3 hours

senate leaders won approval tuesday night to 
limit debate on clean air legislation and scheduled a final vote on 
the complex and controversial bill within a week 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said a final 
vote on the bill would be held at 8 pm next tuesday the bill 
the product of lenghty private negotiations with the white house 
has been under debate for three weeks 
the announcement by mitchell came after the senate grappled most 
of the day with a proposal that would ease air pollution permit 
requirements which industry had complained would create a 
bureaucratic nightmare 
the issue has closely divided the senators who first voted 5047 
to refuse to set the weakening amendment aside and then rejected 
the proposal in a second vote also 5047 
the clean air bill the first tightening of federal air 
pollution laws in 13 years calls for a wide range of new pollution 
controls on industry automobiles and electric power plants in 
hopes of bringing air quality within federal standards in most 
urban areas by the turn of the century 
mitchell outlined his plans for the legislation after 
discussions with the minority leader sen bob dole rkan with 
sen robert byrd dwva whose proposal for financial assistance 
for coal miners at times has held up progress and with the floor 
managers of the bill 
the majority leader then requested and obtained unanimous 
consent from his colleagues to limit further debate on the measure 
and set the time for a final vote 
meanwhile behindthescene discussions continued in an attempt 
to work out an agreement with byrd over the coal miner assistance 
the white house has opposed the measure vigorously as being too 
expensive and senate leaders were attempting to persuade byrd to 
agree to a less costly compromise 
mitchell said the byrd proposal would be set aside until 
thursday when it would be brought to a vote the measure calls for 
500 million in assistance over three years to miners who lose 
their jobs because of controls on emission of sulfur dioxide from 
coalfired electric power plants 
the permit requirements in the clean air bill occupied the 
senate most of the day tuesay 
sen don nickels rokla had sought an amendment he said would 
streamline the permit process arguing that the current legislation 
spells economic disasters for thousands of businesses and would 
create a bureaucratic nightmare for businessmen 
but critics said the changes sought by nickels would allow 
polluters in some cases to avoid some parts of the new law and 
hinder federal enforcement it also would allow some polluters to 
tie cases up in lengthy litigation and inhibit citizen lawsuits 
seeking enforcement of pollution controls the opponents maintained 
about 35 states already have laws requiring such permits under 
the bill the epa would have broader authority to review state 
permits

fifth communist party building in vilnius the capital 
washington and other foreign governments urged restraint but 
avoided attacking soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who faces 
growing independence movements in several republics as he tries to 
institute reform 
the bush administration in declining to denounce moscow said 
it did not want to inflame the situation 
soviet officials defended their actions and condemned the 
lithuanians aspirations as dangerous 
even vice president quayle admitted the other day there should 
be some discipline in the army sergei chetverikov 
ministercounselor at the soviet embassy said at a news conference 
in washington 
quayle said saturday the soviets should not threaten lithuania 
but added that if the soviet union is applying disciplinary 
measures to people in their own military thats a different 
situation 
in a furious letter to gorbachev lithuanias president 
vytautas landsbergis and prime minister kazimera prunskiene said 
their government demands the return of its kidnapped citizens 
they also urged negotiations with moscow in neutral territory 
both landsbergis and prunskiene said gorbachev had refused their 
calls 
soviet soldiers stormed two hospitals before dawn tuesday and 
seized 23 lithuanian deserters who had sought refuge the official 
tass news agency said lithuanian television said two genuine 
mental patients were accidentally seized but that the soldiers let 
them go later 
witnesses said some deserters were beaten as they were taken 
from a rundown psychiatric hospital in vilnius a trail of blood 
led down the steps and out the front door of the hospital 
they beat them with their fists said a duty nurse at the 
hospital where windows and iron beds were broken 
gorbachev has called lithuanias independence declaration 
invalid and last week ordered lithuanians to turn in their weapons 
and stop signing up with a volunteer militia 
he had promised not to use force unless lives were endangered in 
the baltic republic which the soviet union forcibly annexed along 
with latvia and estonia in 1940 but military authorities had 
warned lithuania they would use force to capture deserters if the 
men had not returned voluntarily by last saturday 
in addition to storming the hospitals soviet troops tuesday 
took over the communist party headquarters in the center of 
vilnius it was the fifth party building soviet forces have seized 
in the republic since the weekend 
vladislav shved a leader of the lithuanian communist party 
faction loyal to moscow indicated on the nightly news program 
vremya that the troops were acting directly on the factions

of europe and the rest of the world but did not elaborate 
a declaration read at the briefing in the soviet embassy 
building tuesday said the aspirations of the lithuanian 
leadership to speedily separate from the other nations appear 
unjustified and lets say frankly dangerous 
it said the situation had taken on a sharp character 
recently and warned that the position of lithuanias leaders could 
have a negative effect on the course of perestroika the name 
gorbachev gave his program of reform 
there was little response in moscow to the turmoil gorbachev 
spoke for several minutes on soviet tv tuesday evening about the 
first meeting of his new presidential council an advisory body he 
never mentioned lithuania 
the afternoon news carried nothing about the situation the 
evening news had only a brief report focusing on the communist 
party members in lithuania still loyal to their parent party in 
moscow 
the soviet embassy in washington defended the seizure of army 
deserters and appealed for international understanding 
deserters are dealt with harshly in other countries as well 
chetverikov said 
outside about 100 demonstrators many of them waving lithuanian 
flags protested the soviet actions no more tanks no more 
tanks they chanted loudly enough for chetverikov to hear 
the expulsion order announced tuesday affected foreign 
journalists businessmen and diplomats said foreign ministry 
spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
foreigners have been asked to leave the borders of lithuania 
and temporarily refrain from entering its territory gremitskikh

paris on tuesday he expected the crisis to be defused in a 
peaceful way but he said lithuanian deserters had to be returned 
to their units

drafted into an army of occupation and deserters have said they 
were beaten before they left the army

a federal judge temporarily banned 
construction of a major observatory atop an isolated mountain where 
180 endangered squirrels live an environmentalist praised the 
decision but an astronomer called it a tragedy for us 
astronomy 
a university of arizona official said tuesday that the school 
would appeal the injunction granted by us district judge alfredo 
c marquez 
the order issued monday imposes a fourmonth ban on construction 
of the planned 200 million mount graham international observatory 
on a 10700foothigh peak of the mountain 
the university was ready to begin building the first two of at 
least three telescopes in what could become the worlds most 
powerful observatory 
congress had authorized the project on us forest service land 
but did not provide any money 
the remote mountaintop is home to an estimated 180 endangered 
mount graham red squirrels construction opponents sought the 
building ban fearing extinction of the halfpound rodents 
michael a cusanovich the universitys vice president for 
research said tuesday that construction would have no impact on 
the squirrel and that the school would appeal the injunction to the 
9th us circuit court of appeals 
i dont know what he decided it on im telling you i dont 
think it was decided on facts said cusanovich who added that 
given the congressional approval delaying tactics are 
inappropriate and are in fact damaging to society 
the judge said serious questions had been raised over whether 
the construction would cause irreparable harm to the mount graham 
red squirrel 
im surprised im encouraged robin silver a spokesman for 
the maricopa county audubon society in phoenix said monday this 
has been a tough process all along im encouraged that the system 
can still work 
i think its a tragedy for us astronomy said roger roger 
angel head of the universitys steward observatory mirror lab and 
developer of a revolutionary process for fabricating large 
telescope mirrors in times of very poor funding were working 
like crazy to try to keep our heritage of good astronomy 
while several european countries have financed development of 
new telescopes angel said there has been no such commitment from 
the federal government 
project plans call for the columbus project construction of the 
worlds most powerful single telescope to get underway by the 
mid1990s the telescope would have two 8meter mirrors giving it 
a combined viewing field equal to an instrument with a mirror 37 
feet in diameter that would be five to six times the 
lightgathering power of the 5meter mount palomar in california 
considered the worlds most powerful 
with the columbus project as the biggest single telescope 
were right on the track of keeping that in the united states 
angel said i dont know how long we can keep collaborators 
together without a site for the telescope 
mount graham in the pinaleno mountains in southeastern arizona 
is the only known habitat for the 180 remaining squirrels 
in 1988 the us fish and wildlife service concluded in a 
biological report for the forest service that the telescopes could 
coexist with the squirrel arizonas congressional delegation then 
pushed through the legislation ordering the forest service to grant 
the university a construction permit 
but environmental groups sued contending that perching the 
telescopes on an 86acre site on one of mount grahams three peaks 
would assure the extinction of the 8ounce squirrels by taking away 
more of the forested land they need to survive 
university officials contend poor pine cone crops in recent 
years have hurt the squirrel population they said hunting 
logging use of offroad vehicles and christmas treecutting have 
been stopped because of the planned observatory and that 60 to 80 
acres will be reforested

un officials shrugged off on tuesday the 
rev jesse jacksons threat to take the case for district of 
columbia statehood to the united nations 
the un does not grant statehood to states which are members 
of federations or independent states francois giuliani 
spokesman for the secretarygeneral said tuesday in answer to a 
question he said it is not for the united nations to confer 
statehood but only to consider membership 
he noted that un membership is achieved through a process that 
includes recommendation by the 15member security council where 
the united states has veto power and by a twothirds vote of the 
159nation general assembly 
jackson said monday he may appeal to the united nations as a 
last resort in his attempt to win statehood for the district he 
complained that the region was denied basic human rights and 
political representation and claimed the district was under 
political occupation 
lithuania tibet and other regions of un member states all 
have failed so far to achieve un recognition or often even to 
win un comment on their independence movements involving the 
soviet union china and other countries 
un judicial experts considered the district of columbia as one 
more such case an internal issue for the united states to resolve 
the united nations frequently shuns touchy political issues 
ranging from the use of poison gas to repression of political 
dissidents 
in washington meanwhile the city council voted 121 tuesday to 
hold elections for a shadow congressional delegation that would 
press the citys quest for statehood on capitol hill 
the councils vote to hold a september primary and a november 
general election balloting for the posts comes after three separate 
votes in recent years to postpone the elections

the national transportation safety board on 
tuesday called for utilities to install new equipment to help 
prevent explosions and fires from leaking pipes that supply natural 
gas to homes 
the board recommended urgent action by the department of 
transportation to require the devices called excess flow valves 
on some residential gas lines 
in addition the board encouraged the utility industry to 
voluntarily provide customers with the opportunity to buy the 
equipment and have it installed 
the recommendations were issued as part of a report that 
concluded that the devices could have helped prevent fatal natural 
gas accidents in kansas and missouri the valves automatically 
restrict the flow of gas when certain increases occur possibly 
from a leak or rupture in the line 
four people were killed and a dozen injured in a series of five 
explosions between september 1988 and march 1989 on kpl gas service 
lines in the two states 
in its report the ntsb faulted the kansasbased utility for 
inadequate training of inspectors and a poor system for identifying 
steel and cast iron lines that could be particularly prone to 
corrosion and leaks 
however james l kolstad the board chairman said the kpl 
accidents reflect problems found throughout the gas utility 
industry 
we dont think this is an isolated case said kolstad 
for instance the board said gas utilities needed to do a better 
job of alerting the public to the dangers of leaks and advising 
customers what to do when they smell gas odors 
the ntsb also recommended that federal pipeline safety standards 
be extended to all portions of gas lines running to customer homes 
from main supply lines currently the regulatory protections 
including requirements for corrosion protection and inspections 
cover only service lines to a customers meter from the main line 
socalled yard lines which go from the meter to the house are 
the responsiblity of homeowners and utilities have no obligation to 
inspect or maintain them 
the fivemember board recommended that dot change its 
regulations to extend the safety standards and said utilities 
should be required to install the excess flow valves on new high 
pressure residential service lines and those being replaced 
recommendations of the ntsb which operates as an independent 
agency are not binding but can serve as a catalyst for actions by 
regulators the industry or congress 
board members noted that they had suggested the use of excess 
flow valves in 1981 but that no government mandate had been issued 
dot will consider the boards recommendations according to mark 
dowis executive assistant to the administrator of the research and 
special programs administration 
were going to take it very seriously he said 
the agency did not pursue ntsbs earlier recommendation for 
excess flow valves because of a gas industry study that cast doubts 
on their usefulness he said 
carl ericson a spokesman for the american gas association said 
the industry would consider the ntsb recommendations in the past 
he said there have been questions about the costs and 
effectiveness of the devices particularly on low pressure gas 
lines that often serve residential customers 
several of the accidents in kansas and missouri involved bare 
steel service lines installed before 1971 when federal safety 
requirements took effect to make utilities responsible for 
installing corrosion prevention systems and for inspecting for gas 
leaks on the pipes owned by customers 
ntsb recommended that dot require utilities to safeguard all 
currently unprotected gas lines over several years either through 
replacement of the lines or some corrosion protection system

cuba protested the start of us television 
transmissions to the communist island nation tuesday as illegal and 
a possible prelude to us military action against fidel castros 
government 
cuban jamming limited the first test transmission of tv marti to 
10 minutes prensa latina said 
however reports from washington said the jamming began 23 
minutes into the transmission in downtown havana and that viewers 
in outlying areas had few problems during the fivehour test 
cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these 
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and washington may 
be looking for a pretext to unleash military aggression the 
cuban government news agency prensa latina said 
in panama the commander of us military forces in latin 
america said the united states doesnt have to do anything to get 
rid of castro because the cuban people will 
we dont have the slightest intention of invading castro right 
now there is no need to gen marc cisneros told the associated 
press his own people are going to do to him what 
panamanians did to deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega 
cisneros was asked to comment on castros claim that 500000 
us soldiers would die if the united states tried to invade cuba 
hes a clown cisneros said castro is smoking marijuana 
on this point 
prensa latina monitored in mexico city suggested that the 
danger of an air wave war escalating to armed confrontation could 
be behind stepped up cuban militia drills 
division gen ulises rosales del toro the cuban armed forces 
chief of staff said his men are ready to defend cuba against a 
us invasion 
we have high moral and a combative mood in our armed forces 
sufficient equipment and the will to defend our revolution and our 
country he said according to prensa latina 
the foreign ministry said the bush administration is on a 
course ever more aggressive and hostile towards the cuban 
revolution 
it said the administration had been emboldened by the changes 
in eastern europe the election results in nicaragua and a pyrrhic 
victory in panama that massacred thousands of its sons 
the united states which invaded panama in december to oust 
noriega must realize its actions are capable of provoking a 
crisis of great proportions in this part of the world said vice 
foreign minister oscar oramas 
the tv marti transmission test included music a 1971 world 
series tape and an episode of kate and allie a comedy series 
about two divorced women and their children 
for the united states the debut was nothing impressive since 
in a 10minute interval the principal technological power on the 
planet could not keep the invading signal from being rejected over 
the coverage area prensa latina said 
it said residents called local radio stations in outrage over 
the miserable and cowardly aggression 
the authorities base their rejection of the transmissions not 
only on the subversive character of their content but on their 
illegality and above all on the occupation of a locally used 
frequency within the sovereignty of cuban national territory the 
news agency said 
it said channel 13 used for the tv marti transmission is a 
domestic channel used by tele rebelde 
prensa latina said the transmission violates the un charter 
conventions on the use of communications satellites and other 
international agreements 
it also protested use of the name of cuban hero jose marti for 
the transmission 
cuba has denounced the transmissions before the 
interparliamentary telecommunications union the nonaligned 
movement the un security council and other international bodies 
the agency said

the shuttle mission to propel the 
15 billion hubble space telescope into orbit may be moved up a 
day or two but nasa said tuesday that crews still face some bugs 
insects 
the telescope is to be transferred into discoverys payload bay 
no earlier than thursday two days later than scheduled because of 
gnatlike insects in a payload preparation room nasa earlier gave 
wednesday as the earliest transfer time 
still nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said technicians needed 
little if any of the contingency time built into discoverys 
prelaunch schedule making it possible for the agency to take the 
unusual step of moving up the launch date 
the processing has gone very smoothly said dick young a 
spokesman for the agency 
nasa occasionally has moved around shuttle launch dates on the 
manifest because of scheduling changes in the months prior to 
liftoff young said but it is the first time liftoff has been 
accelerated once orbiter processing has begun 
the national aeronautics and space administrations flight 
readiness review board will finalize the launch date after meeting

malev the hungarian airline announced 
tuesday the indefinite suspension of flights to beirut less than a 
week after halting flights of soviet jews to israel because of 
threats from moslem extremists 
a spokesman for the state carrier denied the decisions were 
related 
the measure came 10 days after flights to the lebanese capital 
resumed following a fiveyear lapse the government news agency mti 
reported the spokesman for the governmentowned airline told mti 
the suspension was due to a lack of security in lebanese airspace 
mti quoted the unidentified malev spokesman as saying the 
suspension of flights to beirut would be in effect until further 
notice 
he said it was unrelated to its move wednesday to halt flights 
of soviet jews to israel a decision hungarian government leaders 
have criticized saying it was made by airline officials who did 
not consult with the government 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine issued threats 
against airlines of all those countries that provide such flights 
hundreds of thousands of jews are expected to emigrate to israel 
in the next few years as the result of relaxed rules in the soviet 
union and tighter entry quotas in the united states 
the exodus has sparked an uproar in the arab world which fears 
many of the newcomers could settle in the israelioccupied 
territories especially the west bank 
the soviet airline aeroflot does not run direct flights to 
israel instead migrants must change at one of several transit 
points including budapest

senior un officials said tuesday 
that the millions of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran should 
return home and begin rebuilding their wartorn nation 
it is clear that somehow weve got to help feed them in 1990 
but this cant go on forever world food program executive 
director james ingram told reporters 
sadruddin aga khan the un coordinator for humanitarian aid 
and thorvald stoltenberg the un high commissioner for refugees 
also attended the news conference 
ingram said the afghan civil war between the marxist government 
and moslem guerrillas has lasted for 10 or 11 years already and 
now there is an opportunity to make progress in the return of 
refugees 
about 38 million afghans live in a maze of refugee camps 
scattered along pakistans border another 2 million live in iran 
while insisting the refugees must go home voluntary sadruddin 
said the united nations hoped that rebuilding their destroyed 
country might be the catalyst to spark their return 
most of the refugees fled after soviet soldiers marched into 
afghanistan in 1979 to replace one communist government with 
another and to crush the moslem insurgency 
moscow withdrew the last of its troops in february 1989 but 
most refugees have stayed in pakistan while the war continues 
between the usbacked guerrillas and the sovietsupported 
government in kabul 
sadruddin has made fresh appeals for contributions toward his 
12 billion repatriation plan the money is to be used to rebuild 
afghanistan where the war has ruined the economy wiped out herds 
and farmlands and destroyed thousands of villages 
sadruddin has suggested the refugees return to parts of 
afghanistan where there has been little or no fighting in recent 
months these areas would be designated peace zones 
he said renewed fighting instigated by either the kabul 
government or the guerrillas would end un assistance 
the price to pay will be no un aid said sadruddin 
who returned tuesday from a daylong trip to kabul 
however afghan and western sources fear another round of 
fighting will begin once the snow melts and weapons can be ferried 
from pakistan across the rugged mountain passes to afghan cities

halston the designer who created the 
pillbox hat that jacqueline kennedy made chic and whose 
starstudded circle of friends included andy warhol and liza 
minnelli has died of aidsrelated cancer he was 57 
he died in his sleep at pacific presbyterian medical center 
monday night his brother robert frowick said tuesday that 
halston had suffered from aids for the last 18 months and died of a 
related cancer called kaposis sarcoma 
halston asked his family to auction an allblack rollsroyce 
dream car he bought for more than 200000 last year and to 
donate the proceeds to aids research frowick told a news 
conference at the hospital attended by his brother donald and 
sister susan watkins 
halston spent some of his final days touring the california 
coastline especially big sur in the rollsroyce frowick said 
known worldwide for his simple and sexy creations halston 
designed clothes for such celebrities as lauren bacall minnelli 
and bianca jagger bacall dubbed him halstie baby and once 
ordered 75 outfits priced at 200 to 1000 each 
through his work he became friends with warhol and other 
celebrities including model marissa berenson 
the toprated designer was responsible for the pillbox hat that 
mrs kennedy wore at her husbands presidential inauguration in 
1961 the hats became popular with millions of women 
he later pioneered the use of ultrasuede a synthetic fabric 
much like suede 
the halston label on a dress or perfume tells a woman that 
what shes buying will be recognized as right vogue magazine 
once said that its more than just stylish its in good taste 
born roy halston frowick on april 23 1932 in des moines iowa 
he attended indiana university and the chicago art institute said 
to have been fascinated with his grandmothers hats as a child he 
began making hats while still in college 
his first client was fran allison of kukla fran and ollie 
and within months he was creating hats for kim novak hedda hopper 
deborah kerr and shirley booth 
he moved to new york city in 1957 working in lily daches hat 
division the next year he went to work for bergdorf goodman 
department store as a milliner and later began designing 
bergdorfs readytowear fashions he opened his own couture house 
in 1968 
he was temperamental spoiled always threatening to quit 
andrew goodman bergdorfs president said in 1973 but we 
indulged him because he was so talented 
halston added a readytowear range called halston 
international in 1970 and halston originals in 1972 
but halstons position at the pinnacle of the fashion industry 
began to slip dramatically in 1973 when he signed a 16 million 
deal with norton simon inc for his readytowear line his couture 
operation and the halston trademark 
the agreement let norton simon use the halston name for products 
the designer didnt design and halston couldnt use his name on 
any product without norton simons permission 
jc penney co inc approached norton simon with the idea of a 
line of inexpensive halston clothes to be sold exclusively in the 
moderateprice department stores and halston agreed that deal was 
signed in 1982 
shortly after that bergdorf goodman announced it would no 
longer sell halston clothes because of the association with 
penneys adding to the designers woes norton simon was acquired 
at the same time in a takeover with the esmark inc conglomerate 
which in turn was taken over by the beatrice companies 
to cut costs beatrice eliminated halstons limousines 
dismissed much of his staff and disassembled his company 
revlon group inc in new york bought the halston name in 
december 1986 they used it on a popular fragrance line called 
simply halston 
we are all deeply saddened by halstons death said ronald 
perelman revlons chairman of the board he was an american 
leader of design and style who helped to define his entire era he 
will be sorely missed 
halston won coty fashion awards in 1962 and 1969 and was 
elected to the fashion hall of fame in 1974 
halston had effectively retired by the fall of 1988 and was 
diagnosed with the aids virus about a year ago frowick said at the 
news conference the designer moved to california in december 
there really isnt much to celebrate he was quoted as 
saying when asked about his increasingly sedate lifestyle people 
are always asking what happened how are you 
it can be very difficult he said i have no answer 
after he was hospitalized his family brought him gourmet meals 
approved by his doctor his brother said halston enjoyed a 
breathtaking view of the golden gate bridge and san francisco bay 
area from his hospital room which was filled with orchids and 
other flowers 
he was quite lucid up until the last few days frowick said 
when he was alert he was extremely alert and he had very 
strong mental faculties that never left him 
frowick described his brother as an extremely elegant man 
thats the way he tried to go through his final stages too 
in a statement issued earlier in the day frowick said the 
family mourns the loss of a magnificent and deeply respected 
brother and friend 
we thank all those from around the world who have been 
communicating thoughtful wishes to him america has lost a true 
patriot and its greatest designer one of the greatest designers in 
the world 
a memorial service is planned friday at calvary presbyterian

well the second act set a craggy mountain of 
rocks made to suggest a hilltop in upstate new york was nice 
but the play making movies which opened tuesday at 
offbroadways promenade theater is a mistake a flat 
unconvincing comedy that stymies director don scardino and a cast 
of usually competent actors 
it was written by aaron sorkin who scored on broadway earlier 
this season with a few good men a military courtroom drama 
starring tom hulce 
there are similiarities between the two works both have 
wisecracking heroes in making movies its a screenwriter 
trying to make up with his girlfriend who happens to be a producer 
of the movie she wants him to do rewrites on the script in a 
few good men its a navy lawyer who defends two marines accused 
of murder 
scardino directed both plays he gave a few good men a 
crackerjack production fastpaced and occasionally funny but with 
making movies desperation has set in the actors push too hard 
intensity is the order of the day 
and theres not too much material to get worked up about 
besides fighting with his girlfriend the screenwriter must contend 
with the director an old college friend who has visions of making 
a great military epic set in guam why they are filming on a farm 
outside schenectady ny is never made entirely clear 
the dialogue tries for trendy but ends up turgid there are a 
great many jokes in the second act about three cows who happen to 
wander into the final day of shooting some are funny 
making movies will not inspire anyone to go into the film 
business animal husbandry maybe but not show business

arab and nonarab countries said tuesday 
during a security council session that the settlement of soviet 
jews in the israelioccupied territories threatens peace in the 
middle east 
on wednesday the security council plans to meet again to 
continue discussions on the controversial issue of soviet 
emigration to the occupied lands 
hundreds of thousands of jews are expected to emigrate to israel 
in the next few years as the result of relaxed rules in the soviet 
union and tighter entry quotas in the united states 
the exodus has sparked an uproar in the arab world which fears 
many of the newcomers could settle in the occupied territories 
especially the west bank israel says it has no policy of settling 
the immigrants in the occupied territories 
egypts permanent representative to the united nations said the 
international community is dutybound to safeguard the endeavors 
for peace in the middle east at this critical stage in the 
process 
the representative amre moussa said egypt believes that 
immigration to israel coupled with settling israeli civilians or 
immigrants in the occupied territories constitutes a serious 
threat to middle east peace prospects 
moussa called on the united states and the soviet union to 
ensure that the rights of the palestinian people shall not be 
jeopardized 
we must not allow anyone to waste this unique opportunity to 
achieve tangible progress toward a reconciliation between the 
jewish and palestinian nations moussa said 
syrian representative issa awad criticized israel and the united 
states for supporting policies that he said lead to the herding 
of these immigrants like cattle to israel against all values 
espoused by the united states 
chinese ambassador li luye said jewish settlement in the 
occupied lands aggravated the already tense situation in the 
middle east and posed new barriers to the peace process in the 
region 
li said china one of five permanent members of the security 
council would continue to work for measures to safeguard the 
rights of palestinians 
the 15member security council originally took up the issue of 
soviet jewish emigration to the west bank and gaza on march 15 but 
adjourned without taking action

governors horned in on us foreign policy 
when they tried to stop state national guard units from training in 
central america the bush administration told the supreme court on 
tuesday 
solicitor general kenneth starr asked the court to squelch 
minnesota gov rudy perpichs challenge of a 1986 law that strips 
all governors of their veto power over national guard training 
missions 
what the governor has sought to do is to play a role in the 
foreign policy and defense policy of the united states said 
starr the justice departments highestranking courtroom lawyer 
the case has revived a controversy from the 1988 presidential 
campaign in which democratic candidate michael dukakis denounced 
the reagan administration for what he called a failed and 
illegal policy of supporting the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the massachusetts governor said that sending national guard 
troops to the region was an attempt to intimidate nicaragua 
dukakis unsuccessfully challenged the same 1986 law a lawsuit 
government lawyers called a dagger aimed at the heart of national 
defense 
perpich alleges in his lawsuit against the defense department 
that the constitution gives states the authority to direct or 
consent to peacetime training of state militia 
rather than attack us policy in central america perpich has 
portrayed the dispute as a states rights fight 
a supreme court decision is expected by july 
john tunheim chief deputy attorney general for minnesota 
argued tuesday that the founding fathers created state militia 
because they greatly feared the effect of a large standing army 
they believed that state control would be a very important 
check on the federal government tunheim said 
but justice anthony kennedy asked how the federal government 
could properly prepare national guard units for battle without 
having the unfettered authority to decide where they are trained 
in minnesotas view kennedy said were in a position where 
we cant train them to do some of the things were calling them 
forth to do 
the 1986 law known as the montgomery amendment barred any 
governor from stopping a national guard unit from serving on active 
duty outside the country over disagreement with the missions 
location purpose or schedule 
named for rep gv sonny montgomery the mississippi 
democrat who sponsored it the law was enacted after several 
governors said they opposed the reagan administrations central 
american policy 
ruling on minnesotas challenge the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals upheld the law in june 
urging the justices to do the same starr noted that national 
guard troops are enlisted in the us armed forces as well as in a 
state organization therefore he said the president may order 
them to train anywhere he sees fit 
they wear two hats starr said when they were going to 
honduras they were wearing their federal hat 
the national guard has been under dual state and federal control 
since congress made it a component of the army in 1933 enlistees 
enroll simultaneously in the state militia and a reserve unit of 
the us armed forces 
the dualenlistment system worked very well until governors 
decided to play a role on the stage of foreign policy starr said 
twentynine states filed a brief siding with the federal 
government and saying that perpich was seeking to arrogate to 
himself a role in foreign affairs 
six other states iowa maine massachusetts montana ohio and 
vermont took minnesotas side arguing that the constitution 
grants state control of the militia to prevent abuses by the 
federal government 
montana later withdrew its support of minnesota said gary 
blair adjutant general of the montana national guard on tuesday 
the army national guard provides 46 percent of the armys combat 
units and 28 percent of its support forces 
the air national guard provides 73 percent of the nations 
interceptor forces 25 percent of the tactical fighter aircraft and 
24 percent of tactical air support

suppressed when it seized power that september

a man who was in a vegetative state for 
eight years unexpectedly woke up and started talking after 
being given a tranquilizer for routine dental work a neurologist 
said tuesday 
i have to tell you he was a different man he knew his name 
the name of his family where he used to work he could add 
subtract and perform complicated calculations dr andres kanner 
said in an interview 
the man identified only as a wisconsin man in his mid40s 
revived after being given valium at the university of wisconsin 
hospital and clinics on march 12 kanner said 
the man who was injured in a traffic accident 10 years ago was 
not in a coma but a vegetative state meaning his eyes were open 
and he occasionally uttered words but could do nothing else the 
doctor said 
after the tranquilizer was administered for the march 12 dental 
work the man fell asleep for about five minutes kanner said 
then he woke up and started talking he was able to answer 
question say his name to feed himself and walk he said 
hours later the man lapsed back into the vegetative state he 
was given a second dose that brought him out of it for about 90 
minutes at that point he was able to do calculations and recall 
aspects of his life 
the man who remains hospitalized has since received different 
longerlasting forms of benzodiazepines a family of drugs that 
includes valium and barbiturates that allowed him to remain lucid 
10 to 12 hours at a time 
kanner said the main problem doctors face now is trying to find 
a combination of drugs the man can take orally rather than 
intravenously that will prevent a relapse into the vegetative state 
the traffic accident put the man into a coma that lasted four 
months kanner said soon after he recovered his condition began 
to deteriorate leaving him in the vegetative state two years after 
the wreck 
the neurologist said that as with most such patients there was 
little known about how to treat the mans condition and little hope 
for recovery before march 12 
i dont know what it is kanner said it was just luck he 
had to have some dental work and it was just luck they administered 
the drugs 
he said the mans case must be viewed as isolated until doctors 
have more time to study why benzodiazepines and particularly 
barbituates have the effect they do

legislation establishing the nations most 
restrictive state abortion law reached gov cecil andrus desk 
tuesday and both camps in the abortion battle pumped up the 
pressure for him to sign or veto the bill 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said in washington that she would urge the groups national 
conference in june to launch a nationwide boycott of all idaho 
products if the antiabortion democrat signs the bill 
were becoming concerned said state commerce director james 
hawkins 
but allen wildmon associate director of the tupelo missbased 
conservative american family association pledged that his members 
would buy more idaho products to counter any boycott 
the governor has until next monday morning to act unless the 
legislature adjourns before then if that happens as is expected 
andrus has 10 days from the time lawmakers leave 
both camps in the abortion battle flooded andrus office with 
telephone calls letters and messages and the governor met with a 
prochoice michigan state legislative candidate to discuss the 
issue 
the candidate republican gwen dempsey said she wanted to make 
andrus aware of the economic risk he would be taking if he signed 
the bill 
theres been a tremendous amount of it people from outside 
the state getting involved andrus said after a 20minute meeting 
with dempsey we in idaho are perfectly capable of making our own 
decisions 
he acknowledged earlier that threats of a boycott of the states 
leading cash crop potatoes could not be ignored but insisted 
they wouldnt affect his decision 
the president of the national abortion rights action league 
joined andrus in questioning the value of the outside interference 
the governor has to make a very important decision that 
affects the life and health of women and im not sure threats like 
that help us help him make his decision said kate michelman 
whose group is campaigning for a veto 
andrus has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape 
incest and to save the life of the woman but hasnt said whether 
hell sign the bill 
the legislation forbids abortion as a form of birth control it 
would ban abortion except in cases involving a threat to the 
womans life or physical health severe fetal deformity incest if 
the victim is under 18 and nonstatutory rape reported within seven 
days 
the bill based on a national right to life committee model 
rejected by other states as too restrictive carries civil 
penalties against doctors performing illegal abortions 
abortion rights advocates maintain the bill is 
unconstitutionally restrictive and have promised an immediate 
legal challenge should it become law that would give antiabortion 
forces the court test they want of the us supreme courts 1973 
roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion

democratic gubernatorial candidate jim mattox on 
tuesday again raised the question of whether his rival ann 
richards has used illegal drugs and said thats one reason shes 
ducking debates before their april 10 runoff 
there is sufficient information to cause me to believe that 
she needs to come forward and discuss these issues in a public 
forum mattox told a news conference 
mattox refused to provide any evidence of his allegations but 
said she doesnt want to answer simple yes or no questions 
about cocaine marijuana and hallucinogens she must answer what 
she used how much for how long and who supplied them 
ms richards 56 had little to say about mattoxs allegation 
during a campaign appearance in mcallen asked by the associated 
press if she wanted to respond to him she replied no 
ms richards has repeatedly refused to give a yesorno answer 
when asked if she ever used illegal drugs a recovering alcoholic 
ms richards has said she hasnt used a moodaltering chemical 
in 10 years and that she never knowingly committed a felony 
this campaign has taken on the predictable form that jim 
mattox campaigns always take ms richards said tuesday 
whatever trash he can throw to try to detract from his poor 
performance he will do that and i expect it to continue until 
election day 
mattox the state attorney general said ms richards is 
refusing to debate him because she doesnt want to face the drug 
issue and questions about her personal finances 
he said she refuses to participate in two televised debates 
proposed for dallas and houston he challenged her to participate 
in those and two more debates before the state capitol press corps 
in austin 
i will appear anytime anywhere mattox told news reporters 
ann richards is off on the run shes hiding 
in mcallen ms richards said she was willing to debate and 
blamed any failure to schedule one so far on her campaign staff 
ms richards said she didnt fear a oneonone format i spend 
most of my time answering his ridiculous questions anyway 
but mattox said his opponent was deliberately dodging events 
other than carefully planned campaign appearances he said such 
tactics would fail against republican nominee clayton williams if 
ms richards wins the democratic nomination 
in another gubernatorial campaign development first lady 
barbara bush in austin to be inducted into the texas womens hall 
of fame said she is proud williams apologized for an offthecuff 
remark he made over the weekend 
at a cattle roundup williams compared the cold wet weather 
delaying the days event to rape saying if its inevitable 
just relax and enjoy it the williams campaign issued a statement 
sunday saying the remark was insensitive and had no place at the 
campfire or in any setting 
mrs bush said williams is quite a person to speak up 
immediately and apologize and say he made a mistake

the sandinista government and 
negotiators for presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro reached 
a preliminary agreement tuesday for a transfer of power on april 25 
the procedural protocol calls demobilization of the 
usbacked contra rebels an essential element for handing over 
the government 
it says the new government will have control of the leftist 
sandinista army and police and that only these institutions should 
have combat weapons 
the document also says the conservative chamorro government will 
respect the rights of thousands of people given confiscated land 
and homes during a decade of revolutionary sandinista rule 
the sandinistas have been handing out thousand of weapons to 
civilians since their feb 25 election defeat and have been urging 
people to defend the conquests of the revolution 
they also have indicated an unwillingness to turn over control 
of the armed forces and police as long as the contras remain an 
armed force 
the protocol says the army and the police will be nonpartisan 
organizations 
the accord was announced late tuesday by the leaders of the 
transition teams defense minister gen humberto ortega of the 
sandinistas and antonio lacayo of mrs chamorros united national 
opposition coalition or uno 
lacayo said the agreement envisions the demobilization of the 
contras by the time mrs chamorro takes office april 25 as called 
for in an agreement reached friday in honduras between uno and the 
rebels 
helicopters of a un observer force meanwhile began flying over 
nicaraguan war zones tuesday in preparation for the contra 
demobilization 
twelve white helicopters emblazoned with the un symbol landed 
at sandinista army installations tuesday morning and two hours 
later took off to the east 
military sources said the aircraft carried members of the 
observer force to eastern jungle zones where they will try to 
contact contra chiefs 
under an agreement reached friday rebels in honduran base camps 
are to disband and return to nicaragua by april 20 rebels in 
nicaragua are to move into security zones under the supervision of 
the un force and cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
the state department on monday said the force should be 
increased from the 200member level agreed to last year by five 
central american presidents that agreement was when its task was 
only to monitor the nicaraguanhonduran border 
the un security council on tuesday approved adding another 800 
troops to the force 
it was not known how many members of the force were in nicaragua 
on tuesday 
fighting has intensified since the signing of the accord friday 
according to the government a contra leader on monday denied the 
reports of combat 
the government proposed that the security zones in which rebels 
are to be moved before they demobilize be small it also said the 
zones should not be in remote regions and that there should not be 
many of them the newspaper barricada said 
it said the assistant defense minister maj gen joaquin cuadra 
lacayo made the suggestions to gen agustin quesada gomez of 
spain chief of the un force 
quesada gomez arrived monday after being called urgently by the 
sandinista government and was expected to travel to honduras to 
show the government proposals to the contras there on wednesday 
rebel commander oscar sovalbarro said the contras are willing to 
move to security zones but only temporarily until the 
demobilization and disarmament process is completed 
international observers and reporters said this week the rebel 
camps in honduras are nearly vacant indicating most of the 
estimated 12000 fighters have infiltrated back into nicaragua 
sovalbarro the contra negotiator in the accord said monday 
that 2000 rebel fighters had returned since friday they joined an 
estimated 4000 who were believed to have returned between 
september and the feb 25 election 
according to barricada the sandinistas proposed that the zones 
have the infrastructure to make them easily accessible for the un 
force and the cardinal 
although the agreement specifies no date for completion of the 
demobilization of forces in nicaragua cuadra insisted it be 
simultaneous with the dismantling in honduras

the us department of energy should have 
known that hydrogen gas building up in nuclear waste storage tanks 
was potentially explosive a former nuclear regulatory commission 
worker said tuesday 
energy department officials said at a meeting with state 
regulators that they became aware only in the past two months of 
the explosion potential at the hanford nuclear reservation 
however they said they were aware as early as 1977 there was 
gas in the huge tanks because the waste level was rising 
in the late 70s and early 80s you first saw a rise and you 
knew nitrous oxide and hydrogen were in there and there was no 
question of flammability said bob cook a former nrc 
representative at hanford and now member of a citizens panel 
looking into the explosive tank issue 
its incredible for me to believe when there is a 22 percent 
hydrogen gas volume in the experiments and that was not considered 
an explosive mixture he said 
energy department officials said they unsuccessfully began 
trying to remove the gas in 1984 
don wodrich a westinghouse hanford co scientist studying the 
tanks said past concerns and action focused only on hydrogen in 
air spaces between the waste level and the roof of the tanks and 
not on hydrogen trapped in air bubbles within the waste itself 
the combination of hydrogen with nitrous oxide and other 
decomposing organics trapped under the hard crust formed at the top 
of the wastes created the new explosion threat he said that was 
discovered only in late february wodrich said 
state regulators said they were satisfied with the steps doe had 
taken to solve the problem so far and agreed that the risk of 
explosion appeared low 
but even a low risk is an unacceptable risk said al conklin 
of the state office of radiation protection 
i dont think people should start running away from hanford 
the problem is not that serious conklin said but i will not 
tell people we dont have a hazard 
the issue became public last friday when hanford manager mike 
lawrence announced that new findings indicated that hydrogen was 
building up inside up to 20 of hanfords 169 storage tanks he said 
there was a low risk of the hydrogen catching fire or exploding

terrorist threats tourists and foreign leaders but their toughest 
current challenge may be allegations of racism aired by their own

the accusations have left the police force racially polarized 
black officers have accused top commanders all white of 
discrimination the police brass has denied the allegations and 
white officers have backed their superiors 
blacks brought their grievances to a house hearing last week 
appearing in such large numbers that a police security detail 
normally would have been assigned to crowd control

moeun mali massaged the bandaged 
stump all thats left of a leg blown off by a mine while she 
walked with friends in the countryside she awaits an ugly 
replacement made of wood leather and steel 
she is 19 and frightened i feel lost now she said 
softlyi dont know about the future 
someone like her has a bleak future in cambodia a western 
aid official said later nobody will marry her and society offers 
little there is still a cultural belief that if you have lost a 
limb you are less than whole you are a secondclass citizen 
moeun mali is one of thousands of cambodians maimed by 
antipersonnel mines which cambodian officials and western aid 
workers say khmer rouge and other guerrillas are sowing in roads 
oxcart trails stream beds and rice fields 
although most of the fighting is along the thai border in the 
northeast they say the mines are being planted throughout the 
country 
in many respects this is a war being fought with land mines 
against civilians and i dont think anybody is keeping records of 
where they are being laid said brett ballard of the american 
friends service committee 
officials of the vietnamsponsored government in phnom penh say 
most of the mines are planted by the khmer rouge whose government 
was ousted by the vietnamese invasion of december 1978 
the khmer rouge and two less powerful guerrilla groups which 
officials say are planting a smaller number of mines are loosely 
allied against the government of prime minister hun sen 
aid workers said half a dozen types of mines are used 
one made by china the guerrillas main arms supplier is a blue 
plastic device that floats just beneath the waters surface and is 
easily detonated 
the mines are light making them ideal for transport from 
guerrilla sanctuaries on the fromtier with thailand and often are 
planted in flooded rice paddies the plastic shards are difficult 
to detect by xray when embedded in a human body 
its a classic khmer rouge terror tactic said ballard who 
runs his organizations aid program in cambodia they dont have 
the peoples hearts and minds so they use the barrel of the gun 
according to cambodian officials the guerrillas objectives are 
to sabotage the economy disrupt community life and convince the 
people the government cannot protect them the guerrillas also 
appear to use mines to ring hideouts and arms caches 
both sides in the civil war sow large numbers of mines in the 
northwestern battle zone and often do not remove the mines when 
they change position 
refugee camps and hospitals on the thai side of the border 
receive a constant stream of victims former soldiers with missing 
limbs beg in the streets of phnom penh 
some say the greatest impact of the mine warfare is 
psychological keeping people on the edge of fear after 20 years of 
war and a reign of terror by the khmer rouge government 
it also seems to have the effect of reminding people of the 
horror experienced under pol pot and in many ways strengthens 
resolve against the khmer rouge ballard said in an interview 
people can see very clearly that the khmer rouge have not 
changed 
at least 1 million people were killed or died of starvation 
while pol pots khmer rouge government was in power from april 1975 
until the vietnamese invaded 
conservative estimates put the number of amputees in cambodia at 
more than 10000 many people are killed outright or die on the way 
to hospitals which can be several days travel from remote 
villages 
twelve provincial centers and one in phnom penh run by the 
government and aided by the american friends service committee 
since 1982 try to cope with the mounting toll 
other foreign agencies are setting up vocational training for 
amputees and otherwise trying to strengthen weak government 
services for the handicapped 
as in vietnam and laos where people still are maimed by mines 
left over from a war that ended 15 years ago aid agencies foresee 
death and injury continuing years after the conflict in cambodia is 
over 
more than 1800 civilians and soldiers have been fitted with 
artificial legs and undergone rehabilitation at the phnom penh 
center artificial arms come from abroad 
the leg made at the center is ugly but is relatively easy to 
make from local resources and requires little maintenance it is 
sturdy designed for farmers working in rice paddies 
one was being made in the workshop for moeun mali who lost her 
right leg in december her father a farmer was killed earlier by 
the khmer rouge 
moeun mali brought her books to the center she hopes to finish 
high school and become a nurse

hear ye hear ye hear ye court is now in 
session equal justice which some call abcs answer to nbcs 
la law begins its regular season run tonight after its 
twohour premiere tuesday 
if tonights episode is any example justice a largecast 
effort set in a bigcity district attorneys office had best plead 
nolo contendere or no contest as they say in lawyerland 
what we have here could be called jurysomething not only 
does it lack bigcity grittiness it also seems written with one 
eye on fox broadcastings youthappeal series and the other eye on 
the first eye 
in the good old days the district attorneys office had a few 
grizzled rumpled barristers here most everyone is young and 
attractive one player james wilder looks like johnny depp in a 
fashionably baggy suit 
true joe morton as the only black on the preppyfilled staff 
also is a fine actor but not even he can overcome a tangled script 
that appears written by parties who learned about criminal law by 
watching tv shows about it 
one of two main cases afoot tonight has morton trying to 
convince residents of a black housing project that they will get 
justice and protection from crime but of course a very 
attractive resident there doubts him 
they clash of course and there is the whiff of potential 
romance of course as he does his best to jail a mugger who 
savagely beat an old woman for her welfare check 
problem is another assistant district attorney needs the 
muggers testimony in a murder case a deal must be struck one 
that would temporarily free the mugger complications and 
frustrations ensue as does an unbelieveable scene in which justice 
is done 
on the lighter side there is the young assistant da wilder 
prosecuting a former porn queen who has defrauded a group of 
dentists at 50000 per defraud in a bogus land deal 
one testifies that she also once was a patient of his she had a 
small overbite but nothing serious he says she did however 
he says express to me her concern about her ability to 
masticate 
ever get the feeling some tv scriptwriters did not major in 
snappy 
amid all this the other young prosecutors bustle about awash 
in satchels court papers oneliners and concern 
a handsome young public defender also briefly checks in causing 
the lovely rookie played by sarah jessica parker to approvingly 
murmur nice 
but she is awfully harried not only is she trying to get time 
to fly home for her fathers 50th birthday she has such a heavy 
caseload she runs from courtroom to courtroom 
when forced to fill in for an injured colleague at a complicated 
grand jury hearing she is so inexperienced she drops her court 
papers before the hearing begins boy thats inexperienced 
but she is spunky in bad scripts spunky always wins 
however it seems a safe bet that the nielsen jury will soon 
declare equal justice guilty of bad show a crime punishable by 
imprisonment at cbs as a replacement for the pat sajak show

peter brazaitis held up what looked like two 
alligator handbags one green and supple the other a tawny brown 
cracked and peeling 
the green bag was indeed alligator the inferior brown bag was 
made from an endangered species of caiman a south american reptile 
whose skin has bony plates that cannot be softened by tanning 
both of these sell for 600 to 800 said brazaitis a 
herpetologist and curator of animals at new york citys central 
park zoo caiman skin breaks so when the public buys an 
endangered skin theyre getting ripped off 
indeed unwary consumers lose twice they pay handsome prices 
for inferior products and their purchases reduce the numbers of an 
endangered species 
trade in socalled exotic leathers made from reptile skins is 
threatening the survival of the worlds 23 species of crocodilians 
19 of which are threatened or endangered crocodilians include 
alligators crocodiles and gavials 
some reptile skins are legal among them are the skins of 
american alligators which make highquality leather and are sold 
for 350 each about 375000 skins were obtained from legal sources 
last year brazaitis said 
but if you look at how many skins are estimated to be in 
trade its 2 million a year he said twothirds of the trade 
is either from an endangered species or an illegal source 
illegal skins which may earn their trappers a mere 5 to 10 
apiece are laundered by mixing them with legal skins before 
they reach tanneries brazaitis said 
trade in illegal skins is not confined to asian bazaars or 
remote tropical outposts top department stores and the exclusive 
boutiques on manhattans east side sell products made of such 
endangered species as the yacare caiman of central and south 
america 
ive just done a circuit of all the major stores surrounding 
the zoo here and ive found products from yacare caiman 
brazaitis said a prestigious name on the door is no guarantee of 
the quality of the reptile skin products inside he said 
as brazaitiss survey suggests trade in illegal skins is 
flourishing it is widespread in the united states despite tight 
safeguards established by the united nations and by congress under 
the us endangered species act 
the us fish and wildlife service estimates 2000 to 3000 
shipments each containing up to several thousand reptile skins 
enter the port of new york each month 
they include skins from boa constrictors nile crocodiles 
african monitor lizards siamese crocodiles anacondas and indian 
rock pythons all shaped into handbags belts shoes and 
briefcases many carry the names of worldfamous designers and 
prestigious retailers 
only experts like brazaitis can tell the legal skins from the 
illegal 
when you get to the department store they dont care said 
brazaitis they dont know nevertheless sales clerks 
confidently assure customers that everything the store sells is 
made from legal skins brazaitis said 
the skins of more than 350 animals confiscated in new york by 
the fish and wildlife service are on display at the central park 
zoo in an exhibit titled the illegal skin trade 
the exhibit includes a us customs declaration form attesting 
to the legality of a wildlife shipment of royal pythons and boa 
constrictors from africa brazaitis chuckled as he pointed it out 
royal pythons come from asia and boa constrictors come from 
south america he said 
most people find reptiles about as welcome as a boa 
constrictors embrace people say what do you want to save 
those things for they eat people brazaitis said 
but their disappearance leads to the loss of tropical 
wilderness a problem receiving increasing attention as americans 
prepare for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of earth day on 
april 22 
crocodilians are predators at the top of the food chain 
brazaitis explained they regulate the population of other species 
an experiment to remove aggressive fearsome nile crocodiles 
from a lake in egypt showed how balances can tip he said the 
fish that people couldnt eat the garbage fish proliferated 
the fish people could eat couldnt compete they declined 
caimans eat snails that carry the parasitic disease 
schistosomiasis deadly to humans with fewer caimans outbreaks of 
the disease could be more common brazaitis suggested 
the concern about trade in reptile skins has echoes of the 
antifur movement but the situations are not the same 
opponents of fur are concerned largely about the welfare of the 
animals that are killed and skinned for their fur trade in fur 
from endangered species has largely been stopped wildlife 
officials say 
trade in reptile skins on the other hand is seriously 
aggravating threats to many of the worlds endangered reptiles 
brazaitis said it is an environmental issue more than an animal 
welfare issue 
brazaitis would like to see it become a consumer issue 
if you elect to buy the caiman product its not going to

for nearly 2000 years pilgrims 
have followed the footsteps of moses up up up the mystic mountain 
of the ten commandments 
as tourists outnumber pilgrims more and more egyptian officials 
have a plan to let climbers bypass many of the 3750 stone steps to 
mount sinais summit laid by centuries of monks 
a cable car they say would make for a quicker and easier trip 
up the mountain which is sacred to jews christians and moslems 
officials of the governments misr sinai tourist co believe 
such an attraction will help increase tourism and provide egypts 
hungry economy with muchneeded dollars opponents object on 
religious spiritual historical and environmental grounds 
this is a holy place it belongs to the world said greek 
orthodox archbishop damianos head of the monastery of st 
catherine which has stood at the mountains base for 1400 years 
abdel azim a bassiouni misr sinais chairman and chief 
advocate of the cable car replied we egyptians are very 
religious its unrealistic to think that technology has no place 
in sacred places we cannot bring it here if it would destroy the 
sanctity or the solitude 
traditionally the 2500foot clim up mount sinai was not meant 
to be comfortable 
early in the christian era as pious men in egypt developed the 
practice that became known as monasticism selfdenial and the 
search for solitude brought the first hermits to caves in sinais 
rocky walls today one hermitmonk still lives in the hills in 
the name of sacrifice 
every day at sunrise and sunset scores of outsiders wind their 
way to a chapel atop mount sinai dedicated to the holy trinity 
misr sinais cable car designed by egyptian and swiss 
engineers would facilitate their trek ascending 1650 feet up 
adjoining mount safsafa 
from the upper terminal tourists would continue to the top of 
mount sinai on foot the twominute ride would cut 45 minutes from 
the usual 2hour climb 
the projects cost of 23 million would be financed by the 
ministry of housing utilities and new communities 
mount safsafa is a few hundred yards from the monastery of st 
catherine across a paved road from the prospective cable cars 
lower terminal is the chapel of the prophet aaron built where 
legend says the restless israelites donated their jewelry to build 
a golden calf 
the old testament stories of moses the burning bush and the 
mountain of the ten commandments have been made the area holy since 
earliest christianity 
in 330 the byzantine empress helena dedicated a chapel to the 
virgin mary in the shelter of the sinai peaks 
two hundred years later emperor justinian ordered a great 
walled fortress built around the site of the burning bush the fort 
remains as the monastery of st catherine a living relic for the 
13 greek orthodox monks who call it home 
it has been protected by crusaders the moslem prophet mohammed 
arab rulers napoleon and in this century the israeli and 
egyptian governments 
priceless collections of icons and manuscripts and a library 
second in religious importance only to the vaticans make st 
catherines a major antiquities treasure 
as traditional keepers of the areas hills chapels caves and 
tombs the monks oppose the cable car they already must deal with 
up to 100 visitors a day 
look at all this beauty said archbishop damianos sitting 
in the stillness of his monastery office the egyptian government 
can make the project because they can force it but we do not 
agree weve never agreed to it 
neither did 10 people asked as they stood with several dozen 
others near the chapel atop mount sinai awaiting the famous 
sunrise 
a michigan student attending american university in cairo who 
did not want his name used said he has experienced the sunrise 
five times but if they build a cable car ill never come 
again 
its important to climb up said dirk glaesmann of west 
germany you feel a part of the mountain if you put up a cable 
car the whole thing would lose its appeal 
an egyptian environmentalist mohammed kassas of cairo 
university feels the cable car would be an eyesore where there now 
is beauty 
if they wanted to pick a worse place to put the cable car 
they couldnt find it kassas said and added 
the area already has lost most of its animal life like the 
sinai leopard its about to lose its plant life the summit 
already gets crowded whats going to happen now 
project engineer ibrahim moharram of ein shams university in 
cairo said the funicular railway with two 15passenger cars would 
pose no danger 
before we designed the cable car we took everything into 
consideration how many people would ride it the environment 
emergency procedures electrical supply he said 
it wont ruin the landscape because it goes up inside a 
natural curve in the rock even the terminals will be small and 
made of rocks to fit into the scenery 
criticism is not new to bassiouni the misr sinai chairman he 
faced opposition in the mid1980s when he built the st catherines 
village hotel on the plain of erraha said to be the campground of 
the israelites while moses was on mount sinai receiving the ten 
commandments from god 
you can propose a road and people will object but in the end 
everybody will use it he said in cairo 245 miles away the 
same will be true here people will thank us

silver was his downfall now its part of his 
salvation 
nelson bunker hunt recently emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings after losing 15 billion with his brother william 
herbert hunt speculating in the silver futures market 
now bunker has put his collection of ancient coins on the 
sothebys auction block what is said to be the greatest such 
collection owned by one person ever to be sold 
sothebys also is selling herberts collection of ancient 
bronzes and byzantine coins and together the hunt treasures are 
expected to fetch more than 20 million 
bunker flew to new york from his home in dallas one recent day 
to talk about silver tetradrachms and decadrachms the money and 
preserved wonders of long ago civilizations 
his eyes scan a table at sothebys where ancient coins in 
sparkling silver and shattering gold silently stare at modern 
times some are as small as a thumbnail and weigh but a few grams 
others have the diameter of a silver dollar and would add a 
welcomed weight to any pocket one is as large as an angry fist 
they are so beautifully defined they could have emerged from 
the engravers chisel only moments earlier some bear the artisans 
name all when held seem to tremble with the mysteries of time 
a silver decadrachm of agrigentum shows a twowheeled chariot 
with four horses driven by the sun god helios an eagle soars above 
carrying a snake below a crab scampers between pounding hooves 
the reverse design shows two eagles with a dead hare lying on rocks 
the coin was struck circa 411 bc it is only the seventh 
specimen of its type weighs almost 2 ounces and measures about 1 
inches in diameter it was made to celebrate exainetus a citizen 
of agrigentum who had won in the olympic games 
another much smaller coin is the extremely rare ides of march 
denarius of brutus struck to mark the assassination of julius 
caesar in 44 bc the obverse the side of a coin bearing the main 
design shows the bare head of brutus the reverse shows a pileus 
a brimless hat worn in ancient rome between two daggers 
hunts collection of almost 3000 coins in silver gold and 
bronze not only attests to the magnificent artistry of ancient 
engravers but also documents 1000 years of history from the 
archaic period in greece to the fall of the roman empire in 476 ad 
it took the 64yearold hunt about six years to amass his 
collection he sought coins from around the world largely in 
switzerland and kept them in a delaware bank vault 
parting for the fallen texas tycoon is indeed sweet sorrow 
i hate to have to sell them but thats what life is 
sometimes you buy and sometimes you sell he said 
its like friends you hope to make new friends as time goes 
on and you hope you wont lose all your old friends ill miss 
them and its been a great pleasure collecting them and owning 
them but ill just have to go and do the best i can i dont know 
if ill ever be an art collector again but i enjoy going to 
museums 
hunt also is selling 15 greek vases ranging in style from the 
geometrical designs of the early archaic period about the 7th 
century bc to the more fluid style of the classical age the 
drawings chronicle the vicissitudes of everyday life the departure 
of herakles a mortal hero for olympus hypnos sleep and 
thanatos death carrying the body of sarpedon athletes putting 
on armor a concert 
his brothers collection of ancient bronzes covers the entire 
span of classical art from the italian bronze age 8th century 
bc through the roman art of the 3rd century ad his collection 
of byzantine coins is said to be the largest privately held 
the sons of flamboyant oil baron hl hunt a gambler who turned 
a 5000 inheritance into one of the biggest family fortunes in 
america were pushed into bankruptcy by lawsuits and internal 
revenue service claims in 1989 that bunker owed 73042 million for 
back taxes and interest and that herbert owed 31731 million 
including other creditors bunkers debts topped 15 billion and 
herberts almost 12 billion 
in september 1988 the brothers filed for protection from their 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code after a 
peruvian mining company won a 196 million judgment against them 
for their attempt according to a federal jury in new york to 
corner the silver market in 1979 and 1980 the brothers denied any 
wrongdoing 
i had silver but i didnt corner any market because the 
market obviously was a very big market bunker hunt said but 
people do accuse you of things sometimes quite unjustly 
i had a lot of silver and a big position in silver and 
ultimately the market as you know became nonliquid where you 
couldnt sell and you couldnt buy and thats what really 
destroyed in my opinion the value of silver 
the brothers ultimately lost 15 billion after amassing 59 
million ounces of silver then estimated at onethird the world 
supply falling real estate prices and the collapse of the oil 
market worsened matters 
the sothebys auction is part of the liquidation plan other 
assets that were sold off or that will be sold include australian 
ranch and farm land an 81290acre ranch in southeastern oklahoma 
a 9012acre ranch that straddles the tennesseemississippi state 
line thoroughbred race horses at one time he owned 700 large 
pieces of land in alaska california and arizona and a bowling 
alley 
but the coin collection is his biggest loss bunker said 
its something i enjoyed very much and im told by some of 
the experts that its probably the finest collection in the 
world he said that was my intention to build up the finest 
collection that a person could get 
but he sighed all good things come to an end sometimes 
and i know these new buyers will enjoy them 
bunker who recently lost holdings in penrod drilling co to 
various banks plans to go back to work im going to work at 
some things i know such as the oil business and gas business and 
explorations 
meanwhile the hunt collections of ancient wealth will travel 
the globe to attract buyers stopping in los angeles chicago 
london frankfurt munich monte carlo zurich geneva hong kong 
singapore tokyo and osaka 
initial sales will take place at sothebys in new york in june 
a second in december bunkers islamic coin collection will be sold 
by sothebys in london in march 1991 and the final sale of 
herberts byzantine coins will be held in new york in june 1991

along the grassy streets of pearl 
lagoon on the edge of its lonely dock in hammocks swaying in the 
shade people are waiting for the revolution a ferry boat as 
elusive as a campaign promise 
it sailed into the lagoon on the sunday after nicaraguas 
election spent an hour or so then sailed away 
a few people rode on the ferry many just heard of it but 
everyone seems to have an opinion about it 
some people think it is progress said irma de sosa a 
schoolteacher who has become an authority on the subject by virtue 
of being one of those who rode 
some feel like the government is just fooling the people that 
the boat wont come back she said spreading her hands and 
smiling 
well just have to wait and see 
the sandinista government far away in managua had long 
promised pearl lagoon a ferry for the 30mile run to bluefields 
port the link to the rest of the world for nicaraguas thinly 
populated atlantic coast 
that single visit by the revolution a 150passenger vessel is 
the only evidence residents have seen 
in many ways the ferry symbolizes the regions long fight for 
autonomy for some control of its own fate 
places like this town of 1900 are the essence of the atlantic 
coast an englishspeaking area so isolated from the rest of 
nicaragua that it seems like another country 
not a shot was fired here when the sandinistas overthrew the 
late president anastasio somoza in 1979 and the atlantic coast was 
largely untouched more than a decade later there still is no road 
between it and the spanishspeaking pacific side of nicaragua 
it was not the first time revolution passed the region by 
when the rest of central america was fighting for independence 
from spain the coast was a british protectorate with miskito 
indian royalty british buccaneers raided the spanish fleet with 
ships built in pearl lagoon 
the atlantic coast region is home to onetenth of nicaraguas 
33 million people a rich mixture of creoles latinos and sumo 
rama garifona and miskito indians it includes half the national 
territory of about 50000 square miles 
pearl lagoon has a couple of toyota trucks but the green 
streets look more like the fairways of a golf course it doesnt 
receive television from managua 200 miles to the west 
as with most hamlets dotting the coves inlets and rivers water 
is pearl lagoons only link to the world 
a regular ferry a boat of its own would mean a measure of 
independence and an end to the balmy isolation that envelops the 
lagoon like a daydream 
the atlantic coast is the poorest region of one of the 
hemispheres poorest nations but pearl lagoon is a fortune in the 
raw 
it rests on the banks of one of the richest breeding grounds of 
the succulent white shrimp on the edge of rich lobster beds it is 
the kind of place that feeds the dreams of entrepreneurs 
a businessman remembered simply as the chinaman the lagoons 
last success story dried and exported shrimp the sandinistas 
confiscated his shrimp plant fishing boats and rice mill and 
drove the chinaman into exile 
the boats went to bluefields said leslie hunsack a 
60yearold fisherman it did us no good here in pearl lagoon 
after the sandinistas nationalized the fishing industry pearl 
lagoon was left with a single customer that set its own price the 
government 
fishermen say months sometimes pass between the visits by boats 
from outside to pick up the catch we have our nets out and we 
catch this fish and we cant do anything with it said linton 
fox a community leader 
at least two young fishermen have died trying to make an extra 
dollar a pound on their lobster they were shot by government 
agents while on smuggling runs to the colombian island of san 
andreas 110 miles southeast of pearl lagoon 
we have always felt like a colony inside a country said 
labor leader alvin guthrie a creole from the coast elected to the 
new national assembly under the sandinistas it was like having 
spanish viceroys around 
in the northern atlantic coast region the managua governments 
attempts to enforce its policies provoked a bloody uprising of 
miskito indians 
finally the sandinistas admitted they had made mistakes and 
passed a regional autonomy law that at least in theory was the 
most sweeping in latin america 
autonomy remains a promise however not a reality 
members of the first autonomous councils one for the north 
coast and one for the south where pearl lagoon and bluefields are 
located were chosen in the feb 25 general elections 
still to be negotiated is the relationship between the regional 
and central governments at heart a question of control over gold 
lumber and fishing resources 
we dont know much about autonomy said fox a member of the 
regional assembly but wed have the rights to our property our 
lumber our fish our shrimps would go to build up our little town 
not to build up managua or bluefields 
the sandinistas failed to overcome the suspicions and 
hostilities of the coast with the autonomy project like the rest 
of nicaragua the coast voted against them in the february election 
sandinista leaders predict autonomy would die under the 
government of president violeta barrios de chamorro which takes 
office april 25 
her conservative alliances platform does not mention autonomy 
and sandinista leaders say its goal of privatization is 
incompatible with local control of the regions riches 
the backbone for autonomy is the natural resources what is in 
the sea and what is in the forest said johnny hodgson a 
sandinista leader in bluefields 
british and american companies that exploited the coast the 
somoza dictatorship the sandinistas none brought prosperity or 
gave the coast a real say in its affairs 
hunsack the fisherman picked up his saw and prepared to cut 
another board 
he is tired of waiting for the revolution and is building his 
own boat 
this autonomy the sandinistas had they were using people as a 
tool hunsack said we expect better we couldnt get worse

in the quiet of the morning when the sun 
peeks over the rolling farm fields the trek to the golden dome 
begins one by one businessmen arrive ready to start their day 
by sitting in silence 
there are oil brokers and engineers a toymaker too all are 
successful entrepreneurs and all are meditators 
thousands of souls have flocked to this meditation mecca home 
of maharishi international university to study share a lifestyle 
and build their own businesses a trend that has spawned 
prosperity and growth in an isolated patch of americas heartland 
it is a remarkable community says daniel dittemore head of 
the iowa product development corporation a statesponsored seed 
capital investment program they have an uncommon appetite and 
knack for entrepreneurship 
in the last several years scores of transcendental meditators 
have moved their companies to fairfield or begun new ones here 
theres an ice cream maker who markets to stores in new york 
chicago and other cities a chimney sweep supplier with thousands 
of customers a studio that photographs many of the countrys top 
marathons and a toymaker who produces the zube tube a hotselling 
cylinder touted as the ultimate cosmic sound machine 
others are engineers attorneys insurance agents or computer 
experts by one estimate there are about 20 computer companies 
thus the nickname silicorn valley 
theres a remarkable population of technologically oriented 
companies out of all proportion of what youd expect to find in a 
community that size said dittemore 
iowa gov terry branstad has dubbed fairfield a town of 11000 
one of the states economic superstars 
the local business chamber doesnt track the number of companies 
run or owned by meditators but some in the community claim such 
firms employ about 1000 people and more than 50 do business 
nationally or overseas 
weve put a lot of energy into this town a lot of money a 
lot of talent and a lot of job opportunities said john narducci 
president of chappell studiomarathon foto which photographs 
marathons and nearly a quartermillion graduates annually 
any small town in the midwest would like to have 2500 
people said jerry leahy a meditator who is board chairman of 
overland outfitters a familyowned outerwear firm with 11 stores 
nationwide it just isnt often you have them come in and bring 
their own jobs and bring their own payroll 
though meditators contribute to fairfields success theyre not 
the prime movers said mike brouwer executive vice president of 
the chamber of commerce which has about 400 members 
im not willing to slight 22 major manufacturers in this 
community some have been here over 100 years he said 
but he credits the meditators with creating innovative ways to 
support themselves 
some come because of the university others because the 
benefits seem to grow when youre meditating with other people 
said patty schneider public affairs chief at the college founded 
by the maharishi mahesh yogi the indian guru who once dazzled the 
beatles and other celebrities 
transcendental meditators believe if they gather in large 
numbers they create the maharishi effect a positive 
influence on events ranging from global conflicts to the rate of 
traffic deaths more than 7000 meditators gathered here in 1983 
for the taste of utopia 
each morning and afternoon meditators practice their technique 
in the golden domes of pure knowledge one for ladies one for 
gents to avoid distractions 
estimates of meditators range from 2000 to 3000 many attend 
or work at the university which moved from california in 1974 into 
the campus of defunct parsons college and has a fulltime 
enrollment of 799 meditators also run their own school for 
elementary and high school students 
male miu students often wear ties and jackets and jeans are 
discouraged 
the straitlaced appearance fits in well with midamerica and 
meditators work sidebyside with nonmeditators in businesses and 
the city council 
but theres still the dividing line between those people and 
some people in the community said royse huff president of the 
fairfield economic development association 
some things remain destined to stay separate such as the yogic 
flying competitions which prompted one enterprising company years 
ago to sell cushions to soften levitation landings 
yogic flying according to vedic tradition has three stages 
hopping usually crosslegged on a padded course hovering and 
flying we have been in the first stage quite a number of 
years mrs schneider says 
such happenings trigger jokes and the nickname the flying 
university 
brouwer doesnt mind i have such a thick skin over it over 
the years that it doesnt bother me because there are so many good 
things that come out of the relationship between miu and 
fairfield he said 
mayor bob rasmussen sees envy behind the tongueincheek teasing 
we dont have a lot of empty buildings valuation of houses 
has increased substantially he said they can make all the fun 
they want were doing just fine and thank you 
the town he added is not about to lose its identity im a 
strong believer we have enough of a solid base its not going 
to be a matter of them taking over the city he said 
but the mayor also noted attitudes have changed since the early 
days when some townsfolk wondered if the meditators were a cult or 
a religion 
theres certainly a stronger acceptance and less 
divisiveness he said theyve integrated much better we 
respect each other and get along 
iowans have a work ethic and a sense of clean living that we 
fit very well with as a group said rob glazier a meditator 
whose engineering firm has grown from four employees to 75 in three 
years 
some say acceptance just took time 
people in a town like this have been here three or four 
generations said bob daniels a meditator with a chimney sweep 
supply company they may want to take 10 years checking you out 
thats not bad 
glazier said oldline business leaders also realize were a 
larger economic force attracting outside capital 
indeed huff praises the meditators for demonstrating how 
business can be done internationally others say theyve added a 
cosmopolitan flavor to fairfield 
but problems remain while meditators are terrific promoters 
brouwer said theres a credibility gap they traditionally say 
things before they do things he said and market before the 
fact huff also said there has been a tremendous turnover of 
meditator businesses 
there have been legal troubles too the state sued a 
selfproclaimed millionaire maker after he failed to make 
refunds to 10000 consumers who bought his nodownpayment real 
estate courses advertised on tv a 35 million judgment was 
entered against him but he has filed for bankruptcy 
the meditators remain committed to their goal of creating heaven 
on earth 
were not quite as utopian the mayor responds when they 
say this is heaven i like fairfield but i like naples fla 
too

congressional watchdogs continue to nip at the 
agriculture department in hopes the creaky old agency will 
modernize itself before the 20th century ends 
but the structure and inertia of usda are formidable attempts 
have been made for 45 years largely unsuccessful to streamline 
departmental field structure and management 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress has been studying usda organization and departmental 
inhibitions for at least two years a preliminary report was issued 
in december 
formal responses to gaos analysis will be sought from 
departmental agencies and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
when the final report is ready later in the year 
meanwhile the gao has followed up its initial review with a 
supplemental report to yeutter about the need for improved 
workforce planning in his department such planning should be 
mandatory the gao said 
at its simplest workforce planning means getting the right 
people in the right jobs now and over the long haul the object is 
to deliver government services to the public efficiently and 
economically 
the problems involve 36 agencies that carry out the departments 
policies and programs in 1988 the gao said those functions cost 
taxpayers more than 44 billion and required the services of 
110000 fulltime employees in more than 15000 places around the 
world 
usda agencies are experiencing problems recruiting highly 
skilled workers providing adequate training to employees 
developing effective managers and managing a culturally diverse 
workforce the latest report said these problems are 
longstanding pervasive and will likely continue given present 
trends in usda and in the federal government 
the growing importance of food safety water quality and 
biotechnology requires more scientists in usdas workforce yet a 
shortage of scientists generally as well as competition from the 
private sector put usda at a disadvantage 
moreover the report said agencies within usda sometimes find 
themselves competing against each other for people from the same 
job occupations a condition which is counterproductive from a 
departmental standpoint 
another inhibitor has been the lack of a departmental recruiting 
program each usda agency goes its own way and generally does not 
refer unneeded applicants to other agencies 
however the report noted that the departments office of 
personnel has recently contracted to develop a videotape for 
recruiting new employees 
as the agricultural economy becomes more consumerdriven than 
productionoriented usda needs employees with backgrounds in 
marketing management to supplement the skills of their other 
employees trained in the agricultural sciences the report said 
when the gao looked at employee training there were many 
indications of poorly or inadequately trained staff in a number 
of areas also the report cited continuing problems in achieving 
and maintaining an ethnically diverse workforce of women and 
minorities 
a major gao complaint is that department agencies generally 
address only a single years needs to patch up a problem when 
longrange remedies are in order this has been apparent in the 
farmers home administration and the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service for example 
but the report said some usda agencies are laying the 
groundwork for effective workforce planning 
for example the forest service uses a strategic human 
resource guide to forecast skillmix changes and attrition 
through 1995 the forecasts are used in preparing annual job 
recruitment recommendations and for measuring progress toward 
employment goals 
another is the animal and plant health inspection service which 
is reorganizing its personnel function to include workforce 
planning 
although these tentative steps toward workforce planning are 
encouraging without central direction and support the initiatives 
may be stifled and those agencies without workforce planning may 
never develop it the report said 
gao said department personnel leaders recognize the importance 
of workforce planning but have not taken a leadership role in 
developing guidance for agencies to follow nor have they 
instituted a mechanism for tracking and monitoring individual 
agency tracking systems 
the report acknowledged that department personnel officials 
recently organized a task force to improve usdas image as an 
employer and thereby enhancing its ability to recruit and retain 
quality employees 
but the gao also noted that the departments personnel office 
lacked the funds and people to operate the task force on its own 
so individual agencies were asked to chip in 
however there still exists no departmental policy on 
workforce planning the report said 
consistent workforceplanning standards and guidance are 
needed to encourage all agencies to initiate workforce planning and 
to reinforce agencies efforts already undertaken the report 
said

bob thorlakson looked back at 22 years in the 
army and ahead to the shrinking military of the postcold war 90s 
and made a decision 
i got out i decided not to wait around for the cuts to hit 
he says 
thorlakson and untold numbers of other men and women in the 
american armed forces are trying to make their peace with peace 
some are leaving many more are considering it most apparently 
are hoping to hold on unsure theyll avoid the ax but unwilling 
just now to give up the uniform and make the leap back to civilian 
life 
you read so much about the cutbacks that are coming down the 
road says lt col bill daniels who plans to retire this year 
after he completes his 20th year in the air force 
these private struggles are being played out across the nation 
and at us bases abroad as the bush administration and congress 
scale down defenses in light of a suddenly receding soviet military 
threat big force reductions are coming some estimate 300000 
people over four years although the crunch is not likely to hit 
many military families until next year 
thorlakson 45 didnt know when he retired last december if he 
would have been forced out by the cutbacks he held the rank of 
lieutenant colonel and was nearly eligible for promotion but the 
armys future and thus his own looked so murky he took his 
chances on a civilian job 
like many others who had never held a job outside the military 
thorlakson stumbled at first he took a job selling family 
financial services but soon found it didnt suit him he quit now 
he is looking for work in personnel management 
thorlakson of suburban washington is confident hell find a 
good job but for many others facing similar decisions the 
prospect of change can be intimidating even though its too early 
to know how many onetime soldiers will be competing for civilian 
jobs 
they are apprehensive they dont know whats going on says 
jack merritt a retired army general who keeps in close contact 
with servicemen he is executive vice president of the association 
of the united states army a champion of army causes 
the fear is felt even among those just entering the service 
merritt spoke recently to rotc cadets at norwich university a 
military school in northfield vt 
that was foremost on their minds is there a future for me 
now 
my answer is of course theres a future but it will be a 
future for fewer people he says 
pentagon planners are worried too theyve never had to shrink 
an allvolunteer force which now has 21 million activeduty 
personnel many careers will be slowed many ended and some will 
be changed even before they begin a recent pentagon report to 
congress said many rotc students some of whom signed up as long as 
five years ago will not be allowed to enter active duty theyll 
have to serve their required time in the reserves 
soon probably starting next year the pink slip will start 
coming the pentagon is concerned that this might hurt morale and 
discourage americas youth from taking a chance on the military in 
the future 
in force reductions following world war ii and the korean and 
vietnam wars thousands of draftees were itching to turn in their 
weapons and get back into civvies 
thats not true today christopher jehn the assistant 
defense secretary for force management and personnel said in an 
interview everybody in the military wants to be there including 
many who believe they made a career commitment to the military 
theyve all got contracts with us defense secretary dick 
cheney said recently and so how we treat them is going to have a 
big impact on our continued ability to recruit and retain 
firstclass people to serve in the military 
the problem is most acute in the army which plans to cut about 
135000 from its total force of 770000 by 1994 and congress could 
order more 
most army cuts will hit the enlisted ranks but officers also 
will be dropped the pentagon recently asked congress for greater 
authority to fire officers in grades below lieutenant colonel it 
said this would be done only as a last resort but added the 
armys situation is severe enough to warrant such action even if 
more is done to encourage officers and others to quit voluntarily 
brig gen timothy stroup the armys top personnel manager 
says one of his main goals is to prevent exsoldiers from feeling 
they were unfairly forced to leave 
they go back to the hometowns of america to be the fathers 
and mothers of the next generation of young men and women that join 
the military stroup said its important that we have 
satisfied alumni 
adds sen john warner rva the ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee memories are long if we botch 
the job now in scaling back military spending can we depend on an 
allvolunteer force to come to our rescue in the future 
many in congress are calling for deeper and swifter reductions 
than the administration has proposed they know that the quickest 
path to a peace dividend is to save on troop costs even though 
the defense department cautions against a politically inspired rush 
to retrench the pentagon spends nearly half its 300 
billionayear budget on manpower 
the pentagon says it can reach its goal of shrinking the armed 
forces by 50000 people this year with few if any firings fewer 
recruits will be hired to fill the usual number of vacancies left 
by retirements resignations deaths and discharges 
attrition alone wont do the trick in 1991 though or for the 
next several years 
because the services have not yet resorted to dismissals the 
fear of firing is only beginning to set in 
when you see those cuts then youll see a different attitude 
among the young kids with 10 or 12 years of service where am i 
going theyll wonder says col fred allega a marine pilot who 
is retiring but not because of the coming squeeze 
people are feeling more secure than they should says navy

stanley d hyman president of identify research institute 
which advises military people on making the transition to civilian 
life says most soldiers are at least vaguely aware of the painful 
adjustments they face but are trying to ignore them 
its like theyre thinking i know im going to the dentist 
to have all my teeth pulled but its next year im all right now 
when its going to be tomorrow i worry 
hyman hears from soldiers around the country one recent day 
while talking with a visitor at his home in mclean va hyman got 
a call from a sailor who said he was thinking of quitting because 
his base at norfolk va would be cutting back 
this guy is scared hyman said after hanging up 
signs of increased anxiety among military people are just 
beginning to appear says hyman who has been advising service 
families for more than 20 years he predicts the force reductions 
will take a heavy emotional toll in the next several years 
were going to see more suicides more family breakups he 
says 
jehn the pentagon personnel chief says he needs congress help 
to make the force reductions as quickly as required yet as painless 
for people as possible 
the defense department is asking for authority to provide 
severance pay to enlisted people who get the ax something never 
done before under current law officers cut after five to 20 years 
of service are given one months base pay for each year of service 
up to 30000 jehn said enlisted people should get equal treatment 
stroup the army personnel chief said the department also needs 
more latitude to cut officers 
we dont want to do that but we have to reduce the force and 
you want to keep your force balanced so you dont have too many 
senior officers and no junior officers he said 
jehn said the department also is developing an experimental 
program in cooperation with the labor department to help 
servicemen with 10 to 14 years of experience to adjust to the 
civilian job market they will be advised on ways of searching for 
a job conducting themselves in job interviews and writing resumes 
those kinds of things most of these people arent going to 
know he said

the lutherans want philip morris to get out of 
the tobacco business 
minnesotas state employees want texaco to pledge not to 
discriminate against roman catholics in northern ireland animal 
rights groups want better living conditions for the chickens 
purchased by kentucky fried chicken 
these and scores of other organizations are using investments in 
us corporations to pressure their companies to adopt their 
positions on political and social issues 
this year the hot issue is the environment with the 
shareholders of more than 30 companies proposing that they be 
allowed to vote on issues ranging from putting environmentalists on 
corporate boards to redesigning exxons tanker fleet 
when exxon holds its annual meeting april 25 and when exxon 
shareholders get proxy ballots in the mail no fewer than eight 
environmental proposals will be raised by stockholders 
but environmental issues are by no means the only ones being 
raised from within corporate america 
the conservative caucus for example wants chevron to refuse to 
deal with governments that vote more than 80 percent of the time 
against the us position at the united nations 
the united methodist church and other denominations working 
through the interfaith center on corporate responsibility want 
bristolmyers squibb to stop advertising infant formula on 
television 
the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals wants 
pepsico to investigate living conditions of the chickens it buys 
for its subsidiary kentucky fried chicken 
what these stockholder activists are practicing is called 
corporate democracy 
in fact some of these investors own stocks for the sole purpose 
of influencing a companys course theye out to make a point not 
a profit 
corporate democracy got its start in 1932 when lewis gilbert 
then a young newspaperman was gaveled to silence when he tried to 
ask some questions at the annual meeting of consolidated gas co 
in which he owned 10 shares 
gilbert stormed out quit his job and has devoted his life to 
fighting this silent dictatorship over other peoples money 
ever since he and his brother john have attended as many as 100 
annual meetings a year to demand that management heed stockholders 
most corporations hold their annual meetings in the spring so 
many a chief executive officer is preparing for a day of frayed 
nerves 
not that the stockholder proponents will win they hardly ever 
do last year about 500 stockholder proposals were advanced 170 
of them reached a vote but only five got a majority 
in any case the proposals are only advisory they dont compel 
management to do anything although management often gets the 
message and often negotiates to meet the stockholders demands 
even before the issue reaches a vote 
it used to be commonplace for stockholder proposals to get under 
3 percent of the vote or less 
but these days we often get 10 to 25 percent and it sends a 
strong message when management knows that such a critical mass of 
their shareholders want them to leave south africa or improve their 
environmental records says timothy smith who runs the 
interfaith center on corporate responsibility 
smiths group coordinates the investments of 240 roman catholic 
and protestant church groups with assets of 25 billion this 
spring the churches are bringing proposals before the stockholders 
of more than 150 companies 
asked why corporations negotiate when theyre sure of beating 
down stockholder proposals smith said one chief executive 
officer told us it is not in the best interests of our company to 
be seen doing battle with the christian church on an important 
ethcial issue 
so proponents claim some impressive victories even though they 
technically lost 
a number of us companies have cut ties with south africa 
stockholder activists say they are due some of the credit for 
cracks in the walls of apartheid 
keeping the pressure on institutions with assets of over 250 
billion have filed proposals this year that call on additional 
companies to sever south african ties 
in the 1970s and 1980s more than 100 planned nuclear plants 
were canceled in part from pressure by antinuclear stockholder 
groups 
keeping track of corporate democracy whos proposing what to 
whom is the business of the investor responsibility research 
center a nonprofit washington outfit that owes its existence to a 
black student protest at harvard university in 1972 
the students had taken over a campus building to demand that the 
university sell its gulf oil stock on the grounds that gulf was 
supporting angolas status as the black colony of a white nation 
portugal 
harvard president derek bok had difficulty finding the facts of 
the case the university said that if it simply sold its gulf stock 
it would forfeit any power it has to influence gulfs policies 
that episode led to the decision by some of the biggest names in 
philanthrophy the ford rockefeller and carnegie foundations all 
with heavy portfolios to create irrc they gave it the mission of 
assembling impartial information about corporate behavior and 
stockholder proposals 
i think corporations behave somewhat differently knowing that 
more and more and bigger and bigger shareholders are looking over 
their shoulders says executive director margaret carroll who 
has been with the center from the start 
part of irrcs mission is informing institutional investors of 
the proposals raised by activists 
pension funds banks insurance companies mutual funds college 
endowment funds foundations and other vast pools of money account 
for 75 percent of the trading at the new york stock exchange they 
have a fiduciary responsibility to know what they are voting on 
about 350 institutions from the bank of america to the 
archdiocese of new york pay irrc from 800 to 22000 a year to 
keep track of 1500 corporations 
the center gathers data from the corporations themselves the 
securities and exchange commission newspaper clippings and the 
fine print on the ballots known as proxy statements that companies 
mail shareholders these tell what the proponents want to do and 
why the board of directors doesnt want to do it 
we find the materials they produce quite useful says jim 
heidelberg assistant to the executive director of the minnesota 
state board of investment which invests 126 billion in pension 
funds of minnesota state employees and retirees 
adds the interfaith centers timothy smith their research is 
exceptionally important it is used around the country by 
shareholders who attempt to act as socially responsible investors 
the minnesota legislature has passed laws prohibiting the 
investment of retirement funds in certain ways so in its role as 
an investor minnesota is asking fellow stockholders of such 
companies as texaco security pacific and sonoco to vote to request 
a report on corporate attempts to combat anticatholic bias in 
their facilities in northern ireland other states do the same 
under sec regulations corporations may deny a place on the 
proxy ballot for proposals that deal with ordinary business 
operations on those grounds tobacco companies were able to beat 
back proposals dealing with tobacco sales 
but this year the sec staff reversed itself and allowed a 
tobacco question to go before stockholders so shareholders of 
philip morris and two other tobacco companies will vote on whether 
their companies should get out of the tobacco business by dec 31

q how many times can the cinderella story be told a as often 
as hamlet can be staged as long as its done with talent and 
imagination 
happily that has been accomplished with pretty woman in 
which cinderella turns out to be a novice hooker and prince 
charming is a ruthless corporate raider during their oneweek 
romance they reform each other and achieve a happy if illogical 
ending 
what makes pretty woman so palatable is a starmaking 
performance by julia roberts whose glowing smile will grace many a 
future film already impressive as a dramatic actress in steel 
magnolias and the only member of the stellar cast to win an 
academy nomination she is stunning in comedy 
the film also benefits from an airtight script by jf lawton 
an expert in oneliners and sight gags and from the surehanded 
direction by garry marshall a veteran of the sitcom wars marshall 
knows how to milk laughs out of any situation he can polish a 
throwaway gem such as a convertible gliding down rodeo drive with 
the driver on a telephone and a youngster talking on his own phone 
credulity is strained at the beginning when julia roberts is 
seen in the snakepit milieu of hollywood boulevard wearing a 
dutchboy wig and a comeon look richard gere comes along seeking 
directions and needing someone to drive a stickshift car borrowed 
from his lawyer roberts and gere drive to the regent beverly 
wilshire hotel and use his penthouse suite in pursuit of her 
profession 
the multimillionaire is amused by the ingenuous hooker and 
engages her as his companion during a week of maneuvers for a 
takeover of a shipbuilding corporation owned by ralph bellamy the 
arrangement puts roberts in hilarious situations some baldly 
lifted from my fair lady instead of ascot racetrack roberts 
mixes with the swells at a polo match 
pretty woman has its flaws the saccharine ending is a 
letdown and the villainy by geres lawyer jason alexander 
becomes overwrought but during most of its length the film 
fascinates largely because of the incandescent roberts her tussle 
with escargot in a posh restaurant is a screamer 
gere is in splendid form as well underplaying his role as the 
financial shark whose life is changed by the hollywood hustler 
hector elizondo is marvelous as the hotel manager who befriends his 
unwanted guest and laura san giacomo again impresses as roberts 
roommate

blue sky mining cbs midnight oil 
 
blue sky mining represents an important moment in the career 
of midnight oil the record is a chance for the australian band to 
consolidate gains made with its last release the us breakthrough 
diesel and dust in 1987 
so what does midnight oil decide to sing about the environment 
malaise world unity obvious choices at a time when socially 
conscious rock is a fad 
except that midnight oil has addressed such subjects for years 
the band has always been more interested in making a point than 
making a buck the point on blue sky mining is that the worlds 
a mess if anyone cares 
often that message is eloquently stated by lead singersocial 
activist peter garrett two of the best cuts river runs red 
and blue sky mine lament that man takes from the land but 
rarely puts anything back nothings as precious as a hole in the 
ground garrett brays sarcastically in the latter 
forgotten years a variation on billy joels we didnt 
start the fire assesses the current generations place in 
history and concludes that its time to give a damn the 
desperate and divided years these should not be forgotten years 
garrett sings 
the final tracks one country and the wryly titled 
antarctica punctuate the record with two exclamation marks 
the former is a plea for global harmony the latter a plea for a 
place not yet fouled by mankind 
musically the group is more restrained than in the past for 
garrett the approach makes his words more evocative than ever but 
the muted sound which includes strings on much of side 2 robs the 
rest of the band of some of its wallop 
while ace guitarists jim moginie and martin rotsey are 
occasionally set loose the introduction to river runs red is 
glorious such instrumental peaks are frustratingly few its 
ironic that on an album so concerned about natural resources 
midnight oil wastes some of its own

tafelmusik by georg philipp telemann archiv musica antiqua 
koln directed by reinhard goebel 
 
if its been said that vivaldi wrote the same concerto hundreds 
of times the saying also goes that telemann wrote hundreds of 
concertos once or maybe its the other way around 
anyway this amazingly prolific contemporary of bach and handel 
composed more than 3000 pieces a bounty for the telemann fan and 
a distinctly uninteresting fact for those who prefer mozart 
beethoven or brahms 
as the fine liner notes in this typically handsome archiv 
package point out tafelmusik or banquet music was not strictly 
intended as background for meals though the modern cdowner with a 
neutral attitude to telemann may indeed put it to that use 
telemann wrote these pieces for sale to subscribers as a complete 
set 
scored for small groups of strings with variously flutes 
recorder oboes or trumpets the works are divided into three 
parts each part is subdivided into five multimovement sections 
suite quartet concert trio and solo followed by a conclusion 
tafelmusik is sort of like telemanns ring cycle 
the sections are often performed or recorded separately archiv 
does a good service by issuing them complete in four discs 
totaling more than four hours the casual listener has the benefit 
of an excellent sample of telemanns work and the connoisseur has 
a complete version of one of telemanns finest compositions 
the performance is impeccable in fact too impeccable the 
musicians playing period instruments are overly polite in their 
interpretation the flutes albeit not modern instruments have a 
timid almost boring sound some quite expressive playing though 
comes from the violins the harpsichord continuo often overbalances 
the other instruments

for a little over a year in 
188889 vincent van gogh painted with a passionate frenzy 
producing about 200 oils and 100 drawings 
from this creative compulsion emerged some of the most popular 
works of art ever van goghs vibrantly colored sunflowers fishing 
boats and country scenes 
a blockbuster exhibit of his most famous artworks is the 
centerpiece of a fourmonth extravaganza commemorating the 100th 
anniversary of the dutch impressionists death more than 380 van 
gogh paintings and drawings insured for a record 31 billion are 
on display in two dutch museums 
they include self portrait with bandaged ear starry 
night and night cafe as well as dozens of drawings so 
vulnerable to light that they have never been shown in public 
according to the events organizers 
along with the exhibit in amsterdams vincent van gogh museum 
and the kroellermueller museum in the central netherlands town of 
otterlo the commemorative program includes a dozen other art 
exhibitions an opera and a film festival 
commemorative posters by 20 contemporary artists including 
czechoslovak jiri kolar dutchman willem de kooning and american 
roy lichtenstein have been run off to help offset the 115 million 
exhibition cost 
lots of people can relate to van goghs artworks because 
theyre so full of color but his life fascinates people too 
said madeleine wardenaar of the van gogh 1990 foundation which is 
organizing the program hes really the romantic artist with 
drama playing a part in every period of his life 
born on march 30 1853 in the southern netherlands village of 
zundert van gogh struggled with poverty loneliness and periodic 
bouts of madness until he died after firing a rifle into his chest 
on july 29 1890 
during his troubled life van gogh rode an emotional 
rollercoaster after he mutilated himself by removing his ear he 
said the bible had instructed him to cut off the offending 
organ 
one of his closest relationships was with the french painter 
paul gauguin with whom he had an affair they spent endless hours 
arguing 
van gogh also was a voluminous letter writer during that 
444day period in 188889 he wrote about 200 letters 
in a sept 19 1888 letter to his brother theo van gogh 
describes starry night 
the sky is bluegreen the water is royal blue the soil is 
mauve the city is blue and violet the gas light yellow on 
the bluegreen field of the sky the great bear sparkling green and 
pink a reflection whose modest shine contrasts with the powerful 
gold of the gas light two colorful figures of a lovers couple on 
the foreground 
the painting in which the artist departed from his usual method 
of applying small dots of contrasting colors on the cloth to form a 
pattern has bold linear brush strokes 
van gogh enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists 
during his lifetime but experts disagree whether he sold three 
paintings or just one according to wardenaar 
today his works fetch record prices at art auctions around the 
globe his irises became the most expensive work ever auctioned 
when sothebys sold it for 5390 million on nov 11 1987 the 
painting subsequently was sold to the getty museum in malibu 
calif after australian tycoon alan bond could not repay a loan 
sothebys had posted for the sale 
sunflowers went for 3992 million in march 1987 the 
trinquetalle bridge brought 2024 million in a june 1987 auction 
the van gogh exhibit is expected to attract 15 million visitors 
the amsterdam museum home of the worlds largest van gogh 
collection will display 135 paintings including 80 borrowed from 
museums and private collections in paris london new york boston 
moscow and zurich a total of 248 van gogh drawings and watercolors 
are going on display in the museum in otterlo 62 miles from the 
dutch capital 
despite the theft in otterlo of three van gogh paintings in 
1988 the exhibits organizers had little trouble getting the works 
they wanted from foreign lenders wardenaar said 
the stolen paintings recovered unharmed several months later 
included an early version of van goghs famous the potato 
eaters their total worth was estimated at more than 105 
million 
security during transport and the exhibit itself is expected to 
be extremely tight although no details are being disclosed 
wardenaar said the huge insurance package is costing organizers 
21 million and will cover only the borrowed artworks those owned 
by the dutch museums are uninsured in line with culture ministry 
policy 
the centenary exhibit is organized along the thematic lines that 
van gogh himself described in the hundreds of letters he wrote to 
his brother from france where he lived most of his life 
he said quite explicitly in the letters how he wanted his 
paintings displayed wardenaar said adding the exhibit will 
include some works in several versions in order to illustrate their 
development 
in an april 21 1888 letter to the painter emile bernard van 
gogh wrote from the southern french city of arles 
heres a new orchard fairly simple in composition a white 
tree a small green tree a square bit of green a purple patch of 
soil an orange roof a large blue sky i have nine more orchards 
coming a white a pink an almost red a bluewhite and pink and 
gray a green and a pink one yesterday i botched a cloth a 
cherry tree against a blue sky the sprouting leaves were orange 
and gold the flower clusters white all that against the 
bluegreen of the sky it was simply wonderful 
also part of the centenary extravaganza is an opera by the dutch 
composer jan van vlijmen unhappy man dressed in black which 
focuses on the final years of the artists life 
in the western city of haarlem there will be an exhibit of 75 
works by the 17th century dutch master frans hals whom van gogh 
strongly admired including works on loan from the national gallery 
in washington and the royal academy in london several exhibitions 
in amsterdam and elsewhere will illustrate van goghs effect on 
contemporary artists 
the van gogh anniversary also has attracted mass merchandising 
american express is offering a van gogh bust by dutch artist theo 
melchior it sells for 490 there also are van gogh wines 
aftershave lotion tshirts watches and goldframed prints of his 
paintings for 630 each 
dutch companies sponsoring the van gogh centenary are setting up 
a van gogh village to promote their products on amsterdams 
museum square although wardenaar said everything was being done to 
make the display as dignified as possible 
the centenary exhibit runs through july 29 tickets on sale by 
ticketron in the united states and available in some european 
countries sell for 1250 each and must be ordered in advance 
they will give access to one of the museums at a specific time and 
date although visitors can then stay as long as they want

ken wilkie believes his 18 years of digging for 
facts about vincent van gogh lights up hitherto dark places in the 
life and loves of the worlds most popular artist 
i looked in the places no one had bothered with before like 
the telephone book said wilkie whose new book about his quest 
the van gogh file was recently published 
in the netherlands museums are busy preparing exhibitions of 
paintings and drawings by van gogh to mark the centennial of the 
dutch artist whose works have become the most expensive in art 
history 
van gogh was poor all his life and could not sell his work but 
in eight months in 1987 three paintings by him of irises 
sunflowers and a bridge sold for 114 million 
at one time van goghs paintings were used for target practice 
wilkie said he discovered that at st remy mental hospital where 
van gogh was a voluntary patient in 1889 the son of the doctor in 
charge and a friend used the artists canvasses that he had left 
behind as targets for their bows and arrows 
only much later when van gogh became so famous did they 
realize what they had destroyed wilkie said he said he was told 
of the archery targets by the grandson of van goghs guard at the 
hospital 
wilkie tracked down the man and others connected with van gogh 
through telephone calls in the netherlands belgium england and 
france where the artist lived during his 37 years 
i called people of the same name in the telephone book said 
wilkie 47 a scottish journalist from dundee who lives in 
amsterdam 
the book revises and updates his first book on the artist in 
1978 the van gogh assignment which evolved from an article he 
was asked to write in 1972 
his first break in 1972 was a chance meeting with vincent willem 
van gogh then 83 son of the artists brother theo 
willem was a year old when he was held in the arms of vincent 
who shot himself two months later wilkie said all the old 
people i spoke to in the first few years are now dead 
he listed his most important discoveries as a drawing by van 
gogh of the house in london where he lodged in 1873 a photograph 
of eugenie loyer the landladys daughter who rejected van goghs 
offer of marriage and the information out that vincent and theo 
were both treated for syphilis 
eugenies rejection had a profound effect on the course of van 
goghs immediate life and the disease explains many curious 
actions of the brothers said wilkie 
vincent was fired from his job in a london art dealers after 
he began telling the customers what he really thought of the 
rubbish on the walls he then became obsessed with religion and 
feelings of compassion for the poor wilkie said i think the 
syphilis was responsible for his schizophrenia and fits and for 
theo dying paralyzed and insane six months after vincent 
wilkie said that by going to places where van gogh had been he 
uncovered things that arent in art history books 
there are scores of art history books about van gogh but they 
tend to rely on what other art historians have written he said 
in south london at 87 hackford road a blue plaque on a 
threestory row house records that van gogh lived there in 187374 
arthur smith a retired sanitary inspector who is the current 
occupant said nothing remains of the artist except an old outdoor 
toilet that he probably used 
we get film crews and lots of japanese tourists and we get 
nothing for it he said we cant even park the car 
do you think i could auction the blue plaque

its important nick lowe says for 
musicians to have a sense of humor hes hoping english pop star 
rick astley feels the same way 
thats because astley and his hit song never gonna give you 
up is the subject of a verse on all men are liars a cut on 
lowes new album since lowe rhymes astley with ghastly 
its not exactly a tribute 
i didnt really go after him i went after this horrible song 
that he sang never going to tell a lie never going to do 
anything horrible to you im always going to be this lump of 
jelly this pathetic creature lowe said 
they tell me ive never met rick that hes a very nice man 
and will think this is quite amusing lowe said i hope so 
lowes humor sometimes perverse sometimes cornball is never 
far from the surface this is a man whos written songs such as 
time wounds all heels and hey big mouth stand up and say 
that when david bowie released an album called low lowe 
retaliated with bowi 
critics however accuse lowe of being glib and not showing 
enough care in his craft for every joke that hits several fall 
flat after two minor classic albums in the late 1970s and a hit 
single with cruel to be kind lowes name hasnt been seen on 
too many record charts 
the back cover of lowes 1987 pinker and prouder than 
previous album shows lowe with his back to a brick wall gazing 
mournfully at an outofreach sign that said marketplace not 
many people noticed the irony since few people bought the record 
ive made some really terrible records lowe conceded 
ive done my best but if youre no good youre no good thats 
the way it goes 
the 40yearold liverpool native said he spent much of the last 
two years watching television suffering from a crisis of 
confidence 
i went through a pretty desperate time he said my band 
packed in i couldnt work out how i fit into the music 
business how is it that on paper im a washedup old hasbeen 
yet personally i feel i havent started yet 
lowe who favors country and bluesinflected records that sound 
as if they were cut live in the studio said he watched with dismay 
as music became more mechanized through the 1980s music by 
typists he called it 
his first step in a comeback came when pal elvis costello 
invited lowe to be an opening act on a solo acoustic tour standing 
in front of an audience with just a guitar teaches you quickly 
whether a song is working or not he said it made him take the 
craft of songwriting more seriously he said 
and luckily for lowe in the audience for a solo show at 
londons mean fiddler club was an old friend warner bros records 
executive andrew wickham lowes contract with columbia records in 
the united states had just run out 
it was a tough crowd a lot of hecklers and drunken 
irishmen wickham recalled he won them over immediately just 
through sheer wit he held the room he commanded the room its 
not many people who can do that thats one of the main reasons why 
i signed him 
lowe quips that he sneaked into warner bros on elvis 
costellos coattails costello whos had several of his albums 
produced by lowe recently switched from columbia records to warner 
bros 
the 11 compositions on party of one are the same frothy pop 
confections for which lowe is known despite songs such as jumbo 
ark and shtingshtang lowes choice of colleagues shows a 
seriousness of purpose hes not always had dave edmunds produced 
party of one and ry cooder and jim keltner also performed 
lowe likes material that is funny even when its not overtly 
comical the sneak attack on astley is not unprecedented his first 
album similarly ridiculed the bay city rollers 
i can only do and say what i think he said ill get up 
some peoples noses perhaps but if i get up some peoples noses 
theyve really got to be insecure 
in the course of a 30minute interview he mocks phil collins 
why doesnt he just get out of the way and let someone else have 
a go richard marx and bad english and nick lowe 
for instance he said the songs on basher his recent 
compilation cd were chosen by taking a list of all the songs hes 
ever recorded and crossing out all the ones that under no 
circumstances did we want to be reminded of 
commercial success is nice but hes not willing to sell his 
soul for it lowe said it heartens him to see someone whose work 
he respects does well such as when bonnie raitt won four grammy 
awards last month 
i spoke to her last week and shes cool enough not to be cool 
about it he said shes just grooving out she was so 
charming i said to her bonnie this is great for all of us you 
getting rich it makes all of us look cool if people find out that 
i hang around with you its going to make me look fabulous 
lowe has no band now but hes thinking about forming one to 
tour later this year he turned down an invitation to join edmunds 
tour with dion graham parker and kim wilson because he didnt 
think his old friend would be able to organize it 
hes philosophic about how party of one will fare 
i hope people will hear it because its got the ring of truth 
about it he said if they dont too bad well just do 
another

the academic world has hardly finished licking 
its wounds from allan blooms runaway best seller the closing of 
the american mind 
blooms premise which fit perfectly the collegebashing mood of 
the 1980s orchestrated by former us secretary of education 
william bennett held that all was well on us campuses until the 
60s when students began asking rude questions called ancient 
verities mere opinions and even placed mick jagger and his ilk 
above blooms beloved plato and aristotle as popular icons 
now comes a more radical and even bleaker broadside aimed at 
academe killing the spirit higher education in america 
viking press 1995 by the historian page smith 
no smith says all was not well at us colleges before the 
60s any talk of the good old days simply doesnt jibe with 
the history of higher education in this country 
the crisis afflicting americas campuses is nothing new writes 
smith nor he admits are his criticisms 
he proceeds in this powerful work to add fresh and fascinating 
detail to the history of higher education what we learn is that 
from its colonial beginnings to this day the system has been 
fundamentally flawed fostering in students and teachers alike a 
leaden conformity over creativity 
and in its obeisance to the great god science college education 
has lost its direction and its soul 
im not optimistic about piecemeal reforms at this stage 
smith said in a telephone interview from his home in santa cruz 
calif where he writes a syndicated column on old age and is an 
emeritus professor at the university of californiasanta cruz 
smith was the founding provost of ucsanta cruz and author of 
numerous historical works including an eightvolume history of the 
united states 
he said he was moved to write killing the spirit after he 
learned of an aspiring college teacher who almost saw his career 
hopes derailed by his academic judges because he invoked the name 
of a german historian eugen rosenstockhuessy whose ideas were 
considered heretical 
by coincidence smith had been initially denied for graduate 
work at harvard 40 years earlier because he had studied under 
rosenstockhuessy and had similarly invoked that historians name 
to the chagrin of harvards history department 
it occurred to smith that colleges were not and never have 
been the marketplaces of ideas many believe them to be 
instead schools have long practiced what he calls academic 
fundamentalism meaning woe to any student or teacher with the 
courage to stray from the intellectual orthodoxy of the moment 
i thought my god can the academic world be that rigid that 
doctrinaire smith said indeed it can he argues 
none of academias sacred cows escapes smiths critical lance 
the tenure system requires that teachers publish mountains of 
useless research academic departments are intellectually 
stultifying and command a teachers first loyalty the lecture 
system is simply an unnatural and boring way of transmitting 
knowledge the social nonsciences and the inhuman 
humanities as smith dubs them have sold their ouls in their 
wholly unsuccessful efforts to be viewed as science with a capital 
s 
he calls anthropology arguably the funniest academic 
discipline there is something faintly ridiculous about a sober 
white anthropologist asking impertinent questions of quizzical 
aborigines and writing down the answers 
of both anthropology and sociology smith writes the 
treatment of people as objects of scrutiny scientific or not is 
when one thinks about it pretty deplorable 
psychology supposedly the study of the human psyche the soul 
has denied the existence of the soul as unscientific and in 
this soulless state smith says psychology has much to answer for 
lobotomies shock therapy involuntary drug experimentation and the 
perfection of ways to manipulate people into buying things they 
dont want or need 
history in one of its latest pseudoscientific form is called 
cliometrics by its practitioners who feed voting data property 
rolls and the like into computers one egregious result of such 
historical number crunching was a 1974 work time on the cross 
which purported to show with charts and graphs that most american 
slaves were happy and that slavery as an institution had merely 
gotten a bad press 
and economics is no more a science than the other social 
nonsciences no matter how hard it contends otherwise it 
has in the final analysis to deal with human behavior and human 
behavior remains maddeningly unpredictable fortunately smith 
writes 
and in a chapter certain to raise feminist hackles smith says 
womens studies that mushroomed on campuses since the 60s are 
clearly out of hand 
the image that women students carry away with them on 
graduation must be of a world hopelessly divided into exploiting 
males and oppressed females he writes 
professors meanwhile complain about the publish or perish 
system they also complain about their teaching load which 
over the years has grown ever lighter one wonders what these 
seemingly misanthropic souls want besides their sabbaticals 
interestingly smith singles out community colleges for praise 
teachers in such schools have a sense of mission and closeness to 
their students too often lacking in loftier institutions he says 
smiths book is descriptive in the manner of the historian it 
is no blueprint for reform it offers only the broadest 
prescription a belief in smaller more personal colleges that 
somehow reconcile the scientific with the spiritual

country music performer earl thomas 
conley says it feels good to get wrapped up in a song and cry 
and conley whos been at the top of the country charts for the 
past decade has broken down a few times on stage and in the 
recording studio 
you get so caught up that you are convinced he said in an 
interview thats when its really nice you are totally relating 
to it 
his songs about love yearning and hardships are familiar fare 
on the nartions 2100 country music radio stations 
the introspective philosophical conley has an impressive 18 no 
1 records to his credit since his first one in 1981 fire and 
ice he has two greatest hits albums 
but the 48yearold performer is not content 
you get lazy when you get satisfied conley said youre 
asleep when youre satisfied then you wake up and your career is 
over because you are only as strong as the record you have out at 
the time 
you can work in this business for five years on what you have 
done but the idea is to pretend you are never going to quit that 
way you get better with each endeavor that way you continue to 
grow and be refreshing 
and you continue to be totally alive in your music and in your 
life period i think you always need a challenge 
conley was the third of eight children born to a railroad worker 
in portsmouth ohio the family was poor and he wore handmedowns 
he wanted to paint pictures but gravitated toward country music 
while in the army later he began writing songs during a series of 
factory and steel mill jobs in ohio during breaks on his job at a 
steel mill he played his guitar in the locker room 
for a long time he commuted to nashville every few months 
trying vainly to generate interest in his work in 1970 he moved 
to huntsville ala and again worked at manual labor while singing 
in nightclubs seven nights a week 
he finally moved to nashville in 1973 signed a recording 
contract and became a country music favorite singing 
thoughtprovoking songs he wrote himself 
in 1984 his album dont make it easy for me had four no 1 
singles the title cut holding her and loving you your 
loves on the line and angel in disguise 
his other hit records include somewhere between right and 
wrong i have loved you girl chance of loving you 
nobody falls like a fool what id say and right from the 
start 
hes also been successful singing duets joining emmylou harris 
on the no 1 country record we believe in happy endings in 
1988 he also sang a duet with anita pointer of the pointer 
sisters too many times which was the title cut of his 1986 
album 
he said one reason hes done well is because of his attention to 
originality 
i always look for new ways of doing things if i write a 
waltz the next thing i do is as far opposite as i can find and i 
usually dont go back and review my old material or anyone elses 
instead i look for a new way to do things and new ways of feeling 
things he said 
despite his steady success hes rarely received an award for 
his music hes gone largely unnoticed at awards shows while 
country performers like randy travis hank williams jr and george 
strait packed their trophy cases 
its disappointing conley said there are other people 
doing good things in this industry but it seems like people turn 
their eyes to them and not me 
in the meantime though conley has been fighting a singers 
nightmare voice trouble he took 2 months off the road last fall 
because of a strained voice and bronchitis early this year he 
rescheduled concert dates for six weeks because of a recurrence of 
the problem a biopsy was considered at one point but ruled out as 
unnecessary

for the second consecutive year the television 
ratings leader in prime time is taking on a partner in a promotion 
designed to drum up viewers for its new fall season 
the national broadcasting cos nbc television network and 
mcdonalds corp the king of fast food said monday they would 
team up on a gamelike promotion this fall that they said would be 
the most extensive ever for tv reaching a potential 60 million 
people daily 
the companies declined to provide details of the effort saying 
they didnt want to give competitors a chance to copy it 
nbc and cbs each had joint promotions with major retailers last 
fall the networks say they have had to become more aggressive in 
getting people to look at their shows because of the growing 
competition from independent stations cable television and 
programs and films on videocassettes 
last fall nbc had a joint promotion with sears roebuck amp co 
the nations largest retailer that gave viewers a chance to win 
trips to hollywood to be on nbc programs plus other assorted prizes 
cbs had a joint promotion with k mart corp last fall and may 
offer another promotion with the michiganbased retailer this year 
according to cbs senior vice president george schweitzer 
some advertising executies have questioned the value of such 
promotions but cbs and nbc executives say last years efforts 
boosted awareness of their programs and encouraged more people to 
tune in at least once 
last years promotion was highly successful for cbs and for k 
mart schweitzer said he said cbss ratings for season premieres 
last fall were up 28 percent from the previous year when the start 
of the season was delayed by a writers strike and 10 percent from 
1987 when the season started on time 
schweitzer said the promotion also helped k mart post its 
biggest sales gain of the year during the threeweek period 
mary jean houde a spokeswoman for chicagobased sears said 
sears felt its promotion with nbc last year brought more customers 
into the store even though sales in stores open at least a year 
fell 18 percent last september compared with the previous year 
she said the decline in socalled comparable store sales the 
indicator many analysts use to gauge how a retailer is doing 
reflected weakness in appliance and furniture sales rather than any 
problem with the promotion 
she declined to comment on sears plans for promotions this 
year but said we dont often repeat a specific promotional 
event 
nbc and mcdonalds said their effort has the potential to reach 
many more people every day than either the nbcsears or cbsk mart 
promotions did 
with 209 affiliates nbc said its schedule of shows can reach 42 
million viewers nightly while mcdonalds serves 17 million 
customers a day at its 8400 us restaurants 
john miller executive vice president for marketing at nbctv 
said last years promotion with sears did increase sampling 
somewhat although not as much as we would have liked 
nonetheless he said nbc gained valuable experience that it 
hopes to use this year 
he said about 3 million people entered last years promotion and 
that this year it was hoped considerably more maybe a million a 
day would enter 
mcdonalds has conducted a number of promotions itself in recent 
years including games based on the board games monopoly and 
scrabble and giveaways linked to the movies the little mermaid

atampt has entered the crowded credit card 
business with mastercard and visa cards that promise no annual fees 
and offer a discount on longdistance calls 
the atampt universal card can be used to charge longdistance 
phone calls on the companys telephone network as well as the 
traditional goods and services billed to charge cards 
the phone giant kicked off an advertising blitz during monday 
nights academy awards broadcast to highlight some of the cards 
features including 
no annual fee ever for customers who sign up his year and make 
at least one purchase annually 
rentalcar insurance purchase protection and extended product 
warranties which usually are provided exclusively with gold 
bank credit cards aimed at highincome customers 
a 10 percent discount from the regular creditcard rate on 
phone calls charged to the card 
the card carries an annual interest rate of 89 percentage 
points above the prime rate which currently is 10 percent credit 
card and phone call charges will appear on the same bill 
american telephone amp telegraph co officials said the card would 
be offered to those of its 70 million longdistance phone 
subscribers who pass credit checks 
for customers who choose it the universal card will supplant 
the existing atampt phone card which only can be used to charge 
calls about 40 million phone cards are in circulation 
some industry analysts praised the move by the nations largest 
longdistance phone company 
youve got a company with a very wellknown name and already 
in the wallets of a lot of people trying to expand that wallet 
share into the most profitable segment of financial services 
said mark lynch who follows the banking industry for bear stearns 
amp co 
but spencer nilson publisher of a trade letter on the credit 
card industry said atampt would have a hard time making a profit 
without charging an annual fee 
nilson said he believed the move was motivated more by atampts 
need to hang on to its longdistance customers who increasingly 
are being lured away by mci communications corp and us sprint the 
no 2 and 3 longdistance carriers 
from this perspective nilson called the credit cards a very 
smart move 
in december us sprint began issuing a sprint visa card that 
also acts as a phone charge card the card carries a 25 annual 
fee the company said its motivation was to increase the use of its 
phone network 
mci has said it has no plans to issue credit cards 
atampt will issue its cards through universal bank a subsidiary 
of synovus financial corp a bank holding company based in 
columbus ga total system services inc a credit card service 
company controlled by synovus will process the transactions from 
the cards 
under its agreement with synovus atampt will share profits and 
buy card receivables the money owed from customer charges 
receivables frequently are bundled into securities that are traded 
like bonds on wall street 
atampt also has the right to buy up to 15 million newly issued 
shares of total system services stock the company has 159 million 
shares outstanding 
to run the credit card operation atampt hired scores of credit 
card industry veterans including paul kahn former head of first 
chicago corps card division who will run the new division 
atampt originally considered issuing its own credit card to 
compete with mastercard and visa but backed out after market 
research showed consumers wanted to consolidate their cards rather 
than have another one kahn told reporters at a news conference 
industry analysts said fierce competition in the creditcard 
industry also may have dissuaded atampt from the plan 
sears roebuck and cos discover card was the last separate 
card to break into the industry and the retailer endured several 
years of steep losses before it turned the operation around 
alex w hart president and chief executive officer of 
mastercard international said the atampt card could steal customers 
away from other issuers of mastercard and visa however he said 
the atampt card should expand the overall market share for those 
cards

finding a successor to its late founder an wang 
should not be as difficult for wang laboratories inc as it may be 
for the company to rebound from recent losses and regain customer 
confidence 
the board of directors of the lowellbased company is scheduled 
to meet wednesday to discuss who will succeed wang as chairman and 
chief executive officer 
wang who struggled against cancer for months died saturday at 
age 70 
but while the company has struggled recently analysts said the 
company already made an important leadership change last year when 
it named richard miller as president miller took the job from 
wangs son frederick wang who was ousted after the companys 
fortunes tumbled 
analysts expect miller to take the ceo job and possibly ascend 
to chairman 
in a statement after his fathers death frederick wang said on 
behalf of his family we support rick miller and the other 
members of the wang management team in their efforts to build a 
strong and growing company 
the statement said the family believes that the longterm plan 
now being implemented to return the company to profitability will 
achieve its objectives 
under the leadership of the companys founder wang became a 
multibilliondollar company largely as a pioneer in word 
processors but analysts said the company stumbled when it failed 
to react quickly to the growth in personal computers which largely 
replaced the need for word processors 
the company moved into the midrange computer market but that 
segment has been slumping and wang posted a 4243 million loss 
for the year that ended last june 30 
since miller a former general electric co executive took over 
in august he slashed the work force and sold off assets to reduce 
the companys debt 
wang now employs about 22500 people compared with 28000 at 
the end of the last fiscal year its bank debt has shrunk from 575 
million to under 100 million 
also under miller wang has moved out of its closed or 
proprietary products and said it will make more equipment that 
uses increasingly popular industrywide standards this strategy is 
part of millers plan to make wang more responsive to customer 
needs 
i think the big changes have already occurred said fred 
pastore an analyst at moodys investors service inc i think we 
will see a much more focused wang 
wang has made the kind of moves the company needs to make to 
survive said steven wendler an analyst at the research firm 
gartner group inc 
wang is becoming better aligned with the market wendler said 
but miller still must solve the companys poor history of customer 
service that has left many clients unhappy 
while some analysts speculate that wang could become a takeover 
target wendler described the customer service as an achilles 
heel that could dissuade potential suitors 
wang has a large installed base but its an unhappy installed 
base wendler said if youre an investor you look at it like 
damaged goods 
the long term for wang is still very cloudy he said 
in the company statement the wang family said it intends to 
retain their ownership position in the company the family 
effectively has control over the company with the power to elect 
threequarters of the board of directors 
part of wangs longterm strategy is to concentrate on image 
processing in which computers store and manipulate the actual 
images of documents analysts say the market for image processing 
is expected to grow to 3 billion annually in the next few years

federal officials say they are protecting 
competition by blocking gillette co from acquiring the wilkinson 
blade and razor business in the united states 
gillette officials say the federal action is not a serious 
setback insisting their main interest is in wilkinsons business 
in other parts of the world 
gillette and the us justice department announced a settlement 
monday in which gillette dropped its plans to acquire the us 
razor business of wilkinson 
the action follows statements last year by bush administration 
officials that the government intends to promote competition 
through tighter enforcement of antitrust laws 
gillette the world leader in the razor industry announced in 
december it was helping finance a buyout of wilkinsons swedish 
owner under the deal gillette said it would acquire the wilkinson 
blade and razor business outside of europe 
gillette also said it would gain nonvoting interest in the newly 
created netherlands company eemland management services bv which 
would retain the european wilkinson business as well as worldwide 
match and lighter operations 
but the justice department filed an antitrust suit in january 
saying the deal could reduce competition in the united states and 
hurt consumers 
gillette officials said that after the suit was filed the 
company indicated it would not acquire the wilkinson us business 
and under the settlement gillette agreed not to do so in the 
future 
we felt it did not violate the antitrust law we still feel it 
doesnt said david fausch a gillette spokesman but he said 
gillette did not consider wilkinsons us business large enough to 
justify a lengthy and costly court case 
gillette said the settlement would not affect any other aspect 
of the transaction wilkinsons us business will remain under the 
control of the netherlands company fausch said 
the proposed final judgment would permit wilkinson sword to 
remain an efficient and independent competitor in the united states 
market james f rill assistant us attorney general said in a 
statement 
under the proposed settlement which must be approved in court 
gillette also would be prevented from acquiring wilkinsons 
production facilities in europe that are used to supply the united 
states 
the agreement also would bar eemland from transferring 
trademarks to gillette for blades sold in the united states or 
europe furthermore it would prohibit gillette from acting as 
eemlands agent for the us razor market and would prevent 
gillette from acquiring more equity in eemland the government said 
gillette said its principal purpose was to develop the global 
potential of the wilkinson brand outside the european community and 
the united states 
brenda landry an analyst at morgan stanley in new york said 
the action should not be a big setback to gillette noting that 
wilkinson represents about 3 percent of the us razor market 
the us is peanut business she said

the firing of a securities analyst who had 
criticized donald trumps newest casino project shows that 
brokerages sometimes face pressures to provide less than objective 
investment advice industry observers said 
janney montgomery scott inc confirmed monday it had terminated 
marvin roffman in the wake of negative comments he made to the wall 
street journal about the taj mahal casino resort in atlantic city 
nj 
this should make the individual investor more skeptical about 
wall street research said james j cramer president of cramer amp 
co an investment management firm in new york 
most people think analysts are independent understand their 
industries and do tough analysis cramer said its just not 
true most analysts cant afford to be independent 
janney montgomery said roffman was fired for violating company 
policies not because of his negative public comments about the taj 
mahal 
nevertheless cramer said roffmans situation would serve as a 
warning to other analysts that they have to recommend the stocks 
their firm wants to recommend regardless of their own conclusions 
some others agreed 
wall street firms are such idiots about not telling 
investors bad news said michael murphy editor of the overprice 
stock service newsletter in san francisco they will only tell 
investors good news 
he said janney montgomery made a dumb decision and his own 
firm agreed with roffman that the taj mahal will open at a time 
when the gaming industry has overcapacity 
by firing the guy who has thought about this done his 
homework come to a conclusion and put it out there theyre really 
interfering in the efficiency of the capital markets murphy said 
robert sobel a professor of business history at hofstra 
university in hempstead ny said similar actions have been taken 
against analysts and stockbrokers before but they usually have not 
been disclosed publicly 
this is not going to burnish donald trumps image or the 
companys sobel said if i had an account with that company 
id leave i couldnt trust their research 
but andrew gray iii president of the new york society of 
security analysts said roffmans firing was an aberration if a 
bad one 
it sort of defeats the purpose of paying someone to determine 
whether a vehicle is a good investment or a bad or something in 
between he said 
trump has issued 675 million in mortgage bonds to finance the 
taj mahal which would have to gross 1 million daily to cover 
interest costs and operating expenses 
the journal quoted roffman in its march 20 editions as saying 
the casino initially would flourish but once the cold winds blow 
from october to february it wont make it the market just isnt 
there 
trump demanded roffman issue a letter of public apology janney 
montgomery ordered the analyst do so to take a pay cut and to stop 
talking to reporters according to roffman 
roffman said he initially signed a letter seeking trumps 
forgiveness for what has turned out to be a very unfortunate 
interview on my part but he retracted that statement in a second 
letter saying he signed the first letter under extremely 
stressful conditions 
trump said monday that janney montgomery fired roffman of its 
own volition 
norman t wilde jr president of janney montgomery issued a 
statement monday saying roffman was fired because he had been 
advised in writing not to send his second letter 
roffman violated janney montgomery policies in making comments 
to the news media about the taj mahal before clearing them with top 
company officials and by not disseminating the recommendations 
broadly to the firms clients first wilde said 
mr roffman was well aware of these policies and had been 
admonished in the past on more than one occasion to follow those 
policies wilde said 
philadelphiabased janney montgomery a wholly owned subsidiary 
of penn mutual life insurance co has 1050 employees and 40 
offices 
roffman said he had received dozens of telephone calls of 
support from around the country 
everyones saying we support you 100 percent in what youre 
doing if an analyst does research and comes out with a negative 
opinion theres no reason he should be silenced roffman said 
asked if were considering a lawsuit against his former employer 
roffman said i have an attorney and it is one of our options

michelango used it to create masterpieces and it 
helped make the worlds fifthlargest building a landmark but the 
italian marble covering the amoco building appears destined for 
doom 
despite hundreds of offers to use the 16 acres of carrara marble 
covering the building for items such as pen holders and pool decks 
amoco oil co officials say it likely will be turned into rubble 
starting this may 
thats when workers are scheduled to begin removing the 43000 
marble panels that form the facade of the majestic white building 
and replacing them with granite as a safety precaution 
offers to save the marble proved too costly and raised liability 
questions said company officials who are considering either 
tossing the marble into a landfill or breaking it up into gravel 
were down to those final two options amoco spokesman mike 
thompson said monday 
the marble covers the 1136foot downtown building in 45inch 
long panels about 1inch thick each weighing 275 pounds that 
amounts to 5900 tons of glossy white marble which helped make the 
17yearold building a distinctive landmark among the citys 
skyscrapers 
but planners didnt foresee the effects of chicagos mercurial 
weather on the panels which have warped and fractured in the 
deepfreeze of winter and summers scorching sun 
michelangelo used the same type of marble quarried in the 
carrara mountains of northcentral italy but he didnt leave his 
work outside chicago architect walter netsch once noted 
fearing that the panels could come loose and turn into deadly 
projectiles amoco announced a year ago that they were being 
removed and replaced with granite 
everybody ive talked to says its such a shame said paul 
peterson one of hundreds of people whose offers were rejected by 
amoco peterson a chicago attorney and former artist had tried to 
persuade amoco to donate the stone veneer to a venture using 
handicapped people to make marble mementos 
another offer came from a homeowner who wanted to see if he 
could get some marble for a pooldecking thompson said but the 
marble is super slick when wet and amoco didnt want to be held 
responsible for any accidents 
theres serious liability questions here thompson said 
it has taken a year to prepare the building for the removal 
which will cost between 60 million and 80 million thompson said 
the company expects all the marble to be gone and the granite in 
place by the middle of 1992 
though saltandpepper colored up close the granite appears 
white from afar and will maintain the buildings distinctive 
appearance amoco officials say 
the offers to make use of the marble came from schools churches 
and even the citys park district which proposed using the stone 
to build a facade along the chicago river peterson said 
cost made most of the offers prohibitive said shelby pierce 
engineering manager of the amoco oil co subsidiary and 
coordinator of the removal project 
during the removal if the contractor is instructed to keep 
the marble intact and try to avoid breaking it were going to 
have to pay a premium on it he said 
the contractors would like to break it in the middle to 
facilitate the removal but that would destroy the marble for any 
other use pierce said 
peterson is not convinced that amoco has explored all the 
options for the marble and said hes encouraging others to come up 
with suggestions for the stuff 
but amoco officials say the case is closed 
its unfortunate pierce said but well be glad to get 
the granite up

jaguar plc chairman sir john egan said tuesday he 
would leave the luxury auto maker in june seven months after it 
was taken over by ford motor co 
egan 50 said he has not yet decided what he will do when he 
leaves the company 
he is to be replaced by william hayden currently vice president 
of manufacturing for ford of europe hayden 61 has been leading 
fords transition team at jaguar since the 26 billion takeover in 
november 
it is exactly 10 years since my appointment as chairman of 
jaguar and during that time i have concentrated on the rescue and 
recovery of a fine british car company egan said 
he said he had been delighted that ford had acquired jaguar and 
was encouraged by fords ambitious longterm plans ford plans to 
substantially increase jaguars annual production of 50000 
i consider i have made my best contribution to jaguar and my 
advice to ford was that the big growth opportunities available to 
jaguar under their ownership could only be fully exploited if the 
company was led by a senior ford executive he said 
egan has been credited with steering the auto maker through a 
successful privatization in 1984 and improving the companys 
fortunes 
he had wanted to retain jaguars independence and had discussed 
possible cooperation deals with many car makers 
in the governments hands jaguar had developed a poor 
reputation for quality and reliability and sales had suffered 
worldwide particularly in the united states

the government on tuesday referred british airways 
plcs purchase of a 20 percent stake in sabena world airlines to 
the monopolies commission for a review of its impact on air service 
to and from britain 
the referral made by the department of trade and industry on 
the recommendation of britains office of fair trading puts at 
risk a major strategic move by british airways 
the airline had hoped to use the tie with belgiums sabena sa to 
create an additional hub for its european and transatlantic 
flights 
european airlines have been scrambling to form links with each 
other and with us and asian airlines to better compete as the air 
travel industry becomes increasingly global and deregulated these 
links have raised concerns about their effects on competition 
the trade department said the commissions investigation would 
not involve the 20 percent sabena stake bought by klm royal dutch 
airlines at the same time the british airways link was agreed to in 
december 
british airways and klm each are paying the equivalent of 57

japanese legislators meeting with us officials 
tuesday balked at american demands that they enact broad economic 
reforms to help shrink the us deficit in trade with japan 
japanese members of the japanus parliamentarians league told 
us ambassador to japan michael armacost and other us embassy 
officials that reform of japans landuse policies and its retail 
distribution system would be difficult to achieve quickly 
lawmakers attending the breakfast meeting said 
at prime minister toshiki kaifus request the japanese 
government has drawn up proposals aimed at meeting us requests 
made in trade talks called the structural impediments 
initiative 
in remarks to parliament japanese officials have said the 
reforms should be undertaken for the sake of japanese consumers 
but other leaders of the governing liberal democratic party are 
less conciliatory said ldp lawmaker takujiro hamada who chaired 
the meeting 
the parliamentarians said that resistance to the reforms was 
very strong in their constituencies and that it would take a long 
time to carry out the reforms suggested by the united states in the 
trade talks hamada said 
the opinions expressed by the japanese legislators were rather 
severe said ichiji ishii another liberal democratic lawmaker 
they said the menu of us demands was much too big said 
ishii referring to reports that washington has given japan a list 
of more than 200 suggestions aimed at eliminating structural 
barriers it said prevent foreign companies from entering japanese 
markets 
us officials attending tuesdays meeting had nothing to add to 
the account given by hamada and ishii 
the united states contends that high land prices and 
inefficiencies in and restrictions on the distribution system make 
it harder for foreign businesses to enter the japanese market 
japan says problems on the us side also contribute to the trade 
imbalance 
in the latest round of trade talks last week the japanese side 
suggested the united states tax more wean itself from 
energywasting cars and limit the use of credit cards the mass 
circulation newspaper yomiuri shimbun reported 
the suggestions were among 80 proposals for cutting the federal 
budget deficit increasing savings and investment and improving 
worker training and education to boost the competitiveness of 
american exports it said 
the legislators who eventually will vote on some of the 
governments reform plans also argued that a reduction in japans 
49 billion trade surplus with the united states could be better 
carried out through other approaches including managed trade 
or exportoriented industrial policies hamada said 
he said former foreign minister shintaro abe widely seen as a 
likely candidate for prime minister stressed during the meeting 
that charges that japan had done nothing to resolve the trade 
imbalance were absolutely wrong 
it seems almost as if japan is being scolded for having such a 
powerful competitive economy hamada said 
each nation is to come up with an interim report on the sii 
talks in early april a final report is expected in july

japanese people questioned in a nationwide poll 
released thursday were almost evenly split about whether us 
criticism of japans trade policy is reasonable 
the financial newspaper nihon keizai shimbun said 474 percent 
of the 6186 people who responded to the survey said they view us 
trade complaints as basically reasonable 
this included 9 percent who said they completely agree with the 
criticisms and 384 percent who replied that the us claims are 
basically right although there are a few points that seem 
unreasonable the newspaper said 
another 329 percent of the respondents said the criticism was 
unreasonable with an additional 66 percent saying the criticism 
was completely unreasonable 
another 131 percent said they could not say if the criticism 
was reasonable or did not know 
sixtythree percent of the respondents said japan should open 
its rice market at least partially to allow the sale of foreign 
rice despite government attempts to keep japans rice market 
closed the newspaper said 
it said a minority of 311 percent said absolutely no foreign 
rice should be allowed into japan 
the governments zeroimport policy is not getting firm 
public support the newspaper commented 
in current trade talks the united states has asked japan to 
revise its landuse policies to reduce the price of land 
streamline its complicated distribution system to allow easier 
access by foreign firms and boost public works spending 
japan in turn has urged the united states to reduce its 
federal budget deficit increase its savings and investment rates 
and improve worker training and education to help boost us export 
competitiveness 
the newspaper said 859 percent of respondents said japan should 
do its best to meet the us requests for reasons such as to do 
so will benefit japan or because the usjapan relationship is 
important 
younger respondents tended to be more supportive of the us 
trade pressure the newspaper said of respondents in their 20s 
919 percent said japan should respond positively to the us 
requests 
it said 769 percent replied that the two countries 
relationship would probably either improve or retain its current 
closeness in the future 
the newspaper did not provide a margin of error for the poll 
which it said was conducted march 1619

reward for information leading to convictions for shooting at a 
greyhound bus or terminal in the drivers strike now in its fourth 
week 
the terrorism must stop p anthony lannie executive vice 
president and chief negotiator for greyhound told a news 
conference we hope the reward will bring an end to the violence 
and help lead to arrest and convictions 
union officials said greyhound was focusing on the violence 
issue as a basic tactic to avoid going back to the bargaining 
table 
as lannie announced the rewards about a halfdozen union 
members including union president edward m strait picketed 
outside the building theyre using that as a smokescreen to 
avoid coming back to the bargaining table strait said we told 
them we dont condone violence never have 
strait said violence was occuring against striking drivers as 
well and said there were at least 60 incidents where pickets have 
been injured 
strait said he was willing to return to the bargaining table at 
any time lannie said the company would not resume talks which 
broke down last sunday in tucson ariz until management had a 
hard assurance from the union that the violence would stop 
lannie said there were 2100 drivers including 400 union 
members driving greyhounds routes lannie said greyhound was 
providing 50 percent of its normal service 
greyhound said it was establishing a tollfree 800 number that 
will be in operation from 8 am to 6 pm weekdays starting at 
noon today 
a retired law enforcement officer usually a former fbi agent 
will take information and contact the appropriate law enforcement 
agency greyhound officials said 
someone fired on a bus terminal in texas and a bus was struck by 
gunfire in florida monday in the latest violent episodes no one 
was injured in either of the shootings 
meanwhile a california judge ordered striking drivers in the 
southwest not to threaten replacement drivers for the countrys 
only nationwide bus company 
a greyhound bus was hit by gunfire late monday on interstate 4 
about 30 miles west of orlando fla spokeswoman jeanne fry said 
from greyhounds dallas headquarters monday night 
the bullet destroyed the vehicles righthand mirror but none of 
the 32 passengers was injured she said 
a shot was fired earlier from a passing car at the terminal in 
amarillo texas ms fry said 
workers and passengers initially thought the sound was a car 
backfiring ms fry said but small holes were found in a window 
and police found a 20gauge shotgun cartridge in the street 
authorities said 
the incidents brought to 28 the number of shootings including 
24 on buses since the strike began march 2 according to ms fry 
superior court judge david yaffe in los angeles issued an 
injunction against intimidating workers with fear of bodily harm 
or death 
greyhound alleged that strikers had blocked or damaged buses and 
harassed replacement workers 
no attorneys appeared at the hearing for the unions southwest 
region 
nearly 6300 drivers and 3000 other greyhound workers went on 
strike after negotiators for greyhound lines inc and the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions failed to reach 
agreement on wage issues 
the company said drivers earned an average 24743 last year 
the drivers took a 22 percent pay cut three years ago before a 
leveraged buyout of the company greyhound is offering a firstyear 
raise of 69 percent 
no further negotiations are scheduled greyhound officials said

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed in early trading today on the chicago board of trade with 
corn futures slightly higher wheat slightly lower and soybeans 
fractionally mixed 
the modest strength in the corn market reflected slow farmer 
selling of corn gains were limited though by lack of 
confirmation that the soviet union recently bought us corn 
soybeans opened lower then turned mixed on buying linked to the 
continuing slow movement of soybeans and soybean products out of 
brazil and to relatively slack export demand for us soy products

rep dan rostenkowski the futures industrys 
most powerful ally in congress has all but conceded defeat in a 
battle over who should regulate trading of at least some types of 
futures contracts 
rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee 
said the cards are stacked against the chicago board of trade 
and chicago mercantile exchange the two dominate global futures 
trading and favor continued oversight by the commodity futures 
trading commission rather than by the securities and exchange 
commission 
the illinois democrat also said congress appears to favor a 
merger of the two federal regulatory agencies over proposals to 
transfer to the sec jurisdiction over only the financial futures 
markets or over stockindex futures alone 
if theres any movement at all with respect to partial 
consolidation there will be total consolidation rostenkowski 
said 
i think the cards are stacked against the members of the 
chicago trading faction 
rostenkowski commented on the situation in a meeting monday with 
the chicago tribunes editorial board his remarks were reported in 
tuesdays editions 
the cftc currently regulates all futures trading leaders of the 
chicago exchanges fear the sec which oversees stock and bond 
trading would be a stricter regulator whose actions could raise 
the cost of trading futures in the united states driving business 
overseas 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and sec chairman richard 
breeden favor giving the sec at least some of the cftcs regulatory 
authority 
the chicago mercantile exchange the worlds largest market for 
stockindex futures is opposed to any transfer of jurisdiction 
said spokesman andrew yemma 
the position advocted by some in washington of shifting 
jurisdiction to the sec we just dont consider that a negotiable 
matter yemma said in a telephone interview 
the battle over jurisdiction of the industry stems in part from 
the governments investigation of illegal trading practices at the 
merc and board of trade fortyeight people mostly traders have 
been indicted in the probe prompting criticism that the cftc has 
been lax in policing the exchanges 
the turf battle also is rooted in the belief among some experts 
that stockindex futures trading increases volatility in the stock 
market stockindex futures are contracts that represent baskets of 
stocks 
rostenkowski portrayed the fight as reflecting a rivalry between 
new york and chicago over dominance of the nations financial 
markets 
this shows the strength of the new york operators he said 
noting that brady former head of a powerful wall street firm is 
part of the eastern establishment 
sen alan dixon dill another futures industry ally on 
monday introduced a compromise bill that would put a member of each 
agency on the counterpart regulatory body 
i think crossmembership is a good idea to give each agency a 
better appreciation of the issues the other has to face dixon 
said 
the measure does not call for fundamental restructuring of our 
regulatory structure he said noting such restructuring is 
unnecessary 
the debate over jurisdiction is likely to heat up thursday when 
top regulators are expected to testify before a senate subcommittee 
headed by sen christopher dodd dconn 
dodd has said he favors shifting regulation of stockindex 
futures to the sec from the cftc

ravi batra was used to making tumultuous global 
economic forecasts and having nobody listen then some of the 
predictions started to come true 
batra is republishing his 1977 book the downfall of capitalism 
and communism this month 13 years after the indiaborn 
economist predicted the iron curtain and berlin wall would come 
down 
when i took the book around to american publishers in 1977 
they fought back laughter and said they werent interested in such 
an outrageous forecast batra said 
dr doom still is scorned by most mainstream economists but 
he no longer lacks an audience 
batra a 46yearold professor of economics at southern 
methodist university attracted international attention when his 
1987 new york times bestseller the great depression of 1990 
predicted a cataclysmic drop in the stock market for that year 
that oct 19 the dow jones average fell 506 points 
the crash helped bring batras alarming forecasts into focus he 
expounded his theories on television talk shows and was invited to 
advise a us senate committee on economic growth 
batras 1987 prophecy and a followup called surviving the 
great depression of 1990 paint worldwide unemployment deflation 
stock market crashes and bank failures beginning this year and 
lasting at least seven years 
i predicted then and i am sticking to my guns that capitalism 
and communism will both endure a complete collapse around the year 
2000 he said in a recent interview 
except for an introduction and one additional chapter 
outlining what i think will happen in the 1990s the downfall of 
capitalism and communism is exactly as i wrote it in 1977 he 
said 
britains macmillan press printed 5000 copies of the book in 
1978 now batras publishing it again via dallasbased taylor 
publishing co 
every depression starts with a recession batra said we 
are already seeing signs of a recession with the recent collapses 
of campeau and drexel burnham 
problems in the market for highrisk junk bonds pushed the us 
retailing operations of campeau corp and investment banking 
business of drexel burnham lambert into bankruptcy court earlier 
this year 
the junk bond market is in shambles and the savings and loan 
failures are magnifying unemployment is also beginning to rise and 
will probably reach 8 percent by the end of 1990 batra said 
by 1995 he said the country will be plagued with soup and 
kitchen lines worse than in the 1930s 
batra wrote in 1977 that communisms barebones living standards 
combined with the continued repression of basic freedoms will 
force marxism to crumble under its own weight perhaps in the 
next 25 years 
hes revised that scenario since communist governments began 
unraveling in the east bloc last year a result of the 
liberalizations created by soviet president mikhail gorbachev but 
batra suggested communism as a system is likely to make a last 
stand before succumbing 
soviet hardliners and army officers who have lost out in the 
recent realignment of power could take advantage of growing unrest 
and economic stagnation and overthrow gorbachev in a military 
coup the book states 
even when communism recovers to make a last stand it will 
prove to be a rearguard action delaying not stopping the 
inevitable 
batra said he hired a bodyguard after black monday in 1987 to 
protect himself from death threats he has drawn worldwide 
criticism for columns published in prominent newspapers heralding 
economic nightmares 
batra said his forecasts are born from the teachings of indian 
mentor pr sarkar a spiritualist whose writings outline a history 
of social cycles dominating history 
sarkar heads an indian sect called the path of bliss some of 
whose followers have been known to take part in rites such as 
dancing with human skulls

given current business conditions circle k corp 
may not be able to complete its restructuring without the 
protection of federal bankruptcy laws the conveniencestore chain 
says 
in an announcement late monday the company said it lost more 
than 40 million from operations during the three months ended jan 
31 
if the company does not achieve a financial restructuring it 
will not have adequate liquidity said the company which is 
staggering under the weight of 13 billion in debt 
circle k blamed a sales slump for its precarious position and 
acknowledged that its prices had been too high the company said it 
would begin cutting prices at its stores in an effort to win back 
customers 
the phoenixbased company accumulated its debt during a period 
of explosive expansion as it grew from about 1000 stores in 1984 
to 4685 just before it announced a restructuring last year 
it has been trying to obtain shortterm debt relief while 
negotiating to sell 375 stores in the pacific northwest or hawaii 
the fourpage statement said circle k continues to believe that 
a negotiated restructuring is possible however the negotiation of 
the financial restructuring involves tricky manipulation of 
deadlines it said 
some of the deadlines and demands will be difficult to meet 
and will require extension or modification if any deadline is not 
met or extended or any unsatisfied demand is not satisfactorily 
altered an impasse could result which might prevent completion of 
the negotiated restructuring circle k said 
southland corp the nations largest conveniencestore chain 
with more than 7000 units under the 7eleven banner announced 
thursday that it was selling out to a japanese company which had 
joined it as a partner in a leveraged buyout 
circle ks statement indicated a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing 
allowing federal protection during reorganization was more 
likely it also said circle k had hired merrill lynch capital 
markets a unit of the wall street firm to help work out its 
financial problems 
robert dearth jr hired as circle k president in january has 
proposed a threepoint business plan to improve the companys 
financial position 
the plan includes a price cutback improved services and product 
features and an improved mix of merchandise targeted to the needs 
of neighborhoods where the stores are located

the us dollar fell against most major currencies 
in european trading tuesday but continued its advance against the 
japanese yen 
gold prices were moderately higher after mondays slump when 
gold dropped as much as 30 an ounce amid reports of heavy middle 
eastern selling 
foreign exchange dealers said they saw no sentiment against the 
dollar and its weaker tone was due to profittaking 
they said disenchantment with the yen was continuing and the 
donward rates against the dollar also reflected fairly active 
buying of european currencies against the yen 
the british pound which sagged after a national budget 
statement a week ago was judged disappointing by business leaders 
advanced for the fourth consecutive trading session dealers said 
sterling was underpinned by the pounds advance against both the 
yen and west german mark 
dealers said the weaker yen and mark followed an apparent 
failure of japanese officials to gain us support for their 
efforts to strengthen the yen as well as the yens weakness 
against other currencies 
they said the mark was affected by uncertainty over a planned 
monetary union of the two german states and its likely impact on 
inflation 
in london one british pound cost 16255 late tuesday more 
expensive for buyers than mondays late 16135

a big institutional holder of lockheed corp 
stock decided tuesday to support texas investor harold simmons in 
simmons bid to oust the board of directors of the aerospace giant 
the decision was made by the california public employees 
retirement system a 56 billion fund that holds 500000 lockheed 
shares less than 1 percent of lockheeds stock 
the decision by calpers as it is known may carry weight far 
beyond that number however calpers is a leader among pension 
funds pushing aggressively for more input into the management of 
companies whose stock they own among other things it has asked 
companies such as lockheed to set up shareholders committees to 
advise management 
lockheed chairman daniel tellep has not committed to do that 
although he has indicated he may be leaning toward supporting 
confidential voting by stockholders one of a number of 
shareholders rights proposals to be voted on at lockheeds 
annual meeting thursday 
tellep and lockheed spokesman robert slayman did not immediately 
return a call seeking comment on the calpers move 
simmons written agreement to recommend that his slate of 
directors set up such a committee accounted for calpers decision 
said kayla gillan the retirement funds assistant general counsel 
we met with both mr tellep and mr simmons she said mr 
simmons provided us a written commitment that if elected he would 
recommend to his slate the creation of a shareholder advisory 
committee 
simmons chief lieutenant j landis martin said in a telephone 
interview that many large institutional shareholders like calpers 
have favorably received simmons message 
we feel a real tidal wave coming martin said were just 
getting a really favorable response from the large shareholders 
simmons through his nl industries chemical company began 
buying lockheed stock about 18 months ago he now holds about 19 
percent of the common shares outstanding he spent about 530 
million buying that stake and has shown 100 million in paper 
losses on his investment as lockheeds stock price fell 
the biggest reason for the plunging stock price was poor 
earnings lockheeds profits fell from 624 million on sales of 
104 billion in 1988 to 2 million on sales of 99 billion last 
year chiefly because the company had to take nearly 500 million 
in special charges after underestimating the costs of developing 
several programs for the military including a submarinehunting 
plane

japanese government leaders struggled tuesday to 
build a consensus before next weeks deadline for responding to 
us demands that japan foster trade by altering its economy 
at prime minister toshiki kaifus request the government has 
created a series of proposals aimed at meeting the us requests in 
recent trade talks 
the socalled structural impediments initiative talks are aimed 
at eliminating factors in each countrys economy that hinder 
reductions in their 49 billion trade imbalance 
chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto met party leaders in a 
series of meetings tuesday to ask for their support for the 
government proposals 
but former foreign minister shintaro abe an influential 
politician who is widely seen as a prime candidate to succeed 
kaifu reportedly warned sakamoto not to accept every us request 
japanus relations are very important and are at the core of 
japans diplomacy but we cannot say yes to every request kyodo 
news service quoted abe as saying if we accept everything it 
us demands will go on endlessly 
japan is expected to convey its decisions to the united states 
at the fourth round of the bilateral talks set for next monday and 
tuesday in washington 
the asahi shimbun a leading japanese newspaper recently 
printed a list of more than 200 suggestions made by the united 
states in the talks 
washington wants to eliminate barriers in japans economic and 
business structure that it contends prevent foreign companies from 
entering the japanese market 
for example washington says japans complex distribution system 
makes it difficult for foreign businesses to sell their products on 
the japanese market it also has pressured japan to boost its 
public works spending and tighten enforcement of its antimonopoly 
law to assure fair competition for foreign businesses 
toshio yamaguchi chairman of the governing liberal democratic 
partys panel handling issues related to the trade talks told the 
associated press that kaifu must tackle those three issues 
without hesitating to accept pain 
he needs to go as far as considering the possibility of 
scrapping the laws related to those issues he said or we may 
not be able to come up with decisions acceptable to the united 
states 
but other liberal democratic leaders were less conciliatory 
said lawmaker takujiro hamada who chaired the meeting 
the parliamentarians said that resistance to the reforms was 
very strong in their constituencies and that it would take a long 
time to carry out the reforms suggested by the united states in the 
trade talks hamada said 
separately the leading financial newspaper nihon keizai shimbun 
released results of a public opinion survey in which 474 percent 
of the 6186 respondents said they viewed the us trade complaints 
as basically reasonable 
some 9 percent said they completely agree with the demands and 
384 percent replied that the us claims basically were right but 
there were a few unreasonable points the newspaper said 
it said 329 percent said many of the us requests were 
unreasonable and 66 called them completely unreasonable 
the newspaper said 859 percent of the respondents said japan 
should do its best to meet the us requests because to do so 
will benefit japan or because the usjapan relationship is 
important no margin of error was provided for the survey 
conducted march 1619 
meanwhile government officials said tuesday they had agreed to 
start considering a us toy companys bid to open a discount store 
in japan 
toys r us has announced plans to open a 53800 squarefoot 
discount store in niigata 160 miles northwest of tokyo despite 
strong opposition by local shopkeepers 
japans largescale retail stores law one item targeted by 
us trade officials requires that small retailers be consulted 
before any large stores are opened in their areas 
while some japanese retailers have had to wait up to 10 years 
for permission to set up large new stores consideration is under 
way to shorten the maximum waiting period required under the law to 
two years said an official of the ministry of international 
trade and industry who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in addition to making entry to japans market difficult for 
foreign retailers the law works against larger japanese stores 
that would be more likely to carry foreign products us officials 
say

atampt on tuesday announced an office computer 
system the company says offers unique features to allow employees 
to work together on group projects more effectively 
american telephone amp telegraph cos new rhapsody system links 
personal computers in a network an increasingly popular computer 
configuration for offices because it allows workers to share 
information 
but atampt said its system goes beyond existing networked systems 
because it can be programmed to gather information from computer 
files ask other computers for data send tasks to employees 
schedule meetings distribute reports for review and continuously 
track the status of projects 
among other enhancements is the ability to automatically perform 
routine functions such as creating expense vouchers or processing 
insurance claims 
esther dyson who edits the computer industry newsletter release 
10 said the rhapsody system is significant because it pulls 
together all the elements of a networked system the computers 
themselves the server the networking gear the software to run 
it and applications software such as wordprocessing programs 
such a package is not available from computer giants such as 
international business machines corp or digital equipment corp 
although they provide most of the pieces she said 
ms dyson said atampts expertise in communications gives it 
unique credibility in linking computers locally or worldwide 
the atampt system like many others has an onscreen graphics 
display that uses pictures such as file cabinets notepads and fax 
machines to execute commands rather than typedin written commands 
although atampt is selling both the computers and the software to 
operate the system it also will sell the software alone to 
companies that already have desktop computers 
the system is based on the clientserver model of computing 
in which a server essentially a highpowered computer acts as 
the central data repository for personal computers linked on the 
network which are called the clients 
the rhapsody system is based on a number of software systems 
developed by other companies including hewlettpackard cos 
newwave software and the windows graphicaluserinterface software 
made by microsoft corp 
the system also will run such popular applications software as 
lotus development corps 123 spreadsheet program and microsofts 
word for windows wordprocessing program 
the first rhapsody system will be based on desktop computers 
made by international business machines corp or compatible models 
sold by atampt and others that use the msdos operating system later 
versions will be compatible with computers based on atampts unix 
operating system 
the computer server sold with the system is made by both atampt 
and intel corp 
atampt said rhapsody is targeted at medium to large companies a 
complete system for a 20person office including the desktop 
computers will cost about 170000 the software alone for 
companies that already have desktop computers and a server will 
cost about 2000 atampt said

national association of realtors president 
norman d flynn says housing affordability tops the trade groups 
list of key issues for the 1990s but for now a buyers 
paradise exists in some regions of the country 
flynn said the association is pushing for the government to take 
a more active role in helping prospective buyers particularly 
qualifying firsttimers by making it easier for them save for a 
downpayment and providing more affordable loans 
many firsttime buyers cant reach the first rung and thats 
hurting everyone on the higher rungs too flynn said in an 
interview tuesday 
he suggested that the federal government allow certain 
homebuyers and even their relatives to tap into their individual 
retirement accounts and 401k savings plans without penalty of 
withdrawal he also suggested the government lower downpayment 
requirements on financing insured by the federal housing 
administration and establish secondary markets for seller 
financing which could lower the cost of such borrowing 
states could provide more lowinterest loan programs through 
mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates flynn added 
even changes at the local government level could help he said 
many communities have nogrowth or slowgrowth housing 
policies which have been responsible for artificially driving up 
many home prices by severly limiting the housing stock flynn said 
he said that has had a particularly adverse impact on socalled 
moveup buyers 
flynn said he believes fellow real estate agents should lobby 
for reasonable growth initiatives within towns and cities as well 
as speedier bureaucratic processes to help hold down developers 
costs 
for those who can afford it however there are attractive 
bargains in certain housing markets these days according to flynn 
he pointed to the northeast where a previous sharp runup in 
housing prices has subsided 
the buyer needs to be reminded that this is a buyers 
paradise he said theres tremendous opportunity weve got to 
get the buyier to look at the market 
flynn predicted that interest rates would drop by at least half 
a percentage point in the next several weeks reflecting the 
continued sluggishness in the economy and that should spur buyer 
interest 
mortgage rates are now averaging 103 percent on conventional 
30year loans after falling below 10 percent earlier in the year 
the rise in rates had curbed housing demand causing nationwide 
sales of existing homes to drop an average 23 percent in february 
to the lowest level in seven months according to an associaton 
report released monday 
flynn said there should be sufficient capital to meet borrowing 
demands despite projections by some banks and federal regulators 
that problem real estate loans are likely to increase

burst of buying lifted the market out of its doldrums 
analysts said their was no particular economic reason for the

the market gradually began to show some life after sinking to 
the days lows just after midday the dow jones average dipped 
below the 2700mark to 2699 at around 1230 est 
analysts attributed the late gains mainly to normal window 
dressing that accompanies the end of a quarter 
funds are going into blue chips that investors regard as their 
favorites said charles jensen chief technical analyst for the 
new york investment firm mki securities corp 
drug stocks airlines and oil stocks were among the days better 
performers 
volume nevertheless was slim as many institutional players 
remained on the sidelines with what analysts called endofthe 
quarter blues in anticipation of possible disappointing 
firstquarter corporate profits 
corporate profits which have been in a recession since the 
second quarter of last year continued to decline in the fourth

united technologies corp and west 
germanys daimlerbenz ag announced preliminary agreement tuesday 
to operate their jet engine divisions as a single company for 
certain ventures a move analysts said makes sense given looming 
defense cuts 
under the memorandum of understanding daimlerbenz will invest 
in pratt amp whitney united technologies jet engine division and 
united technologies will invest in daimlers motorenund turbinen 
union or mtu daimlers aerospace and defense division 
this agreement is setting in stone the relationship that has 
existed for some time between united technologies and 
daimlerbenz said david franus an analyst with the market 
research firm forecast international this is a synergistic 
agreement which will open up new markets for both of these huge 
companies 
franus said the companies will be able to work together on 
projects by pooling their resources allowing them to pare research 
and development expenses 
the two divisions already are partners with three other jet 
engine makers in international aero engines a consortium that 
produces the v2500 commercial jet engine the other partners are 
rollsroyce plc japanese aero engines corp and fiat aviazione 
this agreement comes at a time when the aero industry is 
undergoing some serious rethinking franus said with defense 
cuts united technologies will undoubtedly see sales decrease and 
it needs to approach other avenues in the commercial sector 
during the past several years pratt amp whitney and the daimler 
unit also have expanded cooperation in the development and 
manufacturing of commercial jet engines including the pratt amp 
whitney jt8d200 pw2000 and pw300 models 
we have concluded that a formal collaboration between our 
companies is an excellent strategic step to broaden and expand our 
historically close relationship robert f daniell united 
technologies chairman and chief executive office said in a 
statement 
it will allow both pratt amp whitney and mtu to expand their 
markets and complement each others unique strengths in technology 
and manufacturing he said 
daniell and edzard reuter daimlerbenz chairman and chief 
executive officer said the agreement comes after more than two 
years of discussion among top management of both companies full 
details have not been settled they said 
under the agreement mtu will be pratt amp whitneys principal 
partner for europe and the preferred partner worldwide 
once new commercial engine programs of interest to both 
companies are identified joint teams will coordinate research 
development manufacturing and marketing the companies said 
the joint teams will work to minimize duplication in product 
development and maximize efficiency by concentrating production of 
certain components for common products at one company or the 
other the companies said in a joint statement 
operations in these programs will be conducted as if we 
were one organization the companies said although pratt amp 
whitney and mtu will retain their own management 
united technologies had sales of 195 billion last year and 
employs 201000 workers its products include carrier heating and 
air conditioning systems otis elevators and escalators sikorsky 
helicopters hamilton standard aerospace systems norden defense 
systems and ut automotive components and systems 
daimlerbenz is divided into four corporate units 
mercedesbenz the automaker aeg an electrical equipment maker

investor harold simmons won a powerful ally 
tuesday in his contest to unseat the board of lockheed corp 
californias 56 billion public employees retirement system 
which owns 500000 lockheed shares 
the pension fund known as calpers said it would back simmons 
ratherthan lockheed chairman daniel tellep after simmons agreed to 
urge his slate of directors to set up a shareholders committee to 
advise the board calpers advocates such panels as a way to exert 
more control over companies in which it invests 
we met with both mr tellep and mr simmons said kayla 
gillan calpers assistant general counsel mr simmons provided 
us a written commitment that if elected he would recommend to his 
slate the creation of a shareholder advisory committee 
in waging a proxy election campaign to get his slate elected to 
the lockheed board simmons has tried to put tellep on the 
defensive with proposals to give lockheed shareholders more input 
he says that if his faction is put in charge he could manage the 
company so as to increase the price of lockheeds stock which has 
plunged nearly 20 per share in recent months 
lockheed closed up 112 at 37 a share tuesday on the new york 
stock exchange 
tellep who contends simmons has no idea how to run a big 
defense company countered on tuesday with his own attempt to woo 
the big institutional shareholders who hold 60 percent of 
lockheeds stock 
he promised them a seat on the board after lockheeds annual 
meeting thursday when the company will announce whether tellep and 
the other directors have been ousted in simmons proxy battle 
we will work with our institutional shareholders to develop a 
list of potential directors from within or outside their ranks who 
could provide additional perspective to our directors tellep 
said in a statement 
we believe that selection of at least one director from that 
list could provide important input to the future of the company 
calpers holds less than 1 percent of lockheeds stock although 
its influence is greater than the stake might suggest 
for example calpers has persuaded occidental petroleum corp to 
allow calpers officials access to occidental directors twice a 
year occidental agreed to the meetings as a compromise after 
calpers demanded a shareholders advisory committee similar to the 
one promised by simmons 
simmons chief lieutenant j landis martin said in a telephone 
interview that calpers is one of many institutional shareholders 
leaning toward simmons 
we feel a real tidal wave coming martin said were 
feeling very good about our position and im virtually sure there 
will be a clean sweep on the shareholders rights issues 
those issues to be voted on thursday include confidential 
shareholder voting opting out of the tough antitakeover laws in 
delaware where lockheed is incorporated and eliminating a poison 
pill provision that makes it prohibitively expensive for anyone 
to buy more than 20 percent of lockheeds stock without the 
companys approval 
simmons through his nl industries chemical company began 
buying lockheed stock about 18 months ago he now holds about 19 
percent of the common shares outstanding he spent about 530 
million buying that stake and has shown 100 million in paper 
losses on his investment as lockheeds stock price fell 
a big reason for the plunging stock price was poor earnings 
lockheeds profits fell from 624 million on sales of 104 billion 
in 1988 to 2 million on sales of 99 billion last year chiefly 
because the company took nearly 500 million in charges after 
underestimating the costs of developing new programs including a 
submarinehunting plane 
simmons says the company has overdiversified and probably should 
sell large chunks of its operations that lie outside its core 
space missiles and aeronautical businesses

the law firm of gov george deukmejians top 
fundraiser will pay up to 143 million to settle classaction 
lawsuits filed by investors who bought nowworthless junk bonds 
from lincoln savings amp loan association 
the fundraiser karl samuelian said monday that his firm 
parker milliken clark ohara amp samuelian agreed to pay at least 
43 million if plaintiffs do not recover an additional 10 
million from other defendants the firm will make up the 
difference samuelian said in a statement 
the law firms insurance will cover the 143 million in 
guarantees that amount is the equivalent of 7 cents on the dollar 
for the investors who lost money on the bonds 
in return samuelians firm will be dropped as a defendant in 
the suits 
seventeen lawsuits naming more than 20 defendants have been 
filed in federal and state courts by attorneys representing 
bondholders who lost money to phoenix arizbased american 
continental corp lincolns parent company 
parker milliken was one of several legal and accounting firms 
hired by american continental to persuade regulators to permit the 
sale of american continental highyield or junk bonds at lincoln 
branches 
lawyers from the firm including samuelian argued the case 
before regulators who eventually permitted the sales the lawsuits 
accuse parker milliken of wrongly using its political influence 
with the regulators several of whom had worked for the firm in the 
past 
more than 23000 investors many of them elderly people on fixed 
incomes lost 200 million on junk bonds they bought at lincoln 
branches many have said they were tricked into buying the bonds 
under the pretense they were insured like regular savings accounts 
a civil suit filed by the state earlier this month accuses 
american continental owner charles h keating of casting a web of 
fraud and lies to snare investors into buying the bonds 
keating has denied any wrongdoing and suggests he is the victim 
of a campaign of harassment by government officials who are unable 
to comprehend his sophisticated financial tactics 
samuelian was the private attorney for keating whose 
corporation has filed for bankruptcy protection 
though samuelian has never held a government post he has been 
the chief fundraiser for deukmejian treasurer of his campaigns 
and a noted political confidante of the republican governor 
the tentative settlement is subject to court approval 
we have reached an agreement in principle and the details will 
be worked out in a final settlement agreement said seth aronson 
an attorney representing the los angelesbased firm 
samuelian declined to elaborate on reasons for reaching the 
settlement

a 5 million payment by allied stores corp 
into a taxexempt trust fund for a former allied executive is part 
of the corporations bankruptcy estate for distribution to 
creditors a judge ruled tuesday 
the ruling was made by us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr 
who is overseeing the chapter 11 reorganization of allied and its 
sister retailer federated department stores inc 
aug upheld allieds argument that the trust agreement mandates 
that in the event of a bankruptcy filing the fund would become 
part of allieds bankruptcy estate for payment to creditors under 
court supervision 
aug rejected arguments by a lawyer for the executive thomas m 
macioce that macioce was entitled to the 5 million as part of the 
retirement terms he obtained when he resigned as allieds hairman 
and chief executive officer in january 1987 after 27 years with the 
company 
macioce now a partner in the new york city law firm shea amp 
gould didnt attend the cincinnati hearing and could not be 
reached at his office for a response 
macioce was the only one of nine current or former federated and 
allied executives with such trusts who objected to their inclusion 
among funds for payment to creditors said allied lawyer greg 
gordon 
aug also gave allied and federated permission to complete 91 
million worth of ongoing store construction projects in florida 
oregon tennessee and washington state 
the projects include construction of two new stores a 30 
million bloomingdales in palm beach gardens fla and an 113 
million bon marche in eugene ore the other projects are a 215 
million renovation of the bon marche flagship store in downtown 
seattle an 115 million reworking of a bon marche store in 
tukwila wash and a 166 million renovation of goldsmiths 
flagship store in memphis tenn 
federated and allied must obtain augs permission for all 
corporate spending since their jan 15 chapter 11 filings 
federated and allied are units of torontobased campeau corp 
aug also allowed lawyers for federated and allied and their 
suppliers to work out terms that would allow the two retailers to 
return 25 million worth of christmas season merchandise for credit 
returns of such merchandise are routine in retailing but were 
complicated when some suppliers refused the returns because of 
questions about the effect of the chapter 11 filings company 
spokeswoman catharine wright said

currencies except the british pound tuesday extending a rally that 
reflected fears of growing political and economic instability 
abroad 
gold prices rebounded slightly after a tumultuous plunge monday 
that strategists traced to the dollars strength and abnormally 
large gold sales from the middle east by 4 pm est bullion 
fetched 36885 a troy ounce at republic national bank in new york

currency dealers attributed the dollars rise largely to 
questions over japans ability to manage its unwieldy financial 
markets and other economic problems they also said the soviet 
unions resolve to suppress lithuanian independence was unsettling 
european markets and raising demand for dollars 
im basically a dollar bull just based on a fundamental 
assessment of the world situation said zlatko glamuzina chief 
trader at the banco di sicilias new york branch as a safe 
haven i dont think anybody can beat the united states right now 
john mccarthy chief dealer at the new york branch of amsterdam 
rotterdam bank also said he foresaw continued appetite for 
dollars with the situation in lithuania i think the dollar has 
little downside potential 
some said unfounded rumors that soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev might resign contributed to the dollars strength such 
rumors frequently have surfaced in the climate of uncertainty 
surrounding changes in eastern europe 
i didnt see it on any news screens but i heard it from 
brokers said andrew hodge vice president of corporate treasury 
services at the new york office of bank brussels lambert a large 
belgian commercial bank it was clearly associated with the

time trading concluded in new york the dollar fetched 15774 yen 
up from 15670 yen late monday the dollar was at the highest level

market shortage of the british currency it cost 16255 to buy 
sterling late tuesday more expensive than 16135 late monday in 
new york the pound fetched 16260 more valuable than the 16185

the shaken gold market appeared to stabilize somewhat from its 
severe beating monday when bullion prices plunged as much as 30 
an ounce and nearly erased a rally that began six months ago some

years

xerox corp on tuesday introduced a new 
copier that can phone home for help when it senses a problem 
developing 
the xerox 5065 a midvolume copier that produces 62 copies a 
minute is the first xerox copier to offer a builtin remote 
interactive communications system the company said 
xeroxs highvolume 1090 copier offers the ric system as an 
optional addon feature said xerox spokesman daniel c minchen 
the ric system continuously checks the copiers performance 
against set standards and alerts a central computer when it notices 
a potential problem minchen said 
information about the problem is transmitted via telephone to 
the central computer where an artificial intelligence system 
analyzes the data and decides whether a service call is needed 
surveys show that customers highest priority is avoiding copier 
breakdowns and emergency maintenance calls the company said 
the ric system should notice most problems before the people 
using the machine do minchen said eliminating the need for 
customers to call xerox for service 
with every service call theres a possibility for 
dissatisfaction he said this eliminates all that by notifying 
the company before a potential problem becomes a real problem 
well call the customer first 
minchen said the ric system will not notice problems such as 
loose doors or spots on the copy but it will detect document 
misfeeds depletion of the copiers developer or toner repeated 
paper jams and other mechanical or electrical failures he said 
the artificial intelligence system decides what the problem 
might be and sends a service worker out with the right parts 
minchen said 
the system also keeps track of how many copies are made which 
minchen said will be a more efficent way of billing than requiring 
customers to keep track of how much they use a machine 
the 5065 copier will sell for 30650 xerox said

the trustee for the bankrupt delaware amp 
hudson railway was given less than two weeks to find a buyer for 
the freight carrier or face the liquidation of the nations oldest 
continually operated railroad 
us bankruptcy judge helen balick on tuesday granted a request 
from trustee francis dicello for an extension to continue operating 
damph while a buyer is sought the judge set an april 11 date to 
determine whether the rail line will be sold or if liquidation 
should begin 
dicello said the deadline for offers is april 6 
if there clearly are no potentially doable offers on the 
table then we will liquidate he said 
shippers who use the damph lines would be notified that they must 
find an alternative by midnight april 16 which has been set as the 
shutdown date 
if there is a potential buyer for all or part of the rail line 
dicello said he would ask the court for another extension until the 
sale is completed 
damph which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in june 
1988 is about 100 million in debt dicello said liquidation could 
result in an estimated 70 million to 80 million 
but i dont want to do that he said i dont see a lot of 
winners with liquidation 
with the extension the rail line will continue to operate with 
subsidies from shippers the states of new york and pennsylvania 
and with cash collateral that is being held for its secured 
creditors 
the extension was supported by attorneys representing the 
shippers the states and a majority of the creditors 
john broadley attorney for guilford transportation inc damphs 
sole shareholder opposed the extension and asked the court for 
immediate liquidation 
there is no interest by anyone of acquiring damph the trustee 
has no offer broadley said 
canadian pacific ltd submitted a bid of 35 million for damph but 
withdrew the offer in midfebruary after talks broke down with 
consolidated rail corp over track rights between harrisburg pa 
and hagerstown md the tracks would give the carrier access to key 
southern routes 
broadley said there was no assurance that congress would pass 
legislation forcing conrail to negotiate track rights with canadian 
pacific 
dicello said canadian pacific indicated monday that it would 
submit a significantly lower bid for damph without the track rights 
dicello indicated in court he would not consider an extremely low 
damph carries freight from montreal to washington dc and from 
albany to buffalo in new york more than 400 workers would lose 
their jobs if no buyer is found

attempt was paid 115 million last year double his 1988 
compensation 
the company also disclosed that john c pope uals chief 
financial officer took advantage of last years steep climb in 
uals stock price to exercise about 59 million in stock options 
or stock appreciation rights

for six hours by a judge about his 65 days as a vice president of 
banco ambrosiano the bank that touched off italys largest banking 
scandal when it failed in 1982 
at the end of tuesdays questioning de benedetti told reporters 
he was serene and satisfied because he was able to tell the 
magistrate the total honesty of my behavior 
de benedetti the head of a financial empire that includes the 
olivetti computer group was questioned by raffaele invrea chief 
judge of the milan court of appeals after being notified that he 
was suspected of possible involvement in fraudulent bankruptcy 
invrea declined to give any details of the questioning and said 
only that a judge speaks by taking measures 
no action was taken against de benedetti who had been 
investigated by a lower court in the same case 
lower court judges antonio pizzi and renato brichetti after a 
long investigation into the banco ambrosiano failure decided last 
april not to pursue the case in regard to de benedetti whose 
summoning for questioning this week came as a surprise 
the scope of the lower court investigation centered on whether 
de benedetti made an illegal profit from his investment in the bank 
about 52 billion lire 40 million on a 2 percent stake in 
ambrosiano 
de benedetti has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or that he 
profited from his investment 
the financiers vice presidency in italys largest private bank 
in which the vatican bank was a major shareholder lasted 65 days 
through jan 22 1982 
de benedetti sold the stake once he resigned his post he cited 
disagreements with bank chairman roberto calvi for his decision to 
quit 
calvi nicknamed gods banker because of his close ties with 
the vatican was found hanging from a london bridge in june 1982 
ambrosiano collapsed two months later following the failure to 
win repayment of 13 billion in loans made by the italian bank to 
dummy latin american companies backed by the institute for 
religious works which is commonly called the vatican bank 
de benedetti said the questioning was long but added that it was 
difficult to detail his 65 days in a few hours 
a trial of 25 banco ambrosiano board members and officials 
charged following the bank collapse is scheduled to begin in milan 
on may 29 
court sources indicated that appeal judges would decide de

a top nordstrom inc executive called a seattle 
newspapers coverage of the retailers labor problems horrible 
but he said the companys decision to cut advertising in the paper 
wasnt meant as retaliation 
cochairman jim nordstrom said the company was only taking a 
closer look at the effectiveness of its advertising 
nordstrom spokeswoman megan mckenzie said the company told the 
seattle times and seattle postintelligencer on friday that it was 
cutting back on its ads the papers maintain separate editorial and 
news staffs but the times handles advertising and printing for 
both under a joint operating agreement 
cindy demme vice president for sales promotion said nordstrom 
has been trying different mixes of advertising media in other 
markets and wanted to try the same thing in seattle 
ads were cut from six last thursday in the times including 
three fullpage displays and three smaller ones to one fullpage 
ad planned for this thursday 
known for its upscale clothing and attentive customer service 
nordstrom has come under increasing scrutiny for stormy labor 
relations and declining profits and stock prices 
earlier this year it was hit by a triple whammy state findings 
that nordstrom failed to pay some employees for work done outside 
their scheduled hours unfair labor practice complaints by the 
national labor relations board and a 34 percent profit slump for 
the year ending jan 31 
the wall street journal also ran a frontpage article by 
reporter susan c faludi detailing complaints of past and present 
nordstrom workers 
if we do cut our advertising anywhere its because were not 
getting a good value for our dollars jim nordstrom was quoted as 
saying in tuesdays times and frankly with the rising costs of 
your two papers we need to do some reevaluating 
nordstrom said there was no link between the ad cuts and 
coverage in the papers but added referring to the times 
we think your coverage is horrible the worst in the nation 
worse than the wall street journal because that girl didnt know 
us she just regurgitated what the union said 
michael fancher times executive editor said advertising cuts 
wouldnt alter the newspapers coverage 
i think its important for readers to understand that when 
advertisers purchase an ad they are buying exposure to our 
readers nothing more and nothing less he said 
times ad director marji ruiz said nordstrom is one of the 
afternoon papers top 10 advertisers 
our rate increases over the last few years have been less than 
the national average said jack a williams times sales and 
marketing vice president 
meanwhile tuesday the nlrb dismissed a petition seeking to 
decertify united food and commercial workers local 367 as the 
bargaining agent for nordstrom clerks at the tacoma store 
a decertification petition also was filed tuesday against ufcw 
local 1001 in the seattle area but larry mccarger assistant to 
the nlrbs regional director said that attempt might fare no 
better 
mccarger said the board has a long history of refusing to 
conduct decertification elections while unresolved nlrb complaints 
are pending 
the two locals represent about 1800 employees at six nordstrom 
outlets the only unionized stores in the chain nordstrom has 60 
stores and 30000 employees in washington oregon alaska utah 
virginia and california 
one organizer of the decertification campaign is kathleen 
sargent a clerk in the downtown seattle store and goddaughter of 
anne nordstrom sister of cochairman bruce nordstrom 
the biggest concern that weve had is the union has distorted 
the image of what its like to work for nordstrom sargent told 
the postintelligencer they make it sound like its a slave 
house and its not its a very positive and productive 
environment 
the nlrb has accused nordstrom of attempting to bypass the union 
and negotiate directly with employees refusing to provide the 
union with information for collective bargaining and changing 
vacation benefits without negotiating with the union

coloradoute electric association unable 
to control expenses and raise rates to its liking has decided to 
file for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
tuesdays decision came nearly one year after coloradoute 
which serves about 600000 colorado residents defaulted on its 
loans the utility is 12 billion in debt and owes the federal 
government at least 723 million 
board chairman joe deganahl ii blamed the move on the colorado 
public utilities commission which decided march 8 to grant 
coloradoute an 8 percent rate hike instead of the 237 percent 
increase the utility sought 
we tried very hard to resolve this in a manner to solve the 
needs of all the parties deganahl told reporters after the vote 
that was unfortunately not to be because of the actions of 
others clearly the straw was the commissions decision 
his comments were denounced by the puc and state office of 
consumer counsel who said coloradoute brought its problems upon 
itself 
it has taken many years for coloradoute to get in the 
financial position it finds itself said puc spokeswoman barbara 
fernandez it is unfair to blame us for what has occurred 
the director of the consumer counsel office called for 
appointment of an independent receiver to direct the utilitys 
reorganization given what coloradoutes management has done the 
court should put the company in the hands of others 
the board of directors met for two days behind closed doors and 
emerged tuesday afternoon to vote 120 in public to authorize 
company president ray keith to file for chapter 11 reorganization 
at his discretion 
a chapter 11 reorganization filing is imminent unless

the bankruptcy trustee for the delaware amp 
hudson railway is seeking new bids for all or part of the failing 
freight line the nations oldest continually operated railroad a 
spokesman for the federal railroad administration said 
the trustee francis p dicello met monday in a closed session 
with representatives of about 16 carriers with an interest in damph 
and invited them to make offers said mark lindsey the fras 
general counsel 
the talks took place under a special rule that allows 
competitors to discuss business without violating antitrust laws 
lindsey said 
dicello also is planning to return to bankruptcy court in 
wilmington del on tuesday to seek a months extension of the 
order allowing him to run the damph while he seeks a buyer lindsey 
said that order is set to expire tuesday 
dicello who has been seeking a buyer for damph since september 
was not in his office monday and did not return a phone call 
david murray a spokesman for the new york department of 
transportation said dicello would entertain bids for the whole damph 
system until april 6 
the meeting monday was called after consolidated rail corp 
broke off negotiations last week with canadian pacific ltd over 
trackage rights 
canadian pacific had bid 35 million for damph but withdrew the 
offer in midfebruary when conrail refused to negotiate use of 
tracks between harrisburg pa and hagerstown md which would 
give the carrier access to key southern routes 
weve been at this with them for three months now and when you 
get the chairmen of the two companies agreeing that theyre going 
to disagree theres no higher authority in either company so 
that puts an end to it cp rail spokesman john cox said monday 
conrail has maintained that providing the rights would reduce 
its annual revenues substantially and could lead to the loss of 600 
to 900 jobs 
damph carries freight from montreal to washington dc and from 
albany to buffalo in new york the railway filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in june 1988 more than 400 workers would 
lose their jobs if no buyer is found 
sen alfonse damato rny said friday he would ask senate 
leaders to speed up consideration of a bill he introduced to force 
conrail to relinquish its track rights 
it seems clear that conrail never wanted to make a deal that 
would help revive and strengthen the damph damato said in a 
statement
