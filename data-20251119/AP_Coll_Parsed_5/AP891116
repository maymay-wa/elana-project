negotiators for the nicaraguan government and 
the contra rebels met for four hours thursday night and were unable 
to narrow their differences on terms for restoring a cease fire 
spokesmen for both sides said the principal sticking point was 
the refusal by the contras to agree to a sandinista demand for the 
withdrawal of rebel forces inside nicaragua to base camps in 
honduras 
the sandinistas are linking their consent to a cease fire to a 
rebel withdrawal while the contras are insisting on maintaining 
their present positions once a truce goes into effect 
one positive sign after the talks recessed was the absence of 
kind of strident criticism of each others position that 
characterized their public comments 24 hours earlier 
the talks began on nov 9 and will resume friday morning 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo an official witness to the 
discussions left the talks wednesday night to keep an appointment 
elsewhere he said he rejoined the negotiations thursday night on 
orders from the holy see after his departure wednesday the 
atmosphere for the discusssions deteriorated markedly 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros told reporters he had noted a 
hardening of the governments position on the ceasefire 
the chief rebel negotiator col enrique bermudez said the 
sandinistas showed no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire as a 
first step in a confidence building process 
his sandinista counterpart viceforeign minister victor hugo 
tinoco said that for a real and effective ceasefire to take 
place the contras should go back to their camps in honduras 
there are an estimated 5000 rebels inside nicaraguan territory 
earlier bermudez said that once a ceasefire was agreed to 
details of the duties and makeup of a verification commission to 
monitor compliance could be worked out 
the talks are being mediated by officials from the united 
nations and the organization of american states one of whom said 
after the 10 pm recess that the negotiations were inching 
along 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega suspended the ceasefire 17 
days ago citing what he said were repeated terrorist activities by 
the contra forces 
reviving the truce is considered an important goal because 
national elections are set for nicaragua on feb 25 
the contra delegation stunned the sandinistas wednesday night 
when bermudez called for a weeklong recess in the talks just when 
government negotiators said an agreement appeared to be within 
reach 
tinoco told a news conference thursday that the rebel action 
shows clearly the contras have no interest in peace no interest 
in a ceasefire no interest in demobilization 
but matamoros denied that significant progress had been made 
wednesday asserting that statements to the contrary were not 
accurate and that the sandinista negotiators showed a lack of 
flexibility in the discussions 
the contras proposed on wednesday that the talks be reconvened 
in a week possibly in guatemala but bermudez seemed to back away 
from that stand thursday by calling for a resumption of the talks 
in early evening

one day after hearing solidarity leader lech 
walesa appeal for economic aid the house on thursday approved a 
threeyear aid plan authorizing 8465 million for poland and 915 
million for hungary 
the compromise measure drawn up by housesenate negotiators 
was sent to the senate where it hit a snag when republicans 
complained that safeguards they added to prevent misuse of the

military assistance to nicaragua or cuba

mitchell dmaine stopped consideration of the measure and sent it 
to a formal conference with negotiators from both chambers

program opposed by senate republicans to help poland spur its 
foreign trade the measure was not included in the 738 million aid 
package passed by the senate earlier this week 
the house voted 37247 to strip from the bill unrelated tax 
provisions added by sen john danforth rmo 
in its final version the bill authorizes 200 million to help 
poland shore up the value of its currency wich has been battered by 
inflation 
a private enterprise fund of 240 million also was authorized to 
help poland discard its centralized communist economic system and 
move to a freemarket economy

the senate late thursday approved a 22month 
extension of the us civil rights commission that would head off 
the panels automatic demise at the end of this month 
the measure now goes back to the house which had passed a 
sixmonth extension a day earlier and was ready to accept the 
longerterm bill said a spokesman for sen paul simon dill who 
worked out the compromise 
the spokesman david carle said the 22month extension was a 
middle ground between democrats who wanted only a shortterm 
measure while they waited to see whom president bush appoints to 
the panel in the coming weeks and the white houses desire for a 
sixyear bill 
the commission won praise in the 1960s for holding hearings 
across the south and recommending bold civil rights legislation 
but during the reagan administration its effectiveness has eroded 
and the panel has been consumed by internal bickering congress has 
slashed funding for the commission

christmas music fills the air and ornaments 
decorate the halls of north dakotas largest mall but shoppers are 
talking more about a court challenge to the nations strictest 
sunday closing laws 
the greater north dakota association the states chamber of 
commerce announced this week it will go to court to have those 
laws declared unconstitutional 
the socalled blue laws rooted in religious tradition have 
been on the books since north dakota became a state 100 years go 
in 1889 sunday sales were restricted to meats and fish if sold 
before 10 am and to grocery items such as medicine milk and 
cigars 
the laws have been relaxed over the years including a provision 
exempting tourist attractions in 1985 the state allowed grocery 
stores to open under the operation of a manager and no more than 
six workers 
bismarck lawyer orell schmitz said its time for another change 
the constitution is not a document thats cast in stone 
it changes and has to change to reflect the times as they 
change schmitz said tuesday 
mark sinner owner of one of the 114 stores and restaurants in 
the west acres mall north dakotas largest said he was encouraged 
by the associations announcement 
ive always thought that its very discriminatory for them to 
tell me that i cant open on sunday but other stores can he 
said 
theres no doubt wed fill the mall on sunday added sinner 
the nephew of gov george sinner 
some mall employees would rather have sunday off than make more 
money 
im a student and i like to have my sundays off to study and 
do research said linda perry a parttime employee she 
acknowledged however that she shops on sundays in supermarkets 
and convenience stores that remain open 
eight states have some form of sunday sales laws according to 
the national retail merchants association but most of the major 
ones have been struck down by the courts 
alabama south dakota oklahoma and west virginia restrict 
liquor sales on sundays and louisiana restricts the sale of cars 
in maine small specialty stores are exempt from sunday closing 
laws and all stores are allowed to open on sundays between 
thanksgiving and christmas in missouri counties have the option 
of restricting sunday sales 
patty smith a mother of two who traveled the 25 miles to fargo 
from amenia to shop on tuesday said that sunday should be a day 
for families 
i know they say it will generate more business for the stores 
and revenue for the state but that has to be weighed against the 
effects on families smith said 
others say on religious grounds that sunday should be a day of 
rest for retail workers jeff hickman a restaurant manager and 
president of the west acres merchants association disagrees 
opposing it on religious or moral grounds doesnt make it as 
far as im concerned because you can buy a playboy on sunday but 
you cant buy a bible he said 
dale anderson head of the greater north dakota association 
said the civil lawsuit will ask the court to allow any business to 
open on sunday including liquor stores and bars 
the planned court challenge comes as some cities have begun 
exploiting a loophole that allows stores to open if a community 
festival is declared 
fargo was the first to declare such a festival last month 
granting stores authority to open on sundays between thanksgiving 
and christmas as part of its merry prairie christmas 
celebration but cass county states attorney robert hoy has said 
his office will prosecute businesses that operate on sundays 
vince lindstrom head of the fargomoorhead convention and 
visitors bureau said he hoped the association would seek a court 
order barring authorities from arresting store owners who choose to 
open during the festival 
attorneys have yet to decide when or where the civil lawsuit 
will be filed or to choose a defendant they said tuesday it could 
be filed against an assortment of government bodies 
schmitz said he hoped the court system would handle the lawsuit 
speedily so that we can get it resolved once and for all as to 
what is the status of sunday shopping in north dakota 
because right now schmitz added its in utter chaos

dined at the harvard club today wall street felon ivan boesky is 
said to eat at mister donut and wear a bushy beard and long 
unkempt hair like howard hughes 
boesky the focus of wall streets insider trading scandals is 
on a threeweek furlough from a minimumsecurity federal prison 
camp in lompoc calif 
the owner of a local convenience store said wednesday that a man 
identified as boesky in a frontpage photo in the tabloid new york 
post looked like a homeless person and asked about the sugar 
and salt content of foods during a weekend shopping visit 
the newspaper reported that boesky is staying with friends in 
the stamford area during his release 
the man in the photo wearing unkempt long white hair and a 
beard was dressed in sweat pants and running shoes and carried a 
gym bag and a full change of clothing 
pete tournas 22 owner of for your convenience near downtown 
stamford said the man shopped at the store two or three times over 
the weekend but tournas said he didnt know who he was until 
seeing the newspaper photos 
on one trip the man believed to be boesky bought 45 worth of 
groceries and asked questions about the sugar content of some 
cereals and the salt in other foods tournas said he seemed to 
be on a health kick tournas said 
boesky whose fortune once was estimated at 200 million was 
accompanied by a friend who paid for the groceries he said 
he was a real friendly guy a goodnatured type tournas 
said but he stuck out like a sore thumb 
boesky 52 applied for and was granted the furlough which 
began last thursday prison officials said he is due back at 
lompoc where he is serving a threeyear term around the end of 
the month 
boesky attorney leon silverman on wednesday declined to discuss 
his clients release 
in stamford boesky also supposedly was spotted in a mister 
donut coffee shop across the street from the yeshiva bais 
binyomin a jewish academy for talmudic research 
boesky is known to have developed an interest in judaic studies 
and had endowed a 20 million library at the jewish theological 
seminary in new york city 
he was rumored to have attended night classes at the stamford 
academy over the weekend but the head of the yeshiva denied boesky 
had been there and said he knew of no plans for boesky to attend 
boeskys rabbi in new york city wolfe kelman also declined to 
comment 
boesky who owns a 75acre estate north of new york city is 
eligible for release from prison next april in prison boesky 
reportedly has been working on a cleanup crew lifting weights and 
growing the beard 
three years ago tuesday boesky paid 100 million to the 
securities and exchange commission and agreed to plead guilty to 
one criminal count to settle charges related to a large insider 
trading network 
boesky is cooperating with the government and still is expected 
to testify against former junk bond financier michael milken whose 
trial is set for next year 
legal experts said they expect defense lawyers in the milken 
case to try to use the post photos in which the subject resembles 
the late eccentric billionaire howard hughes to discredit boesky 
but they were expected to have a tough time getting them admitted 
in court 
if he looks weird or erratic its the kind of information a 
good defense attorney will want before a jury said harvey j 
goldschmid a columbia university securities law professor

salt long believed a cause of high blood 
pressure may have the opposite effect on some people on strict 
lowsalt diets a study says but other doctors insist its still 
better to keep your hands off the shaker 
dr brent egan director of the hypertension unit at the medical 
college of wisconsin said his study suggests that strictly 
limiting salt intake could be bad for people with normal blood 
pressure 
he said he believes that the american heart associations 
suggestion of limiting daily salt consumption to 7 grams or about 
1 teaspoons is safe but he said further study is necessary 
before more stringent rules are adopted for the general population 
i think there are some people who are harmed by severe to 
moderate salt restriction at least in the short term said egan 
who based his findings on a diet experiment 
but he cautioned i am not suggesting that the population 
should run out and shake salt on their food 
egan presented his findings wednesday at the heart associations 
annual meeting where his conclusions were immediately questioned 
by other high blood pressure experts 
i would challenge the notion that blood pressures went up 
because they went on lowsalt diets said dr richard grimm of 
the university of minnesota it may just be the normal variation 
in blood pressure we havent seen anything like that in our 
studies 
an estimated 60 million americans have high blood pressure it 
is a major underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes 
large population studies have clearly linked salt with blood 
pressure they show that in general peoples blood pressures rise 
as their salt intake increases 
other factors associated with high blood pressure are obesity 
low potassium consumption and heavy use of alcohol 
public health experts have recommended that all americans watch 
their salt intake even though many people are not sensitive to the 
bad effects of salt some said they feared egans findings might 
make people think widely accepted dietary rules are potentially 
harmful 
it would be a big mistake for us to say that the modest 
reduction of salt that the american heart association recommends 
would be detrimental to anyones health said dr theodore 
kotchen of west virginia university 
in egans study 27 men in their 30s went on alternating 
highand lowsalt diets during the lowsalt phase half of the 
mens blood pressures went down and half rose 
among those whose pressures went up the researchers noticed 
that their levels of lowdensity lipoprotein the socalled bad 
cholesterol also increased as did their levels of insulin and 
uric acid 
egan said that when physicians put patients on lowsalt diets 
they should monitor these people to make sure that the regimens do 
more good than harm 
among other studies presented wednesday 
researchers from several institutions presented findings on 
miniature ultrasound devices that can be passed through the blood 
vessels to give a fantastic voyage view of arteries and the 
heart they said this unique view of the body should help them 
diagnose problems and select and guide the instruments to correct 
them 
doctors from the university of oslo in norway found that people 
with large numbers of bloodclotting cells called platelets are at 
unusually high risk of death from heart disease they followed 
2014 middleaged men for 13 years and found that the 25 percent 
with the highest platelet counts had about double the death rate of 
the other men 
doctors from brigham and womens hospital in boston said an 
experimental test appears to spot the earliest stages of 
cholesterols damage to the blood vessels they found that when 
exposed to the nerve chemical acetylcholine healthy blood vessels 
expand but if they are damaged they contract they hope to use 
the test to spot early signs of trouble in heart transplant 
recipients who are at high risk for artery disease

more and more of this citys power brokers 
seem to be skipping those threemartini lunches in favor of 
lateafternoon english tea closing their deals over a cup of 
darjeeling watercress sandwiches and crumpets slathered with 
strawberry jam 
some of washingtons most exclusive hotels report that corporate 
executives lawyers lobbyists and even congressmen are leading a 
briefcase invasion of the genteel sanctuaries once reserved for 
whitegloved ladies in their search for a quiet place to wheel and 
deal 
whats happening is that teatime is replacing the cocktail 
hour says trial lawyer cary pollak a selftaught expert on 
afternoon tea instead of the power lunch it is getting to be 
more the custom to conduct business over a power tea 
georgetowns swank four seasons hotel part of a canadian chain 
of hostelries is credited with introducing the capital to the 
leisurely delights of afternoon tea about 10 years ago other 
hotels followed trundling out their tea carts every day at 3 
oclock 
most of the hotel restaurant managers interviewed in a random 
telephone survey said their tea customers at first were almost 
exclusively women but they are seeing more and more men enjoying 
this hallowed highcalorie english ritual 
i think its catching on said cynthia gumnick manager of 
the 50seat nest lounge in the willard intercontinental hotel two 
blocks from the white house 
were seeing more and more men she said they dont turn 
up their noses at the door like they used to they come in sit 
down and enjoy themselves sometimes four or five gentlemen will 
order a larger table and spread out their papers before they order 
tea 
prices generally range from about 7 to 12 depending on what 
customers consume with their tea 
the willards typically lavish spread includes a choice of eight 
varieties of hot tea followed by finger sandwiches scones with 
thick devon cream and strawberry jam and an assortment of cakes 
fruit tarts and petite pastries 
will hancock of the four seasons reported that a couple of 
bigname congressmen whom he refused to identify have gotten into 
the habit of slipping into his garden terrace restaurant 
occasionally to confer over afternoon tea 
david carr manager of the lobby lounge at the park hyatt hotel 
said a growing number of men accounts for about 20 percent of his 
teatime business he hopes to boost that figure with a marketing 
campaign promoting afternoon tea as a good opportunity to relax 
and conduct business 
steve johnson of the mayflower hotel said the growth in male 
customers for afternoon tea coincides with a general decline in 
alcoholic consumption and the lure of a quiet relaxed cafe 
atmosphere where the hubbub of the cocktail bar never intrudes on 
serious conversation 
all this is pleasant news to pollak 44 a civil trial lawyer 
for the district of columbia and bachelor chef who gives cooking 
classes for interested amateurs in the countrystyle kitchen of his 
townhouse in suburban alexandria va 
afternoon tea is one of the finest customs we have inherited 
from our english ancestors said pollak who instructs his 
students on the formal etiquette and proper preparation of an 
english tea which he frequently serves to his weekend dinner 
guests 
pollak shows his students how to cut a lemon in thin slices for 
resting in the bottom of teacups they learn to carve the crusts 
from tiny watercress and cucumber sandwiches they roll the dough 
on his antique oak kitchen table to make scones the biscuitshaped 
cake that traditionally is served with a dollop of clotted sweet 
cream 
litigation is very adversarial and aggressive says pollak 
who comes home exhausted from his 60hour work weeks teaching 
people how to prepare a gourmet meal or an afternoon tea gives me 
pleasure its not a battleground and everybody wins

a campaign celebrated today that has helped 
millions of americans quit smoking had its origins 15 years ago 
when a smalltown newspaper publisher printed the names of his 
neighbors who went cold turkey for a day 
todays great american smokeout stems from an idea by lynn 
smith former publisher of the weekly monticello times 
people said you couldnt get people to stop said smith 
founder of dont smoke day which was held jan 7 1974 in 
this mississippi river town 40 miles northwest of minneapolis i 
was ridiculed 
smith persuaded 291 of the towns 2300 residents to quit 
smoking for one day he said he put their names in print so they 
were on the record 
three years later the american cancer society began the great 
american smokeout held the third thursday of november the society 
hopes this year that 10 million smokers will give up their 
cigarettes for at least 24 hours 
nearly three of every 10 americans smoke according to adele 
paronie a spokeswoman for the cancer society thats down from the 
37 percent who smoked in 1974 the year of smiths first dday 
smith 69 continues to write a column in the times and hes 
still active in the campaign to end smoking 
he himself quit in 1954 after 19 years of smoking 
i had no idea it would reach such proportions smith said of 
the great american smokeout i was surprised and gratified that 
an idea could grow to such extent 
cancer society spokesman curtis allen who quit smoking 10 years 
ago after a smokeout said the societys goal is to get 20 percent 
of the estimated 50 million smokers to kick the habit today 
of those who tried quitting last year more than 54 million 
abstained for the entire 24 hours and 34 million stopped for at 
least one to three days allen said citing numbers from a gallup 
poll commissioned by the society 
smoking causes lung cancer heart disease and respiratory 
disease the surgeon general has warned of the potentially fatal 
risks of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine the active 
drug in cigarettes 
the tobacco institute a washington dcbased lobbying group 
for the tobacco industry said it will release a poll that it says 
shows smokers and nonsmokers are more tolerant of each other than 
most people believe 
tom lauria a spokesman for the institute said the poll found 
that 73 percent of adults polled believe that smoking by adults is

oncehuge stockpiles of taxpayerowned surplus 
farm commodities have continued to shrink an agriculture 
department report shows 
the departments commodity credit corp said wednesday that it 
had 98 billion invested in price support loans and actual 
inventories as of aug 31 that included 6 billion in loans and 
38 billion in the cccs inventory 
keith bjerke executive vice president of ccc a corporation 
wholly owned by the department said the total investment a year 
earlier was 162 billion including 95 billion in loans 
outstanding and inventories of 67 billion 
under price support programs financed by the ccc some major 
items mainly grains are mortgaged to the agency by farmers or 
put under loan while under loan the farmer still owns the 
commodity but cannot sell or use it until the debt to ccc is 
cleared 
producers have the option of repaying the loans and then selling 
or using the commodities as they choose or they may forfeit the 
products in lieu of repayment in which case the commodity is taken 
over by ccc and becomes part of its surplus inventory 
the dairy program is a major exception to this system no direct 
loan program is operated for milk producers but the ccc buys 
butter cheese and nonfat dry milk to support the price of milk 
paid to farmers by dealers the purchased products also become part 
of the ccc inventory 
other ccc holdings under loan and as inventory include wheat 
feed grains rice tobacco cotton soybeans honey and sugar 
the surplus commodities are used as a huge stockpile for use 
under a number of usda programs including food donations to 
schools and other institutions and food aid overseas 
certificates redeemable in cccowned commodities also have 
been used as export subsidies paid to private companies and as 
partial payments to farmers participating in some federal crop 
programs 
substantial reductions in ccc holdings from yearearlier levels 
have been going on for many months as supplies were drained off 
may 31 for example total holdings were valued at 135 billion 
down from 231 billion on may 31 1988 
in the case of major grain crops the 1988 drought reduced 
production and pushed up prices that reduced the need for price 
support loans and forfeitures market prices of some other products 
also were high enough to reduce the need for ccc purchases to 
bolster prices 
overall the report said commodities acquired by ccc during the 
first 11 months of the 1989 fiscal year that ended sept 30 had an 
acquisition value of about 276 billion compared with 121 
billion in the same period of 1988 
another factor in the ccc operation has been the farmerowned 
grain reserve which enables wheat and feed grains to be stored and 
kept off the market under government loan until prices rise enough 
to trigger their release the reserve is included in overall ccc 
holdings 
the report said that as of aug 31 the reserve consisted of 
2114 million bushels of wheat valued at 7571 million and 7675 
million bushels of feed grain worth 19 billion 
net losses to ccc totaled about 43 billion through aug 31 
compared with almost 124 billion for the same period in 1988 the 
report said the decline was due mostly to the smaller volume of 
grain moving into ccc inventories and reduced payments to farmers

the agriculture department says two farms near 
boone iowa are in friendly competition to test the merits of 
lowinput methods against more traditional ways of producing crops 
information will be gathered by usda scientists over a number of 
years to help determine which kind of farming is superior the 
departments agricultural research service said wednesday the 
study began last spring and results of the 1989 harvest are being 
analyzed 
jerry l hatfield of the usda agency said the iowa project is 
one of the first studies to combine basic scientific studies with 
an economic analysis 
two adjacent 40acre fields are being used he said one is part 
of a 300acre private research farm that belongs to dick and sharon 
thompson longtime advocates of lowinput sustainable agriculture 
designed to maintain the environment as well as the farm 
except for a few experimental plots the thompsons have used no 
pesticides or commercial nitrogen fertilizer on the land since 
1967 crop rotations are used including corn soybeans oats and 
hay 
the adjacent field is part of 1400 acres of corn and soybeans 
farmed by david snyder with minimum fall tillage he has rotated 
corn and soybean crops on his land for at least 15 years snyder 
uses pesticides and commercial fertilizers judiciously the 
report said 
hatfield director of the usda agencys national soil tilth 
laboratory in ames iowa is working with colleagues to conduct the 
farm comparison study 
they will evaluate the soil from the top down including the 
movement of pesticides and fertilizers and the potential for 
leaching to groundwater the report said 
the researchers also will be looking at earthworms and other 
soil organisms to determine what effects the farming methods have 
on them 
thompson says his main argument with snyder and other farmers is 
that they till land in the fall causing earthworm populations to 
decline 
initial samples show more worms in thompsons field but the 
report said the jury is still out on who has more worms

veterans secretary edward j derwinski is 
pledging to keep rural va hospitals open a promise lawmakers say 
they welcome but contend doesnt address all the healthcare 
problems for veterans who live in sparsely populated areas 
i have no intention of closing and no intention of making 
changes that in any way would diminish hospital care in rural 
areas derwinski told the senate veterans affairs committee 
these kinds of locations must stay 
derwinski referred specifically to hospitals in fargo nd hot 
springs sd martinsburg wva miles city mont prescott 
ariz and walla walla wash 
sen max baucus a montana democrat complained at wednesdays 
hearing that most washington policymakers lacked a sensitivity to 
the vast distances that people in the west must travel for health 
care 
sen thomas a daschle dsd complained that many rural 
veterans were being denied the health care to which they are 
accustomed va facilities he said have limited their treatment in 
the last five years to only the poorest veterans and those with 
serviceconnected disabilities 
we made a decision retroactively affecting these veterans that 
is just a disaster for these veterans said daschle adding that 
most are too old to enter private insurance programs 
there are veterans who are being turned away and they are 
getting sicker or dying as a result he said 
dr daniel winship of the vas medical division said there was 
no policy decision to cut the socalled category b and c patients 
he said that the demand for care by category a patients has 
virtually consumed the vas resources 
health care for rural veterans like rural health care in 
general suffers from a shortage of doctors and nurses difficult 
access to facilities and a lack of resources because most rural 
hospitals are not affiliated with medical schools 
the american legion says that 95 percent of all veterans live 
within a 100mile radius of the nearest va facility but 83 percent 
of the veterans served by the miles city mont hospital live more 
than 100 miles from it 
baucus noted that los angeles has nine centers compared with two 
in montana and derwinski said in his native chicago three 
hospitals were within six miles of one another

senate republicans thwarted in their efforts 
to cut capital gains taxes are looking to 1990 but key democrats 
say a reduction is no sure thing 
of course well consider capital gains next year said sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the taxwriting senate finance 
committee but he added it will be considered with other parts of 
a package for encouraging saving and investment 
one day we will have 60 votes to pass the capital gains tax 
cut sen bob packwood rore said wednesday shortly before the 
senate refused for the second consecutive day to shut off a 
democratic filibuster against the reduction 
each time the vote was 5147 for limiting debate nine short of 
the 60 needed all 45 republicans were joined by the same six 
democrats in favoring a limitation 
president bush who promised a capital gains tax cut during his 
campaign last year won a reduction in the house in september when 
60 democrats and all but one republican united behind the proposal 
the effort died in the senate because majority leader george j 
mitchell dmaine convinced some democrats who have favored a 
reduction that now is not the time 
bush contends that taxing capital gains profits from the sale 
of investments at a lower rate than applies to wages would 
encourage investment and create jobs 
if the capital gains tax is lowered some people will 
undertake transactions they would not otherwise undertake 
packwood said in turn you will raise money for the government 
by lowering the capital gains tax rate and we can use that money 
for other programs 
mitchell and bentsen criticized the reduction on grounds 80 
percent of the benefit would go to people with incomes over 
100000 a year it also would worsen the federal budget deficit 
they said 
it will be a fantastic windfall for the very wealthiest 
americans which the middle class will end up paying for through 
higher deficits or increased taxes mitchell said 
it is wrong just wrong that the president puts a higher 
priority on cutting capital gains taxes than on reducing the 
federal budget deficit 
packwoods plan would exclude a portion of capital gains from 
tax with a larger exclusion allowed for longerheld property for 
example 5 percent of the profits from the sale of assets owned 
more than one year would be excluded the exclusion would increase 
gradually to a maximum of 35 percent for property owned more than 
seven years 
the proposal also includes an amendment by sen bill roth 
rdel expanding individual retirement accounts a worker could 
contribute up to 2000 a year to an ira and get no immediate tax 
benefit however interest that accumulates would be taxfree 
forever 
on another budget front senate leaders hope to complete a 
bipartisan deficitreduction package designed to help break a 
housesenate deadlock over how to reduce this years 116 billion 
federal budget shortfall 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said the 
proposal could be unveiled before the end of the week and would 
pressure the house and bush administration to agree to a 
budgetcutting bill 
we think the legislative branch has a responsibility to 
produce its own deficit reduction bill and the executive 
branch has the responsibility to decide whether it wants to sign 
it sasser said 
lawmakers and white house officials have been squabbling over a 
deficitreduction measure for weeks because of that stalemate 16 
billion in cuts in most federal programs were imposed by the 
grammrudman law oct 1 and remain in effect 
the six democrats who sided with republicans on the vote 
wednesday are sens bennett johnston of louisiana howell heflin 
and richard shelby of alabama dennis deconcini of arizona david 
boren of oklahoma and joe lieberman of connecticut 
sens claiborne pell dri and spark matsunaga dhawaii did 
not vote both oppose the capitalgains tax cut

a us customs service hightech surveillance 
plane had a partial radar failure just as it was about to take the 
agencys new commissioner and the federal drug policy director 
on a vip demonstration flight 
the flight took place monday as scheduled for customs 
commissioner carol hallett and william bennett but the radar was 
unable to scan its full range of airspace because some power was 
out 
the aircraft uses sophisticated computer equipment to locate and 
track drugsmuggling aircraft 
it was picking up a multitude of targets customs service 
spokesman david hoover said wednesday concluding the flight was a 
success there was no perceptible difference in the way the radar 
works between high and low power 
however other customs service sources speaking only on 
condition they not be named said that a mission would normally 
have been aborted with a similar failure they said that on low 
power the radar can scan about 80 miles instead of the normal 250 
miles 
the vip mission was designed to show off the multicolored 
computer displays while taking bennett and mrs hallett from 
savannah ga to tampa fla where they were to speak at a drug 
conference 
hoover said wednesday that the difficulties began sunday night 
when one of the agencys two p3 airborne early warning aircraft 
left its base in corpus christi texas on a regular surveillance 
mission that plane had a failure in the radar system and returned 
to base 
the second p3 was sent monday to pick up the officials but a 
fluid pump in the cooling system failed in flight the system pumps 
vital coolant to the radar components which cannot be allowed to 
overheat 
the plane bound for savannah made an unscheduled landing in new 
orleans in an effort to fix the problem but to get the part 
customs officials had to fly the plane that was grounded sunday 
night to new orleans so the defective part could be switched 
the cooling system in the savannahbound plane was corrected 
but when the radar was turned on a spark knocked out the 
components that let the radar run on high power 
bennett knew there was some concern about the radar said 
his spokesman don hamilton but he had a great trip he enjoyed 
it he learned a lot of useful information

a select group of west german 
officials has been meeting this week to try to devise a strategy 
for making sure without appearing too meddlesome that the changes 
continue in east germany 
west germany is elated over east germanys opening of its 
borders a week ago as well as over promises by the ruling 
communists in east berlin of easing state control with sweeping 
political and economic reforms 
with an offer of massive financial assistance that has strings 
attached the bonn government is seeking to encourage the process 
yet it is trying hard not to invite charges it seeks to destabilize 
the east german leadership 
mikhail s gorbachev said this week that exporting 
capitalism could hurt the growing climate of cooperation in 
europe and also reaffirmed the soviet unions opposition to any 
suggestions of german reunification 
juergen chrobog spokesman for foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said interfering in east germanys internal affairs is 
the furthest thing from bonns intentions 
we dont want to interfere and take advantage of a weakened 
government we must give them time to develop he said wednesday 
a group of officials from eight federal ministries has since 
monday been holding closeddoor sessions to consider how to best 
support east germanys reform processes in the long term 
the group has been working on a catalog of possible ways to 
help east germany said chief government spokesman hans klein 
officials said the ideas included short and longterm economic 
assistance and how such aid could be best carried out 
improvements in cooperation in the areas of transportation 
telephone communications and environmental projects were also 
discussed 
west german officials are also considering setting up a special 
fund to finance improvements in east germany and to help east 
german visitors get the convertible currency they need to travel 
west bonn government sources said 
klein said rudolf seiters chancellor helmut kohls chief of 
staff would discuss the ideas with east german communist party 
chief egon krenz in east berlin on monday 
klein also indicated kohl might postpone a crucial summit with 
krenz until after an emergency dec 1517 congress of east 
germanys communist party that could choose a new party leadership 
west german government officials make no efforts to conceal 
their uncertainty over where east germany is headed 
concerning longterm help we have to have discussions with 
them to find out what their needs are what their problems are we 
dont even know what they want said chrobog 
herr seiters will go there east berlin and when he comes 
back we will make decisions said chrobog 
bonn has been sending out unclear signals on how much financial 
assistance it will pledge 
on saturday kohl told reporters economic assistance to east 
germany cannot be successful unless the system of a stateplanned 
economy gives way to a socially responsible market economy 
economics minister helmut haussmann on tuesday said a massive 
economic aid program for east germany should be contingent upon 
concrete economic reforms 
genscher on tuesday said bonn should not set conditions for its 
aid but that the reform process in east germany must show 
definite signals 
volker ruehe general secretary of kohls christian democrats 
said wednesday that some assistance could be offered to east 
germany soon including an overhaul of east germanys troubled 
telephone communications network and environmental projects 
but ruehe said farreaching changes in the current economic 
system are needed for east germany to be able to attract 
desperately needed private investment 
east germanys staterun news media as well as the countrys 
main opposition group new forum have indicated wariness over west 
germanys intentions 
new forum has expressed concern western capitalists might 
exploit an unstable east germany without helping its people and 
the countrys news media have warned against a sellout to west 
germany 
but klein rejected any suggestion that west germany wanted to 
impose its own type of economic system on its communist neighbor 
we export a lot of things but not capitalism he said

the labor department may have a major 
problem looming in the way it handles allegations of pension plan 
fraud says the chairman of a house panel in seeking a 
congressional audit of those investigations 
but an assistant labor secretary david george ball appeared 
before the house subcommittee on wednesday to dispute such warnings 
and take a moment to reassure the nations workers and retirees 
that the pension system is sound 
the acting labor department inspector general raymond maria 
said lax auditing and enforcement in the multibilliondollar 
private pension system have created a window of opportunity for 
unscrupulous managers to pilfer americans pensions 
subcommittee chairman rep bill hughes said of marias 
testimony i think that in the final analysis many of his 
conclusions are valid that we could have a major problem 
looming he said he is asking the general accounting office to 
look into the handling of 1600 cases investigated by the labor 
department last year 
hughes chairman of the subcommittee on retirement income and 
employment said the public need not panic but cautioned 
ignoring a situation where such large sums of money are subjected 
to few effective outside investiwttention the auditing process is 
slow and enforcement policies lean toward civil suits rather than 
criminal cases 
ball assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare 
benefits said his department was examining recommendations and 
added the pension system by any objective measure has never 
been healthier 
in an earlier interview hughes expressed skepticism about such 
assurances i heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan 
situation wasnt serious five years ago he said 
maria a former fbi agent said our goal is not to 
unnecessarily frighten people but to stimulate concern where such 
concern is needed and to avoid potential future crisis 
he also discussed infighting in the labor department which led 
to a justice department opinion in march barring his office from 
directly investigating private pension plans that job is handled 
by the departments pension benefits welfare administration which 
has 300 inspectors to police the nations 870000 private pension 
programs 
over the past five years more than 25 percent of the plans 
audited by the agency had violations of the 1974 employee 
retirement income security act known as erisa but the pbwa on 
average investigates less than 1 percent of the nations pension 
plans 
the inspector generals office wants the law changed to require 
private accountants who audit pension programs to report any 
violations to the labor department it also says the labor 
department should pursue more criminal cases against violators 
rather than relying largely on civil suits 
ball responded that the departments enforcement policy is 
designed to deliver the biggest bang for the buck and affecting 
the most participants possible 
the secretary and i intend to come down with hobnail boots on 
criminal violators he said 
in 1988 only 23 of the 1610 cases audited were classified as 
criminal cases 
ball said the labor department concentrates on plans covering 
more than 100 employees and targets its investigations on plans 
which we believe have a high chance of violating the law

seventyyearold evelyn blackwell is one of 
few elderly residents in her neighborhood who dares to stand up to 
the drug dealers 
weve got senior citizens who are afraid in their own homes 
and afraid to come out the longtime washington resident said 
wednesday 
miamis rosemary dalton 65 said seniors in her public housing 
project are afraid and sick and tired of the dope dealers 
you can smell the ether and they make so much noise you cant 
sleep dalton said 
elsie taylorjordan of alexandria va at 63 is raising her 
1yearold greatgranddaughter ashley abandoned by the babys 
drugaddicted mother 
being able to use drugs whenever she wanted was more important 
than caring for her child taylorjordan said 
americas elderly are silent casualties in the nations drug 
war isolated in crackinfested neighborhoods abused by violent 
addicts and left to rear babies abandoned by drugabusing parents 
a senate committee was told 
instead of finding refuge in their families many seniors suffer 
drugrelated violence at home at the hands of addicted relatives 
and neighbors brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman told 
the special committee on aging 
no bond of love can stand in the way of crack holtzman 
testified hundreds even thousands of older new yorkers are now 
vulnerable to murder to assault by their children grandchildren 
or greatgrandchildren desperate for their next fix of crack 
holtzman told of one case in which a brooklyn woman suffocated 
after her son tied her to a bed and set the room on fire because 
she refused to give him money for crack 
sgt robert crawford of the oakland police department in 
california said some elderly residents lose control of their homes 
when adult children or grandchildren turn the property into a haven 
for crack users 
many times the elderly person will ignore the activity and 
simply hide in a back bedroom crawford said when the police 
raids come he or she is left behind until the arrestee returns 
after posting bail or being released because of overcrowded jails 
the process then repeats itself 
committee chairman david pryor dark said the extent to which 
the elderly are being victimized by the drug crisis is difficult to 
measure because many keep silent due to a sense of fear and 
shame 
in preparing for this hearing we heard plenty of stories 
about abuse of the elderly as a result of drugs yet it was 
virtually impossible to find someone willing to make their story 
public pryor said 
sen john heinz rpa said his staff had a similar experience 
trying to find public witnesses from among elderly residents of a 
pennsylvania housing project where drug problems made life hell 
in a highrise 
they were afraid of reprisals they were afraid of telling the 
truth they didnt want the drug dealers to know heinz said 
heinz urged swift approval of legislation he has proposed to 
expedite the eviction of drug dealers from public housing projects 
pryor said that as congress puts more money into fighting drugs 
we must ensure that the often hidden victims of drug abuse are 
not forgotten 
holtzman said the popularity of crack has been a major reason 
for an upturn in violence against the elderly she said her office 
handled 400 percent more elderly abuse cases in 1988 than in 1986 
the year that crack use took off 
many more cases go unreported because parents and grandparents 
often are deeply ashamed about the violence visited upon them by 
their offspring or afraid of retaliation if they turn someone in 
holtzman said 
states need massive new resources for local law enforcement 
drug treatment education and prevention and services for drug 
abusers and victims holtzman said 
although both the president and congress have been aware of 
the enormity of americas drug crisis and proclaimed a war they 
have not funded one she said

a bill that would allow schools more 
flexibility in the use of federal education dollars in exchange for 
improving student performance gets a hearing today but one critic 
is calling the legislation nonsense 
i dont like it augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the 
house education and labor committee told reporters at the national 
press club this week 
i think its nonsense its part of deregulation but mr 
smith is very sincere about it i see nothing wrong with having the 
hearing 
the bill introduced by rep peter smith rvt would create a 
voluntary program allowing local schools more flexibility in the 
use of federal education dollars in exchange for improving student 
performance participation in the program would be canceled if 
student achievements worsen within two years 
among the scheduled witnesses are new jersey gov thomas kean 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
and stephanie robinson of the national urban league 
hawkins contends that a bill signed into law last year addresses 
many of the concerns raised in smiths bill 
trying new ideas when we already have success seems to be a 
foolish waste of money he said 
hawkins also complained that president bush and the nations 
governors failed to specify at a september education summit the 
federal regulations that are the most frustrating for educators 
to some extent im for simplification of regulations he 
said i would hope that this hearing will help find out what 
theyre talking about the president made a commitment to the 
governors that he would sponsor deregulation well obviously they 
want to get money with no strings attached but that doesnt mean 
its good for children 
smith an educator and former vermont lieutenant governor 
introduced the bill days before the historic education summit that 
concluded with an agreement that national performance goals would 
be developed and federal regulations tied to key education programs 
would be loosened 
in a joint statement bush and the governors said we want to 
swap red tape for results 
smith said the summit gave his bill the impetus it needed 
its a difference between night and day smith said in an 
interview wednesday the idea of restructuring is something that 
a number of us has been working on for five to six years its 
bipartisan but mostly at the gubernatorial and state commission 
level the summit propelled the idea onto the national agenda 
the bill specifies that the civil rights of students cannot be 
infringed in exercising local flexibility with federal dollars a 
provision smith said ensures that programs for disadvantaged 
students wont be shortchanged 
smith said he had gotten positive reaction from many members of 
congress although the national education association is more 
guarded and the national urban league insists it doesnt go far 
enough 
its a big change he said were talking about a major 
concept on how we relate to schools it ought to be controversial 
people ought to care deeply about it and ask tough questions about 
it

the no trespassing sign is out in montana 
for the yellowstone bison that is 
and violators will be shot 
the national park service promised wednesday to try to keep the 
northern herd of about 400 bison at yellowstone national park from 
roaming onto montana rangeland this winter as state officials said 
that once again they stand ready to shoot bison that wander north 
of the park 
last winter nearly 600 bison from the yellowstone herd were shot 
and killed by ranchers and hunters under the eyes of montana game 
wardens prompting an outcry from some environmentalists and animal 
rights organizations 
montana officials said the controlled harvesting of 
wandering bison is needed to protect ranchers although the state 
and park authorities have reached agreement on an interim bison 
management plan within the park 
montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or 
uncooperative said kl cool the states director of fish and 
wildlife during a visit to washington where he sought to explain 
the states policy 
if the bison leave the park they are fair game were 
faced with a threat to our own livestock industry he said the 
animal is not welcomed in montana 
bob barbee superintendent of yellowstone national park who 
along with cool met with reporters to discuss plans to deal with 
the bison problem this winter acknowledged that the northern herd 
has grown too large it is down to 400 bison from more than 900 
last year but is still at least 100 animals more than what park 
officials and authorities in montana say is manageable 
barbee said he and state officials have agreed on developing a 
bison management plan that would limit the northern herd to between 
200 and 300 animals at those numbers it is hoped the herd could be 
contained to the park he said 
but the park superintendent acknowledged that ways to reduce the 
herd have yet to be worked out short of letting them roam onto 
private rangeland and be killed he said he has no way of assuring 
that the bison now in the park will remain within its boundaries by 
january and february 
trying to herd a buffalo doesnt work buffalo are herded 
where they want to go said barbee adding that park workers hope 
to influence the big animals by gentle hazing perhaps by 
helicopter 
ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo that roam 
from the park damage property and threaten to infect cows with 
brucellosis a bacterial disease that causes cows to abort their 
calves montana has struggled for years and spent an estimated 30 
million to rid its cattle of the disease according to state 
officials 
although no cases have surfaced where montana cows have been 
infected from bison cool attributed that largely to efforts to 
keep the bison and cows separated blood tests have shown that more 
than half of the bison killed in the state last year had the 
disease he said 
yellowstone has about 2500 bison in three major herds on more 
than 24 million acres but ranchers are concerned only about the 
northern herd that grazes near the montana border 
montana officials national park service officials and many 
conservationists agree that the longterm answer to the bison 
problem is to control the number of buffalo in the park so that 
they are less inclined to roam for food and better habitat 
douglas inkley a wildlife resource specialist for the national 
wildlife federation suggests one answer might be to reintroduce a 
natural predator the rocky mountain wolf into the park 
barbee was careful to stay away from that idea proposals to 
reintroduce the wolf to yellowstone have been even more 
controversial among area ranchers than has the roaming bison

president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
before flying to cincinnati for a reunion with former president 
reagan tonight shamir was meeting today with members of the house 
foreign affairs and the senate foreign relations committees 
the 74yearold prime minister seemed tired and yet upbeat in 
summing up his sessions with bush and baker at a news conference 
late tuesday 
in principle i cannot see any deep differences between our 
positions and american positions he said its only a matter 
of details 
shamir whose proposal for talks with palestinian arabs had us 
support is seeking assurances the plo would not get a foot in the 
door of the negotiations 
he said he came away from his talks with bush and baker 
convinced that they will not do anything to force us to sit 
together and negotiate with them the plo if we do not want to 
shamir wants to restrict the talks with palestinians to setting 
up an election on the west bank and gaza the winners would 
negotiate with israel a form of limited selfrule for the 
palestinians 
but shamir said egypt in behalf of the plo has tried to 
broaden the agenda for the talks to other issues referring to the 
egyptian president he said hosni mubarak now understands it 
was a blunder 
earlier shamir said there are some obstacles that we have to 
remove and work out it will be a long process it will take time 
its not easy 
the plo dealing with the administration through egypt has not 
given a green light for palestinians on the west bank and in gaza 
to meet with israel to arrange the election 
baker said a response from egypt was essential for the talks to 
move ahead 
referring to israels conditional acceptance of his plan for the 
talks baker said i hope we will soon be receiving a similar 
response from egypt 
baker and shamir said they made progress toward negotiations 
but a senior us official who requested anonymity said i cant 
tell you that we have sorted out specific details 
before shamir called on bush there were reports of us 
impatience with israel for seeking various assurances on the 
discussions 
after the session shamir and us officials struck a friendly 
stance 
there is no more tension shamir said he also told 
reporters i think we made some progress 
marlin fitzwater the presidential spokesman said bush was not 
frustrated with shamir over the delay in getting to the table 
its important not to become impatient when youre dealing 
with the middle east fitzwater said two thousand years is the 
normal wait for things to happen 
bush also took up two other touchy issues with shamir israels 
military cooperation with south africa and an expansion of jewish 
settlements on the west bank and in gaza 
last week a us official who demanded anonymity said there 
was very great concern that israel may have provided us 
technology to south africa for a missile test last summer 
and on tuesday margaret d tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman denounced as an obstacle to peace a planned israeli 
settlement in northern gaza 
shamir has insisted on the right of jews to live anywhere 
asked about israels south african connection he said military 
contracts had been reduced to the greatest extent in the past 
2 years 
there is no question about it shamir said we are not 
busy with any nuclear arms

president bush says no government should stand 
in the way of changes sweeping eastern europe but promises that 
next months summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
not be used to negotiate the future of europe 
bush made his statement wednesday after gorbachev reaffirmed his 
firm opposition to german reunification despite the opening of the 
berlin wall 
gorbachev said in moscow the existence of two germanys has 
been recognized by the world community since the end of world war 
ii and that even talk about reunification constitutes interference 
in the affairs of the two countries 
bush in a speech to a convention of the aflcio reiterated his 
call for a europe whole and free but did not directly call for 
a reunified germany which us policy envisions 
before an audience that included solidarity leader lech walesa 
bush said he watched in awe last week as berliners danced atop the 
berlin wall 
he said he had expected to see the wall opened during his 
lifetime and hoped it would happen during his presidency 
change has a way of sweeping through like a fastmoving 
train bush said and no one and no government should stand in 
its way 
while praising the easing of travel restrictions in 
czechoslovakia bush said freedom of travel is not enough only 
free and unfettered elections can satisfy the yearnings of a free 
people 
bush and gorbachev will meet dec 2 and 3 on ships in the 
mediterranean off the coast of malta the president then may go on 
to brussels to report to nato allies on the trip 
the president said he and gorbachev are not meeting to 
negotiate the future of europe 
the peoples of eastern europe are speaking their own minds 
about that future and they are calling for democracy freedom of 
the press and of conscience the right of the governed to choose 
their leaders bush said 
the agenda of the next months summit and expectations of any 
accomplishments appear to be shifting as the meeting approaches 
bush originally said the meeting would not be an armscontrol 
summit but the white house said wednesday that arms negotiations 
will be discussed 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush and 
gorbachev likely would reach a consensus in their thinking for 
progress to reduce strategic nuclear forces and conventional arms 
in europe however he said it was quite doubtful that any 
papers would be signed 
the press spokesman acknowledged that washington and moscow were 
sparring over the summits outcome 
he said the soviets have a tendency to build expectations 
before a summit and we have a tendency to play them down 
i suspect the reality is somewhere in the middle he said 
but i would urge you to discount theirs a little bit on the top 
side

plans to extend the life of the embattled us 
civil rights commission for six months are on their way to the 
senate after winning approval from the house 
the bill approved wednesday was designed to keep the commission 
from automatically going out of business at the end of the month 
but keep it on the front burner in view of its recent problems the 
vote was 278135 
approval of the stopgap measure by the full house came a day 
after it emerged from the judiciary committee amid concerns that 
action was necessary to reconstitute the commission and end its 
internal strife 
an alternative gop plan would have deliberately put the 
commission out of business for one day only to give president 
bush a chance to dump the current members it then would have been 
reconstituted for six years 
democrats said it would be unwise to go ahead with a sixyear 
bill with lawmakers about to wrap up their business and go home 
until after the holidays 
rep don edwards dcalif said he initially had favored a 
oneyear measure but bowed to the belief of sen paul simon 
dill that six months was time enough to resolve the issue 
in the 1960s civil rights forces hailed the commissions 
hearings across the south its ringing reports on racial injustice 
and bold legislative proposals since 1983 however the atmosphere 
has soured and both parties in congress have combined to slash the 
panels funding 
controversy has focused on former chairman william b allen who 
remains a member of the commission he recently came under fire 
after delivering to a conservative group a speech titled blacks 
animals homosexuals what is a minority 
the commission in a 61 vote called the speech thoughtless 
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory allen who is black 
calls himself the only conservative on the panel and says he does 
not believe in coddling people 
lawmakers say hes not alone in fanning the controversy and that 
at least one other member of the commission has made bizarre 
remarks

the bush administration has launched a covert 
effort to overthrow panamas gen manuel a noriega with the 
acquiescence of the senate and house intelligence committees a 
newspaper reported thursday 
the cia has been authorized to spend 3 million initially to 
sponsor a coup by recruiting panamanian military officers or other 
dissidents the los angeles times reported 
the covert operation has no restrictions beyond an order 
prohibiting noriegas assassination and the use of us troops 
along with other high risk options are under consideration the 
newspaper said 
the times quoted an unidentified source as calling the operation 
an unimpeded effort to try to topple noriega 
were going into it with the understanding that there may be 
loss of life though the effort will be not to kill anyone the 
source told the times 
a white house press spokesman was not immediately available for 
comment on the report 
the united states has been trying to force noriega from power 
since he was indicted on drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 
by federal grand juries in miami and tampa fla 
after a coup by members of the panama defense forces on oct 3 
failed congressional critics assailed the bush administration for 
its restrained response to that attempt 
bush administration officials outlined the current operation 
three weeks ago before the senate and house intelligence 
committees the times said the officials made it clear that the 
administration is no longer willing to negotiate an alternative 
that would allow noriega to avoid criminal prosecution in the 
united states

the bush administrations nominee to head the 
nations nuclear arms production says he unavoidably made enemies 
during 23 years as a regulator of atomic power but that charges of 
professional misconduct are unfounded 
its a bum rap victor stello jr said at his confirmation 
hearing wednesday acknowledging that his personality played a part 
in having gained many enemies 
i say what i think im aggressive im not a diplomat 
i can be abrasive he said adding that he was fully committed to 
ensuring safe nuclear operations 
stello rebutted several charges raised by democratic members of 
the senate armed services committee including that he was too cozy 
with the utilities he was responsible for regulating while chief of 
staff of the nuclear regulatory commission 
the committee scheduled a further hearing for this afternoon to 
take testimony from individuals who asked to speak either in favor 
or against the stello nomination 
the committee chairman sam nunn dga said a third session 
was likely friday and that stello might be asked to return for 
additional testimony that appeared to mean the administration 
stood little chance of gaining full senate confirmation of stello 
before congress recesses for the year probably next week 
democratic sens edward kennedy of massachusetts and timothy 
wirth of colorado told stello they would vote against his 
nomination as assistant energy secretary for defense programs sen 
john glenn of ohio strongly hinted he would too 
kennedy accused stello of corruption of the processes and 
procedures of the nuclear regulatory commission and said he 
bears a major share of the responsibility for an erosion of 
public confidence in the regulation of nuclear power 
few nominees have arrived before this committee with a longer 
train of excess baggage than victor stello jr kennedy said i 
intend to oppose this nomination 
stello has been the nrcs chief of staff ranking below only the 
five commissioners since 1986 he was nominated for the energy 
department job july 24 
if confirmed stello would be responsible for nuclear weapons 
production the main activity of the energy department key 
facilities in the weapons complex which comprises 17 major plants 
in 12 states have been shut down in recent months because of 
severe safety management and environmental problems 
energy secretary james d watkins made an unusual personal plea 
on behalf of the nominee telling the committee he had no 
reservations about stellos fitness to serve 
i am more convinced today than ever before that he is the 
right man for the job watkins said 
the charges against stello include allegations that he 
improperly advised the tennessee valley authority in 1986 on how to 
respond to an nrc investigation of tvas nuclear program and that 
he authorized cash payments for information from a former utility 
worker in 1988 in an effort to undermine an nrc investigator 
stello said he could assure the committee that those and other 
allegations were groundless 
sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
committee said he saw no reason for congress to question bushs 
judgment in choosing stello but several democrats said many doubts 
about stellos fitness had not been dispelled

congressional approval of a 305 billion 
defense bill that slashes president bushs request for the 
strategic defense initiative has left even the strongest backers of 
star wars doubting its future 
why waste money for sdi if its not the presidents intention 
or the congress intention to deploy sen malcolm wallop 
rwyo asked wednesday shortly before the senate overwhelmingly 
agreed to the fiscal 1990 military bill 
the legislation approved 918 cuts 11 billion from the 
presidents proposal of 49 billion for sdi about 279 million 
less than the fiscal 1989 amount and the first budget reduction in 
the program in six years 
bush is expected to sign the bill which trimmed his request for 
other major strategic programs such as the mx and midgetman nuclear 
missiles and the b2 stealth bomber 
the house meanwhile approved by voice vote a companion 
military spending bill that provides the money to implement the 
policies in the defense legislation 
the 286 billion spending bill which goes to the senate for its 
consideration largely mirrors the defense legislation on funds for 
sdi landbased nuclear missiles and the b2 bomber 
the house eliminated a handful of contentious issues including 
an amendment providing house speaker thomas s foley dwash with 
an air force c20 aircraft at andrews air force base in maryland 
ready at his request 
the substitute amendment allows foley the use of an air force 
aircraft when he needs it consistent with current practice 
among the other prickly issues dropped from the bill was an 
amendment providing a classified amount of money for the sr71 spy 
plane a program the administration decided to cancel 
however lawmakers may have created more problems when they 
eliminated about 90 million earmarked for university projects in 
the home districts of house and senate members 
the spending bill cuts 400 million from the administrations 
request for 18 billion for procurement of the trident 2 missile 
and 11 million from the administrations 216 million request for 
testing the troubled missile 
that bill also prohibits spending more than 250 million on the 
program until three successful flight tests have occurred in 
august the weapon suffered its second successive failure in 
undersea test firings exploding seconds after being launched 
in the senate the chairman of the armed services committee 
democrat sam nunn of georgia said the defense bill continues 
strategic modernization at a somewhat slower rate than the 
administration sought 
but wallop bemoaned the fate of sdi particularly in light of the 
republican administrations inaction 
i must fault the administration for failing to fight harder 
for sdi funding and not sticking to their own pronouncements on the 
importance of the program said wallop who voted against the 
bill 
overall the bills provide 43 billion for the b2 430 
million less than the administration requested for the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
money is included for two bombers in fiscal 1990 one less than 
the administration sought but adopts bushs proposal for 
components for five bombers in fiscal 1991 
approximately 11 billion is included for two landbased 
nuclear missiles the multiplewarhead railbased mx and the 
singlewarhead truckbased midgetman the bills trim about 150 
million from the administrations request for the two weapons and 
includes house language imposing a 50missile cap on the mx 
the legislation provides for the navys f14d tomcat jet fighter 
and the ahip helicopter for one more year and postpones a 
decision on the marine corps v22 osprey and the phoenix missile 
the bills accept the administrations plan to kill six other 
programs including the ssn688 submarine the f15 aircraft and 
the m88 tank recovery vehicle

just hours after polish labor leader lech 
walesa made a passionate plea for us funds a foreign aid bill 
offering the first installment of that help was sidetracked by an 
unrelated abortion dispute in the senate 
the domestic politics of one of americas most volatile issues 
intervened late wednesday to send the 146 billion foreign aid 
measure back to the house for further action as walesa dined with 
lawmakers in the capitol just a few yards from the senate floor 
while the bill which provides military and economic aid in the 
coming year to us friends and allies around the globe still was 
expected to pass further delays could throw prospects for 533 
million in aid to poland and hungary into doubt for this year 
earlier in the day walesa appealed in strong terms for us 
financial support and investment to keep polands dramatic changes 
alive some lawmakers in the audience sported lapel buttons that 
read make the check to lech 
the issue that delayed the bill was a senate provision to send 
15 million to the united nations population fund a family 
planning agency that has been barred from receiving us funds for 
five years because it operates in china which has repressive 
population control policies 
antiabortion forces object to the money because of chinas 
onechildperfamily policy which they say has led to forced 
abortions and sterilizations 
the house had effectively deleted the money a day earlier but 
the senate voted 5244 to insist it remain in the bill proponents 
pointed out that the bill would bar any of the us contribution 
from being used in china 
another provision added in the senate on wednesday also could 
cause problems for the bill a ban on counting illegal aliens in 
the upcoming national census the measure was pushed by sen 
richard shelby dala and approved on a 5048 vote 
throughout the day wednesday house and senate negotiators also 
talked informally in an effort to come to agreement on separate 
legislation setting the shape and size of an overall threeyear aid 
package for poland and hungary the senate had passed a version 
totaling 738 million the house an 838 million bill 
both poland and hungary have led the way in the political and 
economic reform movement sweeping eastern europe and congress has 
sought to encourage the changes with us aid 
the money bill also remained subject to a veto threat because of 
a provision stemming from the irancontra scandal that would bar 
use of foreign aid to entice other countries to carry out policies 
contrary to us law the administration believed the language 
would tie its hands in dealings with allies

its tiring being the toast of washington so 
lech walesa called it a day early and missed some of the accolades 
being heaped upon him 
walesa exhausted after a day in which he made a triumphant 
appearance before congress abruptly left a dinner in his honor at 
the capitol on wednesday night saying he was too tired to continue 
the day has taken some toll and he is tired and he regrets 
having to depart said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
a glittering assembly had gathered in statuary hall to hail the 
leader of polands solidarity labor union as the hero of the day 
however the dinner continued after walesa left and rep dan 
rostenkowski dill his voice quavering and his eyes brimming 
with tears expressed the pride he said all polishamericans feel 
at walesas achievements 
lech walesa today made a speech that was so simple so direct 
so honest rostenkowski said he is a man who says i know what 
freedom is because i havent had it 
walesa at a luncheon after his address before congress 
described his speech simply 
it was too long i am not a good speaker 
not too long by senate standards said senate majority leader 
george mitchell of maine by those standards it was a very short 
speech 
in addition he had something to say said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas 
dole said that as walesa walked into the house chamber he turned 
to him and said 
if the lights go out i can fix them before i give the speech 
i would like you to understand i really am an electrician i never 
wanted to be a diplomat 
he had never understood he said how much responsibility 
one takes on when one assumes the role of a leader 
now he said i must be what you want me to be 
walesa who spoke through an interpreter said he could not 
pronounce the names of his hosts 
but in many cases he was wrong 
seated near him were zbigniew brzezinski national security 
adviser in the carter administration sen frank murkowski 
ralaska sen barbara mikulski dmd and many other 
polishamericans of achievement and rank 
rostenkowski led a standing ovation on the house floor when 
walesa described solidaritys long battle for survival and its 
eventual triumph and said 
we did not smash a single window pane but we were stubborn 
very stubborn ready to suffer we knew what we wanted and our 
power prevailed in the end 
walesas speech had personal meaning for many 
ms mikulski wore her greatgrandmothers scarf hand 
embroidered with the arms of poland and handed down in her family 
daughter to daughter 
his triumph is the fulfillment of a dream that my family have 
had for more than 100 years that poland is free and on the way to 
democracy the senator said

the index erased some of its gains as the yens weakness against 
the dollar discouraged market players said kazuyuki suzuki a 
dealer with daiwa securities co 
other dealers said sales for profit taking by some investors 
also helped narrow the indexs gains 
although the indexs gain is not that big trading was pretty 
active suzuki said 
in currency dealings the dollar was slowly getting stronger 
against the yen as many investors expected the us trade deficit 
in september to shrink from the previous month dealers said 
the us commerce department is to announce its monthly trade 
statistics in washington later thursday the figures are seen as a 
major economic indicator of the us economy 
a bank of tokyo trader anonymously said market players were

the future of ceasefire talks between 
nicaraguas rival factions is in question today after sandinista 
delegates said the contra rebels had second thoughts just when an 
agreement seemed within reach 
the key element of an eightpoint draft proposal a copy of 
which was obtained by the associated press called for the 
withdrawal of 2000 contra forces from nicaragua to rebel camps in 
honduras as part of a ceasefire agreement 
the proposal was the principal working document of the two sides 
as they met wednesday for the fifth time in seven days in an 
attempt to restore the truce president daniel ortega suspended nov 
1 
after about three hours of discussions the contra delegation 
stunned the sandinistas in early evening by asking for a weeklong 
suspension of the talks 
we had made a lot of progress today said the chief 
sandinista negotiator victor hugo tinoco it was a total 
surprise that they decided to break off the talks 
but contra spokesman bosco matamoros denied that significant 
progress had been made asserting that statements to the contrary 
were not accurate and that the sandinista negotiators showed a 
lack of flexibility in the discussions 
he defended the call for a recess by saying that after many 
hours of talks dating back to last thursday a time for 
reflection was appropriate 
after rethinking their earlier proposal for a sevenday recess 
the contras announced after 11 pm that they would return this 
morning to discuss next steps with the sandinistas and with 
organization of american states and united nations mediators 
the scene of the talks was an eightstory oas office building 
three blocks from the white house 
there was a bizarre twist when according to tinoco the contra 
delegation asked for a 30minute recess to talk things over among 
themselves only to disappear for two hours 
we dont know where they are tinoco told reporters shortly 
after 10 pm they are somewhere in this building he and 
fellow delegates then left for their hotel 
the contra decision to ask for a weeks recess just when the 
talks seemed on the verge of success prompted sandinista 
speculation that a hidden state department hand had nipped the 
proposal in the bud 
sandinista partisans prowled stairwells throughout the building 
searching for us diplomats but came up emptyhanded the official 
us policy is that the state department gives advice to the 
contras but is not directly involved in the discussions 
restoring the cease fire is considered an important goal because 
national elections are set for nicaragua on feb 25 
an american negotiator for the sandinistas paul reichler 
sounded incredulous when he talked to reporters about the perceived 
change of contra attitudes 
on the verge of reaching an agreement theyre breaking off 
the talks he said it does not make sense unless the contras 
do not want an agreement of any kind 
he wondered whether the sudden appearance at the talks of contra 
chief of staff israel galeano otherwise known as comandante 
franklin was related to the rebel retreat 
other key points in the draft proposal included 
verification of the cease fire by a united nations force 
scheduled to take up peacekeeping duties in central america shortly 
a pledge by the contras not to dispatch any forces into 
nicaragua from base camps in honduras in addition to withdrawing 
2000 of their estimated 5000 troops based in nicaragua 
a request to central american presidents to extend from dec 5 
the deadline set aug 7 for concluding the demobilization of the 
contras 
a contra delegation would travel to nicaragua in the last week 
of november to determine if political conditions will permit the 
safe return to nicaragua of rebel combatants

metropolitan fiber systems inc is asking the 
justice department and federal communications commission to allow 
alternative telecommunications carriers to compete for local 
telephone access services 
the regional bell and other operating companies provide local 
phone access for all longdistance carriers nearly 50 cents of 
every dollar spent on longdistance services goes to the bell 
companies for access fees totaling about 20 billion a year 
anthony j pompliano president of mfs based in the chicago 
suburb of oakbrook terrace ill said wednesday his company was 
asking the justice department to enforce the modified final 
judgment to require that local access be unbundled to the 
fullest extent possible to permit fair and equitable competition 
also he said we are asking the fcc to mandate that 
alternative local telecommunications carriers can costeffectively 
interconnect and locate equipment at bell facilities 
that means mfs and similar alternative carriers can install 
their equipment in bellowned switch sites and hook up to the user 
community via the bell network pompliano said 
a gray collins bell atlantic senior vice president for 
external affairs said mfs was free to use bell atlantics 
services any way it wants and it is free to connect its own 
network with bell atlantics 
metropolitan fiber however is demanding more than this it 
is demanding collocation which is in effect the ability to set 
up their shop in our store bell atlantic has no legal obligation 
to do this but it has agreed to meet a number of metropolitans 
requests collins said

toxic waste sites at 27 defense department and 
energy department facilities are being added to the priority list 
for cleanup under the federal superfund program according to the 
environmental protection agency 
the federal facilities were among 29 sites added to the list 
wednesday bringing the total number of sites scheduled for 
priority cleanup to 1219 of those 79 sites are on facilities 
belonging to the federal government 
the latest to be added included toxic waste sites at 19 defense 
department facilities and eight energy department facilities 
including a number of atomic weapons manufacturing or processing 
plants 
concern about hazardous wastes at the atomic weapons plants has 
previously been made public 
the two nongovernment sites added to the list were the forest 
glen mobile home subdivision in niagara falls ny and the radium 
chemical site in new york city 
earlier this year the department of health and human services 
recommended that residents of the two sites be moved because of a 
threat to public health 
last february the epa acting under an emergency provision 
removed waste material that was believed to be the source of 
unhealthy levels of radiation at the radium chemical site in new 
york adding the site to the superfund list will allow completion 
of the cleanup of the contaminated building officials said 
the department of health and human services issued a health 
advisory to residents of the forest glen mobile home subdivision in 
niagara falls last july because of concern about contamination from 
toxic materials in the soil 
the epa offered to temporarily relocate residents but it was 
not known wednesday how many of the residents had moved 
here are the defense department facilities at which hazardous 
wastes sites were added to the cleanup list

maria zubarria of apartment 43 
in zacamils housing block 111a is swollen like a bullfrogs throat 
because her cancer treatment is three days overdue 
juan alberto ponce has carried a white flag up and down 
conacastes alleys no 3 and 4 dozens of times searching in vain 
for a way through fierce combat to alley 8 where his family has 
been holed up for four days 
dr ricardo mendez of soyapangos psychiatric hospital has 
worked since sunday without sleep and for two days without food 
because the hospital is in the middle of an urban battlefield and 
relief for him and his staff has not arrived 
though hundreds of leftist guerrillas and soldiers of the 
rightist government have been killed and wounded in this weeks 
battle for san salvador it is the capitals civilian population 
that is taking the brunt of the suddenly and drastically escalated 
civil war 
more than 100 noncombatants have been killed and civilians 
make up about half the 1600 total wounded according to 
stillsketchy casualty figures on fighting that began saturday 
night 
president alfredo cristiani has accused insurgents of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front of entrenching themselves 
in densely populated workingclass neighborhoods so they are 
shielded by noncombatants 
the presence of thousands of civilians around dugin rebels has 
not prevented the government from sending rocketfiring helicopters 
and warplanes with heavycaliber machine guns against guerrilla 
strongholds 
thousands of homes have been damaged or wrecked in nearly 
continuous strafing of the outlying neighborhoods where the 
insurgents are making a stand 
a reporter races across the clearing separating zacamils 
sixstory apartment complexes from the barricaded streets assault 
rifle fire ringing through the passages between the buildings and 
smacking into their facades 
guerrillas keep watch at both ends of each floor sighting down 
their sovietdesgined ak47s toward soldiers up the road and 
occassionally squeezing off short bursts 
eduardo rodriguez who lives in apartment 42 next to the 
cancerstricken mrs zubarria crouches behind the low wall of the 
fourth floor hallway 
we want to get out of here he says under his breath so the 
guerrillas a few yards away dont hear to the justarrived 
reporter 
later inside his small apartment with his wife adriana and 
their children he tells how they have almost run out of water and 
are low on tortillas the only food they have left 
they wont let us leave says mrs rodriguez softly with a 
gesture with her chin toward the external hallway where the rebels 
crouch were their protection 
alberto davila finally decided to take up what he and his wife 
angela could carry from their home in conacaste early wednesday 
and flee along with thousands of others who streamed out of the 
neighborhood beneath white flags 
mrs davila tears streaming down her face clutched her 
6yearold daughters hand as they paused in their flight 
its terrible its terrible she sobbed as several 
residents hurried by with an improvised stretcher carrying a 
middleaged woman her jaw blown off by a bullet or shrapnel deep 
in shock she sat straightbacked on the rig and stared straight 
ahead with glazed eyes 
we stayed this long because we didnt want to leave the house 
abandoned said davila 
mrs rodriguez of zacamil echoed that sentiment 
she and her family have hung on in zacamil despite the combat 
because once we leave we must be resigned to losing everything 
theyll just take it all but now were willing to go with just 
the clothes we have on 
perhaps the only civilians in soyapango not distraught by the 
death and destruction surrounding them this week are the catatonics 
or severely psychotics among the 360 patients at dr mendezs 
hospital 
but oblivion or delusion cannot keep them entirely immune from 
the war and its consequences 
they have not eaten in more than 48 hours either

a drug recently approved for parkinsons disease 
appears to be the first to slow down the crippling disorder and may 
be the first effective treatment for a degenerative brain ailment 
a major study today confirms 
the study conducted on 800 people began in 1987 and was 
scheduled to continue until late next year but because of the 
drugs dramatic effect the researchers ended the study in february 
in order to provide the medicine to the patients in the control 
group which received placebos 
the drug deprenyl helped prevent people from becoming sick 
enough to require levodopa the standard medicine for symptoms of 
the incurable disease that afflicts about 500000 americans 
it does not stop the disease said dr ira shoulson but 
it may well slow the disease this may be the first treatment for a 
neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease 
until now levodopa had been the main treatment easing symptoms 
but not slowing the disease doctors usually refrain from 
prescribing levodopa until relatively severe symptoms develop 
because it loses its effectiveness after about a year 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine was 
conducted by members of the parkinson study group at 28 medical 
centers in the united states and canada 
the researchers wrote that the results translate into a delay 
in the development of disability of nearly one year and an extended 
capacity for fulltime employment 
over 12 years this might buy 50 percent more time of less 
impaired disability said shoulson who directed the study at the 
university of rochester medical center 
in the research 399 people with early untreated parkinsons 
were given deprenyl while 401 others received another experimental 
medicine or dummy pills during the followup 97 of those who got 
deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa compared with 176 in the 
comparison group 
the doctors are not sure how the deprenyl prevented the patients 
from reaching their need for levodopa 
the disease attacks the brain and results in symptoms such as 
shuffling gait shaking and difficulty talking it typically 
strikes people in their 50s and 60s 
at the start of the study peoples symptoms included mild 
tremors stiffness and slow movement by the time they needed 
levodopa they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for 
themselves 
deprenyl sold under the brand name eldepryl was approved by 
the us food and drug administration for routine use in september 
in a separate study scientists at the university of california 
san diego said that genetically modified cells grafted into the 
brains of rats had reduced the animals symptoms of parkinsons 
disease 
the researchers whose results were published wednesday in 
proceedings of the national academy of science said the implanted 
cells were genetically altered to produce a chemical lacking in the 
brains of parkinsons patients 
the research may help provide an alternative to fetal cell 
implants which have proven effective but is embroiled in the 
abortion controversy the bush administration this month extended a 
ban on federal financing of research in which human fetal tissue 
from induced abortions is transplanted into human patients 
the scientists genetically altered the rats skin cells to make 
them produce ldopa a chemical that is lacking in the brain of 
parkinsons patients levodopa is the synthetic drug used as a 
substitute for ldopa to treat the disease 
when the genetically altered cells were transplanted into the 
rats brains an average 40 percent reduction in abnormal behavior 
was seen said ucsd neuroscientist fred gage

causing a stir in the italian cultural world a new 
book and a newspaper have disclosed that nobel laureate eugenio 
montale signed literary articles that were actually written by a 
friend 
the countrys literati had considered montale the leading 
italian poet of the 20th century 
the milanbased newspaper il giornale recently published a 
series of letters montale wrote in 1950 to an american friend 
henry furst asking him to put together several book reviews that 
would appear under montales name 
the deal also was detailed in a book about furst published this 
month dry branches by mario soldati 
the disclosures surprised italians who grew up revering the 
verses of the reclusive montale including occasions 
finisterre and a collection titled cuttlefish bones 
montale who often wrote of the sea in his native genoa won the 
nobel prize in literature in 1975 he died in 1981 at age 85 
most commentators have expressed sympathy for montale who 
according to soldati arranged for the ghostwritten articles 
during a period in which he was very tired and felt unable to write 
another controversy has developed over a column by an italian 
communist politician and poet pietro ingrao who said montale had 
a right to deceive since capitalist society did not permit an 
artist to make a living from poetry 
in the letters published in il giornale montale told furst he 
could not fulfill his contract to write a monthly review of an 
english or american book for the prestigious milan newspaper 
corriere della sera 
the poet asked the american writer to do it for him and 
promised to turn over the payment he would have received 
the problem for me is the reading not the writing of the 
article montale wrote according to the published letters 
it takes me a lot of effort even to read an italian book 
imagine an english book no one can imagine the life i am leading 
and if they knew at the newspaper instead of feeling sorry for 
me they would show me the door 
montale said he wanted to keep the contract with the newspaper 
since he did not have much income 
in time i will do the work but now it is already 
something if i dont imitate pavese he wrote referring to the 
wellknown writer cesare pavese 
in other letters montale thanks furst for sending reviews 
cautions him not to make them too elegant and says that he has 
given a more positive tone to fursts review of a book by ernest 
hemingway since i know the author and i am part of a jury for 
the prize named after him 
furst an author in his own right was close friends with many 
european writers in the 1950s and served for a time as literary 
correspondent from italy for the new york times according to il 
giornale 
the montale case has become an occasion for raising again 
the inexhaustible arguments about the shadowy collaborators of the 
greats of literature said the italian weekly newsmagazine 
panorama 
ingrao said in a frontpage article in the communist newspaper 
il manifesto that montale had the right to deceive his newspaper 
being that we are not able or willing to guarantee a poet even 
the liberty to search to interrogate to interrogate himself in 
idleness 
he described montales act as rebellion against a consumer 
society 
but columnist paolo mieli responded in the turinbased daily la 
stampa there remains the sensation that this attempt to cast the 
episode in terms of politics and ideology is false above all when 
compared with the intense drama of those longago letters to 
furst

the people that are smoking now are pretty hard core

in 1905 pablo picasso painted au lapin 
agile a parisian tavern scene for his suppers in 1989 
philanthropist walter annenberg bought it for 407 million 
the painting in which picasso depicts himself as a harlequin 
had been described by john l marion chairman of sothebys north 
america as the most important 20thcentury picture to come up for 
auction 
wednesdays price fell within the presale estimate but left it 
behind another famous selfportrait painted four years earlier 
yo picasso sold for 4785 million at sothebys in may a 
record for the artist and more than double its presale estimate 
the record for any work of art 539 million was set in 1987 
for vincent van goghs irises 
we were a little disappointed it didnt pass yo picasso 
said john payson whose sister linda de roulet consigned au 
lapin agile 
paysons and mrs de roulets mother art collector and former 
new york mets owner joan whitney payson acquired the painting in 
1952 for 60000 
she displayed it in her long island home and bequeathed it to 
her daughter irises also came from the collection 
john payson had said his sister offered the picasso because the 
prices commanded by irises and yo picasso made her a bit 
nervous having the painting in her house 
mrs de roulet said she would establish a foundation for medical 
research and education with part of the proceeds 
annenberg of rancho mirage calif the former us ambassador 
to london and friend of former president reagan was in the auction 
house but bid by phone said diana brooks president of sothebys 
north america 
marion said annenbergs collection had just about everything 
but a great picasso 
while subdued in comparison with other recent auctions 
wednesday nights sale drew an estimated 1500 people totaled 
2695 million and set records for 12 artists 
among other highlights 
picassos the mirror one of a series of portraits of 
sleeping women done in 1932 sold for 264 million to japanese 
dealer shigeki kameyama 
picassos mere et enfant which dates from 1921 when the 
artists son was born sold for 187 million to a private japanese 
collector 
edouard manets la promenade sold for 148 million to a 
japanese dealer

all prices include a 10 percent premium 
young girls at the piano a renoir pastel produced in 1892 on 
commission from the french government failed to sell the renoir 
had been expected to bring up to 30 million but the high bid was 
175 million 
au lapin agile which means the agile rabbit was the name 
of the tavern frequented by picasso 
he painted au lapin agile when he was 25 it shows him and a 
woman model germaine pichot standing at a bar brooding and 
disenchanted with one another picasso had blamed pichot for 
causing his best friends suicide 
the big question in the picture is whether or not at the time 
it was painted picasso was actually having an affair with this 
woman brooks said 
a photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed 
in a bar 
i painted it in exchange for free meals and drinks picasso

were a crib toy that its own manufacturer had warned to keep out 
of babys reach a doll and play clothes by playskool and chewing 
gum cigarettes 
swartz called the toys on his 18th annual list a time bomb 
ready to explode 
a spokeswoman for a trade group representing 240 companies that 
account for 90 percent of the domestic toy market downplayed the 
criticism 
he finds these toys that nobodys buying and nobodys playing 
with said jodi levin of toy manufacturers of america 
swartz said the toys he listed were bought within the past six 
weeks but one company said its toy that made the list the x15 
rocket plane hasnt been manufactured for three years 
we werent selling enough of them said joe distefano vice 
president of estes industries all of the companys remaining 
rockets are used as a safe hobby and a safe science instrument 
distefano said 
swartz cited two toys that replicate implements of destruction 
in the popular horror movies a nightmare of elm street and 
friday the 13th 
he said the freddy krueger gloves with plastic simulated knives 
for fingernails come in a package bearing a warning in small 
letters do not wave poke or jab this glove at anybodys face 
eyes ears or nose 
swartz list included addresses for some of the toys 
manufacturers but not for the freddy krueger gloves maker marty 
toy inc

weapons he singled out the butcher knife and meat cleaver set 
by 1989 rubies costume co for which he also listed no address 
they are made out of rigid plastic realistic in size and 
appearance and when used in play could cause eye or other physical 
injury swartz said 
swartz said removable ribbons and elastic bands on the kid 
sister doll by playskool inc a subsidiary of hasbro inc could 
be swallowed by infants and he said playskools dressing pretty 
bride play clothes are made with flammable lace ruffles and a 
flammable veil 
wayne charness spokesman for hasbro in pawtucket ri said 
the federal government does not list ribbons and elastic bands as 
small parts and he said the bridal dress exceeds all federal and 
state regulations on flammability 
our number one concern is the safety of children who use our 
products we go out of our way to ensure everything we produce is 
safe charness said 
swartz also cited play gum cigarettes by philadelphia chewing 
gum corp in havertown pa company officials failed to return a 
telephone call requesting comment

with use and could be swallowed 
hal kyle corporate counsel for the toys manufacturer applause 
of woodland hills calif maintained that the companys products 
are safe 
we make every effort to ensure every product complies with 
certain mandated federal regulations he said 
but kyle said swartzs list has its benefits 
pretty much everyone in the industry at one point or another 
has been put on that type of a list we think its healthy it 
makes the industry focus on product safety

prague czechoslovakia authorities announced the lifting of 
travel restrictions this week then began to show a hint of 
tolerance for dissent a street protest went off unperturbed and a 
critic got a suspended sentence 
about 1000 people protested plans for a highway through 
downtown prague wednesday with a march in the capital that police 
did not move to break up 
they did prevent protesters from marching to government 
headquarters but their restraint was a departure from brutal 
tactics of the past 
helmeted riot police have routinely beaten and arrested people 
who stage demonstrations most recently on oct 28 when 
antigovernment protesters in prague sought to mark the anniversary 
of the countrys 1918 independence 
on wednesday a court in bratislava sentenced opposition 
activist miroslav kusy to an eightmonth suspended sentence and 
acquitted three others the activists had signed a statement urging 
slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1968 soviet invasion 
that crushed reforms 
in the past kusy would almost certainly have been jailed 
on tuesday premier ladislav adamec announced that czechoslovaks 
wishing to travel to the west will no longer need exit visas 
beginning jan 1 
in todays editions the new york times quoted communist party 
officials as saying the soviet union had warned czechoslovakia last 
week that further stalling on political reforms that have overtaken 
other east bloc countries could cause serious trouble 
the newspaper said moscow had cautioned prague in a highlevel 
message not to make the same mistakes as communist hardliners 
elsewhere 
the message cited east germany which opened its borders a week 
ago under the pressure of a peaceful popular revolt that began the 
october weekend that mikhail s gorbachev visited to mark the 40th 
anniversary of the communist state and encouraged the countrys 
communist leaders to get in step 
a senior adviser to one czech minister said the message was 
similar to one sent to bulgaria that apparently helped persuade 
todor i zhivkov that it was time to retire after 35 years in 
power according to the times 
in 1968 soviet tanks and troops led a warsaw pact invasion that 
ousted the czechoslovakian government of alexander dubcek when it 
tried to effect democratic reforms in what became known as the 
prague spring 
now the soviet union is leading a wave of reform among east bloc 
states poland and hungary have followed moscows lead 
czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania have resisted however 
up to 1000 people took part in the rally wednesday near 
pragues old town square they protested plans to build a 
superhighway through the stromovka park pragues largest so far 
458 people have signed a petition seeking a referendum on the issue 
the demonstrators divided into two groups with one marching 
toward the romanian embassy to protest that countrys move a year 
ago to crush a demonstration by workers in brasov romanias 
secondlargest city 
a larger group sought to cross charles bridge to reach buildings 
housing the national government lines of police many in riot 
gear blocked the other side of the bridge there was no violence 
some of the protesters sat down lighted candles and sang we 
shall overcome the crowd then rose to sing the national anthem 
the riot police left a short time later there were some shouts 
from the crowd including we want a new government and 
germany germany an apparent reference to the dramatic changes 
in east germany 
the remaining police began to move and the crowd walked back 
across the bridge again singing the national anthem 
more police moved in when the crowd surged toward the old town 
square shouting czechs come with us 
you should protect us they shouted at police a small group 
of demonstrators baited police and three were taken away 
the demonstration was peaceful although toward the end officers 
pushed some of the protesters who then gradually dispersed 
a much larger demonstration was expected friday to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the first czech uprising against the nazi occupation

beaujolais nouveau fresh from the cask vied with 
coffee and croissants in cafes this morning as bon vivants raced to 
get their first taste of what forecasters hope will be the best 
year for french wine in decades 
dont drink too much of that stuff or we wont see you for 
lunch a waiter joked with an early morning tippler at the val 
dor wine bar near the champs elysee its a lot more alcoholic 
this year 
proprietor marcelle rongier said the val dor sold its first 
bottle of the newly arrived beaujolais nouveau to a regular 
customer just after opening at 7 am 
hes taking it to work mrs rongier said and he said 
hed come back for lunch and then back again after he gets off 
a consumption embargo on the young wine the first to be 
consumed en masse since the autumn grape harvest was lifted at 
midnight wednesday promoters called the 1989 stock the best in 25 
years 
this is an exceptional year for beaujolais and all the 
vintages in france said michel deflache of the beaujolais 
winegrowers association its more of a complete wine this year 
wine lovers await the arrival of the fruity beverage each 
november at bars and parties from paris to australia planes 
trains trucks and ships transported cases all over the world this 
week so imbibers could enjoy their first glass today 
the export success is largely due to deflaches organization 
the union interprofessionnelle des vins du beaujolais critics and 
admirers have debated the wines other merits for years 
its extraordinary marketing but not extraordinary wine 
declared jacques constant 49 who chose coffee instead of 
beaujolais for breakfast at the bar st philippe in the fashionable 
faubourg st honore shopping district 
twenty years ago this wine was nothing and its still 
nothing constant pronounced the real french wines are the 
bordeaux and bourgogne 
bar owner rene bourel launched a spirited response i prefer 
the beaujolais to the bordeaux why its like a blond woman or a 
brunette a matter of taste but i find bordeaux disgusting 
outdoor parties in the crisp november air were planned all over 
the french capital this afternoon with the largest expected to be 
on the ile de la cite featuring a new orleans jazz band and a 
banquet of cheeses 
prognosticators look to this years beaujolais as a bellwether 
for the muchhyped 1989 vintages 
a long dry summer and early rainfree harvest have led to 
expectations that this years french wines could rank among the 
best this century made of balanced grapes with minimal acidity 
that gives the beaujolais nouveau normally considered an 
inexpensive lightweight by connoisseurs a greater role this year 
and wholesale price increases of 30 percent over last year point 
the overall trend in the french wine market thanks to the vaunted 
harvest deflache says 
about half of this years production of 44 million cases of 
beaujolais nouveau went to foreign markets principally west 
germany britain belgium the united states and japan 
the japanese market remains the fastestgrowing deflache said 
with demand jumping from 300000 cases in 1988 to 440000 cases 
this year 
the us market represents an equivalent number of sales and 
celebrations were planned today in new york los angeles 
pittsburgh atlanta san francisco houston and dallas

pope john paul ii has pledged church support 
for aids victims but says people at risk because of sexual 
practices must not resort to morally illicit means of 
prevention an apparent reference to condoms 
the church is concerned not only with stating a series of 
nos to particular behavior patterns but above all with 
proposing a completely meaningful lifestyle for the person he 
said wednesday in the closing address of a threeday vatican 
conference on aids 
the popes speech constituted his most extensive comments to 
date on what he called the impending plague of aids 
john paul spoke hours after an american doctor said about 1500 
us military personnel contract the aids virus every year and that 
the disease will become the leading cause of death in the us 
armed forces 
it is morally illicit to support as aids prevention any method 
which violates the authentically human sense of sexuality the 
pope said speaking in italian before the assembly of more than 
1000 scientists theologians church officials and healthcare 
workers 
while he did not mention condoms church officials said it was 
clear he was ruling out their use as a means of curbing the spread 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome that position was expressed 
repeatedly by speakers during the conference 
the church opposes all forms of artificial birth control 
in another apparent reference to condoms the pope condemned 
aids prevention based on egoistic interests deriving from 
considerations that are incompatible with the fundamental values of 
life and love 
john paul has in the past expressed his solidarity with those 
suffering from the deadly disease but the pontiff for the first 
time wednesday addressed the causes of aids and related sexual 
issues 
some church and vatican officials at the conference specifically 
condemned sexual activity among homosexuals but the pope spoke in 
more general terms 
he noted that aids can often be attributed to the phenomena of 
drug addiction and the abuse of sexuality 
the necessary prevention against the aids threat is not to be 
found in fear but rather in the conscious choice of a healthy 
free and responsible lifestyle he said 
lt col robert redfield chief of aids research at the walter 
reed army institute of research said between 200 and 500 us 
military personnel have died from the disease in the past six years 
and more than 5000 have the virus 
redfield said 1500 people in the three branches of the us 
armed forces contract the hiv virus annually 
assuming that most of those with the virus will die in eight to 
12 years aids can be considered the single leading cause of 
mortality in the military surpassing automobile accidents and any 
other medical illness combined reed said about 700 military 
personnel die each year in car accidents he said 
in the army he said one of every 500 men and one of every 
1000 women has the aids virus 
he did not say how the sufferers had contracted the aids virus 
which is most commonly transmitted through intimate sexual contact 
intravenous needles and the exchange of blood more than 40 percent 
of the infected army personnel are married redfield said 
the dissent that emerged tuesday about the tone and structure of 
the aids conference flared again wednesday 
in a stormy meeting conference chairman archbishop fiorenzo 
angelinia told about 50 delegates why he had refused a request to 
allow peter larkin an aids sufferer from london to address the 
conference 
angelini said there was no time to add larkin to the program 
that the request was made in a provocative way and that the 
conference was for aids sufferers not of them 
larkin 34 stormed out of the room saying this man is a 
disgrace to his cloth 
he later returned and apologized and angelini invited him to 
greet the pope personally later wednesday 
angelini also agreed to publish the dissident groups views in a 
church magazine report on the conference

ruby the elephant can paint but can she 
differentiate between colors 
the phoenix zoo with help from researchers at several 
universities have started testing ruby to find out 
the 16yearold pachyderm received her first paintbrush two 
years ago when her keepers noticed she spent a lot of time using 
rocks and sticks to doodle in the sand before long painting had 
become a favored reward for successfully completing her regular 
obedience training 
all we have to do is say the word paint and she squeals 
said keeper tawny carlson 
zoo officials noticed ruby seems to choose the color of her 
paint based on colors worn by her visitors on days guests wear 
red the officials said she tends to paint red yellow came into 
vogue when large earthmoving equipment worked on a nearby 
construction project 
color vision has only been documented in primates if we can 
document this it will be something new for elephants said zoo 
keeper anita schanberger 
its not a trivial question to answer said chris murphy a 
veterinary ophthalmologist with the medical school at the 
university of california davis it sounds trivial but you cant 
just hold out red and blue plastic blocks and then say that proves 
it 
murphy and colleagues at californiadavis along with experts at 
cornell university arizona state university and the university of 
arizona have coached zoo personnel on how to conduct the color 
testing zoo spokesman dick george said wednesday 
zookeepers have developed a plywood testing device that will 
eventually be used to test for color discrimination but first ruby 
must master the mechanics of the machine which involves pulling a 
lever for a food reward george said the testing could take several 
years

renos most prominent painted lady an 18foot 
showgirl statue has been ordered down from her perch after 
welcoming visitors with open arms and a champagne toast since the 
1950s 
depicted for years on postcards of the gambling citys downtown 
the scantily clad primadonna lady is the only survivor among nine 
longlegged statue showgirls that for three decades towered above 
the old primadonna hotelcasino 
in 1984 the primadonna lady paint chipping on her red 
strapless costume her tired eyes and her hairdo below her 
feathered hat was moved from downtown to the roof of a proposed 
burlesque dance club 
but the club never opened and now city officials want the 
statue removed they cite city ordinances barring closed businesses 
from retaining signs advertising the enterprise 
mike mitchell a supervisor in the citys building department 
said wednesday he was responding to a complaint in ordering the 
buildings owners to take the statue down within 10 days 
i guess this is a personal thing for a lot of people 
mitchell said shes been around a long time i do have empathy 
for her but that doesnt have any bearing on why she has to come 
down 
mark de la fuente a member of the board of would corp which 
owns the wouldbe burlesque and an adult bookstore next door said 
city officials are harassing his company 
its funny in a state like this but they dont seem to like 
our kind of business much he said licensed brothels are legal 
in most nevada counties

worshippers celebrated the death of the 
berlin wall during services at westminster college where winston 
churchill gave his famous warning of an iron curtain descending 
across europe more than four decades ago 
if sir winston leonard spencer churchill were among us this 
day he would be smiling said the rev william young chaplain 
at the college because this is the dawn of a new era one which 
he longed to see and which his wise leadership helped to create 
wednesday evenings service was promoted as a worship of thanks 
for new freedom in east germany where easing of travel 
restrictions in the last week allowed thousands to go west for the 
first time since 1961 
we are here to celebrate the death of an inanimate object a 
wall yet that wall has come to symbolize all that has kept us 
apart said jack rogers executive director of ecumenical 
ministries of callaway county 
in a march 5 1946 lecture at westminster churchill out of 
government but introduced as an honored visitor by president truman 
chillingly predicted the separation of europe 
from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron 
curtain has descended across the continent churchill said 
behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of 
central and eastern europe 
churchill who died in 1965 never claimed authorship of the 
phrase which he had used before in writing but the speech was 
indelibly etched in history books 
young noted that churchill also urged in his speech that england 
and the united states work together in building a temple of 
peace 
in an age known as the cold war peace has seemed precarious 
the iron curtain has remained firm young said 
however in just the past few years the past few months the 
past few weeks even in the past few days the winds of change have 
been blowing so strongly across the soviet union and eastern europe 
that his dream now seems not only possible but likely the iron 
curtain is being lifted dare we hope that a firm foundation for 
sir winstons temple of peace has finally been laid 
the service was filmed by the british broadcasting corp for a 
documentary about churchill that will air in the united states in 
1991 said executive producer jeremy bennett

ringo starr sang aint that a shame on a 1987 
recording date but the records producer might have felt like 
singing it in court when a judge sided with the former beatle and 
blocked the albums release 
starr said he and other musicians were drunk or on dope for much 
of the recording session and that release of the album would have 
harmed his musical reputation 
starr wore a black suit with turnedup collar dark glasses one 
dangling earring and two rings on each hand to his court date 
wednesday he testified for about an hour before leaving with his 
wife barbara bach without greeting fans waiting outside 
starrs appearance in fulton county superior court drew a steady 
stream of courthouse employees into the trial room 
the former beatle drummer sued memphis tenn record producer 
chips moman to block the 1987 recordings on which moman claims he 
spent 146000 to produce 
moman whose college park gabased record company also is 
named in the lawsuit claims to have a financial stake in starrs 
next two albums and the trials consideration of financial matters 
was expected to continue through friday 
judge clarence cooper granted a permanent injunction to block 
the album before testimony even began wednesday 
starr testified that he entered the memphis recording session 
thinking he and moman did not have a formal agreement he said any 
money or deals for further recording were contingent on whether the 
1987 album was completed and released and on whether it was a hit 
if the album we were making was a hit then chips did not want 
to be left in the cold when i made the next one starr added i 
understood that 
but moman testified that he and starr agreed to an exclusive 
threealbum deal 
starr said he drank heavily during the sessions and only sang 
never playing the drums 
three musicians who worked on the sessions however testified 
that they never witnessed any alcohol consumed during the 
recording drummer gene chrisman said starr declined invitations to 
play the drums on some songs 
momans attorneys have said starr came to the producer in an 
attempt to revive his waning music career though acknowledging he 
had not had a hit record in several years starr testified he was 
not desperate when he first talked with moman 
it was just a move for your career he said i wasnt 
looking for chips and chips probably wasnt looking for me 
moman said bob dylan made a guest vocal appearance on one song 
on the neverreleased album which includes cover versions of the 
songs i can help and aint that a shame

the national council of churches is making a 
push to strengthen ties with roman catholics and conservative 
evangelicals traditionally on the sidelines of americas largest 
ecumenical body 
it is one of the more pressing matters facing the council in the 
1990s according to members of the councils governing board who 
are gathered in pittsburgh this week for their twiceyearly meeting 
if the wall can come down in germany anything can happen but 
my assumption would be that we would form a new council if roman 
catholics and evangelicals assumed a more active role said the 
rev patricia mcclurg outgoing council president 
the roman catholic church in membership is larger than all the 
rest of us here put together she said and so in fairness to 
the way they would approach such a council the gifts they would 
bring i believe we would have to draw a new blueprint 
ms mcclurg associate executive of the presbytery mission in 
elizabeth nj told the governing board wednesday a committee has 
been appointed to increase council input from roman catholics and 
evangelicals although the two groups currently are represented on 
some council projects neither is a fullfledged member 
the rev eileen w lindner a presbyterian minister from 
tenafly nj and an associate general secretary for the council 
said the sevenmember committee will explore the ways in which 
were already witnessing christian unity with roman catholics and 
evangelicals 
thirtytwo protestant orthodox and anglican denominations 
constitute the council with a combined membership of 42 million 
christians 
some conservative evangelicals have criticized the council in 
the past for its involvement in so many social issues according to 
the very rev leonid kishkovsky an archpriest of the orthodox 
church in america who will be installed tonight as the councils 
new president 
some evangelical people would feel that more prayer is 
needed kishkovsky said 
many of the resolutions being considered by the 273member 
governing board during its threeday meeting in pittsburgh which 
ends friday involve domestic issues one measure calls for a 
congressional hearing to discuss the harassment of black elected 
officials while another urges legislation banning the sale of 
handguns and assault weapons to the public 
other resolutions being voted on by the board today call for 
continued support of affirmative action and equal pay for work of 
equal value 
on international issues the councils division of overseas 
ministries is urging the us government to prevent the return to

after a rocky fundraising effort backers say 
they have the money to break ground next year for a national rock 
n roll hall of fame and museum in downtown cleveland 
we are off the rocks and on a roll cleveland mayor george 
voinovich said at a news conference announcing the city had met the 
wednesday deadline to raise 40 million for the glassandsteel 
pyramid structure with 18story tower 
the rock and roll hall of fame foundation in new york a group 
of recording industry executives and artists promoters and 
managers which each year since 1986 has inducted music figures into 
the hall had set the deadline 
the rock mecca is expected to cost 48 million overall the city 
still must find the other 8 million no deadline for that amount 
has been announced 
the hall would be a centerpiece for a new hotelretail complex 
called tower city which is under construction 
larry thompson the halls director said 402 million was 
raised by tuesday night contributions and pledges came from 
corporations foundations government and others 
of the 40 million 5 million comes from a state appropriation 
5 million from county bonds and 18 million from city property 
taxes on tower city that would be used toward the rock halls 
construction 
the rest came in commitments by cleveland corporations and 
foundations as well as in personal gifts said thompson 
last month a 69 million federal urban development action 
grant considered a key piece in the projects funding fell 
through 
local promoters predicted about 600000 people would visit the 
hall and museum each year and spend about 85 million at area 
hotels restaurants and shops

researchers said today they have found evidence 
of mysterious ozone destruction near antarctica that cannot be 
explained by the wellknown ozone hole there 
the finding suggests that scientists have more to learn about 
the important problem of what destroys ozone in the atmosphere 
said researcher mh proffitt 
reporting in the british journal nature the scientists said 
they had detected ozone losses outside the ozone hole which is an 
area of annual and temporary ozone destruction over antarctica 
they also found evidence that ozone losses begin before the hole 
forms each year 
other scientists urged caution in interpreting the research but 
said it is potentially significant 
ozone is a form of oxygen it is a pollutant at ground level but 
beneficial high in the atmosphere where it shields out ultraviolet 
rays that can promote skin cancer 
protection of the globes ozone shield has become a focus of 
international concern focusing on the use of compounds called 
chlorofluorocarbons chlorine from those compounds is implicated in 
the ozone hole 
the new studys coauthors include proffitt of the cooperative 
institute for research in environmental sciences a joint venture 
of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the 
university of colorado the other coauthors are with noaa 
the scientists found evidence of ozone destruction at altitudes 
of about 11 miles to 12 miles by analyzing readings taken during 
airplane flights during 1987 
in an unusual approach to measuring ozone losses the 
researchers first determined an apparently normal minimum ratio of 
ozone levels to amounts of nitrogen compounds when a given sample 
of air showed a lower ratio it was considered to have lost some 
ozone 
using this method the researchers found evidence of ozone loss 
averaging at least 15 percent to 30 percent at the 11mile altitude 
outside the ozone hole the limits of which roughly correspond to 
the outline of antarctica 
the newly found area of depletion extended about 342 miles 
outside the boundary of the ozone hole and perhaps twice that far 
proffitt said in a telephone interview 
in addition losses inside and outside the area covered by the 
ozone hole were observed in midaugust which was before the 
formation of the hole in september 
the researchers concluded that losses outside the ozone hole 
were caused by some sort of chemical reaction that occurred outside 
the hole perhaps they resulted from temporary conditions that 
allowed chlorine to destroy ozone for limited periods proffitt 
said 
robert de zafra of the state university of new york at stony 
brook who has studied the chemistry of the ozone hole said 
wednesday he found the papers evidence interesting but not 
compelling 
he cautioned that the researchers used only an indirect means of 
detecting ozone loss an aberration similar to what they called 
evidence of ozone loss near the ozone hole also appears in their 
data from the northern hemisphere but they do not claim ozone loss 
there he said 
still if their analysis near the ozone hole holds up and is 
verified by other more direct measurements then this is a fairly 
major and significant finding that will send people scurrying to 
try to determine the cause of it he said 
guy brasseur acting director of the atmospheric chemistry 
division at the national center for atmospheric research in 
boulder colo also cautioned the papers conclusions should be 
considered only tentative 
the paper gives good evidence for ozone destruction but not 
absolute proof he said

a lesbian couple who adopted a boy with 
aids charged that california and other states were wasting 
taxpayers money and ignoring the welfare of children by forbidding 
adoptions by unmarried people 
the couple millie jessen and sue pavlik held a news conference 
at the national center for lesbian rights on wednesday with their 
2yearold son eric to comment on the lengthy battle required to 
legalize his adoption 
an judge in june allowed the adoption to proceed and it became 
final in july 
but attorney roberta achtenberg said there were many cases in 
the country in which couples qualified to care for orphans were not 
permitted to do so 
the lesbian rights center has represented about a half dozen 
unmarried couples across the country who have won adoption battles 
she said the issue is not a gay or straight one 
millie and sues marital status does not determine their 
parenting abilities achtenberg said 
achtenberg said courts should look at childrens welfare 
foremost rather than adhering to guidelines of the state social 
services department which is oriented to promote traditional 
marriage she said 
during the news conference eric sat on pavliks lap playing 
with batman figures part of the time sometimes getting up to 
toddle around the office chasing a golf ball while mugging for 
cameras and calling out mommy mommy 
jessen said im mommy shes pavlik mama and its 
really cute when he says mommy mama when he wants both of us 
jessen and pavlik said they were welcomed when they offered 
their home for foster care of children testing positive for the hiv 
virus which causes aids they took eric home from the hospital 
when he was just 5 weeks old but met with resistance several 
months later when they asked to adopt the boy 
although social service officials recognized that jessen and 
pavlik offered eric a stable and nuturing home nobody wanted to 
be the bad guy in this case so they sat on it achtenberg 
said 
it took nine months for the necessary documents and reports to 
be filed with the court a matter that could have been decided in 
6 weeks achtenberg said 
achtenberg said she believes the case will make it easier for 
other judges to rule in favor of unmarried couples seeking adoption 
and may step up political pressure to change the policy against 
adoption by the unmarried 
jessen and pavlik said they were ecstatic about winning legal 
recognition as erics adoptive parents although they feel strong 
parental bonds to the boy jessen said as partners for the past 
five years it was important to have the relationship validated 
officially rather to be treated as secondclass citizens 
the court ruled jessen and pavlik to be erics adoptive parents 
with both guaranteeing his care and support erics mother is dead 
his natural father gave the women his blessing saying he would be 
unable to provide the special medical care the boy will need 
because of aids achtenberg said 
jessen a computer programmer and pavlik a homemaker said 
they became interested in becoming foster parents for children with 
aids after taking a course in helping people with the deadly 
disease 
both women describe eric as a healthy and normal right now 
although he was born 8 to 10 weeks premature and didnt catch up 
developmentally until he turned two last january he suffered a 
bacterial blood infection related to aids they said 
the boy takes azt and participates in a study on the benefits of 
gamma globulin in treating aids 
he has aids but right now hes doing very well pavlik said

dont tell it to the marines 
theres a lot of plot maybe too much in a few good men an 
overstuffed and not entirely convincing military courtroom drama 
that opened wednesday at broadways music box theatre 
playwright aaron sorkin has packed more than 60 scenes and 20 
actors into his nearly threehour examination of what happened to a 
young marine at the united states naval base in guantanamo bay 
cuba 
some of the evening is entertaining thanks to the authors 
snappy often funny dialogue the jokes help camouflage the plays 
dramatic shortcomings particularly its meager attempts to flesh 
out the personal life of the main character and a confusing 
disappointing courtroom finale but the laughs also get in the way 
and finally trivialize the serious story sorkin is trying to tell 
the play marks the broadway debut of the 28yearold sorkin and 
of director don scardino who has made a name for himself as an 
actor and as a director of televisions the days and nights of 
molly dodd 
its hero is a wisecracking navy lawyer named daniel kaffee 
played with a great deal of charm and humor by tom hulce kaffee is 
assigned to defend two marines charged with murdering a third 
soldier the dead marine pfc william santiago was disliked for 
being a malingerer trying to get out of the corps and writing 
letters of complaint to his senator 
santiago was the victim of a code red a marine term for a 
brutal form of hazing the two men on trial for his death are 
willing to take the punishment for what happened but kaffee with 
the help of two other defense lawyers played by megan gallagher 
and mark nelson are determined to prove a coverup 
they run up against the abrasive supermacho guantanamo marine 
commander lt col nathan jessep played by a grinning stephen 
lang lang gives a maniacal overthetop performance that gets 
more cartoonish as the evening goes on 
hulce gets uneven support from the other cast members a 
sadfaced mark nelson brings intelligence and a sly sense of fun to 
the role of hulces nebbish assistant while a bland gallagher has 
the impossible task of playing his other more gungho partner 
both of the roles only pad the plot 
much better is a lowkeyed clark gregg as hulces formidable 
opponent and victor love and michael dolan are ramrod perfection 
as the two accused marines several other cameos fall flat 
particularly ted marcoux as a biblethumping officer and geoffrey 
nauffts as a hayseed marine who takes the witness stand 
scardino hasnt just directed the play he has choreographed it 
scenes blend quickly into each other on designer ben edwards 
simple twotiered platform set with a ghostly sentry tower standing 
guard over the back of the stage its a fine job 
but someone should have sent sorkin back to cut the play the 
wait for the minimal dramatic payoff is long and even when it 
comes several issues particularly the death of santiago remain 
unresolved 
a few good men already has been sold to the movies and tom 
cruise is reportedly interested in the script maybe by the time it 
begins filming sorkin will have streamlined the play but whats 
on stage now at the music box looks and sounds like a long night of 
one playwrights basic training 
howard kissel wrote in todays editions of the daily news that 
sorkin skillfully built his story with strong confrontations and 
sharp banter but kissel wondered what is this really about 
the new york times frank rich said the play was too predictable 
and attempts to tie it to larger moral issues were lightweight 
clive barnes of the new york post applauded sorkin for writing 
an oldfashioned strickly commercial melodrama that provides 
an evening of sheer delight unadultered by the need for serious 
thought uncomplicated by consideration of higher dramatic 
sensibility 
noting trial plays are clearly set up and conclude neatly linda 
winer of new york newsday said people who like courtroom dramas 
will be thrilled with good men but she called for something 
more substantial to hang on to than a mechanical genre with its 
bolts showing

a former court secretary says she felt 
insulted after she saw a judge wearing nothing but his undershorts 
when he called her into in his office six years ago 
betty krisko 58 told a jury wednesday she yelled an epithet at 
suspended judge joseph f okicki before stalking out of his office 
that day 
okicki 59 who sat on the bench for 17 years before being 
suspended last year is on trial on 11 charges spanning more than a 
decade he has denied the charges which include bribery 
extortion open lewdness and coercion 
he was standing sideways 10 to 12 feet away dictating into 
the dictaphone betty krisko said testifying on the april 1983 
episode he had nothing on but a pair of bikini briefs she 
said 
i was disgusted and embarrassed 
okicki appeared to be naked when he called the former secretary 
into his office on another occasion in july 1983 said ms krisco 
who worked for the judge for 12 years before leaving in february 
1985 
under crossexamination by defense attorney richard galloway 
ms krisko said she could see only okickis chest area and could 
not tell whether he was wearing pants 
she also testified that although her relationship with the judge 
was good at one point in later years okicki often harassed her 
and appeared to be trying to get rid of her 
he gave me so many problems at work she said he 
locked me out of the office and threw files off my desk 
earlier wednesday defense attorneys questioned the credibility 
of a former tipstaff who said he often drove okickis daughters to 
college or performed chores around the judges house on county time 
george koban a former philadelphia police officer who left the 
force in 1972 because of a disability said he paid okicki 500 
for a betterpaying job but never received it 
a tipstaff takes care of the jury and keeps the courtroom in 
order 
defense attorneys wednesday presented kobans bank records from 
that time saying they did not reflect a 500 withdrawal 
okickis trial began nov 7 and is expected to last at least 
three weeks he faces a second trial on 16 other counts at a still 
unscheduled date

the state transport company 
today fired hundreds of striking black workers and police 
headquarters said six officers were hurt in two clashes with 
clubwielding strikers 
strikes against south african transport services are illegal 
because its rail trucking and harbor operations are designated as 
essential 
the company fired 626 workers earlier this week and said more 
than 800 others were being fired today 
police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway station 
in germiston near johannesburg when about 50 strikers arrived by 
train for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares 
officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked with 
sticks whips and stones police said strikers scattered after 
officers fired two pistol shots according to police who said 
three officers were injured 
an hour later three more officers were hurt trying to disperse 
about 150 strikers outside a union office in germiston according 
to police headquarters no arrests were reported in either incident 
the dispute centers on a demand by the south african railwyas 
and harbor workers for the minimum wage to be increased to 570 a 
month from 230 other issues in dispute are the unions objection 
to possible privatization and the companys refusal to officially 
recognize the union 
most of the strikers are in the johannesburgpretoria area and 
the port city of durban 
the union which says 40000 workers are striking is affiliated 
to the congress of south african trade unions the countrys 
largest and most militantly antiapartheid labor federation 
the union claims a membership of 40000 of the total 180000 
black workers employed by the transport company 
the transport strike is one of two bitter nationwide labor 
disputes that show no signs of resolution 
about 6000 black employees of south african breweries the 
countrys privately owned beer monopoly have been on strike for 
five weeks 
on wednesday the brewery workers union lowered its wage demand 
for the first time saying it would accept a 32 percent increase 
instead of a 38 percent increase but management maintained its 
refusal to change its final offer of a 16 percent raise 
seven deaths have been linked to the strike 
police officials also said today that 15 black activists had 
been arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in alexandra 
a township adjoining johannesburg the meeting followed the 
announcement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission for 
a protest march in alexandra on saturday 
organizers hoped 30000 would join the march to demand new 
housing an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accrued 
during a threeyear rent boycott

international business machines corp has 
acknowledged that it sold the federal government used equipment it 
had claimed was new a published report said today 
ibm spokesman mark holcomb told the washington times that the 
company also falsely certified that equipment sold to the 
government was made of domestic parts in accordance with the buy 
american act 
holcomb said ibm has been trying to negotiate a settlement with 
the general services administration the government agency that has 
been investigating ibm computer contracts 
eighteen months ago ibm discovered through its own internal 
audit procedure and disclosed to the government contract compliance 
related to the buy american act and the newversusused issue 
holcomb told the newspaper 
he said the false certifications may have begun as early as 1982 
but that the gsa was investigating ibm shipments from 1986 to 1988 
a finding that ibm gave false information could lead the federal 
government to suspend one of its biggest computer contractors from 
doing business with the government 
ibm provides computer mainframes and support services to the 
federal government the gsa told the times that ibm received 84 
percent of navy contracts for ibm or ibmcompatible mainframes 
a justice department spokesman dan eramian declined to say 
whether the department is investigating ibm the times said 
holcomb said ibm has acted to correct the problems and said the 
false certifications were not made intentionally 
its a matter of not knowing as the result of an 
administration problem not knowing the content ibm has corrected 
the problem it no longer exists he said

doctors shouldnt send patients to a clinic for 
expensive tests if they own a stake in the clinic unless they 
advise the patient to get a second opinion first a law professor 
argues in a medical journal article 
the attorney marc a rodwin of tufts university said it is not 
enough for doctors simply to tell patients about the conflict of 
interest because patients may not understand why it matters 
many doctors now own shares in xray centers and other 
facilities where they frequently send patients for tests or other 
services 
patients need to know that virtually every major study 
indicates that physicians who make referrals to medical facilities 
they own recommend more or more expensive medical tests and 
procedures than physicians without ownership interests rodwin 
wrote 
rodwin outlined his case in a report published today in the new 
england journal of medicine 
conflict of interest can affect a doctors views about whether a 
medical service is needed not just who should provide it rodwin 
said 
rather than simply telling patients about their conflict or 
giving them a list of alternative clinics physicians who 
recommend expensive tests or procedures in facilities in which they 
have a financial interest should probably advise their patients to 
seek a second opinion from a physician without a conflict of 
interest

occhetto is hoping the change will reverse the partys sagging 
political fortunes and end the stigma that has kept it out of the 
national government for 42 years 
it is a gamble that could change the political map in a country 
where one party the christian democrats has led or dominated all 
governments since the end of world war ii 
divisions among leftists have caused the permanent victory of 
the christian democrats occhetto said wednesday 
but the move could also backfire and cost the communist party 
its hardcore supporters lead to a split in party ranks and 
strengthen the christian democrats no 1 position 
the step taken by achille occhetto has unquestionable 
historical importance and like all moves of such nature carries 
risks firstly that of losing somebody and something along the 
way said turins moderate la stampa newspaper in a frontpage 
commentary 
in recent elections the communists have held on to their no 2 
position but have dropped from the 34 percent of the vote they 
received in 1976 when they came to the brink of power to around 
27 percent in the meantime claimed membership has fallen from 
some 2 million in 1953 to less than 15 million 
still in a europe that has seen ruling soviet bloc communist 
parties begin to crumble and the once powerful french party reduced 
to a small opposition role italys communists stand out as major 
votegetters 
the party has long pledged adherence to western parliamentary 
democracy criticized moscows military intervention in 
czechoslovakia in 1968 and afghanistan in 1979 and voiced its 
support for italys membership in nato 
successive us administrations however have opposed the 
partys participation in italian government expressing wariness 
over its stand on strategic issues 
the party opposed the installation of cruise nuclear missiles in 
italy in a nato initiative to counter a soviet missile buildup and 
the transfer to italy of a squadron of us fighterbombers forced 
to leave spain 
italian news agencies quoted us ambassador peter secchia as 
telling reporters during a visit to bolgona on wednesday that 
changes are always welcome but that the proposed change of name 
was an issue for the party and not the us administration 
occhetto made his formal proposal to a meeting of his partys 
leadership on tuesday saying the party had to keep up with the 
changes taking place in europe or risk losing its special 
identity 
in other words there is no more political mileage for a party 
that presents itself as a critic of international communism if 
international communism fades away 
occhettos aim is to lure the smaller socialist party and other 
leftist groups under one political banner presenting itself as an 
alternative to the christian democrats 
but the socialists have been coalition partners of the christian 
democats for the past decade and it seems doubtful that party 
leader bettino craxi would ally himself with another leftist party 
that receives twice as many votes 
craxis long march strategy has been aimed at eventually 
overtaking the communists to secure him leadership of the italian 
left 
occhettos plan will be considered by the 300member central 
committee in the coming days and then probably submitted to an 
extraordinary congress for approval next year perhaps before 
spring municipal elections 
occhetto said it was premature to come up with the new name but 
party leaders have discussed a number of possibilities over the 
past few months including workers party italian democratic 
party and party of the united left

doctors today transplanted the heart of an 
israeli soldier who was killed in an arab guerrilla attack into a 
palestinian patient israeli officials said 
hanna khader 54 a former hotel manager from east jerusalem 
was recovering and in stable condition in the intensive care ward 
at hadassah medical center in jerusalem after the fourhour 
operation the family said 
thirteen family members gathered in the hospital lobby 
afterward crying and hugging each other 
i cant tell you how happy i am said mary his 51yearold 
wife hes a human being and there is no difference between a 
palestinian and an israeli in such cases 
jamilla khaders 29yearold daughter said the family was not 
told by the hospital who donated the heart but learned of it from 
the media 
she indicated family members had some concern that they could be 
targeted by radical palestinians or fundamentalists for accepting 
an israeli heart but said in such cases we cannot mix politics 
with medicine 
if we refused to take the heart it would be like killing him 
with our own hands she said adding that she would do the same 
if one of her family had an organ needed by an israeli 
the israeliborn soldier reservist sgt zeev traum 40 who 
grew up in new york and lived on an israeli collective farm died 
wednesday night of a head wound suffered in an ambush monday 
traum was the second trooper to die in the attack claimed by the 
palestinian moslem fundamentalist hamas group he was the 42nd 
israeli victim of a 23monthold palestinian uprising in which 615 
arabs also have died 
spokesmen at hadassah could not be reached but an israeli 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the 
soldiers family had donated the heart to the arab patient 
the family agreed immediately to make the donation simply out 
of pure generosity but they are in mourning and dont want to talk 
about it the official said 
traums heart was brought to jerusalem in a special ice chest by 
helicopter from soroka hospital in the southern israeli town of 
beersheba shortly before midnight 
the surgery conducted by dr dov simon was the ninth heart 
transplant done in israel 
it was the first known case since the uprising began of an 
israeli victim donating an organ to a palestinian 
in december the family of a palestinian shot to death by 
israeli soldiers in the west bank town of nablus refused a request 
to donate their sons heart to a dying israeli civilian 
the palestinian nasr hawwash 20 was declared brain dead after 
sustaining a serious head wound dec 16 during a demonstration 
the israeli accountant yehiel israeli 46 had been hooked to a 
respirator on dec 18 after unsuccessful surgery on a heart valve 
he died three days later

an arson fire destroyed the home of a 
vocal supporter of a play about aids shortly before its debut in 
this conservative ozark town 
investigators believe it was related to his involvement to the 
normal heart 
it does look like there may be some connection between brad 
evans support for the play and the fire said springfield fire 
investigator kent turner 
evans 22 is president of the group people acting with 
compassion and tolerance which led an effort to produce the 
normal heart at southwest missouri state university he was 
attending an openingnight candlelight vigil outside the theater 
when the fire was reported at 7 pm wednesday turner said two 
cats died in the fire 
no other disruptions were reported after a week of 
demonstrations for and against the production at the state 
university 
it doesnt discourage me said evans but i never thought 
anything like this would happen 
there were no arrests turner said 
the back door to the singlestory house had been forced open and 
flammable liquid was found on the floors of two rooms in the house 
he said 
the normal heart written by gay activist and writer larry 
kramer is set in new york in the early 1980s the drama which 
appeared offbroadway in 1985 attacks societys slow response to 
the aids crisis 
opponents of the play including state republican rep jean 
dixon of springfield and citizens demanding standards leader paul 
summers said it promotes homosexuality they called it obscene and 
contrary to the moral standards of the community and should not be 
supported with tax money 
on wednesday night as the play opened several dozen security 
officers stood outside the theater but a lone protester peacefully 
handed out leaflets stating that the bible was against 
homosexuality 
wednesdays soldout performance capped a week of protests at the 
school

300 others at her former school in blasting opponents of the play

chancellor helmut kohl today 
criticized people who say there is little chance the two germanys 
will reunite an apparent response to mikhail s gorbachevs 
comments on the subject 
he who does not want to make decisions for our people should 
not try to persuade them the best thing is a division of our 
fatherland kohl said in his first speech to parliament on east 
germanys historic border openings 
in east germany the leader of a political party long allied 
with the ruling communists but now asserting independence said the 
communists control of the government will be challenged during a 
parliament session friday 
in another development east germanys communist party daily 
neues deutschland announced today in a frontpage report that its 
longtime chief editor had been replaced the report said the change 
occurred after the staff of the orthodox publication engaged in a 
confrontation with the past 
it said editor herbert naumann was replaced by wolfgang 
spickermann to promote change at the newspaper until now a forum 
for harsh attacks on western capitalism and even on the reforms of 
gorbachev the soviet president 
reunification has become an increasingly important topic 
following the growing unrest in communist east germany that led to 
the new government of president egon krenz and the decision to open 
the nations borders 
gorbachev on wednesday said talk about reunification would 
mean interference in the affairs of east germany and west germany 
but kohl who did not mention gorbachev said east germans 
must be able to decide for themselves which path they want to 
follow in the future 
kohl said west germany would respect every decision made by 
the people of the german democratic republic east germany in free 
selfdetermination 
the chancellor claimed socialism is a total failure a day 
earlier gorbachev insisted the communist revolution was not a 
mistake 
kohl pledged to nato and european economic community allies that 
west germany remains committed to the integration in western 
europe kohl also said solution of the german problem and the 
overcoming of europes division are inseparably linked 
during todays debate in parliament former chancellor willy 
brandt said he doesnt have the impression east germans want 
reunification soon 
apparently they see the question of free elections as the 
matter of priority said the 75yearold social democrat 
british foreign minister douglas hurd commenting on 
reunification during a visit to west berlin today said it is not 
realistic now it is not actively on the agenda it is not 
what people in the gdr east germany are pressing for hurd told 
reporters at the citys reichstag building 
krenz who is also communist party chief met with leaders of 
allied political parties and the new parliamentary speaker 
guenther maleuda to discuss the other parties call for a better 
powersharing arrangement among the recognized political groups 
the official adn news agency reporting on the meeting said the 
leadership wants a commission formed to draw all political and 
popular movements into the reform process maleuda has called for 
the creation of a multiparty government 
manfred gerlach head of east germanys liberal democractic 
party said his countrys constitutional guarantee of a leading 
role for the communist party would be challenged at fridays 
session of the increasingly independentminded parliament 
it was not known whether a vote on the change would come the 
same day 
i figure it will pass with a large majority gerlach said in 
an interview with west germanys ard radio network 
gerlach predicted free elections as early as next year and that 
the communists would fail to win a majority 
hundreds of people meanwhile waited on both sides of the 
berlin wall for a possible opening of a border crossing at the 
brandenburg gate the gate berlins bestknown landmark has 
symbolized the division of germany since the wall was built in 
1961 east berlin has opened 22 border crossings at the wall since 
lifting travel restrictions thursday and there has been wide 
speculation that an opening at the gate is next 
in response to east germans move toward reforms west german 
economics minister helmut haussmann has offered massive aid similar 
to the us marshall plan that helped rebuild warravaged western 
europe after the nazi defeat 
but the offer is conditional on fundamental changes in east 
germanys economic and political systems 
east german officials have spurned the offer saying they prefer 
their own recovery course they have made it clear that they are 
not ready to abandon their centrallyplanned economic system

house speaker thomas s foley can make use of 
an air force plane on a casebycase basis when he needs to travel 
on official government business but no air force three will be 
set aside for him 
that is the result of action taken by the house wednesday a day 
after reports that an amendment in a defense appropriations bill 
would have given foley the same reservedplane privilege now 
enjoyed only by the president and vice president 
in adopting a 286 billion military spending bill house members 
agreed to a substitute provision that would make an air force 
aircraft available to foley if he requested it but no specific 
c20 plane would be kept ready for his call at andrews air force 
base in nearby maryland 
under what has been described as a gentlemans agreement the 
defense department has traditionally furnished the speaker with a 
plane on request foley is next in line of presidential succession 
after vice president dan quayle 
when reporters asked presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
wednesday about an earlier proposal to set aside an aircraft for 
foley he said i doubt that the proposal will fly once it is 
exposed to the american peoples scrutiny 
we worked it out with the air force rep john murtha 
dpa said after the house agreement to keep the old arrangement 
murtha is chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on 
defense who according to congressional sources had inserted the 
change into the bill 
murtha said the committee had felt strongly that because of 
the speakers high responsibility and incidents of terrorism a 
plane should be designated for his use but he said we had 
trouble with the technical language 
the defense department already provides a jet for the president 
known as air force one and for the vice president dubbed air 
force two 
it remained unclear whether foley had requested a change but 
his staff seemed surprised when told it was part of the bill 
questioned at midday about the possibility of having a 20 
million aircraft at his disposal foley said there has never been a 
case where the speaker has been denied use of an aircraft for 
official purposes 
i am sure that will continue nor would i ever suppose that 
any aircraft would be assigned exclusively to me and not be 
available for other use under appropriate circumstances for 
official purposes he said

the government has declared all 
whitesonly beaches open to blacks and will repeal the law that 
allows local officials to segregate public facilities president 
fw de klerk announced today 
the time has arrived to repeal this act he said referring 
the separate amenities act that his national party put into law in 
1953 
since then the act has been used by white local governments 
across the country to bar blacks from parks libraries swimming 
pools civic centers buses and a range of other amenities 
in many communities most or all of these amenities are now 
opened to all races but whitesonly facilities persist in the 
capital pretoria in many rural towns and in several small 
industrial cities where the farright conservative party took power 
in municipal elections last year and reintroduced segregation laws 
the proposed repeal is the beginning of the end of a separate 
white community life said koos van der merwe chief spokesman 
for the conservatives who urged whites to oust de klerk 
the steps which now will inevitably follow will be the 
scrapping of separate residential areas separate schools and 
separate voters rolls he said mr de klerk is placing south 
africa on the road of a totally racially mixed south africa which 
will inevitably be governed by a black majority 
de klerk addressing a highlevel advisory group called the 
presidents council said the separate amenities act would be 
repealed as soon as possible after parliament reconvenes on 
feb 2 
the repeal would leave three major categories of segregation in 
south africa residential neighborhoods public hospitals and 
public schools 
the government is in the process of designating certain 
neighborhoods as multiracial although it says whites will retain 
the option of living in segregated areas de klerk has given no 
signal that public schools and hospitals will be integrated 
antiapartheid leaders had anticipated either repeal or revision 
of the separate amenities act and said any change while welcome 
would not affect the political domination of the 5 million whites 
over the 32 million blacks asians and people of mixedrace 
activists have demanded the repeal of the two remaining 
legislative cornerstones of apartheid the group areas act which 
segregates residential areas and the population registration act 
which officially classifies all south africans by race 
de klerk said repeal of the separate amenities act would be 
undertaken with careful consideration of the implications of such 
a step he said fitting measures would be taken to ensure 
that the opening of segregated facilities did not lead to 
overcrowding an increase in crime or environmental problems 
steps to integrate whitesonly beaches should be taken and 
implemented without any delay he said 
many beaches have been opened to all races in recent years but 
segregated beachfronts remain the countrys main resort city 
durban and several smaller resort communities durbans city 
council recently voted down a beach integration proposal 
it has been decided that all beaches will henceforth be 
accessible to all members of the public de klerk said insofar 
as ordinances or bylaws may exist in conflict with this the local 
authorities are requested to act within the spirit of this 
decision 
de klerk who took office in august said his announcements were 
in line with our stated goal to eliminate discrimination 
his announcements were the latest in a series of moves aimed at 
enhancing the prospects for blackwhite negotiations on a new 
constitution that would extend political rights to blacks while 
protecting white interests 
among these moves 
eight prominent political prisoners including seven leaders of 
the outlawed african national congress were freed unconditionally 
on oct 15 
for the first time in years the government has allowed mass 
demonstrations and marches by antiapartheid activists 
de klerk and other officials have sharply increased government 
contacts with opposition leaders holding meetings with nationally 
known and local activists 
there is no alternative for south africa but the road of 
reconciliation de klerk said today the government is not 
playing games we are in deadly earnest with regard to the road 
on which we have embarked 
he said the government had spent the equivalent of 70 million 
since 1983 upgrading beaches and would continue this program with 
the aim of minimizing overcrowding and possible racial friction he 
said local authorities would retain powers to control potential 
crowding problems 
de klerk said the the government would support 
nondiscriminatory methods to ensure acceptable behavior 
civilized standards and compliance with the law

robbed by gunmen 
he didnt say where they were robbed the relative added 
ms fahrend 54 of san francisco was with sami and the boy 
they are all ok the relative added

standing regulations said its a strange story i dont believe 
that they were held against their will

german embassy in beirut saying they could not explain why it was 
reported they were kidnapped said foreign ministry spokesman 
rainer mueller he said the three went to the embassy this morning 
and were all in good health 
they told the embassy they went there because they were upset 
about news reports of their kidnapping said mueller 
the kidnapping claim was made in a typewritten statement in 
arabic by a group calling itself the organization of just revenge 
the statement was delivered to a western news agency in beirut with 
photocopies of the passports and visas of the three people 
the organization of just revenge announces its responsibility 
for kidnapping the west german mounir sami born in lebanon and 
his son danjel sami and american publisherjournalist deborah 
fahrend in beirut for their activities in lebanon it said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater announced to

ms fahrend 54 is a nurse and sometime poet who had described 
herself as a publisherjournalist she reportedly had gone to 
wartorn lebanon in hopes of writing a book on what she called her 
chance in a lifetime 
it could not be immediately determined whether the three knew 
each other

americans held longest is terry a anderson 42 chief middle east

the navys top safety officer said he had no 
explanation for the string of 10 accidents during the past three 
weeks that prompted a standdown of all navy units 
sometimes there just is no answer capt ferguson norton 
commander of the navy safety center said wednesday never in the 
history of the modern navy have so many accidents happened at one 
time 
ten people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 71 have 
been injured in navy accidents during the past three weeks 
on tuesday secretary of the navy h lawrence garrett iii and 
adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations ordered all 
navy units to suspend normal operations and spend 48 hours of 72 
hours this week reviewing procedures and training and reminding all 
hands of safety measures 
the standdown affected such farflung outposts as the navys 
subic bay base in the philippines and the 7th fleet based in 
yokosuka japan 
basically the training has essentially stopped here at 
subic said lt cmdr kevin mukri a spokesman at the philippines 
base where 5000 sailors are stationed support of ships is 
continuing but everyone is taking the guidance safety review 
order extremely seriously 
in the sensitive persian gulf region the crews of most navy 
ships including three minesweepers were allowed to continue their 
duties and put off the safety check until time allowed a spokesman 
said 
we are always vigilant and we try to maintain the highest 
state of readiness always said joe bartlett spokesman for the 
naval force in the gulf we put emphasis on safety at all times 
norton whose command analyzes all navy accidents worldwide 
compared the order to a timeout in an athletic contest 
it gives you a chance to review your game plan and get back to 
the basics a timeout also can be called to halt the momentum of 
the opponent in this case the string of mishaps he said 
norton said the centers analysis of the accidents found no 
common denominator linking them nor any indication that budget 
cuts played any role 
on tuesday 31 people were injured in a fire aboard the 
amphibious assault ship uss inchon while it was docked at a norfolk 
repair yard 
the most serious of the recent accidents occurred oct 29 when a 
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed 
into the uss lexington in the gulf of mexico the pilot and four 
others were killed 
the destroyer uss kinkaid and a freighter collided in the 
malacca strait off indonesia killing one navy crewman injuring 
five and starting fires on both vessels saturday early sunday in 
asia 
last thursday a navy reserve pilot flying an a7e jet crashed 
into an apartment complex in smyrna ga killing two civilians and 
injuring two others including himself 
norton said the navys record of safety has been steadily 
improving according to navy figures there were 118 major 
accidents during operations in 1984 that figure has dropped to 69 
so far this year 
however the number of fatalities for 1984 was 64 102 sailors 
have been killed so far this year including 47 in the april 19 gun 
turret explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa 
standdowns have happened before in june the marine corps 
ordered all its aviation units to stop normal activities for two 
days of refresher safety training 
but norton said the current standdown is the most widespread in 
memory 
lt cmdr steve burnett a navy spokesman said atlantic fleet 
ships at sea will not be called home for the safety drill but will 
standdown at sea

diethard wietsche has gone back to east 
germany where he says he spent 10 years in prison for trying to 
escape because hes disappointed with life in the capitalist west 
he says he now has hope for promised changes in his communist 
homeland 
wietsche was one of about 60 east germans who had arrived by 
wednesday at the east berlin center where the government welcomes 
back prodigal sons and daughters 
every day about 30 people knock on the door here and ask to 
reenter the german democratic republic said peter heyn deputy 
chief of the center in berlins northeastern buch district the 
climate in the federal republic west germany has gotten colder 
he predicted the center soon would reach its capacity of 150 
people 
it is not clear how many of the east germans who fled to west 
germany this year might return home now that communist leaders in 
east berlin have opened of the borders to free travel and promised 
a more open society 
about 200000 east germans most of them young and skilled had 
emigrated to their rich western neighbor this year before the 
authorities buckled under the pressure of a peaceful popular revolt 
and threw open their borders 
west germanys zdf television network said wednesday about 7000 
disillusioned east germans were expected to turn their backs on 
their rich neighbor but officials on both sides of the border said 
there were no signs of a major organized return for the time being 
zdf gave no source for its report 
an air of oldstyle secrecy surrounds the east berlin government 
returnee center east germanys only one until the national red 
cross started setting up several of its own this week 
gray corrugatedmetal fences keep outsiders from peering in 
patrolling soldiers demand identification from anyone wanting to 
enter the eightstory building 
but heyn said we are trying everything to simplify 
procedures for regaining east german citizenship 
wietsche 33 a native east german who said he was jailed for 10 
years for trying to flee to the west said west german society 
wasnt for him 
but what made the biggest difference was the fall of erich 
honecker wietsche said the hardline east german leader who 
oversaw the construction of the berlin wall was ousted oct 18 
a car mechanic wietsche said he moved legally to the bavarian 
city of regensburg two years ago after he was released from jail 
he said he expects reforms to begin soon under egon krenz who 
replaced honecker 
a 48yearold warehouse worker who would not give his name said 
he left west germany a few days ago after four years feeling 
totally disappointed 
i was allegedly too old for a job he said it wasnt for 
me i wanted to come back mainly because of the security which i 
missed quite a bit in the federal republic 
the east german red cross which said it was preparing for a 
wave of up to 10000 people returning opened four reception 
centers along the border with west germany authorities in cities 
such as magdeburg and erfurt readied emergency shelters in military 
barracks schools and dormitories 
west german red cross officials in bonn said buses were on 
standby but no organized return was planned 
dispatches by east germanys staterun news agency adn wednesday 
suggested only a trickle of returnees had arrived at the official 
centers 
officials said the flow back to east germany would be difficult 
to document since many people would simply return to their homes 
east german officials say the government will loan each person 
who returns 150 marks or 82 in immediate aid and 15 marks or 
8 for each day of unemployment

the aflcio is enlisting perhaps the worlds 
most popular union leader lech walesa for an advertising campaign 
and is banking heavily that the polish solidarity leaders fame 
will help improve the image of us unions 
walesa wearing a union yes pin on his lapel taped a 
30second spot earlier this week when he appeared at the labor 
federations convention 
it took about 90 minutes to tape the spot because walesa speaks 
little english and the producers were not certain until wednesday 
that they would be able to cut a commercial from the tape 
most of his remarks are in polish and translated by an 
interpreter into english but the ad ends with the onetime shipyard 
electrician beaming and declaring the union yes slogan of the 
federations advertising campaign 
the ad will air for the first time tuesday night during abctvs 
situation comedy roseanne the first planned run will end the 
following saturday with an airing during the notre damemiami 
college football game 
in that fiveday period the federation will spend 600000 to 
air the ad during those two nationally televised programs as well 
as during dozens of local newscasts in major cities 
the union yes campaign to date has relied on four actors and 
actresses jack lemmon tyne daly howard hesseman and edward james 
olmos who taped ads in both english and spanish in an effort to 
attract hispanics

conservative fernando collor de 
mello led two leftwing rivals today in brazils first free 
presidential election since 1960 according to preliminary returns

collor de mello is probably headed for a runoff dec 17 against 
populist leonel brizola or rep inacio lula da silva 
with 34 percent of wednesdays vote counted collor de mello a 
40yearold former state governor had 25 percent or 69 million 
votes according to globo tv the countrys largest commercial 
network 
brizola of the democratic labor party was second with 16 
percent tallying 45 million votes da silva of the 
marxistoriented workers party trailed brizola by less than 
onehalf percent globo said 
in a suprisingly strong showing sen mario covas of the 
leftofcenter brazilian social democracy party was fourth with 38 
million votes or about 142 percent of the total globo said 
computer problems reportedly slowed official results 
at noon 19 hours after the polls closed the countrys superior 
electoral court had tallied just 58 percent of the votes it 
showed collor leading with 266 percent followed by brizola with 
165 percent lula with 163 percent and covas with 89 percent 
final results are not expected until saturday 
more than 82 million voters cast ballots to choose a successor 
to president jose sarney who by law could not run for reelection 
the vote marked the return of full democratic rights after 21 years 
of military rule 
sarney is a civilian but he gained office in 1985 through an 
electoral college vote coordinated by the military 
collor de mello 40 has been a harsh critic of sarney leading 
in the polls since april his dapper good looks and anticorruption 
platform made collor de mello popular with the poor a majority in 
the brazilian electorate 
sarney is widely blamed for official corruption and an annual 
inflation rate of at least 1300 percent 
brazilians ages 18 to 69 were required by law to vote 
federal police chief romeu tuma said in a television interview 
that a small amount of illegal campaigning had been noted but 
reported no other troubles in balloting across the nation of 150 
million 
the superior electoral court originally said it would begin 
releasing the first official results wednesday night then said 
they would not be available until tonight

journalists workers foreign dignitaries government officials and 
party heads turned raucous when the electoral court announced the 
delay several journalists and foreign ambassadors shouted at court 
officials when no explanation was given 
an electoral court official who would not give his name told a 
reporter there was a problem with computer links between brasilia 
the capital and distant voting precincts 
promotional tv spots had said brazils computerized tallying 
system would speed vote counting the results in the 1960 election 
were not announced for three months federal police guarded the 
center during the night 
globo tv kept a parallel computer count and its partial results 
showed the candidates leading in their regional strongholds 
collor de mello a former governor of the poor northeastern 
state of alagoas received strong support in the northern and 
northwestern regions he also led in the southeastern city of 
curitiba and his home city of maceio on the northeastern atlantic 
coast 
da silva a former labor leader had support nationwide and led 
in the southeastern industrial city of belo horizonte and the poor 
northeastern cities of brasilia recife and salvador

rio grande do sul appeared to have his strongest support in the 
heavily populated southern part of the country he led in the 
southern capital cities of porto alegre florianoplis and rio de 
janeiro and the northern city of fortaleza according to globo 
tvs returns 
covas a darkhorse candidate held a strong lead in sao paulo

massachusetts has tied louisiana with the lowest 
longterm bond rating of any state in the nation 
we are at the bottom of the barrel state treasurer robert 
q crane said wednesday after moodys investors service downgraded 
the states 85 billion in longterm debt from a to baa 1 
moodys cited a 721 million budget deficit which has stopped 
gov michael dukakis from talking about the massachusetts 
miracle his term for the states rebounding economy in the mid 
1980s 
the move came the day before the state went to market with 140 
million in shortterm notes to pay off overdue bills in the 
medicaid program which pays medical bills for the poor 
the magnitude of the projected deficit is made all the more 
onerous by the apparent lack of consensus on how to deal with it 
moodys said 
standard and poors corp the other major wall street 
creditrating service let the state keep its a rating but 
placed it on creditwatch and said it would lower the rating if 
massachusetts didnt resolve its difficulties by next month 
lower credit ratings mean a borrower has a greater risk of 
default and must pay higher interest rates on new debt to 
compensate lenders for the additional risk 
the lowering does not directly affect shortterm notes their 
rating was lowered in june from the highest mig 1 rating to mig 2 
according to moodys vice president george leung 
the state plans to sell 250 million in longterm debt next 
month and administration and finance secretary l edward lashman 
said that is when the higher interest rate caused by the lowered 
bond rating really will hurt 
dukakis said he was not surprised by the lowered credit rating 
and he and lashman said it was time for the legislature to raise 
taxes to solve the deficit problem 
weve known for months that unless and until we get this 
budget into balance our credit rating was in jeopardy dukakis 
said the best and the fastest way to do it is to pass a 
responsible revenue package 
moodys strongly criticized the states inability to deal with 
the deficit 
the ratings service noted that the legislature soundly rejected 
a tax increase earlier this year expressing a preference for 
expenditure reductions to achieve budget balance 
but moodys said the deficitreduction package being debated by 
the house would be worth only about 400 million 
leung said the houses vote tuesday to reject a 46 million 
revenueraiser confiscating unclaimed beer and soda bottle and 
can deposits from wholesalers played a role in the lowering of 
the rating 
lashman called that house move the most irresponsible vote i 
have ever seen 
leung said the ratings service did not care whether the state 
balanced the budget with cuts or taxes or both however he said 
it was unlikely the legislature would be willing to balance the 
budget with cuts alone

the cia has launched a 3 million operation 
with the approval of congressional oversight committees to 
overthrow panamanian gen manuel a noriega a newspaper reported 
today 
the covert operation has no restrictions other than an order 
prohibiting noriegas assassination and could involve us troops 
the los angeles times reported citing unidentified sources 
it is an unimpeded effort to try to topple noriega one 
source told the times were going into it with the understanding 
that there may be loss of life though the effort will be not to 
kill anyone 
president bush said at andrews air force base md before 
leaving for houston today that he would neither confirm nor deny 
the report 
if there was a covert operation would i discuss it ever it 
wouldnt be covert if i even referred to it so there will be no 
such discussion of anything which means i am not confirming nor 
denying he told reporters on air force one 
vice president dan quayle also declined to comment directly on 
the report today but when asked if it was proper for the united 
states to try to get involved in an effort to oust noriega he 
replied 
its certainly proper for the united states to state the 
policy very clearly and that policy is that the sooner noriega 
leaves power the better off the people of panama are going to be 
the better off the people of central america are going to be 
asked if the administration and congress were still coordinated 
on the effort to get noriega out quayle said the policy on 
panama and other issues are very closely coordinated with the 
congress this president insists on consultation and he has gone 
out of his way to consult with congress on this and other matters 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since he was 
indicted on drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 by federal 
grand juries in miami and tampa fla 
what it boils down to is that we want him alive in the united 
states or dead one source told the times 
sources told the newspaper the cia believes disgruntled officers 
within the panama defense forces are willing to collaborate in the 
overthrow 
the operation has been dubbed panama5 a referrence to past 
actions against noriega and reflects a renewed commitment by the 
bush administration which drew criticism following the failed oct 
3 coup attempt by dissident panamanian military officers 
administration officials presented the plans for the operation 
to senate and house intelligence committees three weeks ago the 
times said 
during the failed october coup the bush administration said its 
hands were tied by a 13yearold executive order banning us 
involvement in the assassination of foreign figures 
last month the justice department was assigned to make clear a 
series of ford administration executive orders regarding 
clandestine action the times reported 
a clarification memo was written by william p barr assistant 
attorney general in charge of legal counsel sent to cia director 
william h webster and finally delivered to the house and senate 
intelligence committees the newspaper said 
according to the times the memo paves the way for more active 
us involvement in coup attempts not meant to result in 
assassination but that could result in death

a un envoy said today that the latest 
efforts to revive peace talks between iran and iraq have failed 
in a statement isssued by the united nations in baghdad swedish 
diplomat jan eliasson said he has ended his 17day round of 
negotiations 
eliasson said that during his shuttle betweeen tehran and 
baghdad which included 12 meetings with officials of both 
countries he focused on how to implement a un resolution 
outlining a permanent peace accord 
in the course of my talks with the representatives of both 
governments i suggested ways to move the talks forward within the 
framework of un resolution 598 in order to achieve a 
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region he said 
the resolution calls for a withdrawal of both sides forces to 
internationally recognized borders an exchange of prisoners and 
talks leading to a final peace settlement 
the two sides went to war in 1979 after a series of border 
skirmishes fighting ended with a tentative ceasefire on aug 20 
1988 but the sides have yet to agree on a permanent peace 
the un statement which was simultanously released in baghdad 
and in tehran said eliasson was hopeful that further indirect 
talks at the ministerial level would take place later this year in 
new york 
eliasson arrived in baghdad oct 31 and held intensive talks 
with officials from iran and iraq including presidents saddam 
hussein and hashemi rafsanjani 
upon his arrival in the region eliasson and un officials said 
he was not bringing any specific ideas or proposals to the sides 
but would try to convince them to find a formula for restarting the 
negotiations 
neither side has given any idications that they are willing to 
shift position since eliasson began his shuttle more than two weeks 
ago 
but eliasson expressed satisfaction that the 15monthold truce 
in the persian gulf war was holding well 
among the sticking points in the talks has been iraqs claim on 
the shatt alarab waterway that forms part of the frontier between 
the two nations 
baghdad insists that the border must be redrawn to include all 
of the strategic waterway in iraqi territory and has refused to 
withdraw its troops from iranian territory until the issue is 
settled 
another point of contention is the issue of prisonersofwar 
iranian spiritual leader ali khamenei said wednesday that iraq must 
disclose how many prisoners of war it is holding before any 
exchange of pows can take place

moldavias communist party chief was replaced 
today after activists pushed for his ouster saying he blocked 
reform in the southwestern republic wracked by ethnic unrest 
the official news agency tass said semyon k grossu was 
relieved of his duties by the republics policymaking central 
committee because of a transfer it did not give his new post but 
the director of the republics official news agency said he will 
work in moscow in an asyetundetermined job 
his replacement is pytor luchinsky 49 the no 2 party official 
in the republic of tadzhikistan tass reported the news agency 
said he like grossu is an ethnic moldavian 
there was no hint in the report that the moldavian party was 
unhappy with grossu but activists on sunday began circulating a 
petition demanding removal of conservatives in the top echelons of 
the republics government 
grossu and three of his deputies were on the petition because he 
was an inactive archconservative blamed for economic 
ecological and political problems said konstantin bogdanash a 
spokesman for the grassroots group peoples front that organized 
the petition drive 
the activists began the petition drive after a nov 10 clash 
between police and protesters that left almost 200 people injured 
in the capital kishniev 
grossu 55 headed the moldavian communist party since 1980 and 
came under increasing pressure from nationalist activists to 
reverse decades of russification of the republic that borders 
romania 
in the past year moldavian officials agreed to measures aimed 
at preserving the moldavian language and ethnic rights of the 
indigenous population 
moldavia is one of the ethnic hotspots in the soviet union where 
the local population is clamoring for more local control over the 
culture economy and politics

a veteran state senator from the 
crackinfested bronx has sponsored legislation to legalize drugs 
saying the war on drugs has failed 
new yorkers over age 21 should be able to buy marijuana 
cocaine heroin or any drug over the counter without a 
prescription just like a bottle of wine at a liquor store state 
sen joseph galiber contends 
galiber in opening a hearing on his bill today said his 
proposal was years away from becoming law but he said he hoped his 
bill would be a first step toward some legalization 
five years ago this legislation would probably have gotten 
you run out of town galiber said but the time is right now 
robert frohling who monitors state drug laws for the 
denverbased national conference of state legislatures agreed 
there are more people jumping on the bandwagon so theres more 
credence being given to that type of alternative its not just 
some sort of offthewall thing 
but thomas hedrick jr executive director of the partnership 
for a drugfree america wondered is this a joke 
those who have suggested legalization as a possible alternative 
cut across the political spectrum 
they include former secretary of state george shultz economist 
milton friedman and commentator william f buckley jr as well as 
democratic mayor kurt schmoke of baltimore hodding carter iii who 
served as the carter administrations state department spokesman 
and former us attorney general ramsey clark 
still theres little chance the new york bill will become law 
it has no cosponsors and gov mario cuomo already has said hes 
opposed to legalization 
its also unclear whether such a law could supersede federal 
antidrug laws james flateau spokesman for cuomos chief criminal 
justice adviser said today that the federal government could still 
prosecute new york drug cases under its authority to control 
interstate commerce 
frohling said that even though legalizing all drugs was too 
politically sensitive to become reality he expected other states 
to hold hearings on the idea next year 
galiber a democrat with 20 years in the assembly disclaims 
drugs as a good thing its just that all the efforts to stop drug 
use have failed he said 
legalization with a stateregulated drug industry would 
eliminate drug trafficking by taking away the huge profits 
available to pushers said galiber 
by taking away a pushers profits the state could put drug 
dealers out of business and lessen chances that young children 
would get hooked 
the problem then would be teaching new yorkers not to take drugs 
and treating the ones that do said galiber a former social worker 
the socalled war on drugs whatever its called hasnt 
worked said galiber we wont end the demand but we can take 
the huge profits out and remove the heinous criminal elements 
galiber said his proposal might lead to a shortterm increase in 
drug use but he predicted it would improve the states chances of 
solving the problem in the long run 
the way its going now were killing off our youth were 
locking our adults and people into violence people are killing 
each other galiber said im not suggesting that this is the 
answer but we have to try some alternatives 
some people dislike his alternative however 
legalizing illicit drugs would catastrophically expand the 
addiction and use said hedrick whose new york citybased 
nonprofit group produced the tv commercial equating a drug users 
brain with fried eggs remove the big economic issue and you 
remove the criminal element thats just not true 
hedrick said the black market for narcotics would survive 
even if drugs were legalized 
god help us if anything comes of this hedrick said of the 
galiber legislation 
should anything come of it galibers plan would create a new 
state agency almost identical to the one that regulates the liquor 
industry 
licenses to sell drugs would be given to doctors and 
pharmacists as long as theyre not near schools or houses of 
worship 
the state would charge licensing fees of more than 1000 a 
year and would charge sales tax the revenues would pay for drug 
treatment centers

the us merchandise trade deficit tumbled 
from its 1989 high to an imbalance of 79 billion in september 
its lowest level in almost five years as imports dropped sharply 
from augusts record level the government reported today 
the commerce department said the september shortfall in the 
trade balance represented a huge 214 percent drop from a revised 
august deficit of 101 billion which was the widest gap so far 
this year 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the deficit for the 
first three quarters of 1989 is at an annualized 1072 billion in 
line with our expectations of moderate improvement to the 105 
billion110 billion range 
mosbacher said that the august record was an aberration but 
added that septembers figure was significantly below the 1989 
monthly average of 89 billion and must also be viewed 
cautiously 
the narrowing imbalance resulted from a 39 percent decline in 
imports to 391 billion and a 19 percent increase in exports to 
311 billion the deficit is the difference between the two 
the september deficit was the narrowest since a 68 billion 
imbalance in december 1984 
preliminary estimates had put the september imbalance at about 
9 billion 
imports had jumped a revised 5 percent to a record 407 billion 
in august while exports increased a revised 03 percent to 306 
billion 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co had said the 
drop in imports in the september report would be the consequence of 
a slowing economy due to the federal reserves tight rein on credit 
as it strives to contain inflation 
the stock markets were unenthusiastic about the report 
observers said the decline in imports could be interpreted as 
evidence of weakening consumer spending at a time when many 
investors are worried about the outlook for corporate profits 
at the same time chief economist robert g dederick of the 
northern trust co of chicago said the relatively stable exorts 
would be the result of firm overseas markets despite the rising 
value of the dollar which makes us products abroad more 
expensive 
for the first nine months of the year exports increased 19 
percent while imports decreased 39 percent 
the deficit for the year on an annual basis was 1072 billion 
compared with a 1185 billion imbalance for all of 1988 
exports were led in september by a 728 percent improvement in 
aircraft shipments to 197 billion aircraft exports had fallen 
161 percent in august contributing to the increase in that 
months deficit 
export improvements also included office equipment and 
machinery automobiles telecommunications equipment and industrial 
machinery 
contributing to the decrease in imports were industrial supplies 
and bigticket capital goods consumer goods and foods 
the nations foreign oil bill fell 76 percent to 4 billion in 
september the amount of imported oil dropped to 82 million 
barrels a day from 87 million in august while the price per 
barrel rose to 1638 from 1614 
as usual the largest trade deficit in september was with japan 
an imbalance of 41 billion up from 4 billion in august the 
deficit was 13 billion with taiwan 700 million with canada 
500 million with south korea and 700 million with china 
sinai had said a deficit below 95 billion would be encouraging 
because that would be an improvement over the 110 billion gap on 
an annual rate posted six months ago 
imports tend to curb demand for us produced goods and thus 
dampen production and threaten the loss of jobs exports on the 
other hand strengthen demand on domestic production and help 
create more jobs 
the august shortfall between imports and exports was the largest 
imbalance in eight months and was 31 percent higher than the july 
deficit of 824 billion it was also the biggest deficit since 
108 billion last december 
it prompted some analysts to express fear that the worsening 
trade deficit signaled a return to much high imbalances which 
would act to dampen domestic growth in coming months

a congressional critic of an agreement between 
philip morris cos and the national archives to commemorate the 
bicentennial of the bill of rights today lamented the pervasive 
presence of tobacco companies on capitol hill 
the house subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
began an investigation of the agreement as the american cancer 
society launched its 13th annual great american smokeout 
under the agreement philip morris will donate 600000 to the 
national archives trust fund in exchange for authority to publish 
or broadcast announcements and materials promoting the 200th 
anniversary of the bill of rights the materials carry the names of 
both philip morris and the national archives 
its not the text of the ad that troubles me its the 
context said rep chester g atkins dmass 
i am embarrassed too as a member of congress by the 
pervasive presence of tobacco companies on capitol hill you 
cant have an event without it being cosponsored by the cigarette 
industry said atkins 
but rep rick boucher dva said we have a long and 
timehonored practice in the united states of allowing corporate 
america to collaborate with public agencies in order to advertise 
public events 
i would say lets make one exception lets take a 
corporation that sells a product that kills the largest number of 
americans lets say well put them in a little different 
category countered atkins 
philip morris has bought the exclusive rights to the 
constitution which we entrusted to the national archives for the 
modern equivalent of 30 pieces of silver or 600000 rep thomas 
luken dohio chairman of the subcommittee said in announcing 
todays hearing 
luken and rep john conyers dmich called wednesday for 
investigations into the twoyear agreement between philip morris 
and the archives after a consumer health group urged that the 
contract be revoked 
its more than coincidental that the bicentennial campaign 
began shortly before the societys annual nationwide cigarettefree 
day said cancer society spokesman alan davis 
every year just prior to the smokeout one company or another 
tries to grab headlines and change the agenda davis said 
there is no cigarette called philip morris said guy l 
smith the companys vice president of corporate affairs he said 
he did not believe the announcements violated the ad ban 
in the same week that the berlin wall is being torn down that 
people in this country are being criticized for celebrating the 
bill of rights is very strange smith said 
congress specifically encourages the archives to accept 
taxexempt donations to enhance its archival and outreach 
activities said archives spokeswoman susan cooper 
she also said such efforts by the cigarette maker are no 
different from the companys past sponsorship of exhibits at the 
national gallery of art 
sen jeff bingaman dnew mexico has written don wilson the 
archivist of the united states questioning how and why the 
agreement was made the health research group a consumer health 
group last week wrote bingaman asking congress to revoke the 
august agreement 
critics question whether the broadcast announcements violate a 
1971 federal ban on cigarette advertisements on television and 
radio 
the philip morris ads are running on television and do not 
contain any health warning and apparently are a flagrant violation 
of the law prohibiting such video commercials luken said 
you have to ask what does advertising mean said john 
banzhaf chief counsel for action on smoking and health a consumer 
group that led efforts for the federal restrictions it seems to 
me this is advertising since at least one of their purposes 
directly or indirectly is to encourage the sale of cigarettes 
he said

thousands of vietnam veterans injured by the 
toxic defoliant agent orange will get a big portion of their claim 
payments before christmas under a federal judges order 
the judge wants to get the payments to the veterans as soon as 
possible said deborah greenspan a lawyer administering the 
agent orange veteran payment program 
the disbursements which will total nearly 30 million wont 
significantly change the total award an eligible veteran would 
receive but will provide a large share of it in a lumpsum payment 
some 9300 veterans disabled by agent orange during their 
vietnam service will soon receive a single payment of as much as 
8100 said ms greenspan 
from a veterans point of view i think its significant 
ms greenspan said of the ruling made wednesday by us district 
judge jack b weinstein of brooklyn it will give them a chunk of 
money to work with 
the veterans getting the lumpsum checks will continue to 
receive annual payments until 1994 but the amount of the annual 
payments will be reduced to account for the lumpsum payment 
disabled veterans admitted into the agent orange veteran payment 
program by wednesday are eligible for the payments ms greenspan 
said 
the changes weinstein said are possible because an analysis 
of claims processed to date reveals greater than expected funds 
available for distribution such a dividend may not be possible 
in future years in view of falling interest rates 
weinstein who oversees the program also abolished on wednesday 
a requirement that applications to the program must have been filed 
by march 1 1989 or 120 days after the veteran dies or is found to 
be disabled by exposure to the chemical 
the judge also ruled that survivor payments can be made to a 
veterans parents adult children and siblings under the previous 
guidelines compensation could be paid only to surviving spouses 
and dependent children 
the agent orange settlement fund was created by weinstein in 
1984 when seven chemical companies without admitting guilt 
agreed to pay 180 million to settle a classaction lawsuit brought 
by vietnam veterans and their families who alleged injuries because 
of exposure to the chemical during the war 
agent orange widely used by american forces during the vietnam 
war contained the highly toxic chemical dioxin in their lawsuit 
veterans said exposure to the defoliant caused cancer and other 
illnesses as well as birth defects in their children

massachusetts became the second state to ban 
discrimination against homosexuals in housing credit and 
employment ending a 17year legislative battle 
we in massachusetts are again at the forefront of efforts to 
extend civil rights protection to all gov michael s dukakis 
said at a signing ceremony wednesday 
opponents argued the new law establishes special rights for a 
small group and promised to try to get it repealed by a statewide 
vote next year but homosexuals said it finally gives them the 
protection enjoyed by other minority groups 
this is really proof that the gay and lesbian community can 
win in the political and legislative arenas said arline 
isaacson cochair of the massachusetts gay and lesbian political 
caucus 
more than 80 cities and towns nationwide prohibit discrimination 
against homosexuals but only one other state wisconsin has such 
a law according to gay rights groups 
during the final day of debate republican sen edward kirby 
who drew scorn from his colleagues for equating gay rights with the 
demise of western civilization said it provides rights to members 
of a group based on their behavior 
why dont we have an amendment to the bill that protects 
members of the flat earth society kirby said 
in past years senate opponents had bottled the measure up in 
committe even after it received initial approval this year key 
committee posts were changed 
the bill moved through the final legislative stages last month 
when its supporters decided against fighting several senate 
amendments they opposed opting instead for quick passage 
the amendments exempt religious institutions and state that 
massachusetts does not endorse homosexuality or recognize 
homosexual partnerships 
in 1979 the states highest court ruled that the massachusetts 
commission against discrimination could not act on claims based on 
sexual orientation unless the legislature acted to specifically 
prohibit such discrimination 
now that such action has been taken mcad director alex 
rodriguez said he expects to handle 300 to 400 claims from 
homosexuals each year the commission can impose fines and can 
require restitution in employment cases

the navys top brass today defended the 
services safety record and investigation into the explosion aboard 
the uss iowa but the navys top officer acknowledged that the 
future of the iowa and three other battleships may be up for 
grabs because of budget pressures 
rear adm richard milligan told the senate armed services 
committee that he stood by the initial findings of his 
investigation into the gunturret explosion that claimed the lives 
of 47 sailors aboard the iowa last april 19 
milligan said he remains convinced that one of the victims 
gunners mate clayton hartwig appeared to be the most likely 
person to have set off the blast 
he said additional technical tests conducted since he issued his 
report on sept 7 found unique foreign material on the 
projectile from the exploding gun barrel that would not have been 
present during a normal firing of the iowas huge 16inch guns 
now 3 months later i know of nothing that would cause me to 
change my report milligan said in a statement submitted to the 
committee 
milligans boss adm carlisle ah trost the chief of naval 
operations said under questioning by committee members that there 
was no basis whatsoever for retiring the battleships as a 
consequence of the recent spate of accidents that have hit the 
navy 
however trost acknowledged that everything is up for grabs 
today as we face a smaller outyear budget 
he said the four world war iiera battleships brought out of 
mothballs several years ago have made a major contribution to the 
nations combat readiness 
that doesnt say theyre guaranteed to stay and theyll take 
their shot with everybody else in the pentagon as military 
budgets tighten 
the washington post reported in todays editions that placing 
the battleships back into monthballs was under consideration 
trost issued an unprecedented order on tuesday that required a 
sharp cutback in navy training and operations in order to conduct a 
wideranging safety evaluation into the accidents that have plagued 
the service this year 
he told senators he ordered the safety stand down in order 
to discover whether there are some things we can or should do 
better 
we arent running our people into the ground trost said 
attempting to assure the lawmakers that neither budget cutbacks nor 
a high number of operations have caused the string of accidents 
over the past months 
there is no central thread trost said and preliminary 
investigations have shown that some accidents were due to 
mechanical failure acts of god or problems with the performance of 
the personnel involved 
the admiral argued that the navys overall safety record has 
steadily improved over the past five years with the number of major 
accidents running from 118 in 1984 down to 67 in 1989 a major 
accident is considered one in which a death or major loss of 
equipment occurs 
trost said the navys duties to fly thousands of airplanes and 
run hundreds of ships means that there will be mishaps our 
goal is to minimize them 
the admiral said he was looking for reports at the end of the 
safety stand down in order to analyze whether the service could 
improve its performance 
the navy admirals were greeted by the statements of several 
skeptical senators as well as some supporters in the hearing room 
in particular sen alan dixon dill criticized the navys 
iowa report as one that seems based on supposition and guesswork 
rather than fact and physical evidence 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio although not a member of the 
panel appeared as a representative from hartwigs home state and 
offered a statement sharply criticizing the navys findings 
as a lawyer who formerly practiced law i can say unequivocally 
that the navy has no credible case against clayton hartwig 
metzenbaum said there is not enough evidence to take to a grand 
jury let alone to get a jury to convict barring the introduction 
of some new evidence i believe its clear that the navy does not 
know what caused the explosion 
sen john glenn dohio voiced similar reservations in an 
interview earlier saying its a mighty leap of faith for me to 
take this information and jump to the conclusion hartwig is it 
in the milligan report the navy said it found hartwig to be a 
loner who had few friends and was upset about the breakup of a 
friendship with another sailor 
the naval investigative service garnered criticism for its part 
in the investigation since its agents queried hartwigs family and 
associates about a possible homosexual relationship after it was 
discovered that hartwig had designated kendall truitt one of the 
sailors who survived the blast as the recipient of his life 
insurance policy 
in its report however the navy said it found no evidence that 
hartwig was a homosexual 
when the report was issued navy officials acknowledged that 
their evidence was circumstantial in light of the fact that all the 
witnesses including hartwig were killed in the fiery blast 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on investigations has said he seriously 
questioned the navys report and cited an fbi report that said 
its laboratory investigation on the material found in the gun 
barrel was inconclusive 
we didnt find anything that would lead us to conclude that a 
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge an fbi 
spokesman said last month thats not to say something wasnt 
there our findings were inconclusive 
the senate inquiry was the first public congressional 
questioning of navy officials since the report was issued on sept 
7 
the house armed services panel is also looking into the 
explosion while the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress is conducting its own inquiry at the request of 
rep mary rose oakar dohio

while the violence and damage from tornadoes are well known the 
actual mechanics of these storms are complex and not completely 
understood 
they can occur in a variety of situations but are generated most 
often in severe thunderstorms that occur when warm air and cold air 
collide 
the collision forces warm air upward and that creates a low 
pressure area at the ground surrounding air moves in to fill the 
vacuum 
in severe storms cloud tops can rise high into the air 
reaching the level of strong horizontal winds that blow the tops 
into the classic anvil shape often reported around tornadoes when 
this happens more air is pulled upward in something like a chimney 
effect 
the air moving in toward the chimney begins to turn 
counterclockwise and then rises in a twisting column of extreme 
violence 
winds in a tornado are believed to reach more than 200 to 300 
mph although no instruments have ever survived an encounter with 
one of the storms 
normally tornadoes form in the rear portion of severe storms 
which move toward the east or northeast and are separate from the 
heavy rains that occur in these storms

the great cabbage invasion of 1989 has added a 
new leaf to the history of central planning in china 
the newspaper beijing daily declared victory thursday saying 
the city had successfully withstood the crush of 380000 tons of 
cabbage delivered in the annual november stockpiling of chinas 
main winter vegetable 
but the excess supply of cabbage also has been a lesson for 
central planners of the difficulty of matching rigid plans to 
market demands and tastes 
the troubles began last year when farmers turned off by low 
stateset prices didnt produce enough consumers skittish over 
shortages and a 30 percent inflation rate went on a panic buying 
spree 
city officials trying to avoid a repeat of that corraled local 
farmers into planting 24000 acres of cabbage this year up 4700 
acres from 1988 their enticements were better prices and 
guarantees of pesticides and chemical fertilizers treasured 
commodities for chinese farmers 
the result was cabbage chaos 
highways leading into the city were clogged with thousands of 
trucks laden with farmers who were trying to sell before the first 
winter freeze 
pedestrians threaded through mazes of cabbage sometimes stacked 
several yards high piled on almost every streetcorner and spilling 
onto streets apartment entrances and storefronts were blocked with 
mounds of cabbage as the trucks kept pouring in looking for new 
places to dump their produce 
thousands of sanitation workers were mobilized to sweep up the 
garbage and even martial law troops stationed in beijing since 
the bloody suppression of the prodemocracy movement in june 
pitched in to unload and clean up 
demand for cabbage fell its all over the streets so we can 
buy it anytime we want said one hotel worker 
the official china daily also pointed out that beijing youths 
were no longer content to eat nothing but cabbage all winter and 
were turning instead to potatoes cucumbers and cauliflower 
available from greenhouses 
also although cabbage is still very cheap the price did go up 
about 40 percent this year to 12 cents a pound to help allay the 
8 million in subsidies the city paid out last year to keep retail 
prices low 
by the end of the first week of november with 80000 tons of 
unsold cabbage on the streets the government was forced to take 
action 
mayor chen xitong called an emergency meeting nov 7 and issued 
orders that all public offices schools factories and army units 
were to stock up on cabbage 
one worker said his work unit apparently having bought more 
cabbage than it knew what to do with had given him the 220 pounds 
he was lugging home on his bicycle cart he said his wife had 
received another free 220 pounds from her work unit 
a quota of 66 pounds per person in effect through last year was 
lifted and the city vegetable distributing company even promised 
home deliveries 
a foreign student at one university said there are heaps and 
heaps of cabbage around every campus building and the trucks were 
still arriving they asked me to buy cabbage too saying everyone 
was buying 
by nov 11 public institutions had bought 50000 tons of 
cabbage 20 percent more than original plans the beijing daily 
said 
beijing citizens spoke sarcastically of aiguo baicai 
patriotic cabbage a reference to how the government having 
inundated them with the vegetable was appealing to peoples civic 
duty to buy more 
many people did although usually not out of a sense of loyalty 
to the government farmers have gone to a lot of hard work and 
id like to help them out said a 62yearold doctor who bought 
132 pounds for herself and her husband 
she added that the cabbage was particularly tasty this year and 
that its a tradition beijing people love cabbage

three children under age 3 were strangled 
or stabbed to death and mutilated with a steak knife and their 
mother was charged with murder officials said today 
each child had multiple stab wounds hundreds of stab 
wounds said dr jb perdue jr franklin county medical 
examiner he said the childrens abdomens had been cut open and 
their organs were found strewn about the house it was one of the 
worst things ive ever seen if not the worst he said 
the mother katrina mckay 20 was charged with three counts of 
firstdegree murder in the deaths wednesday evening in her home in 
rural franklinton northwest of here said sheriffs department 
capt ralph brown 
perdue said ms mckay left her childrens bodies on a neighbors 
doorstep and was taken into custody after she broke into the mans 
home she was committed to john umstead hospital at butner a 
psychiatric hospital for observation he said 
ive been in law enforcement for 20 years in franklin county 
i would say that this is one of the worst that ive 
witnessed said sheriff arthur johnson you wonder if you could 
have found out something in advance to prevent this from 
happening 
the victims were identified as shenika chantel mckay 2 terrell 
quentin mckay 1 and quincey matthew mckay 2 months perdue said 
perdue said electrical cords and clothing had been tied around

the senate judiciary committee today voted to 
recommend confirmation of san francisco attorney vaughn walker as a 
federal judge rejecting claims that he should be disqualified 
because he waited too long to resign from a club that refuses to 
accept women as members 
i havent found enough in the record to cause me to vote 
against his nomination sen howard m metzenbaum dohio one of 
walkers critics said as the panel sent the longstalled candidacy 
to the full senate by an 112 margin 
the committee also unanimously voted to send to the full senate 
the nomination of president bushs cousin district judge john m 
walker jr of new york for a us court of appeals seat 
the full senate is shooting for action on the nominations before 
thanksgiving and a number of others whisked through the committee 
without debate 
the nomination of vaughn walker no relation to john walker 
for the district court in california had been hanging fire for 
almost two years and became more deeply embattled in february when 
sen alan cranston dcalif who is not on the judiciary 
committee came out against it 
vaughn walker who had strong backing from sen pete wilson 
rcalif resigned from san franciscos olympic club in a letter 
dated feb 15 almost a year after former president reagan 
nominated him for the judicial post 
the club expressly barred blacks from membership until 1968 and 
did not admit its first black member until last year it still does 
not accept women as full members although unmarried daughters and 
wives of members may play tennis there and take part in limited 
other activities 
supreme court justice anthony kennedy was a member of the club 
until shortly before he was nominated for that post kennedy had 
supported easing restrictions against women maintained by the club 
voting against vaughn walker sen edward m kennedy dmass 
told the committee the nominees resignation and contention that he 
had worked to reverse the clubs discriminatory policy was 
nothing more than a cynical effort to get himself confirmed 
also opposing confirmation was sen paul simon dill 
presidential cousin john walker had been opposed for the appeals 
bench by harvard law professor alan dershowitz who said that the 
nomination represented a violation of the nations antinepotism 
law 
dershowitz scoffed at the notion that his opposition stemmed 
from friction between himself and john walker arising out of an old 
lawsuit when the vote came none of the committee members opposed 
the nomination 
also getting favorable recommendations from the committee were 
six other district court nominees edwin l nelson of alabama 
thomas van bebber of kansas susan webber wright of arkansas 
edward w nottingham of colorado arthur d spatt of new york and 
edward j lodge of idaho 
receiving favorable recommendations from the panel were four 
candidates for us attorney they were joyce j george of ohio 
jean paul bradshaw of missouri timonth d leonard of oklahoma and 
gene w shepard of iowa 
the committee voted to recommend cindy shinga daub of nebraska 
as a commissioner of the copyright royalty tribunal she is the 
wife of former rep hal daub rneb

workers at the y12 nuclear weapons plant in 
oak ridge tenn are not adequately protected from exposure to 
radiation a special federal inspection team said in a report 
released thursday 
energy secretary james d watkins ordered his under secretary 
john tuck to prepare a plan for correcting a variety of safety and 
environmental problems at y12 identified by the inspectors 
including the radiation protection flaws 
the plant is owned by the energy department but run by a 
private contractor martin marietta energy systems inc 
tuck was ordered to complete the plan with special 
attention to radiation protection issues by friday according to 
an oct 27 watkins memo attached to the inspection report 
the inspection was performed from sept 25 to oct 20 by a 
special group of private and government experts they and other 
similar groups assembled by watkins last summer have been assessing 
health safety and environmental issues at many of the departments 
nuclear weapons production and assembly facilities 
the y12 plant built in 1943 as part of the manhattan project 
that developed the atomic bombs used against japan in world war ii 
employs about 7000 people making components for nuclear weapons 
it is part of the governmentowned oak ridge reservation a massive 
complex about 20 miles west of knoxville 
among the major flaws in the radiation protection system are a 
failure of the plants health physics specialists to routinely 
check radiation levels in all areas where significant amounts of 
radiation are generated the report said 
the report also said radiation survey results often are poorly 
documented and that the plant does not routinely check for flaws 
in the warning devices and other safety features of equipment that 
generates radiation for example such checks are not routinely 
done on electronbeam welders which produce radiation fields 
comparable to and sometimes higher than xray machines the 
report said 
the report said its inspectors noticed that no health physics 
specialists were present to monitor radiation levels when workers 
removed an air filter from the roof of a building despite the 
potential for spreading contamination on the roof and also for an 
unmonitored release of airborne radiation 
also the report said safety work permits prepared for 
employees at y12 were not an effective means of informing 
workers of the radiological conditions that may be encountered at 
the job site 
the report said martin marietta was aware of the shortcomings 
and was working to correct them 
the inspectors praised martin marietta managers commitment to 
health and safety goals and said the plants operations were 
basically sound however the team found numerous potential 
violations of federal and state environmental regulations 
including discharges of waste into east fork poplar creek 
the report said that while the environmental problems needed to 
be corrected none were of a nature that indicated undue risk to 
public health or the environment with continued operation of the 
y12 plant

coronary bypass can help victims of heart 
disease live better and longer even after they reach their 80s and 
no one should be denied the operation simply because of age says a 
study released thursday 
however doctors cautioned that this common form of surgery 
should be limited to folks who are healthy and independent except 
for serious chest pain 
all 80yearolds are not created equal said dr gail e 
darling people with a lot of other illnesses are not considered 
good candidates for bypass 
but if the patient is otherwise in good shape she said age 
alone should not be a factor in the decision to proceed with 
coronary bypass surgery 
darling a heart surgeon based her recommendation on a review 
of 159 octogenarians who underwent bypass surgery in the past 12 
years at the mayo clinic she presented her findings at the annual 
scientific meeting of the american heart association 
before the operations 97 percent of the patients had severe 
disabling chest pain that occurred while resting or during such 
simple activities as cooking or walking afterward most felt 
dramatic relief from their symptoms and could lead more active 
lives 
an estimated 284000 bypass operations were performed in the 
united states in 1986 darling said that while the surgery has 
become relatively common for people in their 70s many doctors are 
still reluctant to perform it on older folks 
the operation typically costs between 20000 and 30000 some 
have questioned whether it makes economic sense for the very old 
considering the skyrocketing cost of medical care it will 
become more and more of a philosophical issue said dr kent w 
jones of the university of utah when do people get so old that 
we say enough is enough 
the main drawback to the surgery was a relatively high death 
rate of 11 percent however if they survived long enough to be 
discharged from the hospital the patients did relatively well 
overall 84 percent of those undergoing surgery survived at 
least one year and 70 percent were still alive after five years 
darling said this was as good as typical survival for people 
that age and better than what would be expected for those with 
serious heart disease 
between 1977 and 1983 less than onehalf of 1 percent of all 
bypass patients at the mayo clinic were over 80 since then this 
has grown to about 3 percent 
the patients suffered pain because the arteries that carry blood 
to their hearts had become clogged during the operations surgeons 
used pieces of blood vessel to detour blood around the blockages 
restoring free flow to the heart

six jesuits priests were 
tortured and killed today at a leading roman catholic university 
and a priest said uniformed soldiers were seen entering the 
priests residence before the shooting began 
the government and armed forces denied that any troops were 
involved in the massacre which occurred during the sixth day of 
fierce fighting between leftist guerrillas and soldiers of the 
rightist government 
the dead included the rector and vicerector of simeon canas 
central american university the cook and her 15yearold daughter 
who worked at the home also were slain 
they were assassinated with lavish babarity for example they 
took out their brains said the rev jose maria tojeira the 
jesuit provincial for central america he said the victims were 
tortured before they were slain 
the priests were killed their faces disfigured and their brains 
removed from their skulls at the home they shared at the 
university one of central americas most prestigious insitutions 
of higher learning 
if this spiral of violence continues death and destruction 
will sweep away many especially those who are of most use to our 
people san salvadors archbishop arturo rivera damas said after 
leading a prayer over the mutilated bodies 
a jesuit priest who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
journalists at the site that a witness saw about 30 uniformed 
soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests residence 
shortly before the shots rang out 
there have been soldiers posted at the gate since sunday the 
murders were committed in the middle of a curfew the same house 
where they were killed was raided and searched by soldiers on 
tuesday said the priest 
the massacre took place during heavy fighting in san salvador 
where guerrillas of the leftist farabundo marti national liberation 
front were trying to hold on to positions they seized on saturday 
the armed forces and government rejected the accusation that 
troops were involved in the killings in a communique the national 
information center termed the slayings savage and irrational 
it said the crime is intended to destablize the democratic 
process and increase even more the climate of anguish created by 
the fmln farabundo marti national liberation front 
the communique said an investigation into the slayings has begun 
eduardo valdez director of jesuit studies said the jesuits had 
received many anonymous threats in past days and that a rightist 
death squad was probably responsible for the killings the extreme 
right has for more than a decade accused the jesuit order and its 
university of fostering subversive leftist ideology 
tojeira identified the victims as ignacio ellacuria rector of 
the jose simeon canas central american university ignacio 
martinbaro the vice rector and educators segundo montes amando 
lopez juan ramon moreno and joaquin lopez lopez 
the home of the jesuits is located behind the university campus 
on the southwest side of the capital where there has been fighting 
between guerrillas and government troops the bulk of the fighting 
however was on the east and north sides and part of the westside 
of the city 
one priest at the university speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he and other neighbors mistook the shooting at the 
jesuits home as part of the fighting reporters who saw the 
victims at the house said their bodies were riddled with bullets 
some of them fired at the heads 
all but lopez lopez a native salvadoran were spanish by birth 
and naturalized salvadorans 
the university is one of the most highly regarded institutions 
of higher learning in central america 
the slain servant was identified as julia elba ramos he 
15yearold daughter celina was also killed said tojeira 
they did not want to leave witnesses said valdez

the palestinian group run by terror 
mastermind abu nidal has been split by a bloody feud that has 
killed at least 200 members senior plo officials say 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said more 
than 300 of abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council have fled in 
fear from his main base in libya to algeria tunisia and lebanon 
those who fled and many of those killed are believed to be 
dissidents upset with abu nidals management of the organization 
and the direction of the group the dissidents hiding out in 
algiers include some of abu nidals closest former aides including 
atef abu bakr his spokesman since 1986 and abdulrahman issa a 
member of the 10man politburo that ran fatahrevolutionary 
council the sources said in interviews 
most of the killings occurred in lebanon where abu nidal 
loyalists have killed 152 of their adversaries this year 
twenty other dissidents were gunned down in palestinian refugee 
camps in syria the plo officials said 
twentytwo of the groups leading figures were gunned down at 
abu nidals home in a compound used as a training base on the 
outskirts of tripoli the libyan capital the sources reported 
abu nidals real name is sabri albanna he split with yasser 
arafats palestine liberation organization in the early 1970s his 
group is not part of the plo 
in 1985 and 1986 abu nidals gunmen carried out at least 12 
attacks around the world killing 115 people and wounding 500 
these included the november 1985 hijacking of an egyptian airliner 
to malta in which 59 people were killed 
the group is responsible for the rome and vienna airport 
massacres of dec 27 1985 that killed 20 people 
his guerrillas also were held responsible for commandeering a 
pan am jet on sept 5 at the airport in karachi pakistan the 
terrorists opened fire inside the aircraft killing 20 people 
among the abu nidal members killed in the feud were politburo 
members slain in libya late last year and buried in the backyard of 
abu nidals home by bodyguards who poured tons of cement over the 
bodies the sources said 
they included mustafa murad who used the codename abu nizar and 
had been abu nidals righthand man since 1973 and haj abu mousa 
the groups chief instructor 
abu mousa was popular among fatahrevolutionary councils young 
recruits and his assassination apparently prompted most of the 
defections the sources said 
the plo officials said the trouble began in october 1987 when 
some fatahrevolutionary council guerrillas mutinied 
the officials quoted dissidents as saying an air of 
disappointment prevailed among abu nidals men in lebanon after 
he allied with the iranians and the tehranbacked shiite moslem 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god in 1985 
no explanation was offered as to how a communist supposedly 
committed to maoism found common ground for an alliance with 
moslem fundamentalists one official said 
they cited financial corruption internal differences and 
regional alliances as the main cause of the mutiny 
hes tried in vain in recent months to reorganize the group 
recruit new members from the syrian and libyan intelligence 
services but no one wants to follow a loser a palestinian 
official said from tunis 
abu nidal 52 has dissolved fatahrevolutionary councils 
politburo and assumed full control of the movement appointing 
majed atta his nieces husband as his deputy the sources said

prime minister rajiv gandhis congress 
party is likely to lose its governing majority in elections next 
week because of corruption allegations according to opinion poll 
results released thursday 
the poll conducted for sunday magazine indicates gandhis 
party will win only 180 to 215 seats in the 542member parliament 
a steep fall from the 415 seats it won in 1984 
the indian voter is angry disillusioned and cynical most of 
that resentment will probably find its way to the polling booth in 
the form of a vote against congress party the weekly magazine 
said in a preview thursday full results are to be released 
saturday 
the party is contesting 509 seats in the nov 22 24 and 26 
elections that poll analysts say will be the toughest for the party 
since 1977 when it lost for the only time since independence from 
britain in 1947 
at that time the opposition had united it soon splintered due 
to internal squabbles and the congress came back to power in the 
1980 elections 
this year major opposition parties again united to form a 
coalition led by vishwanath pratap singh who resigned in 1987 as 
gandhis defense minister 
however sunday magazine said its poll showed it is the 
negative vote that will decide this election the ninth since 
india gained independence 
although the voter does not perceive opposition politicians also 
as honest anger at government corruption will result in negative 
vote said the poll which questioned 11500 voters in 38 
constituencies 
a congress party spokesman anand sharma dismissed the results 
in the 1984 elections the same magazine said the congress 
party will win 250 seats sharma said if they were that wide 
off the mark then they have not shown any substantial 
improvement 
the 1984 polls were conducted by a different agency 
more than half the voters asked in northern and western india 
believed that corruption has increased since gandhi came to power 
in 1984 the latest poll found these concerns were nationwide but 
voters in the south were less concerned about corruption 
an alarmingly large proportion of respondents believe that the 
prime minister is personally corrupt said the poll which the 
magazine said was largest of its kind ever conducted in india 
gandhi has been dogged since april 1987 by allegations that 
members of his party and senior government officials received as 
much as 50 million in kickbacks in a 14 billion gun contract 
with a swedish company ab bofors 
gandhi repeatedly denying the charge has also said no indian 
received commissions or kickbacks from bofors but the issue has 
been seized upon by the opposition as its main campaign platform 
gandhis landslide victory in december 1984 was attributed to 
the sympathy wave generated by the assassination two months earlier 
of prime minister indira gandhi his mother 
the last poll was published in august by the newsmagazine india 
today that poll predicted the congress party would win 314 seats 
but only if the opposition parties failed to unite it said a 
united opposition could cut the congress partys seats to 244 less 
than half the seats in parliament

and shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a 
3mile stretch of destruction killing 17 people injuring 463 and 
leaving 1000 homeless 
its like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a 
blender and putting it on liquefy said rescue worker bob 
caraway whose specialty is cave rescues he was among those called 
out to help dig through rubble for survivors or the bodies of the 
dead 
the tornado was one of a series that touched down wednesday in 
an arc spanning at least seven states from the deep south to the 
midwest the other tornadoes caused at least 19 injuries and 
farflung property damage 
in huntsville teams with cranes and floodlights searched for 
the injured or dead hampered by windwhipped rain and temperatures 
that plummeted overnight from 73 degrees into the 30s 
gov guy hunt sent 50 national guardsmen to help and said he 
would view damage friday his spokesman terry abbott said aerial 
surveys indicate the twister hopped along a 25mile path much of 
it straight through huntsville 
by this afternoon severe thunderstorms were crossing the 
northeast the national weather service put out a tornado watch for 
parts of maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york 
all of connecticut and rhode island and parts of massachusetts 
vermont and new hampshire 
in pennsylvania the weather service said it received 
unconfirmed reports of a tornado that turned over a car and knocked 
down trees and power lines near gettysburg 
elsewhere

moldavias communist party chief was removed 
thursday after activists criticized him for slowing reforms in his 
republic wracked by ethnically motivated strikes clashes and 
demonstrations 
the republics policymaking central committee relieved semyon 
k grossu as its first secretary because of a transfer to another 
job tass said it did not identify his new post but the director 
of the republics official news agency said grossu would work in 
moscow in a yettobe determined job 
grossus replacement is pytor luchinsky 49 who has been 
serving as the second highest party official in the republic of 
tadzhikistan tass reported like grossu luchinsky is an ethnic 
moldavian 
moldavia is one of the many ethnic trouble spots in the soviet 
union where the population is clamoring for more control over its 
culture economy and politics and is running into opposition from 
ethnic minorities led by russians 
the tass report did not hint the moldavian party was unhappy 
with grossu but activists on sunday began circulating a petition 
demanding removal of conservatives among the republics top 
officials 
grossu and three of his deputies were on the list because he was 
an inactive archconservative blamed for economic ecological 
and political problems said konstantin bogdanash a spokesman for 
the grassroots group peoples front that organized the petition 
drive 
the peoples front began the campaign after a nov 10 brawl 
between police and protesters that left almost 200 people injured 
the demonstrators were demanding the release of 20 people arrested 
three days earlier while trying to stage another protest 
activist pyotor shornikov a leader of a group representing 
ethnic minorities in moldavia has called the southwestern republic 
once ruled by leonid i brezhnev one of the epicenters of 
stagnation and grossu has become a target of growing criticism 
asked why grossu was removed fyodr a angeli the director of 
atem moldavias news agency said by telephone from the moldavian 
capital of kishinev that the step was logical after the events 
of nov 7 and 10 but he added grossu had been talking for at least 
a halfyear about stepping down 
grossu 55 headed the moldavian communist party since 1980 and 
came under increasing pressure from nationalist activists to 
reverse decades of russification of the southwestern republic 
on the border with romania in the past year moldavian officials 
agreed to measures aimed at preserving the moldavian language and 
ethnic rights of the indigenous population 
but strikes and demonstrations became common as ethnic 
moldavians and ethnic minorities living in the republic led by 
russians traded charges of discrimination of the republics 42 
million people 64 percent are moldavians with the rest russians 
ukrainians bulgarians jews and christian turks 
grossu appeared on the national tv newscast vremya on 
wednesday saying a package of economic reforms including spending 
more money on food and consumer goods supplies and the social and 
cultural spheres should help ease the tension in our republic 
bogdanash also speaking by telephone from kishinev predicted 
moldavians would welcome luchinskys election because he is 
respected as cultured politically experienced energetic and 
intelligent before moving to tadzhikistan luchinsky worked as 
the no 2 party official in moldavia 
under president mikhail s gorbachev communist party chiefs 
have been replaced in many of the ethnically troubled republics in 
many cases with more liberal officials these include estonia 
lithuania armenia uzbekistan kazakhstan azerbaijan and the 
ukraine

government forces attacked 
rebel positions today in the fiercest combat of the 5dayold 
battle of san salvador six priests were tortured and killed in a 
massacre at a roman catholic school 
one church leader said the brutal slayings were probably the 
work of rightist death squads but a priest at the scene said 
uniformed soldiers were spotted entering the priests residence 
before the shooting began 
the government and armed forces denied that any troops were 
involved 
nearly 700 people have died in the fighting in and around san 
salvador 
the resounding boom of army mortars and reports from assault 
rifles echoed across the capital with fire from the zacamil 
neighborhood on the northern edge almost continuous from shortly 
before 4 am until dawn 
red tracer bullets and orange flares dropped by circling 
helicopters lighted the night sky 
light tanks were seen heading toward the embattled district 
a37 fighterbombers screamed low over the city in several runs 
westward presumably toward rebel positions near the western suburb 
of merliot where fighting was heavy wednesday night 
deafening explosions following the swoops gave the impression 
the planes were dropping 250pound or 500pound bombs on insurgents 
concentrated on the lower slopes of the san salvador volcano 
the six jesuit priests were slain at about 3 am their faces 
disfigured and their brains removed from their skulls at the home 
they shared on adjoining the grounds of jose simeon canas central 
american university one of the regions most prestigious 
insitutions of higher learning the victims were tortured then 
shot to death officials said 
if this spiral of violence continues death and destruction 
will sweep away many especially those who are of most use to our 
people san salvadors archbishop arturo rivera damas said after 
leading a prayer over the mutilated bodies 
eduardo valdez director of jesuit studies said the jesuits had 
received many anonymous threats in past days and that a rightist 
death squad was probably responsible for the killings the extreme 
right has for more than a decade accused the jesuit order and its 
university of fostering subversive leftist ideology 
a jesuit priest who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
journalists at the site of the massacre that a witness saw about 30 
uniformed soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests 
residence shortly before the shots rang out 
there have been soldiers posted at the gate since sunday the 
murders were committed in the middle of a curfew the same house 
where they were killed was raided and searched by soldiers on 
tuesday said the priest 
the rev jose maria tojeira the jesuit provincial for central 
america identified the slain priests as ignacio ellacuria the 
university rector ignacio martinbaro the vicerector segundo 
montes amando lopez juan ramon moreno and joaquin lopez lopez 
tojeira said their domestic servant and her daughter were also 
killed 
they did not want to leave witnesses said valdez 
a dusktodawn curfew prevented travel to the combat zones until 
daybreak and it was not immediately clear if the sustained fire 
was causing heavy casualties 
the rebels had fortified positions in several sixstory 
lowincome apartment blocks in zacamil most civilians had 
evacuated the buildings by late wednesday but scores remained in 
the dwellings 
as of wednesday night more than 680 soldiers rebels and 
civilians had been killed and another 1600 wounded in the pitched 
fighting according to hospital morgue and government sources 
among them at least 100 civilians have been killed and 800 
injured the sources said the fighting has been concentrated in 
densely populated workingclass districts on the capitals 
outskirts 
on wednesday government troops drove insurgents from some 
outlying capital districts but rebels repelled repeated army 
assaults in others 
though the government held an advantage in numbers and weaponry 
many rebel units held their ground in fierce fighting while others 
forced into retreat regrouped to strike again 
since the offensive began saturday government troops have 
apparently not shelled or bombed rebel positions likely for fear 
of inflicting high civilian casualties 
the government of rightist president alfredo cristiani has 
accused the guerrillas of shielding themselves behind civilians 
but that has not stopped government soldiers from rocketing and 
strafing rebel strongholds from helicopters and airplanes damaging 
and wrecking thousands of homes in the citys northern reaches 
many civilians in neighborhoods held by guerrillas have been 
caught in the crossfire as government forces have raked rebel 
positions with large caliber machinegun fire or rocketed from 
aloft 
the us embassy said the dead include 146 soldiers and 434 
guerrillas while 362 soldiers and 457 rebels have been wounded 
the government which on sunday decreed a state of siege 
suspending most constitutional guarantees tightened limits on 
freedom of expression wednesday with a directive sent to all local 
media 
salvadoran media are prohibited from publishing any communiques 
issued by the rebels or by any group that circulates word on rebel 
activities 
the rebels claimed to hold about a quarter of the country and 
radio correspondents in the countryside said fighting continued 
wednesday in and around the provincial capitals of san miguel 
santa ana and zacatecoluca 
in the capital several hundred rebels including two top 
commanders were dug in wednesday at the northern district of 
mejicanos 
the scene there differed from that in zacamil and soyapango 
other guerrilla strongholds in recent days in that most mejicanos 
residents have stayed on in their homes and many appear aligned 
with the rebels 
in some neighborhoods residents could be seen feeding and 
giving other assistance to rebel fighters 
the rebels say they mounted the offensive their largest since 
1981 largely in response to a series of attacks on leftist 
civilian leaders that included the bombing of a union hall oct 31 
that claimed 10 lives 
many leaders of union peasant and student organizations 
considered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone underground 
this week 
the 10yearold civil war between the rebel front and a 
succession of usbacked governments has claimed the lives of 
about 70000 people most of them civilians

wine lovers uncorking the 1989 beaujolais nouveau 
on thursday nearly unanimously agreed the pricey wine heralds great 
promise for other french wineproducing regions 
sophisticated and pedestrian palates confirmed predictions by 
promoters that the fruity young wine the first released since the 
autumn grape harvest ranks as the best in decades 
you never know how good a wine is going to be until you drink 
it lawyer yves milon said at a party celebrating the ritual 
opening of the first bottles of the new wine on the third thursday 
of november now that ive tasted it i know 
if all the 89 wines are this good its going to be a great 
year he said 
robert cointepas owner of the taverne henri iv near notre dame 
cathedral detailed his satisfaction with the wines clarity color 
and bouquet as shouts of vive le nouveau rang out from 
indulgent tipplers packed into his celebrated wine bar 
john powell 26 of palo alto calif had a somewhat more basic 
measure of quality if im still standing in five hours thatll 
tell you how good it is 
a consumption embargo on the wine was lifted at midnight 
wednesday but most parisians held off serious drinking until the 
early morning at lunchtime thursday dozens of parties sprang up 
throughout the capital 
promoters called the 1989 stock the best in a quartercentury 
this is an exceptional year for beaujolais and all the 
vintages in france said michel deflache of the union 
interprofessionnelle des vins du beaujolais the producers 
association 
wine drinkers around the world await the beverage each november 
arriving by plane train truck and ship in a massive public 
relations campaign 
hundreds of japanese raced to tokyos international airport 
wednesday night to get a first taste of the wine at midnight eight 
hours before the wine was allowed to be uncorked in france 
the marketing by deflaches organization has boosted the 
littleknown firstpress wine to world fame in two decades while 
critics and admirers continue to debate the wines real merits 
twenty years ago this wine was nothing and its still 
nothing declared jacques constant at the bar st philippe in the 
fashionable faubourg st honore shopping district the real 
french wines are the bordeaux and bourgogne 
bar owner rene bourel vigorously disagreed i prefer the 
beaujolais to the bordeaux why its like a blonde woman or a 
brunette a matter of taste 
a long dry summer and early rainfree harvest have led to 
expectations that this years french wines could rank among the 
best this century 
as the first wines of the year the beaujolais nouveau normally 
considered an inexpensive lightweight served as a bellwether to 
both quality and the price the market will bear 
wholesale beaujolais nouveau rose as much as 30 percent this 
year deflache said retailing for an average of 4 per bottle in 
paris and nearly 17 in tokyo 
about half of this years production of 44 million cases went 
to foreign markets principally west germany britain belgium the 
united states and japan 
the japanese market remains the fastestgrowing deflache said 
with demand jumping from 300000 cases in 1988 to 440000 cases 
this year the us market represents an equivalent number of sales

congressional supporters of expanded federal 
financing of abortions are conceding defeat for this year but say 
theyll renew their fight next year aided by growing political 
pressures 
this is not the last inning not by any means said rep les 
aucoin dore a leader of the abortionrights lawmakers we 
still have next year and if that doesnt work out we have next 
novembers elections 
the house on wednesday approved an appropriations bill for 
health and other programs that includes abortion language 
demanded by president bush that continues the ban on federally 
funded abortions for poor women except when the life of the mother 
is in danger 
bush vetoed a previous version of the bill last month because it 
would have permitted federally financed medicaid abortions for poor 
women who are victims of rape or incest 
the senate approved the bill today after adding a series of 
unrelated amendments including one providing penalties for 
providing dialaporn obscene telephone communications to 
minors the bill now goes back to the house for concurrence 
the senate passed the appropriations bill on a voice vote and 
with virtually no mention of the abortion issue sen arlen 
specter rpa noted that the house had failed to sustain bushs 
veto of the abortion provision 
that is the conclusion of that issue specter said the 
time has come for us to move ahead the time for talk has 
ended 
although the rapeandincest provision covers a relatively small 
number of additional abortions by most estimates the issue became 
a symbolic battleground in the political struggle over abortion 
that struggle has taken on increased intensity since the supreme 
court last summer gave states more leeway to regulate abortions 
and proponents of abortion rights won key elections last week in 
virginia and new jersey 
last months house vote was the first time in a decade it had 
backed the more liberal abortion provisions which the senate also 
approved but the house failed by 51 votes to override bushs veto 
aucoin said abortionrights supporters believe political 
pressure will build as a result of bushs veto and increased public 
attention on the abortion issue 
they rejected what they described as compromise efforts by 
antiabortion lawmakers to permit financing of abortions for rape 
and incest victims who report the crimes within a time limit such 
as 72 hours aucoin said that would be a bogus compromise 
providing political cover to lawmakers who voted to sustain bushs 
veto 
the house approved the bill on a voice vote after an emotional 
and sometimes bitter revival of the debate over abortion 
antiabortion forces did not attempt to amend or defeat the measure 
rep henry hyde rill who has led the fight for abortion 
restrictions took strong exception to aucoins reference to hydes 
side as being antichoice and hurled stronger words back 
the prokiller crowd the death squads of the left hyde 
said we can play that game too 
the disputed abortion provision is part of a 157 billion 
appropriations bill for labor education and health programs for 
the 1990 fiscal year 
the house and senate both approved another appropriations bill 
for the district of columbia which bush similarly vetoed because 
of abortion the new version approved 229191 prohibits the use 
of federal money for dcfunded abortions except when the mothers 
life is endangered but would let the district government use local 
funds for abortions 
antiabortion forces said the house action on the dc bill 
could invite another bush veto 
at the same time the administation suffered at least a 
temporary setback in the senate which voted 5244 to insist on a 
provision in a foreign aid spending bill that would send 15 
million to the united nations population fund 
abortion opponents want to delete the money because the un 
agency operates in china which has restrictive limits on family 
size and allegedly imposes forced abortions and sterilizations on 
women the senate vote sent the bill back to the house which voted 
a day earlier to give bush the final decision on whether o fund the 
un agency

the house voted today to raise members 
salaries by more than a third and to tighten ethics rules which 
allow lawmakers to earn much of their income elsewhere 
the bill was passed 252174 and sent to the senate after a 
debate sprinkled withreferences to the fact that voting for pay 
raises was a politically sensitive proposition 
house members now make 89500 a year under the new bill they 
would make more than 120000 within less than 14 months 
weve decided to reinvest in this institution and take the 
responsibility for its future said rep vic fazio dcalif 
cochairman of the task force that drafted the legislation 
this is a little like root canal work without the anesthesia 
its painful but it needs to be done said rep thomas downey 
dny 
but rep james a traficant dohio argued against the 
legislation 
i understand the game we come with ethics reform and we 
sneak in a pay raise traficant said now is not that time 
he said citing huge budget and trade deficits youre not 
rewarded for losing 
the package introduced wednesday by house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash had strong bipartisan support and the backing of 
president bush 
this is truly an ethics package said house minority whip 
newt gingrich rga citing a series of reforms that would 
accompany the salary increases spread over the next 14 months 
the plan does not include a raise for the senate where majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine said lawmakers might go for a more 
gradual pay plan and elimination of honoraria the issue will come 
up friday he said today 
under the plan house members federal judges and top executive 
branch officials would receive 79 percent in cost of living raises 
by january making up for inflation since the last congressional 
pay raise in early 1987 
on jan 1 1991 those officials would receive another 
asyetundetermined cost of living increase whatever rank and 
file civil servants are given then plus a 25 percent pay boost 
at that time new rules would require house members to stop 
pocketing money from speeches and limit other outside earned income 
to 15 percent of their congressional salaries 
the total pay increase would be about 35 percent if there was no 
1991 cost of living raise if it followed the pattern of the 
previous two years 41 percent and 36 percent the pay raise 
would be closer to 40 percent with salaries reaching about 125000 
the longawaited package was unveiled wednesday by the joint 
house leadership just as bush was sending a letter to capitol hill 
giving it his blessing 
in my view the bill would effect a tremendous change in the 
landscape of government ethics standards the president said 
leaders appeared confident the senate will approve the raises 
for the house and other officials although that scenario would 
repeat a situation that existed seven years ago when for about six 
months the house was paid more than the senate 
that prospect is less than attractive to many senators and 
there appeared this week to be growing support for the house plan 
however senate rules make it possible for even a single senator to 
block the majority will especially with congress trying to end its 
session before thanksgiving 
the house plan was worked out in close consultation with the 
white house which has been desperately seeking to raise salaries 
for federal judges and top agency officials 
president reagan as he left office in january proposed a 51 
percent pay raise for congress and the other officials but congress 
was forced to kill it after a storm of public protest 
wednesdays letter of support from the president was crucial not 
only for gop support but for democrats who will use it to 
inoculate themselves from republican attacks in next years 
elections 
at the joint news conference on wednesday the drafters of the 
new plan conceded it wasnt without faults for example the 
honoraria ban allows members to make speeches and have the hosts 
donate to charity on their behalf a useful political tool

the national endowment for the arts today 
reversed itself and awarded a 10000 grant to an aids art exhibit 
just hours before the show was scheduled to open 
endowment chairman john e frohnmayer who toured the show and 
discussed the grant with a group of new york city artists on 
wednesday announced the decision 
after consulting with members of the national council on the 
arts several of whom have also seen the show i have agreed to 
approve the request of artists space and will release the grant 
for the exhibition only said frohnmayer the endowment said it 
will not fund the shows catalog which frohnmayer has called too 
political to merit federal support 
the show witnesses against our vanishing opens this 
evening at artists space said susan wyatt the private gallerys 
executive director 
frohnmayer had said at a wednesday news conference that he 
planned to discuss the funding issue with members of the endowment 
and reflect on what ive seen in a quick tour wednesday morning 
the part of the show ive had a chance to see lacked artistic 
merit frohnmayer said 
the show featuring works by 23 painters sculptors and 
photographers that portray the effects of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome on the arts community was unchanged by the 
funding controversy wyatt said 
frohnmayer said last week that the endowment was withholding the 
10000 because the shows content differed from what its grant 
application said and because the show lacked artistic merit 
the endowment had approved a grant in may for the show which 
has some sexual images but since then congress has passed a law 
putting limits on federal support of art that could be deemed to be 
obscene 
frohnmayer has objected to the catalog for the aids exhibit for 
its denunciation of sen jesse helms rnc chief sponsor of the 
antiobscenity law and other public figures who have taken a 
conservative position on the aids issue 
the artists whose works are featured in the show issued a 
statement read by participant allen frame that said the endowment 
was becoming a vehicle for repression 
we understand this suppression to be endemic of a broad 
pattern of government challenges to individual and community 
rights thus it enrages us but does not surprise us that by 
expressing ourselves on the subject of aids we are now under 
attack it said 
inverna lockpez president of the national association of 
artists organizations charged frohnmayer had allowed the 
perception to evolve that hes caving into homophobic tactics on 
the part of a few vocal congressmen

the nations merchandise trade deficit in 
september tumbled to 79 billion its smallest imbalance in nearly 
five years the government said thursday in a report that analysts 
viewed as evidence of strong overseas economies but weakness at 
home 
the commerce department said the september deficit fell 214 
percent from august when the trade gap posted a 101 billion 
difference the largest of the year 
the drop resulted from a 39 percent decline in imports to 39 
billion and a 19 percent gain in exports to 311 billion the 
deficit is the difference between the two 
analysts said that while the improvement is encouraging on the 
surface it is as chief economist allen sinai of the boston co 
said coming about principally from a weak us economy and very 
prosperous overseas economies 
reaction also was unenthusiastic on wall street where stock 
market observers also interpreted the drop in imports as evidence 
of weakening consumer spending 
but the figures were good news for the bush adminstration which 
based its predictions of healthy economic growth partly on the 
belief that exports would keep expanding 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said that while imports have 
fallen back to their monthly average for the year exports remain 
high mosbacher noted the figures were in line with administration 
expectations of a 1989 deficit ranging between 105 billion and 
110 billion 
but treasury undersecretary david mulford told a senate banking 
subcommittee that while thursdays trade report was very 
positive the improvement could stall by next year unless the 
united states and its major trading partners do a better job of 
coordinating their economic policies 
further improvement during 1990 we think will be 
modest at best and theres soe possibility of a deterioration he 
said however its interesting to note that the adjustment 
process continues 
to maintain progress on shrinking the trade gap the us must 
push down its budget deficit and japan and west germany must 
stimulate their domestic demand for imports he said 
the trade gap for the first nine months on an annualized basis 
was 1072 billion compared with a 1185 billion imbalance for 
all of 1988 
the september imbalance was the narrowest since a 68 billion 
deficit in december 1984 
leading the exports was a 728 percent gain in civilian aircraft 
shipments to 197 billion mosbacher said most of the aircraft 
went to western europe 
the united states is running a 14 billion trade surplus with 
the european economic community for the year sinai said that was 
evidence of prosperous economies since those nations continue to 
buy us goods despite a relatively expensive dollar which make 
those goods more costly 
michael k evns of evans economics inc in washington said 
european growth has doubled from 1988 to 1989 and its economy will 
continue to be robust for the next two or three years enhancing 
the export outlook 
at the same time americans spent less on imports in september 
particularly for bigticket capital goods and other industrial 
materials used in manufacturing 
this confirms the manufacturing recession that seems to be in 
place sinai said 
an exception to the drop in imports was consumer goods which 
rose slightly not surprising since consumers have continued to 
spend dispite weakness in manufacturing 
the manufacturing sector has been particularly hit by 
sluggishness as the federal reserve slows the economy by keeping a 
tight rein on credit to contain inflation 
in addition to aircraft export improvements included office 
equipment and machinery automobiles telecommunications equipment 
and industrial machinery 
the nations foreign oil bill fell 76 percent to 4 billion in 
september the amount of imported oil dropped to 82 million 
barrels a day from 87 million in august while the price per 
barrel rose to 1638 from 1614 
as usual the largest trade deficit in september was with japan 
an imbalance of 41 billion up from 4 billion in august the 
deficit was 13 billion with taiwan 700 million with canada 
500 million with south korea and 700 million with china

senate efforts to overhaul the nations 
racketeering law stalled thursday while members of both parties 
rallied to defend the sponsor arizona democrat dennis deconcini 
from consumer advocate ralph naders charge that the bill was 
designed to dilute curbs against whitecollar crime 
this isnt just some little mickey mouse bill thats supported 
by business sen orrin hatch rutah declared after the bill 
bogged down in the judiciary committee 
the deconcini measure would overhaul the 1970 racketeer 
influenced corrupt organizations act the law known as rico for 
short was primarily intended as a weapon against criminal mobs 
recent years however have witnessed a sharp upturn in civil 
lawsuits filed under rico against insurance companies savings and 
loan associations accounting firms and an array of other 
businesses 
deconcinis bill would cut back on provisions that enable those 
who file such rico suits to collect triple damages 
the judiciary committee had been expected to draw up its final 
version of the bill and send it to the floor on thursday but 
efforts to do so broke down when the committee ran out of time with 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio saying he still had substantial 
reservations 
im willing to reform rico but not to gut it metzenbaum 
said 
judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr ddel said that he 
would try to make time for a fullscale debate on the measure 
within the committee before thanksgiving when lawmakers hope to 
have their work wrapped up for the year 
but it appeared that final committee action on the measure might 
have to wait until next year 
after the bill stalled members of the committee rallied to 
defend deconcini against naders charges a day earlier biden said 
he had seen nothing but good solid reasonable intentions from 
the senator from arizona 
i think its shameful to in any way question the motives of 
sen deconcini for his involvement in this bill metzenbaum said 
i think the senator from arizona has been badly maligned on 
this bill just in the last couple of days hatch said 
on wednesday nader counted deconcini among a panoply of 
purchased politicians who aided phoenix financier charles 
keating the central figure in the burgeoning lincoln savings and 
loan scandal 
naders charge was rooted in the testimony of edwin j gray 
former chairman of the federal home loan bank board who told a 
house panel earlier this month that deconcini in the presence of 
four other senators once asked him to drop a rule barring risky 
investments by lincoln savings deconcini and the others all 
disputed grays account of the conversation 
now the ringleader of the keating five sen deconcini is 
responding to the swirling controversy by pushing a bill that would 
weaken the whitecollar crime laws nader told a news conference 
he said deconcinis bill would gut the very law used by 
regulators against his friend charles keating

the government has ordered all staterun 
factories enterprises and work units to crack down on little 
coffers funds siphoned off from official projects and profits 
leading newspapers said thursday 
these little coffers are an important reason for losses by 
the state treasury said the workers daily it is not only 
contributing to waste and corruption but also destroys the spirit 
of the party and social temperment 
little coffers consist of misappropriated cash such as 
funds illegally made from the seizure and interception of state 
and unit revenue taking over public property and illegal 
savings said the peoples daily the communist partys official 
newspaper 
such funds also are hidden by accountants as they are not 
listed in the accounts of the financial departments of units and 
are not included in final accounts the peoples daily said 
the state council chinas legislature has issued a circular 
calling for selfpolicing by leaders at all levels to root out such 
fraud and profiteering 
the reports did not give the estimated value of economic losses 
but such corruption from smallscale pricegouging to massive 
embezzlement is rampant in china 
in october shanghai discovered 1256 little coffers 
amounting to 72 million the peoples daily said 
similar funds totaling 13 million were recovered in hubei 
province and the city of tianjin bordering beijing and china oil 
and gas corp recovered 19 million the newspaper said 
winning back illgotten gains is of crucial value in 
consolidating and rectifying the situation and strengthening the 
construction of a clean and honest government said the circular 
reprinted in several newspapers 
organizations that disclose little coffers formed by turning 
public money to private gain in their ranks and report to 
authorities by dec 15 will be treated leniently the reports said 
those enterprises will be allowed to retain half their illgotten 
profits while turning over the other half to the state it said 
those which do not turn themselves in however must return any 
money they have spent turn over all illegal profits to the state 
and be fined according to the circular it added that the 
superiors of those involved also would be held responsible

illinois abortion clinic regulations if 
upheld in a key supreme court case would have a devastating 
nationwide impact on womens access to the operation abortion 
rights groups said thursday 
the regulations have the potential to seriously curtail if 
not eliminate entirely the ability of most american women to 
choose abortion said barbara radford head of the national 
abortion federation if the court upholds the illinois law she 
said it could turn the clock back to an era of virtual 
prohibition of abortion 
the federation and planned parenthood announced the results of a 
national survey that said 98 percent of abortion clinics would be 
violating at least one of the illinois rules if they were adopted 
by the clinics home states 
threefourths of the clinics said the regulations would force 
them to relocate and could drive them out of business 
supporters of the illinois law have said the impact would be 
minimal adding 45 to the cost of an abortion 
the high court plans to hear arguments in the illinois case dec 
5 but talks are under way between state officials and an abortion 
clinic owner to settle the dispute and eliminate the need for a 
ruling by the justices 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan a democrat who plans to 
run for governor next year is leading the effort to reach a 
settlement 
ms radford said even if a compromise disposes of the illinois 
case the issues it raised will remain alive 
were still going to see efforts by other states to adopt 
regulations almost identical to the illinois law she said 
the 254 clinics that responded to the survey announced thursday 
perform about onethird of the 15 million abortions each year in 
the united states nearly all said conforming to the regulations 
would be extremely costly and perhaps impossible 
the illinois regulations were declared unconstitutional by 
federal courts that said they would force the clinics to become 
the functional equivalent of small hospitals 
for example the rules require separate facilities such as 
lockers and lavatories for male and female employees and eightfoot 
wide corridors for patients 
dr louise tyrer of planned parenthood in a statement read by 
colleague william hamilton said the rules are not designed to 
protect the health of women 
we have a case of politicians claiming to know more about 
medical procedure than the medical profession these politicians 
would have us all believe that abortions are dangerous dr tyrer 
said she said abortions are safer than practically any other 
commonly performed surgery 
the supreme court is reviewing two other abortion cases this 
term they test the validity of minnesota and ohio laws requiring 
notification of parents whose minor daughters want abortions 
the justices in july gave states new power to regulate 
abortions upholding a missouri law while stopping short of 
overturning their 1973 ruling that said women have a constitutional 
right to an abortion 
the july ruling touched off widespread activity in state 
legislatures and state political races

rising prescription drug costs are forcing 
some people to choose between meals and medicine as they encounter 
far steeper prices than large purchasers such as hospitals are 
charged a senate panel was told thursday 
something is seriously wrong when the incredible disparity in 
the cost of drugs is realized pharmacist michael berryman told 
the special committee on aging 
berryman chairman of the board that oversees virginias 
medicaid program said an elderly woman in his home town of 
kenbridge va pays 120 a month for the same drugs that cost a 
local hospital 30 
the committee chairman sen david pryor dark said the 
hearing was called to address a crisis of affordability on 
prescription drugs whose prices he said are rising three times 
faster than inflation 
pryor said that while large purchasers such as hospitals have 
negotiated reduced prices for drugs manufacturers have resisted 
similar arrangements with state medicaid systems and other 
government programs 
a report by the committees majority staff said manufacturers 
have waged an allout national campaign to undermine and 
frustrate state efforts to negotiate lower prices for 
therapeutically interchangeable drugs 
it also said drug companies cite their research budgets as a 
justification for high prices but pour a big share of that money 
into developing socalled me too drugs that largely duplicate 
medications already on the market 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association sent pryor a report 
disputing that point and maintaining that the industrys research 
produces significant new compounds that improve existing 
therapies and drive down the overall cost of medical care 
officials from several major drug companies declined to testify 
at the hearing citing the proprietary nature of their pricing 
decisions 
the belgian consumers association an independent institute 
that conducts tests and surveys compared prices for 25 drugs in 
the united states and europe and reported to the committee that 
prices in the united states averaged 54 percent higher 
derek hodel executive director of the people with aids health 
group in new york told the committee us drug companies charge 
exhorbitant prices for desperately needed drugs 
he cited the case of aerosol pentamidine used to treat 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia the leading cause of death among 
people with aids the drug retails for approximately 150 in the 
united states while its equivalent sells for 26 in england hodel 
said 
because of the high us price many of those in need of this 
treatment simply do without hodel said others seek to import 
the drug from abroad he said 
sen john heinz rpa said the elderly are particularly 
vulnerable to rising drug prices because more than half have no 
insurance coverage for prescriptions 
when its all over people often decide theyre going to go 
without the drugs they because they cant afford it heinz said 
jake green 75 of winchester ky told the panel his costs for 
a months supply of mestinon to treat the neuromuscular disease 
myasthenia gravis have risen from 40 in january to 94 next month 
through a discount pill bank at a pharmacy the cost would be 
136 he said 
to be honest with you i fear the day when i will not be able 
to afford to purchase the medicine which is keeping me alive 
green said 
his concern was echoed by leona bivens 73 of seal beach 
calif who has parkinsons disease and a yearly drug bill of about 
3500 
i thought i had a good retirement plan but how long can i pay 
the druggists bill she asked

cosmetics queen estee lauder opened the doors 
thursday of a chic boutique filled with her pricey line of makeup 
and perfumes but there was some question about whether soviet 
women had enough dollars for her scents 
company officials said they would sell ordinary soviet women 
americanstyle cosmetics at americansized prices a tall challenge 
in a nation where the average soviet salary rarely tops 245 a 
month 
a tube of lipstick can go for 15 in new york a quarter ounce 
of the companys white linen perfume can sell for 55 
still there was no shortage of curious customers on opening day 
the ceremony on gorky street in the center of moscow two blocks 
from the kremlin attracted dozens of passersby who were kept 
behind police barricades as mrs lauder and nanouli shevardnadze 
the wife of soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze cut the 
ribbon 
welldressed soviet women later packed the shop the latest 
curiosity in a country that prides itself on its egalitarian 
principles 
mrs lauder told the crowd gathered outside the store that the 
women of moscow were already beautiful and we are going to keep 
every woman beautiful 
as an afterthought she added we are going to keep the men 
beautiful too with sales of mens after shaves and colognes 
company president leonard lauder said the company is selling its 
products for dollars to the moscow city council and the ussr 
ministry of trade which in turn are selling the cosmetics to 
soviets for rubles 
the shop itself is owned and operated by the city council and 
the ministry the soviet staff was trained by estee lauder 
personnel he said 
he said estee lauder products have been available in moscow for 
about 10 years but only in special shops for foreigners and joint 
ventures accepting only hard currency 
we want to sell to ordinary soviet people leonard lauder 
said we will charge about what you would pay in new york 
mrs lauder also said the prices would be about the same 
for tourists shopping at estee lauder will be a better deal at 
the official rate the ruble is worth 162 but under new 
regulations for tourists and other foreigners the cost of a ruble 
is only 16 cents which will make the estee lauder shop a bargain 
for foreigners 
thus for an american tourist eyeliner that costs 6 rubles 
could be purchased for the equivalent of 96 cents of course 
thats if the foreigner wanted to brave the long line 
mrs lauder said every woman and every man can come to my 
shop it doesnt cost much cosmetics go a long way she said 
the idea to open a shop for soviet people came during a visit by 
raisa gorbachev the wife of the soviet president to mrs lauder 
in new york during a trip in 1988 lauder officials said

residents of rongelap a tiny pacific atoll 
contended thursday that their island remains unsafe nearly four 
decades after the us government tested a nuclear bomb in the area 
the rongelap people wish to return home said jeton anjain 
who respresents the rongelapese in the marshall islands government 
however we will only return home if rongelap atoll is determined 
to be safe 
such a determination could be made only through a comprehensive 
radiological survey of the atoll which has not been done since the 
socalled bravo test irradiated the area in 1954 he told a 
house interior subcommittee hearing 
the reagan and bush administrations have contended that rongelap 
is safe for habitation roughly 350 rongelapese concerned about 
incidents of leukemia and tyroid cancer evacuated the island in 
1985 to live on mejato another island 
anjain said the energy department believes the rongelapese 
should return to their home island despite the fact that the 
rongelap environment today is highly contaminated with radiation 
nonvoting delegate ron de lugo dvi and the chairman of the 
insular and international affairs subcommittee said that although 
government officials have used a 1982 study to back up claims 
rongelap is safe the report realy made no such finding 
but bush administration officials said they would spend the next 
six months reviewing the literature and studies on rongelap 
the sixmonth review requested by the energy department will 
conduct an internal review of how the agency reached its present 
position on the issue of safety and habitability on rongelap 
said stella guerra the assistant secretary of interior 
the department of interior shares the desire of the energy 
secretary to ensure that all health and environmental impacts and 
the concerns of the rongelap people have been properly 
addressed she said in prepared remarks 
rongelap is part of the marshall islands a former us trust 
territory the islands now have a commonwealth relationship with 
the united states under the compact of free association 
under the compact the united states agreed to pay nuclear test 
victims 150 million in exchange for the marshall islands giving up 
the claims of its citizens 
some of that money was used for an independent scientific review 
of the 1982 energy department report de lugo said information in 
the preliminary review completed in may 1988 appears to be 
troubling 
among other things de lugo said the review stated that 
rongelap may be safe for adults but more study is needed to 
determine if children are safe 
the review also said people would have to mostly rely on 
imported food for 30 to 50 years

the national endowment for the arts reversed 
itself and returned a 10000 grant for a controversial aids art 
show just hours before its thursday night opening 
after consulting with members of the national council on the 
arts several of whom have also seen the show i have agreed to 
approve the request of artists space and will release the grant 
for the exhibition only nea chairman john e frohnmayer said in 
a statement 
the chairman on wednesday had visited the exhibit at the gallery 
artists space in lower manhattan after his quick tour he said 
there was a chance of reversal but added the part of the show 
ive had a chance to see lacked artistic merit 
the nea statement was released four hours before the opening of 
the show which has a total budget of 30000 the endowment said 
it will not fund the shows catalog which frohnmayer had called 
too political to merit federal support 
at the gallery the nea decision was hailed as a victory for the 
artists and the first amendment 
we won a battle but the war is still on the war against 
homophobia aids phobia and any undermining of our freedom of 
speech said nan goldin organizer of the exhibit witnesses 
against our vanishing 
susan wyatt museum executive director called it a great day 
weve got a great show opening 
the show includes paintings photographs and sculptures by 23 
artists depicting the effect of the aids epidemic on the artistic 
community 
some of the works are sexually explicit and the catalog 
contains derogatory references to cardinal john oconnor 
archbishop of the new york archdiocese and to lawmakers who 
supported a law restricting funding of art deemed obscene 
the endowment had approved a grant in may for the show but 
since then congress passed the law on art deemed obscene 
the nea said earlier this month it would withdraw support 
frohnmayer said the shows content differed from what its grant 
application said and that it lacked artistic merit 
goldin said thursday that regardless of the neas final 
decision she wants frohnmayer to resign 
it seems hes playing to the people with the most influence 
she said but the show has gotten the attention it deserves its 
too bad it had to be this way 
she said the dispute reflected the controversy over how to deal 
with the epidemic supporters of the law restricting support of the 
arts are the same people who think that aids victims should be 
quarantined she said

hundreds more egyptian workers arrived by 
plane from iraq on thursday while authorities investigated why 
scores of the workers have died and more than 22000 have returned 
in recent weeks officials said 
some workers said they were mistreated or lost their jobs to 
iraqi veterans who returned to civilian life since the eightyear 
iraniraq war ended in a ceasefire in august last year 
egyptian workers numbering about 2 million by iraqi count and 
thus the largest foreign work force have been hardhit by postwar 
shifts in iraqs economy 
an airport police officer said more than 600 workers arrived 
thursday on two iraqi airways and one egyptair flights with a 
dozen additional flights expected the rest of the day 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 22000 
egyptian workers returned from iraq through wednesday since the 
first of the month others went from iraq to other arab countries 
like jordan or kuwait but he said he did not know how many 
officials at cairo international airports cargo department said 
50 egyptian corpses arrived from iraq this month they said iraqi 
certificates with them indicated violent deaths in most cases but 
refused to give details 
a senior security official at the airport said monday that about 
100 bodies arrived last month cargo officials said the rate in 
months preceding the stillunexplained crisis ranged at 10 to 15 a 
month 
egypt has ordered an investigation into the death rate and the 
worker exodus on wednesday it set up a special committee to 
monitor the situation at the airport and report directly to prime 
minister atef sedki 
the problem will be thrashed out at a meeting in cairo next 
weekend of an iraqiegyptian committee that convenes every six 
months to review bilateral relations sedki and iraqi deputy 
premier taha yassin ramadan cochair the committee 
iraqi president saddam hussein on wednesday denied that 
egyptians are being killed maliciously and promised an 
investigation of claims that they are being illtreated 
he conceded some may have died in quarrels whether with 
iraqis or among themselves but said the number of deaths was not 
alarming considering the egyptian population in his country 
interviews with egyptian returnees on thursday showed they left 
because they were fired and could find no other jobs or because 
they could not tolerate insulting treatment by iraqi employers 
one worker attributed the violent deaths to frequent fights with 
iraqis and to highrisk jobs 
elsayed khalifa 30 a farmer who worked in construction or 
agriculture in iraq for the past five years said he left after 
demobilized iraqi soldiers came back from the front 
iraqi employers began treating me and other egyptians in an 
insulting way as though we had become a heavy burden all of a 
sudden he said 
construction worker sayed gomaa 35 who worked three years in 
iraq said some weeks ago a group of young iraqis who were just 
out of the military appeared and demanded work so the contractor 
simply fired me 
carpenter gomaa darwish 23 attributed the deaths to two main 
causes one frequent quarrels with jealous jobseeking iraqis 
in which firearms and knives sometimes were used two the hazards 
facing many thousands of egyptian construction workers trying to 
make more money they work overtime and many overworked laborers 
fall from scaffolds or die in other accidents 
several of those interviewed complained of salary reductions of 
as much as 50 percent as well as delays and cutbacks in remittances 
to their families in egypt

that whipped through the heart of the city in a flash leaving at 
least 17 people dead and hundreds homeless 
everybody was screaming and windows started breaking and the 
roof started to fall recalled vincent davis a fourthgrader at 
jones valley elementary school the whole top story flew off

injuries five of about 30 children in a kindergarten class also 
were reported hurt 
lynn culpepper was in his bathtub at the waterford square 
apartments where at least a dozen buildings were destroyed the 
next thing i knew glass was breaking and i was rolling on the 
ground he recalled 
it was just black and then there was this tumbling feeling 
with debris flying around everywhere when i opened my eyes and 
looked around there was just a pile of rubble where the apartments 
used to be 
culpeppers head and arms were cut in the collapse 
manager bob husman of a golbro jewelry store ordered employees 
into the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down on 
him 20 feet from the vault 
in the jewelry business the vault is the safest place he 
said i had structural steel on me but managed to crawl out it 
was the worst kind of nightmare 
the employees in the vault were dug out an hour after the 
collapse shaken but not hurt 
rick snider was in the bakery aisle of a supermarket 
part of the roof was coming off he said some ladies were 
crying but it was quite calm a checkout lady was hit with a cash 
register people were shouting can i help and they were leading 
people to the light there was no screaming or hysterical stuff i 
came out and i couldnt believe the damage 
for ed rolan a medic the devastation brought back memories of 
vietnam rolan who was driving home when the tornado hit went 
right to work helping the stricken motorists around him 
one lady was thrown from her car and i thought she was dead 
he said i came back by her later and saw she had changed 
positions it took 30 minutes to get a stretcher to her 
the enormity of the death and destruction sank in very 
quickly rolan said this is the closest to death i have been 
since vietnam

the network of radio talk show hosts credited with 
defeating an effort to raise congressmens pay says it was caught 
off guard when the house sped toward another salary increase but 
its mobilizing for the debate in the senate 
sparked by consumer advocate ralph nader radio talk show hosts 
around the country began a rush thursday to urge listeners to 
revolt and fast the senate could vote on raises friday 
one of the biggest complaints of the talk show hosts was the way 
the latest effort took by surprise those who earlier this year were 
deemed instrumental in killing a pay raise 
mostly the response weve been hearing is about the process 
about getting it done in a couple of days nobody really knew about 
it and they perceive it as a scheme on the part of leadership that 
leadership is in the tank said jerry williams the talkmaster 
at boston station wrko who helped spearhead a campaign against the 
last congressional pay raise plan which included a deluge of 
teabags sent to capitol hill 
williams said nader notified him of the quick proposal and vote 
in the house 
its just a backroom political deal that they are ramrodding 
through in the dark of night said mike siegel of king in 
seattle it flies in the face of everything in the system they 
announced it one day and voted on it the next day without any 
chance for public discussion 
siegel said there were a few actions that should have been taken 
before any raise was considered 
there should have been no raise of any kind considered until 
there is a statute eliminating the honoraria he said and they 
should have included a statute that the raises take effect with the 
next congressional session 
but since the house on thursday approved a plan that would raise 
pay from 89500 to 120000 within less than 14 months williams 
seigel and their broadcasting cohorts have begun focusing attention 
on the senate where debate will continue 
it will be a little easier for people to respond because they 
dont have to respond to so many lawmakers there are only two 
senators in their state williams said who began thursdays 
program by giving out the washington phone numbers of senate 
leaders 
all these folks in congress say they are having trouble 
attracting new blood well i dont think they will have any 
problem now said tom leykis of kfi in los angeles 
next year a week before election day i will read out loud 
the names of everyone who voted for the pay raise every day and 
make sure they get new blood in there he said if thats what 
they want the pay raise then thats what they are going to get 
wjno in west palm fla held a battle of the talk show 
hosts thursday with four hosts on the air at once 
congressmen should not be paid so much that they are making 
five times what the average wage earner takes home said jack 
cole who said his local listeners were about 80 percent against 
the raise

the aflcio declined thursday to take a stand 
on abortion an issue which split labor leaders on the final day of 
a convention dedicated to union unity 
though prochoice oratory dominated the final session the 
convention put aside for study a halfdozen resolutions calling 
upon the union to embrace in one way or another the stance taken 
by most of its political allies including the democratic party and 
various womens and civil rights groups 
the fourday gathering was highlighted by the appearance of 
polish solidarity leader lech walesa and a number of rowdy 
demonstrations to promote labor unity in several major strikes 
labor traditionally has steered clear of the abortion issue and 
had any of the resolutions come up for a vote it was likely that 
the federations older predominantly male leaders could have 
mustered the strength to defeat them 
aflcio president lane kirkland himself said two months ago that 
he did not believe the federation should take a stand on abortion 
kirkland and other leaders struck a deal with the prochoice 
sponsors to allow for the speechmaking and then refer the 
resolutions to the federations executive council 
we did not choose this issue said susan cowell vice 
president of the international ladies garment workers union and a 
leading member of a small but vocal group of women labor activists 
the reagan courts have forced us to take a stand on this issue 
the labor movement must choose sides and lead as we always 
have 
nine delegates including two men spoke in favor of adopting 
prochoice positions although no one spoke against the proposals 
the socially conservative leaders of the federations building 
trades unions remain opposed and wield considerable power on the 
executive council 
still several influential council members interviewed this week 
predicted the 33member board would endorse a womans right to 
choose to have an abortion if it could agree on language 
acknowledging moral and religious concerns the sponsors of the 
prochoice resolutions urged the council to act by its february 
meeting a decision then could determine whether labor makes the 
issue a factor in its support of 1990 political candidates 
let us now be in the vanguard regarding the rights of our 
women said arlene collins of the oregon aflcio the first state 
federation to adopt a prochoice platform the elections of the 
past few days have proven that prochoice is not divisive but a 
winner she said referring to victories by prochoice candidates 
in the new jersey and virginia gubernatorial races a week ago 
it is working women poor women who will pay with their lives 
and their futures is we sit by and government interferes said 
mary butz of the sacramento calif central labor council 
the labor movement has longstanding ties to the catholic church 
and some opponents of the prochoice resolutions have said 
privately that taking such a stance could hurt union organizing 
among bluecollar catholics

the settled prosperous nations of 
western europe have been stunned by developments in the suddenly 
rambunctious east and are avidly seeking a common strategy of 
response 
president francois mitterrand of france quickly arranged a 
summit scheduled for saturday of the 12 european community 
nations to discuss the rapid change in eastern europe 
it is crucially important that the european community should 
have a meeting of minds on it said peter ludlow director of the 
center for european policy studies a think tank based in brussels 
if ever we ought to seek common interest its here 
the paris summit comes two weeks before a meeting between 
president bush and president mikhail s gorbachev at which eastern 
europe also is certain to be a major topic 
a conference of the 12 leaders will allow western europe to 
make a contribution not after the event but before said an ec 
official speaking privately 
some in western europe worry that the unexpected events in the 
soviet bloc especially east germany could derail the communitys 
plans to create a single market of 320 million consumers in late 
1992 
by that date the dozen nations want to abolish the many trade 
barriers that obstruct the free flow of money people goods and 
services 
west germanys economy thirdlargest in the world overshadows 
those of the other community members giving it a powerful role in 
the campaign for a continental market 
the recent opening of east germanys borders raises the 
possibility of german reunification after 40 years of division 
however and could distract west germany from the common market 
goal 
stephen king international economist at james capel and co in 
london said the pace of integration may well be slowed to some 
extent west germany must be more interested in looking toward the 
east and may devote less political and economic resources to 
the european community 
officials of the european community say it must be strong to 
respond effectively to the uncertain events in the east 
jacques delors president of the communitys executive body and 
a driving force in the 1992 project has pressed for a more rapid 
pace toward unity 
in support of delors position the ec official said quicker 
integration is necessary to avoid dilution or weakening of the 
community the necessity to strengthen the community becomes 
apparent 
ludlow director of the brussels think tank said youve got 
to go faster on western european integration in order to stabilize 
the eastern situation 
west german officials mindful of the concerns of their allies 
have reaffirmed their ties to the west in recent days 
we have decided for europe and we are an integrated part of 
europe said peter pietsch an economist at the commerzbank in 
frankfurt nothing will change in this respect the process of 
european integration will not be affected 
a senior dutch official said privately west germany has made 
clear that there is no such choice between the common market and 
reunification and that is an encouraging signal 
the communitys toughest and most controversial task in coming 
months will be forging an economic and monetary union 
france wants a common currency and central bank system 
eventually but prime minister margaret thatcher of britain fears 
that would force member nations to relinquish some sovereignty to 
new institutions some west german officials favor a slower 
approach than the french 
according to the dutch official the germans feel slightly 
cornered if they hesitate on monetary union they will be 
accused of not participating in european integration 
western europe as a body has had limited experience of economic 
dealings with the east 
in june 1988 the community signed a declaration establishing 
official relations with the sovietled economic bloc known as 
comecon but nothing came of it 
since then the common market has worked out broad trade and 
economic cooperation agreements with poland and hungary and a more 
limited one with czechoslovakia negotiations are under way with 
the soviet union and preliminary but not formal talks have been 
held with east germany 
two dozen western nations also have put the community in charge 
of developing an overall economic package for poland and hungary 
which are moving toward democracy and free economies 
because of the closer ties there is talk of a form of associate 
ec membership for some east european countries

president fw de klerk on 
thursday opened all beaches to blacks and promised to end racial 
segregation of public facilities activist groups pressed him to 
scrap apartheid completely 
the time has arrived to repeal this act de klerk said 
referring to the separate amenities act that his national party put 
into law in 1953 
the act allows white local governments across the country to bar 
blacks from parks libraries swimming pools civic centers buses 
and public toilets 
it cannot be repealed formally until parliament reconvenes feb 
2 de klerks declaration that all beaches will be open also 
requires action by municipal and provincial authorities 
in many communities most or all public amenities are open to 
all races but whitesonly facilities persist in the capital 
pretoria in many rural towns and in several small industrial 
cities where the farright conservative party took power in 
municipal elections last year 
the proposed repeal of the separate amenities act is the 
beginning of the end of a separate white community life said 
koos van der merwe chief spokesman for the conservatives who 
urged whites to oust de klerk 
mr de klerk is placing south africa on the road of a totally 
racially mixed south africa which will inevitably be governed by a 
black majority 
antiapartheid groups urged de klerk to grant more freedoms to 
blacks lawyers for human rights said in a statement we hope 
that this is the first step under mr de klerk towards absolute 
equality for all people in south africa and the restoration and 
protection of many other rights which remain violated in terms of 
south african law 
the democratic movement a loose organization of antiapartheid 
groups said de klerk had no choice but to ease the restrictions 
and criticized his gradual approach of granting reforms 
when the president announced that blacks and whites can swim 
together he does so not from a position of moral strength but as 
someone put on the defensive by historical imperatives it said 
in a statement 
it said that the incrementalist approach of mr de klerks has 
built into it the elements of a holding act on behalf of a system 
which must just be scrapped altogether and not reformed 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we sincerely hope that the south african government will 
continue on this encouraging path 
the repeal would still leave major areas of segregation in south 
africa residential neighborhoods medical care and public 
education it also would leave intact the political system that 
gives the 5 million whites domination over the 32 million blacks 
asians and people of mixedrace 
the government is in the process of designating certain 
neighborhoods as multiracial although it says whites will retain 
the option of living in segregated areas 
de klerk has given no signal that public schools and hospitals 
will be integrated nor hinted at repeal of the population 
registration act which officially classifies all south africans by 
race 
de klerk who took office in august said his announcements were 
in line with our stated goal to eliminate discrimination 
they were the latest in a series of moves aimed at enhancing the 
prospects for blackwhite negotiations on a new constitution that 
would extend political rights to blacks while protecting white 
interests 
among these moves 
eight prominent political prisoners including seven leaders 
of the outlawed african national congress were freed 
unconditionally on oct 15 
for the first time in years the government has allowed mass 
demonstrations and marches by antiapartheid activists 
de klerk and other officials have sharply increased government 
contacts with opposition leaders holding meetings with nationally 
known and local activists 
further de klerk has visited neighboring black nations and it 
is widely believed that he will free nelson mandela the jailed 
leader of the anc earlier next year 
for the white group clinging to power means accepting the 
risk of more than that of facing a revolution de klerk said 
many beaches have been opened to all races in recent years but 
segregated beachfronts remain in the countrys main resort city 
durban and several smaller resort communities 
durbans city council recently voted down a proposal to 
integrate its last three whitesonly beaches but removed the 
whitesonly warning signs 
durban mayor derek watterson said he doubted de klerk had the 
authority to overturn the municipal law segregating city beaches 
but was pleased with the presidents statement and had placed the 
issue on the city council agenda for monday 
chris hattingh mayor of the strand near cape town where 
police used whips to drive black and mixedrace people off the 
citys beaches in late july said he was happy about de klerks 
statement and the council would address the issue friday

thousands of festive people strutted on the 
san franciscooakland bay bridge today commemorating the quick 
repair job that will enable commuters to return to the span this 
week for the first time since the earthquake 
celebrators paid 5 proceeds to quake relief to walk over 
the bridge to within 100 yards of the 50foot break on the upper 
deck that had severed the vital link between san francisco and the 
east bay on oct 17 one motorist died 
they couldnt walk all the way across because some of the 
concrete was still in the final stages of hardening officials said 
i was on a bus when the bridge broke about 150 yards from 
where it broke recalled susan palumbo 42 of san francisco as 
she stood on the bridge today we had to get off the bus and walk 
to treasure island and then to san francisco 
it was scary i didnt feel the quake but i waited for the 
aftershock to take the bridge down i feel safe now she said 
the 53yearold bridge one of the worlds most heavily 
traveled is scheduled to reopen at 1159 pm friday said bob 
halligan of the california department of transportation 
gov george deukmejian and mayors art agnos and lionel wilson of 
san francisco and oakland respectively were among the dignitaries 
on the program for todays ceremony near the site of the collapse 
in the early stages of the repair state department of 
transportation officials said they hoped to have the bridge 
reopened by thanksgiving denny mcleod a contractor said planning 
alone for such a job usually would take a month 
samuel skinner the us secretary of transportation 
congratulated caltrans after observing the final stages of repair 
work on tuesday and said weve beaten the bureaucracy on this 
one 
some local officials grumbled about todays ceremony saying the 
bridge could have been opened to cars today insteady of saturday 
officials expect the usual traffic backups come monday morning 
when motorists pay their 1 tolls to cross 
in recent weeks damage has been detected in many of the approach 
ramps on either side of the bridge so delays arent likely to end 
there are going to be tremendous traffic problems for at least 
a year because of earthquake damage said state assemblyman tom 
bates of oakland it seems like an excellent time to get 
reliable timely public transportation in place 
bates plans to call for a toll increase to at least 2 when 
the legislature reconvenes in january 
the bridge was carrying an average of more than 260000 vehicles 
every working day before the quake it opened on nov 12 1936 
in the past month commuters who normally drove the bridge to 
work had to use alternate routes longer and much slower because of 
increased traffic 
the bay area rapid transit system which has an underground tube 
below the bay has set records during the bridge closure with as 
many as 345000 passengers riding bart trains some days 
for the bridge repair the first step was to make sure the 
damaged decks didnt fall through to the bay working around the 
clock crews cut the damaged upper deck into two pieces then used 
a crane to lower them to a barge below 
other steps involved installing new girders placing 20 new 
ibeams lowering 42 precast deck sections and pouring concrete 
between them 
skinner said he hoped people who used mass transit during the 
closure would stick with it 
the nation cant afford the single occupant vehicle he said

lawmakers questioned eligibility rules for the 
nations 19 billionayear disability insurance program thursday 
after a congressional study found that many people being rejected 
are often in as bad shape as those receiving benefits 
more than half of a sample of applicants denied benefits under 
the social security disability insurance program are not working 
80 percent perceive their health as fair to poor and 61 percent 
had total family income below the census bureaus poverty level 
according to the general accounting office study 
among those rejected according to a supplement to the study 
prepared by the senate special committee on aging was a man 
disabled when a steel beam fell on him during a welding accident in 
1979 
dale white 54 of carlisle pa told the studys researchers 
that he limps can only walk short distances lost sight in one 
eye can lift only small objects and has difficulty concentrating 
for more than 10 minutes at a time but according to the 
supplement white was told that since he has two good arms and 
can lift small objects he could put nuts and bolts in a factory 
or he could be a security guard 
gao the investigative arm of congress asked the census bureau 
to interview 3000 people who either were recipients or former 
recipients of disability benefits in 1987 or whose applications 
were turned down 
about 1 million people apply each year for benefits under ssdi 
and about 30 percent are awarded benefits the program which paid 
more than 19 billion to 4 million beneficiaries in the last fiscal 
year is the nations main source of income replacement for 
disabled workers 
the survey results on the surface appear to raise some 
questions as to the accuracy of the social security 
administrations disability criteria and determination process in 
judging a disability applicants ability to work said the ga0 
a significant proportion of denied applicants were not 
working and their selfreported health limitations appeared to be 
similar to those of program beneficiaries it said 
the study was requested by sen john heinz rpa ranking 
minority member of the senate aging committee and rep andrew 
jacobs dind chairman of the house ways and means subcommittee 
on social security 
jacobs and heinz said after the study was released thursday that 
the programs eligibility standards should be reviewed 
to qualify for benefits a person insured under social security 
must be unable to perform any kind of substantial gainful 
activity that exists in the national economy according to the 
gao the social security administration has developed a list of 
impairments for example blindness considered severe enough to 
automatically warrant benefits 
mental and heart problems were the most common ailments among 
those receiving benefits the gao said the report said the 
rejected applicants most often reported back problems 
social security administration spokesman phil gambino said the 
agency is considering personal interviews with applicants he said 
administrator gwendolyn king vowed when she assumed the post 
earlier this year to promote fairness equity and responsiveness 
through all our policies practices and decisions in the disability 
program

the nations governors and the president of 
the american federation of teachers gave conditional support 
thursday to a bill that would allow schools more flexibility in 
exchange for improved learning by students 
i know some people fear change new jersey gov thomas h 
kean told a subcommittee of the house education and labor committee 
providing a quality education today entails taking risks 
this bill commits school districts to higher academic achievement 
in return for flexibility in dealing with federal and state 
regulations said kean its a trade of professional freedom 
for accountability 
the bill introduced by rep peter smith rvt would make the 
program voluntary and stipulate that participation would be 
canceled if student achievements worsen within two years 
kean submitted a statement from the national governors 
association that praised the concept and policy direction of 
the legislation but said the measure needs more work in clearly 
stating the financing and monitoring arrangements 
aft president albert shanker stressed that the performance goals 
should be clearly defined as well as how achievements will be 
assessed 
but shanker added i think the overall framework of getting 
people at the local level to come up with some new ideas and 
planning getting commitment on the part of all the constitutents 
combining sums of money i think the entire framework is 
excellent 
opposing the bill the committee chairman rep augustus 
hawkins dcalif told the hearing by the subcommittee on 
elementary secondary and vocational education that the measure may 
set a dangerous trend he reminded committee members of the 
initial problems with the federal chapter one program for 
disadvantaged children 
we found that chapter one was being expended even though it 
was getting positive results for football fields for swimming 
pools for faculty lounges and so forth and not for the academic 
improvement of the children said hawkins so we had to come 
back 15 to 20 times and insert protections in the law 
hawkins also noted that congress got involved in education 
because of the neglect that we found 
we had to legislate to get handicapped kids into the 
classroom we had to legislate on the federal level to get 
disadvantaged children who were picking crops back into the 
classroom weve had to go through this process it worries me what 
regulations are going to be suspended or altered he said 
smith an educator and former vermont lieutenant governor 
introduced the bill days before the historic education summit that 
concluded with an agreement that national performance goals would 
be developed and federal regulations tied to key education programs 
would be loosened 
the summit and the attention it commanded have given us an 
extraordinary opportunity here in congress to work with the 
administration and the governors toward a national policy that will 
restructure our public school system for the better smith told 
the subcommittee 
smith said the bill was written in direct response to complaints 
of educators that quality education has suffered as government 
rules and regulations have stiffened 
it is offered as both a solution and a challenge because it 
basically says to our educators if you can do better with fewer 
rules and regulations prove it he said 
smith said the bill also stresses that the civil rights of 
students in no way shape or form can be abridged

to police headquarters no arrests were reported in either incident 
the congress of south african trade unions with which the 
transport union is affiliated said police indiscriminately 
attacked the workers when they got off the train without paying 
the statement by the congress the countrys largest and most 
militantly antiapartheid trade federation said police brutally 
assaulted the strikers when they fled to the union offices the 
union said the workers were unable to pay for their train tickets 
because they were on strike 
the dispute centers on a demand by the south african railways 
and harbor workers for the minimum wage to be increased to 570 a 
month from 230 other issues in dispute are the unions objection 
to possible privatization and the companys refusal to officially 
recognize the union 
the union claims a membership of 40000 of the total 180000 
black workers employed by the transport company 
the strike which has hit mainly the johannesburgpretoria area 
and the port city of durban is one of two bitter labor disputes 
that show no signs of resolution 
about 6000 black employees of south african breweries the 
countrys privately owned beer monopoly have been on strike for 
five weeks 
on wednesday the brewery workers union lowered its wage demand 
for the first time saying it would accept a 32 percent increase 
instead of a 38 percent increase but management maintained its 
refusal to change its final offer of a 16 percent raise 
seven deaths have been linked to that strike 
police officials also said thursday that 15 black activists were 
arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in alexandra a 
township adjoining johannesburg the meeting followed the 
announcement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission for 
a protest march in alexandra on saturday 
organizers hoped 30000 would join the march to demand new 
housing an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accrued 
during a threeyear rent boycott

members of congress are warning president bush 
that reported plans to slash federal support for such 
hightechnology initiatives as robots and advanced computer chips 
would be economic insanity and doom americas consumer 
electronics industry 
eliminating americas few strategic technology initiatives 
will cause permanent damage to both our defense and commercial 
industrial bases said a bipartisan group of four legislators in 
a letter sent to bush late wednesday 
white house spokesman steven hart had no comment on the letter 
which said bush administration officials are circulating documents 
that call for drastically reducing contracts and programs of the 
defense advanced research projects agency 
the programs they said include highdefinition television 
known as hdtv and xray lithography a technology needed to make 
advanced computer chips 
they also include the defense departments manufacturing 
technology program which is aimed at developing robots and other 
computerassisted equipment 
the letter said the administration also is reported to be 
considering a cutoff of support for sematech an 
industrygovernment consortium that aims to regain us leadership 
in semiconductor manufacturing by 1993 sematech receives 100 
million annually from the government 
cutting if not completely eliminating any of the programs in 
question would be economic insanity said the letter signed by 
sen john heinz rpa house majority leader richard a gephardt 
dmo and democratic reps mel levine and norman y mineta of 
california 
sen albert gore jr dtenn chairman of the senate commerce 
subcommittee on science technology and space also criticized the 
reported cutbacks thursday in a separate letter to bush 
i find it hard to believe that you would personally 
countenance actions so shortsighted and so damaging gore wrote 
gore wrote his senate colleagues a letter saying he had been 
informed that orders have been given to terminate all work in the 
defense department on hdtv and that the defense department should 
now prepare to rely upon the japanese as suppliers for our 
militarys needs in this field 
the tennessee democrat said he also heard that ideologists 
are urging the administration to cancel sematech and other 
consortia that bring the federal government into cooperation with 
the private sector on critical technological work 
if this happens gore wrote the administration will have 
sanctioned and encouraged the complete and irrevocable demise of 
the american consumer electronics industry and signaled that it 
also intends to allow the machine tool industry already badly 
damaged by foreign competition to suffer a similar fate 
gores letter to bush dated nov 1 accompanied a report by the 
national advisory committee on semiconductors which the white 
house has not released 
in the letter the advisory committees chairman ian m ross 
president of atampt bell laboratories contended that the 
semiconductor industry in the united states is in serious trouble 
ross told bush that if this vital industry is allowed to 
wither away the nation will pay a price measured in millions of 
jobs across the entire electronics field technological leadership 
in many allied industries such as telecommunications and computers 
and the technical edge we depend on for national security

describing socialism as a total 
failure chancellor helmut kohl said thursday the east germans 
must decide for themselves whether to unite with west germany 
the soviet union is firmly opposed to german reunification and 
some western countries are nervous about the idea 
but kohl told a raucous parliamentary session that the east 
germans should be allowed to make up their own minds 
they dont need any lectures from one side or another they 
know best what they want that pertains also to german unity to 
the question of reunification he said 
parliament erupted into a verbal freeforall as lawmakers and 
officials from kohls governing coalition exchanged barbs with the 
opposition about kohls responses to events in east germany 
following the opening of the communist countrys borders and a 
series of other reforms 
the chancellor said west germany would respect every decision 
made by the people of the german democratic republic east germany 
in free selfdetermination 
kohl added he who does not want to make decisions for our 
people should not try to persuade them the best thing is a division 
of our fatherland 
he said west germanys call for sweeping economic reform in east 
germany was not an example of meddling but a recognition of 
disastrous results from communist rule 
we dont want to impose our ideas on anyone he said but 
no one can seriously dispute that socialism has proven itself to be 
a total failure everywhere in the world not just in the gdr east 
germany it has failed 
mikhail s gorbachev insists that sweeping changes in the 
communist world are not an admission that socialism was a mistake 
the soviet president also has warned the west not to gloat over 
what would seem like its victory in the cold war 
gorbachev on wednesday said talk about reunification would 
mean interference in the affairs of east germany and west germany 
on thursday soviet central committee adviser nikolai portugalov 
said reunification wont happen even in the longterm future 
reunification in the form in which certain rightists and 
nationalists in the federal republic west germany envision it 
doesnt fit in the concept of the german states neither east or 
west portugalov told the soviet news agency novosti 
therefore i think that for the forseeable future and also in 
the long term two german states will exist with one another not 
against one another as sovereign and equal 
west berlin mayor walter momper accused kohl of dragging his 
feet in offers of help for east germany and demanded that financial 
aid not be linked to a complete overhaul of the communist nations 
economy 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff interrupted momper and 
said to him angrily do you really think that in this hour of 
history your attack is really appropriate 
in his speech momper also said east germans want no meddling 
in the formation of their society and contended most arent 
interested in the question of german reunification 
renewed interest in possible german reunification has followed 
east germanys decision a week ago to open its borders including 
the berlin wall built in 1961 to prevent citizens from fleeing 
the wall was a symbol of eastwest division 
kohl offered to make desperately needed doctors and medical 
assistance available to east germany but said fundamental changes 
in its political and economic system remains crucial to bonns 
plans for a fully new dimension of help and cooperation

the general services administration is 
investigating international business machines corps sale to the 
government of used computer equipment marked as new gsa officials 
said thursday 
ibm says it told the gsa about the problems two years ago 
the investigation by the agencys inspector general is also 
trying to determine if ibm violated the buy american act by 
incorrectly certifying that more than half the components of some 
products it sold the government were made in america 
audits of three computer contacts each worth 700 million to 
800 million a year are being conducted by the inspector general 
of gsa officials told the house government operations national 
security subcommittee 
it appears that ibm has violated the terms of its contracts 
with the government and may have violated federal law assistant 
inspector general edward f hefferon told the subcommittee 
company spokesman mark holcomb said the company had no intention 
of trying to deceive the government and reported the problems to 
gsa two years ago 
discussion of criminal and administrative penalties is simply 
not appropriate to the facts he said there was simply no 
intent to deceive the government 
but investigators are reviewing the contracts to determine if 
there is any evidence of a willful intent by ibm to deceive the 
government said karen shaffer a spokeswoman for the inspector 
generals office 
if we find something that warrants civil or criminal action 
we refer it to the justice department and they make the case she 
said 
no referrals have been made to the justice department but the 
investigation is continuing she said 
holcomb said the false certification that some of the products 
were new was inadvertent and the result of a computer program error 
the sale of used equipment or products largely made with foreign 
components accounted for only a small percentage of the three 
contracts which ran from 1984 through 1988 he said 
used equipment sold to the government had been reconditioned and 
worked as if it were new holcomb said ibm offered to pay 15 
million to cover penalties for selling used equipment to the 
government 
hefferon said gsa auditors are looking at the three contracts 
so that we can assure ourselves that all sales transactions were 
adequately considered 
no settlement will be considered until all the facts 
surrounding this situation have been carefully developed and 
reviewed hefferon said 
a customers query led to ibms discovery that it couldnt 
certify that some of the products sold the government were 
domesticend use as required by the buy american act holcomb 
said 
with the growth of worldwide sources of computer components 
it is increasingly difficult for venders to certify country of 
origin holcomb said we went back and looked at the process 
that was used to track the literally billions of components that go 
into primary lowend products such as printers and work stations 
we did not have enough information in some cases to be able to 
certify that half the parts were usmade holcomb said when 
we found that in our own internal review we disclosed it to gsa 
hefferon said that ibm has been cooperating with the review and 
gsa has asked for additional information while some of this 
information has been furnished by ibm we are still waiting for a 
substantial portion of data 
our experience has been that ibm as a very large bureaucracy 
is very slow to respond hefferon said in general however 
they have maintained a cooperative attitude

gov mario cuomo plans a new book about 
abraham lincoln that will translate the gettysburg address so 
polish school children can learn about government of the people 
by the people and for the people 
instead of memorizing the words four score and seven years 
ago polish children may learn osiemdziesiat siedem lat temu 
 
cuomo was to announce plans for the book to be published in 
english and polish at a meeting friday with lech walesa at an 
aflciosponsored breakfast in new york city 
cuomo also planned to present a bust of lincoln to walesa 
founder of the polish labor union solidarity that brought sweeping 
democratic reforms to his country 
the unusual book project for which cuomo is writing an 
introduction stemmed from a visit this summer by a group of 
teachers from poland the first soviet bloc country in 40 years to 
hold free elections and form a noncommunist government 
they asked the governor how to teach their students about 
democracy and cuomo told them to study lincolns writings told by 
the teachers that there was no such work in polish cuomo promised 
to help correct that 
a day after he found out there was no such book in poland he 
found there was such book in this country either said cuomo aide 
harold holzer he thought we could just go out and buy the book 
and have it translated 
cuomo and holzer began rounding up lincoln scholars and money to 
produce such a book eventually said holzer more than 40 lincoln 
scholars volunteered their time seven are writing essays for the 
book 
polishborn poet and novelist czeslaw milosz winner of the 1980 
nobel prize for literature agreed to translate the gettysburg 
address into polish holzer is hoping that the state university of 
new york at stony brooks institute for translation will take care 
of the rest 
seed money for the project came from the new york telephone co 
the forbes foundation the american federation of teachers and the 
new york state united teachers 
the book will be published next november by cornelia and michael 
bessie books a division of harper amp row said editor amy gash 
the second chapter of what some cuomo aides have dubbed the 
lechlincoln connection comes sunday when the new york democrat 
goes to gettysburg pa to be the featured speaker at ceremonies 
marking the 126th anniversary of lincolns famous speech 
billing the governors own gettysburg address as a major speech 
holzer said it would deal with democracy in eastern europe and the 
question of who are the true heirs of lincoln the democrats or 
the republicans 
cuomos speech will come at the annual ceremony at the 
gettysburg cemetery dedicated by lincoln after the battle that 
what was the turning point of the civil war 
previous speakers have included poet carl sandburg and illinois 
gov james thompson last year us chief justice william 
rehnquist was the main speaker

president virgilio barcos government 
opposes an attempt in colombias congress to pardon drug 
traffickers newspapers reported thursday 
during debate in congress wednesday justice minister roberto 
salazar said barco is steadfastly opposed to giving amnesty to the 
medellin cartel members and other cocaine traffickers reported the 
dailies el espectador and el tiempo 
barco has no veto power over legislation and if the congress 
should decide to approve the amnesty bill it would become law 
however there is little doubt the supreme court would declare 
such a law unconstitutional the constitution clearly reserves 
pardons for political crimes while forbidding amnesty for common 
criminals 
rep cesar perez is proposing that amnesty for traffickers be 
made part of a bill that would offer amnesty to leftist guerrillas 
who signed a truce with the government 
perez said in a speech to the congress wednesday that the 
minister of justice was ignorant because of his opposition to 
amnesty for drug traffickers 
colombias congress has not been enthusiastic over the 
governments war on drug traffickers declared by barco aug 19 
after traffickers killed a popular presidential hopeful sen luis 
carlos galan 
barco issued decrees allowing the extradition of traffickers to 
the united states and the confiscation of their property in 
colombia 
attacks blamed on drug thugs since the government offensive 
began have left at least 39 people dead and 226 injured 
several members of congress have been accused in the last 10 
years of accepting money from drug traffickers but the accusations 
have never been proven the suspected head of the medellin cartel 
pablo escobar was a member of congress from 1982 to 1986 
several congressmen have expressed support for amnesty for drug 
traffickers but because most are keeping their opinions to 
themselves there is no way to tell if amnesty for traffickers might 
be approved 
debate on the bill is expected to end within the next two weeks 
the proposed amnesty for guerrillas came in a peace treaty with 
the april 19 movement known as the m19 few in congress have 
spoken out against the governments attempt to reach a peace with 
the guerrillas 
in exchange for pardons and the right to form a political party 
the m19 has agreed to give up its weapons and disband 
four other guerrilla groups have expressed interest in opening 
talks with the government but so far no other talks have taken 
place a sixth guerrilla group the national liberation army has 
said it will never negotiate with the government

here are some of the questions posed by the 
members of the senate armed services committee on thursday to navy 
officials who conducted the investigation into the april 19 
explosion aboard the battleship iowa and some of the replies they 
received 
does the navy have proof the explosion was caused by gunners 
mate clayton hartwig 
rear adm richard milligan author of the navys report said 
the navy has forensic evidence that hartwig was the gun captain 
on the day of the explosion and that he was the one who 
controlled the loading of the 16inch gun which was rammed 21 
inches further up the barrel than it should have been hartwig had 
the ability to construct an explosive device and the opportunity to 
put it in the gun the admiral said 
milligan cited as other evidence an fbi psychological profile of 
hartwig that he said suggested the sailor took his own life in 
hopes it would look like an accident 
but hartwig didnt know he was to be in the turret until 
several hours before the blast 
milligan said the sailor was upset over the breakup of a 
friendship with another sailor had discussed suicide and did have 
those hours of notice he noted that superiors who assigned hartwig 
to replace another sailor in the turret also died in the blast 
arent there other possible causes for such an explosion 
the admiral said his investigation and the navys 20000 
technical tests of the gunpowder and charge ruled out numerous 
other possibilties such as a spark from a burning ember or the 
ships electrical system friction during the loading of the gun 
barrel or contamination of the gunpowder during its years of 
storage 
could the foreign matter found on the projectile a key to 
the navys conclusion that someone probably used a detonator have 
gotten there at some other time 
milligan said the material was embedded in the copper ring of 
the projectile by the fierce power of the explosion and could not 
have gotten there when the shell was forcibly removed from the gun 
barrel following the explosion 
given the safety and training problems aboard the iowa 
couldnt they have played a part in the explosion 
milligan admitted that there were major problems in the 
administration of the ship and that the sailors in the gun turret 
had not completed the proper procedures to prove that they were 
competent to work in those positions but the admiral said those 
problems didnt cause the blast 
doesnt a recent series of deadly accidents give rise to doubts 
about the navys training and the leadership of its commanders 
the navys top admiral carlisle ah trost told the committee 
that steps have been taken to make sure that the lapses in 
procedure aboard the iowa have been corrected throughout the fleet 
and that he ordered a navywide safety inspection to make sure that 
proper procedures are being followed

has ownership rights to van goghs masterpiece the gardener

venice 
under the ruling by the administrative court of the province of 
lazio the 1889 oil painting valued at 85 million will remain at 
the national gallery of modern art in rome 
the ownership dispute dates to 1977 when ernst beyeler an art 
collector from basel switzerland bought the painting for 600 
million lire about 1 million then from an italian nobleman 
the painting remained in italian museums and beyeler tried to 
sell it last year to the guggenheim collection one of the most 
renowned modern art galleries in europe the sale price was 85 
million 
the italian culture ministry however blocked the sale it 
charged beyelers 1977 purchase of the painting was illegal saying 
it was bought in another persons name the ministry said beyeler 
was not the legal owner and that the government had rights to the 
painting 
beyeler took the case to court which ruled against him 
thursday the court will announce the reasons for its ruling later 
guggenheim officials were not involved in the court case 
the court ruling means the state can buy the painting at the 
1977 price now equivalent to 444000 however an official 
familiar with the case said another court could adjust the price 
for inflation putting the sales tag at about 15 million 
the painting has been in italy since 1910 and is considered by 
the government part of the countrys artistic patrimony 
in 1977 an attempt was made to illegally export the painting 
from italy 
the painting a halflength portrait of a peasant in a sun hat 
has been kept in the basement of the rome museum since 1987 pending 
clarification of its ownership

a state department official said thursday that 
us consular officials want to question the california woman who 
for a time was thought kidnapped by terrorists in lebanon 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said west german authorities had 
conveyed word that deborah fahrend and two west german citizens 
were free and safe 
we dont know for sure whether they were kidnapped miss 
tutwiler said they have told the germans that they were robbed 
not kidnapped 
reports from lebanon said the trio had gone by ferry to larnaca 
cyprus 
our consular officer wherever she surfaces will definitely 
want to have a little meet her said miss tutwiler ending her 
sentence on a different note 
she said that a privacy law prevented her from discussing mrs 
fahrends passport but she emphasized it is against the law to use 
a us passport to travel to lebanon without a special validation 
she said no american citizen to date has been prosecuted for 
such passport violations but there are a number of cases under 
consideration for prosecution right now 
after outlining what the state department knew of the fahrend 
case miss tutwiler added 
the lebanon travel advisory states that the situation in 
lebanon is so dangerous for americans that no us citizen can be 
considered safe from terrorist acts 
she noted that us embassy personnel were evacuated last sept 
6 and said without a special validation us passports remain 
invalid for travel to in or through lebanon 
lebanon and libya are the only two countries on which the united 
states has placed such stringent travel restrictions 
so far this year miss tutwiler said us officials have 
granted only 15 such passport validations for travel to wartorn 
lebanon it validates passports for journalists for red cross or 
humanitarian purposes or for trips in the us national 
interest she said 
mrs fahrend 54 had no connection with the us government

the government on thursday proposed voluntary 
recordkeeping standards for employers so workers get credit for 
all their wages when social security benefits are calculated 
it is simply unacceptable for anyone to receive less than 
their entitled social security benefits because their wages were 
at some point in their career improperly recorded social 
security commissioner gwendolyn king said 
the social security administration believes the new voluntary 
computer software standards could help employers more accurately 
report wage and tax information to ssa and the internal revenue 
service 
if an employee does not get proper credit for his or her wages 
it could result in lower social security benefits under the 
current system an estimated 10 percent of employer wage reports 
contain inaccuracies or discrepancies that government workers must 
try to resolve 
the general accounting office last year reported that between 
1978 and 1983 employers reported 588 billion less earnings to 
social security than to irs and that little was being done to 
reduce a growing backlog of unresolved cases 
social security spokesman phil gambino said all those cases have 
since been closed with differences successfully resolved in 
twothirds of them for 198487 about threefourths of problem 
cases have been resolved and all should be completed by next year 
he said 
the work has resulted in the crediting of 84 billion in wages 
for 197987 gambino said 
in recent years ssa has struggled mightily to attempt to 
reconcile these errors after the reporting fact mrs king said 
now we want to correct the problem at the employer level 
before differences occur 
employers are being asked to comment on the draft guidelines 
before a final version of the voluntary standards is issued 
workers themselves can help verify the accuracy of their 
earnings record by obtaining a personalized earnings and benefit 
estimate statement from social security which contains a 
yearbyyear display of their earnings from 1951 through the most 
recent year applications for the statements can be obtained by 
contacting local social security offices or by calling

engineers installed a borrowed 
electrical control unit in space shuttle discovery on thursday and 
nasa said it was proceeding on a tight schedule toward a 
thanksgiving eve launch 
discoverys five astronauts will deploy a classified pentagon 
satellite reportedly to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic 
communications 
the launch had been scheduled for next monday night but was 
postponed until wednesday after an electronic unit destined for 
another shuttle shorted out engineers blamed faulty wiring and 
decided to check all other such units 
in doing so nasa found a unit with suspect wiring in one of 
discoverys solid fuel booster rockets and replaced it with a unit 
taken from space shuttle columbia 
the unit routes all power commands and data between the 
spaceship and the boosters and commands the separation of the 
rockets after about two minutes of flight 
while the schedule is very tight we feel we can make a 
wednesday launching said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
because the flight is classified nasa and the pentagon have 
said only that the launch will occur between 630 pm and 1030 
pm they will not make the exact time public until just nine 
minutes before liftoff 
except for announcements on the landing day and time there will 
be a news blackout during the mission unless something major goes 
wrong 
the flight is expected to last four days

a bill that would allow the securities and 
exchange commission to halt trading during stock market emergencies 
with the presidents approval was passed by a senate committee 
thursday 
the proposed market reform act of 1989 would give the sec 
authority to take temporary emergency action in response to a major 
market disturbance 
but the president would be required to state that he does not 
disapprove of any action before it could take effect 
meanwhile house members were working to get a similar bill out 
of committee before congress adjourns for the holidays 
lawmakers are hoping to complete their work for the year by next 
wednesday and adjourn until january 
the house bill also would give the sec the power to curtail 
practices deemed manipulative or abusive including program 
trading during periods of high volatility 
that measure pending before the house energy and commerce 
committee went further than the pending senate bill the market 
reform act of 1989 
the senate bill which now goes to the full senate would give 
the sec the authority to 
halt trading during stock market emergencies like the crash of 
1987 or the 190point drop last month 
require large securities transactions to be reported 
require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and 
investment firms to verify their financial stability 
coordinate the clearance and settlement of stock option and 
future trades with the commodity futures trading commission the 
federal agency that oversees the futures markets 
the senate bill was introduced in march by sen christopher 
dodd dconn and sen john heinz rpenn at the request of the 
sec 
the bill seeks to prevent some of the problems that contributed 
to the stock market plunge in october 1987 
its absolutely critical that we pass this before we go 
dodd told the panel which approved the bill by a voice vote after 
leaders said they would oppose attempts to include amendements that 
would limit takeovers or leveraged buyouts 
heinz noted the bill had the strong support of the sec and the 
treasury department as well as most segments of the industry

the nuclear regulatory commission said 
thursday it would immediately move toward a decision on licensing 
the seabrook nh nuclear power plant 
in a threepage ruling the commission said it would take the 
case away from two lowerlevel boards who were disputing the 
adequacy of emergency evacuation plans for new hampshire residents 
living near the plant no timetable for action was announced 
rick bornemann spokesman for connecticuts united illuminating 
corp owner of the secondlargest share of the seabrook plant 
said anything that speeds up this outcome is good news 
opponents of seabrook meanwhile reacted angrily 
i am absolutely outraged said sen john kerry dmass i 
will ask for a speedup of the congressional investigation of nrc 
procedures that we called for this week 
the plant planned since the early 1970s was finished in 1986 
licensing and operation has been held up by disputes over the 
adequacy of emergency evaucation plans particularly for 
massachusetts communities near the plant 
the commission would have had to consider the action by the 
boards in any case and it is under no obligation to wait for the 
boards to complete their work 
the atomic safety and licensing board earlier this week 
dismissed a ruling by the atomic safety and licensing appeal board 
that questioned the effectiveness of the evacuation plans the 
licensing boards argument was that the concerns raised by the 
appeal board should not stand in the way of seabrook receiving a 
license 
until thursdays ruling the appeal board was preparing to open 
a twoweek process during which arguments on the evacuation plans 
would be heard 
in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness in resolving 
matters relating to the licensing boards authorization of the 
issuance of a fullpower license the commission has decided that 
it rather than the appeal board will consider all applications for 
a stay of the licensing boards authorization of fullpower 
operation the four commissioners said

a federal agency is denying charges by a 
group of earthquake victims who contend they arent getting the 
benefits they deserve 
outside a crumbling and boarded residential hotel the group 
wednesday presented a petition of grievances against the federal 
emergency management agency demanding parity for poorer victims of 
the oct 17 earthquake 
were outraged against this discriminatory action of fema 
said attorney kenneth zimmerman of the legal aid society of alameda 
county 
the group accused fema of violating its legal obligations to 
ease the burdens of quake victims 
zimmerman accused fema of granting lowincome tenants of 
residential hotels and seasonal workers a half to a third of the 
payments other renters are getting he charged also that the agency 
has labeled some people as preearthquake homeless when they 
had addresses before the quake 
lorri l jean femas deputy federal coordinating officer 
categorically denied the allegations she said the authors of the 
petition do not understand femas program and have not made an 
attempt to try and understand femas program 
she said longterm renters and homeowners get more money because 
it takes them more time to relocate them than residential hotel 
tenants 
those who need and qualify for help from fema and other 
organizations receive it now and will continue to receive it she 
said 
jean said that as of monday her agency paid out almost 63 
million in temporary housing aid and that the figure would soon 
double

corp 
they walked in they locked offices they locked desks

some smokers threw away their cigarettes but others kept 
nicotine flowing in their veins thursday as organizers of the 13th 
annual great american smokeout pressed americans to kick the habit 
newborns in new jersey were given im a born nonsmoker 
tshirts a national chain of restaurants offered cold turkey 
sandwiches for a halfpack of smokes and a hospital in maine gave 
out carrot sticks and gum to relieve the craving to light up 
the american cancer society the smokeout sponsor said it hoped 
that onefifth of the countrys 50 million smokers would give up 
smoking for at least 24 hours and that many of them would do so 
for good 
the more times you attempt to quit the more likely you are to 
be successful said kenneth a perkins an assistant professor of 
psychiatry at the university of pittsburgh who endorsed the 
smokeout concept 
darlene grinolds 58 of butte mont said said she began 
smoking when she was 9 last year she stayed off cigarettes for 
four months after the smokeout 
this year she hopes to make the ban permanent because im 
tired of being a slave 
steve malko of philadelphia took the opposite tack i dont 
want to quit i enjoy it he said ive told myself ill quit 
when im married and my wife gets pregnant now all i have to do is 
put off marriage 
maine marked smokeout day by putting into effect a strict ban on 
smoking in hospitals and many employers including the travelers 
insurance giant in hartford conn instituted similar bans for 
their workers 
osteopathic hospital in portland maine handed out carrot 
sticks and popcorn to quitting smokers along with about 150 
survival kits including sugarless gum sugarless candy 
crossword puzzles and anything to get them through the day 
said margaret smith office coordinator at the hospital 
in pittsburgh the subway sandwich and salad shop hung a sign 
saying leave the pack behind it was part of a nationwide 
promotion by the 1350restaurant chain inviting customers to trade 
a halfpack or more of cigarettes for a cold turkey sandwich 
some employers who believe smoking increases their health 
insurance and absenteeism costs offered even greater incentives 
cummings properties of woburn mass gave employees who pledged 
not to smoke during work hours 500 the money was offered even to 
those who have never picked up a cigarette in the first place 
seventytwo of the companys roughly 100 workers collected the 
cash 
james mckeown executive vice president of the real estate 
management company said giving out the grants to all nonsmokers 
was the only way not to be punitive to nonsmokers the best way 
to quit smoking is to never start 
smoking causes lung cancer heart disease and respiratory 
disease and can threaten newborns whose mothers smoked during 
pregnancy scientists say the surgeon general has warned of the 
risks of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine 
beth israel medical center in new york city which claims to be 
the first hospital to ban smoking from its grounds three years ago 
offered free tests of lung function to make smokers stop and think 
one smokeout participant across the river in new jersey had no

the solidarityled parliament passed a law 
thursday that reduces the sentences of many prisoners and suspends 
terms of those convicted of lesser crimes on the grounds the jail 
terms set by communist rulers were too severe 
the vote was 29319 with 61 abstentions among the supporters 
were many deputies of the solidarity trade union who were jailed 
for their opposition to communist rule 
the law covers crimes committed before sept 12 the day the 
460member parliament replaced a communist government with the 
administration of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a confidante 
of solidarity leader lech walesa 
it does not cover repeat offenders drunk drivers responsible 
for fatal accidents or those convicted of gang rape 
more than a dozen deputies took the floor during the debate 
most of the speakers were from the 161member solidarity caucus and 
most favored the law 
i was among those who had been sentenced i think the polish 
legal system should be less strict said solidarity deputy adam 
michnik who was released in 1986 after five years in jail 
the polish law is so strict and the sentences have been too 
severe the polish legal system has been rather repressive and the 
sentences unjust nobody should be excluded from the amnesty 
said eugeniusz ujas another solidarity deputy 
a television news program said it was the first amnesty for 
prisoners with long sentences since 1956 when prison terms were 
reduced for many inmates sentenced during the stalinist era in 
poland 
the amnesty is the first step in an expected overhaul of the 
penal code 
the law suspends sentences of those who received sentences of up 
to two years for common crimes and those who received sentences of 
up to three years for premeditated crimes 
the sentences must be reviewed by the court or prosecutor before 
the prisoners are released 
in the case of crimes carrying sentences of up to 10 years the 
terms will be reduced by half higher sentences are to be cut down 
by onethird while those carrying terms of 25 years will be 
reduced to 15 years 
those prisoners who received a death penalty will now serve 25 
years 
some of the opponents expressed concern that criminals would be 
released and let loose on society in polands difficult transition 
to democracy 
new crimes and prison sentences were introduced after the 
martiallaw crackdown on dec 13 1981 to crush solidarity 
solidarity was legalized again this april after a sevenyear ban 
and its representatives trounced communists in june parliamentary 
elections

south dakota would grow by 1800 acres under a 
bill rushed through a house committee thursday to move back a 
12mile stretch of the nebraska border that lies along the shifting 
course of the missouri river 
the strip of land on the north side of the river just west of 
sioux city iowa technically lies in nebraska because the rivers 
course has moved since the boundary was set in 1905 rep tim 
johnson dsd told the house judiciary subcommittee on 
administrative law 
an interstate compact that must be approved by congress would 
fix the boundary along the rivers main channel legislatures of 
both states have approved the change 
the house could vote on the bill as early as monday johnson 
said 
johnson said the river is relatively stable now because the 
corps of engineers has brought the river under control with dams 
and channels 
however the corps of engineers said in a letter to the 
committee that it is technically correct that the river is 
stable now but that the channel could shift at some time as dikes 
erode 
johnson said congress should act quickly on the compact so that 
construction can begin on a planned community and business park 
along the river in union county sd 
the dakota dunes development which would occupy 400 acres of 
the disputed area is eventually expected to house 3000 people he 
said

west berlins newest shelter for homeless 
east german refugees will have 400 small rooms walls three feet 
thick and all the comfort of a jail which is what it was 
us army engineer units armed with steelcutting rescue saws 
and acetylene torches stormed the former youth detention center 
wednesday morning and began cutting out the inchthick bars on the 
windows and removing the reinforced cell doors the army has 
offered to help with the refugees 
the engineers have just three days to make the house of 
detention into a home the 19thcentury prison building still in 
use as a jail until five years ago will be used as a transit 
center for the refugees most of whom are now sleeping in schools 
and other public buildings 
since the berlin wall and the other fortifications dividing east 
from west germany were opened friday millions of east germans have 
flooded into the west although most have gone back across to their 
homes the west berlin government said that about 7500 east german 
refugees had come to stay 
my job is to get all the bars out of the window to get away 
from the jail cell appearance said sgt robert j hart as the 
gasolinepowered disc saws of his men roared and spewed exhaust 
fumes along the cell blocks 
his unit is also tearing out the iron bed frames and the 
antiquated cell toilets to make the 7by12 foot cells more 
liveable the jailhouse graffiti will have to stay because theres 
no time for painting 
theyre going to move in more suitable furniture hart said 
its better than sleeping on the streets at least theyre out of 
the weather 
its kind of ironic that now theyre trying to get out to 
freedom theyre moving into a jail i just hope they appreciate 
it 
known to local wags as the cafe schoenstedstrasse because of 
its location at the intersection of karl marx strasse and 
schoenstedstrasse in the borough of neukoln the four tiers of 
cells surround an exercise courtyard where occupants will be able 
to stretch their legs 
the west berlin government will provide food for the refugees 
until more permanent lodging can be found 
because of their size each cell can only accomodate one person 
but hart said theyd be as comfortable as the army can make them 
i believe everybody should have a chance for freedom now 
theyre having it said hart from california mo 
but one of his men spec 4 daniel bross of newton ill was 
concerned that a prison might be too much a reminder of repression 
how would you feel if just got out of a country where you 
couldnt do nothing and they stuck you in a 6by6 room

eight months after a cyanide scare briefly 
halted the import of chilean fruit some researchers believe that 
the poison found in grapes was introduced after they arrived in the 
united states a newspaper reported thursday 
the wall street journal quoted researchers as saying that if the 
grapes had been injected prior to their twoweek voyage from chile 
they would have shriveled before they arrived 
it would have been difficult to get to the grapes when they were 
in the hold of the ship the newspaper said and food and drug 
administration officials say that the ship was unloaded amid tight 
security 
the newspaper said researchers at the university of california 
at davis found that four hours after they injected cyanide into 
grapes cyanide levels matched the amounts found by fda chemists 
that suggests the grapes were injected after they were unloaded 
and in fda hands but before they were tested the newspaper said 
an fda spokesman strongly rejected the journal account 
its the fdas continued belief that the grapes were poisoned 
in chile before the ship left spokesman jeff nesbit said 
the journal also quoted researchers who were critical of the 
tests performed by fda chemists after inspectors in philadelphia 
turned up three grapes they believed were tainted 
they said by using a centrifuge instead of a distilling process 
the fda chemists exaggerated the amount of cyanide in the grapes 
the journal also reported that despite claims by the fda that 
inspectors were on a hitormiss mission when they found the 
tainted grapes it appears that they specifically zeroed in on the 
ship on which the grapes came and on the grapes of a single 
vineyard 
fdas nesbit said that a terrorist had made threats that his 
group could poison the grapes up to and when the ship was actually 
sailing but because it would be difficult to poison the grapes in 
the hold of the ship because of the way crates are packed it seems 
most likely the grapes were poisoned before the ship sailed as the 
agency has maintained all along 
asked about the storys inference that cyanidelaced grapes 
would deteriorate after two weeks he said we have done our own 
experiments where grapes injected with cyanide after two weeks had 
not deteriorated much that they still looked appetizing 
he added that probably some cyanidelaced grapes might 
deteriorate after two weeks but not all of them 
asked if the fda was involved in the poisoning he said no 
thats not very feasible or possible 
he denied the fda had been tipped to where to look for the 
grapes we had no idea where to look for those grapes he said

millions of dollars have been wasted because 
of mismanagement in federal programs that subsidize agriculture 
exports a farm state congressman said thursday 
this is one of the biggest cases of mismanagment ever in the 
history of the agriculture department said rep dan glickman 
dkan after receiving two investigative reports on three export 
programs 
glickman said the investigations by the agriculture departments 
inspector general and the congressional general accounting office 
did not reveal fraud but showed lack of controls 
there has been an enormous waste of government funds he 
said of the export enhancement program the targeted export 
assistance program and the export credit guarantee programs 
these audits were done prior to this administration said 
sally michael spokeswoman for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter 
she said the department appreciates the review of the programs 
and is working with both the inspector general and gao 
we want to respond to their criticisms she said 
the first two programs were established in 1985 to help us 
exporters compete with countries that heavily subsidize their 
commodities on the world market the third guarantees that 
exporters will be repaid for credit sales made to foreign buyers 
even if the buyer defaults 
when it comes to targeted export assistance and export 
enhancment foreign agriculture service officials have not been 
sufficiently documenting their decisions and say they dont have 
time to do so said the gao 
we believe that such documentation is essential to ensure 
accountablity and fairness the agency said 
furthermore the inspector general said the foreign agriculture 
service didnt have written policies to determine how it calculates 
the subsidies it gives 
although fas officials prepare price sheets which list each of 
the figures used in price and bonus calculations they do not 
provide either narrative or statistical support to explain how they 
arrived at these figures said the gao 
the reviews indicated control weaknesses in the bonus payment 
process which allowed overpayments to occur said the gao 
the gao also said better controls were needed in the credit 
guarantee program 
our review also indicates that controls are not in place to 
ensure that exporters are complying with applicable regulations 
said the gao 
glickman said the inspector generals report estimates that 
usda may have misspent as much as 1148 million solely in 
miscalculating bonuses awarded to exporters by understanding the 
world price and overstating incidental costs incurred by 
participating exporters

the united states said thursday it will ask 
for an investigation into the killing of six roman catholic priests 
in el salvador and will accelerate deliveries of military aid to 
government forces there 
we do not know who committed this barbarous act which we 
condemn in the strongest possible terms said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
a jesuit priest who spoke only on condition he not be 
identified told reporters in san salvador that a witness saw 30 
uniformed soldiers enter the grounds of the university of central 
america shortly before the six priests and two university employees 
were tortured and killed 
both the salvadoran government and its armed forces denied any 
involvement in the incident 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater condemned the 
killings in a statement late thursday and said the salvadoran 
government was reported to have begun an investigation 
we condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrageous 
murder of father ignacio ellacuria rector of the university of 
central america and the other jesuit priests in el salvador 
fitzwater said 
we understand that the salvadoran government has begun an 
investigation and we will be watching this investigation closely 
ms tutwiler said us ambassador william walker will ask the 
salvadoran government for a full inquiry into killings at the 
university she said walker intended to raise the matter directly 
with salvadoran president alfredo cristiani on thursday 
the conference of major superiors of men representing 260 
religious orders condemned the killings and called for renewed 
efforts to negotiate a peace in el salvador 
sen barbara mikulski dmd said she and rep joe moakley 
dmass had sent telegrams to the salvadoran government and 
leftist fmln guerrillas asking them to respect a red cross request 
for a 72hour ceasefire to allow evacuation of civilians and the 
wounded 
she said the bush administration should do everything it can to 
halt the fighting and arrange negotiations 
pete williams spokesman for defense secretary dick cheney said 
the pentagon is accelerating delivery of military assistance 
previously requested by salvadoran authorities 
ms tutwiler said the request from san salvador included riot 
control equipment and light weaponry 
i understand some of the equipment is new but other items have 
been on request for some time and we are merely speeding up 
delivery williams said 
the administration has requested 370 million in economic and 
military aid next year for el salvador which the united states 
regards as its closest ally in central america of the total 85 
million is arms aid 
ms tutwiler said the united states is confident of the 
cristiani governments ability to defeat the guerrillas who began a 
major offensive earlier this week 
we believe the salvadoran govenment is able to manage the 
situation she said 
the pentagon spokesman said us military advisers are 
monitoring the situation but are neither involved in the fighting 
nor directing salvadoran troops 
us officials have accused the rebels of using civilians in san 
salvador as protection and say salvadoran troops are moving 
cautious to keep down the number of casualties 
both the army and the ai force are dislodging remaining 
pockets of guerrillas from neighborhoods where they have dug in 
ms tutwiler said in this environment where the fmln is using 
civilians to shield its combatants strict rules of engagement have 
been issued by the salvadoran government to prevent civilian 
casualties she said

presidents bushs nominee to head the urban 
mass transportation administration was approved by the senate after 
a twomonth delay while a committee investigated work done by his 
auditing firm 
brian w clymer was confirmed by unanimous consent wednesday 
night once a hold on his nomination was lifted by the senate 
banking housing and urban affairs committee 
the committee had unanimously backed clymers nomination on 
sept 8 but the panel delayed sending the nomination to the senate 
floor while it examined work done by clymers suburban philadelphia 
accounting firm on behalf of an economic development organization 
nearby according to a senate aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
according to the aide the committee asked a certified public 
accountant from the general accounting office of congress to 
determine whether clymers firm should have uncovered questionable 
expenditures by the delaware county economic development 
partnership the aide said it was determined the firm had done its 
job properly 
a committee spokeswoman said thursday she could not discuss the 
results of the investigation all senate confirmation procedures 
had been completed and it was now time to release the hold 
committee aide deborah deyoung said 
the partnership was founded in 1983 by rep curt weldon rpa 
the congressman asked consultant anthony j dunleavy to investigate 
the partnership earlier this year following press reports about the 
awarding of nobid contracts 
of particular interest to the senate panel were nobid contracts 
awarded clymers firm by the partnership to audit its books 
dunleavy said in an interview thursday that he was asked about the 
contracts recently by the committee staff 
dunleavy said that this years contract was properly bid but he 
said that the contracts for 1986 1987 and 1988 were not awarded 
through competitive procurement policies required by the federal 
government and that federal money was used 
dunleavy also said thursday that the partnership misspent 
121000 in federal funds on ineligible items such as a promotional 
film between july 1988 and july 1989 
but dunleavy said that clymers firm was just now auditing that 
period dunleavy said there had also been improper expenditures in 
previous years but that there was no reason clymers firm should 
have discovered them 
in laymans terms hes been criticized for not doing 
something he was never asked to do dunleavy said he also said 
clymer should not have been expected to know that the 1986 1987 
and 1988 contracts were not properly bid 
clymer already has a desk at umta where he has been acting as a 
consultant umta assists state and local governments in improving 
mass transportation systems 
clymer was on a business trip in california thursday and could 
not be reached for comment according to umta spokesman richard 
centner clymer is the former vice chairman of the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority which runs philadelphias 
mass transit system

a navy boat with 10 sailors aboard was 
swamped as it returned to base thursday to take part in an 
unprecedented twoday standdown that had sailors around the 
world brushing up on safety 
in navy wardrooms and engine compartments flight decks and 
hangars crews were busy in lectures and training the navy ordered 
the halt to normal operations tuesday after a rash of 10 accidents 
over the last three weeks killed 10 people and injured at least 71 
the 36foot navy seafox was swamped in stormy weather on the 
nearby york river as it headed to cheatham annex near williamsburg 
the 10 sailors aboard the seafox were picked up by a virginia 
institute of marine science vessel that was in the area said lt 
cmdr steve burnett an atlantic fleet spokesman in norfolk none 
were injured 
a seafox is a twinengine boat designed for special warfare 
operations 
a second seafox towed the swamped boat which is designed to 
float even when flooded said burnett they were returning from 
training in maryland 
at no time was it a life threatening situation he said 
meanwhile aboard the guided missile cruiser uss josephus 
daniels docked at the norfolk naval station petty officer mike 
ballard instructed seamen in damage control 
again and again ballard walked sailors through the proper way 
to wear firefighting equipment and the necessary checks for each 
safety device 
every sailor is trained in damage control according to lt jg 
paul ward the ships assistant damage control officer he said the 
ships runs a daily fire or rescue drill ward saw the standdown as 
a good way to stress safety to all hands 
our job is to carry out our mission while sustaining damage 
everyone here has to be a capable firefighter when there is a fire 
on board you cant just run away there is nowhere to run 
ward said 
throughout the ship sailors gathered in compartments for talks 
about electrical safety fire aid and weapons handling 
while sailors were going to school aboard the daniels 30 miles 
away at the oceana naval air station the pilots of squardon vf41 
were in their ready room going over data on the flight performance 
of the f14 tomcat 
the squadron already had been scheduled for a safety inspection 
friday by the naval safety center so the standdown did not affect 
the flight schedule one pilot characterized the exercise as a 
twoday standaround 
but aboard the san diegobased carrier independence were 
taking this very seriously said ship spokesman lt greg smith 
a standdown doesnt mean everything is at a standstill 
said lt mike andrews a spokesman for the us 7th fleet based in 
japan ships at sea will obviously maintain normal watch 
stations while conducting safety reviews 
at the miramar naval air station in san diego rear adm phil 
anselmo joined about 1000 sailors in a walk around runways 
taxiways and aprons looking for potentially hazardous litter they 
found about 50 pounds including industrial bolts and chunks of 
epoxy 
out on the hangar floor at oceana lt cmdr ken heimgartner 
watched young crewmen go over his f14 
after a while you start equating safety with combat 
readiness said heimgartner the squadron commander when you 
start seeing something unsafe thats an indicator you may not be 
combat ready 
the order tuesday gave all navy units 72 hours to complete 48 
hours of safety standdown most atlantic fleet units began the 
standdown thursday morning according to burnett 
standdowns are not unusual though this is the first in memory 
that involved the entire service said capt ferguson norton the 
navys top safety officer

the heart of an israeli soldier ambushed and 
killed by arab guerrillas was sewn into the chest of a palestinian 
on thursday a gift of life that family members said transcends the 
bitter war between arab and jew 
hanna khader 54 a former hotel manager from israeliannexed 
east jerusalem was recovering in stable condition in the intensive 
care ward at hadassah medical center khaders family said 
god i dont really know what to say said his daughter 
jamilla we thank the family that agreed to give the heart to a 
human being without looking if he were an arab or a jew 
khaders wife mary said i cant tell you how happy i am 
hes a human being and there is no difference between a palestinian 
and an israeli in such cases 
jamilla told israel radio the family learned from the media that 
her fathers heart donor was a slain israeli soldier 
she indicated her family had some concern that they could be 
targeted by palestinian or islamic radicals for accepting an 
israelis heart but said in such cases we cannot mix politics 
with medicine 
i hope that the events in the occupied territories will end 
and everything will return to normal she added 
the heart was removed from sgt zeev traum 40 after he died 
wednesday night of a head wound suffered after palestinian 
guerrillas raked his patrol jeep with at least 28 rounds of 
automatic gunfire in an ambush monday israel radio said a second 
soldier also was killed 
traum an army reservist and father of four was the 42nd 
israeli to die in the violence of the 23month uprising against 
israeli rule at least 615 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
troops or civilians in the bloodshed another 146 palestinians have 
been slain by others who accused them of collaborating with israeli 
authorities 
in an interview with israel television that broke a day of 
silence brenda traum refused comment when asked whether she agreed 
to the doctors request to transplant her husbands heart into the 
body of an arab 
she did say however that she believed her husband would have 
agreed to donate an organ if it could save a life 
if it is possible to save a person i think it is a religious 
commandment she said speaking from her home in yodfat a 
collective farm where traum raised flowers for export 
zeev was a man who helped people as a natural matter of 
course without being asked she said we spoke about 
transplants a bit and he said it was a good thing 
hadassah hospital took the unusual step of asking doctors and 
spokesmen not to comment on the transplant israel radio said 
apparently because of the operations sensitive political nature 
azai applebaum the director of cardiology broke the silence 
thursday night and appeared on television 
we treat the sick and we have never looked at nationality or 
identity he said i dont think that this point has 
significance in an operation like this 
israel radio said traums condition began deteriorating rapidly 
tuesday night and doctors asked the family to agree to donate his 
heart to one of dozens of israelis and arabs waiting for a 
transplant 
the family agreed and khader was chosen as a recipient because 
his body tissue closely matched that of traum 
the heart was flown in a special ice chest by military 
helicopter from soroka hospital in beer sheva to jerusalems 
hadassah hospital at midnight wednesday night and the 4hour 
transplant was immediately performed 
it was the ninth heart transplant performed in israel but the 
first known case since the uprising began of an israeli donating an 
organ to a palestinian 
in december the family of a palestinian family shot to death by 
an israeli soldier in the west bank town of nablus refused to 
donate their sons heart to an israeli civilian 
the palestinian nasr hawwash 20 was declared brain dead after 
sustaining a serious head wound dec 16 during a demonstration 
the israeli yehiel israeli 46 had been hooked to a respirator 
since dec 18 after unsuccessful surgery on a heart valve he died 
three days later

affected but businesses banks and offices were open and public 
transport operated normally 
labor minister oscar zamora claimed only 2 percent of the work 
force took part in the strike 
officials declared the strike illegal and said police would 
arrest labor leaders who disobeyed the state of siege which 
imposes a curfew from 1 am to 5 am restricts public gatherings 
and allows arrests without warrant 
guillermo capobianco the interior minister said the purpose of 
the state of siege was to preserve economic stability and the 
foreign assistance needed to reactivate the economy reestablish 
peace and guarantee municipal elections 
the bolivian workers central which includes most of bolivias 
labor force called the strike to demand freedom for 858 teachers 
students and workers police detained wednesday the government 
released several hundred but sent 146 to detention camps in the 
bolivian tropics 
president jaime paz zamoras government declared the state of 
siege wednesday in response to protest marches and a hunger strike 
by hundreds of teachers and other workers police have used tear 
gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of rock throwing students 
and teachers

union were in critical condition from the effects of a 24day 
hunger strike but doctors said thursday they were out of danger 
teachers demand the equivalent of 103 each in a yearend bonus

political activity on the streets said antonio aranibar of the 
united leftist party 
holding elections under a state of siege constitutes a 
tremendous aberration without precedent in latin america said a 
statement from the nationalist revolutionary movement the main 
opposition party 
the opposition group which controlled the government during the 
four years before paz zamora took office three months ago declared 
states of siege on two occasions to quell social unrest and 
opposition to its austerity measures

increases or bonuses until next year

the communist party overhauled its ruling 
politburo on thursday sweeping out three members of the old guard 
and installing four more liberal men likely to support petar 
mladenov the new leader 
the oneday session of the partys policysetting central 
committee was called less than a week after the removal of todor 
zhivkov 78 who led the nation with rigid orthodoxy for 35 years 
bta the official news agency said speakers at the central 
committee meeting described the remaking of the politburo as a step 
without which onward progress is hardly possible 
they expressed the partys resolve to pursue the watershed 
policy of renewal of socialism on the basis of democratization 
openness and responsibility of everyone the agency said 
zhivkov resigned nov 10 and was replaced by mladenov 53 who 
was foreign minister and is considered more open to reform 
the central committee ousted three members of the 10member 
politburo with close ties to zhivkov and named four new members 
one of the seats filled was zhivkovs 
the committee also accepted a proposal that mladenov be 
nominated to replace zhivkov as president and approved suggestions 
for unspecified government changes proposed by premier georgi 
atanassov bta reported 
mladenov is expected to be replaced as foreign minister but the 
agency gave no indication of what other changes might be made 
removed from office was politburo member milko balev 69 a 
close associate of zhivkov who for many years was his private 
secretary also ousted was dimitar stoyanov 61 a former interior 
minister 
western analysts speaking on condition of anonymity said 
stoyanov was associated with the widely condemned forced 
assimiliation of the 15 millionmember turkish minority 
also removed was grisha filipov 70 a former premier who was 
responsible for economic policy 
balev stoyanov and filipov were also expelled from the central 
committee

mihailov and svetlin roussev who were removed in 1988 
roussev an artist was active in establishing an unofficial 
committee to protect the environment while mihailov had been 
stripped of his ideology portfolio after being criticized for what 
appeared to be deemed a too liberal interpretation of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
mladenov has moved quickly to assert reforms since his 
appointment nov 10 when he pledged greater openness and called 
for the establishment of a contemporary democratic and 
lawabiding country 
his appointment was greeted by intellectuals and the official 
media according to an opinion poll published in the trade union 
daily troud on thursday bulgarian citizens also welcomed the new 
leader as providing hope for change 
thursdays personnel changes followed a decision by the 
politburo on monday to restore the party membership of 11 activists 
and on tuesday mladenov met with a group of intellectuals many of 
them members of opposition groups 
the leadership shakeup in bulgaria comes as reform is sweeping 
the soviet bloc this balkan country has traditionally been one of 
the kremlins most loyal allies but while zhivkovs leadership 
paid lipservice to reform little was done to implement change

a former police captain has 
admitted participating in the murders of government opponents as 
part of a special police unit a newspaper reported friday 
dirk coetzee identified in the article as a white captain who 
left the police force in 1982 was interviewed on the indian ocean 
island of mauritius after leaving south africa last week said the 
afrikaanslanguage newspaper free weekly 
the paper quoted coetzee as saying he had been actively involved 
with a police hit squad until august 1982 when he left the force 
but had kept in contact with the units members and knew of further 
misdeeds committed since his departure 
coetzee is the second former policeman recently to admit being 
part of a death squad last month a black former security 
policeman on death row was reprieved the day before his set 
execution when he contacted attorneys and said that when he was 
part of the squad in 1981 he had killed black antiapartheid 
attorney griffiths mxenge in durban 
the black policeman was about to hang for a murder committed 
during a robbery after he left the police force and he said he 
spoke out because his former colleagues failed to keep promises to 
save him 
according to free weekly coetzee also listed the mxenge murder 
among the acts committed by the squad to which he belonged the 
paper said coetzee admitted planning and taking part in murders 
the newspaper quoted coetzee as saying the police death squad 
sent the letter bomb to maputo mozambique in 1982 that killed 
ruth first wife of south african communist party leader joe slovo 
the paper said coetzee also said his squad was responsible for 
the killing of african national congress member patrick makau 
and his child at manzini swaziland in 1980 
a bomb explosion at the ancs london office in 1982 
the murder of two anc members near komatipoort on the 
mozambican border in 1980 
the attempted murder of anc military wing leader chris hani in 
lesotho 
in the article coetzee alleged that police stole cars killed 
guard dogs and people with poison and used former members of 
outlawed guerrilla organizations to carry out some deeds 
the free weekly article was made available just after midnight 
to the independent south african press association and there was 
no immediate comment from police officials but highranking 
officials already have been appointed to investigate the charges 
made by the reprieved black security policeman 
there have been about 20 unsolved killings and bombings of 
antiapartheid activists and organizations the past 10 years 
antiapartheid leaders have often said they believe security force 
members are involved but have no proof 
the free weekly said coetzee had left the country with his wife 
and children to start a new life and gave the interview to put 
the past right

federal sentencing guidelines violate the 
rights of criminal defendants by giving prosecutors arbitrary power 
to determine prison terms a federal judge ruled thursday 
us district judge harold h greene said the guidelines are 
revolutionizing the criminal justice system by letting 
prosecutors determine punishment 
this change has in substantial measure eliminated the safety 
valve in terms of fairness and due process of an impartial judge 
exercising whatever sentencing discretion any particular criminal 
statute allows greene said 
the full impact of greenes ruling is not clear but it could 
set the stage for a new nationwide test of the sentencing law 
us attorney jay stephens who is in charge of prosecutions in 
federal court here said in a statement issued by his office that 
he was reviewing the opinion and could not comment immediately on 
its impact 
in the past five years in response to the escalating drug 
epidemic and related crimes of violence congress has enacted 
fundamental and important changes in the criminal justice system 
stephens said the us attorneys office will utilize fairly and 
aggressvely all the laws enacted by congress in fulfilling our 
obligation to protect the citizens of this community 
the supreme court in an 81 ruling in january said the 
sentencing guidelines do not violate constitutionally required 
separation of powers between the three branches of government 
but the justices did not decide whether the new system violates 
due process protections for defendants the grounds relied upon by 
greene 
the system took effect in november 1987 for people convicted of 
federal crimes and was designed to eliminate what some called 
unjustified disparities in sentences those accused of crimes in 
state courts are not affected 
greene became at least the second federal judge to declare the 
new system violates due process rights aimed at guaranteeing fair 
play for all defendants 
us district judge michael m mihm in peoria ill handed down 
a similar ruling in september 
greene said the system may be particularly capricious because of 
the secrecy surrounding what crime a defendant will be accused of 
commiting that decision takes place in the back rooms of the 
us attorneys office not in open court the judge said 
it often means a young prosecutor with little experience will 
decide whether the defendant is accused of a crime carrying a 
fiveyear or a 20year prison term he said 
greene acted in the case of five people accused of drugrelated 
crimes 
one defendant identified only as jane doe has a 4yearold 
child and is seven months pregnant greene said 
she faces a prison term of 21 to 27 months for transporting 
marijuana the judge said moreover he continued she is 
handicapped from plea bargaining for leniency because she 
apparently is not in a position to give prosecutors enough help in 
convicting any drug kingpin 
greene ordered a hearing for the woman to determine whether 
prosecutors were aribitrary and capricious in refusing to give 
her the chance for a reduced sentence 
he also ordered hearings for stephaney roberts who faces a 
mandatory 10year sentence for distributing crack cocaine and 
vernon holland charged with cocaine possession with intent to 
distribute 
greene dismissed similar charges against albert mills and 
kenneth wonson

the main communist party daily until now the 
most reluctant to embrace the new spirit of change jumped on the 
reform bandwagon thursday with a new editor and a more lively tone 
in a frontpage notice to readers neues deutschland said the 
moves were needed to promote renewal previously the newspaper had 
been critical of opposition groups and of calls for an end to the 
communist monopoly on power 
longtime chief editor herbert naumann was replaced by wolfgang 
spickermann who signed the announcement of the toplevel shakeup 
as in all of the fundamental organizations within our party 
the comrades in editing and publishing in these weeks have exposed 
their work to a confrontation with the past the newspaper said 
the result of these discussions is not just a new editorial 
board but above all the concept for a rejuvenated newspaper 
neues deutschland said 
it promised new content more information political views and 
timely journalistic forums 
while staterun east german television and other publications 
have given relatively balanced coverage of the rise of opposition 
groups and independent actions by parties allied with the 
communists neues deutschland had been more defensive of the 
partys leading role and control of state affairs 
the newspapers front page on thursday conveyed a more 
reformoriented image with more than a dozen articles addressing 
problems and benefits resulting from the newly opened borders and 
other changes introduced the past month 
it also published a call for more public involvement in 
government affairs providing telephone numbers for readers to call 
in with advice proposals and criticism 
the format of the newspaper was little revised with numerous 
small articles but no pictures to break up the gray monotony 
but the changed approach to reporting was clear in articles from 
foreign countries discussing what can or should be done to help 
east germany develop in the right political and economic directions

citizens still must have police 
approval to travel to the west after the first of the year even 
though exit visas will not be necessary the government said 
thursday 
premier ladislav adamec announced tuesday that exit visas no 
longer would be required 
government spokesman miroslav pavel told reporters thursday the 
visa would be replaced by a statistical sheet issued by police 
and valid for one trip abroad 
interior ministry spokesman jiri belohlavek told the official 
news agency ctk the statistical sheets were being introduced 
because a record of czechoslovak citizens travels abroad is 
necessary he did not elaborate 
anyone wishing to travel to the west now must apply for exit 
visas with interior ministry authorities after receiving a 
passport stamps of approval are required from the local communist 
party branch the persons employer and the army so the process 
can take up to 30 days 
even under the new regulations czechoslovaks would have to 
maintain foreign currency deposits in banks or present invitations 
to visit from relatives or friends abroad pavel said 
government officials have given no indication that people 
previously denied passports will be given permission to travel 
under the new regulations 
the government said thursday it would cancel weekend trips to 
czechoslovakia organized by state travel agencies for people from 
poland hungary the soviet union and yugoslavia due to 
excessive purchases of consumer goods 
rising prices in those countries and shortages of certain goods 
make food clothing and shoes relatively cheap in czechoslovakia 
last month authorities restricted exports of a long list of 
consumer goods ranging from meat to personal computers

a veteran police officer killed two 
13yearold boys with a single shotgun blast to their backs after 
one of the youths pointed a screwdriver at him and he mistook it 
for a gun authorities said thursday 
thia yang and basee lor who were suspected of auto theft were 
shot wednesday with a 12gauge shotgun fired by inver grove heights 
officer kenneth murphy according to mark shields superintendent 
of the state bureau of criminal apprehension 
officer murphy fearing his life was in danger discharged his 
weapon shields said at a news conference 
however the killings angered members of minnesotas southeast 
asian community who said murphy had used unneccessary force the 
boys parents who live in st paul are hmong immigrants 
murphy was placed on paid administrative leave pending a grand 
jury investigation which is expected to open in about three weeks 
said dakota county attorney james backstrom a special prosecutor 
from the state attorney generals office will present the evidence 
he said 
the decision on whether that was justifiable use of deadly 
force is up to the grand jury backstrom said 
authorities at the press conference declined to answer questions 
about why the boys were shot in the back 
yang vang director of the lao family community of minnesota 
charged that the police officer had acted recklessly vang said his 
center had been receiving telephone calls from outraged laotian 
neighbors 
members are very very upset vang said 
ge yang coordinator of the laotian centers delinquency 
prevention program complained that murphy should have known how 
to deal with those kids without firing a gun 
the brief chase involving police from inver grove heights 
rosemount and dakota county began at 1231 pm wednesday when a 
rosemount police squad responded to a report of an auto theft 
according to shields 
the pursuit continued after the car went into a ditch in inver 
grove heights and three boys fled on foot he said 
murphy a 20year veteran pursued the boys on foot through a 
field he took cover behind a hay wagon identified himself as a 
police officer and shouted at the boys who fled into fivefoot 
high raspberry bushes shields said the officer saw yang raise his 
hand with what murphy thought was a gun he said 
murphy was about 30 yards away from yang when he shot and lor 
was about 15 feet behind and to the side of yang shields said 
we dont think the officer even realized that lor was in 
such close vicinity he added 
yang was shot in the back and upper left shoulder by one of the 
nine pellets in the shell severing his aorta according to the 
ramsey county coroner 
lor was hit by three pellets one in the arm one in the spinal 
column and another in the stomach causing severe abdominal 
bleeding 
the third boy a 14yearold was arrested after the shooting 
authorities said 
le yang thia yangs 14yearold sister said her brother was an 
eighthgrader at washington junior high school in st paul 
it was their fault the polices fault she told the st 
paul pioneer press dispatch they dont have the right to take 
out their gun and shoot him to me my brother is a nice guy he 
doesnt fool around he doesnt do bad things 
inver grove heights mayor william saed described murphy as a 
very stable officer over the years 
its very unfortunate for the boys a real tragedy saed 
said but its a tragedy for the officer too something must 
have happened to cause him to do that

house members voted thursday to raise their 
pay by more than 30000 a year over the next 13 months to above 
120000 a year while revising ethics rules to put new limits on 
outside earnings 
the bill was passed 252 to 174 just 10 months after intense 
public criticism forced the house to reject a larger pay increase 
the new proposal sped through the house with strong support from 
the leaders of both parties and an endorsement from president bush 
a slight majority of republicans voting opposed the bill despite 
bushs stance 
the senate planned to consider the plan friday including 
whether to take the same salary increases the house approved for 
itsef government executives and federal judges with congress 
hoping to adjourn next week senate leaders scheduled an unusual 
bipartisan caucus for friday morning to iron things out 
i can understand and sympathize with people in my district who 
make 15 and 20 and 30000 a year who would have trouble 
understanding why this kind of pay level is needed said house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
but he told his colleagues in your heart and in your 
mind you know its the right thing to do 
rep james a traficant dohio took a different view 
i understand the game we come with ethics reform and we 
sneak in a pay raise he said 
the complex 100page pay and ethics package was announced by 
democratic and republican leaders wednesday but copies were not 
made available to the public until debate was well under way 
thursday 
public criticism some of it galvanized by broadcast talkshow 
hosts helped lead to defeat of a proposed 51 percent congressional 
pay raise earlier this year but there was no time this time 
without public hearings without a decent interval of time for 
the american people to digest it the house leadership 
railroaded it through complained consumer advocate ralph nader 
who opposes congressional pay increases 
but ann mcbride senior vice president of common cause the 
selfproclaimed public interest organization hailed the action as 
moving toward a time when we will have government fully 
compensated by the public and not by special interest influence 
money 
the bill would increase salaries in the house for federal 
judges and for top executive branch officials by at least 35 
percent and often by closer to 40 percent 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the senate 
would consider the bill friday however it was not clear what 
raises or honoraria limits the senate might include for itself 
the senate could give itself a smaller raise as it did earlier 
this decade senators were paid less than house members for about 
six months seven years ago before senators approved a catchup 
raise 
the house bill provides for a 79 percent costofliving hike by 
january on jan 1 1991 a 25 percent raise would be given on 
top of whatever costofliving increase is given to rankandfile 
civil servants at that time 
assuming a 3 percent 1991 civil service raise house members who 
now make 89500 likely would see their pay increase to about 
125000 
however lawmakers who currently add to their incomes with 
honoraria for speeches would have to give that up current rules 
allow house members to pocket honoraria totaling up to 30 percent 
of their salaries while senators can keep 40 percent 
gephardt cited the honoraria rules as a key reform which would 
raise public confidence in congress he implored house members to 
have courage to vote for the package 
we heard a hero yesterday talk to us about courage he said 
recalling wednesdays congressional address by polish labor leader 
lech walesa today is the day for us to be leaders to have 
courage to do whats right for this body this institution and for 
this country and its people 
bush who has been seeking for months to increase salaries for 
his top aides and for federal judges cleared the way for house 
action this week by giving his blessing to the package he made it 
more difficult for democrats or republicans to use pay as a 
partisan issue 
rep vic fazio dcalif cochairman of the task force that 
drafted the package announced thursday that the heads of the two 
political parties were signing a statement that they have no 
intention of having it become part of the 1990 election dialogue 
the ethics reforms in the bill stem in part from the case of 
former speaker jim wright dtexas who resigned from the house in 
june after the house ethics committee charged him with evading 
limits on honoraria income and with accepting improper gifts 
foley vowed when he took over the speakership that he would push 
an ethics bill to the floor this year and said it probably would 
have to include a pay raise to get members support 
the legislation would bar house members from accepting fees for 
speeches but they could suggest their hosts pass on up to 2000 
in the members name to a charity of the members choice the bill 
requires members to reveal the donor but not the destination of the 
money 
income earned outside the house would be limited to 15 percent 
of salary beginning in 1991 members could not receive directors 
fees legal fees or other income for professional services book 
royalties would remain exempt from the limits but with new 
restrictions 
the bill also would tighten rules on accepting gifts and on 
travel that members may accept 
it says boys and girls this is a fulltime job pay attention 
to whats going on here well compensate you straight from the 
public treasury right out in the open but no more side employment 
deals said rep david obey dwis

known for his scenes of philadelphia and north carolina has died 
he was 93 
speight died at his greenville home on tuesday 
he was a painter with gentlemanly manners who captured the 
clouddappled skies of philadelphia and the looming pines of 
eastern north carolina with lyrical grace and informality his 
style blended a concern for fleeting effects of light and 
atmosphere along with a bedrock sense of place 
collectors dealers and museum officials said his reputation 
extended beyond the state and interest was in rising in his work 
and life as well as prices of his paintings 
his paintings are in the collections of the metropolitan museum 
of art in new york the boston museum of fine arts and the 
philadelphia museum of art

throughout the united states said richard s schneiderman 
director of the north carolina museum of art 
in philadelphia speight is considered one of the most 
important painters of the philadelphia scene said carl 
jorgensen the washington dealer whose gallery represents the 
artist an exhibition of the artists work opens at the gallery at 
the end of the month

a boy he disliked farm chores but showed an aptitude for writing 
and drawing in 1915 speight enrolled at wake forest college and 
began taking art lessons at meredith college 
in 1920 speight enrolled at the corcoran school of art in 
washington and later went on to the pennsylvania academy of fine

the ruling military will dictate the 
platforms and register members of the two parties it will permit to 
contest elections returning africas most populous nation to 
democracy it announced thursday 
the moves were the latest by the military to take more control 
over the transition to civilian rule last month maj gen ibrahim 
babangida the head of state rejected each of the 13 parties the 
civilian national election board had nominated to compete in local 
and parliamentary elections 
babangida who seized power from civilian president shehu 
shagari in 1983 and banned political parties until may says the 
military needs to be involved in even the smallest details of the 
transition to civilian rule to avoid tribalism and corruption the 
changeover is set to be completed by oct 1 1992 
the announcement means the government rejects the platforms 
proposed by the civilian election board which the military had 
originally entrusted with registering parties and defining their 
platforms earlier this week the board gave babangida platforms 
for a leftcenter and a rightcenter party 
the policymaking armed forces ruling council said late thursday 
that the party platforms would be written by a council committee 
and published within two months registration of party members 
would begin immediately after the platforms were published 
in rejecting the 13 parties on oct 7 babangida said none had 
passed the test as imposed by our vision of a new political order 
he said the parties which had each raised at least 3 million 
and gathered petitions of support from the 435 local government 
districts had close ties to past parties that had failed nigeria 
babangida had said the civilian election board would monitor the 
election process and polling 
babangida said limiting the country to two political parties was 
the only way to avoid regional ethnic or religious divisions his 
government blames factionalism for the failure of previous civilian 
governments 
the general already had banned all former politicians from 
taking part and had extended the ban to officials now in the 
government or military 
nigeria an oilproducing nation with a population of 95 
million has seen its economy near collapse from mismanagement 
corruption and falling oil prices it has been ruled by the 
military for 20 of the 29 years it has been independent from 
britain

police clashed with striking 
black workers thursday and the governmentrun transport company 
fired hundreds more employees demanding nearly 2 times their 
current pay 
police said six officers were hurt in two clashes 
the south african transport services said it fired 800 strikers 
after dropping 626 from the payroll earlier this week the company 
said the walkout is illegal because rail trucking and harbor 
operations are designated as essential 
police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway station 
in germiston near johannesburg when about 50 strikers arrived by 
train for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares 
officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked with 
sticks whips and stones police said strikers scattered after 
officers fired two pistol shots according to police who said 
three officers were injured 
an hour later three more officers were hurt trying to disperse 
about 150 strikers outside a union office in germiston according 
to police headquarters no arrests were reported in either incident 
the congress of south african trade unions with which the 
transport union is affiliated said police indiscriminately 
attacked the workers when they got off the train without paying 
the statement by the congress the countrys largest and most 
militantly antiapartheid trade federation said police brutally 
assaulted the strikers when they fled to the union offices the 
union said the workers were unable to pay for their train tickets 
because they were on strike 
the dispute centers on a demand by the south african railways 
and harbor workers for the minimum wage to be increased to 570 a 
month from 230 other issues in dispute are the unions objection 
to possible privatization and the companys refusal to officially 
recognize the union 
the union claims a membership of 40000 of the total 180000 
black workers employed by the transport company 
the strike which has hit mainly the johannesburgpretoria area 
and the port city of durban is one of two bitter labor disputes 
that show no signs of resolution 
about 6000 black employees of south african breweries the 
countrys privately owned beer monopoly have been on strike for 
five weeks 
on wednesday the brewery workers union lowered its wage demand 
for the first time saying it would accept a 32 percent increase 
instead of a 38 percent increase but management maintained its 
refusal to change its final offer of a 16 percent raise 
seven deaths have been linked to that strike 
police officials also said thursday that 15 black activists were 
arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in alexandra a 
township adjoining johannesburg the meeting followed the 
announcement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission for 
a protest march in alexandra on saturday 
organizers hoped 30000 would join the march to demand new 
housing an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accrued 
during a threeyear rent boycott

a decision to tape virtually all 
telephone calls at state police barracks including calls made by 
suspects to their attorneys was made by top state police officials 
almost three years ago a newspaper reported thursday 
state police memorandums cited by the hartford courant 
contradict statements made by the former commander of the state 
police when he resigned on sunday 
lester j forst who also resigned his post as state public 
safety commissioner because of the controversy said his top 
officers werent aware of the scope of the taping 
there is no indication in the memorandums however that forst 
himself was aware of the taping system the courant reported 
the newspaper also cited inventory documents from february 1987 
and 1988 suggesting that state police played back tapes to check 
the quality of the recordings the documents do not make clear if 
police played back tapes of clientattorney calls 
the taping of all calls going in and out of state police 
barracks is the subject of fbi and federal grand jury 
investigations gov william a oneill has ordered a review of 
state and municipal police taping policies and a halt to recording 
of attorneyclient calls 
state police have insisted they did not listen to privileged 
calls between suspects and their attorneys and have claimed that 
the taping system was installed so police could verify details of 
calls for help for example 
the new state police commander bernard r sullivan declined to 
comment on the newspaper report and said he would wait until all 
investigations are completed 
state supreme court chief justice ellen a peters rejected a 
request by a state senator for an investigation into whether judges 
or lawyers knew of the taping system peters said if the senator 
had any evidence of that he should make it public 
meanwhile the state agreed thursday to a pleabargain in a 
waterbury trial where the existence of the taping system was first 
revealed 
a waterbury police detective charged with drunken driving and 
manslaughter for hitting a women agreed to plead guilty to 
negligent homicide with a motor vehicle and receive a fourmonth 
suspended sentence and one years probation the detectives 
lawywer had subpoenaed state police officials to testify about the 
taping system but the pleabargain eliminated that possibility 
in wallingford town attorney adam mantzaris said his towns 
police may have illegally taped phone conversations in the 
departments cellblock mayor william w dickinson jr ordered the 
taping halted tuesday 
and state police who investigated the case of a teenage girl 
charged in the killing of her mother will be asked to testify in 
hartford superior court friday whether they videotaped or recorded 
any conversations of the defendant or other witnesses 
according to the courant a dec 3 1986 memorandum sent by 
dominick console the civilian telecommunications chief for the 
department to lt henry bourgeois commanding officer of the state 
police communications center said it was time to remind the top 
management about the taping system and to decide what lines 
should be recorded 
a meeting apparently was held a week later on the matter 
a memorandum dated dec 12 1986 from capt ronald p mikulka 
commanding officer of technological support services to bourgeois 
and console said 
in accordance with a decision reached at the dec 10 1986 
staff meeting all telephone lines are to be recorded the only 
exception will be the troop lieutenants private line 
the memorandum instructs them to make arrangements to obtain 
and distribute appropriate labels to be affixed to troop phones 
which will notify users that all lines are taped 
the stickers never reached most telephones in police barracks 
and a policy requiring troopers to tell anyone using the telephones 
that their conversations would be recorded was never developed the

thousands of residents strolled along the 
newly intact san franciscooakland bay bridge on thursday saluting 
the workers who got it back in shape just a month after the 
earthquake 
the bridge is part of the family said frank lafontaine 59 
of daly city who uses it to visit friends in the east bay you 
really miss it 
repaired at a cost of about 25 million the bridge is slated 
to reopen to traffic at 1159 pm friday one month to the day 
after the devastating oct 17 quake if all goes well but 
officials decided a formal reopening celebration was in order and 
invited people to travel the bridge on foot thursday 
the ceremony featured crooner tony bennett singing his trademark 
i left my heart in san francisco a navy band with the national 
anthem and appearances by gov george deukmejian san francisco 
mayor art agnos and oakland mayor lionel wilson 
about 9200 people purchased 6 tickets for a bus ride to 
locations at either end of the bridge profits were slated for 
quake relief 
i was on a bus when the bridge broke about 150 yards from 
where it broke recalled susan palumbo 42 of san francisco as 
she stood on the bridge thursday the bus occupants had to walk 
off the bridge she said 
it was scary i didnt feel the quake but i waited for the 
aftershock to take the bridge down i feel safe now she said 
the bridge one of the mosttraveled in the world was carrying 
an average of more than 260000 vehicles every work day before the 
quake which caused a 50foot section of the upper deck to 
collapse it opened 53 years ago this week on nov 12 1936 
at the ceremony deukmejian thanked the people who have been 
working around the clock seven days a week in order for us to open 
up this bridge to help the literally millions of people who have 
depended upon it 
he said the reopening of would have a positive impact on the 
spirit of all of the people in the bay area and throughout 
california 
meanwhile a panel of engineers said the repairs have made the 
bridge as strong as it was before the 71 temblor but said that 
another similar quake would seriously damage the span again 
mother nature performed an experiment that showed the bridge 
was not designed adequately warned geologist robert e wallace 
chairman of the bay conservation and development commissions 
engineering criteria review board 
it failed in a very distant earthquake he said the quake 
was centered in the santa cruz mountains about 70 miles to the 
south 
the ceremony was held near the spot where the section of bridge 
collapsed smashing into the lower deck one person died when the 
car she was in fell into the gap 
the crowds were not allowed on the actual section that fell 
because concrete was in its last stages of hardening officials 
said 
shortly after the quake california department of transportation 
officials had said they hoped to have the bridge reopened by 
thanksgiving 
in the past month commuters who normally drove the bridge to 
work had to travel longer slower alternate routes or use mass 
transit 
the bay area rapid transit system which has an underground tube 
under the bay has set records during the bridge closure with as 
many as 345000 passengers riding bart trains some days

conservative fernando collor de mello on 
thursday was virtually guaranteed a berth in a runoff election for 
president and two leftist rivals battled for the second spot 
official and tv network tallies gave collor de mello about 26 
percent of the vote and an ample lead in wednesdays election the 
first free presidential balloting in 29 years 
with his elegant suits and good looks the 40yearold former 
governor of the tiny northeastern state of alagoas campaigned on a 
cleangovernment program that captured the imagination of many poor 
brazilians most of whom earn less than 25 a week 
none of the candidates was expected to obtain a majority and a 
runoff between the top two finishers was scheduled for dec 17 
in washington the state department said it was a truly 
significant day for brazil spokeswoman margaret tutwiler likened 
the elections to the developments sweeping eastern europe 
in considering the spread of democracy into other regions such 
as eastern europe we should also take note of what occurred in 
brazil yesterday she said in a statement 
we congratulate the people of brazil on what has been a truly 
significant day in their history she said we look forward to 
working with whomever they choose in the upcoming runoff election 
to be their next president 
official and tv network counts gave collor de mello a wide lead 
over radicalleftist luis inacio lula da silva and rival populist 
leonel brizola in wednesdays balloting 
an unofficial tally by brazils largest tv network globo tv 
which said it independently counted 573 percent of the returns 
from the countrys 82 million registered voters gave collor de 
mello 125 million votes or 265 percent of the total 
brizola of the centerleft democratic labor party was 
comfortably in second place with 86 million votes or 183 
percent the network said 
da silva a former union president of the marxistoriented 
workers party was trailing in third with 75 million votes about 
16 percent 
the governments official votecounting center far behind 
unofficial tallies because of apparent computer problems issued 
partial results showing da silva in second 
it said that with only 2068 percent of the votes counted 
collor de mello was leading with 2691 percent da silva was second 
with 1727 percent and brizola was third with 1591 percent 
those were the last official results to be issued thursday 
the impending runoff raised the possibility of an alliance 
between the leftist candidates to defeat collor de mello the two 
insulted each other during the campaign and dismissed the idea of 
joining forces 
brizola overtook da silva on thursday in the globo tv count 
network analysts said brizolas surge was due to a predicted strong 
showing in the heavily populated states of rio de janeiro and rio 
grande do sul where he was governor 
however globo tv analysts said da silva a charismatic labor 
leader backed by the progressive wing of brazils powerful roman 
catholic church could close the gap when votes from remote 
interior precincts came in 
sen mario covas of the leftofcenter brazilian social 
democracy party was fourth with 52 million votes in the network 
count but was not expected to overtake brizola or da silva 
the supreme electoral court released an official partial result 
thursday night based on only 12 percent of the votes counted it 
showed collor de mello leading with 24 million votes da silva 
second with around 16 million and brizola third with some 15 
million votes 
mauricio mello head of the electoral courts computer systems 
said the final tally would be announced in five days 
collor de mello who had led in polls since april has sharply 
criticized president jose sarney calling the 59yearold leader 
corrupt and incompetent and blaming him for brazils 1300 percent 
inflation sarney who by law cannot run for reelection said he 
will sue the candidate for slander 
the new president takes office march 15 for a fiveyear term 
brazils last direct presidential election was in 1960 when 
janio quadros was elected quadros quit after seven months in 
office and three years later the armed forces took power in a 
rightwing coup 
the generals banned direct voting for presidential election 
although limited regional elections were allowed sarney a 
civilian took office in 1985 in an electoral college controlled by 
the generals

utility poles had been snapped like twigs 
the national weather service said the tornado path had covered 
between eight and 10 miles and that its wind speeds were as high as 
250 mph

blender and putting it on liquefy said rescue worker bob caraway

area that was otherwise largely without power tall cranes lifted 
the heavy rubble while workers with flashlights picked through the 
smaller pieces 
as daybreak came people began returning to the scene some to 
look for valuables in ravaged cars or businesses others simply out

killed along airport boulevard a busy thoroughfare that seemed to 
be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march the other victim 
perished on the citys outskirts authorities said

solidarity leader lech walesa declared 
thursday the iron curtain is no more but also said the west 
will be to blame if polands experiment in democracy fails for lack 
of economic support 
if we do not succeed in evolution a revolution may come 
walesa told a packed luncheon at the national press club before 
leaving for new york on the next leg of his weeklong visit to the 
united states 
lionized during four days in the nations capital walesa met 
with president bush addressed a joint session of congress and 
received the cheers of us labor leaders the president hailed him 
as americas special guest and congress gave him repeated 
standing ovations 
he also found time to tape a 30second commercial for the 
aflcios union yes advertising campaign in the ad he speaks 
in polish through a translator until the end when he grins 
switches to english and gives the union yes slogan 
the taping took about 90 minutes partly because walesa had such 
trouble pronouncing union 
in manhattan on thursday night the 1983 nobel peace prize 
winner received a freedom award from the international rescue 
committee a nonsectarian voluntary agency that runs relief 
medical and resettlement for refugees fleeing political religious 
or racial persecution 
past freedom award recipients included winston churchill george 
meany hubert humphrey and elie wiesel 
walesa told an estimated 700 government officials diplomats 
industrial leaders and private citizens at the award dinner 
please care for this country because this country is a beacon of 
hope for people elsewhere 
at the press club earlier walesa repeated his call for 
americans to invest in poland to protect the fragile beginnings of 
democracy walesa said he would not be to blame if the peaceful 
evolution degenerates into chaos 
i will defend myself and my defense will be as follows 
we have done everything we have fulfilled all your conditions 
and we have stretched out our hands but there was no other hand to 
take it 
animated despite his hectic schedule the solidarity leader 
bantered with his press club audience and said polish reforms so 
far represent a beautiful house of cards that will not survive 
without economic concrete 
the iron curtain is no more declared walesa an emissary 
for the east blocs first noncommunist led government 
we have fought and we have won but the victory is mostly a 
theoretical victory i call it a beautiful house of cards 
any wind could destroy this house of cards if we want a real 
victory we need to build a strong foundation under it by pouring 
economic concrete 
we want to make business deals said walesa who met earlier 
in the day with commerce secretary robert mosbacher agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter and representatives of a dozen american 
corporations 
at their meeting earlier mosbacher declared walesa an honorary 
texan and presented him a white stetson hat 
all heroes all good guys wear white hats said mosbacher a 
former houston businessman 
asked at the luncheon if he had achieved everything he wanted 
during the visit walesa referred to his one passion outside of 
solidarity fishing 
obviously ladies and gentlemen you have to remember that i am 
like a fisherman i caught a fish this big he said first 
stretching out his arm then gesturing with his hand a catch only 
the size of his forearm 
the crowd guffawed 
i talk a lot i ask for a lot and of course i already know 
that i cannot accomplish everything that the results will be 
limited 
but he added a few minutes later 
it seems to me that i am being received with great sympathy 
and with understanding so there is a chance that we will 
succeed i hope that the fish will be a larger one than the one i 
have shown 
congress was taking steps this week to help finance the polish 
reforms as the senate voted tuesday to authorize 657 million in 
economic aid to poland over three years and 81 million for nearby 
hungary which also is dismantling its centrally controlled economy 
the house went further approving an initial oneyear 
installment of 533 million for the two soviet bloc nations

warplanes bombed rebel 
positions in parts of san salvador and troops battled guerrillas 
block by block thursday in efforts to break the largest offensive 
of the decadeold civil war 
armed men meanwhile entered the grounds of jose simeon canas 
central american university before dawn and killed and mutilated 
six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her 15yearold daughter 
the government denied responsibility for the killings and said 
an investigation was under way in washington white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater condemned the killings as outrageous 
reports on fighting in the countryside were sketchy but at 
least 800 people have died and 1600 have been wounded since the 
offensive in all 14 provinces began saturday night 
president vinicio cerezo of guatemala proposed thursday that the 
organization of american states send a delegation to el salvador to 
negotiate a ceasefire he said such a truce should be supervised 
by un forces 
guerrilla leaders have acknowledged they cannot win the 
10yearold war militarily but launched the offensive to prove the 
army also could not win and that rightist president alfredo 
cristiani would be unable to govern without a role in government 
for their farabundo marti national liberation front 
although only 1500 guerrillas are thought to be involved in the 
attack in san salvador the entire capital of 1 million people 
seemed besieged virtually nothing was open and the sounds of 
combat were everywhere a37 attack jets screamed overhead 
followed by thundering explosions as bombs dropped 
we were caught in the crossfire said angel erazo clutching 
a kitten on one hand and a bag of clothes in the other it was a 
horrible night 
residents of one neighborhood who had been without food for days 
looted a marketplace 
we have no food no money nowhere to go sobbed adilia 
hernandez from zacamil a northern neighborhood held by the 
guerrillas since saturday night 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group said 
50 civilians took refuge thursday in a suburban church the church 
was surrounded by troops and there are three jesuit priests inside 
the rights group said the report could not immediately be 
independently confirmed 
uniformed security officers late thursday raided a downtown 
office of the lutheran church and arrested 12 foreigners including 
four us citizens who work with the church said michel gagne a 
consular officer in the canadian embassy 
gagne said the foreigners who included a canadian and a west 
german minister were detained by the treasury police but the 
police would not confirm the report 
he identified the americans arrested as paula brentlinger a 
physician and thomas gabriel a nurse both from seattle bradley 
fields a social worker from san diego and paul fitch a volunteer 
whose hometown was unknown 
earlier thursday a priest quoted two witnesses as saying 
uniformed government troops killed the six roman catholic priests 
the government denied the accusation and said the the crime was 
intended to destablize the democratic process and increase even 
more the climate of anguish created by the rebel offensive 
the guerrilla offensive was launched three days after the 
guerrillas canceled peace talks with the government following a 
oct 30 terrorist bombing that left 10 dead at a union hall 
the guerrillas called for an uprising to topple cristiani the 
usbacked government has declared the rebel offensive a failure 
and insisted the guerrillas do not control any significant 
territory 
thousands of salvadorans have been forced to flee their houses 
and many have said they blame the guerrillas for their misery 
the slayings at central american university were the most 
significant mass killing since 1980 when seven leftist politicians 
and three us nuns and a lay worker were killed by government 
forces 
those killings helped kick off a cycle of violence that has led 
to more than 70000 deaths including tens of thousands killed by 
rightwing death squads 
on thursday the rebels appeared to have taken new ground in the 
northern neighborhood of mejicanos but fell back in soyapango on 
the eastern side of the city fighting also continued in zacamil 
on the north 
several hundred guerrilla fighters had moved down overnight from 
the heights above mejicanos another northern neighborhood they 
were in control of the main streets thursday including a market 
that besieged residents began looting 
in soyapango the guerrillas appeared to have backed down after 
intense housetohouse combat but the entire capital seemed under 
fire the sounds of combat were everywhere the government has 
imposed a state of siege and a curfew and the rebels have declared 
a ban on all traffic 
the guerrillas estimated to have 7000 fulltime fighters and 
11000 backups nationwide are heavily outnumbered by the 
56000strong salvadoran army and other security forces

salt long believed a cause of high blood 
pressure may have the opposite effect on some people on strict 
lowsalt diets a study says but other doctors insist its still 
better to keep your hands off the shaker 
dr brent egan director of the hypertension unit at the medical 
college of wisconsin said his study suggests that strictly 
limiting salt intake could be bad for people with normal blood 
pressure he said he believes that the american heart associations 
suggestion of limiting daily salt consumption to 7 grams or about 
1 teaspoons is safe 
but he said further study is necessary before more stringent 
rules are adopted for the general population i think there are 
some people who are harmed by severe to moderate salt restriction 
at least in the short term said egan who based his findings on

trying to keep pace with the changes sweeping 
europe the italian communist party has taken a revolutionary step 
of its own 
after months of debate party leader achille occhetto has put 
the machinery in motion to drop the word communist from the 
party name eliminate the hammer and sickle from its symbol and 
present the skeleton as a new force grouping leftist parties 
occhetto is hoping the change will reverse the partys sagging 
political fortunes and end the stigma that has kept it out of the 
national government for 42 years 
it is a gamble that could change the political map in a country 
where one party the christian democrats has led or dominated all 
governments since the end of world war ii

owen ryan envisioned party animals as a fun 
way to market wheat and sesameseed party crackers shaped like 
ducks deer pigs and rabbits 
what he got was a dogged legal scrap with beer giant 
anheuserbusch inc which sued ryan contending that people would 
confuse the crackers with its beerpromoting mascot spuds 
mackenzie the original party animal 
this is financial bullying and harassment plain and simple 
its like a bully who goes to a playground and wants to take your 
ball because hes bigger said ryan founder of owen ryan and 
associates a marketing and consulting company in new york 
can you believe that pooch can bite so hard he said but 
every dog has its day 
anheuserbusch which makes 785 million barrels of budweiser 
and other beer a year and controls 40 percent of the us beer 
market declined comment through its attorneys and peter fowler of 
fleischman hillard a public relations company 
ryan said the dogfight pits a pipsqueak businessman with five 
employees and no mascot against a company with 97 billion in 
annual sales 41000 employees and spuds an english bull terrier 
who has promoted beer stuffed animals beach towels tshirts and 
hats since april 1985 
ryan says he has been unable to market his party crackers 
because leery manufacturers want all the legal questions resolved 
first and a protracted battle could last years 
theyre using the courts to restrict competition ryan said 
this is a free country my product should have the opportunity to 
succeed or fail in the marketplace we want the ability to market 
without this cloud hanging over our head 
anheuserbusch sued in february 1988 to stop use of the party 
animals trademark arguing that the snack food could be confused 
with the products of one of its subsidiaries eagle snacks inc in 
court papers the brewer said it believes that it will be 
damaged 
but the courts already have ruled the trademarks and products 
are distinguishable 
there is no likelihood of confusion according to a 
threemember panel of the us trademark trial and appeal board 
which dismissed part of the brewers claim in a summary judgment 
given may 30 
however the board said a trial would be needed to decide one 
remaining question under interstate commerce law whether ryan 
ever actually marketed his crackers to consumers ryan claims the 
issue is a technicality but anheuserbusch has filed stacks of 
legal motions against ryan in an attempt to keep him from using the 
name 
ryan said he first used his trademark on aug 15 1987 he 
argued that the term party animal was generically defined in 
1983 by the dictionary of american slang and has been used by walt 
disney studios tiffany amp co jewelers and greeting card makers and 
by others to describe politicians such as john tower 
his lawyer thinks its a case of a little guy getting into a 
corporate giants doghouse 
spuds is a pit bull who wont loosen his grip said jay 
begler ryans attorney the court has already said that people 
who see an animal cracker shaped like a duck arent going to think 
of spuds mackenzie but they dont want to let go 
i think this is something the american public can sink its 
teeth into if youll pardon the expression begler said 
trademarks are jealously guarded by companies that spend 
millions of dollars to cultivate symbols so the public can identify 
with a product whether its beer cars fast food or clothes 
anheuserbusch lost a 1984 case after suing the florist 
association of greater cleveland for trademark infringement and 
unfair competition because it sold stems with the slogan this 
buds for you 
the court sided with the florists saying consumers would not 
confuse beer with flowers it also said the promotion of rosebuds 
did not disparage the beer producer or its product 
ryan has promised to keep fighting he formed a party animals 
defense fund to help pay his legal costs 
psychologically there are times ive just felt blown away 
he said but this is my livelihood and im just not a quitter 
if that dog wants another black eye hes come to the right 
guy

when the berlin wall went up the initial 
response from john f kennedys white house was as cautious as 
president bush was when it began coming down 28 years later 
kennedy was silent bush subdued kennedy faced a crisis that 
threatened cold war explosion he had to worry about war bush 
seemed bent on playing down any celebration of victory for the 
west lest the united states seem to be crowing 
in both cases the administrations clearly were taken by 
surprise by abrupt moves on the communist side one adverse one 
welcomed 
democrats have criticized bush for what they say is too timid a 
response now some republicans complained in 1961 that kennedy was 
not responding forcefully enough to a soviet threat that seemed to 
imperil western access to west berlin 
that access and the freedom of west berlin not the wall was 
the issue that threatened major eastwest confrontation 
aug 13 1961 was a brilliant midsummer sunday at hyannis port 
on cape cod and kennedy was headed for an afternoon cruise when 
word came that the communists had sealed the border of east berlin 
and started building a barbedwire barricade 
he was briefed by his military and security aides then resumed 
his weekend holiday and spent five hours cruising nantucket sound 
with his family his spokesman said there would be no comment on 
berlin 
back at the white house the following week kennedy put us 
forces on alert ordered a partial callup of military reservists 
and sent 1500 soldiers to reinforce the us garrison in west 
berlin he said later that the troops were hostage to americas 
intent to maintain access to west berlin 
while the united states denounced the border closing and the 
barricades that halted a flood of refugees and locked east germans 
into their communist state the crisis centered on soviet demands 
and statements that seemed to threaten western highway and air 
routes to west berlin across 110 miles of east german territory 
kennedy sent vice president lyndon b johnson to west berlin to 
declare that the united states would fight if necessary to defend 
freedom there and to greet the troops convoyed across east german 
territory without incident on aug 20 1961 
there were to be more soviet threats to impede western access to 
berlin but it was not blocked 
the wall became a symbol of oppression western protests a 
litany it went up in 1961 because east germans were fleeing their 
communist country about 3000 of them a day it was reopened this 
month by an east german government seeking to stem a new wave of 
refugees and hoping that free travel would persuade many of them 
not to flee 
from kennedys day to this every american president has 
challenged the communists to tear down their wall bush did so in 
mainz west germany last spring 
but when the border was opened bushs response was bland and 
bureaucratic it was as though he had decided to play it safe by 
playing it down and overdid the role he called the reopening a 
dramatic happening for freedom and said he was elated although he 
didnt look it im just not an emotional kind of a guy he 
explained 
in televised contrast came the indelible image of john f 
kennedy in west berlin calling the divided city a symbol of 
freedom everywhere declaring in a boston accent that he took pride 
in proclaiming ich bin ein berliner that kennedy speech was 
replayed again and again as the berlin wall came open it was not 
an early response to the wall kennedy delivered it on june 26 
1963 nearly two years after the communists walled in east berlin 
in the days after the border was sealed in 1961 the 
administration accused the soviet union of cynically and 
irresponsibly sealing the eastern sector of berlin in violation of 
the agreement among the world war ii allies 
i dont feel the situation in east berlin is satisfactory in 
any way kennedy said at a news conference on aug 30 and we 
have made clear that we have do not consider it satisfactory 
eloquence came later 
bush has said that he will be imaginative yet prudent in dealing 
with the new situation in the east so far the emphasis has been on 
prudence 
the administration has offered to help west germany house and 
care for refugees there have been no major policy moves 
senate democratic leader george mitchell urged bush to go to 
west berlin to express american exhilaration the white house said 
bush has no such plans sen robert j dole of kansas the 
republican leader complained about an increasing level of 
democratic carping at bushs actions and words on eastern europe 
we have no apologies or concern with anything that weve done 
at this point said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
i would simply say that all the actions that we have taken thus 
far we believe have been appropriate have not been offensive 
and have had the desired effect of offering our support without 
inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process 
backwards

economist nicole ballenger says northsouth 
agricultural trade in the western hemisphere is heating up and 
talks to liberalize global rules could add more fuel to the flames 
the global talks are part of the socalled uruguay round under 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade and are scheduled to 
conclude by the end of next year 
much of the controversy in the talks has centered on the us 
quest for phasing out tradedistorting agricultural subsidies and 
other impediments to free trade 
the us goal has drawn some support at least in principle but 
has been sharply criticized by others including the 12nation 
european economic community which has been lambasted for years by 
us critics for its big farm subsidies protective import 
restrictions and subsidized exports 
ballenger who is assigned to the agriculture departments 
economic research service speaks of another dimension namely the 
rising competition among western hemisphere countries in the 
agricultural export market 
us trade problems in the hemisphere have increased in the 
1980s turning a relatively placid situation into a sometimes 
stormy mix of changing relationships ballenger says 
countries that once were only customers or sources of us 
agricultural imports now challenge american traders for shares in 
world soybean and grain markets the united states remains the 
biggest farm exporter and importer in the hemisphere but 
significant shifts already have occurred 
for example until 1980 the united states had a growing 
positive agricultural trade balance with its most important trading 
partner canada ballenger says in this months farmline 
magazine since 1983 however the us trade balance with canada 
has deteriorated and in 1985 it turned negative 
on the export side of agricultural trade the united states has 
faced growing competition since 1980 from western hemisphere 
countries particularly argentina and brazil 
these countries have boosted their food exports in the 
hemisphere and the rest of the world while their agricultural 
trade surpluses with the united states have continued to grow 
ballenger says 
in the late 1960s when total us agricultural trade with the 
western hemisphere was less than 21 billion a year exports made 
up almost 12 billion of the total as the total us trade value 
rose the export share kept pace 
by the early 1980s when yearly us agricultural trade in the 
hemisphere averaged 795 billion the export share was 738 
billion but that was the highwater mark 
in 1985 with a total us trade value of 953 billion exports 
made up 585 billion and in 1986 the most recent year for which 
figures are available exports made up 519 billion of the total 
us hemisphere agricultural trade of 1024 billion 
some parts of the region such as mexico and the andean 
central american and caribbean countries face similar economic 
circumstances ballenger said the demand for their 
agricultural exports is growing quite slowly while their own food 
needs are increasing rapidly 
the united states is looking at the recently concluded trade 
agreement with canada to help stabilize trade with its northern 
neighbor and attention now is shifting to mexico and other 
countries to the south 
ballenger said agricultural trade between the united states and 
mexico has shown an almost opposite trend to that with canada 
in the early 1980s mexico surpassed canada as the largest 
market in the hemisphere for us agricultural products the annual 
agricultural trade balance went from an average of 2734 million 
deficit for the united states in the late 1960s to an average 
yearly surplus of 8273 million in 198084 
in 198586 however the pendulum swung back she said 
the united states again ran an agricultural trade deficit with 
mexico which reached 940 million in 1986 
but now the united states again has an agricultural trade 
surplus with mexico largely because of mexican production 
shortfalls ballenger said 
meanwhile brazil has emerged as a major us competitor in 
196569 the annual us agricultural trade deficit with brazil was 
399 million by 198084 the average yearly deficit was 1259 
billion she said 
with brazil taking on us soybean shippers and argentina moving 
into world grain markets the united states is finding rougher 
going in some of its old reliable markets in the hemisphere itself 
particularly in mexico and the andean and caribbean countries 
the recent proliferation of accusations of unfair trading 
practices that the united states has brought against brazil and 
argentina for example reflects us concerns regarding its role 
in western hemisphere agricultural trade ballenger said 
trade liberalization under gatt the international rulemaking 
group that oversees global trade practices could lead to 
potentially serious disruptions for some latin american countries 
as well as significant benefits 
if freer trade were to lead to higher grain prices as some 
studies suggest food importing countries could face difficult 
adjustments at least in the short run she said but some 
latin american countries could also see sharp gains in their net 
export earnings as prices for key exports particularly beef and 
sugar strengthen 
ballenger said an even more important issue also must be 
resolved the practice of many hemisphere countries of having 
government marketing boards and import licensing programs that 
control trade and internal prices of agricultural products 
the extent to which latin american agricultural policies would 
be affected depends not only on the outcome of the trade talks 
but also on the extent to which developing countries will be 
expected to comply with new gatt rules she said

after the big weekend shopping spree on the 
other side of the wall workday mornings in east berlin are 
dizzyingly different from what they used to be 
its a craziness confided otto a construction supervisor 
who would just as soon not give his last name you wait for the 
cement delivery it doesnt come the truck driver has just gone to 
west germany maybe so has the foreman everybody loafs sits down 
on the job east berliners are good at that 
the best in the world according to james lyman a visiting 
london textile salesman who regards himself as something of an 
authority on gold bricking 
there is no job incentive he said you work for the state 
at low pay on antiquated machinery with poor materials and there 
is almost no way you can get fired there is a big labor shortage 
the youngest and the most skilled are leaving 
things are different too at the big supermarket ho the 
initials of the stateowned handel organization 
no lines today at the checkout said greta meinischmidt 
squeezing a shriveled apple then a scrawny cuban banana very 
small like our eggs perhaps i wait for my niece to shop across 
the wall 
there were no lines either at the meat counter where frau 
meinischmidt passed up the single tray of yellowish pork cutlets 
that less than a month ago would have tempted factory workers to 
call in sick to join the queue 
in the last month everything you heard about east berlin has 
become obsolete cautioned a yugoslav journalist colleague from 
the cambodian days now covering the east german capital now 
because travel is permitted there are long lines to change money 
you wait an hour for a taxi at the bahnhof and there is gridlock 
around the police stations where passports and exit visas are 
issued i never saw so many ddr plates people are coming in from 
all the country and parking where they like the police just 
smile 
the government smile order as my driver karl called it has 
dramatically quickened the bureaucratic pace at checkpoint charlie 
on tuesday it had taken nearly two hours to cross to the east as 
border guards meticulously searched every trunk and glove 
compartment now they just checked the passports and waved us 
through with a smile and a salute 
a convoy of six army trucks rumbled down unter den linden from 
the direction of the brandenburg gate and a babyfaced soldier 
leaned out from under the green canvas roof to wave at a pretty 
fraulein in a black leather mini skirt she ignored him but a 
schoolboy waved back 
border guards said walter the young waiter in the grand 
hotels glassedin coffee shop theyre under a lot less tension 
now they can be friendly 
he told the latest wall joke the guard dogs are being 
retrained as drugsniffing dogs 
west berlin already has a severe drug problem and is regarded as 
one of the most lucrative markets for crack dealers like street 
crime cocaine is rare on the other side of the wall but 
alcoholism is a national problem 
beer and vodka available for less than two marks about 110 
a shot are the opium of the masses as in belfast northern 
ireland you see men and sometimes women staggering around before 
11 am 
we live in a poorer shabbier berlin conceded a barber with 
the name rolf over his comb pocket that is why we come back 
through those holes in the wall life is cheaper food is simpler 
and rents are subsidized 
a blue collar worker in east berlin putting in a 43hour week 
gets a monthly wage of 1000 marks 540 his counterpart a few 
blocks to the west makes that much in a 35hour week but ernst 
east pays only 34 marks a month for a twobedroom flat while willie 
west is lucky to find a oneroom studio for 1000 marks a month 
jah thats zoe chimed in the elderly customer in the 
chair but our buildings are all falling apart because the low 
rent cant cover ordinary depreciation and those new apartment 
houses are very poorly constructed 
both blamed shoddy workmanship on the slaves as east 
berliners call the thousands of vietnamese cuban and mozambique 
gastarbiters imported workers living in barracks and doing 
lowpaid unskilled jobs at the many construction sites around town 
in addition to the huge housing blocks rising not far from the 
wall the government seems intent on restoring berlins prewar 
glory rebuilding bombedout palaces churches and the old town 
that flourished in the era of prussian kings and even some of 
office buildings designed by albert speer hitlers architect 
it takes an east berliner more than dacade to save 10000 marks 
for one of those tiny east german cars almost as long as it takes 
for delivery but automobile exhaust pollution is already a public 
health problem

so is pubic health itself added karl as he drove past the 
huge charite hospital where he was born every day more and more 
doctors and nurses are leaving how can the state survive 
life is far from being a cabaret but the swinging nightclub 
district off friedrichstrasse that christopher isherwoods sally 
bowles made famous is coming alive again with movie houses and 
theaters crowding the somber east bloc embassies 
like haircuts opera and theater are twothirds cheaper over 
here rudi pointed out we get world famous artists and 
sometimes we see films like et and out of africa ahead of 
west berlin 
that morning the box office had opened at bertolt brechts 
restored deutsche theater for a new production of brendan behans 
die geisel the hostage 
and there are cabarets my yugoslav comrade advised in the 
fivestar hotels for foreign guests paying in hard currency here 
there are no street walkers like you see on the kurfurstendamm but 
call girls work the big hotels oddly the price is the same 190 
marks west german only bitte 
there is one mildy smutty magazine but staid east berlin has 
nothing to compete with the sex shops or strip joints that drew 
long lines of wall crossers over the weekend in west berlin so the 
question now looms how do you keep em passionate for factory 
production quotas after theyve seen erotes berlin super sexy 
video and sauna parlor 
they give us football and circuses laughed walter the 
waiter who has no fondness for the police but is a passionate fan 
of the dynamos the highly rated east berlin police soccer team 
which is called a football team here and cant wait for circus 
busch to come back to town with those dancing russian bears 
east berlins christmas fair now rising near alexanderplatz 
with amusement rides clowns and games for the kids will draw 
thousands from the other side of the wall but there already is a 
parade of toys from that direction 
east german toys are really quite charming said a us army 
sergeant who has been in west berlin for six years hand crafted 
things like music boxes and nutcrackers but now that the wall is 
open the electronic stuff labeled batteries not included are all 
the rage over here

here you are in the age of aids preparing 
for surgery that may require a transfusion is the blood available 
from the local blood bank safe should you have some of your own 
set aside 
yes and yes doctors say 
what if you just want some of your blood on hand in case youre 
hit by a truck or need an emergency operation is that worthwhile 
probably not say the american red cross and tradtional blood 
banks 
yes say those who freeze and store blood for a fee 
a blood transfusion is the most intimate contact you can have 
with another human being it is more intimate than sex said dr 
joseph feldschuh of new york who founded an independent frozen 
blood lab in 1985 the food and drug administration says 18 such 
companies are licensed in the united states 
freezing blood for longterm storage is nothing new the red 
cross has been doing it without charge since 1964 for people with 
rare blood and has 10000 pints in frozen storage at 56 centers 
nondonors may use it in emergencies 
companies began getting into freezing four or five years ago 
because of aids anxiety but there has been a low level of such 
activity said dr toby simon president of the american 
association of blood banks 
the pentagon kicked off the worlds largest frozen blood program 
in october a fiveyear project to draw 45000 pints a year toward 
stockpiling 225000 pints domestically and abroad for use during 
combat or disasters 
medical authorities including the american medical association 
agree that whether the concern is disease or simply the best match 
the safest blood you can receive is your own but freezing blood on 
speculation is another matter 
liquid blood has a shelf life of 42 days while frozen blood can 
be kept 20 years or more but dealing with frozen blood which must 
be thawed and cleaned of chemicals added during freezing is 
expensive and there is no guarantee it will be available where and 
when it is needed simon said 
most us transfusions are for surgery and there is generally 
time for a patient to have blood drawn a few weeks beforehand he 
said 
in an emergency the chance of contracting disease through a 
transfusion pales beside the risk of dying without it said dr 
arthur kellermann director of emergency services at the regional 
medical center at memphis and a professor of emergency medicine at 
the university of tennessee memphis 
but james w jarvis who runs a miamibased blood storage 
company said setting aside a permanent supply can provide a 
layer of protection for your family and yourself that is not 
otherwise there his personal blood storage of america inc 
recently opened an office near the federal express air shipment hub 
in memphis guaranteeing delivery anywhere in the country in six 
hours 
six hours can be too long in an emergency kellerman said we 
literally may need to give a patient blood within five or 10 
minutes of coming in the door emergency rooms often lack time 
even to crossmatch a patients blood and must simply give typeo 
the socalled universal donor he said 
the red cross and military frozen blood programs have nothing to 
do with fear of disease said dr gerald sandler the red cross 
medical director the risk of getting aids through a transfusion is 
about one in 100000 better than the odds of getting through 
your operation he said 
a greater statistical risk is hepatitis with the chances of 
infection at two to four in 100 per pint of blood a new screening 
test to be used starting next year is expected to reduce that to 
one in a hundred or less 
those risks are enough feldschuh said for concern his idant 
laboratories will store a pint of blood for 1250 a month plus 
85 in drawing and testing fees and about 45 for processing when 
its time to use the blood 
at personal blood storage it costs 295 to store a pint for 
four years and 4 a month after that additional charges totaling 
125 are likely when the blood is used plus any shipping said 
spokeswoman laura hardy 
on average a person getting a transfusion gets four pints says 
the red cross which collects half of the 12 million pints of blood 
drawn annually in the united states it puts the average cost of a 
pint of blood at 52 hospital fees may add 50 to that said bob 
rigney of the blood bank association 
most medical insurance does not pay for storing blood on 
speculation but generally covers all costs when its time to use 
the blood said jarvis whose company has freezers in florida and 
south carolina as well as memphis 
he wouldnt say how many customers he has or how much blood is 
in the freezers idant a subsidiary of daxor corp which runs 
what it bills as the worlds largest frozen sperm bank also 
wouldnt release those figures 
its not a business where anybody is going to make money for 
quite a while i feel this is the wave of the future 
feldschuh said 
the issue of frozen storage aside the red cross and american 
association of blood banks are trying to convince people to set 
aside their own blood prior to surgery for what is called 
autologous transfusions besides being safer for the patients 
autologous donations reduce the demand on blood banks 
there was a dramatic increase for several years for autologous 
donations but its kind of leveled off simon said were not 
certain whether its being optimally utilized everywhere or not 
in 1987 member hospitals blood banks and doctors drew 283000 
autologous pints a 55 percent increase over 1986 figures and 
1986 was a 50 percent jump over 1985 said spokesman rigney he 
did not have later figures 
the red cross last year drew 116400 autologous pints compared 
with 5500 in 1985 and hospitals with active surgical departments 
have enouraged it 
for autologous blood drawn prior to surgery it is reasonable 
sandler said for many patients to give blood two or three times a 
week in building up a stock of five or six pints two years ago he 
said the red cross checked on 3000 people who had their own blood 
in frozen storage because of rare types and found that 20 of them 
had actually needed transfusions 
of the 20 out of the 3000 every one of them could have done 
it in a much much less expensive way of waiting to have blood 
drawn until they knew they needed surgery said sandler who 
worries that companies sales pitches will weaken public confidence 
in traditional blood banks you cant market to the public the 
concept of freezing your own blood without marketing fear of the 
blood that most people in the community have to use 
we are not playing on anybodys fears jarvis said we are 
taking the entrepreneurial spirit that has built this country and 
applying it to science and medicine

crack cocaine use has been linked to an 
increase in syphilis that could blossom to epidemic proportions 
like aids has say medical researchers calling for more agressive 
education and treatment efforts 
pediatric syphilis jumped 128 percent from 329 cases in 1985 to 
751 last year as the number of new infections overall climbed 48 
percent from 27131 to 40117 according to the national centers 
for disease control 
even without aids congenital syphilis has devastating effects 
on children for every case of a child born with the disease there 
are two or three cases of stillborns and spontaneous miscarriages 
that should be included in statistics said dr h hunter 
handsfield director of the seattleking county division of 
sexually transmitted diseases 
the increase coincides with the emergence of both aids and crack 
the same behavior that places someone at risk for aids also 
places them at risk for syphilis said peggy clarke formerly 
assistant commissioner of the new york city aids program now 
executive director of the american social health association in 
durham nc a prevention advocacy group people in sexual 
relationships with drug users are at risk for syphilis and hiv 
so far both illicit drug use primarily crack and 
prostitution have been found to be risk factors for syphilis and 
people using crack have been more likely to be infected said dr 
ken gershman of the cdc staff 
the link between crack prostitution and syphilis was documented 
in studies in connecticut and philadelphia public health workers 
who interviewed infected patients found crack use and prostitution 
widespread among them syphilis rates rose 70 percent from 
19841987 in connecticut and 74 percent in philadelphia 
the emergence of syphilis among prostitutes drug users and 
their sexual contacts may be a widespread national phenomenon 
the cdc concluded 
although syphilis is not yet an epidemic specialists point to 
aids as an example of what a disease can do within a decade almost 
unknown before 1981 it has infected more than 100000 americans 
since then killing nearly 65000 
after nearly two decades of steadily declining syphilis rates 
new infections known as primary syphilis began rising again in 
1985 about the same year law enforcement officials first 
encountered crack 
the upswing is confined almost exclusively to black inner city 
neighborhoods according to the cdc in fact the overall infection 
rate among whites has continued to decrease during the 1980s 
gershman said 
the sexually transmitted disease first identified in the 1400s 
is difficult to detect it is characterized by a genital chancre 
or sore which disappears sometimes for years it is rarely fatal 
in adults if identified and treated in children and particularly 
newborns congenital syphilis often causes severe brain damage 
blindness deafness or even death if undetected 
in some cases we never know how severely the child is 
affected said handsfield a childs iq level could be 90 
instead of 110 or it could stunt growth in other cases the child 
can remain in a deep irreversible coma 
the combination of aids and syphilis has made detection and 
treatment of each more difficult each disease affects the other 
and the hiv virus makes it harder to diagnose and treat syphilis 
handsfield said 
although evidence exists that children are being born with both 
aids and syphilis statistics for concurrent cases are not 
available gershman said 
confirming infection in newborns is especially difficult because 
detection of syphilis as with the hiv virus that causes aids 
depends on identifying the antibodies produced to fight the disease 
instead of the disease itself a baby testing positive for syphilis 
antibodies may not develop the disease 
the dilemma for pediatricians handsfield said is do you 
treat the baby with a massive penicillin dose knowing 10 percent of 
cases are not infected or do you take a cautious approach and use 
a mild dose waiting for more tests 
in practice they choose the aggressive approach he said the 
danger from a large penicillin dose is relatively minor and 
these mothers some of them are drug addicts prostitutes have a 
very good chance of not showing up again after they give birth you 
say to yourself as long as ive got the baby i may as well put 
him in the hospital for 10 days and not worry about whether the 
mother comes back

stock market reform legislation pending before 
congress doesnt outlaw program trading but thats all right with 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden 
i dont think it gives us the authority to ban program trading 
per se breeden said of the securities markets stabilization act 
of 1989 rather he said it allows the sec to single out 
specific harmful practices including those associated with 
program trading 
breeden said wednesday he supports the recently amended bill now 
before the house energy and commerce committee it would allow the 
sec to curtail trading practices found to be manipulative or 
abusive 
critics of program trading in which enormous blocks of stocks 
are bought or sold in a wink of an eye via computer programs say 
it can lead to volatility sharp price rises and drops which in 
turn scares small investors out of the market 
and that say the critics makes it hard for us companies to 
sell securities and raise capital 
if the bill is passed said breeden the sec could then define 
rules that would bar specific practices that we deem to be harmful 
and contributing to excessive volatility and those practices could 
include program trading 
the bill must be passed by the energy and commerce committee 
before going to the house floor congressional leaders have said 
they want to adjourn for the holidays next week 
a similar bill that does not deal with program trading is 
pending before the senate banking committee 
breeden told a group of reporters at sec headquarters that the 
controversial computerdriven trading strategy is only a symptom 
of bigger market problems 
i think we need a close look at the whole issue of volatility 
and the factors that help produce it and the elements that may be 
at work id like to make sure that before we treat only the 
symptom that we also are aware of what the disease is he said 
originally the house bill would have allowed the sec to 
intervene when it considered trading practices to be 
disruptive but members of the telecommunications and finance 
subcomitee argued that the word was too vague 
breeden said he thought the debate over program trading had 
caused discussion to stray from the big issues of this bill 
two provisions that would require large traders to report their 
transactions and require the sec to assess the financial stability 
of the parent and affilated companies of brokerage houses 
the rest of the bill is very important said breeden it 
would improve our ability to improve stability in the market 
he added that another provision allowing the sec to halt all 
trading in market emergencies after consulting with the president 
was less important since the creation of mechanisms known as 
circuit breakers that automatically halt trading during times of 
extreme turbulence 
the development of circuit breakers has obviated most of the 
importance of that section said breeden who originally opposed 
giving the sec authority on its own to halt trading 
i was concerned that completely unfettered discretionary 
authority said breeden could prove to be destabilizing 
he said having such power could lead to rumors that it was about 
to be invoked causing uncertainty in the markets 
but the new legislative language adding presidential 
consultation approved by the subcommittee tuesday creates a 
twokey system like those used to guard against accidental 
missile launches 
you cant launch a missile without the two keys and this is 
still a twokey system and thats what i wanted to see in place 
said breeden adding that he believed that would lessen 
destabilizing rumors in times of extreme volatility 
on another matter breeden conceded that it was unusual for him 
to comment before a congressional panel this week about an ongoing 
sec investigation into possible fraud concerning the failure of the 
lincoln savings amp loan association and its parent american 
continental corp 
we generally dont like to comment on whether we have an 
investigation going said breeden but he said the probe was 
previously disclosed in sec filings by the subject of the 
investigation 
given the level of congresional and public interest in this 
matter and given the fact the investigations existence had been 
disclosed by the subject of the investigation i didnt think that 
there was any undue harm to confirm the fact said breeden

the nations stock exchanges dont have to be 
earthquakeproof or even fireproof but the securities and 
exchange commission wants them to figure out what they would do if 
one hit 
the fivemember commission voted unanimously wednesday to 
approve a policy statement calling on selfregulatory organizations 
in the securities industry to review their computer systems 
periodically 
the sec wants the industry to assess their systems capacity to 
handle heavy volumes of trades and their vulnerability to natural 
catastrophes and human tampering 
it is our belief that by providing guidance in this area we 
can continue and encourage efforts in the selfregulatory 
organizations to increase the efficiency of our systems and reduce 
the risk that the systems themselves will be unable to operate in 
times of stress richard g ketchum director of the secs 
division of market regulation told the commissioners 
the new policy which is purely voluntary also will request 
that exchanges and the national association of securities dealers 
which oversees the overthecounter market of stocks that are not 
traded on exchanges conduct stress tests of their automated 
systems to see how they would stand up to extremes in trading 
volume 
another aim of the policy is to get exchanges to establish 
contingency plans and develop backup facilities in the event of a 
system failure 
the new policy is a response to the october 1987 market crash 
when the trading volume on the new york stock exchange hit 12 
billion shares over two days 
that record surge caused backups in some automated systems 
leading to delays in executing trades and transmitting transaction 
reports 
automated systems were taxed again by last months 190point 
drop in the dow jones industrial average 
wall street cant work without computers said commissioner 
joseph a grundfest 
the new policy also calls for the selfregulatory organizations 
to assess the vulnerability of automated systems to threat such as 
fires earthquakes and vandalism 
options traders at san franciscos pacific stock exchange had to 
be flown to other cities to resume trading after last months 
earthquake 
just last week a fire in lower manhattan in the building 
housing the new york stock and american stock exchanges computers 
forced an hourlong delay in the opening of the two trading floors 
the sec policy statement also requests exchanges to notify the 
commission promptly of any instances of unauthorized access to 
their computer systems 
kathryn v natale an assistant director of the secs market 
regulation division said there have been no instances to date 
of unauthorized access but she said there is a greater threat as 
we internationalize the markets

new us barriers to foreign investment would 
betray the trust of eastern europeans who are now opening a vast 
new market to the west former attorney general elliot l 
richardson told congress 
he noted that lech walesa the polish labor leader has been 
urging us investment in poland 
america has historically been the champion of both economic 
and political liberalization richardson told a house banking 
subcommittee wednesday 
mr walesas appearance in washington is surely a sign that 
america continues to be seen as a champion the erection of 
protectionist barriers would be a signal to eastern europe that we 
are not putting our money where our mouth is richardson said 
it would be a betrayal of our principles and their trust he 
said 
richardson heads the association for international investment a 
private group that promotes greater flows of capital across 
borders he opposed any change in current us policy 
his views were challenged by two witnesses who warned against 
foreign political penetration of the united states through 
investment 
political action commitees pacs of foreign affiliates here 
contributed more than 2 million during the 1988 election 
cycles said pat choate vice president of policy analysis for 
trw inc a major consulting firm 
the raw political power of foreign owners to shape us trade 
policies is a troubling new development in the american political 
scene that is unexplored choate said 
susan j tolchin professor of public administration at george 
washington university suggested stronger enforcement of laws that 
prohibit foreigners from taking part in us elections 
the foreign automakers pac intervened successfullky in the 
1988 congressional election claiming victory in the defeat of 
several members whose policies they felt were inimical to their 
interests she said 
both complained of what they said is inadequate data on foreign 
investment in the united states 
among the many consequences of this information gap is that 
the defense department does not know who controls the critical 
industries that produce the key technologies used in americas most 
advanced weapons systems choate said 
richardson said foreign acquisition is an emotional issue 
serious people felt a tug at their hearts when they heard of 
the sale of rockefeller center he said 
but i would ask them to consider the feelings of britons and 
the response of the british government to fords buyout of jaguar 
he said 
the british government far from preventing the deal actually 
removed a legal obstacle to it i respect their wisdom and hope 
that we can emulate their courage richardson said 
the witnesses testified before the subcommittee on economic 
stabilization of the house banking committee rep mary rose oakar 
dohio who chairs the subcommittee said this was the first of a 
series of hearings that will continue into next year to review

in a 150 million deal that would 
represent the largest postwar business investment in hungary by a 
western company general electric co has agreed to buy controlling 
interest in tungsram a budapestbased lightbulb maker 
the deal announced wednesday is made possible by the recent 
liberalization of economic and political systems in eastern europe 
hungary has been in the forefront of this trend throwing out 
restrictions on foreign ownership and signaling it is eager for 
investment from the west 
this is both an excellent global move for ge and a historic 
moment in the reform of hungarys economic system said john t 
welch chairman of fairfieldbased general electric this joint 
venture was made possible by the hungarian governments policy of 
encouraging foreign investment and looking to world markets 
tungsram is one of hungarys largest industrial companies with 
12 manufacturing plants annual sales amount to about 300 million 
and 85 percent of its products are marketed abroad 
under the terms of a joint venture agreement negotiated with the 
hungarian credit bank ges clevelandbased general electric 
lighting unit will purchase just over 50 percent of tungsram and 
will assume management of the venture 
the majority of these shares are owned by the austrian 
girocentrale bank ge said 
in addition general electric has the option to purchase up to 
20 percent more of the shares on condition it accepts the 
obligation of doubling the partnerships west european sales within 
a fiveyear period 
andras gabor president of tungsram said hungary was on its way 
to becoming a democracy and developing a free enterprise system 
and that there was no going back 
ges participation in tungsram gives us the opportunity both 
to grow our lighting business and to embrace this process of 
change gabor said according to a ge statement 
the two partners plan to combine their european lighting 
distribution organizations into one unit to market both general 
electric and tungsram products ge said 
the joint venture will manufacture and sell products ranging 
from household lamps and energysaving fluorescent products and 
hightechnology discharge lamps 
in addition it will manufacture a full range of vehicle lamps 
and a number of special lamps ranging from miniature halogen lamps 
to infrared quartz lamps ge lighting said it will assist tungsram 
in expanding its product lines 
ge also will invest technological resources in the joint 
venture modernize tungsrams plant and equipment and introduce 
western management techniques 
ge will provide training for tungsram management and workers 
both in hungary and the united states 
the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this 
year ge said following negotiation of definitive agreements and 
government reviews 
the combination of tungsrams extensive product line and 
manufacturing base with ges advanced technology and manufacturing 
expertise will give us a better competitive position in the 
worldwide lighting market said john d opie a senior vice 
president of ge lighting

commerce committee which handles communications issues said 
wednesday the legislation was to place some check on what is now 
an unregulated monopoly 
the bills sponsors seven democrats and seven republicans said 
the legislation was to address complaints about rising cable 
television rates in the wake of deregulation and a lack of local 
government control over services provided to the more than 50 
million cable tv subscribers nationwide 
the legislation is strongly opposed by the industry 
this bill offers a series of extreme solutions to problems 
that are either modest or nonexistent james p mooney 
president of the national cable television association said in a 
statement 
as introduced the bill would 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
empower cities and other local governments to regulate rates 
for basic cable tv service in areas where there is no competition 
from another cable provider 
make it easier for local governments to revoke a cable 
operators franchise or deny a renewal 
prohibit any individual cable operator from serving more than 
15 percent of the nations subscribers 
require cable companies to carry local tv station signals from 
their area known in the industry as a must carry rule and 
give local broadcasters some guarantees on their channel placement 
by the cable operator in general the bill would require cable 
systems to carry local stations on the same channel as their 
overtheair position or at the channel location they had on the 
cabletv system as of 1985 
a 1984 law largely deregulated the cable industry with rate 
deregulation taking effect in 1987

us product liability law should be revised 
and include the creation of a federal product liability statute 
that would result in lower insurance costs and help make us 
companies more competitive abroad the us commerce department 
says 
the existing product liability system is in no ones 
interest said wendell willkie ii general counsel for the 
commerce department it imposes unwarranted costs and creates 
uncertainty for american companies reducing their profitability 
and limiting their ability to compete effectively 
willkie in a speech at an insurance industry seminar wednesday 
in manhattan gave the first public statement of the bush 
administrations plans to seek an overhaul of product liability 
laws 
during the 1988 presidential campaign george bush said he would 
support federal limits on certain types of product liability 
lawsuits to cut business insurance costs 
bush has told the council on competitiveness a panel headed by 
vice president dan quayle to propose changes in product liability 
laws that eventually could be submitted to congress willkie said 
the council which includes officials of the commerce justice 
and treasury departments was expected to make its recommendations 
early next year 
the bush administration believes the time for federal product 
liability legislation has arrived willkie said in his speech 
willkie who is working on the proposed changes declined to 
discuss any details but he said the president has three main 
objectives in seeking a federal product liability statute 
the restoration of fault as the standard under which an 
individual can receive damages in a product liability case under 
many state laws a manufacturer can be held liable even if a 
consumers actions were the cause of an injury and the product was 
not defective 
the elimination of deep pocket liability in which a 
defendant with the most money can be forced to pay an entire award 
even though it was only partly responsible 
increased use of alternative means of settling claims such as 
arbitration and mediation to help lower the costs of product 
liability litigation 
under congress constitutional power to regulate interstate 
commerce a federal product liability law would take precedence 
over conflicting state laws 
many state laws would remain in effect but a law passed by 
congress would establish federal principles that would be 
incorporated into the current state laws willkie said in a 
telephone interview after his speech 
the states still would have jurisdiction over product liability 
cases but would be bound by federal law he said 
in his speech willkie said the rising costs of insurance 
coverage and litigation in product liability cases have eroded 
manufacturers profits the higher costs have also driven up the 
cost of the goods american consumers buy making foreign products 
more attractive 
some us companies also have decided against expanding or 
creating new products out of fear they might one day face product 
liability claims he said citing a decision by monsanto corp not 
to develop a substitute for asbestos because of potential suits 
it feared the possibility of substantial future liability 
should the product be blamed for harm that cannot currently be 
identified willkie said 
meanwhile product liability insurance costs are 15 times 
higher in the us than in japan and product liability insurances 
rates were reported in the early 1980s as averaging 20 times higher 
in the us than in europe he said 
product liability insurance costs account for up 15 percent of 
the cost of certain americanmade machine tools willkie said 
such statistics demonstrate that in general foreign product 
liability laws impose a far smaller relative cost burden on 
businesses than american product liability law willkie said 
his speech came at a seminar sponsored by johnson amp higgins a 
large privatelyheld insurance brokerage

the federal government loans or insures 
20000 for every man woman and child in the country a total of 
5 trillion congressional auditors say in reporting a 10fold 
expansion of such programs in the past 13 years 
while the government will undoubtedly not be required to 
provide financial assistance for its total exposure associated with 
these programs its continuing and growing exposure to losses 
cannot be ignored the general accounting office says 
nonetheless the congressional watchdog agency said in a report 
prepared for a hearing today before a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee it is apparent that federal financial assistance 
beyond that already provided will be needed to pay for growing 
losses 
future taxpayers already have been tapped through a farm credit 
rescue and two savings and loan bailouts in the past three years to 
absorb tens of billions of dollars in federal loan and insurance 
losses 
additional billions of dollars in losses many of them not even 
discovered yet exist in other government credit and insurance 
programs the gao said 
not every program is in trouble said rep john dingell 
dmich who requested the study as the subcommittees chairman 
but some are in a serious enough state to be cause for concern 
dingell said the potential liabilities make the 14 billion to 
16 billion in fiscal 1990 budget cuts being sought by congress 
look like pocket change 
in effect every single american has cosigned a note for 
20000 he said 
from 1985 to 1988 losses on direct loans written off by the 
government increased 1700 percent from 12 billion to 212 
billion and delinquent loans rose by 33 percent from 146 
billion to 195 billion last year 
an even bigger potential for losses exists in the loan guarantee 
programs that deficitconscious congresses and presidents found 
attractive this decade for keeping the potential liabilities off 
the governments balance sheet the gao said 
many newer guarantee programs such as those for education and 
energy conservation involve loans with little or no marketable 
property as security the auditors said 
others such as those for small businesses that cannot otherwise 
get credit in the private market can quickly turn sour upon 
industry downturns and other changes in the economy they added 
as an example the gao cited the department of educations 
student loan guarantee program which has grown from 265 billion 
in 1983 to 476 billion last year reported defaults on student 
loans have almost tripled during the same time from 486 million 
in 1983 to 14 billion in 1988 
altogether a wide variety of loan guarantee programs have 
increased by 51 percent over the past five years to 550 billion 
annual defaults on those federally guaranteed loans have jumped by 
138 percent from 47 billion in 1983 to 112 billion last year 
the gao said 
the real situation could be even worse the agency said just 
two months ago gao auditors found 42 billion in federal housing 
administration loan defaults in 1988 five times what the agency 
reported 
the full magnitude of the governments losses under its credit 
assistance and insurance programs is not known the gao said 
because of longstanding deficiencies in financial managements 
and inconsistencies in the application of accounting principles by 
federal agencies losses are not always being recorded or reported 
when they occur 
in addition to the 550 billion in loan guarantees and another 
222 billion in outstanding direct loans the government also is 
liable for 36 trillion in insurance commitments most of it 
covering deposits in banks sampls and credit unions 
loans by governmentsponsored enterprises such as the federal 
national mortgage association or fannie mae and the federal home 
loan mortgage corp freddie mac total 656 billion up from 15 
billion in 1965

the g heileman brewing co has reached 
agreements with creditors that will give it until next june to 
rebound from a declining market share and sales the company said 
heileman was given a waiver on its loans from us and canadian 
banks company president murray cutbush said wednesday the 
agreements will allow the brewer to realize benefits from spending 
on capital improvements and marketing in 1989 he said 
in an interview published wednesday in the milwaukee journal 
cutbush responded to a report in australia that heileman may not be 
able to continue as a going concern 
an auditor for heilemans owner bond corp holdings ltd of 
australia said in bonds annual report that cash flow from 
heilemans operations was not projected to be enough to make 
principal payments on heilemans longterm debt in fiscal 1990 
these factors raise substantial doubt about heilemans 
ability to continue as a going concern the report said 
cutbush said that while the companys 1989 performance was less 
than satisfactory price increases and marketing and capital 
expenditures during the year were made for the long term not just 
for one year 
heileman could have spent nothing during 1989 and ended the year 
with a better record he said but that was not the view we 
took 
heileman spent money on capital improvements and new advertising 
and marketing efforts including the development of new 
commercials all of which ultimately will benefit the brewing 
operation said cutbush 
the expenditures were painful he said but done with the 
longterm future of heileman in mind 
in addition heileman closed three breweries including a large 
one in perry ga and those moves will reduce significantly the 
brewerys overhead cutbush said the other two breweries closed 
are in evansville ind and belleville ill 
we will realize those benefits in the following years he 
said 
since may heileman has been trading profitably in part because 
of price increases for its premium beers for the first time in 
years cutbush said 
we have seen a significant benefit from the large expenditure 
for marketing he said 
bond bought heileman in 1987 just weeks before the stock market 
crashed for about 13 billion and reportedly still owes about 
850 million after selling the profitable heileman baking co and 
other heileman subsidiaries 
analysts have said bond paid too much for heileman and cannot 
service the debt with heileman earnings 
the audit of bond corp which is controlled by australian 
financier alan bond was done in perth australia by terry 
underwood a partner in investment firm arthur andersen amp co 
the audit also cast doubt on the value of some of the australian 
concerns assets including real estate and media properties around 
the world 
last month bond reported losses of 7739 million in the fiscal 
year ending in june and the auditors report said those losses are 
continuing 
underwood said the bond groups liabilities exceeded assets by 
136 billion in australian dollars

merrill lynch amp co is banning all business 
related to south africa including trading or researching south 
african securities according to a published report today 
the move by the countrys biggest brokerage goes further than 
similar policies of other securities firms and could encourage 
others to take a tougher stance to protest south africas practices 
of racial separation the wall street journal reported 
the story appeared on a day when the south african government 
announced the repeal of a major segregation law called the 
separate amenities act 
president fw de klerk said the government will open all 
whitesonly beaches to blacks and repeal the law allowing local 
authorities to segregate public facilities 
merrill lynchs move announced in an internal memorandum to 
employees reflects growing public outcry that wall street firms 
continue to maintain ties to south africa the journal said 
other financial firms such as shearson lehman hutton inc 
already dont do business with south africa its corporations and 
individuals 
the sweeping new policies reportedly mean merrill lynch will no 
longer do securities research on south african companies and wont 
offer investment recommendations on their stocks 
also merrill lynch will no longer handle the buying or selling 
of south african shares for customers this extends to american 
depositary receipts for south african stocks plus warrants and 
other instruments an adr is a vehicle for us investors to trade 
in foreign securities 
researchers at merrill lynch will keep track of certain south 
african industries such as gold mining but wont comment on 
individual companies the newspaper said 
a spokesman for merrill lynch did not immediately return a 
telephone call seeking comment on the report

britains seasonally adjusted unemployment rate 
fell below 6 percent for the first time since october 1980 the 
government announced thursday 
it stood at 1674 million or 59 percent in october its 39th 
consecutive monthly decline and down 17 percentage points from a 
year ago employment secretary norman fowler said 
the opposition labor party which claims the government is 
massaging the figures by removing various categories from the 
definition of unemployed said the underlying trend gave cause for 
deep concern 
the partys employment spokesman tony blair said britain 
will now end the 1980s with over 16 million unemployed even on 
the governments statistics leaving many people facing the 
prospect of yet another christmas without a job and thousands more 
fearful of their job prospects at a time of high interest rates 
fowler said britain had the third lowest unemployment rate in 
the 12nation european economic community and added that the rate 
in britain had fallen faster than in other western industrialized 
nations 
but he warned that pay increases were averaging 91 percent 
well above the eec mean of 6 percent these kind of pay 
settlements can only make us less competitive and therefore harm 
future job prospects he said 
the highest regional level of joblessness was in northern 
ireland at 144 percent followed by northern england at 89 
percent according to the government figures the lowest level was 
32 percent in eastern england

three swissfranc traders at the chicago 
mercantile exchange have been indicted as part of a sweeping 
federal probe of corruption at the worlds two largest futures 
exchanges 
the indictments on charges of wire and mail fraud and 
violating commodity exchange laws were announced wednesday by us 
attorney anton valukas as part of a longrange investigation by 
federal authorities of the mercantile exchange and the chicago 
board of trade 
newly indicted were david zatz of chicago and danny scheck of 
skokie they are the first traders to be indicted in connection 
with the investigation since aug 2 when federal prosecutors 
announced charges against 45 traders and one clerk 
both are charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud 
and violating the commodity exchange act 
schecks lawyer harvey silets said his client would fight the 
accusations 
we believe he will be fully vindicated and that the charges 
will not result in any conviction because hes innocent silets 
said 
zatz attorney alan blumenthal said that although he had not 
yet examined the indictment we intend to go to trial 
also named in the indictment was robert mosky 33 of chicago 
who had been charged previously in the probe however wednesdays 
indictment supercedes the previous one 
the indictment increased to 80 from 63 the number of counts 
against mosky who is charged with racketeering conspiracy wire 
fraud and mail fraud and violations of the commodity exchange act

a move by moneylosing eastern airlines to woo more 
passengers by keeping cutrate fares to florida this winter has 
been matched by pan american world airways easterns closest 
competitor in its miami home market 
after eastern announced plans to continue its cheaper fares 
midway airlines also announced it will retain similar discount 
fares on some seats american airlines and delta air lines the top 
carrier out of fort lauderdalehollywood airport are studying the 
lower rates 
the existing fare structureis a fare structure that is 
doing nothing to stimulate travel into florida george brennan 
easterns vice president for marketing said wednesday our 
objective obviously is to make money 
we know a lot about florida and how to stimulate travel 
brennan said we have an awful lot of seats coming into florida 
this winter 
with relatively few restrictions the fares go into effect 
immediately for travel between nine florida cities and 45 other 
us cities 
while the airline industry normally boosts winter season fares 
to vacation points such as florida brennan said most of those 
flying to the sunshine state are discretionary or leisure 
travelers and eastern must offer incentives 
it is used more as a marketing tool to attract attention 
said robert joedicke an airline analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton its calculated to create a loss but its calculated to 
regain critical mass or market share eastern must be 
particularly active to win people back 
a miamitonew york fare based on roundtrip purchase would be 
99 each way midweek compared with a current price of 139 
eastern in many cases is maintaining discount fares aimed at 
regaining market share lost since the airline was hit march 4 by a 
strike and entered chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days 
later 
passengers must make reservations before dec 15 and purchase 
their tickets if space is available seven days in advance 
tickets are fully refundable brennan said reservations can be 
made through 1990 and will be honored with sevenday advance 
purchase 
a twonight stay is required for the fares but the discounts 
are not limited to the weekend according to brennan normal fares 
apply during the blackout dates dec 2126 southbound into 
florida and jan 13 northbound out of florida 
a slightly higher fare structure is to become effective jan 6 
offering discounts still below industry norms but about 20 higher 
each way than the bargain fares 
miamibased eastern currently flies 335 flights in and out of 
nine florida cities miami fort lauderdale west palm beach 
tampa orlando daytona beach sarasota fort myers and melbourne 
the eastern announcement came after last weeks thirdquarter 
report showed losses of 1852 million with indications creditors 
have been told of the carriers cash shortfall 
eastern officials are trying to rebuild without the unions they 
have said the airline will emerge from bankruptcy in early 1990 at 
nearly 90 percent its prestrike size 
the airline has 775 daily flights it had nearly 1100 before 
the strike

commerce secretary robert mosbacher said today 
the expected quick easing of soviet emigration laws will open up 
the soviet union for mostfavorednation trade status with the 
united states 
and soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin calling the new 
legislation a breakthrough and the first of its kind in the 
history of his country anticipated a positive us response 
at a news conference at the soviet embassy dubinin said 
conversations with us officials had not produced any specific 
assurances that us barriers to soviet exports would be lowered 
but he said we are expecting positive steps from the 
american side 
the legislation on its way to final approval will vastly ease 
restrictions on permanent and temporary travel abroad by soviet 
citizens 
one major change provides a broad right to passports good for 
five years abroad another limits to five years the period for 
which soviet citizens can be denied visas after working on a 
securitysensitive job 
dubinin said the legislation will create legal guarantees for 
assuring the human right to leave any country or to return 
i think that were going to see them moving quickly to pass 
this emigration bill and then that will open it up for the 
mostfavorednation treatment which will lower tariffs 
mosbacher said on nbcs today show and it will make it 
easier for the soviets to sell to us 
asked when the soviets might get the more advantageous trade 
status mosbacher said i would guess it would be within the next 
one to three months 
vice president dan quayle meeting at the white house with 
konstantin katushev the soviet mnister for foreign economic 
relations said we certainly hope that therell be positive 
developments in liberalizing their emigration policies any 
positive steps taken in that direction will be very helpful in 
changing our position 
a draft law lifting most travel restrictions on soviets passed 
its first legislative hurdle monday in moscow the bill allows 
emigration for virtually anyone who has entry permission from 
another country and no outstanding alimony obligations criminal 
charges or recent knowledge of state secrets 
it was given preliminary approval by the supreme soviet 
legislature monday and formalizes many changes that have already 
been put into practice in soviet emigration and travel policy 
mosbacher said unfortunately for them the soviets do not 
have much that the united states wants to buy mentioning 
petroleum and vodka and caviar and not much else 
the soviets desperately need western currency hard 
currency he said they also realize in the long term the only 
way theyre going to get this is investments us and other 
compnaies over there what they want is us companies to come 
over make investments 
on oct 26 president bush extended mostfavorednation status 
to hungary making it the first country to be freed from a 1974 law 
denying us trade credits to most communist nations 
the action gives the recipient nation full access to us 
markets and the lowest possible tariff rates putting it on an 
equal footing with major us trading partners 
the law requires an annual report to congress from the president 
on the emigration policies of each nation covered under the 
restriction and an assessment of whether there has been progress 
toward unrestricted emigration

the aflcio was urged today to adopt a 
prochoice stance in the national debate over abortion an issue 
that has sharply divided labor leaders gathered to celebrate their 
unity 
the sponsors of six resolutions calling on the federation to 
take a prochoice position agreed to put the issue to further study 
in exchange for a debate on the subject today the final day of a 
gathering highlighted by speeches by polish solidarity leader lech 
walesa and president bush 
nine speakers including two men spoke in favor of adopting a 
prochoice stance before the issue was referred to the executive 
council for study no one spoke against the resolutions although 
prolife forces within the labor movement are expeated to lobby the 
council heavily for their position 
the labor movement must choose sides and lead as we always 
have susan cowell vice president of the international ladies 
garment workers union said in urging the federations executive 
council to study the issue quickly and endorse a prochoice stance 
we did not choose this issue she said the reagan court 
has forced us to take on this issue labor cannot stand on the 
sidelines 
the abortion issue has proved a divisive one for a number of 
reasons pitting traditional labor factions that long have 
advocated staying neutral against a vocal coalition of women labor 
activists demanding that the federation take a stand 
those women say going on the record against last years supreme 
court decision expanding states rights to limit abortions and 
bushs recent vetoes of legislation providing federal funding for 
some abortions would put labor in line with its traditional allies 
including the democratic party and help it recruit women 
others however argue that a prochoice stance would hurt 
labors standing among hispanics most of whom are catholic many 
religious organizations and in conservative states 
cowell said advocates of the prochoice resolutions would push 
for the federations executive council to decide the issue by its 
february meeting and suggest language that would allow it to take a 
prochoice stance while recognizing moral and religious concerns 
if prochoice resolutions did come up for a vote it is widely 
believed they would be defeated leaving labor in an awkward 
position at a time most of its political allies are helping 
mobilize prochoice forces 
thats certainly not a bastion of liberalism in there 
william lucy vice president of the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees said of the 800 delegates 
susan bianchisand president of the association of flight 
attendants and a newly elected member of the council is being 
pressed by sponsors of the prochoice resolutions to lobby the 
council 
in an interview wednesday she would say only that the issue 
deserves to be looked at seriously 
her union is on the record in favor of choice but bianchisand 
said she had not decided whether the federation should take a 
position 
bushs wednesday address to the delegates was criticized by 
labor leaders because he avoided discussing his numerous 
differences with labor he praised aflcio president lane kirkland 
and the role of the federation in helping solidarity and other 
union movements around the world 
through the labor movement democracy is finding its voice 
bush said 
but he steered clear of his differences with labor over issues 
ranging from child care to the eastern airlines strike except to 
say i know we have differences 
at the end of the speech some delegates began chanting sign 
the bill a reference to legislation that would create a special 
congressional panel to investigate the 8monthold eastern strike 
administration officials have said bush likely will veto the 
measure 
he very skillfully avoided dealing with several of the very 
difficult issues that affect american workers lucy said

when auto worker larsola melzig moved into 
the new saab car assembly plant last month he found himself deep 
in paperwork 
inspection instructions work manuals and attendance reports 
were things he never had to deal with before now he even is 
involved in hiring new staff for his production team 
not that he regrets the extra work 
its fun to have a job with responsibility said melzig 23 
who is a leader of a sixman team building saabs upscale passenger 
cars assembling cars is now a good job 
melzig is one of the workers in saabscania abs new malmo 
factory which takes innovative swedish manufacturing labor 
practices a step further in reducing mindnumbing drudgery and 
increasing worker responsibility for such areas as quality control 
and daytoday management 
you cant build a firstclass car with workers whom you 
consider to have secondclass jobs says henry selenius the 
plants general manager 
in laborstarved sweden industries must compete to attract and 
keep workers with an unemployment rate of just 15 percent 
laborers can pick and choose their workplace 
the assembly line is gone at saabs new 150 million plant 
replacing it is what the company calls parallel assembly or 
autonomous work teams of up to 10 people who assemble a larger part 
of the unit and do their own quality control 
each team equipped with a personal computer plans its daily 
work ration and orders the materials it needs it also draws up a 
rotation of jobs within the group and files reports comparing 
results with managements targets 
workers here theyre called carbuilders start their day 
with a companyprovided breakfast followed by a team planning 
session against a backdrop of tropical flowers and water ponds 
the saab factory is light and spacious with walls and equipment 
in matching colors and a cubistic net of shimmering pipes on the 
ceiling 
escalators have replaced stairways a chessboard is painted on 
the floor of the rest area and its not unusual to find workers 
playing with kingsized chess pieces during their lunch hour 
theres also a grocery store and the topfloor restaurant 
commands a view over the oresund sound between sweden and denmark 
a company doctor offers specialist treatment for back strain which 
is the scourge of many factories 
in another innovation the work team is responsible for 
computercontrolled quality tests before sending the car to its 
next assembly station 
our goal is that the carbuilders themselves should be able to 
correct any defects and in future use their experience to assist 
the engineers in changing the construction to eliminate 
entirely the source of the defect selenius said 
some of swedens largest companies began dismantling the 
standard assembly lines in the early 1970s freeing workers from 
the repetitive singletask work day 
when saab took down the line in 1972 at its gasoline engine 
plant production costs increased but the company claimed its 
employees did higher quality work selenius said 
other factories were slow to follow said stig marklund of the 
metal workers confederation but now the practice is becoming more 
common he said citing such companies as alfa laval ab and car 
maker volvo ab among the converted 
marklund said other european manufacturers facing a longterm 
decline in the size of their work force had expressed interest in 
the swedish concept 
under swedens welfare laws all workers get a minimum annual 
fiveweek holiday and overtime may be compensated in extra time 
off which many workers prefer to highly taxed cash payments 
mothers or fathers are guaranteed 15 months of parental leave 
after the arrival of a newborn paid sick leave can apply also for 
those who stay home to care for a sick child or aged parent unpaid 
studyleave of up to a year is available without risk of losing a 
job 
one result of the system is chronic absenteeism saabs rate has 
been as high as 25 percent but selenius said the first three 
months in malmo showed an 8 percent decrease in absenteeism 
saab also wants to revamp the salary system which is strictly 
controlled by union contracts to give greater flexibility and more 
reward for experience and merit monthly salaries are average for 
the sector starting at the equivalent of 1613 or about 937 
after tax

british steel plc europes largest publiclyowned 
steel maker said thursday its aftertax profit rose 31 percent in 
the latest sixmonth period due to strong profit margins and a 
lower than expected exceptional charge 
the company reported profit after tax and minority interests of 
332 million pounds or 5246 million in the six months ended 
sept 30 that compared with a net of 253 million pounds in the 
same period last year 
earnings per share rose to 166 pence the equivalent of 262 
cents from 126 pence a year earlier 
group sales rose to 255 billion pounds or 403 billion from 
233 billion pounds a year earlier 
british steel had an extraordinary loss of 45 million pounds 
stemming from future reorganization costs 
operating profit rose 35 percent to 388 million pounds or 613 
million from 287 million last year 
pretax profit rose to 423 million pounds or 668 million from 
270 million pounds during the same period last year 
british steel said the sixmonth period was distinguished by 
buoyant trading conditions and good plant performance but the 
company warned that high british inflation and weakening steel 
demand might affect operating profit in the second half of the year 
and said it would continue its costcutting efforts 
in the past two years demand for steel products particularly 
in britain has soared enabling british steel to post strong rises 
in profits 
but robert scholey chairman of british steel said overall 
steel demand is slightly fading after running well over the average 
trend 
in britain scholey said the company wasnt doing too badly 
but that demand will probably go down he said he hopes the 
companys prices can hold up and forecast that fullyear 
198990 pretax profits would surpass last years 
it is likely that the weaker market conditions in britain will 
carry over into next years trading profit although market 
conditions in mainland europe are expected to remain relatively 
strong he said

stock prices hovered in a narrow range today in 
an unenthusiastic response to news of a smallerthanexpected us 
trade deficit 
the business day began with a report from the commerce 
department that the nations trade deficit contracted to 794 
billion in september from 1010 billion the month before 
the margin by which imports exceeded exports was the smallest in 
nearly five years and well below most advance estimates 
the news helped the dollar post gains against leading foreign 
currencies but the response in the domestic bond market was less 
enthusiastic 
and stockmarket observers said the decline in imports that 
showed up in the trade data could be interpreted as evidence of 
weakening consumer spending at a time when many investors are 
worried about the outlook for corporate profits

merrill lynch amp co said thursday it is 
discontinuing all business related to racially segregated south 
africa including trading or researching south african securities 
the move by the countrys largest brokerage which broadens a 
policy in place since september 1987 was the latest move by a wall 
street firm to protest south africas apartheid policies 
the new policy is significantly more comprehensive than 
required by federal law and meets the criteria of antiapartheid 
initiatives that have been adopted or are under consideration by 
various state and local governments in the united states merrill 
lynch spokesman fred yager said 
under the sweeping new policy merill lynch and its subsidiaries 
will no longer engage in any financial or commercial transactions 
with the south african government any of its agencies or any 
corporation or individuals organized or residing in the country 
the company will not conduct securities research on south 
african companies or offer investment recommendations on their 
stocks effective immediately researchers will continue to respond 
to questions from the companys sales force on developments and 
trends in south africa until jan 31 
also merrill lynch will not buy or sell south african shares 
for customers this extends to american depositary receipts for 
south african stocks plus options warrants and other instruments 
an adr is a vehicle for us investors to trade in foreign 
securities 
researchers at merrill lynch will continue to keep track of the 
south african gold and precious metals industry as part of a global 
overview but the company said it wont offer opinions on 
individual south african mining companies 
because of the importance of south africa in terms of global 
gold production it is necessary to be aware of production trends 
in that market in order to be able to fully assess the outlook for 
gold yager said 
the revised policy was outlined in an internal corporate 
memorandum to employees the company has periodically reviewed its 
policy since implementing restrictions on its dealings with south 
africa in 1987 
other investment firms such as shearson lehman hutton inc 
already refuse to do business with south africa numerous other 
firms have curtailed their south african connections to comply with 
legal requirements 
the news of merrill lynchs toughened policy came on a day when 
the south african government announced the repeal of a major 
segregation law called the separate amenities act 
president fw de klerk said the government will open all 
whitesonly beaches to blacks and repeal the law allowing local 
authorities to segregate public facilities 
accounts maintained for customers residing in south africa will 
be closed as of jan 31 
previously merrill lynch had various prohibitions on south 
african dealings some implemented to comply with laws 
the company had not conducted business in the country owned or 
run any operations there or bough or sold south african gold coins 
or other commodities also merrill lynch did not engage in any 
transaction that would have involved paying taxes or duties to the 
south african government the company said

the dollar rallied thursday on news of a big 
improvement in the countrys trade balance but finished below its 
best levels due to technically motivated selling 
gold prices edged up in us trading after posting sharp gains 
overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery ended at 39140 a troy ounce up 10 cents from 
wednesdays settlement the republic national bank of new york 
quoted an ounce of gold at 39130 as of 4 pm est 40 cents

the dollar got off to a strong start in us foreign exchange 
trading it gained support from a report that the nations 
merchandise trade deficit tumbled to 79 billion in september the 
smallest monthly deficit in nearly five years 
but the deficits unexpectedly sharp decline caught some 
currency investors unprepared and forced them to adjust their 
holdings by selling dollars the market had anticipated a deficit 
of about 89 billion 
rumors that the federal reserve board was selling dollars to 
mute the rally accentuated the downtrend that had been touched off 
by the technicallyoriented sales the fed never comments on any 
daytoday currency transactions some dealers said they doubted 
the central bank had actually intervened 
mixed emotions about what the commerce departments trade report 
meant also snuffed out some of the enthusiasm to buy dollars one 
interpretation was that the slowdown in imports underscored the 
weakness in us economic growth which would strengthen the case 
for lower interest rates 
a decline in us interest rates would tend to lessen demand for 
dollars and make returns on dollardenominated investments less 
attractive

a surge in demand for home heating oil 
the december contract for heating oil soared 166 cents to 5879 
cents a gallon in new york mercantile exchange trading as colder 
weather was predicted for many parts of the country subsequent 
contract months also posted strong gains 
heating oil prices are sensitive to changes in the weather on

international futures inc said a rally in european markets set 
the stage for thursdays domestic gains 
speculation that heating oil would be in short supply in the 
soviet union sent prices higher overseas and the momentum carried

grain and soybean futures prices rose thursday on the chicago 
board of trade amid hopes that the warming of ussoviet relations 
would lead to greater grain sales to the russians 
but analysts were skeptical saying the soviets already seem 
able to buy as much grain as they want 
on other commodity markets thursday coffee prices fell sharply 
heating oil surged leading the energy complex higher precious 
metals were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
in chicago wheat futures settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 407 a bushel corn 
was cent to 2 cents higher with december at 240 a bushel oats 
were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with december at 147 a bushel 
soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with november at 584 a 
bushel 
most of the buying stemmed from comments made thursday by 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher who said the expected easing 
of soviet emigration laws would open up the soviet union for 
mostfavoredtrade status with the united states 
mostfavored nations have full access to us markets at the 
lowest possible tariff rates 
the soviet unions restrictive emigration policies have 
prohibited it from being considered for mostfavorednation trading 
status but the united states has allowed the soviets to buy 
millions of tons of us grain and even subsidized soviet purchases 
of wheat 
the soviets already buy large amounts of grain around the 
world and they probably already buy at their maximum level said 
walter spilka a grainmarket analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york 
he said the effective ceiling on soviet grain purchases is set 
by their own limited port capacity not by restrictions on how much 
they can buy 
analyst william biedermann agreed that lowering trade 
restrictions would not likely increase soviet purchases of us 
grain immediately but it might in the long term if it means the 
soviets can buy grain more cheaply 
coffee futures fell sharply on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange amid nervousness about thursdays voting in the brazilian 
presidential election brazil is the worlds largest coffee 
producer 
news of significant rainfall in brazilian coffeegrowing regions 
also prompted selling of futures 
coffee settled 24 cents to 412 cents lower with december at 
7289 cents a pound 
heatingoil futures surged on on the new york mercantile 
exchange as frigid temperatures moved into the midwest and headed 
for the northeast 
analysts said crudeoil futures also got a boost from 
speculative buying ahead of an opec meeting that begins this 
weekend in vienna 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 24 cents 
higher with december at 1986 a barrel heating oil was 95 cent 
to 166 cents higher with december at 5879 cents a gallon

gold settled 10 cents lower across the board with december at 
39270 a troy ounce silver was 54 cents to 61 cents higher with 
december at 5595 a troy ounce 
cattle futures slipped on the chicago mercantile exchange 
reflecting ideas that wednesdays gains were overdone pork futures 
were mixed amid disappointment over the governments rejection of 
initial offers from dealers for pork bellies that the government 
plans to buy and send to poland 
cattle futures settled 25 cent to 48 cent lower with december

a job recruitment quiz distributed by a pepsi 
cola employee was denounced thursday by pepsi officials who called 
it insulting for its digs at atlanta the hometown of the soft 
drink makers chief rival cocacola 
the quiz poked fun at the eating habits leisure activities and 
sophistication of atlanta home of the cocacola co comparing the 
city unfavorably with new york pepsi cola co is based in 
purchase ny a suburb of new york city 
the handout distributed recently to business students during a 
pepsi employment recruiting trip to northwestern university in 
chicago asked the students to match statements with the correct 
city 
for example it asked which city offers any food in the 
world and which one has fat backs and grits for recreation 
it asked which had yachting or cow tipping on culture the 
choices were metropolitan museum of art or the stone mountain 
civil war museum 
word of the handout surfaced in atlanta when the atlanta 
journalconstitution published a story about the quiz on thursday 
cocacolas relatively restrained response stated were proud 
to call atlanta home what is cow tipping anyway 
cow tipping refers to a prank in which people attempt to knock 
over a sleeping cow the reference to fat backs apparently 
meant fatback an ingredient in some southern dishes 
gerald bartels president of atlantas chamber of commerce was 
a little more offended i always thought of new yorkers as 
sophisticates and erudites im surprised they would display their 
naivete and ignorance so publicly he said 
spokesman tod mackenzie at company headquarters said pepsi 
officials still were trying to determine the origin of the quiz 
but they were sure it was the work of a pepsi employee 
the quiz was a terrible prank and done in extremely poor 
taste mackenzie said it was insulting we dont condone it 
and it is not part of our recruitment strategy 
mackenzie said pepsi has about 8800 employees in the atlanta 
area 
ron tidmore president of dallasbased pepsi south the parent 
companys southern operation said he received a few calls thursday 
from consumers who had heard of the quiz and were upset and 
concerned 
we tried to explain the whole thing was done in poor taste 
tidmore said 
i was upset when i heard about it myself said tidmore a 
native of columbiana ala and a graduate of the university of 
georgia whoever did it obviously has never spent any time in the 
south 
he said the person responsible would be dealt with but he 
would not say if the person would be fired it was just bad 
judgement it probably was a very junior level person who did 
something they thought was cute and didnt understand the 
ramifications tidmore said 
tidmore said the company did not plan to run advertisements 
apologizing for the incident because that would only attract more 
attention to it

eastern airlines reported quick and heavy response 
thursday to its cutrate winter air fares to florida and two 
competitors matched the rebuilding carriers new fares 
pan american world airways a major competitor in florida and 
second to eastern in miami service immediately matched easterns 
fares as did midway airlines officials at two other key 
competitors in florida delta air lines and american airlines said 
they were still considering responses 
eastern losing some 2 million a day as it struggles to 
overcome an 8monthold strike and emerge from chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization on wednesday moved to build up its 
passenger base by offering fares as low as 79 one way in florida 
during the peak winter travel season 
our agents are experiencing very very heavy call volume 
eastern spokesman robin matell said it started last night and is 
continuing today 
in a separate development thursday texas air corp announced 
that easterns sister carrier continental airlines has agreed to 
buy 40 foreignmade airbus jets in a deal valued at about 45 
billion 
the move is the latest example of parent company texas air 
building up continental to the detriment of moneylosing eastern 
pilots union spokesman skip orr charged 
matell said eastern officials knew they could be triggering a 
winter fare war 
lets face it anytime you file a fare that offers a 
competitive advantage you always run the risk of the other carriers 
matching matell said 
some independent analysts say such lowball fare promotions do 
little to help airlines improve a crucial passenger base business 
travelers who arent as responsive to lower fares as discretionary 
fliers who fly infrequently 
but matell said eastern is trying to get any and all passengers 
our approach on something like this is to stimulate traffic 
and to generate passengers who might otherwise not have traveled 
given the existing fare structure matell said were in the 
process of rebuilding our market share because of the strike and 
the longterm effects its had 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon in new york said the carrier 
felt compelled to match eastern 
we certainly want to remain competitive in that market she 
said adding that although pan am didnt welcome a fare war the 
decision was easily made well match all of them 
with relatively few restrictions easterns fares went into 
effect immediately for travel between nine florida cities and 45 
other us cities 
a miamitonew york fare based on roundtrip purchase would be 
99 each way midweek compared with a current price of 139 
passengers must make reservations before dec 15 and purchase 
their tickets if space is available seven days in advance 
tickets are fully refundable and reservations can be made through 
1990 
a twonight stay is required for the fares but the discounts 
are not limited to the weekend normal fares apply during the 
blackout dates dec 2126 southbound into florida and jan 13 
northbound out of florida 
a slightly higher fare structure is to become effective jan 6 
offering discounts still below industry norms but about 20 higher 
each way than the bargain fares

the investment group trying to acquire bat 
industries plc in what would be britains biggest takeover said 
thursday it may include a cash component in a revised version of 
its highly leveraged offer 
hoylake investments ltd said it was considering offering cash 
in place of some of the debt instruments in the original 133 
billionpound 21 billion offer but would keep the value of the 
offer at 850 pence or 1340 a share 
bat industries said it was advising shareholders to take no 
action because the proposals do not constitute an offer and 
are not binding 
hoylake is the investment vehicle set up by financiers james 
goldsmith jacob rothschild and kerry packer to bid for the bat 
group 
the original bid had technically lapsed while awaiting us 
regulatory approval meanwhile bat shareholders have voted to sell 
off some of its holdings to bring in about 4 billion and fortify 
the conglomerate against hoylake 
in a statement hoylake indicated it might offer cash instead of 
the 20 percent of the bid package made up of hoylake loan stock 
the balance would consist of hoylake senior debt as originally 
planned or cash or a mixture of cash and debt 
hoylakes statement made as the preamble to the release of a 
revised filing with us insurance regulators said the cash would 
be raised partly by selling hoylake equity to anglo group plc a 
holding company controlled by goldsmith and rothschild 
the original terms have been snubbed by many european investors 
and analysts as too debtdependent 
the goldsmith group initially said its offer was worth 850 pence 
a share though the valuation was later raised to 878 pence 
no arrangements have been made for underwriting or placement of 
the debt securities hoylake said because it is not free to make a 
fresh offer for bat until it has won all the us regulatory 
clearances related to its plans to sell farmers group bats us 
insurance unit 
once it wins the approval it can bid anew within 21 days 
hoylake said a new offer would be subject to largely the same 
conditions as the original offer and would be conditional on the 
previously announced agreement for the sale of farmers to frances 
axa midi assurances for 45 billion 
hoylake said the consideration it would offer bat shareholders 
for their shares could be reduced depending on how much the value 
of bats equity is changed by its restructuring 
in a statement issued late thursday in new york farmers said 
we believe that the information released by goldsmith does little 
to enlighten anyone the socalled details he provides are still 
based purely on speculation and conjecture with no indication that 
financing will be available for what continues to be a debtladen 
hypothetical scheme 
under the deal farmers would be exposed to the financial 
condition of goldsmiths takeover vehicle the statement said

chickens are slaughtered in conditions so 
filthy that bugs crawl on the walls the floors are slick with 
blood and guts and when carcasses fall in the muck they are 
picked up and tossed back on the line a former poultry worker told 
a congressional panel thursday 
as a result consumers get chicken that we wouldnt feed to 
our dogs donna bazemore said in testimony submitted to the house 
education and labor subcommittee on labormanagement relations 
the subcommittee is considering legislation to standardize the 
treatment and protection of whistleblowers 
bazemore a former worker at a perdue industries poultry plant 
in north carolina was in a car accident wednesday and could not 
appear before the subcommittee said tom devine a lawyer with the 
government accountability project who represents her 
but her testimony described conditions straight out of upton 
sinclairs the jungle a 1906 expose of the chicago meatpacking 
industry 
to start with the plants are filthy bazemore said in her 
testimony the floors regularly are covered with grease fat snd 
and roaches bugs are up and down the sides of the walls 
chickens regularly fall off the line and into all the muck on the 
floor the supervisors have workers put them back on the line 
bazemore said workers are instructed every day to remove tags 
from hundreds of chickens condemned for diseases such as tumors and 
green growths on their intestines chicken parts are sometimes 
removed from a filthy floor drain and thrown back on the line she 
said 
at perdue she said workers were told that if they spoke to 
reporters or the usda they would be fired bazemore is now an 
organizer with the center for womens economic alternatives a 
support group for workers in the poultry industry 
perdue farms with headquarters in salisbury md responded by 
issuing a press release calling bazemore less than a model 
employee 
the only way to respond to such outrageous allegations is to 
invite members of congress and the media to directly contact 
government officials at the us department of agriculture and 
the occupational safety and health administration and ask them if 
they would allow any poultry plant to function under the conditions 
ms bazemore described thomas r moyers perdues vice president 
of human resources said in a statement 
after devine finished reading from bazemores testimony rep 
marge roukema rnj expressed disbelief asking where inspectors 
from the agriculture department and the state are 
devine said they are present but cannot oversee the entire plant 
all the time 
what ms bazemore has described are gross violations that 
would be visually apparent to anyone at the plant roukema said 
suggesting that bazemore should be called back before the 
subcommittee and placed under oath 
if these allegations are true we have much more than just a 
whistleblower problem she said adding that this matter would be 
referred to the appropriate congressional committee as well as to 
the agriculture department 
robert p davis the labor departments solicitor told the 
panel his agency opposes the whistleblower legislation adding that 
other such laws already exist 
we are concerned that a generic approach to whistleblower 
protection although it is an attractive goal could result in some 
unnecessary or inappropriate federal coverage davis said 
legislation could be enacted to eliminate gaps in the existing 
laws he said but such gaps should be identified and explicitly 
covered by any new legislation
