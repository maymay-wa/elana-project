saudi arabia and china participants in a 
secret arms deal two years ago have agreed to open trade offices in 
each others capitals 
a chinese embassy statement issued friday said the two countries 
ambassadors to the united states saudi arabian prince bandar bin 
sultan and chinese envoy han xu signed a memorandum of 
understanding in washington to set up commercial representative 
offices 
the decision was reached with a view to further developing the 
friendly relations and cooperation between china and saudi arabia in 
the economic and commercial field embassy spokesman wu zurong 
said 
it was disclosed earlier this year that saudi arabia secretly 
purchased mediumrange missiles from china in 1986 the state 
department told congress last may that while saudi arabia refused to 
allow us inspection of the chinese missiles it assured the united 
states that the launchers would not be equipped with nuclear or 
chemical warheads and it backed this by signing the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
the opening of trade offices is often regarded in diplomacy as a 
symbol of thawing relations and a prelude to formal diplomatic 
relations between countries that do not recognize each other such 
as saudi arabia and the peoples republic of china 
saudi arabia is one of the larges countries in the world that has 
continued to recognize the rival chinese nationalist government in 
taiwan the policy was explained in the past as one of support for 
offshore taiwans staunch anticommunism and opposition to the 
official atheism of mainland china 
but in recent months taiwan newspapers have noted that the saudis 
and some other countries were drawing closer to beijing and they 
have speculated that those countries might switch their diplomatic 
recognition for its part taiwan has been relaxing restrictions 
against its citizens private contacts with the chinese mainland and 
expanding trade and other contacts with communist countries of the 
soviet bloc 
as of last january mainland china had formal relations with 135 
countries and taiwan only 23 the united states switched official 
recognition from taiwan to beijing in 1978 and maintains a broad 
range of relations with taiwan at a nonofficial level

president daniel ortega asked the 
national assembly to extend a 30day state of emergency imposed just 
before hurricane joan ravaged nicaragua state radio reported 
meanwhile nicaraguas only opposition newspaper on friday 
claimed the government botched the chance to get substantive 
hurricane assistance by demanding rather than asking aid in a 
crude manner 
the newspaper la prensa charged the sandinistas committed a 
great diplomatic error that cut off the aid by asking for too 
much assistance and in a bad way from managuas diplomatic corps 
the newspaper also said some of the sandinistas requests 
appeared targeted for the nicaraguan army rather than victims of 
hurricane joan 
joan killed 116 people left more than 200000 homeless and 
caused severe damage to much of the country in its rampage across 
nicaragua 
citing a document it said was provided by a diplomatic source 
the newspaper said government requests for field tents and certain 
types of medical supplies generated suspicions the request was a 
maneuver to supply the sandinista army with medical resources 
it said the government requested 440000 analgesic tablets more 
than 1 million serum flasks bandages plaster for casts small 
surgical tools and other supplies more appropriate for field 
hospitals 
la prensa further charged that tents donated by britain were not 
given to the homeless 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters last month 
that the united states feared any emergency aid it offered would 
help the sandinistas fight ussupported rebels known as contras 
the leftist government had no immediate comment on la prensas 
report 
radio sandino on friday reported ortega asked the national 
assembly to extend the 30day state of emergency imposed oct 20 
two days before hurricane joan struck 
ortegas request was expected to be approved in the assembly 
where the ruling sandinista national liberation front holds 61 of 96 
seats 
the emergency law suspended several articles of the constitution 
dealing with freedom of expression

the second time around in the peace corps 
is easier say catherine and william derrenger who met and married 
during a stint in sierra leone in the 1960s and have just returned 
from two years in the fiji islands 
we had always planned on doing it again and when our children 
went off to university we just decided to do it said mrs 
derrenger 47 the couple has a son who graduated from the 
university of chicago and a daughter who is a senior at western new 
england college in springfield 
no figures were available on peace corps volunteer 
reenlistments but corps spokesman james flanigan said from 
washington that its happening more and more many of those who 
volunteer a second time first joined right out of college and then 
decided to return after retiring from their careers 
its a trend thats just begining to manifest itself as the 
peace corps enters its third decade but we have a number of people 
in both categories he said 
the first time we were a lot younger derrenger said this 
time we were no less enthusiastic but we were a lot better equipped 
to really provide useful skills to the people 
it was more difficult the second time for the derrengers to break 
away from their everyday lives he owned an eightstore shopping 
center in billings mont and she ran a preschool there at the 
time of their first peace corps tour they were newly graduated from 
college but for the second goround neither found it hard to cast 
off their possessions 
it was like taking the ultimate shower you felt so clean 
afterwards derrenger said i had been walking around with two 
pockets full of keys and when we were through getting rid of the 
stores the house the vehicles and everything we had two keys 
left to the footlockers that held everything we owned 
said mrs derrenger its kind of fun to be starting over 
again just like our kids 
when we decided to go we got rid of everything down to the 
things that we were going to pass on to the children after we died 
it took us two years to do it but its a marvelous wonderful 
feeling to sell everything 
in 1963 mrs derrenger a chicopee native headed to sierra 
leone to teach in a girls school in segwema her future husband 
who grew up in south dakota and graduated from baylor university in 
texas arrived in west africa a few months later to work on a 
program to build roads and a water supply in the isolated region 
the derrengers currently are staying with relatives in chicopee 
near springfield and havent made any definite plans 
it wasnt love at first sight he said recalling how she 
with more experience got the front seat in the truck carrying them 
from the airfield leaving him to breath dust and grumble for 200 
miles 
it was easier this time because we were a team and had some 
life experience behind us said mrs derrenger the first time i 
taught school the second time i trained teachers 
her work in fiji included developing a program to train 150 
preschool teachers and establish 90 schools his involved adapting a 
program teaching management skills to chiefs and other tribal 
leaders 
it was something i thought about during the 25 years we were 
back in the states he said the chief system is one that works 
and makes sense it just needed the application of modern management 
techniques

more than 400 palestinian leaders 
gathered today for a meeting of the palestine parliamentinexile in 
a session expected to result in the declaration of an independent 
west bank and gaza strip 
a leading plo official said the declaration would be an important 
step toward establishing a palestinian homeland in the 
israelioccupied territories the israeli government claiming the 
move will only cause more violence tightened security in the 
territories 
from the international legal point of view this independence 
declaration will consecrate officially the identity of the west 
bank and gaza said bassam abu sharif chief spokesman for plo 
leader yasser arafat 
abu sharif said the next step after declaration is recognition of 
the palestinian state from other nations 
abu sharif met with reporters at the heavily guarded seaside 
center where the palestine national council the 
parliamentinexile begins a fourday meeting today 
abu sharif claimed the israelis plan to assassinate top palestine 
liberation organization leaders he said a list of intended victims 
included arafat and that one assassination had been recently 
attempted he did not elaborate 
in jerusalem avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak 
shamir responded the imagination of bassam abu sharif has 
apparently been working overtime in anticipation of the pnc 
palestine national council and he will say anything to get a 
headline 
israeli officials claim an independence declaration will hurt the 
middle east peace process and incite more antiisraeli violence in 
the territories 
the declaration is irrelevant said a shamir aide yossi ben 
aharon but to our sorrow it will incite the population 
underground palestinian leaders called on supporters to step up 
protests during the meeting israel on friday closed access to the 
west bank and imposed a curfew on the gaza strip 
the meeting of the 450member council is seen as a historic

during a discussion over control of the cox enterprises inc 
washington bureau 
the publisher in todays combined editions of the newspapers 
said kovach had wanted greater influence over the cox washington

a presidential stock market that required 
participants to put their money where their mouth is accurately 
predicted the outcome of the presidential election the markets 
originators say 
the computerized market was established by four researchers at 
the university of iowa who wanted to see if it could outperform 
opinion polls in it professors and students gambled cash to buy 
shares of the candidates 
after the election share owners were paid a dividend that 
depended on the fraction of the popular vote received by each 
candidate a trader could make money by accurately predicting the 
outcome and then bidding to buy shares at prices below his forecast 
or to sell at prices above it 
in theory its more accurate than polls because of the 
financial incentive people have to put their money where their mouth 
is said one of the researchers robert forsythe an economist 
prices of the candidates shares could be converted easily into 
numbers showing what percentage of the public favored each 
candidate forsythe said 
since shortly after the second presidential debate oct 13 the 
stock market showed republican george bush with between 512 percent 
and 536 percent of the vote leading democrat michael dukakis by a 
margin ranging from 52 percent to 8 percent 
bush won tuesdays election with 54 percent of the vote and by an 
8point margin 
starting oct 17 the market has been predicting about this 
outcome all along said forsythe if you look at the polls over 
that period theyve been a heck of a lot more volatile 
gallup polls for example gave bush a 6 percent advantage early 
in october a 10 percent advantage near the end of october and a 9 
percent advantage just before the election said coleen mcmurray of 
the gallup organization in princeton nj 
forsythes collaborators in the project were economists forrest 
nelson and george neumann and political scientist jack wright 
the researchers closed the market wednesday and are beginning to 
analyze it nelson said they would like to continue their research 
with a similar market next fall that will allow students at several 
big 10 universities to buy and sell stock in the big 10 football 
teams 
nelson said the stock traders profits and losses had not been 
tallied by friday but one trader claimed to have earned a 30 
percent profit and another said he had lost 40 of 150 wagered 
most of the 168 traders profits and losses were probably less than 
a few dollars nelson said 
the market differs from polls in that it does not reflect the 
traders preferences but rather their impressions of how well each 
candidate is doing 
each stock trader is in effect a private pollster surveying 
friends and following news reports 
the market prices respond to the information traders pick up 
economic theory predicts that because the traders arent being asked 
their preferences they dont have to be a representative sample of 
the population to accurately reflect public opinion 
the researchers are far from proving that the market is an 
effective means of surveying public opinion but they were 
encouraged when the market did not show the wild swings in public 
opinion that were registered in polls 
jack ludwig chief methodologist of the gallup organization said 
an educated group like the iowa stock traders would be less likely 
to show the kind of swings in popularity that the candidates do on a 
general population basis 
ludwig also said he didnt believe that the small sample of 
white educated midwesterners could be used to estimate public 
opinion nationwide 
a potential advantage of the market over opinion polls is that it 
provides a continuous record of public opinion forsythe said 
john eighmey a senior vice president and market survey expert at 
the young and rubicam advertising agency in new york said he had 
seen the market demonstrated and found it really quite intriguing 
and impressive 
its one thing to ask a person what do you think about this 
subject its quite another when they have a personal stake in the 
answer he said

police fought young demonstrators with 
batons tear gas and water cannon as tens of thousands of people 
rallied across poland on the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of the 
polish state 
earlier friday communist authorities held their most elaborate 
ceremonies to celebrate the reestablishment of poland in 1918 when 
antisoviet leader jozef pilsudski took power at the end of world 
war i 
opposition groups organized independent marches and rallies in 
the cities of warsaw gdansk krakow wroclaw lublin lodz poznan 
tarnow and katowice 
but the official news agency pap complained that protests in 
several cities caused a dissonance in the patriotic atmosphere 
in some cities there were demonstrations and attempts to 
disturb public order undertaken by irresponsible groups of youth 
it said 
reporters watched police fire tear gas and then charge about 500 
young people near the tomb of the unknown soldier in warsaw after 
demonstrators threw sticks at officers the protesters quickly 
scattered into a nearby park but at least 10 were detained 
the skirmish followed a torchlight march by more than 20000 
poles chanting solidarity and independence in the streets of 
the capital following a mass marking the anniversary 
an opposition spokeswoman in gdansk said 25000 people attended a 
mass in st marys basilica catholic church the countrys largest 
church afterward many tried to march but were attacked by police in 
full riot gear who fired water cannon and beat demonstrators with 
batons 
referring to plans to shut down the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
birthplace of the banned solidarity union spokeswoman joanna 
wojciechowska said the crowd chanted defiantly lenin is yours 
the shipyard is ours 
the turmoil ended after bishop tadeusz goclowski appealed to the 
police commander to call off his troops and let the mainly youthful 
protesters disperse unattacked she said 
in western poznan city a twohour battle erupted between riot 
police and 4000 shouting leafletthrowing demonstrators said 
alexandra bessert a solidarity activist she said scores of people 
were detained 
three people were hospitalized after being beaten by police in 
the southern industrial city of katowice said maria moczulska a 
spokeswoman for the confederation for an independent poland police 
also intervened after a mass in tarnow opposition spokesmen said 
people gathered peacefuly in lodz wroclaw lublin and other 
smaller cities opposition spokesmen said 
but after the main rally attended by 10000 people in krakow 
small groups of youth reportedly clashed with police after they 
decided to march on the soviet consulate 
the warsaw crowd packed st johns cathedral in the old town 
where warsaw bishop wladyslaw miziolek told worshipers the 
independence of poland is the concern of every generation 
after a mass led by boy scouts the crowd marched down a historic 
street past the restored royal castle to lay flowers at the tomb of 
the unknown soldier 
the popular demonstrations followed a day of gala celebrations 
sponsored by polish officials including a rare televised mass and 
legions of goosestepping soldiers in a military parade 
it was the first time so much attention was paid to pilsudski 
who in 1918 had just been released from a german prison at the end 
of world war i 
on nov 11 1918 a civil council in warsaw turned over military 
power to pilsudski who proclaimed an independent polish state and 
disarmed german troops in the capital 
the dream of generations of patriots was realized with the 
reestablishment of poland after 123 years of being partitioned 
between prussia austria and russia nov 11 was celebrated as 
independence day before world war ii but was spurned by communist 
authorities after the war 
official attitudes toward the date have softened in the aftermath 
of the 1981 declaration of martial law with the military government 
embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name of 
the ojczyzna the fatherland 
on victory square polish communist party leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski wearing his army uniform and flanked by prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski presided at the hourlong official ceremonies

penthouse magazine publisher bob 
guccione may buy a 12 million boardwalk tract where a casino hotel 
was once proposed a state appeals court has ruled 
the decision thursday was the latest ruling in nine years of 
protracted litigation over the site where the mayflower hotel once 
stood 
guccione became embroiled in a lawsuit with greta and joseph 
shamy who were under contract to buy the hotel in 1977 according 
to court papers 
the shamys of galloway township and guccione had agreed to form 
a corporation to buy the property and develop a new casino hotel 
but the shamys sued for breach of contract in 1979 following a 
business dispute 
seven years later after numerous court hearings a superior 
court judge ordered the property placed in receivership and sold to 
a competitive bidder 
gucciones attorney henry n luter of morristown said guccione 
and an investment group put together by the shamys made separate 
offers 
the courtappointed receiver arthur m greenbaum recommended 
that the property be sold to guccione for 12 million the amount he 
had already invested in the property according to court papers the 
shamys appealed that recommendation 
but in a decision released thursday judges herman d michels and 
john d keefe of the appellate division of superior court affirmed 
the receivers recommendation

the dollar spiralled downward depressing stock 
prices for the biggest daily loss on wall street since april and 
reflecting concerns about how presidentelect george bush will 
manage the economy 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
lost 4766 points friday to finish at 206703 that gave the 
bluechip indicator a net loss of 7877 points for the week the 
steepest electionweek decline since the 1948 victory of president 
harry s truman 
the dollar stood at a 10month low against the japanese yen and 
at fivemonth lows against the west german mark and british pound 
dealers noted that efforts friday by the central banks of several 
nations to halt the dollars slide failed 
it was not enough said gary taratunio a trader at 
manufacturers hanover trust co 
central banks typically try to halt a drop in the dollars value 
by buying large amounts of dollars on their domestic exhanges 
the whole market is waiting to test the resolve of the central 
banks and given that unless there is strong intervention or policy 
statements by the new bush cabinet the dollar will continue to 
slide taratunio added 
the dollars decline heightened the concerns of investors who 
spent the week worrying about interest rates and the nations 
budget and trade deficits 
the biggest concern is whether bush will be able to work with 
congress to resolve the serious problems said alfred e goldman 
vice president of ag edwards amp sons inc a brokerage firm 
most analysts predicted the stock markets bearish sentiment 
would persist in the near term as investors try to sort out the 
prospects for the future 
the market started the week on a down note as nervous investors 
anticipated the outcome of the presidential election the market 
gained slightly on election day then slid the remainder of the week 
in mostly light trading 
analysts said that in the postelection environment investors 
felt little conviction to commit their funds in the face of mounting 
questions about how bush will deal with the nations twin deficits 
and whether the federal reserve will raise interest rates to prop up 
the sagging dollar 
with the government bond market closed for the veterans day 
holiday and little other activity to give wall street impetus stock 
prices tracked the eroding dollar 
statements made in europe by george gould a us treasury 
official and us commerce secretary william verity indicated there 
is support for the dollar at its current depressed levels a lower 
dollar means us products are cheaper abroad 
gould said in london that while the stock market has to seek its 
own level we as a matter of policy have no interest in seeing 
the dollar lower 
john lipsky director of international bond research at salomon 
brothers said we are near the point where unless there is some 
policy action the market will decide that a new lower level of the 
dollar will not be resisted there is little doubt that we are going 
to have a clear test of united states policy intentions regarding 
the dollar 
on friday declining stocks outnumbered advancers by about 41 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
1235 issues down 292 up and 414 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 13550 million shares up

the furor over a kristallnacht speech 
made by the parliament president who resigned under intense 
criticism reveals west germans lingering sensitivity to the nazi 
past 
the address by bundestag president philipp jenninger prompted 
charges that some germans have not honestly faced up to what 
occurred under adolf hitlers nazi regime including the 
extermination of 6 million jews 
the background of what happened is the inability of many 
germans to stand up to their own past the leftist greens party 
said before jenniger a conservative christian democrat resigned 
friday 
in his speech thursday marking the 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht when nazi thugs attacked jews jenninger attempted to 
set the scene of germany in the 1930s when hitler came to power 
saying germans initially found the nazi era glorious 
jenninger says the speech was misunderstood and that he is an 
uncompromising foe of every type of totalitarian rule 
both west germany and communist east germany devoted themselves 
this week to decrying kristallnacht or crystal night of nov 910 
1938 the prelude to the holocaust the night was named for the 
shards of glass that littered streets after nazis smashed and burned 
jewish business homes and synagogues 
west german president richard von weizsaecker has insisted 
germans bore full responsiblity for the nazi era and warned against 
any attempts to play down its horrors 
nothing that historical science brings to light today can 
diminish the crimes of the nazi era weizsaecker said last month 
the east german government has also denounced the nazi years but 
rejects responsibility for nazi crimes they say because the crimes 
occurred before the 1949 founding of the communist country west 
germany was founded the same year 
for all their wellintentioned effort the remembrances of 
kristallnacht this week went awry with jenningers speech 
jenninger recalled that many germans in the 1930s at first felt 
hitler brought them glorious times 
his address ignited a storm of protest at home and abroad 
politicians across the political spectrum called for jenninger to 
resign 
angry responses came from israel and from jewish leaders in the 
united states 
east germanys official news agency adn called the jenninger 
speech a scandal 
newspapers reported chancellor helmut kohl a close friend of 
jenninger called him to the office to criticize him for the 
emotionless tone of the speech 
the leftist greens said jenningers speech showed that despite 
the passage of 43 years many west germans still have not 
sufficiently come to grips with what happened under hitlers rule 
hansjochen vogel head of the opposition social democrats said 
this event shows us how the darkest chapter of german history is 
still a presentday thing 
in new york morris abram chairman of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations said speaker 
jenninger regardless of his intentions was guilty of insensitivity 
to that which can never be forgotten or forgiven 
but many observers rushed to his side pointing to jenningers 
record as a steadfast supporter of israel also no one questioned 
his assertions that he is antinazi 
the conservative daily newspaper die welt in todays editions 
said jenningers main error was the tone of his speech could have 
given the impression he had found a way to understand the 
developments of 50 years ago without balancing that against 
harsher criticism of the nazi era 
the controversy is likely to keep west germans thinking about how 
best to deal with recollections of the nazi years the newspaper 
said 
the reasons for the fast plummet of the secondranking official 
in our country will be occupying us for a long time die welt said 
a leader of west germanys jewish community thursday defended 
jenningers speech 
i welcome that the parliament president described in full 
clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 said 
michael fuerst a deputy chairman of the central council of jews in 
west germany 
especially the fact that everything that hitler did was 
strongly supported by the masses of all germans fuerst said 
but friday jewish council chairman heinz galinski was quoted as 
disavowing his deputys comments 
no one is supporting him thats shown by the numerous protests 
that have reached me from all jewish communities the neue presse 
of hanover quoted galinski as saying 
the newspaper also quoted galinski as saying fuerst might lose 
his job

crashed killing all three crewmen while preparing to land aboard a 
warship in the north arabian sea

approach to the frigate uss barbey 
they were coming in toward the ship they called in and said 
they had some kind of a problem and then the helo helicopter just 
went down and hit the water said one official 
the aircraft apparently sank immediately because boats and other 
helicopters from the barbey the aircraft carrier uss nimitz and the 
missile cruiser uss california were unable to find any survivors or 
wreckage the official said

notificationof next of kin

operating in the arabian sea in support of us forces inside the 
gulf

air pacific at san diego where the barbey and the helicopter 
squadron are based 
in addition to the three presumed dead in fridays crash the 
overall crash toll includes two us marine pilots killed when their 
ah1 cobra helicopter gunship was lost apparently due to hostile

videotapes of a man accused of 
killing his daughter show him assuming the voices of satan his 
dead grandmother and some other of the 10 personalities that a 
psychiatrist says he diagnosed 
a jury that began watching the videotapes friday saw a hypnotized 
thomas lee bonney tremble with grief and pound his fist on a table 
as he insisted that his daughter kathy carol bonney 19 was not 
dead 
bonney is charged with shooting his daughter 27 times 
in one videotape bonney said his daughter visits him in jail 
most nights shell come in here to see me after everybody 
else goes to sleep and well talk a weeping bonney said 
watching the videotape friday bonney frowned and looked puzzled 
at what he saw outside the courthouse he said the man in the 
videotapes was not him 
everybodys got a twin in the world the chesapeake va man 
said i guess ive got one too 
bonney 45 who is being held in a jail is charged with 
firstdegree murder in his daughters death her nude body was found 
last november next to the dismal swamp canal just inside north 
carolinas border with virginia 
satan and three other of bonneys 10 purported personalities 
revealed themselves in 23 hours of videotaped interviews with dr 
paul f dell a psychiatry professor at norfolks eastern virginia 
medical school 
dells testimony is key to bonneys defense that he is innocent 
by reason of insanity if convicted he could be sentenced to death 
superior court judge paul m wright viewed portions of the tapes 
thursday and ruled they could be shown to the jury 
dell in his testimony said bonneys memory problems and 
inconsistent stories are the result of multiple personalities in 
the video the jury saw friday bonney could not remember his height 
his age or the name or phone number of his old businesses 
it is the switching and struggles among his alternate 
personalities that is producing his strange and inconsistent 
behavior dell said 
on one tape bonneys voice took on a demonic snarl as he was 
interviewed 
youre just a mortal bonney growled eyebrows arched long 
fingernails clicking on a tabletop you dont know nothing 
during other interviews bonney assumed the feeble voice of 
mammy his longdead maternal grandmother and called out for kathy 
bonney 
can you hear me kathy bonney said in his grandmothers 
voice im so old so old but i gotta fix supper maybe youll 
change your mind eat some supper now 
she aint supposed to be living in here the satan voice 
interrupted referring to bonneys dead daughter she wont be in 
here long she called me a bastard 
the gun went off she was sitting there screaming and i 
was hollerin and i said what are you gonna do and she said 
im gonna shoot you you bastard 
i know everything the satan voice continued i am strong 
i can do what i want to when i want to i control tom hes dumb 
a wimp a goodygoody talking that jesus garbage all the 
time 
suddenly viking spoke up a noble friendly personality and 
the first to reveal itself during bonneys evaluation by dell 
hes gonna shoot her viking screamed excitedly apparently 
reliving the night ms bonney died hes gonna shoot her no no 
ive got to protect her dont shoot her i love her 
ms bonney had argued with her father on a darkened roadside 
about a love letter to a married boyfriend whom satan called 
that stupid newt then according to the satan personality ms 
bonney called satan a bastard she sorta goofed when she called 
him that 
she thought she was talking to tom satan said but she was

the spotty record of matthew barnwell 55 which was never enough 
to cause his removal from the principals post at ps 53 in the 
south bronx prompted school board president robert wagner jr to 
rip the principals union 
the unions pushing this guy back is a tremendous disservice to 
kids wagner said this case reflects why the system of 
principal tenure to a school is very bad 
the union the council of supervisors and administrators 
represents 4600 principals and other administrators 
barnwell pleaded innocent friday to a misdemeanor charge of 
criminal possession of a controlled substance crack cocaine during 
arraignment in criminal court he was released on his own 
recognizance 
barnwell the first new york city principal ever arrested on drug 
charges was scheduled to return to court nov 22 
barnwell who will receive his 62199 salary pending the end of 
his case was arrested a week after schools chancellor richard green 
announced a drug crackdown in schools 
his arrest wednesday for allegedly buying two vials of crack on a 
harlem street corner sparked a review of the process that kept him 
on the job for 16 years despite bad reviews and complaints 
michael sofarelli inspector general for the board of education 
confirmed that his office received a tip earlier this year that 
barnwell was having problems with drugs and alcohol 
the reports said the veteran principal had nodded off in meetings 
and behaved erratically sofarelli said but the tip which came in 
an anonymous letter was never substantiated school officials said 
curtis johnson president of the local school board that controls 
ps 53 told a thursday night meeting of parents from the school 
that barnwell had undergone alcoholism counseling and a report 
published friday in the new york post said he also had requested 
drug treatment 
barnwells problems caused his temporary removal from the school 
three times in the past seven years said board member jerome green 
in addition the principal twice received unsatisfactory ratings due 
to absences and lateness school officials said 
only one principal has been fired in the school system in the 
last nine years 
james stein director of the board of educations office of 
appeals and reviews said that to get fired youd have to be an 
ax murderer 
but union president ted elsberg who stressed this was an 
isolated incident pointed out that there were never formal charges 
brought against barnwell despite all the complaints

an armed forces commander 
rejected a call by leftist rebels to observe a truce during an 
organization of american states meeting next week saying it was 
nothing but a public relations ploy 
they the guerrillas should not play with an entire peoples 
desire for pacification col mauricio vargas commander of the 
3rd army brigade in the eastern province of san miguel said friday 
it the announcement is cynical and it is not ethical peace 
is not a momentary truce it should not be manipulated on the 
international stage to give the impression that a certain will 
exists where it does not in fact exist said vargas one of the 
armed forces top colonels 
defense minister gen eugenio vides casanova and col rene ponce 
head of the joint chiefs of staff were not immediately available 
for comment on the rebel proposal 
the oas general assembly meeting in the salvadoran capital is to 
run monday through saturday secretary of state george shultz is 
scheduled to attend 
guerrilla leaders told a mexico city news conference friday their 
truce would run from 6 pm sunday to 6 pm friday they called on 
the army to observe the ceasefire 
we have decided to suspend the military campaign and declare a 
fiveday truce during the meeting said joaquin villalobos a 
leader of the farabundo marti national liberation front the 
umbrella organization of leftist salvadoran rebel groups 
villalobos said the rebels would respond if the army attacked 
vargas said he would not suspend military operations in the 
eastern zone 
we have not entertained the idea of interrupting the 
fulfillment of our constitutional duty which is to combat those who 
are killing the people he said 
we soldiers cannot speak about a truce because we are not the 
aggressors we are the object of aggression he added 
another rebel leader leonel gonzalez proposed talks with the 
salvadoran government before presidential elections are held in 
march and said the rebels would set no preconditions 
the last meeting between government and rebel representatives was 
in october 1987 in san salvador the guerrillas have rejected the 
governments demands that they first lay down their arms 
the insurgents began fighting the usbacked government eight 
years ago and more than 65000 people have been killed most of them 
civilians 
in a related development the armed forces reported troops killed 
19 guerrillas in three clashes thursday it gave few details and did

just in time for the holidays most major us airlines are 
eliminating discount fares used primarily by business travelers and 
others who make their trips on short notice airline officials said 
effective tuesday the airlines are dropping discounts on tickets 
purchased three to seven days in advance that means travelers will 
have to buy their tickets at least 14 days in advance and meet other 
restrictions to obtain the lowest fare to some destinations 
continental airlines took the first step nov 4 by eliminating 
oneway discount fares which require advance purchase other big 
carriers including american northwest and united quickly followed 
suit 
we are in the middle of a fare restructuring program said 
ned walker a spokesman for houstonbased continental you will 
see some fares decrease and others increase 
walker said friday night that the eliminated continental fares 
generally required sevenday advance purchase and carried a 
cancellation penalty these fares accounted for less than 5 percent 
of continentals ticket sales he said 
in chicago united airlines said it was following continentals 
move 
this is proof that the economy is strong and the carrier will 
set the rates united spokesman chuck novak said friday 
the airline still has a variety of discounts available to 
generate traffic novak said these junk fares do not produce 
new revenue they erode the revenue yield 
northwest airlines also is eliminating its oneway discount 
supercoach fares which require a three seven or 14day 
advance purchase depending on the market said spokesman bob 
gibbons 
northwest followed continentals lead because we have a higher 
cost structure and if we can still offer a competitive fare but at a 
slightly higher rate thats better for us because it can help 
recoup our higher costs gibbons said 
delta air lines spokesman bill berry contacted friday night 
would neither confirm nor deny whether the atlantabased airline 
planned to join the discount elimination 
the industry announced a couple of weeks ago that they would be 
ending some discount fares and this might very well be one of them 
but im not certain berry said but we are not a leader in 
this 
american airlines based in fort worth texas announced 
wednesday that it was shedding its socalled junk fares beginning 
nov 15 an american spokesman said the action was in response to 
continentals move 
americans cheapest fares have relatively short advancepurchase 
requirements and dont require the traveler to stay at the 
destination over a saturday night the fares usually are 10 percent 
to 35 percent below full coach fare 
last month american quietly tried to eliminate the junk 
fares from a number of its routes originating in dallas most of the 
affected routes were to cities that lowfare braniff airways 
formerly served from dallas 
american twice pulled back after delta its chief dallas rival 
refused to match the move most recently american delayed the plan 
on oct 25 
american spokesman jim brown said the moves by american and 
continental would be more widely felt than under americans original 
proposal because continental dropped its junk fares in virtually 
all its markets and american matched the moves in most of those 
markets 
walker said continental will continue its popular maxsaver 
fare which usually requires an overnight stay and may carry a 
cancellation penalty walker said that depending on the market the 
fare requires a seven to 14day advance purchase

the us navy said today it is investigating the 
firing of 10 sandfilled practice shells by an american destroyer 
near a japanese coast guard vessel at the entrance to tokyo bay 
the foreign ministry protested to the us embassy over the 
incident wednesday which caused no injuries or damages 
the area is not specifically designated for gunnery tests and 
because of this the navy is investigating the test said kent 
hansen a spokesman for us naval forces in japan 
the nonexplosive projectiles struck the water about 300 yards 
from the uraga a coast guard vessel sparking the protests 
the coast guard said it was a violation of international law for 
such firing to take place in japans waters 
the visiting commander of us forces in the pacific adm 
huntington hardesty apologized for the incident friday as he made 
courtesy calls on prime minister noboru takeshita foreign minister 
sosuke uno and other japanese officials 
japanese newspapers called on the government to press the united 
states on the firing and linked it to complaints about similar 
incidents on okinawa the southern japanese island where 30000 us 
troops are based 
speaking of targets the liberalleaning asahi shimbun said 
in an editorial today okinawans often say that american 
servicemen treat them as though they were targets 
the asahi quoted the governor of okinawa prefecture junji 
nishime as blaming a recent series of accidents there on 
something wanting in the us militarys chain of command or a 
decline of discipline 
on okinawa rifle bullets hit a civilian housing area near a 
firing range in october and after two us marine helicopters 
collided in flight early this month killing four marines japanese 
officials expressed concern over what would have happened if the 
collision had occurred over an okinawa town 
probing the causes of the accidents is now an urgent task 
the asahi editorial said in a nutshell the stationing of us 
troops in a manner that puts residents on needles and pins can be of 
no advantage to either the united states or japan 
this weeks incident took place off the boso peninsula which 
guards the entrance to tokyo bay an area busy with maritime 
traffic the navy guidedmissile destroyer uss towers was returning 
to its base at yokosuka which is just inside the bays entrance 
when it held a brief gunnery test on a gun that had undergone 
maintenance the navy spokesman said 
although the test was very limited in nature and posed no 
danger to shipping it alarmed other vessels in the general area 
hansen said 
the navy is looking thoroughly into the matter and sincerely 
regrets it occurred he said 
hansen said the towers fired 10 sandfilled shells aiming them 
at the sea japanese press reports quoted transport minister 
shintaro ishihara as saying the shells had apparently been aimed at 
the japanese coast guard vessel

towns in the sinhalese heartland face 
serious food shortages because of a strike by fuel workers a 
government official said today 
sufficient food supplies have been sent to the southern port of 
galle but gasoline shortages have prevented distribution to other 
towns in the region food commissioner graham dissanayake said 
about 2500 employees of the ceylon petroleum corp the island 
nations only gasoline supplier walked off the job monday in 
response to a fourday strike called by the extremist sinhalese 
peoples liberation front 
many workers still were not back on duty today 
on friday jayewardene issued an emergency decree providing for 
death by hanging for people convicted of instigating strikes or 
refusing to report for work in essential services sectors such 
as fuel and transportation 
senior officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
decree is a deterrent and the government hopes it will not be 
necessary to resort to capital punishment to stop strikes 
the decree was the second tough measure introduced this week to 
try and halt antigovernment protests 
on wednesday the army was given orders to shoot on sight anyone 
demonstrating against the government the day after soldiers opened 
fire on thousands of antigovernment demonstrators in three southern 
towns at least 18 people were killed 
in colombo soldiers continued to deliver fuel to gasoline 
stations where motorists waited in line for hours 
at tea plantations in the hills of central sri lanka planters 
predicted temporary shutdowns unless gasoline arrived within days 
tea is a mainstay of sri lankas economy earning more than 
onequarter of the countrys foreign exchange 
a twoday aroundtheclock curfew expired without being renewed 
in the sinhalese heartland today when jayewardene appealed to 
people to refrain from supporting antigovernment extremists 
the sinhalese president warned that if the violence did not stop 
nearly 50000 workers would lose their jobs in the tourist industry 
this weeks strikes were the latest in a series called by the 
peoples liberation front which the government blames for 
assassinations of 550 government officials and supporters the last 
15 months 
the front is capitalizing on a sinhalese backlash against 
jayewardenes peace overtures to tamil insurrectionists and has 
vowed it will not be satisfied until the president resigns 
presidential elections are scheduled dec 19 jayewardene is 
barred by law from seeking a third term 
the president signed a peace accord with india last year designed 
to end the tamil separatist war that started in 1983 and has claimed 
8500 lives the accord offered a measure of autonomy to northern 
and eastern sri lanka where most tamils live if the rebels 
surrender their weapons 
militant tamils say they need a separate homeland to preserve 
their language culture and hindu faith and to combat job and 
education discrimination by the majority sinhalese community

stealth fighter and other planes has scheduled a symposium on the 
issue a pentagon official said 
gary d vest the air forces deputy assistant secretary for 
health and safety said in a speech and in an internal memo that 
evaluation of the advanced materials was warranted according to 
published reports 
vest said the materials are widely used in the aerospace industry 
although there is little knowledge about their possible health risks 
composite materials including carbon plastics and other 
synthetics are increasingly replacing metals in aircraft 
construction to save weight increase strength and defeat radar 
detection 
workers at a lockheed corp plant in burbank calif have gone 
to court with claims that the composites have caused health problems 
ranging from headaches to cancer results of a health inspection of 
the plant last month have not been made public 
workers at boeing co plants in the seattle area have made 
similar complaints 
we have not yet made the necessary commitment to really 
understanding the effects of chemicals building and manufacturing 
materials and the processes involved with them vest said in a 
speech to toxicology experts nov 2 in fairborn ohio home of 
wrightpatterson air force base 
the us senate environment and public works committee is 
preparing to investigate health complaints by aerospace workers and

composite hazards according to fridays issues of the seattle 
postintelligencer and the daily news of los angeles

made a number of inquiries and concluded that there are questions 
that warrant evaluation and analysis

health effects to discuss the aspects of the technology its

the office of the dalai lama spiritual 
and temporal leader of tibetans says chinese authorities arrested 
20 monks entrapped by a questionnaire asking if chinese officials 
should be removed from tibet 
we wish to express our deep concern at what appears to be a new 
form of intimidation which has been introduced in tibet said the 
letter friday to the chinese embassy in new delhi 
a chinese diplomat said today the letter had been forwarded to 
beijing but she could not say whether its allegations were true 
the letter issued by the dalai lamas office said the monks were 
arrested earlier this month after they had the courage to state 
their true feelings in the questionnaire 
the letter said chinese officials conducted the survey using the 
name of beijing university and the tibetan educational research 
center 
it said the last time such a questionnaire was used was 1959 
shortly before an abortive uprising against chinese rule that forced 
the dalai lama to flee to india in 1959 
china invaded tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later 
the letter said the questionnaires sent to lamas or monks 
sought detailed information about their families and views on 
political issues 
the list of 100 questions included ones that were clearly 
intended to be used as a tool for propaganda and intimidation the 
letter said the examples included 
do you hope that all the chinese officials be removed from 
tibet 
do you hope to have the dalai lama as the leader of the tibetan 
government 
the dalai lama says he is willing to talk with chinese officials 
about the future of his homeland 
it is very disturbing that this new measure should have been 
introduced in tibet at a time when his holiness the dalai lama is 
making every effort to promote a peaceful solution to the tragic 
issue of tibet the letter said 
last june he proposed the creation of a selfgoverning 
democratic entity in tibet that would let china retain troops on 
tibetan soil and conduct tibets foreign policy 
that was a major concession but a chinese statement called it an 
insufficient basis for talks because the dalai lama had not 
relinquished the concept of an independent tibet

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev is trying to 
break resistance to reform by centralizing political power through 
new laws and constitutional changes that are tantamount to a 
coup says dissident scientist and humanrights campaigner andrei 
d sakharov 
the new laws will set back the trend toward glasnost or greater 
openness in the soviet union sakharov said friday at a meeting with 
helsinki watch the organization founded 10 years ago to monitor 
human rights in sovietbloc countries 
a package of changes in the soviet constitution that was drawn up 
without public debate is an attempt by gorbachev to retain enough 
power to break the resistance to reforms by the apparatus 
sakharov said 
it looks like he was faced with the necessity to get all the 
power in his hands he said 
i believe he is doing it with good intentions the 
67yearold nobel peace prize winner continued nonetheless i 
consider it a dangerous development 
sakharov who also spoke friday to a packed reception at the new 
york academy of sciences has been an outspoken critic of gorbachev 
as well as his most distinguished supporter 
the change in our personal situation was part and parcel of 
general change in conditions in our country said the physicist 
who was in internal exile in the closed city of gorky with his wife 
yelena bonner until they were freed by gorbachev two years ago 
sakharov was banished in 1980 for opposing the soviet invasion of 
afghanistan 
its with great hope and a lot of excitement all of us are but 
unfortunately with a lot of fear as well watching the process 
unfold sakharov said through an interpreter 
he told the academy of sciences gathering that there is a saying 
going around among moscow intellectuals lets not pamper 
gorbachev 
i think that postulate and the meaning they inject into it is 
wrong sakharov said gorbachev should be helped but critically 
it refers obviously not just to gorbachev personally but to 
all of the processes taking place in our country as well he added 
one should not think that all the problems have been already 
solved on the contrary very many of them remain 
he said some of the changes taking place in the soviet union are 
dangerous and complicated 
many laws which are being adopted are a step backwards in 
reality sakharov said 
in response to a question about whether western banks should make 
unrestricted loans to the soviet union sakharov said the west 
should be afraid not of the success of perestroika but of its 
possible failure 
perestroika is the russian term for gorbachevs policy of 
restructuring 
the victory of reactionary forces would mean not merely a 
return to the era of stagnation but we wouldnt have money for 
social programs for glasnost however for the buildup of our 
military they would find the funds anyway 
sakharov who is making his first trip to the west arrived in 
the united states on sunday and spent several days with his wifes 
children outside boston 
on thursday he officially received the 1973 human rights award 
from the international league for human rights at a private 
manhattan reception 
he plans to travel to washington to visit president reagan in the 
white house on monday and attend a board meeting of the 
international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity a moscowbased group of which he is a director

west germany will donate 114 million for victims

a popeyed bug believed to be the worlds oldest 
insect discovered almost by accident in a chunk of mud suggests 
that insects may have originated millions of years earlier than once 
thought scientists say 
to the uninitiated the fossil looks like two small specks 
but to paleozoologist conrad labandeira and colleagues the bug 
found on the north shore of gaspe peninsula in quebec canada is 
the oldest known insect dating back some 390 million years 
the finding is reported in fridays issue of the journal science 
which describes remarkably wellpreserved fragments of a wingless 
bug belonging to the most primitive order of insects and similar to 
the modernday silverfish 
even more significant than the fossils age scientists say is 
its similarity to modern bugs which suggests that insects 
originated many millions of years before the specimen lived 
what we have is two fragments we have a head capsule 7 
millimeters wide and we have a thorax 1 millimeter long said 
labandeira a 38yearold graduate student at the university of 
chicago 
even though theyre separate were very convinced that they 
belong to the same individual he said friday 
the fossil was found by francis hueber a noted smithsonian 
institution paleobotanist who retrieved the specimen about five 
years ago while examining a mud sample he found on the gaspe 
peninsula 
its importance was only recently discovered when he and other 
scientists compared notes 
huebers interest was in prehistoric plant fragments in the dirt 
but what looked like ancient insect parts caught his eye 
he had an idea that there was something very important about 
the fragments labandeira said 
through sophisticated dating techniques hueber determined that 
it was an early arthropod and probably an insect said bret beall 
a scientist at chicagos field museum who has been working with the 
specimen 
he knew that if this was an insect fossil it would be very 
significant beall said 
hueber gave the specimen to beall who with labandeiras help 
determined that it was in fact a bug and what they believe is the 
worlds oldest known insect 
it lived 390 million to 392 million years ago and the scientists 
say it predates by about 15 million years what previously was 
believed to be the oldest insect represented by an eye fragment 
found in upstate new york 
the bugs most imposing features are two disproportionately large 
eyes on each side of its head it also had two antennae and two 
armlike appendages that appear to have been equipped with sensors to 
detect odors and vibrations 
the significance is that they have a head so its really a 
clincher that there were insects at that time said william shear 
a biology professor at hampdensydney college in virginia where the 
new york specimen is being studied 
the exciting thing to me is that these insects have changed 
very little as far as we know in almost 400 million years shear 
said that suggests that they were almost already modern in form 
400 million years ago that they had a long history before that 
he said 
the newly discovered fossil eventually will be sent to the 
smithsonian institution in washington for its permanent collections 
labandeira said

prime minister yitzhak shamir promised four 
religious political parties his likud bloc would change a law 
defining who is a jew if they join likud in a new government 
the leader of the rightwing likud bloc made the pledge friday 
despite vocal opposition by jewish leaders in the united states and 
other countries who object to amending the law and say that would 
divide the jewish people 
the controverisal law defines who is recognized as jewish by 
israel and it automatically confers citizenship on jews who emigrate 
to israel 
the proposed ammendment says immigrants converted to judaism by 
reform or conservatives rabbis would not be regarded as jews by 
israeli authorities and woud be ineligible for citizenship the 
ammendment would only honor conversions conducted by orthodox rabbis 
prime minister shamir told the religious parties he is sure he 
can pass the law within three months of the new government said 
shamir spokesman yossi achimeir its not ideal but the silent 
majority of jews abroad will accept it with understanding 
achimeir said 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member parliament in the nov 1 
elections more than the leftleaning labor partys 39 seats but 
not enough to form a majority 
although the rightwing party has the support of three farright 
parties which together carry seven seats it still needs the 
support of the religious blocs 18 seats to form a majority 
rabbi yitzhak peretz the leader of the ultraorthodox shas 
party said friday that likuds promise satisfied him and he favored 
joining the likud government it is possible to say we got a 
satisfying answer peretz said friday afternoon 
jews abroad the majority of whom are not orthodox have been 
vocal in their opposition to the amendment the amendment has 
tremendous symbolic meaning by implying the the nonorthodox streams 
of judaism are not legitimate 
however achimeir said the change in legislation would have 
little practical effect 
even without the change in the law the nonorthodox jews do 
not come to live in israel by the masses achimeir said the 
majority who come are the orthodox jews 
shamir also met friday with the national religious party and the 
ultraorthodox agudat israel and degel hatorah parties rabbi 
avraham ravitz of degel said he was pleased by shamirs pledge 
the national religious party already is supporting likud 
other religious parties are scheduled to meet with president 
chaim herzog next week to make recommendations for the prime 
ministers post herzog will then ask the party leader most likely 
to form a coalition to head the next government

it was a cockeyed carmen at the metropolitan 
opera the tenor who should have been on stage spent the night in 
the orchestra pit and the soprano who sang a supporting role far 
outshone the female lead 
but georges bizets masterpiece has survived far worse treatment 
than it received friday night in the seasons first performance of a 
production created 2 years ago by sir peter hall for his wife 
mezzosoprano maria ewing 
her performance as the fiery gypsy who refuses to give up her 
freedom received mixed reviews at the time and she is no longer 
appearing in the production 
in her place was argentinean mezzo alicia nafe making her met 
debut despite a pleasant voice she did not make much of an 
impression in the cavernous house lacking the power and vocal 
thrust to bring carmens many haunting melodies to life in the 
pivotal card scene of act 3 when carmen learns she is doomed the 
voices of fellow gypsies frasquita and mercedes all but drowned her 
out 
by contrast cheryl studer a soprano from michigan making her 
debut as micaela established herself immediately as a major artist 
she could throttle up the volume with ease without sounding harsh or 
strident and its no surprise that she has been performing major 
wagnerian roles in leading opera houses lets hope the met puts her 
to better use soon 
now to the tenors gary lakes a hulking texan who sang a 
firstrate siegmund in wagners die walkuere last year was a 
rough unidiomatic don jose at this point in his career he simply 
lacks the grace vocal or physical to carry off the role of the 
naive soldier who falls fatally in love with carmen 
and all the while a few feet away with a baton in his hand was 
one of the worlds foremost don joses placido domingo who is 
developing a second career as a conductor as insurance against the 
day when his tenor voice fades 
the problem is that at this point he is still a great tenor but 
not a great conductor he put the orchestra through its paces 
conscientiously but failed to bring out much of the passion or 
pessimism of this wondrous score 
the fourth major character the dashing toreador escamillo was 
sung by another debutant french baritone jeanphilippe lafont he 
proved a lively performer but like most baritones who attempt this 
role he couldnt do justice to the low notes of the famous 
toreador song 
the production with sets and costumes by john bury has its 
strong points especially act 3 a striking depiction of the 
smugglers mountain hideout 
this carmen will undergo numerous cast changes as the season 
wears on some later peformances will star marilyn horne in the 
title role and mirella freni will sing micaela twice

the canadaus free trade agreement could be 
called off after the nov 21 canadian election toronto bureau chief 
soll sussman spent two days on the road with opposition leader john 
turners campaign and filed this report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
opposition leader john turner on what he 
calls the crusade of a lifetime to halt the canadaus free trade 
agreement is whipping up campaign fervor with his attacks and 
clearly loving it 
for him prime minister brian mulroney sold out canada and became 
the head waiter at the white house by signing the pact with 
president reagan in january 
at a liberal party rally a crowd of about 2300 howled in 
approval when turner imitated the prime minister saluting and 
saying yes sir to every one of reagans requests 
mulroney wants to be governor of the 51st state turner says 
turner wants to be the prime minister of canada 
this election is a referendum on canadas future turner 
repeats at nearly every stop on his campaign for the nov 21 vote 
the potent singleminded message of canadian nationalism has 
revived the liberals campaign and put them in a dead heat with 
mulroneys progressive conservative party which won by a landslide 
in 1984 
it wasnt very long ago that liberal rallies were attracting 
handfuls of loyal supporters not standingroomonly crowds 
i can sense the momentum i can sense it the exuberant 
silverhaired turner yelled to his london audience a rock band 
played repeatedly the go johnny go refrain of chuck berrys 
johnny b good 
when the campaign began in october polls showed the liberals 
could slip to third place behind mulroney and the socialist new 
democratic party led by ed broadbent 
but a poll published thursday in the globe and mail indicated the 
liberals were leading with 37 percent support compared to 35 
percent for the conservatives and 24 percent for the new democrats 
the poll by the environics research group had a margin of error of 
27 percent 
perhaps in a mark of turners increased popularity hecklers now 
appear at almost every stop to shout out that he is misrepresenting 
the free trade agreement at london in southeastern ontario most 
were business students from the university of western ontario 
only a conservative majority will ensure the survival of the free 
trade agreement which would eliminate tariffs between the united 
states and canada over a 10year period beginning jan 1 
the liberals and the new democrats oppose the deal which has 
already been approved by the us congress it cant take effect 
until canadas parliament also approves it 
mulroney argues that the pact is needed to guarantee canadian 
access to us markets at a time of rising international 
protectionism 
turner argues that the agreement is too drastic a break from 120 
years of canadian history marked by resistance to pressures from the 
giant neighbor to the south 
he insists he does not oppose free trade and is not 
antiamerican but says the pact simply gives away too much by not 
recognizing the huge discrepancy in size and economic power between 
canada and the united states 
on the campaign trail he talks about preserving the canadian 
way not somebody elses way not the american way 
turner stopped at farms to dramatize his message that canadian 
farmers with their long winters and short growing seasons would be 
harmed by open competition with their southern counterparts 
he visited an auto parts plant and espoused his view that canada 
would be better served by taking a sectorbysector approach to 
trade such as the auto pact with the united states that has fueled 
ontarios prosperity rather than agreeing to one sweeping deal 
mulroney says his opponents are scare mongering with false 
and irrational arguments that the agreement would force canada to 
modify its system of strong social and health protection for its 
people 
canada and the united states already form the worlds biggest 
twonation trading partnership with more than 130 billion a year 
passing between them 
opponents of the free trade agreement note that 80 percent of the 
trade already is tarifffree 
the deals supporters however respond that it is deceptive to 
speak of it as affecting only the remaining 20 percent of current 
trade because they say the agreement will fuel growth to previously 
unimaginable levels

in 68 days ronald reagan will turn over the 
white house to george bush but in reality the transfer of power 
already is underway 
the clock is quickly running out on reagans presidency so 
congress the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments are 
searching for clues about what the next man will do 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher will be at the white house this week for farewell 
meetings with reagan they also want to see bush 
congress has quit for the year and wont be back until january 
foreclosing the possibility of any lastminute initiatives for 
lawmakers from reagan 
meanwhile a transition team named by the newly elected bush is 
developing legislative strategy and priorities for the first 100 
days of his presidency a period regarded as crucial for setting the 
right tone for a new administration 
out of the less than 10 weeks remaining in his presidency reagan 
plans to spend three weeks on vacation in california he will send a 
final budget to congress early next year but it wont get a second 
look unless lawmakers are assured it really represents what bush 
wants done 
the presidentelect gets all the attention said chase 
untermeyer newly named personnel chief for the bush transition 
team the incumbent president is the one that people have to be 
reminded of 
untermeyer hastened to add that reagan would be an exception to 
the rule 
sen claiborne pell dri said it is ironic that our 
constitution now provides automatically for up to 10 weeks of 
crippled leadership each time the presidency of our nation changes 
hands through elections pell has proposed a constitutional 
amendment to move up the inauguration to nov 20 instead of jan 20 
but his measure has generated little interest 
of course reagan is still in charge for the next 2 months 
the whole presidency is like an hourglass and there are very 
few sands left in the top of the hourglass said stephen hess 
senior fellow at brookings institution but nevertheless if 
something should happen ronald reagan has the authority and is the 
president until jan 20 
some senior members of reagans administration already have quit 
reagans cabinet and more than 500 top political appointees are 
being asked to submit their resignations effective at the pleasure 
of the president that will spare bush the unpleasantness of having 
to ask them to leave when he takes over jan 20 
in the top ranks a lucky few will be asked to stay although 
bush has promised a major overhaul to reinvigorate the government 
treasury secretary nicholas brady is expected to be asked this 
week to remain in his post education secretary lauro cavazos and 
attorney general dick thornburgh are considered possible holdovers 
throughout the ranks of government the jobs of about 5000 
political appointees could change hands many of those jobs will be 
determined at a secretarial level or lower and will not cross the 
presidents desk 
its not quite as horrifying as it may seem untermeyer said 
its in the hundreds rather than the thousands that really 
matter 
with 325 million provided by taxpayers bushs transition team 
set up shop on 3 floors of an office building in dupont circle not 
far from the white house 
in addition to combing through personnel resumes and planning 
bushs agenda the staff also is charged with drafting an 
organizational plan for the white house drawing lines of authority 
within the executive branch to help them with their work 
transition planners have at their disposal a computer system that is 
compatible with the one at the white house so they can easily take 
their work with them on jan 20 
bush already is ahead of schedule in starting to name his 
cabinet on the morning after his election he said that longtime 
friend james a baker iii would be his secretary of state 
bush said he would like to get the whole cabinet named sooner 
rather than way late 
in the modern presidency dwight eisenhower was the earliest to 
begin naming his cabinet and also was the first to complete the job 
he started on nov 20 and was finished by dec 1 
the latest to get started were richard nixon and ronald reagan 
who waited until dec 11 to begin naming cabinet members reagan was 
the latest to finish naming his last cabinet member education 
secretary terrell bell on jan 8 
when reagan won the presidency in 1980 his transition team 
swelled to about 1500 people untermeyer describes the transition 
from the reagan presidency is a friendly takeover and bush says 
he wants a somewhat leaner transition organization than we had in 
1980 
the reaganbush transition is unique not since 1929 when 
calvin coolidge was succeeded by herbert hoover has a president 
turned over the white house to a member of his own party 
bush said that makes his job easier 
you dont have to send teams out to every agency i know enough 
about how the government works were on the same general 
direction bush said we dont have to go out and reinvent the 
wheel

a fire set by arsonists damaged 
a university building today where the annual desmond tutu peace 
lecture was to be delivered police and student leaders said 
the building which was painted with antitutu slogans also 
houses the offices of a multiracial antiapartheid organization 
the offices were heavily damaged by the fire and files were stolen 
police said 
a detonator fuse and a flammable liquid were used to set fire to 
the offices of the national union of south african students in the 
building at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg 
police said 
sprinklers doused the fire but flooded the building damaging 
corridors lecture halls and equipment in the classrooms said 
stephen silver spokesman for the student organization 
also today police reported a limpet mine explosion damaged a 
railway track near east london on friday night and a black man was 
shot to death by an unidentified gunman in the natal province 
township of mpumalanga 
the fire caused an estimated 240000 damage to the building 
graffiti attacking tutu the nobel peace prizewinning anglican 
archbishop was painted on the outside of the building where an 
annual peace lecture bearing his name was to be delivered tonight 
tutu was invited to attend but was not planning to said spokesman 
john allen 
allen said the name of the speaker british rabbi julia 
neuberger was printed in small letters on posters and desmond 
tutu peace lecture was in large block letters possibly leading to 
the impression that he was to appear 
a police spokesman lt col frans malherbe said the fire was 
being investigated by a criminal division of the police force 
he said a phone recording machine and some files had been removed 
from the offices of the student organization but that neither 
security police nor the criminal investigators had removed anything 
he said police believed the same persons were responsible for the 
arson the graffiti and the thefts 
stephen kromberg national president of the student group said 
the attack is obviously aimed at intimidating us and disrupting 
our antiapartheid work 
the bombing of our offices follows a string of attacks on other 
antiapartheid organizations the police do not seem to have 
made much progress with these cases and we hope that they will treat 
this case with the seriousness it deserves 
malherbe said the detonator and fuse found at the scene had been 
used to light the fire and not for explosive purposes at this 
stage its being treated as an ordinary arson he said 
police gave no details on the death natal where at least 1000 
people have died in the past two years in fighting between black 
political groups for control of the townships 
police said they did not know when the limpet mine had exploded 
on the railway line near east london in eastern cape province but 
the damage and a second unexploded mine were discovered today 
services were not interrupted said transport spokesman louis du 
toit 
censorship rules imposed under the 29monthold state of 
emergency ban or restrict reporting about unrest security force 
actions treatment of detainees most forms of peaceful protest and 
a broad range of statements the government considers subversive

andrei d sakharov the stooped and aging 
father of the soviet hydrogen bomb brings to the nations 
capital a dramatic reminder of the plight of dissidents in his 
country but also how their burden has been eased by president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
at 67 the nobel peace prizewinning physicist speaks for soviet 
dissidents and sometimes for gorbachev 
he is an outspoken supporter of perestroika the attempt to 
reconstruct the ailing soviet economy but he has pleaded the case 
of dissidents and has questioned the power gorbachev derives from 
dual control of the communist party and the government 
a head of state with such powers in a country that does not 
have a multiparty system is just insanity sakharov said at a 
press conference in moscow before embarking on his first trip to the 
united states 
sakharov stands as an ardent spokesman for political prisoners 
and other dissidents listing those gorbachev should free the 
soviet leader complies with sakharovs requests but the worlds 
most celebrated human rights activist keeps pushing complimenting 
and criticizing 
a nonjew he is the symbol of soviet jews clamoring to 
emigrate and of armenians and other ethnic groups as well 
sakharov seeks to make the soviet union a kinder gentler nation 
and to expand political and religious freedom 
sakharov both has praised gorbachevs actions as deserving of 
respect thereby burnishing the soviet presidents image in the 
west and demanded more for the activists who remain in prison or in 
psychiatric institutions 
he has lobbied for gorbachev before journalists crowded into his 
moscow apartment and has spoken in the soviet leaders behalf to 
international audiences his praise of perestroika gives economic 
reform a credibility in the west derived from sakharovs reputation 
for independence 
two years ago sakharov became a free man at gorbachevs 
direction the politburo ended his virtual house arrest in gorki an 
industrial city 250 miles northeast of moscow where he had been sent 
in 1980 for criticizing the soviet invasion of afghanistan and 
emigration restrictions and allegedly defaming the state 
sakharov who won the nobel prize in 1975 for his human rights 
activism will be in washington through wednesday primarily to 
attend meetings of the international foundation for the survival and 
development of humanity a moscowbased group that supports research 
into such diverse fields as arms control environmental protection 
and energy and claims to be independent of all governments 
william g miller a former us foreign service officer and 
senate staffer who heads the foundations american office said 
saturday the monthold group was established by a soviet council of 
ministers decree the presence of academician sakharov in the 
united states is a direct consequence of the foundations new 
legitimacy miller said 
the american executive director said all the problems the 
foundation seeks to resolve require cooperation andrei sakharov 
has been in the forefront on these concerns for over 20 years 
miller said 
the chairman is yevgenii p velikhov a physicist and vice 
president of the soviet academy of sciences the vicechairman is 
jerome b wiesner former president of the massachusetts institute 
of technology other board members include former defense secretary 
robert s mcnamara and armand hammer the petroleum company 
executive 
the foundation operating with dollars and rubles plans to make 
grants for projects that require international cooperation and make 
recommendations to lending institutions and political leaders 
for the american public the highlights of sakharovs visit will 
be his meeting monday with president reagan and wednesday with 
secretary of state george p shultz and the speeches and news 
conferences he will hold on tuesday sakharov receives the 1988 
albert einstein peace prize and 50000 award 
norman cousins chairman of the selection board described 
sakharov as a person whose life proves that a single individual 
can truly make an enormous impact on the conscience of the world 
sakharov in defending gorbachevs economic reconstruction 
program has stressed its success would ease security concerns 
the failures of perestroika sakharov said would make 
expansion a political necessity and the country would be extremely 
dangerous in terms of world balance

at least 13 people were killed in a 
wave of ethnic violence officials said saturday and a fuel 
workers strike called by a radical sinhalese group raised fears of 
severe food shortages 
a military official said four people were killed and 20 others 
including 16 schoolchildren were injured when a car bomb exploded 
near jaffna 185 miles north of colombo on friday 
the official who cannot be identified under briefing rules said 
the victims were all minority tamils 
the bombing was blamed on members of the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam a militant group fighting for an independent tamil 
homeland on the islands north and east 
the official said the car bomb might have been aimed at indian 
troops posted in sri lanka to quell the tamil rebellion and that 
it probably exploded prematurely 
the bodies of five tamils abducted friday were found saturday in 
the town of kalumnai 136 miles east of colombo the official said 
the killings were blamed on the liberation tigers the largest and 
most powerful of the tamil militias 
the tigers are at the forefront of the tamils 5yearold war for 
a separate state the rebels say a tamil homeland is needed to 
combat alleged discrimination by sri lankas majority sinhalese 
members of the peoples liberation front a radical sinhalese 
group were blamed for killing four government supporters in central 
sri lanka on saturday 
the military official said four sinhalese including the brother 
of a government lawmaker and three of his supporters were killed in 
a car ambush at the town of kurunegala 52 miles northeast of 
colombo 
in southern sri lanka a strike by fuel workers led to gasoline 
shortages and a breakdown in the distribution of food authorities 
said 
sufficient food supplies have been sent to the southern port town 
of galle but gasoline shortages prevented distribution to other 
towns in the region food commissioner graham dissanayake said 
about 2500 employees of the ceylon petroleum corp the island 
nations only supplier of gasoline walked off the job monday in 
response to a strike call by the peoples liberation front which is 
demanding the resignation of president junius r jayewardene

death by hanging for people convicted of instigating strikes or 
refusing to report for work in essential services sectors such 
as fuel and transportation 
this strikes were the latest in a series called by the front 
which opposes jayewardenes peace overtures to tamil rebels it says 
it wont be satisfied until the president resigns 
presidential elections are scheduled dec 19 but the front 
claims the jayewardene government is incapable of conducting a fair 
vote jayewardene is barred by the constitution from seeking a third 
term in the election

the supreme court today ordered that 
pakistani voters must show identification cards before casting 
ballots in the november elections for the national and provincial 
legislatures 
the 12member court issued an injunction blocking a lower court 
ruling on tuesday that rejected the id requirement which had been 
challenged by the main opposition pakistan peoples party which is 
led by benazir bhutto 
the party claimed many of pakistans 48 million eligible voters 
do not have id cards especially women who refuse to be photographed 
according to moslem religious laws that require women to veil their 
faces in public 
the government said that about 93 percent of the electorate have 
the cards but the lower court found that in some districts records 
showed there are more id cards than eligible voters 
the government appealed to the supreme court on the grounds that 
identity cards are the only way to prevent fraud at polling stations 
the supreme court said it issued the injunction because there 
wasnt enough time to consider the governments appeal before the 
nov 16 elections for the national assembly and the nov 19 
elections for the provincial legislatures

at the end michael dukakis said hed learned 
something in his failure one of the lessons of the campaign is 
you have to respond and you have to respond quickly 
some who had campaigned for him groaned when they heard it if 
this was the lesson it was one they had learned long before and had 
tried repeatedly to tell dukakis and his high command 
thats the first lesson of ward politics said michael 
goldman a boston political consultant brought in late in the 
campaign as an adviser 
dukakis was faulted all fall for his failure to respond to strong 
attacks on his record from the bush campaign in the last weeks of 
his campaign he acknowledged that he had dallied too long 
his failure to respond was most observers believe a large 
reason he was unsuccessful but it was not the full story of why the 
governor of massachusetts failed as democratic presidential nominee 
rather it reflected a larger problem a candidate and campaign 
that were aloof and parochial and many felt arrogant 
dukakis and his campaign badly underestimated their opponent 
they resisted outside advice until it was too late they failed to 
find a message and voice until the race had been lost and in fact 
had no effective strategy after winning the nomination 
they squandered months delivering little more than bland 
bromides and they failed utterly to recognize the devastating 
impact the other sides attacks were having even as dukakis image 
was being undermined 
they didnt know people said atlanta mayor andrew young 
young was referring to dukakis advisers and consultants but 
interviews with those inside the campaign suggest the same might 
well be said of the candidate himself 
a number of top campaign staffers including manager susan 
estrich top strategist john sasso political aides kirk odonnell 
and jack corrigan are all named as fingerpointing goes on in a 
democratic party distraught at its latest failure estrich in 
particular is blamed by some in the party for allowing the 
campaigns summer aimlessness and for her harvard law school 
approach to hotbutton issues 
what stands out in memory from the long dukakis campaign are 
missed opportunities by a team unprepared for the rough and tumble 
of a general election campaign 
before the convention beginning to feel the republicans 
needles dukakis responded with breathtaking naivete that bush 
should stop criticizing others 
dukakis let pass the opportunity to address defense and foreign 
policy matters in a substantive way early on when he could have 
inoculated himself against coming attacks 
day after day through the summer and much of the fall dukakis 
virtually conceded the evening television news stories and the next 
days newspaper stories to the other side 
dukakis never seemed to adjust to his role as a national figure 
on a national stage he and his campaign were consumed by what was 
in the boston press even in the campaigns final days a 
reflection it seemed of his insulated and confined view 
dukakis once remarked that no ads went out of his campaign 
without his personal approval but his campaign was effectively 
paralyzed unable to mount a cogent television campaign 
republican strategists made no secret of their plans to try to 
damage dukakis record and reputation in the spring and summer they 
even pointed to the prison furlough and pledge of allegiance issues 
they would exploit yet when it came the dukakis campaign seemed 
ill prepared 
as bush hammered dukakis some within the campaign grew angry at 
their own inability to respond even lloyd bentsen complained 
everybody was frustrated by the unwillingness to deal with 
it said one campaign official insisting on anonymity 
as a result campaign staffers out in the field sometimes worked 
around dukakis and his campaign hierarchy in some states they 
secretly printed and circulated tough ads and brochures that werent 
approved by the headquarters in boston a bootleg 
counterslash one official called it 
dukakis and his top campaign officials in boston didnt seem to 
understand the values and symbolism behind those issues bush had 
chosen dukakis seemed to assume that the nation knew him as 
massachusetts voters did 
he could not believe that the son of immigrants could ever be 
spun around on the pledge of allegiance said goldman because 
mike dukakis didnt see himself as a liberal he couldnt say what 
he wasnt 
the result was that dukakis after carefully crafting a candidacy 
based on moderation and problemsolving came to be seen as 
something culturally different to much of the country 
he never looked like a fighter until the last couple weeks when 
he finally found a populist theme that connected with voters and the 
ability to say it convincingly but by then it was too late and he 
was just fighting to avoid embarrassment

hungary has approved draft legislation 
that allows a multiparty political system in principle but does not 
include the framework for independent parties the justice minister 
was quoted as saying today 
the draft bill was approved by the communist government thursday 
and goes before parliament later this month it refers to the right 
of individuals and groups to establish political parties 
while the text recognizes the possibility of organizing 
political parties it also stipulates that they cannot be organized 
on the basis of this law on association the communist daily 
nepszabadsag quoted justice minister kalman kulcsar as saying 
kulcsar was quoted as saying a separate law not likely to be 
ready before 1990 will set up guidelines and regulate the 
establishment of political parties 
there has been extensive debate in hungary in recent months over 
the feasibility of a multiparty system dozens of independent groups 
have formed many with political platforms that are seen as a 
nucleus of a party 
under the draft bill a multiparty system is acceptable in 
principle while its concrete realization requires a transitional 
period kulcsar was quoted as saying 
leaders of independent groups have been cautious about expressing 
too much optimism over the announcement of the party reference in 
the draft bill 
rudolf joo a member of the independent democratic forum with a 
membership of some 7000 described it as a step forward on the 
way to democratization but it was announced in such a contradictory 
manner that it limits our enthusiasm for it 
but he said that after 40 years of single party rule new 
parties cannot appear from one day to the next 
on friday janos berecz chief ideologist of hungarys ruling 
communist party told reporters that politcal reforms in hungary is 
a longterm process 
hungarys leadership under comnunist party chief karoly grosz has 
permitted more openness in the media 
grosz also backs strict austerity measures including personal 
income taxes to help reduce the foreign debt and to stimulate the 
stagnating economy

there they go again as president reagan might 
say before he turns out the lights in the oval office on his way 
back to the ranch 
the same people who said mario cuomo would defeat bob dole for 
the white house this fall are making odds on how quickly 
presidentelect bush will have his legislative agenda chewed up by 
an implacably hostile democratic congress 
the argument goes this way bush was elected after a campaign 
based largely on distortions of michael dukakis record was 
extremely skimpy on the specifics and he doesnt have much of a 
chance against congressional leaders who won just as big at the 
polls as he did 
his problem is going to be that theres going to be virtually 
no honeymoon says david keene a wellknown conservative who 
worked for dole 
it might turn out that way and it is worth noting that 1988 is 
the first election in 28 years in which a president of one party was 
elected while the opposition party gained seats in the house 
and bush did devote a lot of attention in his campaign to 
attacking dukakis on highly emotional issues such as crime without 
providing many details of his flexible freeze or his call for a 
kinder gentler nation 
one of the lines best remembered read my lips no new taxes 
will be put to the test no doubt 
but the conventional wisdom turned out to be wrong in the crunch 
as often as not during the campaign that ended on tuesday 
remember the experts who said bushs candidacy would unravel 
swiftly after dole defeated him in iowas republican caucuses it 
did until the next election eight days later in new hampshire that 
doomed dole 
the same experts said none of the announced democratic candidates 
could ever win the nomination and that new york gov cuomo would 
sweep the convention but they were wrong 
among the reasons bush won the white house this year as campaign 
manager lee atwater is fond of saying is that his enemies 
consistently underestimated him also his inner circle was far 
superior to anyone elses the same team that patiently plotted the 
postconvention political blitz that sent bush surging past dukakis 
now has 10 weeks to plan a fast getaway from the new administration 
theres no reason to think it wont be done with the same 
thoroughness 
for all the talk of a mandate for the democratic congress the 
senators and representatives also know that bush won 40 states many 
of them by substantial margins 
bush already has signalled his hopes for a constructive 
relationship with congress 
he conspicuously avoided saying he had a mandate when he 
fielded questions from reporters on wednesday im going to do 
everything i can to have good and open and friendly relationships 
with the united states congress and i dont want us to talk at each 
other i want us to talk to each other he later added 
secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii the first 
appointee is highly regarded by congressional leaders who know him 
as reagans firstterm chief of staff and then as treasury secretary 
bush is widely expected to ask nicholas brady to stay on as 
treasury secretary in the new government brady who served several 
months as an appointed senator was swiftly confirmed for his 
cabinet post 
asked at his news conference whether his injunction against 
taxes included all socalled revenue enhancements bush ducked he 
noted that dukakis had criticized him for supporting an increase in 
the medicare premiums to finance catastrophic health care coverage 
youll have to define what you mean he added 
no matter what the experts predict congress and a president 
sometimes have a way of working together when least expected 
like this year 
the electionyear democratic congress that adjourned last month 
and the most conservative president in a generation a lame duck to 
boot agreed on a bill to combat drug abuse an overhaul of welfare 
laws a trade bill a plant closing bill and also agreed on all 13 
individual appropriations bill for the first time in many years

rome on saturday in a huge protest called by italys trade unions 
over the governments tax policies 
estimates by union organizers witnesses news agencies and the 
staterun rai television put the turnout at 300000 to 400000 
the protesters who came from all over italy by special trains 
and buses marched past the colosseum and converged in the square in 
front of st john lateran church 
there they waved banners chanted slogans and listened to 
speeches by the leaders of the three main trade unions the speakers 
said the unions which are joined in a confederation would consider 
calling a nationwide general strike unless the government acts on 
their demands

present tax system favors tax evaders and unfairly penalizes workers 
and retirees they dubbed the demonstration the march of the 
honest ones 
the crowd chanted we already pay its time that everybody 
pays and carried placards and signs with slogans such as 
handcuffs for tax evaders and their protectors 
on the fiscal side we should all be equal in the eye of the 
state and pay taxes in relation to what we possess said antonio 
pizzinato secretarygeneral of the communistdominated general 
confederation of italian workers 
thats not the way it is today under the existing structure 
he told the crowd there are those who pay everything on 
everything and those are the workers and the retirees and there are 
those who evade or pay minimal amounts 
giorgio benvenuto leader of the socialistled italian union of 
work said the state lost the equivalent of 40 billion in revenue 
from tax evasion in 1988 an insult to those honest taxpayers 
the union leaders are scheduled to meet soon with 
parliamentarians who are debating the proposed 1989 national budget

concern over nuclear contamination has been growing as the energy 
department discloses more and more problems at the nuclear weapons 
production plants that it runs in 13 states the department has said 
it will cost up to 110 billion to clean up environmental 
contamination at 17 major plants 
those plants constitute a public health emergency said dr 
h jack geiger a medical professor in new york and spokesman for 
the antinuclear group physicians for social responsibility 
geiger calling the weapons complex a creeping chernobyl is 
urging the federal government to commission extensive studies of the 
effect of radiation from the plants on surrounding populations 
in fact the federal government has spent about 2 billion 
sponsoring dozens of studies on nuclear workers and neighbors but 
has come up without a clear picture of the health risks 
research is hampered by shifts in population near nuclear plants 
and problems measuring exactly how much radiation people are exposed 
to moreover the rate of excess cancer is hard to determine against 
a national population in which according to the american cancer 
society an estimated one out of three americans will eventually 
have cancer 
the whole situation is rather puzzling said seymour jablon 
an expert at the national cancer institute in the washington suburb 
of bethesda the only thing that is really sticking its head up is 
leukemia especially among children 
to gain a clearer picture of the risks the cancer institute is 
harnessing a mainframe computer to study health mortality and 
morbidity data from 127 us counties which host or are next to 
nuclear power plants or weapons processing facilities the results 
will be compared with rates from 400 other counties not near 
reactors 
the project began last january and results are expected by the 
end of next summer said jablon 
several studies of populations near british reactors have showed 
higher than average rates of leukemia and other types of cancers 
and some studies of workers at the savannah river plant in aiken 
sc and at the hanford nuclear reservation in richland wash 
show higher than average rates for some types of cancers 
another study of children in utah exposed to fallout from atomic 
tests in nevada 1951 to 1958 showed a higher rate of leukemia 
but the results of those studies have been disputed by other 
researchers and some scientists say they do not present a general 
pattern that would prove nuclear plants pose a threat 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
which has been scathingly critical of the energy departments safety 
and environmental practices reviewed many of those studies and 
concluded in a twovolume report in 1981 that there is as yet no 
way to determine precisely the cancer risks of lowlevel ionizing 
radiation and it is unlikely that this question will be resolved 
soon 
for workers at nuclear plants generally exposed to higher levels 
of radiation than nearby residents the most general statement we 
can say is that overall mortality is similar to or better than the 
general population said dr shirley a fry head of epidemiologic 
research at oak ridge associated universities in oak ridge tenn 
which is conducting research under contract for the energy 
department 
we have seen in several populations an elevation of one type of 
cancer or another but there is no pattern she said 
scientists may have trouble measuring exposure rates among 
nuclear neighbors but the government now admits some cases of 
extensive radiation release 
one of the grimmest was the release in december 1949 of massive 
amounts of radioactive iodine 131 from the hanford plant 
the socalled green run apparently was intended to help us 
intelligence officials develop means of tracking suspected radiation 
leaks from the soviet nuclear weapons program 
june stark casey a sophomore at whitman college in walla walla 
wash in 1949 said that after the release she became weak and 
began to lose hair 
my parents spent thousands of dollars taking me from doctor to 
doctor although these are common effects of overexposure to 
radiation the cause didnt occur to my parents because the releases 
were kept secret casey was quoted as saying in the bulletin of 
atomic scientists 
the links between cancer and high levels of radiation are better 
documented most convincingly in studies of 50000 survivors of the 
atomic bomb attacks on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki 
among those exposed to massive doses of radiation from the bombs 
researchers found 480 excess cancers including about 100 leukemias 
followed by cancers of the lung stomach colon female breast and 
thyroid said jablon of the national cancer institute 
the lack of persuasive scientific data has not persuaded critics 
that no link exists between lowlevel radiation doses and cancer 
they dont have good data the means they have to measure 
disease are too crude and what they are looking for is subtle but 
that doesnt mean that we dont have problems said frances close 
hart chairwoman of the environmental research foundation an 
environmental group in columbia sc and an active critic of the 
savannah river plant in aiken

the official portrait of this years city 
council shows one alderman an outspoken community leader sitting 
at his desk with a paper bag over his head 
i hope it does hang in city hall because i feel people 
throughout history will ask just as you did why is that guy 
wearing a bag over his head alderman michael r mcgee said 
saturday 
well it was just my response to my total embarrassment of the 
conduct of my fellow council members during the last budget 
process he said i was utterly embarrassed to be seen with them 
in an official picture 
it was a way to poke a little fun at them also 
mcgee donned the bag with cutout eyes and a drawing of a smile 
at thursdays portrait session and refused to remove it 
mcgee said he was protesting the councils easy approval of mayor 
john o norquists austerity budget which trimmed police fire and 
health department budgets 
i think through history this council will become known as the 
council that wimped out he said 
mcgee said programs affected by the cuts were particularly 
important to inner city residents he said more than 250 people 
appeared at public hearings to protest the cuts but were given no 
consideration 
council president thomas p donegan declined to say if this 
years portrait would hang in the city hall corridor with council

president reagan marking his last veterans 
day as president said today he leaves office gratified that once 
again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their 
country 
the president delivered his weekly radio address from camp david 
the presidential retreat in maryland to which he flew friday after 
veterans day observances at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington 
national cemetery and at the vietnam veterans memorial 
his remarks echoed a note he has sounded often in recent weeks as 
he campaigned for vice president george bush the republican 
candidate who was elected tuesday as his successor 
on this the last veterans day i will commemorate as 
president i would like to say that if there is one change george 
bush and i made that touches me most profoundly it would probably be 
this once again our young men and women are proud to wear the 
uniform of their country 
reagan did not elaborate on the remark but has often boasted 
that his administration began rebuilding american military might 
after a period of neglect when he took over from democratic 
president jimmy carter in 1981 
at arlington reagan paid tribute to the service of all veterans 
and war dead on behalf of a nation that today and always pledges 
itself to their eternal memory 
at the memorial he focused on the nations most recent war 
saying that those who served in vietnam are now universally 
recognized as having earned a badge of pride 
in our hearts you will always be young he said of the dead 
the president and his wife nancy both dressed in black and 
walking handinhand left a handwritten note addressed to our 
young friends at the base of the chevronshaped blackgranite wall 
on which the 58000 names of the vietnam war dead are inscribed 
you fought for your country and for its safety and for the 
freedom of others with strength and courage said the brief note 
placed near the flowers letters flags medals and other items left 
by thousands of visitors to the memorial 
a crowd of several thousand people standing on the wet grass and 
autumn leaves heard reagan declare that although the war divided the 
nation the flow of thousands of boat people from vietnam mass 
murders in cambodia and other events are evidence the cause was 
just however imperfectly pursued 
presidentelect george bush in a statement issued from florida 
where he is vacationing noted that it was the first veterans day 
since reagan signed into law the bill creating the cabinetlevel 
department of veterans affairs 
this is a distinction that americas veterans have earned and 
richly deserve bush said it guarantees that those who have 
worn the uniform of our armed forces will always have a strong voice 
in our government 
reagan in his speech expressed gratitude to the gentle 
heroes of vietnam and said the government was doing everything 
possible to learn whether american soldiers are still captive in 
southeast asia 
he said unless the government of vietnam gives assurances that 
there arent any who are alive we will assume some are and will 
do everything we can to find them

only in public schools are children exposed to a 
diversity of cultures that will help them relate to people around 
the world mayor andrew young told a group of educators 
i may have neglected my studies but i sure got an education 
young said referring to his childhood in the segregated public 
schools in new orleans by the time i left elementary school i 
was an accomplished negotiator nobody wants to fight youre 
chicken if you run so to survive you have to negotiate 
one of the problems underlying the countrys international trade 
deficit he said is that many industrial leaders went to private 
schools and exclusive colleges where all the students are alike 
were running a 170 billion trade deficit essentially because 
the captains of american industry dont know how to deal with people 
who are different young said in a keynote address friday to the 
national education association national conference 
the ability to get along with people from different cultures is a 
lesson best learned in the public school said young former

penthouse magazine publisher bob 
guccione can buy a 12 million boardwalk tract where a hotel casino 
was once proposed a state appeals court said 
the court ruling thursday was the latest decision in nine years 
of litigation over the site 
guccione became embroiled in a lawsuit with greta and joseph 
shamy who were under contract to buy the site in 1977 according to 
court papers 
the shamys of galloway township and guccione had agreed to form 
a corporation to buy the property and develop a new hotel casino 
but the shamys sued for breach of contract in 1979 
seven years later after numerous court hearings a superior 
court judge ordered the property sold in competitive bidding 
gucciones attorney henry n luter of morristown said guccione 
and an investment group put together by the shamys made separate 
offers 
a courtappointed receiver recommended the property go to 
guccione for the 12 million he already had invested 
judges herman d michels and john d keefe of the appellate 
division of superior court affirmed the receivers recommendation

i want my signs back and if any of them are damaged theyre 
going to have to pay for them ill sue them if i have to said 
jay dibenedetto a losing candidate for winnebago county board 
i plan on running again and a lot of my signs can be used the 
next time dibenedetto said 
the controversy was sparked when wybrfm offered 104 its 
frequency to the listener who scored the largest load of campaign 
signs 
the station received 1800 placards and publicity from local news

but politicians began complaining thursday and station employees 
worked to sort out the pile and make peace 
circuit court clerk ron kotche said several candidates were 
unhappy

the civil aviation ministry is 
considering painting eyes on indian airlines planes to scare away 
birds and prevent aircraft from hitting them news reports said 
saturday 
united news of india quoted shivraj patil as saying that the 
eyes used in japan to avoid birdplane collision were being 
considered for indian airlines 
bird hits are fairly common in india according to a recent study 
by the international airports authority of india which is 
responsible for the upkeep of domestic airports indian airlines 
aircraft reported 26 bird hits in september 
the hits caused a loss of 135 million the study said 
birds are usually sucked in through the jet engines and cause 
severe mechanical damage because the hits are usually within 
minutes of takeoff or landing they can be dangerous 
an air show scheduled jan 26 which was to feature indian air 
force jets flying over new dehli was canceled this year because of

as presidentelect george bushs transition 
team moved into its new headquarters and aides devised procedures 
for picking leaders of the next administration president reagan 
said today that bush has gotten his mandate from the american 
people 
we the people can take pride in just how strong our political 
system is the president said in his weekly radio address 
delivered from the presidential retreat at camp david md we have 
made our choice and life goes on 
george bush has gotten his mandate from the american people a 
mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and 
prosperity to the american people to bring hope and opportunity to 
all americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the 
world the president said 
bush meanwhile vacationed in gulf stream fla friday where he 
said little about his plans for the transition he reiterated that 
there would be no personnel announcements until after he returns to 
the nations capital monday or tuesday 
asked if he was compiling lists of potential appointees bush 
said no no 
robert teeter codirector of the transition with craig fuller 
chief of staff in the vice presidents office said the two men 
planned to spend the weekend mulling over procedures for the 
personnel selection process they will confer early next week after 
the transition office officially opens on monday 
well go to him bush on tuesday or wednesday when he gets 
back and give him some recommendations teeter said in a telephone 
interview from his home in michigan 
a key player in deciding who serves under bush is chase 
untermeyer the personnel director untermeyer who met friday with 
vice presidentelect dan quayle would be in his new office monday 
an aide said 
speculation was rampant meanwhile about whom bush would name to 
the top jobs so far bush has picked only one cabinet member 
former treasury secretary and campaign chairman james a baker iii 
as secretary of state 
asked about speculation that treasury secretary nicholas brady a 
bush confidant would remain in the job the vice president 
responded theyve been saying that for weeks he refused to 
comment further 
a source on the transition team refusing to be quoted by name 
said bush was looking for a new face to replace william webster as 
cia director 
bush who served as cia director in 1976 is expected to take a 
keen interest in filling that job his desire to look at other 
people does not necessarily mean he is dissatisfied with websters 
performance the transition source said but the vice president 
want to put his own stamp on things he said 
bush said as much at a news conference on wednesday i will for 
the most part bring in a brand new team of people from across the 
country he said 
associates of webster have said privately that the cia director 
is eager to stay on in the post he took over in may 1987 earlier in 
the bush campaign webster was told he could keep his job but since 
then all he has read in published reports are the names of possible 
successors the sources said 
one possible candidate for cia director is james lilley the 
ambassador to south korea whom bush has known since lilley was the 
chief of the cia station in beijing while bush was us envoy to 
china in the 1970s 
the source said former texas republican sen john tower was still 
the frontrunner for secretary of defense although the mention of 
paul h oneill chairman and chief executive of alcoa is no 
accident 
brent scowcroft the national security adviser under former 
president ford could get the same post in the bush administration 
the source said but congressional sources indicated there was talk 
scowcroft might take over the cia 
another source meantime said fuller and retiring new hampshire 
gov john sununu were candidates for white house chief of staff 
it could go either way said the source speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
teeter and sheila tate the transitions spokeswoman refused to 
comment any job speculation

the murder case against a disbarred lawyer 
accused of beating his adopted daughter to death rests on 
circumstantial evidence which can be a stumbling block with jurors 
according to a legal expert 
prosecutors in the joel steinberg trial admit they have no 
eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking him directly to 6yearold 
lisas death so they must try to disprove every reasonable 
possibility except the defendants guilt 
richard uviller professor of criminal law at columbia university 
law school said the word circumstantial is perceived as 
dirty in the minds of many jurors the prosecutors first task 
is to overcome this prejudice he said 
circumstantial evidence should not necessarily be thought of as 
inferior uviller said last week it is no different than other 
kinds of evidence 
steinberg 47 is on trial in the death of the illegally adopted 
child the chubbycheeked firstgrader was removed unconscious from 
steinbergs greenwich village apartment nov 2 1987 she died three 
days later 
the death of the little girl in an affluent welleducated 
household shocked many new yorkers and led to a reexamination of 
the duty and ability of neighbors teachers and social workers to 
recognize and report evidence of child abuse 
prosecutors have introduced photographs showing wounds and 
bruises on both his livein companion and lisa that were so grim 
they visibly disturbed many jurors prosecutors also have called or 
will call witnesses to testify that 
only steinberg his livein companion hedda nussbaum and a 
16monthold boy were with lisa when she received her fatal injury 
lisas fatal head injury was consistent with a blow from a man 
steinbergs size and that she could not have gotten it from falling 
down 
steinbergs knuckles were red swollen and scratched the day 
lisa was hospitalized and he was arrested 
ms nussbaum was too physically and emotionally injured to have 
done anything to lisa or to protect the child from the only father 
she ever knew 
steinberg lied when he told police that the child fell 
unconscious after choking on vegetables 
steinberg told reporters there were no bruises on lisa even 
though they were on every part of her body as she lay comatose in a 
hospital 
uviller said a number of strong indicators of guilt though 
circumstantial may be more convincing than eyewitnesses he 
pointed out that in a circumstantial case the judge must tell the 
jury they need a moral certainity to find guilt 
the prosecutor should show exclusive opportunity to commit 
the crime and motivation and disposition based on past 
behavior uviller said 
the task of the defense is the opposite of the prosecution 
uviller said to show that possibilities exist other than the 
defendants guilt 
in his opening statement assistant district attorney peter 
casolaro told jurors that virtually all the evidence was 
circumstantial but he promised that the facts and circumstances 
taken together would prove the defendants guilt 
ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens book editor is expected to 
testify for the prosecution after thanksgiving she was also charged 
with lisas death but charges were dropped in return for her 
testimony 
ms nussbaum spent the past year getting medical and psychiatric 
treatment for injuries her lawyer barry scheck says she received 
at steinbergs hands scheck says that although the law recognized 
she was unable to help lisa and forgave her she will never 
forgive herself 
steinberg received lisa the day she was born to an unwed 
teenager michele launders ms launders said she paid steinberg 
500 for filing fees after he promised to place the baby with a 
middleclass catholic family instead he kept the child for himself 
and ms nussbaum who are jewish 
ms launders now 27 watches the trial daily from the front row 
occasionally crying and frequently glaring at steinberg 
the 16monthold boy police found in the apartment also was 
obtained illegally from an unwed teenager he has been returned to 
his natural mother 
the physician who arranged the boys transfer to steinberg 
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor illegally placing a child for 
adoption and is awaiting sentence

nobody knows now if little paolo had a family 
name when he was born workmens families in old italy often did 
without one when he died at 60 he no longer needed one everybody 
knew him just as veronese the painter from verona 
the national gallery of art is commemorating his death 400 years 
ago with the opening sunday of the biggest show of his work ever 
seen in this country there will be 50 paintings and 55 drawings 
brought together with the help of a grant from the ford motor co 
veronese the son of a stonecutter did both secular and 
religious work feeling for everyday life comes out in many of them 
whatever the theme 
a favorite subject was the holy family resting on their flight 
into egypt a donkey is featured in at least three depictions of 
that scene one of them adds what the catalog calls a rather 
illogical cow in another an acrobatic angel picks dates from a 
tree and tosses them into an apron held by a second angel while a 
third attends to the donkey and a fourth is hanging laundry on a 
bush 
there is scholarly disagreement about the laundry the catalog 
calls it a baby dress beverly louise brown curator of the 
show thinks it is something that belongs to the virgin mary 
the painting comes from the ringling museum in sarasota fla 
veroneses exuberance got him into trouble on a painting of the 
last supper church authorities called him to task for including 
buffoons drunkards germans dwarfs and other such 
scurrilities they did not mention the soldiers dogs and exotic 
animals 
by changing the name to the feast in the house of levi he 
saved the canvas from being burned it is now in venice 
almost all the paintings in this exhibit have been recently 
cleaned which shows up the brilliant color veronese is known for 
three were so brilliant italian authorities had second thoughts 
about lending them 
when the italian authorities had a look at them after the 
cleaning they did a doubletake said j carter brown director of 
the gallery 
the three works are largerthanlife paintings of saints from 
modena italy one of them saint menna may be a selfportrait of 
veronese 
ms brown said that unlike american museums italian museums must 
submit their proposals for loans to the national government they 
are reviewed by the ministry of foreign affairs she recalled cases 
when loans agreements were canceled by the government at the last 
moment 
its their artistic patrimony you know she said they 
dont like some things to leave the country even on loan 
the paintings did arrive and were hung but only on thursday the 
exhibit has been in preparation for four years 
it will close feb 20

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address broadcast saturday from camp david md 
my fellow americans this week we witnessed a glorious event we 
the people going to the polls to determine our political destiny 
i guess i dont need to tell you i think the united states of 
america did itself proud with the selection of george bush as the 
41st president of the united states and dan quayle as his vice 
president 
george bush has gotten his mandate from the american people the 
mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and 
prosperity to bring hope and opportunity to all americans and to 
expand the frontiers of freedom around the world 
you know all year long people were saying it was time for a 
change well by your choice this week you proved we were right when 
we said we george bush dan quayle and the republican party are 
the change it began eight years ago and its going to continue 
but some things dont change like the glory of the american 
political system we saw it at work on tuesday after the dust 
cleared and the people had spoken that night the nation was 
fortunate to witness the grace and dignity of the democratic 
candidate governor dukakis as he congratulated george bush in his 
victory he ran a tough race full of energy and purpose and i 
salute him for his dedication and courage 
on tuesday night and in the days that have followed it and in 
the 10 weeks before january 20th 1989 we the people can take pride 
in just how strong our political system really is we take it for 
granted sometimes but i couldnt help thinking on tuesday night 
how inspiring it is that we know we americans can choose our leader 
without fear of violence all americans from hawaii to maine know 
that when the voice of the people is heard even the mightiest among 
us must bow before it and accept its wisdom 
presidentelect bush said it well the other day we can now 
speak the most magestic words that democracy has to offer the 
people have spoken 
only twice in our history during the dark days of our civil war 
has anyone dared to question the wisdom of the american people as 
they chose their president dared to deny the validity of the 
selection 
in other nations a disgruntled group of defeated politicians 
might try to stage a coup detat or might even follow our disastrous 
mistake from the 1960s and go to war brother against brother 
rather than consent to the will of the people 
but here we americans are just four days after one of the most 
important nights in our history working or playing or just enjoying 
our weekend weve made our choice and life goes on we dont even 
need to give it a thought but when we do i think its cause for us 
to wonder at our freedom 
we continue to enjoy our freedom because of those brave americans 
among us who have legitimately taken up arms in the service of their 
country protecting and defending the united states of america this 
weekend we commemorate americas veterans those who did their 
duty so that we could be free and strong so that tyranny could find 
no quarter so that we could live in peace 
i think of the example of staff sergeant carlos stollard one of 
the gold star men in world war ii in a 1944 letter to his parents 
carlos wrote i believe in making that future a place where little 
children can go swimming and playing around their homes without 
being mangled for life from bursting bombs and flaming debris that 
was once their homes so that they can have a mothers care instead 
of being left in some dark corner shivering with cold and dying with 
hunger and wondering if mother in a concentration camp is being 
cruelly beaten or if she is dead thats what we are fighting for 
and i would gladly give ten lives if i had them 
well like all of us carlos stollard had but one life to give 
for his country he died in action in france on july 26 1944 
his heroic example reminds us why sometimes we must take up arms so 
that we can live free and at peace every veteran in this country 
deserves our thanks and gratitude this weekend of all weekends 
and my friends on this the last veterans day i will 
commemorate as president i would like to say that if there is one 
change george bush and i made that touches me most profoundly it 
would probably be this once again our young men and women are 
proud to wear the uniform of their country flight lieutenant george 
bush sure was 
until next week thanks for listening and may god bless you

bolivian farmers brought three times as much 
new land under coca cultivation in 1987 as the government of that 
country eradicated under an agreement with the united states 
congressional investigators said 
widespread corruption in bolivia and the violence of the drug 
lords in colombia along with greatly increased cultivation have 
rendered us state department antidrug programs in those countries 
ineffective investigators for the general accounting office wrote 
in a report last week 
gao did not examine the programs of the drug enforcement agency 
in bolivia and colombia 
colombia is the worlds largest producer of cocaine which is 
made from the coca leaf and the source of 75 percent of the us 
supply production capacity for 1987 was estimated by the state 
department at 143 tons bolivia is the secondranking producer with 
capacity of 99 tons 
state department antidrug expenditures in the two countries will 
have totaled 106 million by the end of the current fiscal year 
with current annual spending about 10 million in each country 
spending by the drug enforcement agency and drugrelated spending by 
the agency for international development in both countries add 156 
million a year 
a voluntary coca eradication program wiped out 2570 acres in 
1987 and early 1988 an alltime high for bolivia but an 
estimated 8150 acres were brought under cultivation making the 
total about 100000 acres the report said 
bolivian narcotics interdiction efforts during 1987 were even 
less impressive since only 2 percent of the coca paste produced in 
bolivia was seized in addition to 148 kilograms 326 pounds of 
cocaine the gao report said 
colombia has made a notable effort to combat coca cultivation and 
processing and has been the most cooperative of all andean countries 
but was unable to prevent farmers from increasing coca area from 
38300 acres in 1985 to 61800 acres in 1987 gao wrote 
colombian eradication fell from 4940 acres in 1985 to 1140 
acres in 1987 though seizures of laboratories nearly doubled from 
725 to 1360 in the same time 
the murders of judges government ministers police officers and 
editors has made it extremely difficult for the government of 
colombia to recruit qualified individuals to serve in police and 
judicial offices the report said 
us expectations may exceed the realistically achievable goals 
and the effect that a 10 million narcotics control program can have 
on a wellestablished multibillion dollar industry in colombia 
the report said 
narcotics corruption is viewed as the largest single problem 
affecting us narcotics control efforts in bolivia according to 
several us and bolivian officials corruption exists within all 
levels of the bolivian government and very few government officials 
can be trusted gao said 
the report said coca eradication efforts were bound to remain 
futile until an effective herbicide is used in aerial spraying 
programs as colombia does with marijuana

the five astronauts scheduled to fly 
a classified military space shuttle mission late this month arrived 
here saturday for training and a countdown test 
its going to be a busy couple days commander robert gibson 
told reporters after he and his fellow crewmen flew in from their 
training base in houston 
asked if nasa had set a launch date for the secret mission aboard 
the shuttle atlantis gibson replied were still marching toward 
the 28th but theres a possibility of a couple days the other side 
of that 
actually those couple days already have been added with the 
range schedule now listing the launch date as nov 30 shuttle 
managers will set a firm date wednesday following a twoday flight 
readiness review 
gibson said his crew is very excited about the flight much 
of which is cloaked in secrecy because of its military nature 
sources have reported the astronauts will deploy a huge defense 
department intelligencegathering satellite that will fly over 80 
percent of the soviet union 
the exact launch time and length of the mission are classified 
after atlantis reaches orbit there will be a blackout on 
information until the end of the flight 
following the astronauts arrival gibson and pilot guy gardner 
scheduled practice landing approaches on a runway here in a jet 
plane equipped to handle like a shuttle 
the three mission specialists mike mullane jerry ross and 
william shepherd planned to rehearse driving a tanklike vehicle 
the astronauts would use in case they had to make an emergency 
escape from a launch pad problem 
on sunday the crew planned to rehearse other emergency 
procedures at the launch pad and on monday they will board atlantis 
cabin for the final two hours of a countdown rehearsal

the trial of a woman who tried to 
kill her comatose son has drawn widespread interest in this nation 
which has a tolerant attitude toward mercy killing 
on thursday a prosecutor in this western dutch city recommended 
a suspended oneyear prison term against the woman who was 
convicted of trying to cut the carotid artery of her 20yearold 
son patrick in february 
her son has been in a coma for 16 years 
the defendant was only identified as 44yearold philippine g in 
line with dutch judicial practice 
although euthanasia is formally banned by netherlands law an 
estimated 5000 cases occur annually according to figures provided 
by the royal medical association 
in recent years dutch courts have meted out token sentences to 
doctors who performed acts of euthanasia on terminally ill patients 
as long as the cases met unofficial guidelines 
under those guidelines euthanasia is allowed at the explicit 
request of a patient if a terminal illness causes unbearable 
suffering 
premier ruud lubbers centerright government is preparing 
legislation that will allow euthanasia by medical professionals 
under certain circumstances a parliamentary debate on the issue is 
expected next year 
in the case in dordrecht the woman acknowledged she attempted to 
end her sons life according to court documents 
his suffering had become intolerable the woman was quoted as 
saying 
she told the court that she did not want to involve a doctor 
because i wanted to bear the responsibility for this act alone 
patrick has been in a nursing home since he fell through the ice 
of a pond in 1971 and was pulled from the water unconscious three 
days after the accident his doctors removed him from a respirator 
because they detected no brain activity however patrick continued 
to breathe 
on feb 5 philippine g went to the nursing home with a razor 
blade intending to kill her son she told the court 
i went to his room held his hand and told him that i had to 
hurt him a little bit she was quoted as saying 
but she failed to locate her sons carotid artery and only 
inflicted minor wounds before a nurse found her the court documents 
said 
a ruling on the sentence is expected within two weeks

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address by house speaker jim wright 
of texas 
the campaign is behind us and the season of thanksgiving and 
christmas lies ahead in the process which has served us so well for 
two hundred years the american people have chosen a new president 
and a new congress 
first of all let me offer my sincere congratulations to 
presidentelect george bush he will assume enormous 
responsibilities for us and he deserves to have the prayers and the 
help of us all 
there is a venerable and generous tradition in american politics 
that after the clash of the campaign both sides accept the verdict 
cheerfully and join hands to pursue the goals of peace and 
prosperity for which all americans yearn 
let me express my thanks to the american people for the vote of 
confidence by which they returned a strong democratic congress with 
increased majorities in both house and senate 
this is the first time in eighty years since l908 that the 
american people have elected a president of one party while 
enlarging the majority for the other party in both house and senate 
and in the governors offices throughout the country 
and so if there is any clear mandate perhaps the american 
people are telling both parties both president and congress to 
work together to achieve those things that so desperately need to be 
done for our whole country 
there are areas in which we have substantial agreement mr bush 
spoke during the campaign of a kinder gentler nation we would like 
very much to help him achieve that goal i hope we can develop a 
harmonious working relationship and as speaker of the house i 
pledge my best efforts toward that end 
it was refreshing to hear mr bush pledge to become an education 
president and to the extent that he wishes to follow through on 
that pledge i assure him that congress will enthusiastically help 
to the end that america may be number one again in education and 
higher education may be placed within the financial reach of all of 
our young people 
mr bush has also promised to do more to clean up our living 
environment we know that this pledge includes not just boston 
harbor but all the other polluted harbors and rivers and lakes that 
threaten the public health and as he pursues that goal i promise 
that mr bush will find strong bipartisan support in congress 
the presidentelect said several weeks ago that he favors raising 
the minimum wage and that was good news for millions of lowincome 
americans who earn the bare minimum which has not increased in 
almost eight years congress will help him do that 
the congress also looks forward to working with the bush 
administration to improve the quality and availability of safe and 
wholesome day care facilities for working mothers to which he has 
expressed personal commitment these will make a fine start towards 
that kinder gentler nation 
and so for today lets lay aside those things that have divided 
us and think instead upon those bigger things that unite us in 
these areas on which we already agree lets come together quickly 
and get the job done in those areas where we may disagree let us 
start the opening the doors of our minds to search for common ground 
centuries ago an ancient greek named aristophanes walked among 
the ruins of the greek temple devastated by the peloponnesian wars 
he ordered this prayer from the murmur and subtlety of suspicion 
with which we vex one another give us rest make a new beginning 
mingle again the kindred nations in the alchemy of love and with 
some finer essence of forbearance temper our minds 
those are good words for us today after the close of the 100th 
congress and as together working within this constitutional system 
we embark upon our third century of american government

president reagan said saturday the peaceful 
transition of power in america is cause for us to wonder at our 
freedom and to be grateful to veterans of the nations wars 
in the 10 weeks before jan 20 1989 we the people can take 
pride in just how strong our political system really is reagan 
said in his weekly radio address delivered from camp david 
we take it for granted sometimes but i couldnt help thinking 
on tuesday night how inspiring it is that we americans can choose 
our leader without fear of violence the president said 
we have made our choice and life goes on we dont even need 
to give it a second thought but when we do i think its cause for 
us to wonder at our freedom 
mixing reflections on the transition with commemoration of his 
last veterans day weekend as president reagan said we continue 
to enjoy our freedom because of those brave americans who have 
legitimately taken up arms in the service of their country 
reagan also repeated a note he has sounded often as he spoke on 
behalf of vice president bushs successful campaign for the 
presidency saying that if there is one change george bush and i 
made that touches me most profoundly it would probably be this once 
again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their 
country 
the president did not elaborate on the remark but has often 
boasted that his administration rebuilt american military might 
after a period of neglect reagan took office in 1981 succeeding 
democrat jimmy carter 
reagan also took issue with some critics who say that bush does 
not have a strong mandate because issues were not spelled out 
clearly enough during the campaign 
george bush has gotten his mandate from the american people a 
mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and 
prosperity to the american people to bring hope and opportunity to 
all americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the 
world the president said 
in the democrats weekly broadcast response house speaker jim 
wright extended congratulations to bush and thanked voters for 
increasing the democratic majorities in the house and senate 
he noted it was the first time since 1908 that americans have 
elected a president of one party and at the same time increased the 
majority for the other party in the house senate and governors 
offices across the country 
and so if there is any clear mandate perhaps the american 
people are telling both parties both president and congress to 
work together to achieve those things that so desperately need to be 
done for our whole country he said 
wright dtexas said democrats would like to help him achieve 
his goal of making america a kinder gentler nation 
the speaker said bush will find bipartisan support in congress on 
several of his campaign promises he mentioned specifically bushs 
pledges to become an education president to clean up the 
environment raise the minimum wage and improve the quality and 
availability of daycare facilities 
these will make a fine start toward that kinder gentler 
nation wright said

the 44 billion super collider atom 
smasher will be the latest and maybe the last link in a chain of 
probes of natures basic secrets that began with window glass and 
sealing wax at the university of california 58 years ago 
when asked what good is such a machine some physicists like to 
respond with the answer of michael faraday who discovered the basic 
laws of electricity to queen victoria when she asked for an 
explanation of his experiments 
madam of what use is a newborn baby 
the collider will smash beams of protons into each other at a 
collision energy of 40 trillion electron volts 20 times what is now 
possible at the most powerful existing machine the 
fourmilesaround tevatron at the fermi national laboratory near 
chicago the energy department announced last week it would like to 
put the installation at waxahachie texas near dallas 
the point of the collisions is to see what new particles are 
produced by this extreme energy in such a small space that it will 
match the energy density of the postulated big bang creation of 
the universe some 20 billion years ago 
the appearance of the right particles will tell scientists 
whether their latest theories on the origin of the universe are on 
track 
there are no other ways to test these theories cosmic rays might 
create the target particles but they are so rare that scientists 
might have to wait years for the right event and then years for 
another 
the colliders beam current will be 2 amperes at peaks not 
particularly high for a modern accelerator but so tightly focused 
that the collisions should provide 100 to 1000 times more particles 
to investigate than the best of todays machines 
the protons moving close to the speed of light are bent in 
nearly circular paths in vacuum pipes by 10000 extremely strong 
magnets with fields 66000 times as strong as the earths magnetic 
field 
with weaker magnets the collider would have to be far bigger 
100 miles around 
the use of magnets is the innovation of ernest o lawrence at the 
university of california 
lawrence adapted an idea of a norwegian physicist rolf wideroe 
who used an electric field to accelerate ions through a tube then 
reversed the field to accelerate the ions again to their point of 
origin 
straightline accelerators are still used stanford university 
is bringing a new one on line 
but lawrence wanted to give his ions many accelerations to reach 
extremely high energies and realized the way to do it was to use a 
magnetic field to bend the ion path 180 degrees between applications 
of an electric field with each kick from the electric field the 
ion moved to a larger semicircular path up to the limits of the 
size of the vacuum container used 
in his 1986 history of 20thcentury particle physics inward 
bound rockefeller university physicist abraham pais described 
lawrences first machine assembled by a graduate student in the 
spring of 1930 the vacuum chamber made at first of pieces of 
window pane scraps of brass and an overcoat of wax fitted between 
the 4inchdiameter poles of a spectroscopists magnet 
from then on machines continually increased in energy and new 
techniques were developed to focus the beams one major change was 
the introduction of electromagnets and fixed circular paths with 
the magnetic field growing as the particle accelerated to confine 
the particle to the chosen path 
the tevatron near chicago and a smaller machine at michigan state 
university introduced a major advance the use of superconductors to 
power the electromagnets this means the cables have no electrical 
resistance and no power is wasted heating the magnets 
the tevatron illustrates the long gestation of modern 
instruments construction of a 200 billion electron volt accelerator 
was recommended by an advisory panel in 1963 in 1966 after much 
competition a committee of the national academy of sciences 
recommended the illinois site 
there have been reports that president johnson used the 
accelerator in political trading with sen everett dirksen rill 
competition for the super collider was just as intense 25 
states proposed 35 sites and losing states have charged that the 
selection of texas was motivated by politics the desire to please 
the new presidentelect and to enlist powerful texans in congress to 
win the appropriations necessary 
it took until 1972 nine years after the first recommendation to 
win funds from congress and build the illinois machine which has 
been upgraded since congress still hasnt appropriated construction 
funds for the super collider 
the texas collider was recommended by a committee of physicists 
in 1983 only after an agonizing decision to abandon several other 
funding requests for particle accelerators wrote three of its 
designers david jackson murray tigner and stanley wojcicki 
it was in the same year that the world was shown again what 
modern accelerators do the geneva switzerland machine operated by 
a consortium of european nations found the wparticle the 
intermediate vector boson predicted by a theory published in 
1967 
in an illustration of the international complexity of modern 
science the discovery was made by a team led by carlo rubbia an 
italian who is professor of physics at harvard university in 
cambridge mass and now director of the geneva installation 
keeping ahead of the europeans is what drives us physicists 
and their government patrons energy secretary john herrington in 
announcing the choice of texas said most of the leadership in 
highenergy physics is headed for europe we need to keep those 
people in the united states 
after the 1983 recommendation the energy department commissioned 
a collider design completed in 1986 basically it scales up the 
tevatron and involves no new technology 
the reagan administration didnt decide to try to build the super 
collider until january 1987 setting off the scramble among states 
to land an economic plum 3500 or more construction jobs a 
permanent staff of 3000 and a 270 million annual operating budget

two soviet cosmonauts broke a 326day record for 
endurance in space saturday and the official news agency tass 
announced that a second try to launch the soviet space shuttle will 
take place tuesday 
the first attempt to launch the shuttle buran on oct 29 ended 
51 seconds before scheduled liftoff when a piece of equipment on 
the launch pad failed to move away from the unmanned craft 
tass said the two cosmonauts on the space station mir flight 
commander vladimir titov 41 and engineer musa manarov 37 broke 
last years record established by colleague yuri romanenko 
titov and manarov were reported healthy with only small changes 
in their weight and muscle measurements 
scientists worry about atrophy when humans spend long periods in 
zero gravity in space using just a fraction of their strength 
the buran space shuttle is due to lift off at 6 am tuesday 10 
pm est monday if the unmanned double orbit is successful 
officials will begin planning routine flights with a crew tass said 
however soviet authorities said the buran and its sister ships 
will shoot off into space no more than two to four times a year 
tass did not clarify whether that meant each shuttle would fly 
only four times a year or whether the entire fleet would make just 
four flights a year 
alexander i dunaev director of the soviet commercial space 
agency glavkosmos said several shuttles are under construction 
the soviets have not said how many shuttles they plan to build 
but they will continue to use simpler less expensive rockets to put 
satellites into orbit and save the shuttles for repair and hauling 
cargo to the mir space station 
buran which means snowstorm in russian will circle the 
earth twice on its first flight and land at a specially constructed 
runway back at the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet kazakhstan in 
central asia 
the cause of the delay has now been eliminated and the energia 
booster rocket system with the buran orbiter is undergoing 
prelaunch preparations tass reported 
the two cosmonauts on the space station mir titov and manarov 
will get some company for their last month in orbit when two soviet 
colleagues and a frenchman join them nov 26 tass said on dec 21 
titov and manarov will end their year in space by flying home with 
the french cosmonaut leaving their two soviet colleagues in space 
titov has lost 44 pounds in space and manarov gained 33 
pounds tass said 
the us record for the longest manned mission is 84 days set in 
1973 by astronauts gerald carr edward gibson and william pogue 
aboard space station skylab

lead levels in soil at a skagway ore 
terminal are up to twice as high as originally reported and 
environmentalists have accused state officials of withholding 
details about toxic contamination for years 
a state environmental official on friday confirmed that he wrote 
a memo on nov 1 saying concentrations approached 60000 parts per 
million or 1200 times normal levels rather than the 28000 parts 
per million announced by the terminal operator nov 4 
dozens of residents including most of the children and pregnant 
women in the southeast alaska town gave blood and urine samples 
last week at the states request officials say the tests will 
confirm whether the high lead levels pose a health threat to the 
towns 790 residents 
the situation is certainly serious as the numbers are very 
high dick stokes southeast regional supervisor for the state 
department of environmental conservation wrote in the nov 1 memo 
to department commissioner dennis kelso the anxiety level in 
skagway will also be high 
concentrations of lead in soil samples far exceed levels at 
which the epa has recommended or taken action in the past stokes 
wrote for areas where children are exposed such a level for lead 
is 5001000 parts per million 
levels of other metals at the terminal including arsenic 
cadmium and mercury also exceed epa action levels the memo 
says 
at a news conference nov 4 an environmental consultant hired by 
terminal operator bowhead equipment co said preliminary tests 
showed soil levels up to 28000 parts per million more than 560 
times the level naturally found in skagways soil stokes was at the 
conference did not dispute the companys numbers 
i do remember at one time in the press conference being nervous 
that you reporters were not getting the high figure for lead from 
the company stokes said although he denied any attempt to 
supress the information and noted that his memo was part of the 
public record 
a representative of the sierra club charged friday that state 
officials had withheld information on the extent of pollution in 
skagway for years 
the air waters streets even kids sandboxes are contaminated 
with hazardous waste at levels hundreds of times above that 
known to place people at risk said carl reller of the 
environmental groups juneau chapter essential information is 
being withheld even today by both state officials and private 
companies 
stokes called that conclusion scientifically irresponsible 
i certainly dont think weve downplayed it he said the 
intent has been to give out responsible numbers 
we certainly didnt want to blast out the worst possible 
picture he said we didnt want any panic in skagway that was 
for sure 
officials also are uncertain how easily lead sulfide in soil is 
absorbed by humans stokes said most cleanups have involved sites 
such as smelters contaminated by processed lead 
the soil tests were conducted by bowhead after the epa ordered 
the operator last summer to stop the spread of lead and zinc ore 
concentrate at the site 
for 20 years the powdery concentrate has been transported 
through town to the shipping terminal at skagway harbor since the 
early 1980s officials have known that lead sulfide polluted the 
harbor skagway is about 90 miles north of juneau 
terminal workers swept the ore off the dock for years the gusty 
winds of the taiya river valley also spread the ore but officials 
did not consider the threat of lead in the soil until recently 
a november 1985 state memo noted that the bottom sediments in 
the skagway harbor have been found to be among the most toxic in the 
world

israel closed the occupied territories confined 
680000 residents to their homes cut telephone lines and made 
arrests saturday in an attempt to prevent protests during a major 
meeting of palestinian leaders 
at least two arabs were shot and wounded in the gaza strip 
hospital officials said 
the palestine national council the plos parliament in exile 
was expected to declare an independent palestinian state in the west 
bank and gaza strip during a fourday meeting that convened saturday 
in algeria 
underground palestinian leaders in the occupied territories 
called for increased protests during the meeting 
troops entered dozens of villages and towns during the night and 
arrested a number of suspected activists said an army spokesman 
speaking on condition of anonymity he did not say how many arrests 
were made 
nine israeliarab citizens suspected of belonging to a plo 
guerrilla cell that threatened arab collaborators with israel were 
arrested army radio said 
soldiers armed with tear gas grenade launchers and rifles kept a 
tight check on the movements of arabs in the alleys of east 
jerusalem and the west bank towns of bethlehem and ramallah 
the army turned back palestinian cars bound for jerusalem and 
police used tear gas to break up a protest outside the old city 
walls said police spokesman rafi levy at least one arab was 
detained 
jerusalem closed all privatelyrun arab schools for four days so 
they would not turn into focal points of unrest said a city 
official who demanded anonymity west bank schools have been closed 
for almost a year 
information from the occupied areas was limited because the army 
barred reporters from entering and disconnected many telephone lines 
in bethlehem troops checked residents israeliissued identity 
papers and ordered some palestinians to return to their homes 
according to an arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a military helicopter and a small airplane circled above the 
biblical city while soldiers on the ground seized cans of spray 
paint from stores and covered propalestinian slogans scrawled on 
walls the reporter said 
several stonethrowing clashes with youths were reported in the 
west bank city of nablus army radio said 
we are keeping foot and mobile patrols continuously moving to 
prevent any form of gathering whatsoever said a police officer in 
east jerusalem who requested anonymity 
in east jerusalem and the west bank soldiers distributed 
leaflets written in arabic in which the army appealed to residents 
to maintain order said another arab reporter who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
dont deceive yourselves that the palestine national council 
resolutions in algeria have any weight in solving the regional 
conflict the leaflets said they are only ink on paper we 
ask you not to incite emotions 
the gazas 650000 residents were confined to their homes all day 
saturday and another 30000 residents of four west bank towns and a 
refugee camp were under curfew despite the restrictions gaza 
youths took to the streets to set tires aflame and block roads said 
an arab reporter there 
also in gaza a 20yearold man from the jabalia refugee camp was 
shot in the hand and a 30yearold man from the sabra camp was shot 
in the shoulder hospital officials said 
nablus the west banks largest city with 100000 residents was 
declared a closed military area meaning no one could leave or enter 
the city limits said the army spokesman 
today was quiet thats a fact the army spokesman said

calling it a propaganda ploy aimed at western hemisphere diplomats 
gathered here 
the armed forces have a constitutional mission to carry out

to suspend operations col rene emilio ponce told reporters 
during a breakfast meeting 
marxistled guerrillas who have been at war with the usbacked 
government for nine years said friday they would halt all but 
defense operations during the organization of american states 
general assembly 
they said their truce would run from sunday night through friday 
the final day of the assembly foreign ministers and top diplomats 
from 31 nations are in san salvador for the meeting

about 10 miles northwest of the capital ponce said he had the rebel 
documents with him but he refused to show them to journalists 
this mobilization is not distinct from the overall guerrilla 
strategy but one of its avenues he said it is intended to 
demonstrate to the ministers that they the guerrillas enjoy a 
popular support that in reality they do not have 
the rebels say the centrist democratically elected 
administration of president jose napoleon duarte is a facade for a 
repressive militarydominated government they demand formation of 
what they call a government of broad popular participation which 
would include revolutionaries

jewish fundamentalists have broken out 
of their tightknit neighborhoods and selfimposed isolation in a 
quest for political power that has alarmed a largely secular israel 
in the early years of the jewish state members of the 
ultraorthodox movements of judaism concentrated on rebuilding 
communities nearly wiped out by the holocaust 
the task has been largely accomplished and many fundamentalists 
have now become involved in politics 
by participating in the political process these parties are 
modernizing they are breaking out of the ghetto said shmuel 
sandler professor at the religious bar ilan university near tel 
aviv they want a piece of the national pie 
the orthodox hope that gaining seats in the knesset or 
parliament and the cabinet will help them put religion back into 
the daily life of israel where about 75 percent of the 35 million 
jews are nonreligious 
in the nov 1 elections four religious parties the torah flag 
the shas the agudat israel and the national religious party 
captured 15 percent of the 22 million votes and 18 pivotal seats in 
the knesset 
the four parties hold the balance of power between the leftwing 
labor party which won 39 seats and the rightwing likud bloc 
which won 40 seats 
their new political spirit is illustrated by the habad hasidim 
the power behind the agudat israel party which has built a strong 
missionary army to recruit nonreligious jews 
we share our judaism with all jews said habad spokesman 
moshe birke 
birke underlines habads acceptance of the outside world by 
offering his guests cans of kosher budweiser beer made in israel 
under rabbinical supervision 
habad followers hand out candles to soldiers in the field on the 
sabbath visit families at home and urge jewish students in bus 
stations to wrap their arms in phylacteries traditional prayer 
straps and worship 
kfar habad 12 miles inland from the pubs and nonkosher 
restaurants of secular tel aviv is a strict orthodox village with 
450 families or about 2700 people one of five such communities 
in israel 
habad which claims a halfmillion supporters throughout the 
world has built a reputation for charitable acts it takes in and 
gives vocational training to children from broken homes sponsors 
community centers in poor neighborhoods and has built 25 synagogues 
in jerusalem alone 
hundreds of habad followers were flown in from the united states 
to help with the election campaign 
the focus of the habad movement is the lubavitcher rabbi menachem 
mendel schneerson 86 who was born in russia and lives in brooklyn 
he is revered as a visionary with nearmiraculous powers 
schneersons followers in kfar habad have built a replica of the 
rabbis threestory new york headquarters that is so exact the red 
bricks have been artificially weathered to match those on the 
original building 
rabbi schneersons orders propelled habad into politics for the 
first time squadrons of volunteers canvassed neighborhoods 
promising the new york rabbis personal blessings in exchange for 
votes 
we got 102000 votes birke noted that translated into five 
knesset seats for the ultraorthodox agudat israel which got only 
two seats in the last election in 1984 
all the religious parties believe god gave the jewish people the 
land of israel including the west bank and gaza strip which israel 
occupied in 1967 
the most dovish is torah flag which supports giving up land if 
it means saving lives 
to give back land or not give back land is not relevant we 
need to strengthen the moral fiber of israel said moshe peretz 
spokesman for the sixseat shas party or torah guardians he said 
the government should focus on problems such as drug abuse and 
housing 
the chief demand of orthodox parties is to amend the law of 
return which provides automatic citizenship to any jew current law 
defines a jew as someone born of a jewish mother or converted to 
judaism 
the orthodox demand that conversions be approved by their branch 
of judaism rather than the less traditional conservative or reform 
movements 
the religious parties have presented a long list of other demands 
that also would affect life in israel for nonreligious jews 
the jewish sabbath should be officially recognized as the 
nations day of rest city councils should have the power to close 
public places such as pubs restaurants and soccer stadiums 
kosher food should be served in all public restaurants 
eliminating pork which is banned under orthodox religious laws 
all schools should be assigned a rabbi 
laws should be tightened on autopsies archaeological digs and 
christian missionary activity orthodox laws ban autopsies 
judges in rabbical courts which oversee marriage and divorce 
should get the same salaries as civil court counterparts and their 
rulings should be exempt from supreme court review

the water along seven miles of ocean beaches 
closed by a sewage spill was declared safe for swimming saturday 
but health officials kept it offlimits at least through the weekend 
as a precaution 
the county department of health still wanted to test bacteria 
levels in a creek that feeds the ocean and check a metal cap placed 
over the outlet that spewed sewage for at least three days said 
health spokesman jack petralia 
we want to play it safe for at least another day he said 
authorities have been unable to say exactly how much sewage 
spilled but described it as a major flow it caused bacteria levels 
in the surf near the citys biggest recreational habor marina del 
rey to rise to more than double the levels considered safe for 
swimming city biologist john dorsey said 
the discharge apparently was caused by the failure of a 30inch 
cap welded on an overflow sewer line about 15 miles inland 
according to del biagi director of the city bureau of sanitation 
biagi said he had ordered an inspection of 30 similar caps 
throughout the city 
hundreds of youngsters who had veterans day off from school 
headed for the sundrenched beaches friday but lifeguards said most 
heeded warnings to stay out of the contaminated stretch

a man accused of being the center city 
stalker has been convicted of robbery assault and attempted rape 
in 10 attacks on women in downtown office buildings 
reynard gregory 36 was found guilty friday by jurors who 
deliberated 10 to 12 hours after hearing 70 witnesses and being 
shown more than 100 pieces of evidence 
one of the stalkers victims wept when the verdict was read 
i dont think ill ever forget this the woman told the 
philadelphia inquirer which did not use her name i thought that 
id be a lot happier i really dont feel that good i feel sad 
for three months the socalled stalker terrorized women who 
lived or worked downtown he hid in stairwells and hallways in 
office buildings within six blocks of city hall 
he used tricks or force to get young victims into outoftheway 
locations where he would rob or sexually assault them 
the defense contended that police arrested the wrong man because 
officers were pressured to wrap up the case attorneys leaned 
heavily on conflicting descriptions of the attacker from the 10 
victims 
defense attorney jerry kristal told the jury that gregory was the 
victim of a police conspiracy carried out by three bad cops who 
were given a mission to plant a seed that bore poisoned fruit 
prosecutor christopher rooney characterized gregory as a 
compulsive sexual deviate 
gregory was charged in may with 45 counts of robbery assault and 
sexual violence in the 10 attacks between january and march 
he faces a prison sentence of between 100 and 200 years rooney 
said in addition he could be forced to serve the 12 years 
remaining on an earlier conviction for stabbing a man to death on a 
bus gregory was paroled on that conviction after serving 7 years 
everybody can be assured that this guy will never get out of 
jail to bother anybody again the prosecutor said

pope john paul ii on saturday rebuked 
catholics who say they are following their own conscience in using 
artificial birth control 
the pontiff also criticized theologians who have dissented from 
the roman catholic churchs teaching on contraceptives saying they 
make void the cross of christ 
when paul vi defined the contraceptive act as intrinsically 
illicit he meant that the moral norm does not admit exceptions no 
personal or social circumstance has ever been able is able or will 
ever be able in itself to ordain such an act the pope told 300 
theologians from 34 nations at a conference on birth control 
john paul said that in the two decades since pope paul vi issued 
humanae vitae the encyclical condemning artificial birth 
control many people have accepted the idea that their conscience 
established moral principles 
in this way there has been a radical breakdown in the bond of 
obedience to the holy will of the creator which was the basis of 
human dignity the pope told the conference which was called to 
discuss moral theology on the 20th anniversary of humanae vitae 
john paul said that whoever differed with church teaching because 
of his or her own conscience rejected the catholic concepts of moral 
conscience and magisterium or the churchs authority 
you cant say that a member of the faithful has carried out a 
diligent investigation of the truth if he doesnt take into account 
what the magisterium teaches if availing himself of any other 
source of knowledge he makes himself the judge if in doubt he 
follows his own opinion or that of theologians instead of the 
teaching of the church the pope said 
many catholics especially in developed countries such as the 
united states have ignored church teaching on contraception us 
roman catholic bishops suggested in a draft letter released this 
year that the church be more receptive toward women who used 
artificial birth control

two americans who illegally entered laos 
in search of american prisoners of war were freed saturday after 
their supporters paid 1500 and canceled a protest at the laotian 
embassy in washington 
donna long and james copp both of north carolina arrived in 
bangkok on a flight from vientiane the laotian capital they 
appeared exhausted after 41 days of detention 32 of them in 
solitary confinement 
the two entered communist laos to advertise a reward offer for 
the release of us pows from the indochina war 
it was a horrible 41 days but i dont regret it said miss 
long who lost 15 pounds the only hope that our men in laos have 
is that someone brings them out she said a sternlooking police 
colonel told them that while they were being freed any others who 
entered laos illegally would not be 
they would stay forever forever she quoted the colonel as 
saying 
miss long a 45yearold writer from jacksonville nc and 
copp a 44yearold schoolteacher from hampstead nc were taken 
into custody oct 3 
they had sailed across the mekong river boundary between thailand 
and laos entered a laotian village and distributed leaflets 
advertising a 24 million reward for the return of any american war 
prisoner the reward has been pledged by 21 republican congressmen 
and some private citizens 
laos has denied holding prisoners from the war from which us 
forces withdrew in 1973 washington has criticized miss long and 
copp saying what they did jeopardized official efforts to account 
for 547 americans listed as missing in action in laos 
when an angry policeman saw miss long and copp in the village 
the two rushed down a hill and a thai who was hired to navigate the 
boat started the engine but the policeman ordered him to cut the 
engine the thai was released quickly 
the americans said they were kept in the village for a day then 
moved to pakse city for a few days stay before being flown to 
vientiane 
upon landing the two were put in a jeep manned by two men with 
machine guns who blindfolded them they were driven into the garage 
of what they later found out was the immigration building a 
fiveminute walk from the us embassy 
in the garage they feared the worst 
it got really dark said miss long then everybody got out 
of the jeep and the only people still in the jeep were us and the 
two people with the guns behind us i thought this was it the big 
one 
i thought we would be shot in the back of the head copp said 
instead they were taken up to their separate rooms to begin their 
solitary confinement in pakse the two had to sign statements that 
they had intruded into laos and caused problems 
miss long said that in vientiane i was interrogated on 
numerous occasions and they would take that statement and over and 
over again ask the same questions they wanted to know just about 
everything they kept asking me who is your boss and who sent you 
here 
in her last session on oct 29 they asked why do you help to 
try to find criminals american servicemen bombed our houses 
killed our people people who did nothing to them they are 
criminals 
miss long said the police colonel complained people were 
abandoning their work and searching for the american servicemen in 
order to collect the reward he said people were crossing the river 
into thailand to find out more about the reward 
miss long said she spent her time exercising singing and making 
things including a deck of cards from cigarette packs to play 
solitaire 
copp said a plant grew in the corner of his ratinfested room 
and at one point he did not speak to anyone for two weeks 
he said his trip into laos wasnt a mistake im more convinced 
than ever that there are prisoners of war there 
donald stader a state department official said in washington on 
friday that laotian authorities agreed to release the pair in return 
for 1500 in administrative costs 
another condition imposed by laos he said was that a us 
veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the laotian 
embassy in washington friday to protest the detention 
the national steering committee for american vietnam war veterans 
canceled the protest and gave the 1500 fee to stader

afghan guerrillas claimed saturday 
they cut the strategic salang highway between the capital kabul 
and the soviet union in an offensive that killed 20 soviet soldiers 
radio moscow reported that the sovietbacked afghan army had 
retaken another highway a 72mile route from kabul eastward toward 
the pakistani border 
the government army has regained control of the kabuljalalabad 
highway the radio said adding that 1358 rebels were killed in 
fighting in the provinces of nangarhar paktia helmand and badghis 
the claims could not be confirmed independently 
the jamiateislami rebel group claimed the salang highway was 
closed in the pakistani frontier city of peshawar jamiat spokesman 
mohammed schweib said five guerrillas were killed in the fighting 
the highway is the main route by which soviet soldiers were 
leaving afghanistan under an accord calling for the withdrawal of 
soviet troops 
schweib said moslem guerrillas staged repeated attacks along the 
240mile highway which runs from kabul to the soviet border town of 
termez 
schweib said 20 soviets were killed and 22 tanks destroyed in one 
attack nov 6 on a convoy near the town of rabatak in the northern 
province of baghlan 90 miles south of the soviet border 
schweib said the attacks on the salang highway in northern 
samangan baghlan and parwan provinces have destroyed about 140 
sovietafghan military vehicles including tanks armored personnel 
carriers and trucks 
he did not elaborate on casualty figures 
last week jamiat leader burhanuddin rabbani discussed the salang 
offensive with reporters in washington after meeting with president 
reagan and secretary of state george p shultz 
until the salang offensive rebels in the area had been letting 
withdrawing soviet troops leave unimpeded but guerrilla leaders 
said the introduction early this month of soviet surfacetosurface 
missiles and mig27 jets is tantamount to a renewed soviet invasion 
an accord signed in april provided for the withdrawal of soviet 
troops and half the force left by aug 15 
the timetable calls for completion of the withdrawal by feb 15 
but the soviet union said nov 4 it had suspended the withdrawal 
charging that the accord was being broken by the continued arming of 
the insurgency by pakistan and the united states the soviets said 
the temporary suspension did not consititute a breach of the accord 
in other developments governmentcontrolled radio kabul said 
saturday that 10 people were killed in attacks on two cities 
the broadcast monitored in islamabad said one person was killed 
and another injured when a bomb exploded saturday in kabul 
the radio said the device was planted by criminals 
presumably moslem insurgents who have been fighting the communist 
government for 10 years 
the broadcast said eight people were killed and 20 injured during 
the past two days when surfacetosurface rockets hit residential 
areas in charikar 30 miles north of kabul

presidentelect george bush determined 
not to make any news while he is on vacation spent saturday in the 
surf and sun and used his private time to make phone calls and write 
thankyou notes 
bush conferred briefly by telephone with his chief of staff 
craig fuller who is leading the transition team that will put 
together the bush administration said spokesman steve hart 
fuller and bush campaign adviser robert teeter are working on 
potential cabinet nominations and other possible administration 
appointments 
the only information being disseminated officially by the bush 
staff on saturday dealt with the presidentelects recreation 
schedule and his letters and calls of thanks to people who had 
helped in the campaign or congratulated him on winning the election 
hart was asked during a briefing saturday what bush had to say 
about the dramatic drop in the stock market since the election and 
the dollars plunge to a 40year low against the japanese yen 
analysts said the decline reflected worries about bushs ability to 
deal with the federal budget deficit 
we wont have anything to say about that hart replied 
pressed further hart said hes on vacation right now and im 
sure hes aware of it and has his own thoughts on it but its not 
something well be sharing with you 
instead hart told about how bush had surffished twice that day 
for whiting pompano and barracuda 
he didnt catch anything hart noted a fact verified at a 
distance by reporters and photographers who staked out the beach 
behind the oceanfront home of bushs multimillionaire friend william 
stamps farish iii 
attired in blue shorts a red longsleeved shirt and blue cap 
bush went into the balmy waters up to his waist in an effort to land 
a fish while secret service agents kept an eye on the beach 
bushs wife barbara wearing white slacks and a blue striped 
top came out to watch along with farishs wife sarah and 
22yearold daughter laura 
bush planned an afternoon nap and a game of golf 
hart said the presidentelect was settling into a pattern for the 
fourday vacation of recreation time in the afternoon and telephone 
calls and writing in the morning 
he said bush telephoned several people saturday morning to thank 
them for their help in his campaign or for their congratulatory 
calls and telegrams among them were comedian bob hope california 
gov george deukmejian new mexico gov garrey carruthers former 
sen barry goldwater of arizona indiana gov robert orr alabama 
gov guy hunt and sen orrin hatch of utah 
hart said bush had decided not to dine out while staying in this 
exclusive palm treedotted community because of the security 
measures that would be required 
the idea is to keep the disruptiveness of this as little as 
possible hart said

as far as harvey rosenfield is 
concerned david had it easy against goliath at least david had a 
sling and five stones 
rosenfield started with only a few dollars and a cause in a fight 
against the california insurance industry and ended up a giant 
slayer with his proposition 103 ballot initiative to roll back 
insurance rates more than 20 percent 
the ralph nader protege said the initiatives victory in 
tuesdays election amounted to a voter revolt with the message that 
consumers will no longer tolerate high insurance rates and 
ineffective politicians 
this proves that you can fight city hall and win he said in 
his apartment saturday weve proven that word of mouth and a 
grassroots campaign is far more powerful than all the slick 
30second tv ads that money can buy 
the insurance industry which watched its 70 million campaign go 
down the drain immediately took its battle to the courts amid 
threats to pull out of california and predictions of economic doom 
the state supreme court temporarily froze the rate rollbacks for 
motorists businesses homeowners and municipalities until it can 
decide if the measure is constitutional 
the prospect of another long and costly battle to implement 
proposition 103 left rosenfield with little time to celebrate but 
he said hes confident that the movement he launched in 1986 will be 
victorious in the end 
just like proposition 13 the taxpayer rebellion that started 
in california and spread through the nation proposition 103 the 
voter revolt to cut insurance rates will sweep the united states 
like a prairie wildfire he said 
rosenfield 36 announced the drive to put proposition 103 on the 
ballot in november 1986 after an unsuccessful attempt to push 
insurance reform through the legislature 
rosenfield has been a staff attorney for naders public citizen 
congress watch in washington dc and director of the california 
public interest research group 
if hes lucky hell make about 20000 this year a fraction of 
what he figures individual classmates at georgetowns law school 
class of 1979 are making but he said at least im having fun 
and doing something good i wonder if they can say that 
his nader connection proved crucial to the campaign for 
proposition 103 one of five complicated insurance measures crowding 
the longest and perhaps most confusing ballot in california history 
nader vigorously campaigned for proposition 103 giving it 
credibility among many voters and drawing the kind of publicity that 
the campaign could not buy with its 23 million budget rosenfield 
said 
people were so interested in the demand for insurance reform 
that they were looking for the right measure said rosenfield 
people were asking who is behind these things thats what the 
whole thing came down to theres no question that ralph naders 
integrity and commitment to consumers is so widely known and 
universally share that voters trusted him 
the five measures together with 24 other propositions triggered 
more than 130 million in campaign spending about 70 million of it 
by insurance companies it was the most expensive campaign in the 
country outside of a presidential race 
two big insurance companies allstate insurance and mercury 
casualty said they would stop selling new liability policies in 
california other companies said they might be forced to follow suit 
but by friday allstate and mercury reversed themselves and took 
a waitandsee stand 
two state senators threatened to press for multimilliondollar 
penalties if companies flee the state 
in the meantime rosenfield and his supporters at voter revolt to 
cut insurance rates plan their next moves 
voter revolt will stay around and try to raise money to enforce 
proposition 103 fight the legal attack in court and make sure its 
enforced fairly by the insurance commissioner he said were 
still going

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee accused the reagan administration on saturday of timing 
foreclosure warnings to hit about 90000 farms just after the 
election 
however the head of the agriculture department agency involved 
denied the charge and said the regulations involved were too complex 
to have been completed earlier 
the notices will tell delinquent borrowers from the farmers home 
administration that they are seriously behind in their payments 
should start considering their options and tell fmha within 45 days 
what they want to do the notices will lay out the options farmers 
may pursue 
those options under 1987 legislation signed by president reagan 
early in 1988 permit the fmha under some circumstances to write 
down some debts or to grant new terms the legislation required a 
major reorganization of fmha programs including the notices to 
delinquent borrowers 
giving the administration the benefit of every doubt the 
notices could have gone out by labor day said sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee 
draft regulations were published for comment sept 14 to take 
effect nov 14 which is monday fmha officials said in late october 
they expected to begin mailing the notices soon after nov 14 and 
leahy said he tried to bring this out in campaign appearances in 
farm states on behalf of fellow democrats 
theres no question in my mind it was deliberately held off 
so the notices would follow the presidential election but precede 
the return of congress and inauguration of the new president leahy 
said 
but vance l clark head of the fmha said the timing had 
nothing to do with the election 
we had a tremendous job in training field people to make these 
regulations work and we had to scrub the list to make sure it was 
clean clark said 
sometimes congress doesnt realize what it has wrought clark 
said calling it the most complex regulation weve ever had to 
publish 
we tried but we just couldnt publish the regulation sooner 
he said 
the regulation takes up 160 pages in a special section of the 
sept 14 federal register 
fmha estimates it has 88 billion in pastdue loans the agency 
lends to the shakiest of the nations 216 million farmers those 
who cannot get credit through normal commercial channels

marching bands played champagne corks 
popped and residents gleefully speculated what they could get for 
their property when they learned theyd be neighbors of the new 
super collider 
but real estate agents saturday warned that any property value 
increases would be slow in coming 
the thing that we have tried to do is be realistic with our 
sellers said lucille boardman broker associate with merrill 
lynch realty in desoto between waxahachie and dallas we dont 
see any getting rich quick 
energy secretary john herrington announced the selection thursday 
of ellis county south of dallas as the home for the 44 billion 
atom smasher a 53mile tunnel scientists hope will give an 
unprecedented view of the basic structure of matter 
waxahachie a town of small buildings and 18000 residents that 
is seat of primarily agricultural ellis county will be encircled by 
the super collider 
the giant science project is expected to result in 4000 
construction jobs and 3500 permanent jobs the project will take 
eight years to build the energy department hopes to complete it in 
1996 
but deficit reduction pressures will toughen the fight to fund 
the super collider texas congressional leaders warned 
real estate agents in ellis county said that funding battle has 
tempered some of the enthusiasm generated by herringtons 
announcement 
some of the homeowners feel theres going to be an immediate 
appreciation ms boardman said we feel its going to be 
gradual theyve got to get the funding first 
the citys economy is based largely on the regions cotton and 
sorghum crops but hollywood has discovered waxahachie too 
bonnie and clyde tender mercies places in the heart 
true stories and a trip to bountiful have all been shot in 
or near the town 
waxahachie is a tonkawa indian word for buffalo creek 
the county blossomed in the early 1980s but not as much as its 
northern neighbors dallas and tarrant counties two years ago the 
largely rural area felt the blow of the texas recession 
residential values have gone down significantly in the last two 
years said dan batte sales associate with lowry and associates 
in waxahachie raw land and commercial values have been real flat 
weve had almost no sales of raw land near waxahachie for the 
last 18 months to two years 
vera kamerbeek of the local coldwell banker office said many 
property values in the area dropped between 6 percent to 8 percent 
last year but she hopes the prospect of the atom smasher will turn 
that around 
we think texas has already bottomed out and its only a matter 
of how long it will stay at the bottom she said weve even had 
a lot of calls from people out of state 
elmer nooner 73 who has a real estate business in waxahachie 
said there probably will be a lot of land sold soon 
i just kind of think there will be a lot of speculation he 
said people will want to move down from some other states and be 
in on the action and there will be some houses sold 
batte said he had an appointment saturday to show a chicago 
investor some land 
homeowners dont need to increase their prices yet batte 
said the people interested now are interested in raw land as an 
investment 
a typical two to threebedroom home costs about 90000 said 
edwin farrar of the coldwell banker office 
a real estate agent in midlothian a town of 5200 between the 
super collider and dallasfort worth international airport said 
land values near the super collider campus may jump 500 an acre 
once congress approves funding for the project 
but the agent janet calvert of ramsey ramsey and associates 
said large tracts in the long term may jump from a current level of 
about 4000 an acre to 6000 
doris bratcher said she would cooperate with the government if it 
needs her 25 acres on the outskirts of waxahachie but she doesnt 
want to sell to a developer 
it would have to be a lot more than most people could rig up 
before i would sell said mrs bratcher who raises cutting horses 
with her husband 
molly herrera an employee at waxahachies trinity pharmacy said 
not everyone is excited about the super collider 
most of the old timers are not ms herrera said itll 
just be a big mess 
you always have some who dont want them to mess with a little

police have confiscated a home garbage 
disposal unit they say may have been used to dispose of parts of a 
woman they suspect was murdered 
we took out the whole thing disposal and sealed it up said 
homicide detective alvin rusty brown were going to run some 
tests on it and see what we can find 
the appliance was one of several items police took as evidence 
wednesday in their investigation of the possible death of 
32yearold barbara baughman 
police say they have received a tip that ms baughman was 
smothered or drowned in a bathtub last weekend and then dismembered 
police arrested her husband thomas james fisher 41 and charged 
him with murder he remained in jail saturday under 1 million bond 
during the search of the house police said they discovered 
evidence that blood had been leaned up leading them to believe ms 
baughman had been killed there 
were kind of letting the people with the chemistry sets work 
on it brown said there are a number of chemical tests being 
done on this one hopefully some of those tests will lead us to 
some type of conclusion 
earlier in the week police found what they believed were 
scorched fragments of fingers in an alley investigators with the 
bexar county medical examiners office recovered about 25 small 
fragments and were conducting tests to determine if they were pieces 
of human flesh 
officers searched several areas of the city for body parts brown 
said 
there are indications of the body being dumped somewhere 
brown said weve searched several specific areas of town but 
have not found the body 
brown said ms baughman and fisher had lived in the house for 
about eight months 
ms baughman was unemployed brown said her parents robert and 
velma baughman of schertz told police they had not seen her in eight 
years 
police said fisher who records show is a new york native was 
employed as a salesman for a home improvement contractor

the crew aboard the space shuttle challenger which 
exploded 72 seconds into flight may have survived the blast and 
lived the twoandahalf minutes it took the craft to crash into the 
ocean a magazine reported 
tropic the miami heralds sunday magazine quoted anonymous nasa 
investigators who said the seven crew members including 
schoolteacher christa mcauliffe survived the blast and died only 
when the cabin possibly still pressurized slammed into the 
atlantic ocean at 200 mph 
if it had landed softly they could have swam home said one 
of the investigators 
nasa has maintained the astronauts died the instant the 
spacecraft exploded the space agency also has said that if the crew 
cabin had survived the blast intact it would have been ripped apart 
by aerodynamic forces upon its descent 
national aeronautics and space administration officials declined 
to comment when contacted saturday by the associated press after 
advance copies of the magazine became available 
the magazine reported that no evidence was ever found that the 
cabin lost pressure and if it did it did so slowly without the 
sudden catastrophic loss of air that would have knocked the 
astronauts out within seconds 
the astronauts would have remained conscious long enough to catch 
a glimpse of the ocean rushing toward them if the compartment was 
losing pressure slowly tropic reported 
the freefall lasted about twoandahalf minutes 
nasas official report indicated no cause of death could be 
determined from the remains which were found entangled in the 
crushed cabin on the ocean floor nearly six weeks later 
death certificates issued from the johnson space center in 
houston on jan 30 two days after the tragedy certified that the 
astronauts died when the shuttle spacecraft challenger 
exploded 
dr ronald reeves chief assistant to the medical examiner in 
brevard county where cape canaveral and the kennedy space center 
are located told the magazine those certificates are useless 
because of the date and because they were not signed as legally 
required by florida authorities 
reeves says the public may never learn exactly how the astronauts 
died because nasa intentionally kept the remains from florida 
pathologists whose records would be public 
the law doesnt say were allowed to do the autopsies reeves 
said it says we are required to do them 
the government does this kind of thing always with no thought 
as to the outcome 
look what happened with john f kennedy he said instead 
of doing the straightforward pathology work right there in dallas 
they did all this cloakanddagger stuff and now 23 years later 
there are questions that can never be answered questions that 
shouldnt even exist because if the autopsy had been done 
correctly they would all have been answered

just as you are what you eat archaeologist 
william rathje believes you are to a certain extent what you 
throw away 
rathje has some of his students at the university of arizona 
learning more than they might want to know about garbage they sift 
through trash in tucson and dig into landfills around the nation to 
get the true picture of modern society or as rathje puts it to 
see the american lifestyle from the back end 
we do run across some bad stuff but you just put on your 
gloves hold your nose and get through it as fast as you can said 
rathje who spoke recently at a conference of the ohio alliance for 
the environment 
rathje said a lot can be learned about people and society from 
what is thrown away a lot of myths can be dispelled too 
one of those myths he said is that americans eat everything on 
their plates 
the average household throws out 15 percent of the food it 
buys in tucson that is 950 tons of edible food a year he said 
we dug up a tbone steak from 1970 that i swear if we brushed 
the dirt off and cooked it you would eat it he said his 
students determined the steak came from 1970 by looking at 
newspapers and other dated items nearby

alexander dubcek in a speech issued 
saturday denounced the sovietled invasion that ousted him as 
czechoslovakias communist party leader and said his nation needs 
a great popular leap forward 
dubcek is scheduled to give the speech sunday at a ceremony in 
which he will be honored for the reforms he introduced in 1968 
during a period that became known as the prague spring 
he is on his first visit abroad since he was stripped of his 
communist party membership in 1970 and he has expressed concern the 
government might not let him return home because of his statements 
in italy 
speaking of the invasion in 1968 that crushed his reforms and 
established a hardline government dubcek said in his prepared 
speech 
it is my firm conviction that without the external intervention 
in the situation of our party and our czechoslovak society our 
endeavor would have been crowned with success 
dubcek is to receive an honorary degree in political science 
sunday from the university of bologna which is marking its 900th 
birthday the university made his speech available saturday 
dubcek lamented the invasion but expressed hope that 
czechoslovakia will again try to introduce elements of democracy 
it would be enough to have a great popular leap which among 
other things was our movement of rebirth in 1968 in order that our 
historical experiences so profoundly lived return to the surface and 
be openly manifested he wrote 
dubcek who considers himself a communist although he was 
stripped of party membership said the last two decades in 
czechoslovakia were years of economic stagnation sterility and 
incalculable moral losses 
but he added he still had hope saying we are searching for 
something that can open the path to new developments of socialism 
theoretical and practical 
in the prague spring in its internal development and in its 
suffocation by external forces everything is reflected in condensed 
form the crises and the possibilities of socialism his speech 
declared in 1968 we learned that the key to overcome the crisis 
doesnt only come in the economic sphere the key was and 
remains in the political sphere 
the 66yearold dubcek arrived in bologna friday by car he lives 
in bratislava and is retired from a lowly job in a forestry 
department office that was assigned to him 18 years ago 
dubcek served for five months in 1970 as czechoslovakias 
ambassador to turkey but then was summoned back to prague and ousted 
him from the party he had been removed as party leader in april 
1969 
dubcek is expected to remain about 10 days in italy visiting 
florence venice ravenna and possibly rome no schedule has been 
released

thousands of israelis demonstrated saturday for 
reforms in the electoral system that enabled 15 parties to gain 
seats in parliament but gave none enough power to form a government 
the fragmented results of the nov 1 elections have forced prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to make concessions to religious parties in 
return for their joining a coalition with his rightist likud bloc 
both likud and its rival the centerleft labor party need the 
support of the religious parties to form a majority in the 
120member parliament 
under heavy rains some 15000 protesters gathered in malchei 
israel square in tel aviv carrying posters calling for likud and 
labor to form a temporary coalition for the sole purpose of passing 
an electoral reform bill 
the demonstrators carried blueandwhite israeli flags and some 
wore buttons that said i am secular and i am scared the slogan 
referred to potential religious rulings that the small orthodox 
parties could force on the likud government if they become coalition 
partners 
the protesters hope new elections can be held as soon as a new 
electoral system is in place 
under the proposed reform bill voters would select a candidate 
for prime minister rather than vote for a party the majority of the 
members of parliament would be elected in regional elections 
i am sure the message coming from all these thousands of people 
will have an effect said uriel reichman a tel aviv university 
law professor who heads the committee for a constitution in israel 
which sponsored the rally 
under the present electoral system the head of the party winning 
the most parliament seats becomes prime minister provided he is 
able to form a coalition 
likud won 40 seats in the nov 1 elections and labor 39 
shamir made a major concession to the religious parties friday 
when he promised an amendment to the whoisajew law which 
defines who is jewish and thus eligible for automatic israeli 
citizenship 
the orthodox who gained 18 seats altogether in the elections 
want the law amended so that only orthodox rabbis would be able to 
convert nonjews to judaism those converted by nonorthodox rabbis 
would not qualify for citizenship 
jewish leaders in the united states where most jews belong to 
the more liberal streams have said the amendment could split the 
jewish people

a 166 million lawsuit charges that 
four yonkers city council members damaged the citys image and 
financial stability by defying a federal desegregation order that 
led to huge fines against the city 
the classaction lawsuit by 16 residents alleged that the four 
wasted taxpayers money in violation of their oaths of office and 
state laws governing official conduct 
plans for the suit were announced in august shortly after the 
four voted against endorsing a courtordered plan to build low and 
moderateincome housing in the states fourthlargest city lawyers 
said friday they filed the suit earlier in the week 
us district judge leonard sand who had found the city liable 
for 40 years of segregated housing and schools had warned the 
council that failure to support the plan would lead to a finding of 
contempt 
vice mayor henry spallone one of the four council members said 
he might countersue 
its something in america to have somebody sue you to make you 
vote a certain way he said theyre taking a page right out of 
adolf hitlers book 
the lawsuit seeks 40 million each from the four council members 
and 6 million jointly to pay for the contemptofcourt fine imposed 
because of their votes and the alleged damages suffered by yonkers 
officials said friday 
the lawsuit also demands the removal or suspension of the four 
spallone minority leader nicholas longo peter chema and edward 
fagan 
sand found the four councilmen as well as yonkers in contempt 
on aug 2 and imposed fines against the city and against the four 
personally the fine against the city was to escalate daily from 
100 a federal appeals court capped it at 1 million 
in the face of widespread city layoffs chema and longo changed 
their positions the day the fine would have hit 1 million 
the damages sustained by the city of yonkers during the 
period of contempt were horrendous the lawsuit said the 
willful misconduct of the four amounts to gross negligence and 
dereliction of duty waste and illegal conduct 
yonkers paid a total of 819000 each of the four council 
members paid 43500 in personal fines they plan to go to the us 
supreme court to challenge sands power to hold them in contempt 
personally 
the damages sought by the lawsuit represent fines and fees for 
the time spent by lawyers dealing with the contempt issue as well 
as damage to the citys ability to raise money by selling municipal 
bonds its reputation property values and tax rate 
the lawsuit also seeks to bar city manager neil deluca and the 
emergency financial control board the citys fiscal watchdog from 
approving payments to lawyers representing the four councilmembers 
in their personal contempt cases

west germanys top jewish leader said 
saturday he and other members of the jewish community will hold a 
special meeting to deal with the bitter discord following a 
controversial speech on the nazi era 
heinz galinski chairman of the german central council of jews 
said the councils directorate would meet wednesday to discuss the 
furor surrounding the speech by philipp jenninger the president of 
parliament who resigned friday 
jenninger on thursday delivered a parliamentary speech marking 
the 50th anniversary of the kristallnacht pogrom on nov 910 1938 
a night of nazi terror against jews across germany 
in his address jenninger attempted to set the scene in the 1930s 
when adolf hitler came to power saying germans initially found the 
nazi era glorious 
his remarks touched off anger in west germany and abroad with 
critics saying he had shown no remorse over the nazi era 
jenninger defended himself by saying he was misunderstood 
the leftleaning frankfurter rundschau newspaper said saturday 
that no one could accuse jenninger of being a nazi sympathizer and 
noted his strong support for israel but the paper implied in a 
commentary that some conservative germans have difficulties putting 
the nazi era in perspective 
he jenninger did what has become fashionable among some 
conservatives in this republic without consideration for possible 
misunderstandings they try desperately to put into perspective 
germanys 12year departure from the civilized world in such a way 
that the nazi times may be explainable but their uniqueness is 
lost the newspaper said 
also criticized in some quarters was michael fuerst deputy 
chairman of the jewish council who defended jenningers address in 
a television interview 
i welcome that the parliament president described in full 
clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 
especially the fact that everything that hitler did was strongly 
supported by the masses of all germans fuerst said in the 
interview 
galinski said fuersts remarks angered many jews 
he has severely outraged the jewish community in the federal 
republic west germany and also in israel galinski told the 
associated press saturday 
galinski and fuerst were already in a feud over fuersts 
opposition earlier this month to galinskis wishes to address 
parliament during the kristallnacht observances 
ap attempted to reach fuerst at his office in hanover on saturday 
telephone calls were not answered 
a move by the leftist greens party to invite galinski to speak at 
the observances in parlilament was rejected on procedural grounds 
galinski reiterated on saturday his criticism of jenningers 
speech 
the whole address was a big mistake the secondranking 
official in our country has a certain responsibility galinski 
said this speech was given on the wrong day and at the wrong 
place

first lady nancy reagan says she has had to 
protect her husband against bad advice from white house aides 
pushing their own agendas but she doesnt see herself overstepping 
any boundaries 
in a wideranging interview published in sunday editions of the 
los angeles times mrs reagan also discussed such issues as her 
frosty relations with raisa gorbachev wife of the soviet leader 
and her estrangement from her daughter patti davis 
mrs reagan said she felt hurt surprised and disappointed by 
some actions of president reagans staff members and acknowledged 
without apology that she wielded influence over her husband on some 
personnel decisions 
im more aware if somebody is trying to endrun him and have 
their own agenda she said im more aware of that than he is 
it just never occurs to him that anybody is going to do that 
a prime example she said was the irancontra affair 
he did not know what was going on and thats not right mrs 
reagan said 
she was especially angry at former chief of staff donald t 
regan who in his book revealed mrs reagans interest in astrology 
and portrayed her as an interfering tyrant 
the first lady said that when reagan underwent colon cancer 
surgery regan wanted him to get up and attend a news conference in 
two weeks a request mrs reagan said she turned down she said 
regan saw her as meddling 
but a first lady is a wife first of all she said i dont 
care that comes first for me im sure with everybody that comes 
first and i certainly felt that for ronnies interest it was to 
his interest 
mrs reagan declined to elaborate further on her relationship 
with regan or her interest in astrology two matters she planned to 
discuss in her upcoming autobiography 
as to her relationship with mrs gorbachev the first lady said 
that cultural differences may have contributed to the testiness of 
their brief meetings and that by our standards mrs gorbachev 
could be considered rude 
now by her standards it may not be mrs reagan said 
its just coming from two completely different cultures and 
trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not 
understanding how the other works she added i think there was 
way too much attention paid about that whole thing 
mrs reagan became tearful when discussing her estrangement from 
her daughter and said the two havent spoken in more than a year 
she said she hoped the estrangement would not be permanent 
i mean im her mother she said her eyes filling with 
tears i hope not

might not continue to work out after they join

the masses ms merryman says 
but if the intent of the machinery is to take inches off your 
stomach and thighs most of the products displayed would also take 
inches off your wallet

the government newspaper on saturday 
accused the opposition daily of trying to block international aid 
for damage inflicted by hurricane joan by saying the government is 
lying about the extent of the damage 
the opposition paper la prensa charged friday that the 
government was planning to use the aid for the military not to help 
the thousands left homeless when joan struck nicaragua last month 
la prensa also accused the sandinistas of demanding aid from 
the diplomatic community and said they had asked for too much 
and in a bad way 
barricada the official paper of the ruling sandinista party 
said saturday in an editorial that the damage from the hurricane was 
even worse than first thought 
the newspaper linked la prensas charges to the united states 
which has been backing antisandinista rebels since 1982 it said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also had been casting doubt 
on the actual destination of international aid 
almost simultaneously la prensa and the nicaraguan political 
parties on the right began their campaign of lies and insults 
aimed at politicizing the hurricane and blocking international 
aid barricada said 
barricada said there would not be a replay of a 1972 scandal 
surrounding foreign aid to help nicaragua recover from a devasting 
earthquake that caused extensive damage to the capital the 
dictatorship of anastasio somoza who was overthrown by the 
sandinistas in 1979 siphoned off the aid and never rebuilt managua

presidentelect george bush will bring the 
intelligence communitys unique perspective with him to the 
white house but that knowledge will have little effect on the 
functions of the cia the agencys deputy director said saturday 
obviously it is a unique circumstance we have never had a 
president who has served as head of the cia before robert m 
gates said he brings a knowledge perspective no other 
president has 
gates was interviewed by reporters here during a visit along with 
sen david boren dokla boren chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee was being inducted into the oklahoma hall of fame by the 
oklahoma heritage association 
gates said the presidentelects familiarity with the agencys 
operation may make him more demanding of the cia 
gates said however that he does not expect the cia to take a 
more active or visible role in the intelligence community while bush 
is in office 
first of all the cia is not a policymaking agency gates 
said we are there primarily to collect information analyze it 
evaluate it and provide it to the president and his senior policy 
officials to help inform their decisions 
we do not make that policy we do not recommend policy and 
certainly there will be no changes in that 
gates a 22year veteran of the cia who was appointed deputy 
director by president reagan said he does not know if he will be 
reappointed but probably would leave the agency if new leadership 
were brought in 
the white house has asked for resignations from all political 
appointees so that bush can put his own stamp on things the 
transition team has not indicated whether bush intends to replace 
cia director william webster a former fbi chief appointed to head 
the agency after william casey died in may 1987 
it is very important that the president have a director of 
central intelligence that he is comfortable with and i think judge 
webster has done a fine job gates said and as i said before 
we all serve at the pleasure of the president 
gates also said he does not expect the soviet union to treat bush 
any different than other presidents because of his cia background 
they have had the opportunity to interact with him for a long 
time and in a variety of different positions gates said i 
dont think it will have any impact

the nations first female episcopal bishop has been 
denied affirmation of ordination by the standing committee of the 
episcopal diocese of dallas church officials said 
the rev cv westapher parish priest of the church of the 
incarnation and president of the committee said friday that the 
vote was 32 on tuesday with one abstention against the proposed 
consecration of the rev barbara harris a priest from philadelphia 
the rev harris 58 was elected last month by the diocese of 
massachusetts in september as suffragan or assistant bishop of 
massachusetts 
before she can be consecrated however her election must be 
approved by a majority of the 118 diocesan bishops and their 
standing committees the failure of either group to give majority 
consent voids the election 
westapher said he could not predict how other standing committees 
in the church would vote no election in anyones memory has been 
overturned he said 
the rev harris consecration has been set for early february 
from the outset her election was controversial among 
traditionalists who oppose the ordination or consecration of women 
as priests and bishops all but a handful of dioceses however have 
ordained women as priests 
the dallas committee is made up of three clergy and three laity 
members westapher noting that the church has many black bishops 
said race was never an issue in the committees discussion the rev 
harris is black 
because he is the only conservative on the committee westapher 
said he was the only one who raised the issue of her being a woman 
as a barrier to elevation one member found her divorce a problem 
he said 
the committee based its judgment on what members considered the 
rev harris lack of qualifications he said politics was involved 
in electing her over others who he said were much better 
qualified 
dont misunderstand us he said she is brilliant but she 
never went to college or had structured seminary training that is 
part of the discipline of preparation for the ministry whether it 
be for a deacon priest or the episcopacy 
last month bishops of six of the 99 dioceses of the episcopal 
church denounced her election as the first female bishop in the 
worldwide anglican communion 
the episcopal church is one of 28 national branches of that 
communion 
declaring that the anglican faith would be irrreparably 
compromised if harris were consecrated a bishop the six bishops 
said they cannot accept the validity of ordinations or 
confirmations she administers

the murder case against a disbarred lawyer 
accused of beating his adopted daughter to death rests on 
circumstantial evidence which can be a stumbling block with jurors 
according to a legal expert 
prosecutors in the joel steinberg trial admit they have no 
eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking him directly to 6yearold 
lisas death so they must try to disprove every reasonable 
possibility except the defendants guilt 
richard uviller professor of criminal law at columbia university 
law school said the word circumstantial is perceived as 
dirty in the minds of many jurors the prosecutors first task 
is to overcome this prejudice he said 
circumstantial evidence should not necessarily be thought of as 
inferior uviller said last week it is no different than other 
kinds of evidence

wall street wanted it expected it and got it 
but when a george bush victory finally arrived there was no 
celebration 
instead investors sighed then retreated 
when all was said and done the market acted more relieved that 
michael dukakis did not win than pleased that george bush did 
i dont think anyone really wanted bush he was the lesser of 
two evils asserted john burnett senior vice president at 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
i dont know how to describe wall streets attitude said 
thomas walsh head of equity trading for nikko securities co 
international inc you heard more im glad dukakis didnt win 
than im glad bush won 
the markets reaction was relief that dukakis did not win 
added michael metz vice president for oppenheimer amp co 
analysts said investors felt little like celebrating as they 
awoke to postelection reality and the same problems that had 
troubled the market in the period leading up to the vote interest 
rates the dollar and the budget and trade deficits 
with the election over the most immediate question was whether 
the federal reserve would move to raise interest rates 
next was how bush would reduce the massive federal budget 
deficit many analysts feared bush had backed himself into a corner 
by vowing not to raise taxes 
then there was the question of the deteriorating dollar and how 
foreign investors would react the currency got a downward shove 
early in the week from bush adviser and harvard economist martin 
feldstein who suggested that a lower dollar would do more to extend 
the economic recovery and help the us trade deficit the weak 
dollar dragged down bonds and stocks 
added to those concerns was the newest question mark would bush 
be able to work with congress to solve all those problems 
and intruding on an already nervous market were fears that 
congress might move to put the brakes on leveraged buyouts those 
concerns emerged when republican senate minority leader bob dole 
suggested at midweek that the deductibility of interest rates used 
for buyouts be eliminated 
with little to soothe their shattered confidence investors fled 
to the sidelines to sort out the prospects for the future 
this postelection paralysis was reflected in a sharp decline in 
trading activity volume on the big board averaged 13862 million 
shares a day down from 15050 million the week before 
on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials suffered its 
worst oneday loss in nearly seven months falling 4766 points to 
206703 the last bigger loss was 10146 points on april 14 
the dow industrial averages 7877point loss for the full week 
was the biggest since aug 812 when the bluechip indicator 
dropped 8161 points 
the new york stock exchange composite index lost 446 over the 
week to end at 15124 the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market lost 726 to end the week at 37376 and the 
american stock exchange market value index was down 604 at 29148 
analysts said the markets failure to respond to the bush victory 
was in itself a message to the presidentelect 
ok george what do you have up your sleeve thats what people 
want to know walsh said 
for the nearterm analysts say investors need answers they say 
bush needs to move quickly to eliminate the uncertainty that has 
pervaded wall street in the aftermath of his victory 
the way he conducts himself and what he says between now and 
inauguration about how hes going to deal with the deficit and other 
concerns will make a difference in the market burnett said 
until those and other questions are resolved investors could 
remain noncommittal 
the market could stay in this trading range for a good amount 
of time said alfred e goldman vice president of ag edwards amp 
sons inc
