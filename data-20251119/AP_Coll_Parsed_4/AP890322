the government plans unsettling changes in 
britains centuriesold pub system after a commission found that a 
complex monopoly situation exists in the supply of beer 
the key measure announced tuesday would limit to 2000 the number 
of public houses any single brewery could own that would mean the 
biggest pubowning breweries would have to sell thousands of retail 
outlets 
another measure would bar breweries from issuing lowinterest 
loans to independent pubs in exchange for an exclusive contract to 
supply them 
the monopolies and mergers commission conducted a 2year 
investigation into britains 239yearold tied house system 
tied pubs are owned by individual breweries and represent about 
55 percent of britains 82000 public houses they sell only the 
beers supplied by the owner 
the remaining pubs are called free houses and can buy beer from 
any supplier 
but about half of the free houses are linked to breweries through 
low interest loans according to trade secretary lord young 
the commission report said the current system of supplying beer 
to retailers restricts competition at all levels against the 
public interest 
young said he was inclined to implement all of the commissions 
recommendations 
a trade department spokesman said it would be up to the office of 
fair trading to discuss with the breweries how the measures would be 
implemented and provide a timetable the spokesman who was not 
identified said the commission suggested giving the brewers three 
years to sell off the required pubs 
young said the present system severely limits the 
opportunities for an independent wholesaling sector to prosper the 
result is that both wholesale and retail prices are higher than they 
need to be 
he said the price of a pint of beer in a pub increased by 15 
percent between 1979 and 1987 after adjusting for inflation and 
that was almost double the rise in beer prices in restaurants in the 
same period 
in london a pint of beer in a pub costs around a pound 172 
britains biggest brewer bass plc owns more than 7000 pubs 
the countrys six largest brewers own about 32000 public houses 
70 percent of the total number of breweryowned pubs 
the brewers society an organization representing britains 65 
beermakers called the recommendations draconian unpredictable in 
their effects and a complete leap in the dark

scouts and girl guides celebrated their 75th birthday with a cake 
and promise of a new designer uniform 
details of the new dress for the worlds 45 million brownies 
aged seven to 11 were to remain secret until viewed by brownie 
chiefs but designer jeff banks firm confirmed on tuesday that the 
color will remain brown 
there would have been absolute outrage if we changed any of the 
traditional colors said banks assistant sarahjane owen but she 
added we are looking to use a bit more yellow it is a nicer 
color than the orangeybrown they have at the moment 
brownies began four years after girl guides called girl scouts 
in the united states and some other countries first appeared in 
britain in 1910 to give girls a chance to have the fun their 
brothers were having in the boy scouts

of all the nomination processes that lead to 
academy awards none is more complicated or controversial than 
the foreign language film award 
its commonly called the foreign film award not so nominees 
must be in a language other than english hence films from england 
australia and canada except for canadian films in french such as 
the recent the decline of the american empire are not eligible 
in this category 
the controversial part of the foreign language award stems from 
the fact that the national academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences and its voters have no control over the nominations the 
countries themselves can nominate one film per year the system has 
been criticized for its inequities 
critics claim that governments especially military or communist 
dictatorships sometimes refuse to nominate films showing those 
countries in a bad light politics in the selection committee can 
also eliminate likely choices 
three years ago akira kurosawas widely acclaimed ran was not 
submitted because of wrangling among japanese committee members the 
directors branch of the academy rallied to the great filmmaker and 
nominated him for best director 
this years nominations for the foreign language oscar managed to 
dodge controversy two of the entries stand out spains women on 
the verge of a nervous breakdown which has attracted rave 
reviews and denmarks pelle the conqueror winner of the cannes 
film festival prize for best picture 
women on the verge of a nervous breakdown written and 
directed by pedro almodovar concerns two madrid women whose 
personal and professional lives are in chaos the comedy has been a 
big success in the united states 44 million in 17 weeks of 
limited release and critics have compared it to the screwball 
comedies of howard hawks leo mccarey and george stevens 
the star carmen maura is not surprised by the american 
response her friendship with almodovar goes back to when he worked 
for the madrid telephone company and she was a television talkshow 
hostess 
when i began to work with pedro 10 years ago and we had a very 
special situation together she said during a visit here i said 
to him hey pedro dont worry because in one time the americans 
will understand you 
i am very proud of pedro almodovar i think hes very genuine 
his sense of humor is very american sometimes and mine also so i 
understand why you americans like women on the verge 
max von sydow who stars in pelle the conqueror along with 
young pelle hvenegaard as his son also has high praise for his 
director danish bille august 
hes very very sensitive and has a great hand with people 
especially children very softspoken he seems almost shy but hes 
a brilliant man and im really looking forward to seeing what hell 
do in the future 
pelle 11 million during 11 weeks of limited domestic 
release concerns a swedish peasant who brings his son to a danish 
farm where the father endures a series of indignities as a lowly 
worker the film was shot on the bleak landscape during one of the 
coldest winters in decades 
it looks more rugged than it really was von sydow said we 
had to spend a few cold days and nights out in the open but thank 
god we had warmth nearby 
hanussen the entry from hungary is the third of three 
impressive films by istvan szabo on themes of human folly and free

abandoned by his family to the streets of bombay where he consorts 
with thieves drug dealers prostitutes and pimps

an overzealous sandwich shop operator may 
unwittingly be responsible for a proposed a law that would ban 
junk fax the states consumer protection chief said 
richard kessel and the chairmen of the legislatures consumer 
protection committees said tuesday theyve agreed on a bill that 
would allow the state to fine companies for sending unsolicited 
advertising through facsimile machines 
it was one particularly illtimed fax transmission that set the 
plans in motion kessel said 
less than a month ago kessel said he was preparing to send a 
memo on the shoreham nuclear power plant to gov mario cuomo when 
his fax machine beeped spitting out a threepage menu from a 
submarine sandwich shop he declined to name the restaurant 
since he had to rush to a meeting he said he didnt have time 
to send the memo to the governor until the next day 
the last thing you want when youre trying to meet a deadline 
or trying to get a memo in to your boss is to be disturbed by 
someone trying to sell draperies or submarine sandwiches kessel 
said 
the bill touted tuesday was designed to stem potential problems 
from the booming facsimile technology kessels office hasnt yet 
received many complaints but im complaining he said 
companies or individuals found guilty of sending unwanted fax 
transmissions could be fined 20000 kessel said consumers would 
also be allowed to sue a violator for damages plus attorneys fees 
and court costs he said 
the bill which so far has been introduced in the senate is 
similar to legislation being considered in connecticut oregon and 
washington state kessel said 
theres an estimated 250000 fax machines in use in new york 
state and new england with the exception of connecticut said peter 
muller spokesman for new york telephone an estimated 2 million 
machines are operating nationwide he said 
the problem is just starting said assemblyman jerrold nadler 
sen eugene levy predicted easy passage of the bill in both 
houses 
fax onto others as you would fax onto yourself levy said

setting aside a 1200year tradition 
of shipbuilding and trade the hearty germans who people this 
blustery port are turning to high technology to survive the 
withering of their waterfront 
undercut by asians who can build ships and package fish much 
cheaper the heavily unionized shipyards and factories that were the 
heartbeat of bremen have suffered a steady decline for more than a 
decade 
the 155percent unemployment rate borne by this stronghold of 
sailors and stevedores is nearly twice the national average it 
marks bremen as one of the bleak counterpoints to the economic 
success stories in west germanys south 
bremens industrial and government leaders say the solution is a 
complete personality change for the hanseatic port that has been 
focused on the sea since its founding in the 8th century 
they see the citys future in the hightechnology industries that 
already have found a foothold among the wharves and drydocks on the 
weser river about 35 miles inland from the north sea 
but even the most optimistic of bremens economic forecasters 
concede that a radical reversal of the downward trend is unlikely 
we have no room for expansion ortwin baum director of 
bremens association of employers said in an interview that is 
the great disadvantage we have in trying to compete with other 
states for new business 
the city of bremen which under west germanys mazelike 
governmental structure also ranks as a state is already chockablock 
with factories wharves and trim rows of postwar townhouses 
accommodating the citys 540000 residents 
there are also the disincentives of high business taxes 
inadequate public transport empty city coffers and a work force 
with more back muscle than computer knowhow 
despite the heavy odds against a swift change from bluecollar to 
whitecollar industries the outlook for the automobile aviation 
and space industries represented here holds a promise of enough 
expansion to compensate for the further cutbacks expected in heavy 
industry 
while bremens economy may not get better soon no one expects it 
to get much worse 
bremen is reducing its dependence on classical old industries 
like shipbuilding and fishprocessing said uwe beckmeyer 
bremens state minister for economics technology and trade the 
resettlement of hightechnology enterprises and research facilities 
here will create 3000 new jobs by the turn of the century 
much of the expansion will be among the industrial giants like 
daimlerbenz which produces mercedes cars and other hightech 
companies like krupp atlas electronics and the 
messerschmidtboelkowblohm enterprise involved in air and space 
transport production 
its true that bremen is going to be seeing new work places 
opening up in the hightechnology fields but im not convinced they 
will be plentiful enough to counteract the losses in the marine 
industries said dagmar lill head of state governments labor 
department weve seen about 20000 jobs disappear in bremen over 
the past 10 years or so and that has created a problem with 
longterm unemployment that these new jobs will not resolve 
local government and private organizations have been created over 
the past few years to address bremens labor crisis but ms lill 
says there is little hope of retraining the over40 manual laborers 
from the waterfront who are the first laid off by the troubled 
shipyards and steel mills for the kinds of jobs that will be 
available in the future 
west german social security provides experienced workers who are 
laid off with 68 percent of their previous salaries which older and 
unskilled workers often find sufficient to live on 
about onefourth of the jobless population is under 25 and the 
younger unemployed stand a better chance of gaining entrance into 
governmentfunded training programs than their elders who are often 
content to stay on the government dole 
renee seehof directs the 5yearold bremen unemployed selfhelp 
agency bras which uses public funds to hire 200 young bremens and 
train them for the specialized positions expected to open in the 
region 
there are so many similar assistance groups in each 
neighborhood and church and social agency that its hard to believe 
that those who want to learn a new trade cant find an opportunity 
to do so ms seehof said 
the sorry state of bremens finances has forced the closure of 
some schools and other public services triggering strikes and 
encumbering more of the population with personal debts 
the liberal social democrats have governed bremen throughout the 
postwar period and the conservative christian democrats who govern 
nationally are under fire on grounds that they failed to rescue 
bremen 
the turmoil thus has fueled the rise of a small but vocal 
ultrarightist faction in bremen which is the seat of west 
germanys largest radical rightwing organization the combined 
german national democratic party and the german peoples union 
we will be running a full list of candidates in the next 
elections 1990 the partys press spokesman karlheinz vorsatz 
said we can only expect even broader support when the economic 
situation is as bad as it is

the city will soon have a new place where the 
wealthy can go to be rich together north cove yacht harbor a 
dockominium with 26 watery parking spaces that will cost 
600000 to 2 million each 
this is not something that people without considerable funds 
are going to be able to afford observed john gavin former us 
ambassador to mexico and chairman of the company building the marina 
did we say marina 
this is a harbor for megayachts not a marina gavin 
explained in an interview tuesday 
but with only 400 megayachts those 100 feet or longer afloat 
will the harbor attract enough business to its 375acre manmade 
cove off the hudson river 
we hope to create that demand gavin said were going into 
uncharted waters here 
the yacht harbor scheduled to open in june has these selling 
points location location and location 
north cove is a ushaped notch in manhattans battery park city 
a community of office towers and apartment buildings that stands on 
landfill on the edge of the hudson river 
the harbor is shadowed by the towers of the world trade center 
and the world financial center it is a fiveminute limousine ride 
from wall street it commands a fine view of the huge maxwells 
coffee cup sign in hoboken nj 
the marina uh megayacht harbor also will offer electrical 
telephone and cable television connections fresh water sewage 
collection and concierge service harbors elsewhere on the east 
coast charge a lot less the wall street journal has noted but 
they dont have pedicurists on call 
until condominium plans are approved by the state slips will be 
leased for sevenyear periods gavin said the longest 155 feet 
will cost about 620 a day whether a vessel uses it or not and 
about 16 million over seven years the asking purchase price for 
such slips is expected to be around 2 million gavin said 
for the smaller fry there are 80foot slips which lease for 
565000 or about 220 a day 
north cove promises to sublease slips for its primary tenants 
when they are not using them which in the case of most vessels 
will be most of the time 
george rosen president of the yacht owners association of new 
york said that when broken down on a nightly basis north coves 
rates would be two or three times higher than those charged at the 
areas other leading marinas including port imperial across the 
hudson river in new jersey and the citys west 79th street boat 
basin also on the hudson 
he said two marina operators had decided not to seek the rights 
to operate at north cove because the costs would force them to 
charge prohibitively high slip rates 
david emil president of the battery park city authority said 
one reason gavins group was selected as developer of north cove was 
their promise to let the public get up close to the yachts and thus 
enliven the citys waterfront 
the public is not to be kept away gavin said there will 
be security but people will be able to walk around and see the 
yachts there will be no gates and fences each yacht will be 
expected to have one of its own hands on watch 
with the exception of donald trump whose 282foot trump 
princess wouldnt even fit into north cove dont the rich resent 
being on display 
no gavin said theyre used to it in the mediterranean

allegations of police racism and brutality 
have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a 
progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial 
harmony 
the deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry followed 
10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown 
hotel touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside 
review of the department 
its like a watch spring you can only wind the watch so 
tightly before its going to snap i think were approaching that 
breaking point said van hayden 25 a student who says police 
beat him at the hotel 
the citys police chief john laux says there is no reason to 
assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present 
in all segments of society 
the whole society to different degrees has problems of 
racism he said 
in a letter to police supervisors in midfebruary laux said 
let me make one thing perfectly clear any act of bias will be 
dealt with directly and severely there will be no tolerance for 
that type of inexcusable behavior 
since former vice president hubert h humphrey then a 
35yearold mayor running for the us senate electrified the 1948 
democratic national convention with his historic speech in support 
of civil rights minneapolis has been viewed as a liberal 
progressive city 
some including hayden say that image now blocks progress 
i think this city has to wake up everyone always says i 
cant believe this is happening in minnesota in minneapolis the 
home of progressiveness that is real tricky hayden said if 
we get preoccupied with the image of the city were not going to be 
able to thoroughly address the problems were facing 
the liberal image is a false picture said chris nisan a 
university of minnesota student who has been involved in recent 
protests 
in a series of rallies in recent weeks protesters demanded that 
officers involved in the drug raid be suspended charges against 
those arrested at the hotel be dropped and that a citizen police 
review board be established 
city council voted last week to study the problem 
there are bad apples in every bunch and the minneapolis police 
department is no exception said councilwoman sayles belton i 
dont think they the good officers are pleased with the few that 
are giving them the bad rap the spoilers 
lloyd smalley 71 and lillian weiss 65 were killed jan 25 in 
a fire that started after police hurled a stun grenade into their 
apartment where others also lived during a drug raid 
no one conducting the raid knew the elderly people were living 
there said laux a grand jury decided not to bring charges against 
any officers but an fbi investigation is continuing 
in the hotel scuffle police said they responsed to a call of a 
loud party partygoers alleged that officers used the term 
nigger and beat some of those arrested laux said his officers 
have denied using racial names and said protesters lied about the 
number of people receiving medical attention following the arrests 
gleason glover president of the minneapolis urban league which 
works for interracial cooperation said police racism has been a 
problem since he took over the league position 21 years ago 
the matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on 
for at least the 21 years ive been here but i think the deaths 
pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the 
case in matters of police misconduct glover said 
there is deep resentment in both the black community and among 
police officers with regard to how they feel they are perceived by 
each other i do not see a quick fix solution to it glover 
said 
allegations of police misconduct currently are reviewed by a 
panel appointed by the mayor the panel can only make 
recommendations laux opposes establisment of a citizen panel to 
look into police actions 
the key point is that any time the head of the police 
department cannot hire fire or impose discipline you are no longer 
in charge he said 
laux said the 750member department which includes 62 minority 
members and 68 white women will begin cultural awareness training 
for all officers probably this fall 
we need to get more education about ourselves and about 
everyone else our goal is to find out who can offer that to us and 
in what form said laux but it must be thoughtful and be done 
by the right people

the legislature refused to call a 
referendum to drop the north and rename the state dakota 
deciding north dakota will be just as cold by any other name 
fixing the name to make us become the new eden or shangrila is 
shortsighted state sen ray holmberg argued during a halfhour 
debate before a packed senate chamber 
what do we do next legislative session our unique climate and 
our warm people will still be here 
the senate voted 3615 tuesday to defeat a resolution that would 
have put the issue to voters in 1990 had they approved congress 
would have been asked to allow the state to change its name 
dakota means friend or ally in the language of the sioux 
indians supporters of the resolution argued that the warm meaning 
of dakota is obscured by the geographical designation which 
connotes a cold harsh climate 
the most positive word of north dakota is dakota said the 
resolutions prime sponsor sen tim mathern dakota speaks to 
what we are most proud about the wholesomeness friendliness and 
hospitality of our people 
its a warmer name like its people added sen jim yockim 
its a name with chutzpah 
gov george sinner said he wasnt opposed to the idea his 
tourism director jim fuglie saw it as a marketing dream and 
promised to resign to campaign for the name change if the 
legislature approved the referendum 
however sen wayne stenehjem of grand forks may have spoken for 
many opponents when he said his constituents recommended he change 
his own name if he voted to change north dakotas 
the idea has been floated several times but the latest attempt 
was sharply criticized in letters to the editor and it gave the 
state less than flattering national attention 
in addition to being panned editorially by the washington post 
the issue became the focus of a tongueincheek campaign by the 
billings mont gazette to find a new name for new dakota 
the winner was manitscolda as in man its colda

on march 26 1979 israel and egypt signed a 
historic peace treaty in an effort to break the cycle of mideast 
wars for israel the results have been mixed and the promise not 
fulfilled here is the first of two reports 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ten years after signing a treaty with egypt that 
ended three decades of war israel has mixed feelings about the 
stunted peace with the largest and most powerful arab state 
when president anwar sadat of egypt broke the arab taboo on 
dealing with israel with his historic 1977 visit to jerusalem the 
event stirred a euphoria in israel unmatched since the founding of 
the jewish state 
but there is now deep chagrin in isrsael that the promise of such 
peacemaking did not lead to other peace treaties with arab states 
and that egypt shunned close ties in trade and tourism 
real peace is daily contacts in many fields like we see between 
european states who a few years ago fought each other like eternal 
enemies prime minister yitzhak shamir said recently we are still 
far from this 
according to israeli statistics 63000 israeli tourists visited 
egypt last year and israel exported 6 million in goods to cairo 
egyptian tourism totaled only 100 people last year while egyptian 
exports reached 25 million to 3 million a diplomatic source in 
cairo said 
the clearest evidence of the undeveloped peace is the absence of 
any celebrations in jerusalem or cairo to mark the march 26 1979 
signing of the treaty on the white house lawn 
however the pact has survived sadats 1981 assassination the 
killing of seven israeli tourists and an embassy employee in 1985 
and crossborder raids by palestinians including one in 1988 in 
which three israelis were killed 
egypt showed no signs of wavering in upholding sadats pledge 
that there would be no more wars despite israels 1981 
annexation of the golan heights captured from syria the 198285 
invasion of lebanon and the ongoing palestinian uprising that began 
in december 1987 
after seven years of squabbling israel handed back to egypt the 
disputed beach resort of taba this month without the diehard 
opposition of israeli rightwingers who fought the sinai pullout in 
1982 
will the treaty last another 10 years i tell you i dont know 
i cant be sure said eliahu benelissar israels first 
ambassador to cairo 
but i can assure you that today in egypt i see no sign of any 
will to go back to the past situation of war thats something in 
fact its immense said benelissar now a parliament member 
representing the rightwing likud bloc 
ezer weizman then defense minister for likud and now science 
minister for the leftleaning labor party said the biggest 
disappointment was israels failure to follow up on the treaty 
i was hoping for a much better situation especially regarding 
the palestinian problem said weizman who quit the cabinet to 
protest the lack of progress in 1980 toward granting palestinians 
autonomy 
peace with egypt changed weizmans world view completely the 
former pilot and air force commander became one of israels leading 
doves and advocates talks with plo chairman yasser arafat 
its a pity we lost 10 years but it is better late than 
never said weizman in an interview 
from israels point of view the greatest benefit of the treaty 
was reducing the likelihood of an arab coalition forming as it did 
in 1973 to launch a war against israel 
there is no war with egypt and theres not going to be a war 
and the peace from this point of view is a real peace said 
avraham tamir a retired army general who negotiated the military 
aspects of israels withdrawal from sinai 
the peace with egypt was an historical achievement because 
without this peace we would have passed at least one more war and 
there are no winners in these wars tamir said in an interview 
the peace treaty allowed israel to scale down its arms race with 
the arab world and reduce the amount of time israels 
soldiercitizens spend in uniform 
but benelissar a member of parliaments foreign affairs and 
defense committee stressed in an interview at his parliament office 
that israelis had not yet been convinced their war of survival was 
over 
israelis know that egypt has recognized israel as a reality 
but this doesnt mean egypt has recognized israels right to exist 
as a nation he said egyptians did not depart from what the 
arab world represents a total negation of the rights of jews to 
live as an independent sovereign nation 
benelissar who was on the negotiating team that produced the 
treaty with egypt said if warmer relations had evolved it could 
have melted the barriers to understanding 
we are still back in the pre1977 myths and traumas this is 
peace but it may be seen by some as a tactical peace in which 
egypt signed an agreement only to get back land he said

some of the us soldiers taking part 
in annual team spirit exercises with south korean forces are 
puzzled and angry about growing antiamerican protests in a nation 
they are helping to defend 
the exercises involving 200000 south korean and us troops are 
becoming increasingly controversial as south korean radicals demand 
an end to the us military presence in their country opinion polls 
indicate many ordinary south koreans have growing reservations about 
it 
many young american soldiers think the same as the koreans 
they dont want us here and we dont want to be here said an 
officer who declined to be named they want to go home 
some us officers and soldiers say antiamericanism is creating 
morale problems and some dont want to serve in south korea because 
they dont feel welcome they ask why the united states makes a 
massive defense commitment to a nation where protesters regularly 
attack us government facilities and stage violent antiamerican 
protests 
a us officer who asked not to be identified said radical 
students hurled firebombs at an american unit during the exercises 
around wonju the bombs caused no damage and the protesters fled in 
a car he said 
it left a funny feeling he said 
south korean and us officials insist antiamericanism is a 
minor problem confined to a radical fringe and that relations 
between the two nations remain as close as ever but us soldiers 
who are told to avoid wearing uniforms on the streets so as not to 
offend koreans dont agree 
the command position is that antiamericanism is a minority 
view and the command doesnt want to hear anyone publicly opposing 
that position a us air force officer said in an interview 
the command keeps saying in effect turn the other cheek 
thats not working antiamericanism seems to be increasing and 
after a while you get tired of it 
team spirit the secondlargest exercise staged by us 
forces is a symbol of american commitment to south korea every 
spring the roads around wonju are jammed with us and south korean 
tanks and trucks packed with soldiers 
but opinion polls indicate many koreans have doubts about the 
us military presence and support phasing out american forces a 
recent government survey said 591 percent support a gradual us 
withdrawal and 72 percent want immediate withdrawal 
antiamericanism has bloomed in recent months because of trade 
friction and a perception that washington backed past authoritarian 
governments koreans also complain the united states treats their 
nation as an unimportant satellite despite its enormous economic 
growth and emergence as an asian power 
the resentment aimed at us forces is a stunning reversal after 
years of gratitude for the american military intervention in 1950 
that saved the south from a communist invasion by north korea us 
forces remained after the korean war and 43000 are based in the 
south 
us and south korean leaders insist the american military 
presence is vital to protect the south from north korea which has 
staged intermittent attacks against the south on a february visit 
to seoul president bush said american forces have kept the south 
free and will remain as long as they are wanted 
an extra 30000 us troops including national guard navy and 
air force units are flown in during team spirit to practice 
bringing in us reinforcements in the event of a north korean 
attack 
maj bud bowles of the hawaii national guard said some members of 
his unit were worried about coming to south korea because of the 
antiamericanism soldiers were warned to be careful in towns and to 
travel in groups he said 
but our guys think south korea is worth defending if the 
koreans want to defend themselves he said 
lt col chuck andre of pittsburgh an army officer who is based 
in south korea said the antiamericanism was not a serious problem 
and should be seen as part of the nations political development 
as a country grows youre going to have critical minorities 
its part of democracy it doesnt bother me in the least he said 
like other senior officers andre insisted us forces are needed 
in south korea to prevent a north korean attack he said his country 
has a special bond with south korea because it was one of the few 
nations to help the united states with military aid during the 
vietnam war 
one of the finest allies we have is the republic of korea he 
said

nadezhda zirka lives 35 miles from 
the chernobyl nuclear power plant but only 200 yards from a 
ukranian village abandoned due to radiation from the chernobyl 
explosion 
nearby pigs are born deformed and families in another village 
are packing in response to an evacuation order issued just a few 
weeks ago 
i am afraid to live here now said zirka one of 230000 
people who live on land so contaminated that they must eat food 
grown elsewhere for fear of exceeding radiation limits according to 
the communist party daily pravda 
nearly three years after the chernobyl explosion 80 miles north 
of kiev blasted bits of nuclear reactor as far away as poland 
radiation dominates life downwind 
the april 26 1986 blast the worlds worst atomic accident 
involved one of the plants reactors and killed 31 people 
in the narodichi district well beyond the danger zone 18 miles 
in radius that was evacuated days after the accident radiation has 
driven families from their homes destroyed farmers faith in their 
own produce and terrified parents 
yuri spizhenko of the ukrainian ministry of health said in a 
recent interview that 5000 of narodichis 28000 residents have 
fled in the past three years only a few hundred were evacuated by 
government order and received any kind of aid 
officials face an upset populace at every step as residents 
complain theyre still being told too little too late but georgi 
a gotovchits deputy chairman of the regions executive committee 
told the associated press his people are doing the best they can 
dealing with a massive problem for which there are no textbooks 
for gotovchits the worst moments come when a constituent asks 
what will happen to his children after 10 years of living with 
safe radiation 
there is no answer gotovchits said 
we cant sleep says maria s sheluk zirkas neighbor in 
nozdrishche we cant work for us everything is terrible we 
cant drink the milk were afraid of the potatoes nothing could be 
worse 
gotovchits says thousands of radiation tests were needed to check 
hundreds of square miles of territory and that is why maps showing 
the extent and level of contamination have been released only in the 
past six weeks 
zirkas yellow country cottage with carved skyblue window frames 
stands just 200 yards from the guardpost barring traffic from novoe 
sharno spizhenko said the irregular pattern of the fallout 
depending on wind and the radioactivity of specific particles left 
it safe on her side of what locals call the border 
but children run where they want zirka points out looking 
at her toddler bundled in gray wool 
asked why she has not moved away zirka echoes the answer given 
by every worried peasant interviewed in the district where could 
i go 
in the handful of villages in narodichi district evacuated by 
government order in 1986 peasants were paid for their lost houses 
land and farm animals gotovchits said a typical family received 
32000 to 36800 or 10 years pay for the average farm worker 
but since people like elena baranchuk in nozdrishche are 
considered safe she and her family would receive nothing 
we dont have the money said the collective farm worker and 
mother of three as she dabbed tears with her scarf every kopeck 
went into a new house built just before the chernobyl explosion she 
explained 
about 18 miles away from nozdrishche at the petrovsky animal 
farm 37 of 150 piglets born last year were deformed and nearly all 
of the rest were too weak to survive said veterinarian dr pyotr 
kudin 
thirtyfive calves were born with such abnormalities as six legs 
or missing ribs kudin said all of the deformed animals died soon 
after birth but he said he sent photographs of them to the 
radiation research institute in kiev 
before the accident nothing like this happened said kudin 
but scientists at the institute said genetics not radiation was 
to blame they said other farms with higher radiation levels havent 
experienced such a rash of birth defects according to vasily 
voituk chairman of the collective farm 
the farms cows give milk with radiation levels five to six times 
the standard voituk said so we dont drink it instead it is 
processed into butter and hard cheese which gotovchits said reduces 
the contamination to a permissible level 
ivan los of the radiation medicine institute established in kiev 
after chernobyl said no one is living in an area where the 
radiation dosage is greater than 25 rems per year the maximum for 
the third year after an accident 
soviet officials in november set a lifetime maximum of 35 rems 
which prompted evacuation orders for 25 more villages just a few 
weeks ago even with clean food and drink cutting their internal 
radiation exposure residents would receive more than 35 rems in a 
70year lifetime los said

human rights champion andrei d sakharovs bid for 
a seat in the new soviet legislature received a stunning boost after 
the soviet academy of sciences rejected most of the candidates on 
the officially backed slate 
the outcome means the academy will have to vote again reviving 
sakharovs chances for election to the congress of peoples 
deputies the academys leadership had nominated the entire slate 
thwarting his earlier effort 
members of the prestigious academy on tuesday approved just eight 
of the 23 candidates nominated for the 20 legislative seats alloted 
the academy the official tass news agency reported 
sakharov and other reformminded academicians had called for 
rejection of the oldguard candidates 
i think there will be a second round of elections predicted 
the physicist and nobel peace prize laureate who spent almost seven 
years in internal exile for criticizing the kremlins military drive 
into afghanistan 
tass said 1279 academy members and delegates from top soviet 
research institutes voted by secret ballot for three hours in 
moscows palace of youth on tuesday it gave no breakdown of the 
vote 
sakharovs effort to get on the initial slate was rejected by the 
academy leadership on jan 18 although he had been nominated by 55 
scientific institutions for a seat in the new 2250seat legislature 
prosakharov forces subsequently focused on convincing academy 
members to reject at least some of the candidates on the officially 
backed slate 
tass noted the controversy in its reporting on the results 
there was a clash of opinions as to whether the procedure of 
candidates nomination was democratic 
the agency said new candidates would be nominated in two weeks 
and new elections held after a period of campaigning 
it quoted vladimir kudryavtsev academy vice president as saying 
the elections showed the growth of democratization in the academy 
and made for more profound understanding between the leadership of 
the academy and broad scientific public 
the races for the congress of peoples deputies have been marked 
by a rare diversity of views and unprecedented public debate 
boris yeltsin the ousted moscow party boss turned populist 
reformer on tuesday said soviets should be able to freely elect 
candidates for all leadership posts including the presidency held 
by mikhail s gorbachev 
we need direct elections from top to bottom including for the 
presidency said yeltsin who is seeking a seat representing 
moscow in the new legislature the seat will be filled in nationwide 
elections sunday 
the communist party is guaranteed 100 seats in the legislature 
and yeltsin criticized it for avoiding contested races by nominating 
just 100 candidates he said the move is not the best example of 
democracy for our society 
yeltsin who was ousted as city party chief in 1987 for 
criticizing the slow pace of reforms campaigned tuesday in the 
heart of opponent yevgeny brakovs territory he spoke and answered 
questions for three hours in a conference hall at the giant zil 
factory brakov runs 
yeltsin was greeted warmly by the roughly 1000 people on hand 
workers outside the meeting hall spoke well of brakov but said 
yeltsin had more experience and that his support was strong among 
the 80000 workers at the giant conglomeration that produces 
limousines refrigerators and freezers and a variety of other 
durable goods 
yeltsins candidacy has been thust into the limelight by what he 
says is a campaign organized against him by the moscow party elite 
supporters have plastered campaign posters on walls all over the 
city 
the congress of peoples deputies which will meet only one day a 
year is to elect the countrys acting fulltime legislature from 
among its membership and choose the soviet president a post now 
held by mikhail s gorbachev 
a total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to public 
organizations like the academy of sciences and the communist party 
the other 1500 are for representatives of the 15 constituent 
soviet republics and their electoral districts those seats will be 
filled in sundays elecitons

us military officers are resisting 
congressional calls for a 30day suspension of training flights 
using nightvision goggles asserting the flights are getting safer 
and are essential to a roundtheclock fighting capability 
but members of the house armed services investigations 
subcommittee say they need to be convinced that the use of 
nightvision goggles has not been a factor in a rash of recent 
deadly crashes 
the debate over the goggles was aired tuesday in a hearing of the 
subcommittee in the immediate aftermath of a helicopter crash monday 
during training exercises in south korea nineteen marines were 
killed and 16 were injured in the second marine helicopter disaster 
in south korea in four days 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass the subcommittee chairman said 
43 servicemen were killed over the last year in four separate 
helicopter crashes during flights in which nightvision goggles were 
used 
he said an inquiry by the panel determined that over the past two 
years 27 of the most serious accidents or more than 50 percent of 
the total involved the use of nightvision goggles 
this steep upward trend is very very alarming mavroules 
said 
he and other subcommittee members said they doubt the safety of 
an early version of the nightvision goggles and are disturbed that 
many of them are still in use the chairman also questioned whether 
the initial flight training using the goggles is sufficient and 
whether one hour every 45 days is enough followup training 
the restricted field of vision limited depth perception 
inability to see certain obstacles and many other factors adversely 
impact upon the aviators ability to fly the aircraft mavroules 
said 
one witness veteran army flight instructor david e broadnax 
urged suspending night training using the goggles for 30 days and 
added i feel we should slow down for a moment at least pull over 
to the side of the road and take a critical look at what were 
doing 
but army maj gen ellis d parker commander of the us army 
aviation center at ft rucker ala said that training flights 
using nightvision goggles are relatively safe and getting safer 
the fact that you see more accidents during night training is 
because we are doing more night training he said we cant let 
our proficiency decay 
he said that the rate of serious accidents involving deaths and 
injuries dropped to 184 per 100000 flying hours in 1988 making 
this past year the safest year ever for army aviation 
between 1978 and feb 10 1989 there were 399 serious air 
accidents involving all causes day and night parker said of these 
108 or 27 percent of the total occurred during night hours even 
though night flights account for about 35 percent of all aviation 
training 
he said 40 of these accidents or about 10 percent of the total 
involved the use of nightvision goggles even though the goggles 
are used during most night flights 
in no cases as in zero percent have the goggles been blamed 
as the sole cause of the accident parker said 
but he acknowleged that 19 of the 40 accidents in which goggles 
had been used during night flight occurred in the last two years 
i dont think weve got a major problem parker asserted 
but mavroules told him forty of 108 is out of whack lets 
face up to it

thanks to an irs whistleblower the internal 
revenue service is dropping a policy that prohibited notifying some 
taxpayers who had overpaid the government 
the irs should collect the appropriate amount of tax no more 
and no less acting commissioner michael j murphy told reporters 
in disclosing the new policy he said the agency would issue a 
formal notice today telling taxpayers who had been victimized by the 
old policy as long as three years ago how they could apply for 
refunds 
furthermore said sen albert gore jr dtenn who discussed 
the issue in private for nearly an hour with murphy on tuesday the 
acting commissioner assured him there would be no reprisals against 
the irs employee who had publicly disclosed the old policy 
in fact he said this is the kind of employee the irs needs 
more of gore said 
linda johnson an examiner who has worked in the irs service 
center in memphis for four years disclosed the problem to gore in a 
private meeting several days ago she repeated the assertions in 
interviews last week insisting that she not be identified by name 
but eventually identified herself publicly 
i knew it was stealing from the taxpayers if we did not tell 
them when they did not claim their withholding ms johnson said 
murphy said the irs has no idea just how many taxpayers most of 
whom apparently were pensioners overpaid their taxes in 1985 and 
1986 and were not notified by the agency ms johnson said she knew 
of dozens of such cases in the memphis office usually involving 
overpayments of 100 to 1000 
the problem was discovered as part of the irss computerized 
program to catch people who fail to report some or all their income 
this involves comparing income statements w2 forms for wages and 
1099 forms for several other types of income with tax returns 
if that computer check finds some income has been reported by an 
employer bank or other payer but not by the earner examiners 
decide whether the taxpayer should be sent a form letter demanding 
more taxes plus interest and penalty 
but ms johnson said many taxpayers many of whom were receiving 
pension payments apparently were unaware that some tax had been 
withheld from their income and neglected to subtract withholdings 
when they calculated their taxes thus they overpaid 
when she and other employees discovered such a pattern in 1987 
while checking 1985 returns ms johnson said they were told that 
the irs manual prohibited notifying taxpayers of such errors when 
employees complained to superiors that the policy should be changed 
they were told it was up to taxpayers to find their own errors 
in addition to dropping the old policy murphy said the irs will 
make provisions for taxpayers who overpaid their 1985 and 1986 taxes 
to file amended returns and get any refund to which they are 
entitled under normal procedures the deadline for filing an 
amended 1985 return would be april 17 
murphy said the irs will examine whether that deadline can be 
extended 
should a taxpayer neglect to subtract withheld taxes when filing 
a return this year murphy said irs computers will detect the error 
and send out a notice murphy said

the navy ballistic missile that failed this 
week after its first underwater launch is among that rarest of new 
weapons most everyone thinks its needed and that the program has 
been well managed 
as recently as last november the general accounting office and 
rep les aspin dwis the chairman of the house armed services 
committee publicly lauded the trident 2 missile as the one major 
strategic weapon that was proceeding on schedule under sound 
management and within budget 
and unlike the b1b and b2 bombers and the mx and midgetman 
missiles the trident 2 has been embraced by congress as a necessary 
improvement to the nations nuclear arsenal 
while landbased missiles and bombers are susceptible to a 
firststrike attack the navys nuclear submarines are still 
considered immune to soviet detection and thus always ready to 
retaliate in the event of war 
the trident 2 is a new more lethal version of the weapon that 
now forms the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent the 
trident i missile went into service in 1979 offering a much greater 
range than its predecessor the poseidon missile 
that range of roughly 4600 miles in turn allowed us nuclear 
submarines to patrol a vast area of the worlds oceans and still 
remain close enough to strike the soviet union improving an already 
formidable underwater advantage 
the trident 2 is designed to offer something more not only 
greater range roughly 6000 miles but more importantly greater 
accuracy for the first time say defense sources the most 
invulnerable part of the us nuclear arsenal also will be accurate 
enough to threaten targets the soviet union has hardened to 
survive a war 
although accuracy figures for all nuclear missiles are 
classified published reports suggest the trident 2 is designed to 
strike within 400 feet or less of a target compared to about 1500 
feet for the trident i 
that almost matches the predicted accuracy of the landbased mx 
missile and is considered sufficient to destroy hardened targets 
some critics claim that will turn submarines into first strike 
weapons undermining the deterrent balance with the soviet union 
pentagon officials counter that absent any arms control agreement 
dealing with submarine weapons the trident 2 is needed because it 
is the soviets who have built the largest arsenal of firststrike 
weapons 
despite two previous failures in the first 19 tests of the 
trident 2 navy officials have expressed pleasure over the general 
progress in developing the missile 
on tuesday the service said in a statement it was 
disappointed with the latest failure but added it is through 
this type of developmental test program that you iron out problems 
the navy said it is still planning to conduct eight more 
seabased test launches and that it is premature to suggest the 
missile wouldnt be ready for its scheduled first deployment in 
december 1989 
the trident i missile that now forms the heart of the navys 
nuclear arsenal experienced similar test failures and but was 
deployed on schedule the service added

the agriculture department says more than 80 
percent of the thousands of applications from farmers seeking 
special debt relief from the farmers home administration have been 
processed 
every completed application will be processed in time for 
farmers to put their spring crop in the ground neal sox johnson 
the fmhas acting administrator said tuesday 
johnson added that even those whose applications are incomplete 
will be able to farm this year because of expanded appeal rights 
the agricultural credit act of 1987 required fmha to tell 
borrowers who were more than 180 days delinquent about the various 
liberalized debt servicing options available under the law 
by law borrowers had 45 days to respond and furnish certain 
financial and production information the agency than had 60 days in 
which to obtain additional information and process the applications 
in most cases that period ended march 10 
more than 66000 notices to delinquent borrowers were sent out 
johnson said more than 28000 completed applications were received 
and more than 23000 of those have been processed 
johnson said the agency will continue working overtime and 
weekends to complete processing of the remaining 5000 
applications

a congressional panel is urging impeachment of 
us district judge walter l nixon of mississippi who is fighting 
to return to the bench after he completes a fiveyear perjury 
sentence 
under our constitution a federal judge holds life tenure and 
remains in office until congress says otherwise chairman don 
edwards dcalif said tuesday as his house judiciary subcommittee 
unanimously called for impeachment 
the panel said in its articles of impeachment that nixon lied to 
a federal grand jury fbi agents and prosecutors and brought 
disrepute on the federal courts 
the case now goes before the full judiciary committee which will 
decide whether to send the case to the full house 
impeachment by the house however would not remove nixon from 
the district court bench it would take conviction by the senate to 
take away his office and his 89500 annual salary 
edwards said it seems outrageous that a federal judge who has 
not heard cases for 3 12 years who has been convicted by a jury 
of his peers of perjury and has been sentenced may continue to 
collect his judicial salary and can expect to return to the bench 
after his sentence is completed 
but that he acknowledged is precisely what could happen unless 
nixon were impeached by the house and convicted by the senate 
the senate currently is trying district judge alcee l hastings 
of miami who was impeached by the house last august unlike nixon 
he was acquitted of criminal charges in a 1983 trial 
nixon was convicted in february 1986 and lost a round of appeals 
in the last such battle in 1986 district judge harry claiborne 
of nevada was removed from the bench after he had been sent to 
prison for official corruption 
the threecount articles of impeachment say nixon lied on july 
18 1984 in telling a federal grand jury in hattiesburg that the 
forrest county miss district attorney never discussed with him a 
narcotics case involving drew fairchild the son of wealthy 
contractor wiley fairchild 
the grand jury had been empaneled to investigate nixons business 
relationship with fairchild and the handling of the case against the 
son 
after entering into an oil and gas investment with wiley 
fairchild judge nixon conversed with wiley fairchild and 
forrest county district attorney paul holmes concerning the state 
criminal drug conspiracy prosecution of drew fairchild the 
articles said they said that afterward nixon concealed these 
conversations 
nixon attorney david stewart issued a statement after the panels 
session saying that because walter nixon is in prison some may 
assume that he should be removed from the federal judiciary 
but that assumption is wrong the statement said there is 
no credible evidence that judge nixon has done anything to warrant 
impeachment and no impeachment articles should be approved by the 
house 
judge nixon is in prison because he as a federal judge was 
targeted for prosecution was subjected to a sensationalized 
investigation and finally was convicted after an unfair trial 
stewart said

designing a dog kennel building a scale model 
of the solar system and calculating a statistical profile of the 
average student are among the exercises recommended in a new 
attempt to upgrade math teaching 
the 54 curriculum and evaluation standards announced tuesday by 
the national council of teachers of mathematics aim to make sure 
americas students can explore and reason as well as add and 
subtract 
in classrooms following the new plan students would be exposed 
to less rote memorization more computers and calculators and 
cooperative teamwork instead of oneonone competition the idea is 
to view math as a daily human activity and solve problems related to 
real life 
we look at a decade of work ahead of us in making these 
changes nctm president shirley frye said at a news conference at 
which the council released its 272page twoyear effort she said 
videotapes publications and trained leaders will encourage teachers 
to put the standards into practice 
the national education association and the american federation of 
teachers praised the new standards and urged their members to use 
them in their classrooms 
education secretary lauro cavazos was equally supportive the 
standards are valuable guidelines for a revised math curriculum 
that captures students interest and at the same time builds a solid 
foundation of knowledge he said in a statement 
the new math teaching standards build on the premise borne out 
by recent studies that american children do well in international 
comparisons of basic arithmetical skills but poorly when it comes to 
applying mathematical principles 
only about onehalf of american 17yearolds can say whether 87 
percent of 10 is less than 10 greater than 10 or equal to 10 
said john dossey chairman of nctms standards implementation 
commission only about half can figure out how much carpet is needed 
to cover a floor or calculate the probability of a simple event he 
said 
generally the standards seek to ensure that students value math 
become confident in their abilities learn to solve problems and 
learn to communicate and to reason mathematically they set specific 
goals and expectations for students and not only those headed for 
phds 
applied mathematics is not just for a couple of geniuses in the 
country said sally ride a stanford university physicist and 
former astronaut who appeared at the news conference 
in developing the standards educators and mathematicians kept in 
mind that many students find math deadeningly dull they concluded 
that rote practice and drills should not be abandoned but shouldnt 
dominate the classroom either 
the group recommends that every student at every level have 
access to calculators and computers calling them fast pencils 
that allow students to expand on their basic skills it also calls 
for group activities that better reflect the way problems are solved 
at work and in the community than the isolation and competition 
found in many traditional math classes 
the guidelines stress that math must be put in the context of 
everyday life sample problems involve grocery shopping motorcycle 
races used car purchases savings accounts pulse rates and taste 
tests among other things 
in addition to curriculum guidelines thegroup outlined 
evaluation techniques designed to make sure concepts are understood 
frye cited the example of a student asked the perimeter of a 
sixsided figure a student could add the numbers on each side and 
get the right answer 23 without knowing what perimeter means she 
said but a student told he has 23 yards of fencing to draw a 
sixsided fence would have to demonstrate understanding of the 
concept in order to solve the problem

from horseshoes and tennis on the white house 
grounds to frequent side trips to do stuff george bush two 
months after his inauguration still displays obvious glee in just 
being president 
its wonderful get to work quicker bush told a reporter who 
asked if he shared what former president reagan called the 
occasional frustration of living over the store 
for the nations 41st president the thrill still hasnt worn off 
from where we are standing most of the landmarks of this town 
are almost a stones throw away he marveled the other day in a 
speech on the south lawn thats one of the beautiful things that 
barbara and i have rediscovered but discovered principally from 
living in the quarters above here 
and if bushs administration is adrift or off to a slow start as 
some critics suggest youd have trouble telling it from the 
schedule he keeps 
in eight weeks hes traveled to canada japan china south 
korea virginia south carolina maine new hampshire missouri new 
york texas and colorado delaware and pennsylvania 
he presented his revision of president reagans budget to a joint 
session of congress and met repeatedly with congressional leaders to 
prod the process along proposed a sweeping savingsandloan rescue 
plan endured the controversy over the john tower nomination became 
involved in controversies ranging from assault weapons to tainted 
grapes and japanese jets 
he also watched over the birth of six presidential pups and met 
with reporters in questionandanswer sessions a dozen times 
he routinely puts in 12hour days in the oval office and has made 
frequent forays from the white house to church to restaurants to 
the theater to give speeches around town 
theres no at least at this juncture any confinement 
you move and go out and do stuff and the secret service are very 
you know they do their job but theyre flexible in approach if you 
want to go someplace he said 
bush also tries to take setbacks in stride with a dose of 
selfdeprecating humor asked at a news conference about the 
controversy surrounding tower his first nominee for defense 
secretary he said what controversy 
and as always bush rejoices in athletics from discussing his 
running habits with chinese leader deng xiaoping to interrupting a 
girls soccer game in colorado springs last week to do a few laps 
around the track send me a bill he told a girl who tried to 
hit him for the 2 admission charge 
he claims a lingering flu in february cut down on his running 
making him a little overweight but i really feel good 
bush who once called horseshoes the national pastime even 
had a horseshoe pit dug on the white house grounds and plans a 
formal dedication of it on april 1 
we now refer to it as the court the horseshoe pitching 
court he said claiming he plans a very big gala opening with 
horseshoe pitchers from across the country coming some of the very 
best 
bush also plays tennis at the white house frequently and works 
out on a stationary bike and a treadmill 
so i am excited we have a lot of events lots going on 
bush has noticed other things from his white house windows 
besides the gleaming monuments for instance the homeless he says 
he can see huddled in rags outside the gates 
at the same time bush sometimes shows he hasnt lost the 
nonchalance of a lifestyle of privilege and wealth 
discussing next weeks easter egg roll on the white house lawn 
bush expressed amazement that families wait hours to get onto the 
grounds to get in there yes well i havent seen the grass 
roots side of it i just kind of walk down the center aisle

back in the 1870s a destructive insect known 
as the cottony cushion scale arrived on the west coast from 
australia and began sucking on californias fledgling citrus crops 
a decade or so later the agriculture department imported some 
vedalia beetles or australian ladybugs natural enemies of the 
scale in australia which didnt have problems with the cottony 
cushion scale 
within months the scale was vanquished and california went on to 
become famous for groves of oranges lemons and other citrus 
its been shipped around the world and its done a good job 
wherever theres been cottony cushion scale says jack r coulson 
of the departments agricultural research service talking about the 
beetle 
scale pests generally have membranes or scalelike coverings he 
said in a telephone interview they usually remain in one place 
while attacking branches and stems the cottony cushion scale is 
sort of fuzzy looking hence its name 
coulson who is director of his agencys biological control 
documentation center is one of many involved in usdas 100th 
anniversary of the saving of californias citrus industry by the 
deliberate introduction of a natural enemy to pests the vedalia 
beetle 
nowadays such use of predators parasites and disease organisms 
to fight unwanted pests is called biological control 
festivities at the usdas administration building through 
thursday include exhibits of live insects and fish including one 
that gobbles up unwanted hydrilla vegetation in streams and 
irrigation ditches 
another success also in california involved a colorful but 
poisonous weed called st johnswort which in humboldt county in 
1945 literally held this prime grazing land in its grasp wrote 
lloyd a andres of usdas research center in albany calif in a 
report several years ago 
the university of california and usda introduced a shiny 
bluegreen beetle which in europe and australia had fed exclusively 
on st johnswort or closely related plants by 1950 the weed in 
california was well on its way to being controlled andres said 
but the pests and their natural enemies must be matched up 
accurately he said for example early shipments of mites aceria 
chondrilla juncea to control rush skeletonweed failed to take 
hold the mites from greece were not compatible with the us 
weed a second shipment of mites from italy readily established 
themselves 
in another case a small parasite from france was introduced in 
california to control the the walnut aphid established in coastal 
areas but failed in the warmer interior valleys so aphids were 
imported from iran where the climate more closely resembled that of 
the interior california areas 
one of the most promising of todays biological controls involves 
half a dozen species of parasitic wasps from europe and asia to 
combat the alfalfa weevil between 1981 and 1988 nearly 20 million 
of the beneficial wasps were released at thousands of locations 
department experts say the wasps already have significantly 
reduced the amount of chemical pesticides used to control alfalfa 
weevils

the american farm bureau federation says 
legislation to raise federal minimum wage levels would eliminate 
jobs increase unemployment and raise the cost of food to consumers 
federation president dean kleckner said last week in a letter to 
congress that the proposed wage increase would inevitably produce 
upward pressure on all wages paid and that will increase prices of 
agricultural products 
house and senate labor committees have approved similar versions 
raising the federal minimum wage to 465 per hour from 335 
currently the house bill would raise the the minimum in 40cent 
increments over two years beginning on jan 1 1990 the senate 
version would raise it over three years 
kleckner said the higher minimum would have a serious impact 
on agricultural employment where fourfifths of the hired workers 
are in seasonal jobs and were the piecerate system of wages is 
common 
if piece rates have to be increased substantially to make it 
possible for lessskilled lessexperienced workers to earn the new 
minimum farmers will seek to find workers with greater skills and 
experience and reduce the number of workers hired he said

five top fish and wildlife officials were 
questioned behind closed doors on capitol hill about allegations the 
agencys former chief warned sen phil gramm his maryland farm was 
being watched for alleged illegal hunting practices 
our goal is to ensure that our fish and wildlife laws are 
enforced equally and fairly against all citizens and that fish and 
wildlife service employees are able to carry out their 
responsibilities without fear of inappropriate political 
interference rep gerry e studds dmass said tuesday before 
closing the hearing of his house merchant marine and fisheries 
subcommittee 
among those questioned during the 2hour executive session was 
frank dunkle who earlier this month stepped down as director of the 
agency 
dunkle and gramm a texas republican have denied any 
inappropriate behavior claiming that the congressional 
investigation is politically motivated by studds 
the controversy was triggered by a letter from nathaniel p reed 
an assistant interior secretary in the nixon and ford 
administrations who said he had heard the allegations about dunkle 
last summer 
in a feb 22 letter to studds reed said dunkle confirmed to him 
during a telephone conversation that he had tipped off gramm that 
his eastern shore farm was under surveillance by federal wildlife 
officials who suspected that birds were being baited there for 
hunting 
baiting the practice of spreading food to lure waterfowl within 
shooting range is prohibited 
fish and wildlife spokesmen said tuesday that dunkle and the 
other officials who testified would not comment 
gramm has vehemently denied the allegations 
no such conversation as described by congressman studds has 
occurred and as far as the issue of baiting is concerned he 
gramm does not hunt the land said gramm spokesman larry neal 
asked if there had been any contact between fish and wildlife and 
the senator neal said the information was not transmitted 
we dont know mr reed the senators spokesman added 
studds aides said gramm was invited by the subcommittee last 
week to testify at tuesdays hearing but neal said the senator 
received less than 24 hours notice he was out of town tuesday 
the subcommittee staff has received sworn affidavits from a 
variety of sources including reed but not gramm and will report 
its findings to the panel an aide said

floating prison barges in the potomac river are 
among the options being considered by drug czar william j bennett 
to combat the rampant drugrelated violence that has made washington 
the nations murder capital 
other options under consideration include evicting convicted drug 
dealers from public housing and creation of a 24hour drug court 
similar to one being used in new york an aide to bennett said 
tuesday speaking on condition of anonymity 
but about the only decision bennetts office has made so far on 
dozens of possibilities is that federal troops most likely wont be 
taking on police duties 
its not something that is in the works bennett said tuesday 
at a drug conference in paradise valley ariz its certainly 
nothing that weve considered as a live option 
said the aide the militarys just not meant to be part and 
parcel of civilian arrest troops they can help out and train or 
work with specialty equipment but not on the streets 
bennett is considering whether to designate the district of 
columbia as the nations first highintensity drugtrafficking 
area that decision should be made in the next two weeks the aide 
said 
such a designation which was included in the drug bill passed by 
congress last year that created the office of national drug control 
policy headed by bennett would allow him to allocate federal 
personnel and cash to combat the problem 
the district of columbia became the nations murder capital with 
372 slayings last year the highest per capita rate in the country 
so far this year there have been 119 murders compared with 73 at 
this time in 1988 police said tuesday 
the no 1 thing were thinking about is expanded prison space 
to put more people away for longer periods the aide said noting 
that a dozen people in bennetts office are assessing what steps 
should be taken were looking at vast range of options 
one is to use military bases as prisons were also thinking 
about boats putting prisoners on barges in the river 
other ideas under consideration are working with the department 
of housing and urban development to attain drugfree public housing 
and getting evictions of convicted dope dealers and those in crack 
houses working with the labor department trade associations and 
unions toward drugfree workplaces and working with the health and 
human services department to get increased treatment facilities 
available to drug users 
in addition to possible creation of a 24hour drug court 
bennetts office also is looking at the possibility of adding more 
judges and prosecutors the aide said 
while the office wants better coordination between federal law 
enforcement officials and local police it would not be 
realistic to reassign drug enforcement administration or fbi 
agents from field offices to washington the aide said 
anything attempted for washington would be viewed by bennetts 
office as how it would fit in as a demonstration program a model 
program said the aide were trying to keep our eye on the 
ball and the ball is the overall national strategy 
the national plan is due sept 9 
as the office assesses what options to try it is attempting to 
define some realistic goals so we have some measures of success or 
failure before we go into this 
were trying to stop the carnage on the streets but do you 
measure it by lack of deaths or tonnage of drugs confiscated 
people arrested how do you define it

federal officials believe that the fatal 
bombing of pan am flight 103 required aid from a foreign government 
because of the complex preparations that had to have been involved 
a top state department official says 
we dont believe terrorist organizations can pull off a pan am 
103 without state support from somewhere clayton e mcmanaway 
jr the departments associate coordinator for counterterrorism 
told congress tuesday 
mcmanaway testified to the house aviation subcommittee which was 
holding a hearing on aviation security he did not provide the 
lawmakers with further details 
congress has hold several hearings on the security implications 
of the dec 21 explosion aboard the jetliner which killed 270 
people as it soared over scotland authorities have said they 
believe a bomb had been disguised as a radiocassette player and 
placed in checked luggage 
mcmanaway told a reporter after his testimony that the network of 
helpers false passports and other assistance that would have been 
needed by the bomber can be provided by a government he would not 
comment however when asked whether investigators have uncovered 
evidence indicating the involvement of a hostile power in the flight 
103 incident 
weve drawn no conclusions he said 
when asked which nations might engage in statesponsored 
terrorism he named the six countries that the state department has 
listed in the past as participating in such acts libya syria 
north korea cuba iran and the peoples democratic republic of 
yemen 
on feb 1 cbs news cited unnamed sources deep within 
international terrorist movements as linking syria and libya to 
the pan am explosion 
also at tuesdays hearing the us airline industry urged the 
government to install 67 million worth of sophisticated explosives 
detection equipment at 45 airports in europe the middle east and 
the far east 
the major threat is sabotage and the major threat is 
overseas said richard f lally assistant vice president of 
security for the air transport association 
at an earlier news conference relatives of the disasters 
victims asked the federal aviation administration to tighten 
security regulations for airlines 
they called for a requirement that airlines notify passengers of 
credible terrorism threats and another rule that would upgrade 
airline searches of baggage 
the government has acknowledged receiving general indications of 
potential terrorist activity in europe in the weeks before the 
flight 103 explosion but it never issued a public warning 
federal officials have said that when they receive specific 
believable threats they would only warn the public if the airline 
and local authorities involved take insufficient steps to thwart the 
terrorists

a former bricklayer was put to death by 
lethal injection early wednesday for killing a man 11 years ago by 
smashing his head in with the butt of a shotgun 
leon rutherford king 44 was pronounced dead at 1227 am 
i appreciate what you did for me he told five friends 
witnessing the execution as lethal liquid was injected into his 
veins 
kings execution for the 1978 slaying of michael clayton 
underwood 26 came about two hours after the us supreme court 
denied the last of three emergency requests for a stay 
he was the third person executed this year and the 107th since 
the supreme court restored the death penalty in 1976 he was the 
30th inmate to be put to death in texas which has executed more 
people than any other state 
king was convicted and sentenced to death twice in underwoods 
slaying 
attorneys for king who had prior convictions for burglary 
forgery and drug possession had contended in appeals that his 
crimes stemmed from brain damage 
the case went to the supreme court after appeals were rejected 
tuesday by a federal judge in houston and the 5th us circuit court 
of appeals 
the nations highest court voted 72 72 and 54 respectively 
against the requests for a stay with justices william j brennan 
and thurgood marshall who oppose the death penalty in all 
circumstances voting to spare king each time justices john paul 
stevens and harry a blackmun joined them in the final vote 
underwood was slain after he and his 19yearold girlfriend were 
abducted at gunpoint from a houston nightclub and taken to a remote 
area where he was beaten to death and the young woman was forced to 
watch according to court records 
dr ethel erickson the medical examiner who performed the 
autopsy on underwood said the damage to underwoods head was like 
what one would suffer if run down by a tractortrailer 
king and an accomplice allen ray carter became enraged because 
the abducted couple were carrying only 1150 authorities said 
after underwood was killed the woman was repeatedly raped and 
sodomized 
he continued to hit him the woman said describing kings 
attack on underwood i could hear it it sounded like something 
just kept hitting the ground like woodchopping eight or nine 
times 
carter who could not be sentenced to death because he was only 
16 at the time of the crime is serving a life prison term 
the woman in the king case whose name has been withheld 
suffered psychological trauma and was institutionalized for a time 
said doug shaver who was an assistant prosecutor in the king trial 
she eventually moved away from texas and got married 
when kings first conviction was overturned the woman had to 
return to houston to testify again her husband unaware of her 
earlier ordeal divorced her shaver said 
the woman married again but her second husband was murdered in a 
service station shooting shaver said 
king an 11thgrade dropout who worked as a bricklayer had 
refused to be interviewed by reporters in the weeks preceding his 
death date

a retired librarian who thinks its never 
too late to turn the page on an embarrassing event in his familys 
past has returned three library books nearly 75 years after his 
mother checked them out 
edward macconomy jr of virginia said he wanted to clear the 
family name by returning the books to the jackson public library 
the books now have cracking bindings and fragile pages library 
director david l leamon said they are the longest overdue books 
hes ever seen returned library officials decided not to fine 
macconomy 
its nice to know that guilt is still alive and well imagine 
still interested in clearing the family name after all these 
years leamon said he could have just tossed those books into 
the trash but instead he took the time to add a little humor to 
our day 
macconony 72 worked at the library of congress in washington 
dc from 1963 until his retirement in 1985 he lives in 
alexandria va 
in a letter to the jackson district library dated feb 21 he 
said his mother frances must have inadvertently taken the three 
books when she moved from jackson to detroit in 1914 after she 
married 
when she died in 1974 the contents of her library were just 
sort of boxed up and put to one side macconomy said of his 
mother it doesnt seem very logical but i never got to the 
material to do anything with it or about it until just a few weeks 
ago 
i thought well they dont belong to her and they dont belong 
to me i better send them back 
the books were sir walter scotts quentin durward kate 
douglas wiggins the birds xmas carol and louisa may alcotts

a 25yearold municipal judge who claims to 
be the youngest jurist in the country says his recent appointment to 
the bench is only fitting for someone whos always wanted to make 
the law his life 
even when i was young i just always had it in my mind that i 
wanted to be an attorney said vince gurrera 
when you fill out those little forms what do you want to be 
when you grow up i always put attorney if you look at my 
fourthgrade one attorney 
the 1987 graduate of west virginia universitys college of law 
was appointed to the bench recently by weirton mayor edwin bowman to 
fill a vacancy 
i guess what influenced me most in wanting to go into the legal 
profession was watching television shows that deal with 
lawyers gurrera said adding that one of his favorite shows was 
perry mason 
another influence was an early brush with the law he said 
probably when i was five years old i tried to steal a deck of 
cards from kroger i was with my grandmother the judge said i 
gave the cards to the clerk and she let me go 
it embarrassed me though gurrera said ever since then 
ive taken a real hard stand against shoplifting

congress needs to stop manufacturers from 
setting retail prices because courts recently have gutted the 
antitrust prohibitions against the practice known as vertical 
pricefixing a lawyer told a house panel 
for 78 years the supreme court has regarded vertical 
pricefixing as so anticompetitive that it is automatically illegal 
that is illegal per se lawyer gary mcgowan testified 
tuesday and congress has recognized the evils of vertical 
pricefixing and the need to maintain the per se rule against it 
however two court decisions monsanto v sprayrite in 1984 and 
business electronics v sharp electronics last year have almost 
gutted the per se rule mcgowan told the house judiciary 
subcommittee on economic and commercial law mcgowan of the houston 
firm susman godfrey amp mcgowan represented the plaintiffs in the 
sharp case 
the subcommittee is considering legislation that would reinstate 
the prohibition against vertical pricefixing 
vertical pricefixing can take several forms the most blatant of 
which is when a manufacturer and one or more of its dealers agree 
directly on specific prices to be charged by the dealers more 
typically it occurs when one dealer complains to the manufacturer 
about another dealers price levels and the manufacturer goes to 
the second dealer and threatens to cut him off if he doesnt raise 
his prices 
new york attorney general robert abrams complained the justice 
department has not instituted any vertical pricefixing cases in 
eight years while the state attorneys general settled one such case 
against panasonic corp and have collaborated in prosecuting 
others 
in the panasonic case settled in january the company returned 
some 16 million to consumers for allegedly threatening to cut off 
retailers who would not charge their list price 
since it is clear that congress as the policymaker the supreme 
court as interpreter and the state attorneys general as the 
consumers representatives have all condemned vertical pricefixing 
standards which effectively deter and punish this practice are 
clearly called for abrams said 
rep jack brooks dtexas chairman of the subcommittee agreed 
with many of the complaints outlined tuesday 
through a disquieting combination of inaction and public 
statements the justice department has shown its unmistakable 
intention to turn its back on the consumer and americanstyle 
competition in favor of an economic system where fewer and fewer 
players are permitted to compete in the marketplace brooks said

advocates on both sides are divided over 
whether supreme court decisions to uphold drug and alcohol tests for 
some sensitive government and safetyrelated jobs paves the way for 
more sweeping random testing 
the decisions tuesday the courts first on such tests are being 
welcomed by bush administration officials who say they are an 
important step toward a drugfree workplace 
civil libertarians meanwhile denounced the rulings as an 
erosion of privacy rights and union leaders were split over their 
likely impact 
we think this represents a significant first step in validating 
what has been proved to be a useful program of deterrence of drug 
abuse said attorney general dick thornburgh 
he declined to say whether he thinks broader random testing 
would meet with the high courts approval 
all of these cases are going to rise or fall on their 
particular facts and will depend upon how carefully the program is 
structured thornburgh said 
the justices by a 72 vote upheld federal regulations forcing 
railroad workers involved in accidents to undergo blood and urine 
tests by a separate 54 vote the court ruled that the us customs 
service can order urine tests for employees seeking drugenforcement 
jobs or positions that require they carry firearms 
the court ordered further lower court hearings to determine 
whether the customs service rules also should apply to workers with 
access to classified information 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court in both cases 
said such tests do not violate workers privacy rights even though 
they are conducted without a court warrant or a suspicion that an 
individual is using drugs or alcohol 
the decisions will affect other drug and alcohol testing programs 
conducted by federal state and local governments and they appear 
to sanction tests for those in such sensitive jobs as police officer 
or firefighter 
but labor leaders said it is unclear whether the justices would 
uphold random testing for millions of other workers 
larry mann a lawyer for the railway workers said the sweep of 
the rulings is quite profound he asked whats to prohibit 
the government from now imposing regulations on every person caught 
speeding or every person in an auto accident 
robert tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union which represents customs workers said he is disappointed but 
added i believe that in cases outside of this narrow issue of 
public safety we are going to see continued wins for public 
employees 
we do not believe that these cases are controlling on the issue 
of random testing said joe goldberg an attorney for the american 
federation of government employees 
jim reiter a spokesman for the association of american 
railroads praised the rulings but cautioned we still think the 
true deterrent is random testing 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion in the railway 
workers case said the court was bowing to momentary public pressure 
the majoritys acceptance of dragnet blood and urine testing 
ensures that the first and worst casualty of the war on drugs will 
be the precious liberties of our citizens he said 
the american civil liberties union agreed saying the sweeping 
language of the majority opinion in the railroad case appears to 
legitimize such mandatory testing in any area of employment that the 
government claims authority to regulate for safetyrelated 
reasons 
still pending in the lower courts are various challenges to an 
executive order issued by former president reagan in 1986 for 
federal agencies to adopt drugtesting programs 
while tuesdays rulings do not directly affect most private 
employment they likely will encourage private employers who impose 
or plan to impose such tests 
if anything there is less protection for workers in private jobs 
because the constitutions privacy guarantees generally restrict 
only actions by government officials 
onthejob drug tests are becoming increasingly commonplace 
particularly for the biggest corporations a gallup survey last year 
found that 28 percent of the nations largest corporations use the 
tests to screen job applicants and that the figure is likely to 
increase

wednesday while the us dollar also slipped against the japanese 
yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which on monday

another 21156 points or 067 percent to finish trading at 
3144324 the index gained a moderate 12907 points shortly after 
the start of morning trading but began to decline by midmorning 
the dollar closed at 13140 down 052 yen from its 13192yen 
close on monday the last trading day before tuesdays national 
holiday the currency started at 13118 yen and moved in a range 
between 13111 yen and 13143 yen 
the us currency started off lower in tokyo to adjust to levels 
in new york overnight where it finished at 13128 yen said a 
dealer with the bank of tokyo 
a 04 percent rise in the us consumer price index for february 
released tuesday discouraged dollarbuying interest by us 
investors the dealer said anonymously adding that the 
lowerthanexpected inflation rate lessened expectations for 
interest rate hikes in january the index grew by 06 percent 
the dollaryen rate remained steady in tokyo because investors 
were adjusting their dollar positions said another dealer with a 
commercial bank in tokyo also speaking on condition of anonymity 
concern over higher us interest rates on a longterm basis and 
maintaining steady oil prices has made investors reluctant to sell 
dollars he said 
bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said wednesday the dollar 
and crude oil prices were unlikely to keep rising and indicated the 
central bank would closely monitor their movements according to the 
economic planning agency 
meanwhile stock prices fell as investors stepped off to the 
sidelines in the absence of any incentives to buy said kenji 
ishizuka a trader with daiwa securities in tokyo 
a variety of issues were traded but dealers were reluctant to 
make major moves mainly due to the approach of yearend account 
settlements he added the japanese business year ends march 31 
the moderate rise in the us consumer price index eased japanese 
investors concerns for inflation in the united states but there was 
still some anxiety over the future of oil prices and higher interest 
rates traders said 
stock and currency exchange markets in japan were closed tuesday 
for the spring equinox national holiday

this years budget deficit is running slightly 
larger than last years and about in line with expectations for a 
bigger shortfall due in part to rising interest expenses and 
spending to aid the troubled savings and loan industry 
the treasury department reported tuesday that for the first five 
months of the 1989 fiscal year which began oct 1 the deficit was 
9265 billion up from the 9033 billion gap at the comparable 
time a year earlier 
in february the deficit was 2787 billion up from 2403 
billion in february a year ago as growth in spending outpaced 
increases in revenues 
the government took in 6198 billion last month up 27 percent 
from february a year ago but spending rose 65 percent from 
february 1988 to 8985 billion last month 
william v sullivan senior vice president for dean witter 
reynolds inc in new york said that even with the widening of the 
deficit last month the governments shortfall still is running 
close to expectations for this fiscal year 
its a little bit too early to tell whether this represents a 
sustained trend toward deterioration in the budget he said 
an upswing in tax revenues which have been bolstered by the 
strong economy is one reason the deficit has not grown more as 
payments on the public debt rise as interest rates increase 
sullivan said 
the bush administration is projecting the deficit for all of 
fiscal 1989 will be 1637 billion up 55 percent from last years 
shortfall of 1551 billion the expected increase in part is 
attributed to costs associated with higher interest rates and the 
governments assistance to the troubled savings and loan industry 
we admit that there are forces in place that could point toward 
some deterioration sullivan said but keep an eye on the 
revenue side of the ledger that may prevent the ultimate 
deterioration from being as high as it otherwise would be 
the government had run a 28 billion surplus in january a month 
in which spending generally is lower and receipts are high due to 
the payment of estimated quarterly taxes 
the largest government spending category in february was the 
military with other areas of big expense including social security 
other programs in the department of health and human services 
interest on the national debt and farm subsidies 
military spending last month totaled 225 billion and reached 
1191 billion so far this fiscal year up 22 percent from the pace 
at this time a year earlier 
spending on social security amounted to 19 billion last month 
and 916 billion for the first five months of fiscal 1989 up 57 
percent from a year earlier 
interest on the national debt cost 163 billion in february and 
has totaled 1005 billion so far this fiscal year up 107 percent 
health and human services programs other than social security 
cost 133 billion last month and 667 billion so far in fiscal 
1989 up 53 percent 
spending by the agriculture department last month was 42 
billion and reached 248 billion so far this year up 14 percent 
from a year earlier

brandon stoddard who helped pull abc out of 
last place in the ratings is leaving as the networks chief 
programming executive saying the job was about as enjoyable as a 
trip to the dentist 
i was not an overwhelming fan of this job stoddard said 
tuesday a root canal is a little more fun than this 
the secondplace network which still trails nbc by a wide margin 
on the ac nielsen co charts said it did not yet have a successor 
for stoddard as president of abc entertainment stoddard had held 
the spot since 1985 
stoddard who joined the network in 1970 and helped move abc past 
cbs in the ratings race during the last three years will become 
president of a new untitled production unit which will supply abc 
with series movies and miniseries 
this is a great innovation for us thomas murphy chairman 
and chief executive of capital citiesabc inc said of the new 
production enterprise in a statement he called the production 
company part of a plan which moves the network into the 1990s 
among the shows that came to the abc schedule during stoddards 
tenure were perfect strangers the wonder years 
thirtysomething hooperman and roseanne 
stoddards programming philosophy for the most part aimed to 
bring quality shows to a network best known in recent years for 
charlies angels the love boat and threes company in 
last years emmy awards abc collected 21 trophies more than both 
nbc and cbs 
before serving as president of abc entertainment stoddard was 
instrumental in the production of abcs roots the thorn 
birds the winds of war and rich man poor man stoddard 
also approved the production of the somewhat troubled miniseries 
war and remembrance the most expensive television show ever 
produced 
war and remembrance which premiered in november concludes 
in may 
the new production operation will encompass the current abc 
circle films organization 
i felt the network had reached a position where it had 
accomplished a couple of things i wanted it to do stoddard said 
there is a real direction for the network in terms of the kind of 
programming we were doing and secondly we have established some 
building blocks in the network shedule 
one abc executive who requested anonymity speculated that 
stoddard was eased out of his job because abcs onehour dramas have 
failed at an alarming rate 
stoddard would only acknowledge that his resignation came at an 
unusual time in the middle of a yettobe completed season 
even though abcs bluecollar situation comedy roseanne has 
been the nations most popular show for the last two weeks a number 
of abc drama series have floundered 
in the most recent ratings released tuesday mission 
impossible was no 61 dynasty was no 62 man called hawk 
was no 67 heartbeat was no 72 and murphys law was no 74 
in the current television season ending next month nbc leads

the nuclear regulatory commission says it has 
made vast improvements in nuclear safety in the decade since the 
three mile island accident and a scathing report on the agency by a 
presidential commission 
the new report prepared by the nrc staff and released tuesday 
reviews all of the recommendations contained in the october 1979 
report of president carters commission on the three mile island 
nuclear accident 
training equipment and maintenance at nuclear power plants 
have been upgraded the report said emergency planning has been 
enhanced noteworthy progress has been achieved in improving the 
margin of safety inherent in commercial nuclear power reactors 
the 1979 panel headed by computer scientist john kemeny 
recommended seven months after the march 28 accident that the nrc be 
replaced with a more efficient agency under the executive branch 
headed by a single administrator 
the panel said the state and federal emergency response to the 
tmi accident was disorganized and called for increased training of 
nuclear plant operators one panelist 1988 presidential candidate 
bruce babbitt said at the time that the nrc was a debating 
society that was headless 
the nrc responded to the panels report in late 1979 kemeny 
required no followup but nrc chairman lando zech requested one 
anyway because he was interested in compiling a report on what has 
been done in the last 10 years in the areas cited nrc spokesman 
joe fouchard said tuesday 
in a statement tuesday zech cited declines since 1979 in the 
number of emergency operating events per reactor in the number 
of unplanned plant shutdowns and in the amount of radiation exposure 
to plant personnel 
but washington attorney joanne doroshow citing figures compiled 
by ralph naders public citizens critical mass energy project said 
in a recent report that a record 104458 workers were exposed to 
measurable doses of radiation from commercial reactors in 1987 that 
compares with 98162 in 1984 she said 
the nrc uses a different measure of radiation exposure the 
agency says exposure calculated by manrem has dropped from 
714 manrem in 1984 to 425 in 1987 
manrem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of 
people for example when 100 people receive an average exposure of 
001 rem that would result in a figure of 1 manrem 
public citizen also said there were 430 emergency shutdowns at 
us plants in 1987 the nrc says the number of unplanned shutdowns 
has dropped from 524 per reactor in 1984 to 324 in 1987 when 109 
plants were operating 
since the accident the nrc has established emergency planning 
requirements for all reactors state and local authorities have 
upgraded emergency plans equipment and training and participate 
with licensees in biennial response exercises tuesdays nrc 
report said 
but emergency planning remains a controversial issue 
for example massachusetts officials refused to participate in 
emergency planning for the seabrook nuclear plant on grounds that it 
would be impossible to evacuate seacoast towns near the plant in an 
emergency 
in light of the refusal the nrc has said it is acceptable for 
the plant operator to file the emergency plans as seabrook pursues a 
lowpower operating license 
tuesdays report said the agency has consolidated its staff and 
commissioners in a single building in rockville md established a 
separate office to handle enforcement of commission rules and 
improved its oversight of reactor activities

farmers who want to get away from pesticides 
are being urged to call a new hotline for advice on organic 
approaches to pest control 
the announcement tuesday of the tollfree number follows release 
the day before of a louis harris survey showing an overwhelming 
majority of americans would buy organically grown produce if it cost 
the same as other fruits and vegetables 
whats critical for consumers and regulators to remember is 
that farmers arent the problem theyre the solution said george 
devault editor of the new farm magazine which is promoting the 
hotline were trying to help farmers who want to reduce their use 
of chemicals get in touch with farmers who already are doing so very 
successfully 
both the survey and the hotline were sponsored by the rodale 
institute organization of emmaus pa which publishes the new farm 
and organic gardening and has been advocating nonchemical 
approaches to farming since 1942 
the hotline is 18004228810 and will be operating through april 
3 
recent publicity about the dangers of chemicals in farming has 
heightened public awareness of the alternatives the harris poll 
said 842 percent of the public would buy organic if its cost were 
the same as other food 
but a pesticide industry spokesman assured that chemicals are 
being used safely 
the bottom line is that we cant grow as much food and the 
quality food this nation enjoys without these products said jay 
vroom of the national agricultural chemical association 
he said the industry has been working to reduce pesticide residue 
on food and other environmental problems that chemicals can cause 
the assault on the system shows no regard for the 40 years 
worth of science behind development of pesticides he said 
three farmers who have turned away from chemicals gave an 
opposite view at the press conference announcing the hotline

heavy military security 
fighting and fear of the rebels kept voter turnout so low that 
results of the presidential election do not accurately reflect the 
peoples will a losing candidate says 
guillermo ungo candidate of the leftist democratic convergence 
said tuesday that those factors and a rebel boycott of the vote 
combined to give the rightist republican nationalist alliance or 
arena victory on sunday 
fighting that has convulsed the nation for nine years flared anew 
late tuesday when leftist rebels attacked the countrys main prison 
in mejicanos just north of san salvador in an apparent attempt to 
free comrades 
three prisoners and one guard were wounded authorities said 
prison commander vitelio ramos said about 300 rebels attacked the 
1800inmate prison with assault rifles and rocketpropelled 
grenades but were unable to penetrate its 12foot cinderblock wall 
they did however manage to cut through a 10foot wire fence around 
the complex 
mariona which rebels have attacked several times a year houses 
several dozen political prisoners 
leftist rebels who have been fighting usbacked government 
since 1980 declared a traffic ban sabotaged the electrical power 
system and boycotted sundays vote which was won by arenas 
candidate coffee baron alfredo cristiani 
there was widespread combat on election day with three 
journalists among the more than 30 people authorities said were 
killed 
arena well financed and organized is the countrys leading 
political force now having won a majority in the legislative 
assembly a year ago and already in control of the judiciary 
but election turnout was the lowest of the decade said election 
officials 
ricardo perdomo chairman of the central elections council said 
about 900000 of el salvadors 183 million voters participated 
with 576339 votes counted in the official tally arena had 538 
percent the outgoing christian democrats 366 percent and the 
centerright national conciliation party 42 ungos democratic 
convergence which had hoped to run a strong third polled just 32 
percent official results were expected thursday 
ungo said the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front had 
seriously erred by trying to disrupt the election and in doing so 
favored arena 
the convergence is a coalition of three leftist parties allied 
with the rebels but the guerrilla antielection campaign strained 
that alliance 
candidate fidel chavez mena of the christian democrats the party 
of president jose napoleon duarte said the most important thing 
was the abstention cristiani will on june 1 take over from 
duarte who is dying of liver cancer and by law could not run for 
reelection 
at a news conference in mexico city the rebels argued that the 
low turnout means arena which has in the past been linked to death 
squad activity lacks a mandate 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said people 
who worry about human rights abuses in el salvador ought to give 
this new government a chance to prove itself before we start 
condemning it in some sort of kneejerk fashion 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed in the civil war 
more than half the victims were civilians and most of those deaths 
are attributed to security forces or rightwing death squads 
arena was founded by roberto daubuisson a former army major 
dismissed from the service for allegedly plotting a coup he has 
been linked to the death squads but denies involvement 
ungo former head of the rebel alliances political bureau 
described many of his coalitions supporters as the rural poor who 
fear the military and remember the death squads of the early 1980s 
there were too many soldiers at the polls and people were 
afraid said ungo who returned from exile to head the first 
leftist ticket in more than a decade 
ana guadalupe martinez a member of the rebel political 
commission said in mexico city the guerrillas accept responsibility 
for the poor showing of the convergence those were our voters who 
stayed away

some officials are worried about a loss 
in tax revenue the only restaurant owner in town wonders if he 
should add more tables and an astrologer in a nearby spiritualist 
community foresees profit 
but all agree that this tiny central florida village will get a 
jolt like a lightning bolt from the heavens if evangelists jim and 
tammy bakker move their television ministry here 
it could be great for business or turn this town inside out 
said chamber of commerce president jerry peters either way if 
the bakkers come this place will not be the same 
im not going to put myself in a position of judging a man by 
his past deeds said mayor john smart a retired air force 
chaplain who last week led bakker on a tour of this area 20 miles 
northeast of orlando what did jesus say he who is without sin 
cast the first stone there are some strong feelings in town no 
doubt but i think we should wait and see 
bakker the former assemblies of god minister who was stripped of 
the ptl television ministry over his tryst with a church secretary 
and questions about finances visited a 28acre television studio 
complex here on friday it was built in 1982 by nautilus exercise 
equipment creator arthur jones and bought in 1986 by dallas investor 
travis ward 
evan keesling one of four people challenging smart in an april 4 
election believes many of the 2500 residents are troubled by the 
secrecy surrounding the negotiations 
i realize that its a private deal but many people would have 
liked bakker to come to them first said keesling who built the 
first nautilus machines with jones in the early 1970s id say the 
mood in town is nervous to jumpy 
peters and others are concerned about the possible loss of 
13900 a year in property taxes because the ministry is taxexempt 
views were mixed in cassadaga less than three miles from town 
where most residents claim psychic powers and an ability to 
communicate with the dead 
i see real estate values going up and money pouring in said 
astrologer hanan leeds it will be good for everyone get the 
idea 
but joe stupar owner of the 62yearold cassadaga hotel wonders 
how the zeal of the bakkers fundamentalist followers will mesh with 
cassadaga mysticism 
im not so sure how bakkers people will relate to this he 
said im hoping for harmony but you never know 
bakker said hed like to relocate the couples jim and tammy 
ministry from pineville nc to lake helen and construct other 
facilities similar to ptls heritage usa theme park in fort mill 
sc he said a decision on a new location likely will be made in two 
months 
but orlando television station wesh reported tuesday night that 
bakker has all but turned down the site because of the 55 million 
asking price the station quoting unnamed sources said bakker 
plans to look at other central florida sites 
bakker and richard dortch his former top deputy were indicted 
in december on charges of diverting more than 4 million in ptl 
money for their own benefit and conspiring to defraud their 
followers bakker said he would purchase a new facility with 
donations and regular bank financing 
tom mead who owns the only restaurant in lake helen said the 
bakkers represent the inevitable change assailing rural florida 
look daytona is 25 minutes away orlando is 20 minutes its 
going to happen why fight it as long as what jim and tammy do is 
legal why not welcome them into the community 
ill add a few tables and have them all over for lunch

the american conservative union has asked the 
justice department to consider whether a special counsel should look 
into the way rep mary rose oakar handles the salaries of her 
personal and house subcommittee staffs 
david keane the organizations chairman made the request 
tuesday in a letter to attorney general richard thornburgh 
the letter asked thornburgh to investigate the allegations in a 
report published tuesday in the washington times and determine if 
the appointment of an independent counsel is warranted 
the newspaper said ms oakar apparently had padded her 
subcommittee staff with personal aides who did little if any 
committee work a contention ms oakar dismissed as an absolute 
lie 
if i wanted to get more personal staff i would recommend to the 
chairman that we increase the personnel staff of our office and i 
have not done that she said 
the congresswoman said she has some shared employees who draw 
partial salaries from both the congressional office and subcommittee 
and who perform work for both

the insecticide aldicarb can cause illness in 
children and infants and should be banned from use on potatoes and 
bananas says a recommendation by scientists at the environmental 
protection agency 
but the epa officials emphasized tuesday the recommendation has 
yet to be considered by a scientific review panel or evaluated for 
final action the full review could take many months 
we have no shred of evidence that this is causing ill 
effects said epa spokesman albert heier 
heier confirmed that the team of scientists reviewing aldicarb 
had recommended to john moore the epas acting deputy 
administrator that aldicarb be barred for use on potatoes and 
bananas because of its potential for causing illness in children and 
infants 
children if exposed to amounts normally on potatoes and bananas 
could get stomach cramps headaches and other ailments the epa 
scientists suggested 
the group recommended continued use of the chemical on a wide 
variety of other food products including citrus because residue 
levels are lower

gov ray mabus has vetoed bills to pay for 
one of the nations two remaining charity hospital systems but 
supporters of the 73yearold system vowed to keep fighting to keep 
it running 
the state senate sustained the veto by adjourning tuesday without 
taking any action on it and mabus said he was willing to take the 
political heat for his action to cut funds to the three 
hospitals and their governing board 
this has been an emotional issue on both sides he said 
people on both sides have made passionate goodfaith arguments 
people of good will have disagreed on what is the right thing to 
do 
the governor has urged lawmakers to take the money for the 
hospitals and use it to expand medicaid a federalstate program 
that helps pay for health care for the needy aged blind and 
disabled and for lowincome families with children 
the bills he vetoed would have provided for operation in the next 
fiscal year of kuhn memorial hospital in vicksburg matty hersee 
hospital in meridian and south mississippi state hospital in laurel 
now theyre slated to close july 1 
the system set up in 1916 maintains 199 of the states 15800 
hospital beds on a budget of 68 million they served 77508 
patients in fiscal 1988 providing free medical care to the needy 
louisiana maintains the nations only other charity hospital 
system 
the mississippi hospitals backers who have held frequent 
rallies at the capitol to protest the closings criticized mabuss 
veto 
the governor is saying that people wont be turned away from 
other hospitals but how will we pay the bill asked marzell 
clayton 54 who said he has used the laurel hospital during the 
past 16 years 
clayton said his lawyer was preparing to file a lawsuit against 
mabus and was trying to get a restraining order to keep the 
hospitals open 
its no problem getting a community hospital to see you but 
you cant pay the bill clayton said adding that he preferred to 
use the free hospital rather than use his medicaid benefits 
i think the governor has made a very serious political 
mistake said eva farrish ford an activist the poor people 
will remember that service was taken away from them 
i hope the legislature will come together and see that these 
hospitals are needed and that the people who use them are good 
people working people said omeria scott another activist 
in vetoing the package of three appropriations bills the 
reformist governor said officials had to decide how can we best 
use our limited money to reach the most people with the best care 
it would have taken a twothirds majority of both houses of the 
legislature to override the veto 
for his part mabus has said he is committed to seeing that the 
money spent on the charity hospitals is used to expand medicaid 
although some lawmakers have said theyd like to pay for additional 
nursing home beds 
i think theres a consensus that we need to expand medicaid 
mabus said that was the only reason that i vetoed this and thats 
been the only reason given to move that money so i certainly hope 
it will go into that 
the governor also said he believed expanding medicaid would help 
save about 45 rural hospitals that are facing closure because of 
financial troubles 
some of them are in financial trouble because they have so much 
uncompensated care some of it will be funded by medicaid he 
said it may keep some of them open 
he conceded however that some of those hospitals might close 
even with an expanded medicaid program

prime minister bob hawkes tearful 
nationally televised admission of infidelity does not seem to have 
hurt his popularity some in fact believe it may have been a 
shrewd political move 
it was vintage hawke weve seen it before hes done it before 
and that is why people like him said pollster gary morgan 
the voters will love him for it said the tabloid daily 
telegraph of sydney 
the paper the only one to editorialize on the interview 
nevertheless was critical of hawke accusing him of subjecting his 
wife hazel to public humiliation 
his frank disclosures about his colorful past do him little 
credit the paper said while it may be refreshing to see such 
openness it reveals a cruel lack of tact 
in the interview broadcast tuesday night hawke admitted to 
cheating on his wife of 33 years 
she understood that it was part of a pretty volatile exuberant 
character hawke wiping back a tear told the channel 7 networks 
newsworld program he did not detail his illicit affairs but said 
his days of philandering were over 
at rival channel 9 27860 people called in for an opinion poll 
which asked are you offended that bob hawke has had an affair 
spokeswoman sue ward said 13237 people replied yes and 14623 said 
they were not offended 
journalist clive robertson who interviewed hawke said he was 
sure the remarks were off the cuff and not a political stunt 
hawkes press secretary barry cassidy was quick to dispute 
speculation that hawkes confession was calculated to win votes 
there are cynics around who will see all sorts of motives but 
once you see it you realize it was totally above board not 
precooked he said it was genuine hawke telling it like it 
was 
but the daily mirror of sydney pleaded please no more pm sob 
stories is this a way to woo the women 
there is a suggestion it said of strength in a confession 
of weakness particularly a shared weakness overcome 
hawke 59 has broken down on television once before when he 
talked about family drug problems in 1984 mrs hawke later went on 
television to explain that their daughter roslyn and soninlaw 
matt had been treated for heroin addiction 
hawkes battles with the bottle are wellknown as a student at 
oxford he was listed in the guinness book of records for his 
beerdrinking prowess hawke says he quit drinking in 1979 
his sexual liaisons also were known to insiders but he had never 
before publicly admitted to them 
hawkes earthy image has made him the countrys most popular 
leader ever he has won an unprecedented three fiveyear terms as 
prime minister and plans to seek a fourth 
he has said he will call new elections by may 1990 but opposition 
liberal party leader john howard is predicting the prime minister 
will be pressured into holding the vote this july 
hawkes popularity is believed to be eroding because of rising 
interest rates higher taxes and other economic woes 
a morgan gallup poll published in the bulletin magazine today 
said support for labor fell two points to 42 percent based on the 
results of a telephone poll of 2463 people earlier this month the 
conservative liberals also lost half a percentage point dropping to 
365 percent 
the poll said hawkes approval rating fell by three points to 48 
percent but that 62 percent of those polled thought hawke a better 
choice for prime minister than howard the poll was taken before the 
hawke interview 
in her biography of hawke blanche dalpuget made reference to 
his drinking and infidelity and said it almost led to the couples 
divorce today she said she found his admission endearing 
its not new but its still nice hes honest enough to come out and 
say it most men wouldnt 
rod cameron a labor party pollster said if the perception is 
that the prime minister is being honest open and frank then it will 
undoubtedly enhance his standing

president corazon aquinos government 
plans to sell 14 million in jewels that imelda marcos left behind 
in 1986 when she and former president ferdinand marcos fled the 
country officials said today 
officials also plan to sell three vacation houses they allege 
were built illegally by the couple with government money 
chairman mateo caparas of the presidential commission on good 
government said the money from the sale of the gems and houses will 
be used to finance the governments land reform program 
caparas told reporters he would ask an antigraft court to allow 
his commission to sell the gems appraised in 1986 at about 14 
million as well as the houses 
its better that we sell the jewelry because firstly the 
comprehensive agrarian reform program needs this and secondly its 
difficult to keep jewels they might even get lost so its better 
that we sell them now caparas said 
officials said at least two boxes of jewelry left behind by mrs 
marcos at the presidential palace during the february 1986 uprising 
that toppled marcos 20year regime are now kept in a central bank 
vault 
commission member rosalio de leon said the agency plans to sell 
at least three vacation homes belonging to the marcoses which they 
allegedly built with public funds 
we will try to determine which houses are already 
deteriorating the ones which are expensive to maintain and are not 
incomeproducing will be sold through public bidding de leon said 
in a telephone interview

a winter storm that killed millions of 
chickens in three states has helped to push nationwide egg prices to 
fiveyear highs just before the easter rush 
and industry experts said the most lasting damage from the early 
march ice and snow storms stem from the deaths of brood hens which 
are poultry producers lifeblood 
ken klippen vice president of united egg producers in atlanta 
estimated losses in missouri oklahoma and arkansas at between 15 
and 2 million brood hens worth about 55 million the losses 
represented just under 1 percent of the nations egglaying 
chickens he said 
for every 1 percent change in supply a corresponding 5 percent 
change in price usually occurs klippen said 
wholesale prices in new york considered an industry benchmark 
rose to 98 cents a dozen for grade a large white eggs from 90 to 92 
cents before the storm hit said jack ross an economist for the 
us department of agriculture in washington prices in midfebruary 
averaged about 66 cents a dozen he said 
the three states have about 75 percent of the nations 230 
million brood hens klippen said arkansas with 9 million of them 
suffered the greatest losses in the storm 
the damage came at a time when egg prices already were rising 
because of traditionally heavy holiday demand he said 
ross said there is a good balance between production and demand 
rather than a shortage of eggs prices will drop again after easter 
he said 
the last time egg prices reached current levels was in 1984 when 
an influenza outbreak decimated pennsylvania flocks and pushed 
wholesale prices above the dollar a dozen mark ross said 
each dead brooder hen represents about 150 chicks that wont be 
produced said lyndon irwin a professor of poultry science at 
southwest missouri state university you have to consider all the 
potential eggs she could have produced in her lifetime 
in all the storm destroyed about 600 poultry houses in missouri 
arkansas and oklahoma about 27 million chickens died in missouri 
and 39 million in oklahoma total damage in the three states has 
been estimated at about 100 million 
missouri officials say the storm was the worst disaster ever to 
hit the states poultry industry and mcdonald county which bills 
itself as the poultry capital of missouri was hardest hit 
our countys economy is based on the poultry industry said 
gene hall the mcdonald county clerk its the largest employer 
off the farm as well as on the farm its probably going to take a 
year or longer to recover lost production will occur in the poultry 
processing plants down the line because of the loss of breeding hens 
and hatcheries 
the good news for the regions poultry producers is that while 
the effects of the storm might last the recent discovery of 
heptachlortainted chicken feed that led to the destruction of 
400000 chickens in arkansas should result in only shortterm 
problems 
in 1987 we produced 879 million chickens here in arkansas so 
this 400000 thats kind of a drop in the bucket said lowell 
lankford a university of arkansas extension poultryman 
he said it takes six to seven weeks to grow a chicken for market 
so farmers should recover quickly from the effects of the banned 
cancercausing pesticide 
still problems will endure from the storms 
most of the farmers plan to rebuild hall said for a lot 
of people this was their sole job those who had a high mortgage 
and no insurance are scared about what lies ahead 
missouri gov john ashcroft has asked that four counties be 
declared federal agricultural disaster areas making additional 
lowinterest loans available to eligible producers 
but some poultry growers say government loans may be insufficient 
contract growers dixie and gary thomas lost five of their eight 
broiler houses worth 65000 each and 80000 chickens insurance 
will cover most of their losses but not enough for the couple to 
rebuild completely 
my concern with lowinterest loans is that all were doing is 
borrowing money to pay for buildings that are already heavily

dick clark the ageless rock n roll emcee 
whose american bandstand gave teenagers everything from the 
jitterbug to madonna says he is leaving the show after 33 years as 
host 
american bandstand syndicated nationwide will move to usa 
network on april 8 with david hirsch as host 
this is actually an exciting day for me clark said tuesday 
like david i was 26 when i started hosting bandstand after 33 
years i finally decided it was time to give someone else a chance 
hirsch a detroit native was discovered at dick clark 
productions in burbank at the time he was a producer for usas 
camp midnite a latenight talk show on usa network which is seen 
in more than 46 million homes through 10000 cable affiliates 
hirsch had to audition for american bandstand 
clarks age 59 had nothing to do with the decision said an 
associate who spoke on condition of anonymity in the past clark 
has indicated he wanted to relinquish his host role by 1990 
bandstand as it was first titled hit the tv air waves in 
september 1952 on wfiltv in philadelphia with bob horn and lee 
stewart as hosts 
but it was clark who took over in 1956 that became the shows 
symbol even as it made him a multimillionaire 
on aug 5 1957 american bandstand debuted on the abc 
network quickly becoming a national success 
generations of teenagers saw the cleancut carefully suited and 
coiffed clark preside over a studio full of equally cleancut teens 
dancing and posing for the cameras 
clark who never danced on the show became the butt of some 
jokes for maintaining his boyish looks over the years he once 
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols 
theyre constantly told how wonderful they look but it gets to 
be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go 
he said it would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully 
offscreen clark has acknowledged that he has a temper and is 
intolerant of mistakes by subordinates but in his bandstand 
persona teens saw him as a friendly hip father figure 
the show was a must for many performers 
during its three decades it has provided the first national 
exposure to scores of performers including madonna the beach boys 
linda ronstadt jerry lee lewis james brown stevie wonder and neil 
diamond 
others making nationwide debuts on the show included chubby 
checker buddy holly sonny amp cher the doors barry manilow 
prince pat benatar sheena easton cyndi lauper and billy idol 
american bandstand also launched songs onto the bestseller 
charts and introduced america to such dances as the twist jerk 
bunny hop hustle and break dancing 
in 1987 american bandstand was entered into the guinness 
book of world records as televisions longestrunning variety 
program it has earned five emmy awards 
the show has been on the air 37 years through more than 6000 
hours played more than 65000 records and been host to more than 
600000 dancing teenagers 
in a 1986 interview with usa today clark said he helped in 
keeping the music alive in the early days of televised rock but 
described himself as a fortunate man of limited abilities 
i dont have any basic talents myself he said i have the 
ability to work on television and feel comfortable with and make 
other people feel confortable with it thats probably some sort of 
a mild form of talent beyond that i dont get too serious about 
it

the mystery of how cocaine triggers heart 
attacks may have been partly solved by scientists who found the drug 
can induce spasms in dog and rabbit arteries 
up until recently theres been a missing link about how 
cocaine caused the heart attacks especially in people whose 
arteries arent clogged with fatty plaque said dr jeffrey isner a 
cardiovascular medicine professor at bostons tufts university 
theres now overwhelming evidence cocaine may cause spasm of 
vascular smooth muscle the principal component of the normal 
artery he said adding that how the drug starts spasms isnt 
known 
studies presented tuesday during the american college of 
cardiologys annual meeting indicated how cocaine can kill by 
narrowing arteries and how it also impairs the hearts electrical 
system 
smoked crack cocaine is more dangerous because it is absorbed 
into blood more quickly but inhaled powder cocaine is clearly 
enough to achieve blood levels that can cause these cardiac 
complications isner said 
dr robert kloner heart research director at hospital of the 
good samaritan in los angeles said his study found that high 
dosages of cocaine given rapidly cause narrowing of coronary 
arteries and depression of the function of the heart 
recreational doses also have been shown to have effects he 
said you dont need to be on a binge to have a heart attack 
a heart attack is the death of part of the heart muscle it 
occurs when arteries that are narrowed or blocked keep a section of 
the heart from getting enough oxygen which is carried in blood 
researchers believe cocaine triggers a spasm narrowing an artery 
and allowing a clot to form at the narrowing to cause the heart 
attack 
kloner and biochemist sharon hale gave binge doses of cocaine 
to anesthetized dogs the drug not only constricted arteries to 
reduce blood flow to the heart but made the hearts main pumping 
chamber less efficient 
drs gary schaer and frederick kuhn of washingtons georgetown 
university medical center injected dogs with recreational doses of 
cocaine 
they found it temporarily narrowed the diameter of the coronary 
artery by 20 percent and increased resistance to blood flow in small 
vessels by 55 percent just as the drug made the heart beat more 
rapidly so it needed more oxygenrich blood 
these data suggest that an imbalance between heart muscle 
oxygen supply and demand may play a role on the cardiovascular 
complications associated with cocaine abuse the study concluded 
isner studied ringshaped slices of aorta the main artery from 
the heart taken from rabbits he bathed them in nutrients added 
the equivalent of a recreational dose of cocaine then observed 
those rings were contracting in response to cocaine 
dr cynthia tracy of georgetown university medical center in 
washington said her study of cocaine in dogs showed recreational 
doses can cause direct electrical effects on the cardiac 
electrical system setting up conditions that allow an irregular 
heartbeat to develop 
an estimated 25 million americans have used cocaine at least 
once including 6 million regular users and 1 million addicts isner 
said 
only 78 cases of cocaineinduced heart trouble have been reported 
in medical journals but the true figure is vastly higher because 
the journals report only firsttime or unusual cases he said 
two of the most publicized cases were the 1986 deaths of 
university of maryland basketball star len bias and cleveland browns 
football player don rogers

minister noboru takeshitas administration has suffered due to three 
cabinetlevel resignations and arrests of former government 
officials on suspicion of taking bribes

tokyo she said the rumor was believed to have originated in the 
japanese equities market 
ms takeuchi said that although the dollar was unlikely to exceed 
the 132yen level soon the majority of japanese investors are 
inclined to buy the dollar

director james lapine has taken william 
shakespeare at his word 
the play is called the winters tale and thats what lapine 
has put on stage at the new york shakespeare festivals public 
theater a celebration of storytelling 
the production which opened tuesday is a fantastical tale of 
love jealousy loss and finally rebirth its the eighth in joseph 
papps marathon presentation of all of shakespeares plays and it 
ranks among the most distinctive and fully realized productions in 
the series 
lapine accentuates the storybook qualities of the play it opens 
with an elaborate mime sequence as the actors walk on stage take 
their costumes from a trunk and then disappear as a little boy 
begins reading the play 
the winters tale is rarely produced and you can see why very 
easily its two different plays in one the first act is a somber 
almost unrelieved tragedy in which leontes king of sicilia 
banishes his wife hermione after suspecting her of having an 
affair with polixenes king of bohemia a son dies and an infant 
daughter is abandoned 
act 2 which takes place 16 years later blossoms with unexpected 
love and a happy reunion of all the major characters time 
eventually heals all that was so quickly damaged and almost 
destroyed 
in a way the play resembles a fairy tale a genre with which 
lapine has some familiarity hes the author and director of into 
the woods the fairy tale musical now playing on broadway but the 
characters in the winters tale are much more human despite 
some of their extraordinary adventures lapine emphasizes their 
relationships particularly the love triangle between the two kings 
and the queen 
he sets up the triangle very clearly and gets strong distinctive 
characterizations from his three major actors mandy patinkin makes 
leontes jealousy believable it builds gradually exploding with 
full force at both diane venora a heartbroken hermione and 
christopher reeve who is all manly bewilderment as polixenes 
their tragedy is downplayed in the second act when perdita 
leontes longlost daughter and florizel polixenes son meet and 
fall in love the setting is rustic bohemia and designer franne lee 
pulls a panoramic painting of green trees across the multilevel 
setting to suggest this rural and much happier life 
the supporting cast is uneven rocco sisto is a standout as the 
roguish pickpocket autolycus but graham winton and jennifer dundas 
are bland as the young lovers and alfre woodard pushes too hard with 
little effect as the loyal servant paulina 
fortunately lapine has his three stars to carry much of the 
evening its their sorrow and eventual reconciliation that he puts 
on stage most poignantly and makes the winters tale well worth 
watching 
in other reviews the new york times frank rich wrote 
lapine is even more impressive in his ability to knit 
shakespeares many moods into elegant unity there are echoes of 
the stephen sondheimlapine musicals in this winters tale 
but it is the directors keen eye for every detail a rarity in the 
new york shakespeare festival marathon that really tells the tale 
a production of this play should be as resplendent as a finely 
woven tapestry howard kissel wrote in the daily news though it 
has its bright moments this production more nearly resembles a 
crazy quilt lacking unity or depth this complex play requires very 
firm direction which is not lapines forte 
clive barnes in the new york post called it a wellacted and 
moderately simple production of the play making intelligent if 
still nervous use of the shakespearean upper stage and very 
sensibly concentrating on the plays stylized sense of decorum and 
its touches of very real magic

a 44yearold man was executed by 
injection early today for murdering a man nearly 11 years ago by 
smashing his head repeatedly with a shotgun butt during a robbery 
that netted 1150 
leon king showed little emotion as he received lethal injection 
for the death of 26yearold michael clayton underwood whose 
girlfriend was repeatedly raped and sodomized during the april 1978 
attack according to court records 
i appreciate what you did for me king told five friends 
witnessing the execution i love you all god bless 
he closed his eyes and sighed as the drugs began to take hold 
he was declared dead at 1227 am 10 minutes after the 
injection began 
its about time said doug shaver who prosecuted kings case 
and is now a judge in houston 
if anyone deserves the death penalty its him said shaver 
adding that king had never expressed remorse for the killing 
king became the third person executed this year in the united 
states and the 107th since the us supreme courts 1976 ruling that 
allowed states to resume capital punishment he was the 30th inmate 
to be put to death in texas which has executed more people than any 
other state since the mid1970s 
on tuesday king lost lastminute appeals before a federal 
district judge a federal appeals court in new orleans and the us 
supreme court his attorneys contended that king suffered from 
organic brain damage 
king was convicted and sentenced to death twice in underwoods

girlfriend were abducted at gunpoint from a houston nightclub on 
april 10 1978 and taken to a remote area where underwood was

syrian troops and their lebanese militia 
allies tightened a 2dayold siege of the christian heartland today 
as rival forces traded sporadic mortar and rocket fire in and around 
beirut 
police said at least two people were wounded when a 120mm mortar 
round fired from christian east beirut crashed in the murr 
neighborhood of west beirut 
a police spokesman said druse militiamen fired three 
sovietdesigned katyusha rockets from moslem west beirut into the 
coastal strip of the christian enclave early in the day but no 
casualties were reported 
all five crossings linking the two sectors of the capital were 
closed for a second day by militiamen in west beirut 
syrian troops in central and northern lebanon blocked christian 
outlets in these areas leaving about 1 million christians besieged 
in a 310squaremile crescentshaped enclave with the mediterranean 
at their backs 
the siege comes after two weeks of fighting between christian 
army units under gen michel aoun and syrianbacked militiamen of 
druse warlord walid jumblatts progessive socialist party 
police say 66 people have been killed and 213 wounded in the two 
weeks of renewed civil war fighting 
moslem and christian militia allies of aoun and jumblatt have 
avoided direct involvement in the sectarian fighting the worst in 
four years 
but syrian troops and lebanese moslem units under maj gen sami 
khatib manned checkpoints on gateways to the christian regions 
preventing motorists and pedestrians from crossing in either 
direction 
khatibs soldiers blocked a midcity crossing today with barbed 
wire and roughed up reporters and photographers reporting from 
there 
ill shoot bullets into your eyes if you shoot pictures one 
private shouted at photographers after cocking his usmade m16 
assault rifle 
therese najjar a maronite catholic woman pleaded with moslem 
soldiers to allow her and her 10yearold son tony to cross to 
east beirut 
ive been trapped in west beirut since yesterday i have no 
place to stay please let me cross a tearful mrs najjar said 
i brought my son for a medical checkup my three other children 
have been alone at home in east beirut since yesterday i am a 
widow she said 
but one soldier retorted go away go away try to find a place 
to stay in west beirut the crossing will be closed for awhile 
the leftist daily newspaper assafir which is close to syria 
said the crossings were closed in response to aouns siege of the 
ports 
assafir quoted unnamed moslem officials as saying aouns forces 
have been training for naval and ground landings in west beirut to 
seize the central bank it gave no other details 
the present confrontation broke out when aoun a maronite 
ordered a blockade of militiarun ports in an effort to reactivate 
tax collection at the five government harbors along lebanons 
130mile mediterranean coast 
syrianbacked factions rejected the move and aoun responded by 
declaring a war of liberation against syrian forces in lebanon 
syria has 40000 troops in east and north lebanon as well as west 
and south beirut aoun and other christian leaders accuse the 
syrians of failing in the peacekeeping role they were given in 1976 
by the 22nation arab league

the pungent smell of burning sweet grass and the 
rhythms of traditional chants greeted a 38yearold cree indian as 
he completed a 2700mile run from canada to lay claim to a sacred 
relic stored in a museum 
driven by a vision jim thunder set off from edmonton alberta 
in september to ask anthropologists at the american museum of 
natural history to return the 150yearold artifact a parcel of 
calico holding bear claws a clump of sweet grass and a plug of 
tobacco to his people in western canada 
thunder and a small delegation of indians were to meet today with 
museum officials who will decide whether to give up the parcel 
this is a sacred bundle that was a gift from the spirit world 
to the indian people for the past 50 years it has been waiting 
here thunder said tuesday as he spoke to about 100 indians and 
supporters across from the museum 
in 1934 a son of chief big bear of the crees gave the sacred 
bundle to a museum researcher in western canada for safekeeping 
since that time the museum has kept it as part of a research 
collection but has never put the bundle on public display 
a lot of our culture is being stored away from us were not 
given access to our cultural heritage said lewis cardinal an 
indian activist from alberta 
thunder and other indians say the bundle should be returned to 
indians who would use it in prayers and sacred ceremonies 
if the museum gives it up thunder said he would take it back to 
the cree plains indians in western canada where tribal elders would 
decide who would keep it if it refuses the request thunder said he 
would quietly return to his home in edmonton 
we are confident that we will get the bundle back because since 
the 1930s there have been prophesies that it would return thunder 
told the rally after he and two companions completed their trek 
carrying a curved staff draped with eagle feathers for strength 
and wearing over his back the pelt of a young wolf for protection 
thunder was greeted with indian chants singing and traditional 
dancing a sharp smell of sweet grass burned as incense filled the 
air 
thunder said he was driven by a recurring dream in which big bear 
instructed him to retrieve the object 
big bear the leader of the plains cree made the sacred bundle 
about 150 years ago when he was about 13 years old and wore it into 
battle for strength and guidance 
several other men accompanied thunder during his journey running 
the course in relays but thunder was the only one to make the 
entire trip

the wife of the uss vincennes skipper was fired 
from her teaching job after her narrow escape from a suspected 
terrorist bomb that destroyed her van according to a published 
report today 
sharon rogers was stunned upon learning last week that the board 
of directors at the la jolla country day school had decided to fire 
her but she requested that her departure be described as a mutual 
decision so it wouldnt look as if she had been dismissed the los 
angeles times reported 
school officials denied the report and said mrs rogers decided 
to leave her fourthgrade teaching job to ensure the safety of the 
children 
we will stand by that mutual decision part of the statement 
we released on thursday said jim stewart the schools 
development director it was by mutual consent 
stewart said the school would pay her full salary through august 
but he didnt say how much that was 
the fbi is investigating whether the bombing which occurred 
march 10 as mrs rogers was driving to school by herself was in 
retaliation for her husbands order to shoot down an iranian 
airliner over the persian gulf last summer 
capt will c rogers iii mistakenly thought the plane was an 
attacking military jet when he ordered a missile fired that downed 
the civilian jet killing all 290 people aboard 
mrs rogers got out of the vehicle moments before it exploded and 
escaped injury 
she thought she would return to work after this weeks spring 
break and was unhappy at not being given a chance to tell school 
administrators why she thought she should be allowed to continue 
teaching the times quoted one unidentified source as saying 
rogers now at sea on the vincennes for several days of training 
exercises was distressed because he was told the naval 
investigative service was preparing to safeguard the school while 
his wife was teaching there the times quoted unidentified sources 
as saying 
in their first public statement since the bombing the couple 
spoke out against bowing to terrorism in a letter to local 
newspapers tuesday 
the image of a burning van in the middle of a street of our 
community must not become a symbol of fear and unreasoned 
reaction they said in the letter instead it should represent 
the resolve and courage of a community and nation to resist and 
defeat the mindless and cowardly process of terrorism whatever the 
source

backers of house legislation to raise the 
minimum wage lowered their target to 455 an hour on the eve of 
debate as president bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto 
should congress go above 425 
the democratic sponsors of the bill scheduled for floor debate 
beginning today also agreed tuesday to include a subminimum 
training wage in their measure a 60day proposal that falls far 
short of the sixmonth period demanded by bush 
and the president at a white house meeting with reporters 
insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage 
which has been frozen for eight years 
bush appeared with labor secretary elizabeth dole who was there 
to deliver a letter from 35 republican senators who promised to side 
with bush should he veto minimumwage legislation that fails to meet 
white house guidelines 
the administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage 
now at 335 an hour to 425 an hour by 1992 provided employers 
can pay new hires a training wage of 335 an hour for six 
months the administration says the subminimum wage is needed for 
employers to create and fill entrylevel jobs 
mrs dole appearing today on cbs this morning said many 
more jobs and job opportunities are saved if you have a sixmonth 
training wage 
the minimum wage is not the tool for lifting people out of 
poverty most people on minimum wage are very young they are 
parttime workers theyre living at home and theyre not in 
poverty mrs dole said if we are trying to lift people out of 
poverty lets go to other means such as training and education and 
literacy 
theres enough votes in our grasp here to see that we dont 
bust the budget and increase the pressures on inflation by going 
beyond that which the secretary and i have agreed on bush said 
tuesday weve thought out a level of increase on the minimum wage 
that would help people and yet would not add gasoline to any 
inflation fires that are burning 
the 35 senators if their support for bush held would leave 
democrats short of the twothirds majority needed to override a veto 
for eight years this same coalition of republican senators has 
blocked any increase in the minimum wage said sen edward m 
kennedy dmass sponsor of a senate bill to raise the minimum wage 
to 465 by 1992 every american who works for a living deserves a 
living wage not a subpoverty wage 
senate floor action is still pending on kennedys bill 
the bill due for house debate today calls for raising the minimum 
wage to 465 by 1992 and has no provision for a subminimum 
training wage an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized 
labor which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals 
but the sponsors facing mounting pressure from the white house 
and moderate democrats agreed to scale back the final level to 
455 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out tuesday 
that has the support of the house leadership 
at the same time however they said they would move up the 
effective date of the initial increase to 385 an hour to oct 1 
three months earlier than had been planned the amendment to be 
offered thursday calls for then boosting the minimum wage to 425 
on oct 1 1990 and to 455 a year later 
the 60day training wage would apply only to new entrants in the 
job market exclude agricultural workers and expire on sept 30 
1992 according to aides the training wage would initially be 335 
an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases 
in the minimum wage 
workers hired to fill jobs that had been vacated by recent 
layoffs could not be paid the training wage a provision designed to 
prevent abuse of the system in order to pay lower wages

the army did an aboutface and agreed to 
discharge a soldier who sued to get out of the military so that she 
could mother her 6monthold daughter 
i feel really great im really happy that theyve finally 
figured out that i was right and that justice prevailed spec 4 
cheryl beekman 21 said tuesday at fort eustis 
the armys onesentence declaration said after further review 
officials at fort eustis approved her request for discharge 
her group commander col david a whaley would not comment 
ms beekmans attorney kenneth e labowitz said it was unlikely 
the decision would set a precedent because his clients request met 
requirements laid out in army regulations for hardship discharges 
i suppose its like the discovery of gravity its not all that 
big a deal he said its been there all along 
ms beekman joined the army 2 years ago and gave birth to lauren 
ashley in september soldiers have the option of resigning during 
pregnancy but ms beekman declined hoping to balance motherhood 
and her military duties 
but in october her husband chris took a job in tacoma wash 
and the next month ms beekman was ordered to report to south korea 
without her daughter 
ms beekman asked for a hardship discharge which was ruled 
legally sufficient by an army staff judge advocate but whaley 
rejected the request 
last week ms beekman sued in federal court seeking the 
reversal of the army ruling the army halted her departure for korea 
until the suit could be settled

a tanker truck carrying explosives 
and detonators to a fireworks factory caught fire and exploded 
today killing a fireman and sending 67 people to the hospital 
officials said 
workers at nearby factories said they dived for cover as the 
powerful explosion ripped roofs from buildings smashed windows and 
tore down power lines in an industrial park in peterborough 75 
miles north of london 
the cambridgeshire fire and rescue service said it received a 
telephone call at 930 am reporting a tanker on fire outside 
vibroplant plc an industrial rental company at the fengate 
industrial park 
soon after firefighters arrived and before the park could be 
evacuated the truck blew up witnesses said it was torn to 
shreds and the wreckage strewn over at least 300 yards 
the fire brigade said it was first told the truck was carrying 
oil then that it was carrying industrial chemicals police later 
said it was loaded with explosives and detonators destined for the 
nearby le maitre fireworks factory 
five buildings were seriously damaged including vibroplant said 
a spokesman for the cambridgeshire constabulary speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british custom 
many of the injured were burned or cut by flying glass he said 
the fire department confirmed that one of its firefighters was 
killed and that five firefighters were among the injured 
police warned the public not to touch the copper cyanide 
detonators saying they could explode 
lionel down general manager of the fireworks factory a halfmile 
away said the explosion was like i would imagine a nuclear bomb 
would sound 
there was a huge cloud of smoke and half the ceiling dropped on 
my head in my office he said 
david hillson who works nearby said the scene was one of 
absolute devastation 
two fire tenders fire engines have been damaged in the blast 
which seems to have happened as the fire brigade were damping down 
the tanker before it exploded hillson said 
there are many new buildings nearby which havent got a pane of 
glass left in them roofs have been blown off buildings and some 
older buildings are not far off being totally demolished he said 
david wells owner of fengate salvage co 300 yards from 
vibroplant said there were a few minor explosions like someone 
shooting off a powerful gun suddenly there was an almighty 
explosion 
bits came flying over towards my premises the roof blew off 
part of the building a window was blown in and myself and a 
customer just dived for cover wells said 
ambulances are running casualties to and fro between the scene

the tiny indian girl was beyond help 
just three months old she was blind severely dehydrated and 
stricken with pneumonia the babys illness her mother said began 
with a compliment 
its a superstition here that if somebody tells you your baby 
is pretty something bad will happen to it said pamela lear a 
nurse practitioner from greenville ky and a 1st lieutenant in the 
kentucky national guard 
the baby also was coated with dried herbs when her mother brought 
her to the mountaintop clinic a zahorin or traditional healer 
had tried in the ancient mayan way to ward off the spirits believed 
to be afflicting the child 
to lear and lt col paula maionchi a richmond ky physician 
it was obvious that something bad had surely happened it was 
equally obvious that it had nothing to do with compliments and 
curses 
it had to do with severe vitamin a deficiency debilitating 
diarrhea intestinal parasites and the tragic decision of a young 
mother in an isolated society to turn first to a medicine man for 
help maionchi arranged the babys transfer to a hospital two hours 
away in guatemala city she died en route 
it was the gravest illness that the 475th mobile army surgical 
hospital and 973rd dental detachment would face this day in the 
sierra madre where the guards spent part of a twoweek training and 
humanitarianaid mission 
in a larger sense the childs illness was a severe example of 
problems that are widespread in a mayan population where infant 
mortality is high life expectancy is low and the time in between is 
arduous half of guatemalas 77 million residents are descendants 
of the mayans 
lear and capt douglas stevens a lexington ky physician were 
seeing ailments they didnt encounter at home including 
tuberculosis in young people parasitic diseases were rampant 
malnutrition and bronchitis were common 
up to 80 percent of mayan children die before their first 
birthdays said col michael mcconnell chief surgeon of the us 
armys southern command the guards were seeing the ones that made 
it through said mcconnell who observed the training and 
treatment here and at choatulum and chemachoy 
at each site the guards set up shop in a tiny clinic of a 
standard government design three small examining rooms off a 
compact waiting area the clinics were equipped with cold water and 
almost nothing else 
the clinic in xepatan was without heat or light capt david 
obanion a louisville dentist and sgt charisse newton a 
frankfort dental technician extracted teeth by the light of 
batterypowered head lamps 
at choatalum the line of patients was long but dr joseph dobner 
wasnt seeing unusual cases the tiny bulletriddled building in 
which he set up his clinic however was a far cry from his 
frankfort office part of the roof had been blown away and the 
windows shattered electricity came from a generator so loud that 
i cant listen to the lungs so we tend not to use it 
im hightech in a very lowtech situation said dobner a 
lieutenant colonel in the 475th mash and an orthopedic surgeon 
when you put any organization through a rigorous situation 
theyre going to learn and its going to forge them into a more 
cohesive unit and they learn how to work with adversity and boy 
were working with adversity 
the mayans also have suffered from guatemalas 30yearold civil 
war government critics say the military engaged in a scorched 
earth campaign to rid the countryside of rebels and their 
potential supporters among indians 
national guard units from iowa and georgia preceded kentuckys 
under an agreement with the guatemalan government each exercise was 
conducted with the army medical corps ministry of health and the 
animal health agency 
like his colleagues dobner spent his time treating parasitic 
infections lung ailments and dispensing ointments and pain 
relievers for countless aching joints and muscles that are the 
legacy of life in the rugged sierra madre 
im amazed at these people you dont see much in the way of 
major orthopedic problems because theyre dead they dont have a 
chance if theyre at all infirm theyre gone dobner said 
there is no training opportunity that even comes close to 
this at home said maj allen youngman assistant chief of staff 
this is an opportunity to do something right that maybe we havent 
done right in the past 
for maj beverly vance an eastern kentucky university nursing 
instructor it was the most gratifying experience ive ever had 
it will make my unit better support of the operation is not 
what it should be but it never is dobner said because 
pharmaceutical needs change with the seasons the mission also 
taught the southern command a few things 
the unit was learning to do without medical supplies that were 
either in short supply or were used up rapidly he said everyone 
seeking treatment at choatalum had head lice for example and 
antilice medicine was quickly gone 
three days into the exercise and we were out of something that 
would make life lots better but the last group down here from the 
georgia guard didnt use what they had because it was a different 
season he said 
the stoicism of the mayans was underscored at xepatan where 
obanion and newton averaged about two extractions per patient the 
only practical treatment under the circumstances for scores with 
rotted teeth 
one of the patients a slightly built 27yearold man had a 
badly abscessed tooth he probably was seeing for the first time a 
long needle like the one used to shoot anesthesia into his gums but 
he didnt flinch 
they live with chronic pain the needle is no big deal 
obanion said 
but the acidity of the mans infected gum tissue negated the 
anesthetic and he soon was in obvious pain he clenched the sides of 
the examining table as obanion worked to extract a tooth that was 
shattering with each touch 
its like trying to take a piece of glass out of concrete he 
said you just have to be patient and work at it hell feel 
noticeable improvement after a couple of hours 
his ordeal over the patient eased himself off the table plunked 
a battered hat on his head and moved toward the door there he 
paused and gave a broad wave to obanion and newton 
obanion nodded in return 
another satisfied customer he said

andrei d sakharovs bid for a seat in the new 
soviet legislature may be revived now that the soviet academy of 
sciences has rejected most of the candidates on the officially 
backed slate 
the outcome means the academy will have to vote again giving 
sakharov another chance for election to the 2250seat congress of 
peoples deputies academy members had left the human rights 
activist off the official slate 
but members of the prestigious academy on tuesday approved just 
eight of the 23 candidates nominated for the 20 legislative seats 
alloted to the academy the official tass news agency reported 
sakharov a physicist and other reformminded academicians had 
called for rejection of the oldguard candidates 
sakharov meeting with other academy members today said the 
outcome of tuesdays vote is a victory for those seeking greater 
democracy sakharov a nobel peace prize laureate spent almost 
seven years in internal exile for criticizing the kremlins military 
drive into afghanistan 
the rejection of most of the official slate means a new vote will 
have to be held to fill the final 12 seats tass said it did not 
say what process would be followed but said a new election would be 
held after two weeks 
in the new soviet election system people become candidates when 
they are nominated by others not by simply announcing their 
intentions 
there are many people who want to nominate sakharov who said 
tuesday that he would feel obligated to serve if elected 
several academy members gathering at moscow state university 
today called for sakharovs nomination to the legislature but 
academy president gury marchuk said the gathering did not have 
authority to select candidates 
he said whatever group is formed by the academy to put a new 
slate of candidates before the membership must also be approved by 
the national electoral commission 
tass said 1279 academy members and delegates from top soviet 
research institutes voted by secret ballot for three hours in 
moscows palace of youth on tuesday it gave no breakdown of the 
vote 
efforts to get sakharov on the initial academy slate were 
rejected by the academy leadership on jan 18 although he had been 
nominated by 55 scientific institutions for a seat in the new 
legislature 
prosakharov forces subsequently focused on persuading academy 
members to reject at least some of the candidates on the officially 
backed slate 
tass noted the controversy in reporting the results there was 
a clash of opinions as to whether the procedure of candidates 
nomination was democratic 
it quoted vladimir kudryavtsev academy vice president as saying 
the elections showed the growth of democratization in the academy 
and made for more profound understanding between the leadership of 
the academy and broad scientific public 
the races for the congress of peoples deputies have been marked 
by a rare diversity of views and unprecedented public debate 
boris yeltsin the ousted moscow party boss turned populist 
reformer on tuesday said soviets should be able to freely elect 
candidates for all leadership posts including the presidency held 
by mikhail s gorbachev 
we need direct elections from top to bottom including for the 
presidency said yeltsin who is seeking a seat representing 
moscow in the new legislature the seat will be filled in nationwide 
elections sunday 
the communist party is guaranteed 100 seats in the legislature 
and yeltsin criticized it for avoiding contested races by nominating 
just 100 candidates he said the move is not the best example of 
democracy for our society 
yeltsin who was ousted as city party chief in 1987 for 
criticizing the slow pace of reforms campaigned tuesday in the 
heart of opponent yevgeny brakovs territory he spoke and answered 
questions for three hours in a conference hall at the giant zil 
factory brakov runs 
yeltsins candidacy has been thrust into the limelight by what he 
says is a campaign organized against him by the moscow party elite 
the congress of peoples deputies which will meet only one day a 
year is to elect the countrys acting fulltime legislature from 
among its membership and choose the soviet president a post now 
held by gorbachev 
a total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to public 
organizations like the academy of sciences and the communist party 
the other 1500 are for representatives of the 15 constituent 
soviet republics and their electoral districts those seats will be 
filled in sundays elections

parliament today opened discussions on 
constitutional changes to create a freely elected senate and to 
enact other reforms developed at talks between the communist 
government and the opposition 
the model of economy and way of wielding power adopted in the 
40s ceased to fulfil its function jan kaczmarek a communist 
party deputy told the parliament or sejm our goal is to build a 
good basis for social democracy 
the parliament will also consider the creation of laws on 
elections independent political organizations and unions 
during the debate the communistallied democratic party demanded 
a separate law to regulate political parties the constitution does 
not mention the possibility of political parties forming other than 
those named as part of a communistcontrolled coalition 
several political clubs have sprung up and they say they would 
like to act as independent political parties 
following the first formal readings of the new legislation today 
the bills are to be handed over to committees that will consider 
them for several weeks and add amendments suggested by the 
government as a result of the talks 
because the sejm is controlled by the communist party any 
legislation agreed upon by the party leadership is assured of 
passage 
the constitutional changes are part of an unprecedented 
compromise government and opposition leaders are negotiating at the 
talks that began feb 6 and are scheduled to end april 3 with the 
signing of a new social contract to set polands future course 
in exchange for restoring solidaritys status as the first 
independent trade union in the east bloc the communist government 
hopes for a period of political stability that will improve chances 
for economic recovery controls have already been loosened on 
private entrepreneurs and make western lenders sympathetic to 
polands staggering foreign debt and current investment needs 
under the planned accord solidarity and other nowbanned 
opposition groups would agree to take part in elections to the 
parliament in which the governing coalition is still guaranteed to 
win at least 65 percent of the 460 seats 
but a new senate would be created to which elections would be 
democratic for the first time in the communist bloc anyone would 
be free to run and directly compete against communist candidates 
in turn an office of the president with strong powers would be 
created the president would be elected by the sejm and the senate 
and the communist party could be expected to obtain the office due 
to its sejm majority 
in january the communist party leadership decided in principle 
to legalize solidarity banned since the imposition of martial law 
in december 1981 
solidarity led by lech walesa then agreed to participate in the 
talks with the government first proposed by authorities during a 
severe wave of labor unrest in august

the four detainees who escaped 
in pajamas from their guards at a hospital walked out of their 
refuge at the west german embassy today after the government 
guaranteed their freedom 
we emerge feeling victorious said ephraim nkoe 28 one of 
the four black activists who fled to the embassy monday from 
johannesburgs hillbrow hospital where they were admitted after 
joining a widespread hunger strike 
nkoe said the four just marched out of the hospital in 
pajamas when their guards were not looking walked along a busy 
downtown street and took a minibus taxi to the embassy in pretoria 
the men pressed the buzzer at the embassys locked gate nkoe said 
and were allowed in after saying they had an urgent message for one 
of the diplomats 
the men accompanied by two lawyers emerged from the embassy at 
midmorning today then returned to johannesburg for a news 
conference 
they said the government guaranteed their unconditional freedom 
but they called for release of the estimated 300 activists still 
detained without charge 
the escapees specifically urged the release of sandile thusi a 
detainee hospitalized in critical condition in durban who has not 
eaten for 33 days nkoe said law and order minister adriaan vlok 
sent a police general to durban today to determine if thusi should 
be released 
the four escapees had been held for periods of 10 months to 23 
months in addition to nkoe they are job sithole 21 mpho lekgoro 
24 and clive radebe 28 all leaders of youth organizations 
affiliated to the banned united democratic front antiapartheid 
coalition 
many detainees freed since the hunger strike began in january 
have been placed under tough restrictions limiting their movements 
and involvement in antiapartheid groups the law and order ministry 
imposed no restrictions on the four escapees and said release orders 
were being prepared for three of them at the time of their getaway 
the detainees in a statement said this claim was difficult to 
believe their skepticism was shared by business day a 
johannesburg newspaper which said vlok was trying to conceal both 
the shame of detention without trial and the embarrassment of 
release without notice 
more than 600 detainees have joined in hunger strikes for varying 
periods since january demanding to be released or put on trial 
foreign minister pik botha last week said the government has 
authorized the release of 580 detainees since midfebruary but 
human rights groups say about 300 people remain in detention 
including several hunger strikers in critical condition 
the arbitrary manner in which the minister vlok decides on 
the fate of detainees gives us the impression that he does not 
regard us as human beings but as numbers the escapees said 
there is no basis for keeping some and releasing others 
the statecontrolled south african broadcasting corp in a 
commentary today said the escape would have a damaging impact on 
south africas image abroad 
the cause of negotiation and reconciliation inside south africa 
will be set back and this will serve to emphasize the continuing 
need for the state of emergency the sabc said 
the governments handling of the escape was similar to its 
response last year when three prominent united democrat front 
leaders in detention escaped from a hospital and took refuge at the 
us consulate in johannesburg 
seeking to minimize international publicity about the incident 
the government promptly announced that the three were free to leave 
without restriction after more than five weeks the men did leave 
the consulate and have resumed leading roles in the antiapartheid 
movement

a west virginia house panel decided 
against a reprimand and moved ahead with impeachment proceedings 
against the state treasurer accused of mismanaging an investment 
fund that lost 279 million 
the judiciary committee on tuesday voted 1510 against 
reprimanding a james manchin 
our vote to impeach is the same as an indictment said 
delegate james pitrolo a democrat who suggested the censure it 
blackens a mans name 
but republican delegate marc harman said censure instead of 
impeachment would send a message to officeholders that you can do 
anything you damn well please and all were going to do is censure 
you 
we are tired of being laughed at and being made fun of because 
we are too dumb to solve our own problems harman said 
the committee was scheduled this afternoon to resume a 
linebyline review of an impeachment resolution accusing the 
flamboyand democrat of neglect of duty maladministration 
incompetence and high crimes and misdemeanors 
fifteen of the 25 committee members have already said they will 
vote for impeachment 
among the allegations are that manchin gave complete control over 
the investment division to unqualified employees did nothing to 
ensure they did their jobs properly failed to follow up on warnings 
of problems in the investments and allowed his staff to violate 
numerous state laws and regulations 
manchin a public servant for 41 years blamed his subordinates 
for any illegal activity he said he did not learn of 279 million 
in losses and interest overpayments the bulk of which occurred from 
april to june 1987 until december 1988 
if the committee recommends impeachment the case against manchin 
will be sent to the house of delegates 
if 51 of the 100 members there vote for impeachment the 
treasurer will be tried in the senate where a twothirds majority 
of the 34 members is needed to remove him 
even manchins supporters conceded that he deserves some type of 
punishment 
delegate pat bradley a democrat called him dumb lazy and 
barnum and bailey all the way through but said the fact that 
the man is halfloony is not an impeachable offense

the sale of ptls assets is jeopardized by 
an 8yearold lawsuit claiming that a vast area of south carolina is 
the historic preserve of the catawba indians 
the dispute over 225 square miles including the cities of rock 
hill and fort mill and highly developed areas outside charlotte 
nc has made it difficult for property buyers to obtain title 
insurance to protect their ownership rights 
among those affected by the catawbas claim is canadian 
businessman stephen mernick whom a us bankruptcy court judge 
selected in december to buy the land in fort mill where jim bakker 
built his religious television empire 
mernick assumed joint management of the property with a 
bankruptcy trustee on feb 13 but no date has been set to close the 
sale 
as of this point we have not had a national title insurance 
company willing to commit glen hardymon mernicks attorney said 
tuesday but hardymon added that mernick is not the least bit 
worried it can be worked out 
one option is for the catawbas to transfer their claim from the 
land to the proceeds of the sale said don miller attorney for the 
tribe 
that option however could affect the amount of money from the 
sale that would be left for ptl creditors said ptl bankruptcy 
attorney brad leggett 
bakker who built the heritage usa christian retreat and theme 
park in fort mill left ptl in a sex and money scandal in 1987 the 
evangelical empire entered bankruptcy reorganization three months 
later 
the lawsuit has clouded more than 200 million in real estate 
transactions and has harmed economic development in the area 
according to the york county council tega cay city council and rock 
hill area chamber of commerce 
the local councils want state and federal authorities to 
negotiate a cash or land settlement with the catawbas

large parts of pennsylvania and new york if significant rain or snow 
doesnt fall soon 
the delaware river basin commission stopped short of declaring 
the emergency on tuesday saying storms last weekend and rain and

250 billion gallons or 92 percent of capacity instead they held 
about 129 billion gallons 
we are 14 billion gallons from entering the drought zone 
said david everett the commissions chief engineer 
the commission said it will declare an emergency if the 
reservoirs drop below the drought level for five consecutive days 
because of a lack of snowfall in the mountains this winter

a cockpit recording of robert 
stethems last minutes aboard a hijacked twa jetliner does not 
indicate which of two hijackers killed the us navy diver the 
planes copilot testified today 
the copilot philip maresca 46 was called to testify in the 
murder and air piracy trial of mohammed ali hamadi a lebanese 
shiite moslem who has said he helped hijack the plane in 1985 but 
did not kill stethem 
the court asked maresca to listen to the tape recording made 
during the ordeal it had hoped the staticfilled tape would help 
authorities determine who killed stethem 
the tape recording contains conversations between the cockpit of 
the hijacked plane and the control tower in beirut when the plane 
made the second of three landings in beirut 
a west german federal police phonetic expert told the court last 
week that a sound that might have been the fatal shot could be heard 
during a conversation in arabic between the hijackers and the tower 
however maresca told the court the hijackers were not talking to 
the tower and were outside the cockpit at the time of the shooting 
in order for the shot to be heard one of the microphones in 
the cockpit must have been on and i dont recall that being the 
case maresca said i did not hear the shot on the tape 
the tape was provided to the court by the us justice 
department but fbi agent gary noesner has declined to tell the 
court how it was obtained 
thirtynine americans were held hostage for 17 days in the june 
1985 hijacking of a athenstorome flight the hijacked plane was 
flown several times between algiers and beirut stethem was killed 
when the plane made its second landing in beirut on june 15 1985 
maresca said he did hear the shot in the cockpit but did not see 
who pulled the trigger when the copilot testified in november he 
told the court hamadi appeared in the cockpit moments after the 
shooting and held a gun in his hand he was not asked about this 
today 
he said hamadi did most of the talking with the tower from the 
cockpit 
in keeping with court policy on security for the former hostages 
maresca was not asked to give his current address 
hamadi has said his accomplice did most of the talking and shot 
stethem the accomplice identified in court documents as hassan 
ezzeddine is a fugitive none of the scores of witnesses who have 
testified since the trial began in july 1988 could say who shot

the regional court

suit against a government spokesman

randall dale adams is out of prison after serving 
12 years for a policemans murder to which another man has all but 
confessed but he said today he wont feel vindicated until he is 
cleared in a second trial 
in an interview on nbcs today show adams said he hopes 
questions raised by the 1988 documentary the thin blue line 
which cast doubt on his 1977 conviction and brought new attention to 
the case will be answered in a new trial 
i dont know if we can receive all the answers id like to 
have he said but i would like to receive some of them 
adams 40 once was three days from execution but was freed on 
bond tuesday after an appeals court ruled he didnt get a fair trial 
thin blue line filmmaker erroll morris said on the today 
show he felt privileged to have been involved in this whole case 
dallas county district attorney john vance said prosecutors were 
examining evidence to determine whether to retry adams assistant 
district attorney winfield scott had said earlier this week that he 
intended to seek a new trial but might reduce the charge from 
capital murder to murder 
it aint over randy schaffer adams attorney said after 
hours of wrangling that had delayed his clients release 
in an interview on abcs nightline adams was asked about the 
prospect of a retrial 
im not afraid of that now he said i believe were going 
to win and i believe we can prove it 
he traveled to houston with schaffer to lay groundwork for a new 
trial while his mother mildred adams decorated her trailer in 
grove city ohio with yellow ribbons for his return 
therell be a bunch of people to meet him at the airport she 
told the associated press then the familys just going to bring 
him home and order pizza and talk and cry for a while and just be 
glad hes home 
adams release on a 50000 personal recognizance bond was 
delayed by two days of legal wrangling in which prosecutors tried to 
have state district judge larry baraka removed from the case and had 
bond raised to 100000 cash 
but district judge ron chapman subsequently revoked the higher 
amount after talking to baraka in chambers allowing adams to be 
released without posting any money 
adams was convicted in 1977 for the nov 28 1976 killing of 
dallas patrolman robert wood but the thin blue line questioned 
the testimony of the states key witness david harris 
the then16yearold harris had picked up adams the day of the 
shooting after adams car ran out of gas after wood pulled over 
harris car adams shot the officer harris testified in the 
documentary however harris all but confessed to the shooting 
harris is on death row for another slaying but wasnt charged in 
the wood case 
the movie also showed other witnesses giving information that 
conflicted with their trial testimony 
on march 1 the texas court of criminal appeals ruled that adams 
did not receive a fair trial because witnesses lied on the stand and 
the district attorneys office supressed evidence 
adams steadfastly maintained his innocence saying harris dropped 
him off at home before the shooting occurred 
i am 40 years old and have no violence anywhere he told 
reporters tuesday the state wants you to think that for five 
minutes i went crazy thats stupid 
morris who directed the documentary said he was proud very 
proud to have focused attention on adams case 
this is not a story of how someone uses legal wrangling to get 
out of jail morris said this is the story of a miscarriage of 
justice this is the story of a man who came within three days of a 
lethal injection in huntsville 
adams original death sentence was commuted to life in prison in 
1980 
i have often wondered what would happen if the evening ever 
came when they came to my cell to take me out to my death adams 
said i often wondered if i could just walk out and go to my death 
as a man thankfully i never had to answer that

politicians on the left and right today 
indicated they would support elections in the occupied territories 
if they are linked to peace talks a condition reportedly included 
in a usbacked peace plan 
a leftwing lawmaker who met recently with officials of the 
palestine liberation organization in new york said he believes the 
plo has accepted the plan which reportedly would shut the group out 
of participation in the first stage of israelipalestinian peace 
talks 
also today a group of jews from 40 countries attending a 
conference in israel that was organized by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir adopted a resolution expressing solidarity with israel 
we are proud of israels adherence to its principles of 
democracy justice and freedom we support the democratically 
elected government of national unity in its efforts to achieve peace 
and security with its neighbors the resolution said 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip residents staged a 
general strike to mark a 1968 battle between palestinians and 
israelis six arabs were reportedly wounded by army gunfire in 
clashes in the territories 
the israeli newspaper haaretz said that under a usbacked peace 
plan israel would negotiate an interim settlement with elected 
palestinian representatives from the occupied lands 
the plo would join the talks in the second stage when a final 
settlement is negotiated haaretz said in an unattributed report 
the plo has insisted on participating in every stage of 
negotiations 
the link between the two stages is an american promise to the 
plo in the first stage that it will be included in the second 
stage yossi sarid of the leftist citizens rights movement said on 
israel radio 
this has been accepted by the plo according to my knowledge 
said sarid who recently attended a symposium on the middle east 
that also drew plo representatives sarid said his party proposed a 
similar plan recently in israels parliament 
washington has not announced such a peace plan but secretary of 
state james a baker iii said tuesday the united states believed it 
would be a major mistake to rule out eventual israeliplo talks 
if they could lead to middle east peace 
the leftleaning labor party which governs in a coalition 
government with shamirs rightwing likud bloc has said it would 
accept elections in the occupied lands defense secretary yitzhak 
rabin labors no 2 leader has repeatedly called for them 
ronnie milo minister of environmental protection and a leading 
member of the likud bloc hinted that shamir would propose elections 
in the occupied lands as part of his peace agenda to be presented 
to washington next month 
milo also suggested israel would accept the palestinian 
representatives chosen in such elections even if they sympathize 
with the plo 
im convinced that the people elected will derive their 
authority from their voters and not from sombody in tunis he 
said on israel radio 
its possible that in their hearts they feel closeness or 
sympathy for one or another group outside the territories milo 
said 
such a compromise could help break the deadlock caused by the 
plos insistence on participation in all stages of peace talks and 
israels vow never to negotiate with the group 
shamir has refused to disclose details of his peace plan 
however american jewish leaders visiting jerusalem have suggested 
that shamir and his political rival labor party leader shimon 
peres have united behind a compromise

customers shouldnt have to pay the bill 
the department of public utilities on tuesday said that the 
telephone company cannot pass along to customers an estimated 15 
million in costs associated with advertising charitable 
contributions and lobbying 
to increase sales in a monopoly market why do you need to 
advertise department commissioner bernice mcintyre said today 
the commercial series which began in july and ended on christmas 
day on television and radio in five new england states had stirred 
intense audience interest and speculation about how the 
fatherdaughter standoff would be resolved 
priests delivered sermons derived from the commercials a 
billboard urging daughter jill to call dad appeared and talk 
show hosts discussed the family drama with listeners 
the story had a happy ending and the phone company itself was 
pleased 
surveys showed an increase in customer awareness of the companys 
advertising and other telephone companies expressed interest in 
running similar campaigns the series cost the company about 5 
million 
new england telephone spokesman peter cronin said the company was 
disappointed by the departments refusal to allow recovery of 
advertising costs and contributions 
we feel strongly that such expenditures are a legitimate cost 
of doing business he said certainly charitable contributions 
are expected from responsible corporate citizens in todays 
society

a soviet military attache expelled from the united 
states on espionage charges denied in two interviews published today 
that he was a spy and he accused the fbi of setting him up 
generally i felt as if i had ended up in washington not in 
march 1989 but in a worse time of raging antisoviet hysteria 
lt col yuri pakhtusov said in an interview with the defense 
ministry newspaper red star 
in my opinion this provocation was a warning to those citizens 
of the usa who today are more frequently trying to see in the 
habitual enemy image the face of a friend and come closer to the 
soviet union he told the newspaper 
pakhtusov was arrested march 8 and ordered to leave the united 
states within 48 hours the soviet union responded a week later by 
accusing an assistant us army attache lt col daniel francis van 
gundy iii of spying and expelled him 
a us government source identified pakhtusov as a member of the 
soviet armys gru intelligence service and the fbi said his arrest 
ended a sixmonth investigation the fbi accused pakhtusov of trying 
to gather sensitive information about how the us government 
protects its computer secrets 
pakhtusov was surprised when he was offered an envelope by his 
upstairs neighbor who had invited him to his apartment to give 
pakhtusov some tips on repairing his television set he said in a 
second interview 
when i dropped in he offered me a yellow packet with the 
words here is what you need i didnt take the packet and looked 
at him in amazement pakhtusov told the newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda 
then he said at least five fbi agents burst through the 
apartment door took the american away and searched the apartment 
pakhtusov said the agents handcuffed him and took him away without 
allowing him to call his embassy or alert his family 
pakhtusov said he still likes and respects americans but that 
improved relations between the superpowers frightens some 
influential people

antiapartheid leaders issued a 
detailed report today accusing police of initiating violence and 
supporting vigilante groups in the vicious blackonblack faction 
fighting in natal province 
more than 1000 blacks have been killed in the past 18 months in 
townships around the cities of pietermaritzburg and durban 
the main combatants are the banned united democratic front the 
nations largest antiapartheid coalition and inkatha a political 
organization headed by zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi 
the udf accused police of siding with inkatha by encouraging and 
participating in attacks on udf members and by refusing to prosecute 
inkatha members 
vigilante violence has flourished through both omissions and 
the active participation of the south african police said jay 
naidoo general secretary of the congress of south african trade 
unions which has close ties to the udf 
a report compiled by the udf and the labor federation detailed 29 
attacks that occurred in imbali a township outside 
pietermaritzburg in november december and january it said inkatha 
members were responsible for 16 attacks police initiated three 
incidents antiapartheid activists launched three attacks and seven 
were carried out by unidentified people 
the report named several inkatha members who repeatedly have been 
implicated by residents for taking part in attacks but have never 
been charged by police 
residents could only conclude that police were acting in 
concert with the wrongdoers or that there were two separate systems 
of justice operating one for inkatha members and a completely 
separate system for residents not belonging to inkatha the report 
said 
naidoo said there have been about 10 successful prosecutions 
stemming from the hundreds of killings 
from the top down we believe police have the attitude that 
inkatha is an ally and other groups are considered the enemy said 
nicholas haysom a human rights lawyer 
police have denied taking sides in the natal conflict which 
commanders say is expanding despite an increased security presence 
police brig jack buchner who is in charge of quelling the 
violence in pietermaritzburg said earlier this month that teenage 
assassination squads made up of udf and inkatha members were 
responsible for most of the killings 
inkatha leaders say they are seeking peace in the region but 
acknowlege they are not able to exercise direct control over some of 
their young supporters 
inkatha and the udf signed a peace accord last year but the 
violence has continued since then at roughly the same level 
buthelezi and inkatha oppose apartheid but they do not 
participate in protests boycotts sanctions or other 
confrontational methods favored by the udf many antiapartheid 
groups have accused buthelezi of being a government collaborator 
because he participates in the black homeland system

a band of minnesota chippewa indians says the 
minnesota civil liberties union and the state board of education 
shouldnt bother trying to eliminate indian nicknames from schools 
we view the use of indian names as a point of pride if they are 
used respectfully and in good taste myron ellis a representative 
on the 3000member leech lake bands governing body said tuesday 
the statement was the first official protest by an indian 
government against a campaign to rid schools of team names such as 
indians chiefs and warriors 
the mclu said the campaign which includes threats to sue up to 
50 districts if they dont change team names was designed to stop 
disparaging references to indians the push prompted the board of 
education to urge schools to drop indian emblems and symbols many 
schools are discussing the question 
however some indian leaders said the mclu and education 
officials neglected to ask indians how they felt about the issue 
we are opposed to the action of the mclu and we question their 
authority to speak on our behalf ellis said 
ellis said the lake leech band conducted a survey and the vast 
of our people do not have a problem with the various school 
districts using indian names to represent their teams 
matthew stark mclu associate director said he needed to study 
the leech lake action before commenting 
right now the plan is that at a certain point we go to federal 
court and go forward with the litigation he said i will say 
that its delightful that this whole issue is being discussed

new york citys powerful board of estimate must 
be reapportioned to meet equalvoting standards the supreme court 
ruled today 
by a 90 vote the justices said the boards composition violates 
the rights of those in the citys more populous boroughs they 
upheld a lower court ruling that requires a new plan that meets the 
oneperson onevote standard 
the courts ruling may have limited impact outside of new york 
city since the board of estimate appears to be a unique governing 
body 
justice byron r white in his opinion for the court said the 
underrepresentation on the board for the citys largest boroughs is 
severe rejecting arguments by city officials that the makeup 
legitimately balances regional interests 
he said a voter is shortchanged if he may vote for one 
representative and the voters in another district half the size also 
elect one representative 
the board includes the mayor the city council president and the 
city comptroller each with two votes on the board in addition 
the president of each of the citys five boroughs is a board member 
with one vote apiece 
the city population is more than 7 million with wide disparities 
in the size of the boroughs broooklyn has some 22 million people 
queens 19 million manhattan 14 million the bronx 12 million and 
staten island 350000 
the boards responsibilities include determining the use 
development and improvement of city property negotiating city 
contracts awarding franchises and leasing property setting water 
and sewer rates making zoning decisions and tax abatements

even while trying to convince fellow house 
republicans that he could be as reasonable as the next guy newt 
gingrich couldnt bank the fire within 
at a news conference called last week to show off his charm the 
georgia congressman wound up belitting fellow republicans who might 
be shy about installing a scorchedearth firebrand as their partys 
no 2 leader in the house 
gingrichs election today as party whip is seen as a watershed 
for the future of the party and maybe for the future of relations 
between the parties 
at issue was whether republicans wanted to promote a guerrilla 
who believes that combat is the normal condition in congress he 
also is democratic house speaker jim wrights principal tormentor 
gingrich 45 berates his republican colleagues for a hatinhand 
approach to the democrats who run the place they have developed a 
permanent minority mentality he says they havent been in the 
majority since he was 11 
we tend to say oh gee theyre in charge how can we be nice 
enough to them that theyll let us pretend were part of the game 
gingrich told reporters i represent the wing of the party that 
says fine well take up that challenge 
so the 174member gop minority was asked to choose between 
gingrich and rep ed madigan of illinois a conciliator of the 
getalong goalong school toward which gingrich feels such 
contempt the vote tally wasnt given 
madigan is a perfectly fine representative of the classic 
legislative model of a whip he said with faint praise if 
thats what the party wants and it would prefer to remain in the 
minority 
the vacancy opened when president bush installed republican whip 
dick cheney in the pentagon after the senate rejected john tower 
within minutes gingrich was on the phone lining up votes in a 
bid to move from backbench to front line 
his promise is that the tactic that made him a republican folk 
hero can create a republican house majority 
the tactic carry house battles off the floor to the nation let 
the public see the light and make congress feel the heat 
televisions the trick when the cspan cable network started 
carrying uninterrupted house sessions gingrich and other 
articulate ideological and largely ignored conservatives discovered 
an audience out there 
wed fly to some small town in the midwest and people at a 
cocktail party would know what went on that day in congress 
marveled a republican spokesman steve lotterer reflecting on 
cspans impact 
when gingrich attacked democrats as blind to communism thomas p 
oneill jr then the speaker took offense he considered curbing 
television thought better of it finally ordered the cameras to pan 
the deserted chamber to show the home audience these conservatives 
were talking to themselves 
once oneill let his contempt show forswearing the chair the 
speaker took the floor wagged a finger at gingrich accused him of 
the lowest thing ive seen in my 32 years in congress and 
underwent the humiliation of being ruled out of order for his 
personal attack 
gingrich has that ability to make people react he is a forceful 
debater his sentences pour out rounded parsed suitable for 
framing 
the son of a career soldier he was born in harrisburg pa but 
adopted georgia divorced and remarried he is a baptist deacon he 
taught history and environmental studies at west georgia college and 
ran for congress three times before winning 
he once spent 24 hours in a wheelchair saying he wanted to 
better understand the handicapped 
he introduced a bill in 1981 to provide for new american states 
in outer space and proposed a plan in 1982 to industrialize and 
militarize space 
he has proposed a way to replace social security he groused that 
the reagan administration was feeding the liberal welfare state 
instead of changing it and he irked conservatives by pressuring 
south africa to get rid of apartheid 
in 1985 he portrayed a forthcoming meeting between president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as potentially the most 
dangerous summit for the west since adolf hitler met with neville 
chamberlain in 1938 at munich 
for years gingrich waged a lonely campaign to have wright 
investigated the effort took off when common cause the liberal 
public affairs lobby echoed gingrichs call giving him 
respectability 
gingrich has attacked wright for a weird financing 
arrangement for a book but he was embarrassed this week by the 
disclosure of an unorthodox financing arrangement of his own that 
provided tax benefits to friends who underwrote promotion of a 
gingrich book

pounds will be taken by van to cape canaveral and then carried by 
boat 20 miles offshore for release ms moore said 
the area is known to be inhabited by populations of coastal 
dolphins she said were hoping to find a nice group of 
dolphins to release him in 
the national marine fisheries service appproved the release the 
federal agency also authorized rascals rescue from broad bay at

rep edward madigan of illinois is known as a 
behindthescenes operator with a quiet nonconfrontational 
approach to accomplishing republican purposes in the house of 
representatives 
but his colleagues opted today for another approach choosing the 
brash and outspoken newt gingrich of georgia for the post of house 
minority whip 
although madigan doesnt run to the television cameras to condemn 
the democrats at every turn dont tell him hes not a partisan 
i am damned mad about these suggestions that somebody else 
might be more of a republican than i am he said and he can 
recite partybuilding credentials spanning two decades he is he 
says someone who knows how republicans can become a majority in 
the congress even if hes not loud about it 
his approach to the democrats isnt to shoot at them as gingrich 
does but to set an example of how governing should be done 
they are playing different games said the authors of the 
almanac of american politics in their 1988 profile of madigan 
newt gingrich and company want to change opinion in the country 
confident that congress will come to reflect it madigan wants to 
change policy in the house confident that he can improve the way 
government serves the people 
madigan is the antithesis of the confrontationists of the 
conservative opportunity society the group gingrich leads said 
the almanac 
while gingrich puts down madigan as the choice of republicans who 
want to stay in the minority madigan says little about his 
opponent i think the republican party has an excellent choice 
he said 
he also turned away speculation that his race for whip was a 
prelude to succeeding bob michel rill as house minority leader 
im not a candidate for leader he said i have no ambition 
to be leader i think its a lousy job clearly the backroom 
work of the whip who counts votes and enforces the party positions 
on legislation appeals to his private personality 
i dont want to go to all those damned banquets he said of 
the leaders job 
madigan 53 turned from running a taxi business to politics in 
1966 when he was elected to the illinois state legislature after 
chairing the redistricting committee he was elected to congress in 
1972 
through a series of good committee positions he soon became a 
significant force within the house and has paid his dues to the 
party 
he was off the house agriculture committee in 1981 and 1982 but 
reclaimed his seat instead of pursuing other goals in 1983 as 
ranking republican at the behest of party leadership in order to 
prevent vermonts liberal republican james jeffords from getting the 
position 
madigan who represents a prosperous farming area has been an 
opponent of farm bill provisions that he considers overgenerous and 
led the fight against a democratic proposal for a farmers 
referendum to limit grain production 
he also serves on the energy and commerce committee which has 
been an important forum for economic issues and under the leadership 
of chairman john dingell dmich is considered the most powerful 
committee in the house 
a specialist on transportation madigan advocated sale of the 
conrail freight train system with interests in health and clean 
air he has pushed for organ transplant legislation and opposed acid 
rain bills 
hes known for having a good sense of humor but avoids 
gladhanding and is appreciated as a straightshooter who maintains 
orderly working relationships with democrats

house republicans today elected conservative 
rep newt gingrich to the post of minority whip a move toward the 
politics of confrontation that the georgia congressman represents 
its more a commentary that the party is ready to be aggressive 
and dynamic and reach out and that they wanted a new 
definition gingrich said after his election over veteran rep 
edward madigan of illinois 
the vote in a closed caucus at the capitol hill club was 8785 
with one ballot cast for other one of the 174 house republicans 
was not present 
gingrich appeared later at a news conference at the side of gop 
house leader bob michel the voice of the moderates who have ruled 
the gop in its decades of minority status in the house michel had 
quietly backed madigan for the job 
gingrich sought to play down differences in his party i think 
you will find this to be a team effort he said its not a 
conservative activist victory it is the entire repubican team 
if this election had been a test of bob michels leadeership i 
wouldnt have gotten 40 votes gingrich added if bob michel 
stood up and said this is a test of my leadership a vote of 
confidence in me he would have a won and b i would have 
withdrawn 
gingrich replaces dick cheney of wyoming who resigned his house 
seat and the no 2 post in the house gop leadership to become 
secretary of defense 
cheney addressed the meeting briefly before rep henry hyde of 
illinois who had been the subject of a draft attempt asked that he 
not be considered because he had not announced for the post 
before the vote the madigangingrich race had been viewed as an 
indicator of whether the party would seek the cooperative relations 
that president bush espouses or declare war on the democrats who 
greatly outnumber them in the house 
gingrich 45 appealed to the republican house members with a 
pitch that hes a national republican who will lead them from 
the desert of more than three decades in the minority 
gingrichs strident attacks on house speaker jim wright dtexas 
which led to an ethics committee investigation gained him backing 
among republicans of all ideological stripes who sought to lash out 
in frustration 
but gingrich was also personally controversial and as the 
election approached he was fighting off questions about an unusual 
deal where he got political supporters to help finance publicity for 
a book he had published 
madigan 53 was the favorite of what one member called the 
institutional republicans he insisted that within the house 
republicans needed to make themselves players in the legislative 
game sometimes working with the democrats he said republicans 
best shot at taking over the house is with redistricting candidate 
recruitment and financing not trying to bring down the house 
while gingrich was holding news conferences about his candidacy 
madigan worked quietly without ever directly attacking gingrich 
on the eve of the election both announced candidates were 
claiming to have majorities in addition people leading the 
movement to draft hyde claimed they had 40 votes 
the level of intrigue in the race clearly exceeded all 
expectations 
i did not know there could be this much action created over a 
whip race said rep jack buechner rmo 
gingrichs neoconservative politics and his accusatory style are 
anathema to many house democrats and gingrich supporter bob walker 
rpa accused the democratic leadership tuesday of trying to sway 
the election by threatening him with ethics charges 
obviously the democrats in this body feel they have a big 
stake in trying to prevent mr gingrichs election said walker 
portraying gingrich as a man the democrats feared 
but for the most part the majority democrats were watching the 
race with more curiosity than concern 
i think the institution does better with madigan and democrats 
do better with newt said rep barney frank dmass gingrich 
produces great unity among the democrats he said and as a 
result diminishes the republican role 
rep pat williams dmont made clear that democrats didnt mind 
seeing the republicans fighting among themselves 
we view it as the ax murderer against the defense lawyer he 
said

statesmanjournal salem ore on underground storage tanks 
new federal rules for underground petroleum tanks have created 
new protection for the public and new costs for service stations 
schools hospitals and other businesses 
in the long run and despite the inconvenience and hairsplitting 
that will follow the safety of our environment is at stake 
requirements imposed by the us environmental protection agency 
and the state department of environmental quality should help snuff 
the fuse of a smoldering bomb gasoline or chemical tanks rusting 
and polluting the water table and surrounding land 
those requirements also are helping drive some small service 
stations out of business a sad fact that we all lament farmers 
and others also will feel the pressure 
recognition of the danger of underground storage tanks was slow 
to translate into action the new laws are costly but they are less 
than the cost of a cleanup

the newsleader springfield mo on irs tax advice 
the television commercial suggests that the american taxpayer let 
his fingers do the walking by calling a tollfree number taxpayers 
are advised they can get friendly advice from the irs about tax 
preparations 
maybe its the thought that counts when it comes to reliable 
advice a study by the general accounting office suggests the irs is 
wrong 40 percent of the time 
for its part the irs is willing to admit its in error 308 
percent of the time it advises taxpayers 
theres got to be a better way instead of tv commercials and 
bad advice maybe the irs should concentrate on making the tax codes 
understandable and leave the advice to the experts who do taxes for 
a living with friends like the irs who needs enemies

wheeling wva newsregister on dan quayle and john tower 
while president bush is to be commended for the manner in which 
he took the john tower defeat he may have to make some effort to 
get his vice president on the administration team 
for at the same time the president was announcing his new choice 
for secretary of defense vice president dan quayle was in 
indiana denouncing senate democrats for engaging in a mccarthyite 
mudslinging campaign against tower 
most observers felt the vice presidents speech had undercut 
the president who seemed much more conciliatory toward congress 
there was some disappointment however that the president 
dismissed a question about quayles remarks saying he speaks for 
himself 
whatever damage was done can be shortlived if the vice president 
doesnt continue to go around spouting off his blistering remarks 
about the opposition

las vegas reviewjournal on john tower and jim wright 
the democrats in the us senate worked with john tower as a 
fellow senator for many years finding him fit and competent to 
serve in that capacity and chair one of the most powerful senate 
committees 
but when tower wanted the job of defense secretary his former 
colleagues turned on him viciously and drummed him out of public 
service 
towers heinous crime besides being a conservative was that 
reports about drunkenness and skirtchasing dogged his tracks too 
closely and the appearance of immoderate behavior doomed him 
now lets shift our focus to the us house of representatives 
presided over by one jim wright democrat of texas and third in line 
of succession to the presidency 
want to talk about appearances 
how does it look when wright takes a staggering 55 percent 
royalty on the sale of his vapid book most of the copies of which 
were sold in bulk to those noted literary critics the teamsters 
union a heavy contributor to guess whos campaigns 
what appearance is given when the speaker of the house 
publicly blabs classified details of cia activity in nigaragua 
the house ethics committee after nine long months of 
footdragging is finally poised to release its findings about 
wright 
if the democrats in the senate felt secure in bludgeoning 
tower for exhibiting the appearance of immoderate behavior then 
congress should seek wrights scalp if the ethics committee 
discovers not apparent but actual improprieties

west central tribune willmar minn on assault rifles 
banning the import of assault rifles is not going to prevent 
another random massacre there always will be people who would 
do such a thing if not with an assault rifle by any other means 
this is getting close to the national rifle associations 
argument that guns dont kill people people kill people 
this is true but patrick purdy who rampaged through the 
stockton calif school yard on jan 17 with an assault rifle 
killing five children before turning a pistol on himself never 
would have been able to inflict such tragedy had he been armed with 
a knife a baseball bat or even a less devastating firearm 
americans do not want to see the right to bear arms severely 
limited but there is growing public sentiment against assault 
rifles and similar deadly firearms 
the nra which usually lashes out blindly against any perceived 
attack on the right to bear arms should be a good citizen and take 
the lead in clamping down on semiautomatic military weapons it will 
help one of its most prominent members achieve the goal of a 
kinder gentler nation

the arizona republic phoenix on restructuring soviet 
agriculture 
mikhail gorbachevs plan for restructuring soviet agriculture is 
being hailed as the greatest thing since canned caviar 
even the communist party central committee and the ruling 
politburo whose usual approach to change is as cool as a siberian 
frost have warmed to the proposed privatization 
the linchpin in the reform is longterm leasing of stateowned 
land under gorbachevs bold initiative private farmers would 
be allowed to lease state land for life at present 15 years is the 
limit and pass it on to their children 
the driving force behind this hard turn toward privatization is 
the crushing need to increase productivity under the marxist system 
food production has lagged to the point where shortages have 
become the rule 
if the gorbachev plan is given an honest trial which it may not 
be if past reform efforts are any gauge the kremlin may discover 
what everyone else already knows that capitalism is not all bad 
until then soviet farmers must be thankful for half a loaf in the 
fat years

the westerly ri sun on freedom of expression 
some notably fatuous behavior garnered much publicity for the 
radio talk show host tom leykis of kfiam in los angeles 
this piece of folly demonstrated abysmal failure to grasp the 
principle of free expression though leykis conspicously benefits by 
that freedom in his work he besmeared it with a goonish act of 
destruction 
the popular musician cat stevens who became a muslim convert a 
decade ago and changed his name to yousuf islam appears to have 
endorsed the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis fanatical death sentence 
pronounced against salman rushdie because of his novel the satanic 
verses 
leykis chose to respond by getting together a batch of cat 
stevens records and tapes and crunching them with a steamroller the 
message he said was we endorse the right of the american 
people to read think and say whatever they want to 
bravo but those fine words were perhaps unwittingly rejected the 
next moment when the man ceremoniously destroyed records and 
tapes which exemplified intellectual freedom

organized by congress in 1972 to salvage the remains of a 
transcontinental rail system from bankrupt private railroads amtrak 
now carries 22 million passengers a year 
ridership in 1988 rose on some lines as much as 24 percent 
revenues were up too 14 percent higher than the year before 
in 1981 the federal government provided 52 percent of operating 
costs by last year the subsidy level had dropped to 30 percent 
amtrak wants a boost in this years budget to buy equipment and to 
upgrade service 
for the last five years amtrak has fought off attempts by former 
president reagan to eliminate its subsidies during his campaign 
george bush also said he would end amtrak subsidies 
if amtrak can sustain its present momentum it could reach 
selfsufficiency in the 1990s but even if it failed it would be 
imprudent to cut the subsidy and drive amtrak into the hands of 
private owners who would be free to cut service and abolish whole 
routes 
to pay its own way amtrak needs help for several years longer 
it has more than earned the chance

green bay wis pressgazette on beer drinking by college 
students 
what does the phrase spring break call to mind 
how about a sunburned oversexed beersoaked collegian berserk 
on a gulf coast beach while that picture is sometimes accurate 
there are those who want to change it 
the kids taught their elders specifically the older generation 
at the miller brewing co a few things 
the lesson started in late february when miller prepared a 
16page color ad supplement and paid to insert it in 55 college 
newspapers the supplement was to be a tongueincheek guide to fun 
in the sun but it went too far students complained we agree 
we blew it said millers marketing and public relations 
manager in a letter of apology to student papers the brewery pulled 
the supplement from 10 papers and canceled plans to distribute it in 
southern beach areas during spring break 
millers admission of a mistake is admirable but the brewery was 
pushed into that action by students offended by inappropriate 
material 
there is nothing funny about sexism or alcohol abuse that is a 
lesson youngsters should be taught by their elders not the other 
way around

vicksburg miss evening post on steroid use 
after olympic gold medalist ben johnson disgraced himself and 
dismayed all of canada when tests showed he had used anabolic 
steroids the canadian government asked a commission to look into 
the issue of drug abuse among its amateur athletes 
testimony taken by this impressive inquiry is turning up evidence 
that the problem goes well beyond sprinter johnson 
that should come as no surprise nor should anyone be so naive as 
to think that the problem is confined to canadian athletes if 
anything the canadian situation is probably typical 
the message coming out of the inquiry seems to be that nothing 
short of a cooperative effort among nations will wipe out the 
problem 
already the united states and the soviet union have agreed to 
permit each side to begin testing the others athletes for drug use 
well before the start of the next olympics 
a voluntary program of this kind in the past would have added 
integrity to amateur sports and might have spared johnson his 
fall from public grace

the usrecognized president of panama has moved to 
miami but says he will continue to slip in and out of his homeland 
to aid the opposition to military ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
president eric arturo delvalle was removed in february 1988 when 
he tried to fire noriega in the wake of drug indictments against him 
in miami and tampa that touched off a crisis between the united 
states and noriegas government with washington continuing to 
recognize delvalle as panamas constitutional leader 
delvalle who had been hiding out in panama said in todays 
miami herald that he and his family moved to miami two months ago 
and bought a home at an exclusive condominium 
this will be my base delvalle said i will continue doing 
politics full time until my term expires in august and then ill 
dedicate myself to doing business 
delvalle was scheduled to meet with secretary of state james a 
baker iii in washington later today 
the last time delvalle was in panama was in march when he taped 
a speech for a clandestine tv station supporting opposition 
candidate guillermo endara in the may 7 presidential elections 
endara is running against pronoriega candidate carlos duque 
delvalle said he expected noriega to fix the elections for duque 
the opposition has to go to the polls because it has no other 
alternative delvalle said but it will all be useless 
he said he is pessimistic about the near future in panama and 
does not feel the election will solve the political crisis 
the elections will probably lead to a definitive break in 
uspanamanian relations he said panama is likely to end up 
as the poorest country in the americas

a retired cia employee today contradicted grand 
jury testimony he gave two years ago telling the jury at the oliver 
north trial he was not trying to protect the fired white house aide 
when he told lies about a security system at norths home 
glenn robinette said today he was trying to protect north 
codefendant richard secord when robinette covered up in an april 
22 1987 grand jury appearance the fact that secord had paid for a 
13800 security fence robinette also testified at that time that 
an exchange of phony backdated bills and correspondence between him 
and north was real and accurate 
one of the 12 criminal charges against north is that he accepted 
an illegal gratuity because the fence was installed free of charge 
to him 
prosecutor john keker asked robinette whether in his false 
testimony in 1987 he was trying to protect anybody besides 
general secord 
no replied robinette 
asked whether he cared about protecting north robinette said i 
didnt care about protecting him and mentioned the false statement 
denying that secord had paid for the north security system 
secord who had been enlisted by north to run arms to the 
contras is charged with paying north an illegal gratuity in 
connection with the fence 
keker later delved into a may 22 1987 grand jury appearance in 
which robinette recanted the false testimony he had given the 
previous month 
asked in that later grand jury appearance why he had lied 
earlier robinette responded to protect col north and to protect 
gen secord 
keker asked robinette today whether he recalled his earlier 
statements saying he was trying to protect north 
no i dont remember them replied robinette he said 
perhaps he should have mentioned secords name first in his 
earlier testimony but i certainly stand by them 
a 21year retired veteran of the cia robinette on tuesday told 
how secord paid him 16000 for installing the 13800 security 
system 
in december 1986 after being fired from the white house north 
telephoned robinette saying hey buddy you never sent me a bill 
for that security work you did for me in mid1986 the excia 
employee said 
robinette responded by sending two phony backdated bills to 
north who then sent two backdated letters to robinette norths 
letters characterized the security fence as a loan of equipment 
which would be removed when north left the marines in the backdated 
letters north offered as payment a commercial endorsement of 
robinettes firm and the security equipment 
prosecutors are moving into the final phase of their case 
focusing on his alleged coverup as millions of dollars were 
diverted in the irancontra affair 
willard zucker a lawyer and accountant who used to work for the 
internal revenue service and now lives in geneva switzerland 
testified how in october 1984 he began a project to purchase some 
arms or munitions or both at the request of irancontra 
codefendant albert hakim 
hakim and secord were business partners and zucker moved money 
for them in the irancontra affair 
one of the charges against north a former national security 
council aide is that he lied to the attorney general by saying the 
nsc had no involvement in the diversion of money to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
zucker funneled money from the arms sales into accounts 
controlled by hakim and codefendant richard secord north had 
secretly enlisted secord to run arms to the contras 
former attorney general edwin meese iii also will testify at 
norths trial in the next week and a half as the prosecution wraps 
up its case north lawyer brendan sullivan said he expects the 
defense case to last four to eight weeks 
one of meeses exaides charles cooper will testify how north 
suggested that congress be told that no one in the us government 
knew at the time that a november 1985 shipment to iran contained 
weapons 
the cia assisted on the shipment of missiles which was made 
without a required presidential finding 
norths former secretary fawn hall also is scheduled to testify 
during congressional testimony and depositions hall described 
how documents were shredded altered and removed from the nsc in 
midnovember 1986 at norths direction 
the allegedly altered documents outlined norths involvement with 
the contras at a time when congress had banned aid to them

willie bosket a thrill killer at 15 and 
avowed monster used his knowledge of the criminal justice 
system hes been part of since childhood today to postpone his 
sentencing for stabbing a prison guard 
the 26yearold bosket described by a prosecutor as a walking 
talking advertisement for capital punishment objected when a 
presentencing report was handed to him just 15 minutes before he 
was to be sentenced 
bosket has served as his own defense in the case state law says 
a defendant is entitled to the presentencing report at least 24 
hours before sentencing 
ulster county court judge francis vogt ordered that bosket be 
brought back to court thursday morning he could receive 15 years to 
life for stabbing guard earl porter last april at shawangunk 
correctional facility 
bosket who is known as the states most dangerous inmate has 
been in and out of courtrooms since he was 9 when he was put in 
reform school at his mothers request his early record led the 
state to toughen its juvenile criminal laws 
at his trial last month bosket defended himself and declared 
that the justice system itself was on trial 
i laugh at this system because there aint a damn thing that it 
can do to me except to deal with the monster that it has created 
he said 
bosket who was convicted last month already is serving 28 years 
to life for assault arson and for being a persistent felon 
in 1978 at age 15 bosket murdered two men during robberies on 
new york city subways saying he killed for the experience he 
was tried as a juvenile and sentenced to five years but a public 
outcry prompted the legislature to enact laws allowing juveniles as 
young as 13 to be tried as adults for murder 
despite several violent acts in youth detention centers 
including smashing a lead pipe into a guards skull bosket was 
back on the streets in 1983 he was back in prison the following 
year for shooting a nearly blind elderly man on the subways 
donald williams the assistant district attorney who prosecuted 
bosket has called him a walking talking advertisement for the 
death penalty 
new york lawmakers are seeking the votes needed to override a 
death penalty veto by gov mario cuomo 
even before he attacked porter boskets prison history was 
filled with violent acts including nine assaults on staff members

woodbourne where bosket spends 23 hours a day in solitary 
confinement his meals are slipped in through a slot and television 
cameras monitor his every move 
when bosket leaves his cell he must first stick his feet through 
a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be cuffed three guards

manacled in a small fencedin area 
hes an extremely dangerous person state corrections

prime minister margaret thatcher is defending her 
embattled transport secretary against allegations he was slow to 
warn airlines of a new type of palestinian terrorist bomb prior to 
the blast that downed flight 103 
but british newspapers today kept up the attack on paul channon 
accusing him of bungling the warnings and of leaking incorrect 
information to the media 
a west german newspaper bild today reported that a 39yearold 
arab suspected of staging terrorist attacks in italy and greece 
planned the bombing of the pan am jetliner in west germany where 
the flight originated 
a west german prosecutor denied the report but said authorities 
are looking for the man identified as samir khadar in connection 
with terrorist attacks unrelated to flight 103 
britains largest circulation newspaper the sun today called 
for channons resignation and the independent predicted he would be 
forced out 
mrs thatcher told the house of commons during an emergency 
debate called tuesday by the opposition labor party that totally 
unfair accusations have been made against him by lesser men 
channon denied in an angry exchange that he had bungled the 
warnings and that after the attack he had concealed from parliament 
the international alert about the discovery of a bomb concealed in a 
radiocassette player 
a similar bomb blew up pan am flight 103 up over scotland on dec 
21 killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground the flight 
originated in frankfurt west germany with a change of planes at 
londons heathrow airport 
i told parliament all i could channon said in 
investigations where there are also important security matters it is 
essential that all of us exercise a certain degree of restraint 
critics accuse the 54yearold channon of improper conduct of 
bungling the warnings from west german and us authorities and of 
concealing information 
channon also denied charges that to try to distract attention 
from the furor surrounding him he leaked a false report last week 
to british journalists that police knew the bombers identity 
the leftleaning guardian one of londons quality newspapers 
said channons statement to parliament offered little solace to 
those relatives of people killed at lockerbie who believe that 
intending passengers ought also to have been warned of the risks 
they might be running 
the latest controversy follows a newspaper disclosure thursday 
that the department of transport warned british airlines on nov 22 
about the radiocassette player bomb west german authorities seized 
when it arrested 13 alleged members of a palestinian terror group in 
late october 
the transport department dated a more detailed warning dec 19 
but only mailed that to british us and other foreign airlines 
operating from british airports in the second week of january well 
after the disaster 
the federal aviation administration sent the warning to us 
airlines including pan am on nov 18 
channon reiterated that the dec 19 warning was unimportant 
although copies show it contained additional information about the 
physical appearance and inner workings of the radiocassette bomb 
he said it was delayed because photographs were being prepared 
and then because some officials dealing with its dispatch were 
caught up in the disaster aftermath

minister lara bonilla in 1984 
other major figures among the 30 indicted were everette 
bannister a close friend of pindlings as well as reputed cartel 
kingpins jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha jorge ochoa vasquez fabio 
ochoa vasquez and gonzalo mejia 
us attorney robert w genzman said the indictment covers 1974 
to the present and involved the importation of 44000 pounds of 
cocaine 
the prosecutor refused to answer questions about continuing 
allegations that pindling himself was involved in the drug operation 
the document charges that barry seal an informant for the drug 
enforcment administration was killed at the direction of fabio 
ochoa escobar and other cartel members 
also indicted today was jack carlton reed codefendant of cartel 
leader carlos lehder rivas they were convicted here last year of 
conspiring to import cocaine and lehder is serving a life sentence 
the case was investigated after the trial of carlos lehder who 
is named as a coconspirator in the indictment as a followup to the 
trial said genzman 
the indictment accuses many of the defendants of running a 
continuing criminal enterprise punishable by a maximum life 
sentence and conspiracy to import drugs 
bannister who lives in nassau is charged with receiving bribes 
to allow the cartel to use islands just off florida as a way station 
for drug shipments 
genzman said the united states would seek extradition of 
bannister as for the cartel leaders he noted it had taken six 
years to get lehder to the united states and expressed belief the 
others would eventually be brought to justice 
gorman bannister everette bannisters son is a protected 
federal witness who testified the lehder trial 
during the trial bannister characterized his father chairman of 
bahamas world airlines and a consultant to resorts international as 
an influencepeddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglers 
and regularly supplied pindling with money 
in 1987 the younger bannister wearing a hood testified before 
a senate subcommittee about drugrelated corruption in the bahamas 
bannister testified at lehders trial that his father took money 
from lehder and former jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smuggler 
edward hayes ward to help protect them from law enforcement 
my father said he made a deal with carlos to get 100000 a 
month to make normans cay operational bannister testified in 
february 1988 referring to lehders island transshipment point in 
the bahamas 40 miles from nassau 
gorman bannister said that his father who had access to police 
intelligence information also had warned lehder about impending 
raids on normans cay 
several witnesses in the lehder trial testified that they had 
made payoffs to high bahamian officials 
the chief prosecution witness edward ward said he gave bahamian 
cabinet minister george smith and everette bannister 100000 that 
was supposed to go to pindling 
george william baron iii testified in lehders trial that he paid 
bribes to pindling he said he handed a briefcase containing 
4000000 in a crowded casino lounge in september or october 1980 to 
pindling 
pindling has since denied the allegation in 1984 the royal 
bahamian commission cleared him of any wrongdoing concerning 
allegations that he took payoffs from drug smugglers pindling 
first elected in 1967 was reelected in 1987

each other in water colored green yellow blue and red and hurled 
paint at each other to celebrate holi which ushers in spring and is 
dedicated to kama the hindu god of pleasure 
the day symbolizes the triumph of good over evil by commemorating 
the destruction of the demon woman holika 
but many shun the celebration throwing colors on unwilling 
people is banned but anyone on the street is fair game many women 
stay home 
during the festival authorities say women are routinely 
molested in what is euphemistically called eveteasing 
eveteasing ranges from flirting singing sexy songs and pinching to 
insults unwanted hugs and sometimes rape 
hindus believe kama carries a bow made of sugar cane and shoots 
passiontipped arrows of flowers they aspire to get hit by one of 
the arrows

a prosecutor argued today that five men 
charged in a 7 million wells fargo robbery used code names because 
they are criminals not modernday robin hoods working for puerto 
rican independence and the poor 
the five men are charged with planning the 1983 robbery 
transporting the money or using some of it to buy holiday toys for 
poor children they were not charged with committing the robbery 
itself 
the robbery of the wells fargo depot in west hartford is the 
secondlargest cash heist in us history 
in closing arguments today and tuesday assistant us attorney 
carmen espinosa van kirk said the defendants will try to convince 
the jury they had to engage in elaborate schemes and use code names 
because they are nationalist revolutionaries 
both the prosecution and defense agree that the robbery was 
committed by wells fargo guard victor m gerena who fled the 
country 
but van kirk said the 700 pieces of evidence and 100 witnesses 
presented during the fivemonth trial proved the five men were part 
of a network that planned the crime and spirited the money into the 
hands of los macheteros a puerto rican independence group 
she also asserted that the government had proved that a 
defendant juan segarra palmer planned the robbery and helped 
gerena flee she said palmer 39 was caught in a wiretapped 
conversation discussing how they could embrace a robin hood image 
he was talking about a robin hood image because it was stolen 
money van kirk said what exactly did robin hood do he stole 
from the rich and gave to the poor 
if they wanted to help the puerto ricans of hartford why 
didnt they go to park street and give away 7 million she said 
referring to a hispanic neighborhood 
the four other men on trial in us district court either helped 
transport the money first to massachusetts and then to mexico or 
used some of it to buy holiday gifts for poor children van kirk 
said 
all of these acts are part of one big conspiracy she said 
she said los macheteros used an elaborate system of code names to 
make it difficult for the government to prove who was actually 
involved in the crime but noted that the organization itself issued 
a communique in october 1984 claiming credit for seizing the 71 
million from the very bowels of american imperialism 
its the best face they can put on their case said defense 
attorney leonard weinglass who is representing segarra its 
thorough it appears comprehensive but it also acknowleges the 
weakness of their case 
the five men have been on trial since oct 11 1988 nine other 
defendants are to be tried later and two including segarras wife 
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
only a small part of the money has been recovered the government 
contends some of it is in cuba where gerena is believed to be 
living and the rest was sent to puerto rico 
segarra 39 a harvard graduate who the government contends is a 
leader of los macheteros is accused of planning and organizing the 
robbery helping gerena escape transporting and laundering stolen 
money and organizing the holiday toy giveaway with some of the 
loot he faces 150 years in prison if convicted on all 16 counts 
with which he is charged 
he has conceded that he knew gerena and that he received the 
stolen money to distribute to los macheteros but he denies that he 
planned or participated in the robbery

president bush came to the pennsylvania 
dutch country today to declare drug abuse a national problem 
that leaves no communities immune from the death and destruction of 
narcotics 
bush resumed a traveling campaign to tout his more than 5 
billion drugfighting effort and to urge community leaders to help 
educate young americans to the dangers of drug abuse 
the president was accompanied here by his drug control policy 
director william j bennett who has been weighing strategies for 
combatting rampant drugrelated violence in the nations capital 
bush traveled here by helicopter from washington and flew on 
later to wilmington del where he met with community organizations 
fighting drug abuse in that industrial city and addressed law 
enforcement officials 
the drug trade is not an issue that involves shades of gray 
he said in the delaware speech it involves good guys and bad 
guys white hats and black hats good and evil 
we often think of drug abuse as an urban innercity 
phenomenon the president told some 3500 students faculty and 
parents at conestoga valley high school in the heart of amish and 
mennonite farm country near lancaster 
when drugs come here to the conestoga valley thats proof the 
drug epidemic is a national problem bush said the rising 
problem here simply shows how vulnerable every american city and 
town is to the menace of drug abuse 
bush noted an acceleration of drug abuse in the past two years in 
the historically staid pennsylvania dutch region 
most americans want to see their towns restored to a time when 
drugs came from the local md where crack was something you 
jumped over to avoid bad luck the president said 
twentythree million americans used illegal drugs last year 
bush said countless thousands died the fact is that none of is 
immune to the problems drug abuse can cause 
weve learned a hard lesson unless we join together and fight 
it can happen here but if we do work as a team and as a community 
it wont he said 
dont hide yourself from the reality of drug abuse in our 
communities and hope for the best bush told his audience 
the good news is you are fighting back he said your 
community is too proud your traditions here too deeply rooted for 
an invader to threaten your safety and wellbeing without a fight 
he praised local programs that target for special attention 
highrisk youths in area elementary and high schools as doing 
something to stop drug problems before they begin 
but the president said the war on drugs will ultimately be 
won one day one battle at a time the battles each and every one 
of us wage to keep our families and communities free from drug 
abuse 
following the speech bush met with about a dozen leaders of the 
local amish community a quiet religious people who shun publicity 
and such modernday conveniences as televisions and telephones 
i salute you because as we look at a national drug problem we 
find communities like yours with strong religious faith and family 
values the drug problem seems to be nonexistent or hopefully 
nonexistent the president said 
this is an antinarcotics swing and maybe i could hear how 
your community staves off the problem he said 
during an informal chat that lasted nearly a halfhour amish 
leaders told bush they believed that teaching their young to have a 
strong religious faith and a sense of selfdenial helps keep drugs 
away from their communities but one amish man told of how his 
teenage son had once been offered marijuana while given a ride home 
from work 
another leader told bush he believed the drug problem had been 
kept away from his community because the young amish do not have 
access to television and radio and sexual things 
the amish leaders seated around the table carried no name tags 
and photographers were not permitted to take pictures of bushs 
meeting with the men 
the outing was his second drugrelated appearance away from 
washington dc he traveled to new york on march 10 telling drug 
enforcement administration agents the hunting season is over for 
copkilling drugrunners 
bush had planned to kick off his antidrug abuse crusade at the 
pennsylvania and delaware sites on march 7 but that was postponed 
because of a latewinter storm 
while bush seeks public support for his antidrug abuse effort 
bennett is considering a number of options ranging from imprisoning 
drug dealers on barges to evicting convicted dealers from public 
housing in the capital city an aide said tuesday 
bennett has said he may make the district of columbia a test case 
in the war on drugs by designating it the nations first 
highintensity drugtrafficking area

a man who grows vegetables inside some 
of the 10000 old tires stacked on his rural property claiming they 
would provide a shield against nuclear fallout has been ordered to 
move the tires elsewhere 
the josephine county planning commission decided monday that 
richard busks method of filling the tires with dirt and growing 
vegetables in them isnt normal farming practice 
busk said he will appeal he contends he will need his tires to 
grow food after a nuclear war or the collapse of the ozone layer 
which protects the planet from solar radiation 
tires are the home gardeners answer to nuclear fallout busk 
said 
he contended that after the fallout from a nuclear explosion had 
settled to earth a tire farmer would only have to remove the top 
tire and he would have uncontaminated soil to grow vegetables 
the stacks of tires would also allow farming after the collapse 
of the ozone layer by cooling the plants during sizzling days and 
keeping them warm during frigid nights busk argued 
im applying for my constitutional right not the privilege of 
continuing to garden in tires he said 
but government officials say busk needs a special permit to keep 
the tires on his fiveacre piece of land in rural illinois valley 
only about 10 percent to 15 percent of the tires he has collected 
since 1986 are producing a crop 
tires that arent removed should be filled with soil to make them 
less of a tire hazard and prevent mosquitoes from breeding in the 
water that collects in them said bradford price of the state 
department of environmental quality

us civil rights commission chairman william 
barclay allen said today he has no plans to resign despite talk 
that president bush wants to replace him with one of his political 
supporters 
allen said there was no reason for him to resign 
it is easy for the president to name a chairman from the 
sitting commissioner any time he wants said allen after 
testifying before a house appropriations subcommittee although 
there are no vacancies on the commission he said he expected bush 
could devise a way to create one if he wanted to 
allen said he has been trying to meet with bush since the 
election but has received no response from the president or anyone 
else at the white house 
the washington post reported today that bush has decided he wants 
arthur a fletcher a moderate republican and one of his early black 
political supporters to succeed allen as chairman an 
administration official insisting on anonymity said fletcher was a 
strong candidate to get the job 
allen who was appointed by president reagan in april 1987 is 
serving a term that does not expire until 1992 
the new york times quoting a white house aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the administration is in a quandary 
over how to proceed 
allen has been embroiled in controversy over his visit to the 
white mountain apache reservation in arizona on feb 7 to look into 
a custody dispute involving a 14yearold girl indian girl 
the girl had been adopted and taken off the reservation at birth 
her mother sued to have her returned and allen a psychologist and a 
television crew went to the reservation to interview the girl 
tribal authorities were outraged calling the incident an 
invasion of sovereignty 
during the subcommittee hearing today rep jim kolbe rariz 
asked allen why he went to the reservation 
allen said he was gathering information for the commissions 
study of whether the tribes and the bureau of indian affairs were 
protecting the civil rights of the indians 
he said the report which has been under study since 1985 should 
be released soon 
he said he tried to stop the psychologist from taking the girl 
off the reservation 
the civil rights commission has been the subject of mounting 
criticism in congress for various positions it adopted during the 
reagan administration including opposition to affirmative action 
programs major civil rights groups have denounced the panel since 
reagan appointees assumed control 
the post quoted an administration official anonymously as saying 
that bush is determined to make the commission respectable again 
fletcher who runs a consulting business in washington held 
political positions in both the ford and nixon administrations he 
also served with bush at the united nations in 1971 
fletcher told the post that he had spoken with administration 
officials about taking the civil rights commission post but had not 
spoken with the president about it

the old concrete barns and nondescript 
structures at the hollywood center studios hardly pass as 
architectural wonders but they have become embroiled in a battle 
between studio bosses and preservationists 
inside the hollow clay tile walls live the memories of comedians 
harold lloyd and lucille ball director francis ford coppola 
actress jean harlow and the comedy team burns and allen 
they are the memories hollywood preservation groups want to 
preserve in their fight to declare the buildings landmarks and 
prevent further destruction of the studio 
owners of hollywood center studios and other old lots however 
see the preservationists efforts as an ominous sign saying such 
moves to save tinseltowns past interfere with the entertainment 
business of today 
they preservationists deal in what i would call the indian 
burial ground syndrome said albert j tenzer vice president and 
chief financial officer of hollywood center studios you cant 
touch anything because the ghosts that surround and permeate the 
hallowed grounds are not to be disturbed

to silent screen comedian lloyd and was the site where howard hughes 
produced and directed hells angels giving ms harlow her first 
starring role

and harriet show and the burns and allen show george burns 
still has an office on the lot 
these are the industrial sites around which hollywood grew and 
developed said preservationist hillary gitelman executive 
director of hollywood heritage theyre really important to the 
world in terms of the myths that were created here and the cultural 
impact of those creations 
hollywood center studios has been denied a permit to demolish 
twostory buildings that the city itself found unsafe in the event

lucas confessed to killing the woman whose body was found oct 
31 1979 next to a highway culvert near austin and to other

since making the statements lucas has said he really only killed 
his mother in tecumseh mich in 1960 
in the opinion affirming the conviction judge wc davis wrote

silence lucas appears to have been determined to speak to the 
authorities desiring his attention

the commerce department reported wednesday that 
orders to factories for big ticket durable goods declined for 
the second straight month in february another sign the economy is 
losing steam 
orders fell 36 percent in february to a seasonally adjusted 
1237 billion after dropping 29 percent in january the first 
backtoback declines in three years and the steepest drops since a 
74 percent dive last july most analysts had been expecting a 
modest increase 
i think this is further evidence that the economy is indeed 
starting to slow down said economist david wyss of data resources 
inc in lexington mass 
the decline in orders coupled with other government reports 
showing slower economic activity last month suggests that the 
federal reserves tightening has done its job wyss said 
the central bank for a year has been tightening credit in an 
effort to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace and rein in 
inflation which has been on the rise in recent months 
earlier government reports on economic activity in february 
detailed persistent inflation but also recorded a drop in retail 
sales a decline in factory operating rates flat industrial 
production and a sharp drop in housing construction 
the reports we get from manufacturers are that high interest 
rates and a slowdown in export growth are causing their order 
picture to taper off said jerry jasinowski chief economist for 
the national association of manufacturers 
jasinowski said that while the economy is slowing somewhat 
theres still pretty solid growth out there 
while most analysts expect a welcome slowdown this year that 
would ease inflationary pressures some economists are afraid the 
feds fight against rising prices could stifle economic growth 
altogether 
as a result of the feds high interest rate policy and overly 
severe reductions in bank reserves there is danger that the economy 
will slide into a recession said economist lawrence a hunter of 
the us chamber of commerce 
wyss however said that while the nation is experiencing higher 
inflation and an earlier economic slowdown than expected i still 
think the odds favor getting through this without a recession 
orders for durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years were down in nearly all major industries last month with 
most of the decline blamed on an 85 percent drop in demand for 
transportation equipment mainly autos and aircraft 
excluding transportation orders in all other categories were 
down 17 percent last month after falling 04 percent in january 
the weakness occurred despite a 201 percent surge in defense 
orders a category subject to wide swings depending on when big 
contracts are signed defense orders had plunged 349 percent in 
january and risen 24 percent in december 
excluding defense all other orders were down 49 percent in 
february the biggest decline since a 57 percent drop in january 
1987 
weakness also was evident in an 89 percent decline in orders for 
nondefense capital goods considered a bellwether of industry 
investment plans the category had risen 22 percent in january and 
101 percent in december 
by industry orders for primary metals were down 33 percent last 
month with the steel industry accounting for most of the decline 
demand for nonelectrical machinery was down 23 percent while 
orders for electrical equipment rose 06 percent 
shipments of durable goods fell 25 percent to 1206 billion 
last month the biggest drop since a 29 percent decline in july 
1988

an air line pilots association leader today 
denied a fellow union officials story that a delta air lines 
captain balked at carrying frank lorenzo boss of strikecrippled 
eastern airlines on a flight 
john knudson a pilots union official had said today that a 
delta pilot refused to fly upon learning lorenzo was aboard his salt 
lake citytonew york flight tuesday night knudson said another 
pilot had to fly the plane 
but capt jim gray head of alpas delta division said that 
while the delta crew was initially concerned about flying lorenzo 
there was no incident as claimed by knudson 
the flight operated absolutely normally with the captain who 
was assigned to the flight taking the flight gray said it was 
an uneventful flight 
it is typical and required on all delta flightsto provide a 
security briefing to the crew in advance of the flight of any 
personalities on board they might be celebrities bomb threats 
from atoz anything that would be any operation abnormality 
gray said and in this case frank lorenzo had a ticket on the 
flight and the captain was not advised of it the crew was very 
uneasy about that 
but gray said the captain whom he did not identify was 
satisfied that security was adequate and the flight operated 
normally to new york 
mr lorenzo got off the flight thanked the captain for a very 
nice ride the captain said thank you very much and mr lorenzo was 
not aware that there was any kind of problem gray said 
an attempt to reach knudson about grays remarks resulted in a 
call instead from john mazor a spokesman for the parent union in 
washington who said knudson had based his account on sketchy and 
incomplete information 
aides to lorenzo and delta also denied knudsons account 
he was on that flight sitting there reading his newspaper 
said arthur kent a spokesman for lorenzos texas air corp which 
owns eastern there was no incident hes aware of 
kent said lorenzo was sitting alone in the firstclass section 
asked why lorenzo flew delta instead of texas air carrier 
continental airlines kent said because he needed to get to new 
york and that was the first available flight 
the spokesman declined to say why lorenzo was in salt lake city 
why he flew to new york or where he was staying 
lorenzo has been targeted by airline industry unions as the main 
reason for the severe problems at eastern which his company bought 
three years ago workers struck the airline march 4 and it filed for 
bankruptcycourt protection march 9

the public speeches over chinese legislators 
withdrew behind the scenes wednesday to begin the main task of their 
twoweek annual session studying the leaderships latest line 
they also had a chance away from the public eye to air their own 
suggestions for better government within the limits of what is 
politically acceptable 
most according to televised excerpts either praised premier li 
pengs report to the congress supported his austerity program or 
raised special interests such as a ban on liquor ads proposed by 
one northwestern delegate 
in guest houses all over beijing the same scene was repeated as 
the nearly 2800 delegates to the national peoples congress and 
2081 delegates to the chinese peoples political consultative 
conference gathered in groups of one to two dozen 
they sat in rows of softcushioned chairs pulled out pads and 
pencils sipped tea from lidded mugs and and dozed while their 
colleagues took turns giving rambling comments on lis report 
how can it be that the great chinese nation must drive foreign 
cars zhu jiqun a professor at the international education 
institute complained to about twodozen inattentive colleagues in a 
dining room of the fragrant hills hotel 
we dont need foreign cars we have our own shanghaimade 
santana zhu said in a call for trade protectionism he apparently 
was unaware the santana is assembled mostly of parts imported from 
west germany by a joint venture volkswagen factory in shanghai 
vice premier yao yilin also called for protectionism in his 
speech to the congress tuesday 
zhus group was made up of delegates to the consulative 
conference an advisory group that meets at the same time as the 
congress its meetings were open wednesday to foreign reporters who 
registered in advance 
both bodies meetings were conducted in small groups with 
delegates offering their views in monologues few of which led to 
discussions 
the consultative conference has no political power the national 
peoples congress technically must approve all laws but only in 
rare instances has the legislature forced significant change 
before adjourning april 4 the congress must approve lis report 
a foregone conclusion in the past only minor phrase changes have 
been made in response to delegate suggestions 
discussions were more lively last year as the government buoyed 
by an economic boom encouraged participants to speak their minds 
many complied with strings of complaints about prices poorquality 
education and other ills 
this year however the government is concerned that 36 percent 
inflation could trigger social unrest and it has stressed unity 
a euphemism for toeing the party line 
the education delegation to the consultative congress made only 
mild criticisms of the school system even though it is generally 
acknowledged to be in bad shape due to a lack of money 
as long as we strengthen control of the students everything 
will be fine said shen panwen a professor at nankai university 
in tianjin he also said college students need more ideological 
education 
one member of the conferences fine arts delegation began by 
asking what is fine art but 35 minutes later after touching 
on the need to protect cultural artifacts and his concerns over 
population growth liu bingsen ended up with a call for eugenics 
on a recent visit to his home village outside beijing liu said 
he encountered a retarded woman who had five children 
no matter what we cant kill her but we need a law to stop 
her from having children he said the group laughed

the united states today urged the plo in a 
4hour meeting to take practical steps to ease tension in the 
israelioccupied territories the head of the us delegation said 
after the meeting us ambassador robert h pelletreau said 
there was a new dynamic in the middle east of which this 
dialogue is a part 
he said the two sides discussed substantive issues relating to 
the peace process and talked about practical steps that can be 
taken in the occupied territories to reduce tension 
pelletreaus statement did not elaborate on the content of the 
talks and he did not answer questions from reporters 
yasser abedrabbo a member of the plo executive committee who 
headed the palestinian delegation said in a statement after the 
meeting that it was the israeli occupation and israeli repressive 
measures that caused tension in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
it is the responsibility of the united states to make every 
effort to stop this israeli terrorism against our people 
abedrabbo said 
before the meeting began a us embassy official who spoke to 
reporters on condition of anonymity said the united states was not 
asking the plo to stop the palestinian uprising 
we will not be asking for an end to the intifadeh uprising 
but for practical steps that can be taken to reduce the tension and 
reduce the suffering he said 
reports from israel said the plo had agreed to what was described 
as an ussponsored peace plan in which israel would negotiate an 
interim settlement with elected palestinians with the plo joining 
the talks only in the second stage 
there was no reference to such a plan in the statements from 
either side 
fifteen months of clashes between israeli troops and palestinians 
in the occupied gaza strip and west bank has left more than 400 
palestinians and 17 israelis dead with no sign of an end to the 
violence 
farouk kaddoumi head of the plos political department said in 
an interview that he agrees the violence should be brought to an 
end but said it should be done by putting the territories under 
un supervision 
quelling the intefadeh or asking us to stop the intefadeh is a 
taboo it should not be asked kaddoumi said 
israel says the palestine liberation organization is a terrorist 
group and refuses to negotiate with it about its demands for an 
independent state 
the united states refused to deal officially with the plo until 
december when plo chairman yasser arafats renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist 
secretary of state james a baker iii on tuesday ruled out us 
support for establishment of an independent palestinian state and 
urged the plo not to block palestinian arabs from negotiating a 
settlement with israel 
the plo wants an international peace conference involving all the 
parties directly concerned by the arabisraeli conflict and under 
the aegis of the five permanent members of the un security council 
the united states the soviet union china britain and france 
israel rejects such a conference washington does not seem as 
adamantly opposed to it as it once was

the sense of deja vu is palpable these days as 
the bush administration tries to fend off congressional complaints 
that american policy toward el salvador is playing into the hands of 
the most retrograde elements in that country 
in what has many of the earmarks of a rerun of what president 
reagan faced in the early 1980s some members of congress want to 
condition the salvador aid program on clear signs of progress toward 
peace and protection of human rights 
reagan survived the challenge largely because the first free and 
fair election in el salvador occurring in the spring of 1984 
produced as president a figure whom even the staunchest of reagans 
congressional critics could admire jose napoleon duarte 
when duarte spent a day on capitol hill in may 1984 extolling 
the virtues of his countrys newborn democracy 10 days before his 
inauguration opposition to salvadoran aid evaporated 
now however almost five years later and with duarte due to step 
down in 10 weeks the questions which once hovered over the salvador 
aid debate are being revived 
is the united states unwittingly prolonging a system that 
seemingly is unable to come to grips with such issues as war 
injustice poverty and repression or is the united states through 
its policies sparing el salvador a victory by the countrys leftist 
guerrillas 
in el salvador liberals are at pains to find any benefit 
accruing to the salvadoran people despite an unusually generous 
american aid program during this decade more than 35 billion in 
economic and military assistance by far the largest in the 
hemisphere 
el salvador has enjoyed a free ride from the united states with 
the american taxpayer footing the bill says sen tom harkin 
diowa author of a bill to slice the us military aid program in 
half unless certin conditions are met to limit corruption harkin 
also wants guarantees that the us economic aid program helps those 
in need 
harkin believes that permissive us policies have thwarted the 
goals of peace reform and democracy in el salvador 
what appears to have strengthened the hand of harkin and his 
allies is the election of the arena party candidate alfredo 
cristiani in sundays presidential election in el salvador for 
many in congress arena is synonymous with rightist death squads an 
allegation that cristiani angrily denies 
a glimpse of the debate that is likely to emerge in the coming 
weeks over el salvador was evident tuesday when secretary of state 
james a baker iii testified before a house foreign affairs 
subcommitee 
we ought to give this new government a chance to prove itself 
before we start condemning it in some sort of kneejerk fashion 
baker told the subcommittee 
but rep olympia snowe rmaine said she is concerned that 
things are not functioning in el salvador nearly as well as 
supporters of that countrys democratic system hoped they would 
voter turnout on sunday declined from past elections human 
rights abuses continue and the civil war still rages she said 
despite american generosity she said polls indicate that 
salvadorans regard their situation as much worse than it was 
before 
but when she complained that half of el salvadors municipalities 
have no mayors baker had a ready answer 
they dont have mayors because mayors are afraid theyll be 
murdered by the communist insurgency baker said with a rare 
display of irritation he rejected the notion he felt was implicit 
in snowes question that el salvador lacks mayors because the us 
aid program has been too generous

more than 1200 academy members approved only eight of a list of 
23 candidates presented by its leadership a new election must now 
be held in two weeks to fill the other 12 vacancies 
the vote yesterday was necessary sakharov told reporters at 
the gathering now we can choose 12 new people this was a result 
of a great grassroots movement of the scientific intelligentsia if 
they choose me to be a candidate and a deputy i will not refuse 
while sakharov is among the candidates for the new 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies from the academy of sciences yeltsin 
is running in a geographical district that encompasses all of moscow 
yeltsin is strongest in the struggle with bureaucracy and 
dishonesty in society said olga ulitova a former medical worker 
who has been a communist party member for 27 years 
he is the only one in 70 years of soviet power who did not take 
the privileges offered by his high position she added 
he struggles for the party for a clean party moscow worker 
valery reptov shouted to the crowd 
yeltsin ran moscow as its communist party chief until he was 
sacked in november 1987 for his criticism of the partys style of 
leadership and warning that a stalinlike cult of personality could 
develop around president mikhail s gorbachev 
he has remained popular with many muscovites and has become an 
antiestablishment symbol in his campaign against yevgeny brakov 
director of the giant zil factory that produces limousines and 
household appliances 
both as moscow party leader and in his campaign yeltsin has 
lashed out at special privileges that top party and government 
officials receive they include cars and chauffeurs and continuing 
access to special stores where they can buy hardtofind food and 
consumer goods at a time when the citys stores are emptier than 
they have been in years 
pulling out her redcovered party membership card mrs ulitova 
said she and many others were ready to turn them in if they believe 
yeltsin is cheated out of election 
yeltsin and his supporters accuse party officials of waging a 
campaign to discredit him that included formation of a commission by 
the partys policymaking central committee last week to review 
whether his views are at odds with party policies 
yeltsin did not appear at the rally which was quieter than a 
march sunday that ended with a rally on the same spot and drew 
criticism from police the crowd grew from several hundred to 
several thousand in 90 minutes but many people watched quietly from 
the edges and did not join in 
sakharov a nuclear physicist who also won the 1975 nobel peace 
prize for his human rights activities had criticized an election 
process that narrowed a list of 121 nominees to 23 for the 20 
academy of sciences seats as undemocratic 
he and other leading proponents of reform such as space scientist 
roald sagdeev and economist nikolai shmelev were eliminated 
their names were resubmitted wednesday by supporters but academy 
president gury marchuk said it would have to form a new electoral 
commission and have it approved by soviet officials before any 
action to fill the 12 slots could be taken

the elevation of newt gingrich to the house 
republican leadership wednesday gave the party a whip with partisan 
sting and sent a clear message to a new president who preaches 
bipartisanship and to gop house elders all too comfortable with 
minority status 
gingrich is nothing if not quotable with the georgia congressman 
in a leadership position the democratic majority can expect to feel 
more intense rhetorical heat 
but while gingrich might make for more interesting political 
warfare in the house chamber the impact of his new status on 
president bushs legislative goals is another question 
the president took office with an appeal for compromise over 
confrontation 
on the large issues facing the nation the president acknowledged 
that difficult choices were required and there were no easy 
solutions 
this is the age of the offered hand he told democratic 
congressional leaders in his inaugural address 
the new president decried a certain divisiveness he said 
we have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not 
each others ideas are challenged but each others motives 
it was the kind of message of good will that house republican 
leader robert michel of illinois could enthusiastically applaud 
but it also reflected an approach that would set gingrichs teeth 
on edge 
gingrich prefers the clenched fist to the offered hand and his 
election over a moderate supported by michel reflected a sense among 
many other republicans that change was needed 
house republicans were nearly evenly divided on the secret ballot 
to elect a successor to richard cheney of wyoming who has moved to 
the pentagon as secretary of defense 
after the 87 to 85 vote by which he defeated rep edward madigan 
of illinois gingrich appeared with michel and offered his hand to 
the minority leader who undoubtedly numbered among the republicans 
who voted against the georgia congressman 
i think you will find this to be a team effort said 
gingrich its not a conservative activist victory it is the 
entire repubican team 
if this election had been a test of bob michels leadership i 
wouldnt have gotten 40 votes gingrich added if bob michel 
stood up and said this is a test of my leadership a vote of 
confidence in me he would have a won and b i would have 
withdrawn 
but the fact was that gingrich represented a new approach 
he sought the office as a national republican in a body that 
reveres the saying all politics is local 
as the republican who led the attacks on democratic speaker jim 
wright gingrich stood apart from gop leaders who cherished their 
ability to work out compromises with the party that has controlled 
the house since gingrich was 11 years old 
but to gingrich and other increasingly vocal and frustrated 
younger republicans the michel approach was one of accepting a few 
crumbs from the democratic table an attitude reflecting acceptance 
of minority status 
we tend to say oh gee theyre in charge how can we be nice 
enough to them that theyll let us pretend were part of the game 
gingrich told reporters i represent the wing of the party that 
says fine well take up that challenge 
adding to the frustration of republicans was the lack of any 
progress toward improving their numbers in the house 
when ronald reagan took office in january 1981 to usher in an 
era in which republicans could talk confidently about a political 
realignment in their favor there were 192 republicans in the house 
the party that elected gingrich after eight years of republican 
control of the white house held 174 seats 
while bush was carrying 40 states in the 1988 presidential 
election democrats were picking up another three house seats and 99 
percent of incumbents seeking reelection were coasting to victory 
those results were enough to send republicans looking for a new 
approach

drinkers raised a glass wednesday to cheer the 
governments planned revolution of the beer industry saying it 
should bring cheaper prices and a wider selection of pubs and 
beverages 
but the brewing industry attacked the plans to reduce their 
control over pubs calling them a charter for chaos that would 
create megapubs and destroy the quintessentially english public 
house 
in what would be the biggest shakeup of the brewing industry 
since licensing laws were introduced in 1917 the government on 
tuesday announced plans to prevent brewers from owning more than 
2000 pubs each and end a complex monopoly situation 
that means britains six big brewers would have to sell off about 
22000 of the nations 82000 pubs perhaps within three years 
the biggest impact would be on bass plc britains largest 
brewer which owns more than 7000 pubs and on alliedlyons plc and 
whitbread plc which own well over 6000 pubs each their shares 
fell on londons stock exchange on the news 
the government also said brewers would have to allow their tenant 
pubs to sell at least one guest beer brewed by a rival company 
the measures would end britains 239yearold tied house 
system under which about 55 percent of the total number of pubs may 
only sell beers supplied by the breweries that own them 
tied pubs are either those public houses owned by breweries but 
rented to tenants or managed houses which are owned and operated 
by the brewers 
the pubs selloff which may be the largest ever divestment of 
assets ordered by the government reflects prime minister margaret 
thatchers drive to broaden consumer choice 
it is the second revolution to hit pubs in recent months last 
august they began staying open throughout the day ending a 73year 
tradition of closing for a few hours during the afternoon 
faced with competition from trendy wine bars and declining beer 
consumption pubs have been sprucing themselves up and are more 
likely to offer meals 
the latest measures result from a 2year inquiry by the 
monopolies and mergers commission trade secretary lord young said 
he was inclined to implement them in the near future after 
consulting with the european commission which also is investigating 
britains brewing industry 
the pub is a great british institution the changes will 
preserve the good features of the system he said 
young said the measures should provide a wider choice for 
consumers in the range of premises and drinks on sale this extra 
competition should benefit prices he said adding that beer 
prices had risen 15 percent between 1979 and 1987 after adjusting 
for inflation a pint of beer costs about 172 in london 
the big six which also include grand metropolitan plc guinness 
plc and elders ixl produce threequarters of all beer brewed in 
britain and control threequarters of the pubs 
john gillies a property surveyor socializing at the cittie of 
yorke pub in central london said wednesday im all in favor of 
it it will mean more free houses which means more competition 
youre going to have much nicer pubs in which to drink said 
john turner a property refurbisher today managers dont have 
the incentive to make them work we have lots of scruffy badly run 
pubs 
stephen cox spokesman for the campaign for real ale a consumer 
group said the breweries are screaming like stuck pigs because 
entrenched privileges are being tackled the proposals are 
excellent 
but the national licensed victuallers association which 
represents tenants is concerned that selling so many pubs in such a 
short time would depress their value 
estimates of the total value of the pubs to be sold range from 
34 billion to 12 billion 
some brewers might hold on to their pubs and sell off their 
brewing operations other companies might split themselves in 
separate brewing and retailing firms 
the brewers society the main industry group said 33000 
tenanted pubs would be at risk jobs would be lost breweries closed 
and the number of brands cut 
ben hanbury a spokesman for bass which would have to sell more 
than 5000 pubs said we dont see anything in the report to 
indicate lower prices and wider choice

during the next month wyomings republicans 
and democrats will wage a frenzied expensive battle to capture the 
states lone us house seat 
sixterm rep dick cheney gave up the seat last week when he was 
confirmed as defense secretary the vacancy drew a pack of 
republican contenders and gave democrats their second opportunity in 
less than five months to break the gop monopoly in wyomings 
threemember congressional delegation 
democrats estimated each party would spend 400000 over the next 
35 days and altogether the candidates would spend more than 20000 
per day 
this is a very important election for us and for wyoming 
said muffy moore state democratic party chairman we should have 
somebody in the majority party in congress if were going to be 
adequately represented 
not since 1978 when rep teno roncalio gave way to cheney has a 
democrat from wyoming served in the house or senate 
the jockeying for the parties nominations ends this week as the 
republican central committee meets thursday in casper to choose a 
nominee from the 10 candidates on saturday the democratic central 
committee will select its nominee with state sen john vinich the 
frontrunner because of his strong race against us sen malcolm 
wallop last fall 
wallop edged vinich by some 1300 votes in winning a third term 
and democrats believe the recognition the state senator gained in 
the bitter campaign will help him in the special election april 26 
republican party state chairman mark hughes who in the past has 
angered democrats with caustic remarks about gov mike sullivan and 
other top democrats already has renewed last years attacks on 
vinichs voting record as too liberal 
we dont want to lose the gains the republican party has made 
in congress over the last 10 or 15 years he said we want to 
continue with a conservative representative who will be very 
difficult to deal with when it comes to spending more money than we 
have 
we dont want to have the george bush team and the ronald 
reagan mandates undermined by sending back a democratic senator who 
is known for liberal spending policies 
hughes plays down vinichs name recognition 
i think there are some people who believe that vinich has the 
upper hand initially he agreed but we have 10 or 11 good 
candidates all of whom i believe the republican party can support 
where they democrats may apparently only have one because all the 
others have dropped out 
seen as leaders in the race for the gop nomination are state rep 
craig thomas of casper former state republican party chairman tom 
sansonetti of gillette and former state sen dave nicholas of 
laramie 
while vinich faired better than expected against wallop 
democrats dont expect him to take the special election by storm 
we have to look at the heavy republican registration and 
realize we have a big fight on our hands said moore it does 
certainly help that vinich is as wellknown and respected as he 
is but i expect it to be a very tough race theyve got more 
registered voters theyve got a great deal more money

four activists who escaped to 
the west german embassy emerged wednesday after police guaranteed 
their freedom 
they demanded the release of all other detainees including one 
reported near death because of a 33day hunger strike 
we emerge feeling victorious said ephraim nkoe one of the 
four blacks who fled to the embassy monday from johannesburgs 
hillbrow hospital where they had been admitted after joining other 
detainees in a widespread hunger strike 
nkoe said the four just marched out of the hospital in 
pajamas while their guards were not looking and took a taxi to the 
embassy in pretoria the men pressed the buzzer at the embassys 
locked gate nkoe said and were allowed in after saying they had a 
message for one of the diplomats 
the men left the embassy and returned to johannesburg where they 
embraced relatives before addressing a news conference 
they called for the release of the estimated 300 activists still 
detained without charge and issued a special appeal on behalf of 
sandile thusi hospitalized in critical condition in durban after 
fasting for 33 days nkoe said law and order minister adriaan vlok 
sent a police general to durban to determine if thusi 26 should be 
released 
the four escapees had been held for periods of 10 months to 23 
months in addition to nkoe 28 they are job sithole 21 mpho 
lekgoro 24 and clive radebe 28 all leaders of youth groups 
affiliated to the banned united democratic front antiapartheid 
coalition 
many detainees freed since the hunger strike began in january 
have been placed under nighttime house arrest and barred from 
involvement in antiapartheid groups the law and order ministry 
imposed no restrictions on the four escapees and said release orders 
were being prepared for three of them at the time of their getaway 
the detainees said this claim was difficult to believe their 
skepticism was shared by business day a johannesburg newspaper 
which said vlok was trying to conceal both the shame of detention 
without trial and the embarrassment of release without notice 
more than 600 detainees have staged hunger strikes for varying 
periods since january demanding to be released or put on trial the 
government says it has authorized the release of 580 detainees since 
midfebruary but human rights groups say at least 300 people remain 
in detention including more than 60 hunger strikers 
the arbitrary manner in which vlok decides on the fate of 
detainees gives us the impression that he does not regard us as 
human beings but as numbers the escapees said 
the largest group of detainees about 80 is still held at st 
albans prison in port elizabeth lawyers say this group includes 
many prominent activists held without charge since 1986 who wont 
be released because the government is considering a treason case 
against them 
the rev frank chikane generalsecretary of the south african 
council of churches visited 15 of the st albans detainees 
wednesday he warned of a looming crisis at the prison where 
the detainees have suspended the hunger strike while vlok considered 
their status 
the governments handling of the escape was similar to its 
response last year when three united democrat front leaders escaped 
detention at a hospital and took refuge at the us consulate in 
johannesburg 
seeking to minimize publicity about the incident the government 
promptly declared the men were free after more than five weeks the 
men left the consulate and have resumed active roles in the 
antiapartheid movement

this depressed mississippi river town 
is a chamber of commerce nightmare with overflowing sewers empty 
coffers and an ongoing feud between the mayor and the governor 
but it has one thing that works the lincoln tigers a high 
school basketball team that made illinois sports history on saturday 
by winning its third consecutive state championship 
even the tigers have had their problems the uniforms are 
discolored the coach digs into his wallet to keep his players fed 
the basketballs dont have the bounce they once did and no one can 
afford to replace them 
i know we dont have much said senior center sharif ford 
but were winning the only thing we need is a basketball and a 
goal 
we love the city he said i guess we try to put our city 
on the map by winning 
what usually puts the city of 55000 people on the map is a long 
list of misfortunes 
located across the mississippi river from st louis 286 miles 
southwest of chicago east st louis is struggling to stay in 
business the city regularly misses payrolls and leaking sewers 
have sent raw sewage into streets a school cafeteria and the 
grounds surrounding a housing project 
this week gov james r thompson blamed the citys problems on 
mayor carl e officer and said east st louis would not get a state 
bailout unless voters boot officer from city hall one city official 
pledges to go to war to keep the governor from meddling in local 
affairs 
still the tigers win 
the exposure is definitely good for the community coach 
bennie lewis said of the third championship youre always hearing 
bad things about east st louis and thats one reason teams dont 
want to play here 
if you go to east st louis they say youll get killed 
lewis said this will show that its good here 
the school district which has debts of more than 10 million and 
is considering the furlough of more than 600 employees provides 
little financial support for the lincoln basketball team 
lewis took 200 from his own pocket to help feed his players in 
champaign site of the state basketball finals 
you cant just give a guy a sandwich and expect him to play 
hard said lewis the first illinois coach to win four class aa 
state titles youve got to feed them 
vincent jacksons shot at the buzzer gave the tigers a 5957 
tripleovertime victory over peoria central on sunday the school 
welcomed the state champs with a rally in the gym 
no one from the mayors office showed up to congratulate the 
tigers but more and more townspeople are taking notice of the 
teams success 
i think its an inspiration to the young children said lola 
griffin who lives in one of the citys housing projects down the 
road from lincoln high even though its a struggling town you 
hope for a better tomorrow 
cuonzo martin who scored 21 points in the championship game 
says the tigers are celebrities 
everybody wants to talk to you everybody wants you to come eat 
dinner at their house he said its an honor

president roh taewoo on wednesday 
ordered a crackdown on violent radical protests and police were 
told to use guns to defend themselves according to news reports 
roh directed senior security officials to act against leftist 
forces trying to overthrow the government through revolution the 
south korean news agency yonhap quoted presidential spokesman lee 
soojung as saying 
yonhap said the government ordered police to take up arms and 
invoke the right of selfdefense against firebomb attacks on their 
facilities 
the actions came two days after roh announced he was postponing 
indefinitely a national referendum he had promised as a midterm 
appraisal of his government 
on wednesday about 300 students with firebombs and rocks battled 
riot police at sogang university in seoul shouting down with roh 
taewoo the fighting lasted about an hour and there were no 
immediate reports of injuries or arrests 
major opposition parties denounced the new policy of allowing 
police to carry guns we are shocked and cannot but express 
anger said a statement by the opposition party led by kim 
youngsam 
police normally use only tear gas to defend themselves against 
violent acts such as firebombings 
national police directorgeneral jo jongsuk cautioned officers 
to use weapons prudently and aim at ankles and other nonvital parts 
of the body newspaper accounts said 
police gave no figures but said scores of officers have been 
injured by firebomb attacks so far this year 
in response to the news reports police would only say that 
stations will be armed with m16 rifles instead of carbines and 
that officers will be allowed to carry guns on patrol 
jo warned of intensified protests by dissidents and radical 
students who have vowed to fight on to oust the government a police 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
roh announced monday in a nationally televised speech that he was 
postponing indefinitely the referendum he promised in the 1987 
election campaign he accused leftist forces of trying to use the 
referendum which had been expected in april to organize violent 
protests to overthrow the government 
it was not clear if roh was backing away from the referendum 
because of concern over potential unrest or because he feared the 
government could not win the vote and might be forced into a new 
election 
dissidents charged roh wants to delay the referendum because he 
is unpopular 
the main opposition parties accepted rohs decision top 
opposition leader kim daejung had urged roh to avoid political 
unrest by holding the referendum after addressing corruption and 
other abuses left over from rohs authoritarian predecessor chun 
doohwan

a dissident said wednesday the recent government 
criticism of calls for political change in china was filled with 
emptiness and falsifications 
essayist ren wanding also accused the communist party of 
manipulating the courts and media in its attempt to crush the 
fledgling prodemocracy movement 
ren who was jailed in 197983 after helping edit an underground 
prodemocracy magazine has declared 1989 a memorial year for fellow 
dissidents who remain in jail the essay he read wednesday was the 
10th written for the memorial 
last week chinas official xinhua news agency condemned recent 
petitions for the release of political prisoners saying they 
interfered with chinas independent judiciary and invited foreign 
pressure on china 
since january more than 100 chinese intellectuals have signed 
four open letters calling for an amnesty and greater political 
freedom chinese have generally learned of the letters through 
western radio broadcasts 
ren read the essay in a cramped office where he works as an 
accountant 
i say chinas judiciary is run by the communist party for one 
all sentences handed down in political crimes must go through the 
communist party ren said so how can you say the judiciary is 
independent 
ren said that prodemocracy intellectuals do not believe in using 
foreigners to interfere in chinas internal affairs 
we are really the ones who fight that tendency the strongest 
he said 
and even china interferes in the internal affairs of other 
countries he said china has been interfering in the internal 
affairs of cambodia for years 
china was a strong supporter of the khmer rouge regime in 
cambodia from 197579 when it was overthrown by vietnamese invasion

amerasian children who are stricken with malaria parasitic 
infections and hepatitis

tetanus vaccinations to 41 amerasians in ho chi minh city in 
southern vietnam

up a government proposal that he be a visiting professor at the 
citys health workers training center 
ho chi minh city was called saigon when it was the capital of 
usbacked south vietnam which fell to communist forces in april

organization dedicated to helping homeless amerasians in vietnam and 
speeding their resettlement in the united states

open a second halfway house for the amerasians rogers a honolulu 
businessman and vietnam war veteran opened the first halfway house 
earlier this year 
mitchell who has worked with vietnamese and cambodian refugees 
said he wanted to help the amerasians because he believed the united 
states had abandoned them 
people are sneaking around looking for prisoners of war but 
the real pows are right in front of peoples noses mitchell said 
in an interview in bangkok we took our tanks our planes and our 
people out of vietnam but we left behind our amerasians

the navy said wednesday it hoped to 
find and correct the cause of a trident 2 missile explosion in time 
to fire the next missile in april and complete a series of submarine 
tests by years end 
the navys goal is to have the longrange missile operational by 
december that goal could be jeopardized if the problem is not found 
quickly but a navy statement said it would be premature to suggest 
the missile would not be ready for deployment then 
we dont know if there will be a setback or how much of a one 
until we know the cause of tuesdays failure and how much corrective 
action has to be taken said lt jim wood a navy spokesman 
right now our plan is to launch eight more starting in 
april he said our plan is to have the system operational in 
december 1989 
the first submarine launch of the navys newest and most powerful 
weapon ended in fiery failure shortly after one of the 44foot 
missiles vaulted out of tube in the deck of the submerged uss 
tennessee and shot to the surface the first stage ignited and the 
projectile immediately spun like a burning pinwheel and exploded 
four seconds after launch about 100 feet above the atlantic ocean 
a navy statement said an unknown malfunction caused the unarmed 
237 million missile to veer off course and selfdestruct it said 
no damage was done to the submarine or nearby support ships 
divers recovered the nose section and other parts wreckage that 
could help in the investigation of what went wrong authorities said 
wood said investigators also were analyzing the four seconds of 
radioed flight data and videotapes of the explosion but no 
results have come out of the review yet we have no firm ideas 
navy officials at the pentagon who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the failure appeared to involve a malfunction in the 
firststage rocket motor 
but we have no idea at this point just what went wrong said 
one official it will take a while to sort through the data 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon 
that is the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent it can 
deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 
6000 miles away 
the tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry 
24 of the deadly missiles 
the navy said it was disappointed with the failure but added 
it is through this type of developmental test program that you 
iron out problems 
the trident 2s predecessor the trident 1 experienced similar 
test failures but still was deployed on schedule the navy said 
the navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its 
undersea predecessors polaris poseidon and trident 1 and can 
match the targeting ability of landbased missiles even though it is 
launched from a submerged moving submarine 
tuesdays launch from the tennessee was preceded by what the navy 
called a highly successful series of test firings from a land launch 
pad at cape canaveral dating to january 1987

pope john paul ii said wednesday his fourday 
meeting with us bishops at the vatican this month offered 
valuable points of reference for confronting the challenges 
facing the american church 
in a letter to the bishops released by the vatican john paul 
said the march 811 meeting was marked by profound collegiality 
the encounter provided an occasion for a most fruitful 
reflection and discussion on important aspects of the churchs 
evangelizing role in your country which will offer valuable points 
of reference for your future ministry the letter said 
rather than a list of conclusions you who were present will 
convey to those whom you represented an increased awareness of the 
challenges which call the church in the united states to proclaim 
ever more effectively the mystery of christ 
while yours is a culture with many positive values it is at 
the same time like everything human marked by elements which need 
to be purified and uplifted by the saving message of the gospel 
the pope noted the vatican discussions often centered on the role 
of priests adding 
bishops have a special ministry to priests to encourage and 
support them justice and charity require that wise and careful 
attention be given to all aspects of their formation life and 
ministry 
the pope had called the extraordinary meeting to discuss how 
bishops can spread roman catholic teaching in an american society 
strongly influenced by such secular trends as divorce sexual 
promiscuity and materialism

a defense attorney has started a petition drive in 
support of a state district judge who faces a hearing on derogatory 
comments about two homosexual murder victims 
about 50 lawyers who have practiced before judge jack hampton 
signed the petitions along with about 30 laymen attorney jim moore 
said tuesday hampton faces a state commission on judicial conduct 
hearing that could cost him his job 
we just want to let the commission know that they have heard 
from a few of his detractors now theyre going to hear from a 
whole lot of his supporters said moore 
last month the commission announced it was pursuing formal 
charges against hampton after receiving almost 2000 complaints on 
comments the judge made after sentencing the killer of the two 
homosexuals 
a special prosecutor will determine whether hampton violated the 
state code of judicial conduct 
hampton acknowledged in december that he rejected a life sentence 
for richard lee bednarski because in part he believed the youths 
victims were queers cruising the streets picking up teenage 
boys and therefore asking for trouble 
moore said he started circulating the petitions last week to show 
the commission hampton has a lot more support i think than 
opponents

a prosecutor said wednesday he was 
considering genetic testing to end lingering doubts about the death 
of josef mengele the nazi concentration camp angel of death 
mengele held responsible for the killings of more than 400000 
people reportedly drowned in a swimming accident in brazil in 1979 
most of his victims at the auschwitz death camp were jews 
an international panel of forensic experts had concluded 
mengeles death had been demonstrated with reasonable scientific 
certainty but doubts have remained 
frankfurt prosecutor hanseberhard klein who is in charge of 
west germanys investigation of the case was to have met this week 
with representatives from israel and the united states to discuss 
the doubts and the possible further testing 
klein said that personal reasons prevented the frankfurt 
meeting this week with menachem russek israels chief nazi war 
crimes investigator and neal sher head of the us justice 
departments office of special investigations he did not elaboarate 
klein said the meeting is still expected to take place 
we are looking into the possibility of genetic testing of the 
remains klein said the remains alleged to be mengeles were 
exhumed in brazil in 1985 
but we still dont know if that is possible klein said in a 
telephone interview from his office the remains were lying in the 
ground for six years thats why were asking experts 
the testing involves comparing the genetic composition of the 
remains with that of the stillliving family members klein said 
he did not say whether family members had been contacted 
klein said that west german experts had parts of the corpses 
teeth but we dont know whether that will be sufficient for the 
testing 
the rest of the remains are still in brazil he said klein did 
not say when the tests would take place 
as long as there are doubts we cant simply look the other 
way said klein who has been leading the inquirye into the 
mengele case since 1974 
asked whether he believes that mengele is dead klein responded 
i believe so 
for decades after world war ii mengele was one of the most 
notorious nazis at large the physician received the nickname of 
angel of death for the slayings and the inhuman medical 
experiments on inmates at the camp in nazioccupied poland 
an international forensic team concluded with reasonable 
scientific certainty the skeleton removed in june 1985 from a 
grave near sao paulo brazil belonged to mengele 
the team relied primarily on dental records to reach its 
conclusion that mengele was dead associates of the nazi doctor said 
he drowned while swimming in 1979 at age 68 
in 1987 israeli legislator dov shilansky claimed the body was 
not of mengele in fridays issue of the jewish week a us 
publication an advertisement by jewish holocaust survivors said 
shers investigation into mengeles death was a disappointment 
klein has said previously he had no reason to doubt the report of 
international experts

and law will visit mental hospitals prisons and a correctional 
labor colony the official news agency said 
we stated publicly on a number of occaions that we have noted 
many positive developments in the soviet union said ian martin 
secretary general of amnesty international and the leader of the 
delegation leader but he added there are still matters of 
concern to us 
we want very much to discuss areas of international cooperation 
for the protection of human rights to have the opportunity of 
learning more about discussions of legal changes currently under way 
in the soviet union and to raise matters that have been of concern 
to our delegation he said 
the question of soviet soldiers taken prisoner in afghanistan was 
not on the agenda for discussion because pows were essentially a 
matter for the red cross martin said 
if we had information about what kind of treatment with 
relation to soviet prisoners of war we would certainly raise the 
issue he said so far we have not had that sort of information 
that would enable us to take action

house speaker jim wright wasnt on rep newt 
gingrichs thankyou list after the georgia conservative won 
election wednesday as house minority whip but he might well have 
been 
gingrich a 45yearold former college history professor was 
widely viewed as little more than an articulate gadfly with a 
penchant for publicity and a thirst for confrontation until he 
waltzed into the house ethics committee last may and filed a formal 
complaint against wright 
that act not only touched off an eightmonth investigation of the 
powerful texas democrat it also touched a nerve among many house 
republicans who were chafing under wrights rule and eager for a new 
direction 
rep lynn martin rill who supported rep ed madigan rill 
in the whip race said gingrichs courage in stepping out alone 
to challenge wright helped transform him in the eyes of his gop 
colleagues 
that was a dangerous thing most people wouldnt do martin 
said 
filing the complaint against wright which is still before the 
ethics committee was a natural evolution for gingrich who has 
spent most of his 10year career in the house bashing democrats and 
crusading against members with ethics problems 
as a freshman in 1979 gingrich led a battle on the house floor 
to expel rep charles diggs dmich after his conviction on fraud 
charges that campaign while unsuccessful brought the first house 
vote on expulsion of a member in half a century 
gingrich early on built a following among younger and more 
conservative members of the house gop caucus that group which 
became known as the conservative opportunity society in turn 
built a following around the country through their special order 
speeches on the house floor 
those speeches came after the house had completed its business 
each day and usually were delivered to an empty chamber but they 
were televised live across the country by the cspan cable network 
and they gave gingrich a vehicle to wage verbal war against the 
democratic welfare state 
his cspan lectures so angered thenhouse speaker thomas p 
oneill in 1984 that oneill lashed out at gingrich on the house 
floor that personal attack resulted in oneill being reprimanded by 
the house for improper conduct 
within months gingrich was at the democratic national convention 
in san francisco staging his own press show to rail against the 
whole cycle of reactionary liberalism 
after oneill retired and wright was elected speaker in 1987 
gingrich set up shop as a oneman ethics committee for more than a 
year in press conferences and special order floor speeches he 
railed against wright and some two dozen other democrats that he 
said deserved to be investigated by the house ethics committee 
during that campaign gingrichs own republican colleague from 
georgia thenrep pat swindall came under fire when it was 
disclosed that he had negotiated for a home loan with an undercover 
federal agent posing as a money launderer for drug dealers and 
underworld figures 
gingrich insists he told swindall he would file an ethics 
complaint against him if swindall did not request an investigation 
himself and swindall who was later indicted on perjury charges 
did make such a request 
but while swindall was under investigation he was elected with 
gingrichs support as chairman of the georgia delegation to the 
republican national convention 
gingrich who maintained throughout his campaign against wright 
and other house democrats that ethics was a bipartisan issue said 
there was nothing inconsistent in his support for swindall because 
unlike wright swindall had requested the ethics investigation 
despite his long record of partisanship gingrich said wednesday 
he doesnt expect any problems in working with the democratic 
leadership in the house as the no 2 gop leader but he predicted 
that house republicans will be more aggressive in defending their 
rights under his leadership 
when democrats give us a very fair rule im going to be very 
bipartisan he said when democrats try to run over us im 
going to stand in the way

a felon who blamed his life of crime on 
brain damage was put to death early wednesday for a 1978 
abductionslaying in which he bashed in the head of a man with the 
butt of a shotgun 
leon king 44 showed little reaction as he received lethal 
injection for the april 10 1978 slaying of michael clayton 
underwood 26 
i would like to tell mr richard i appreciate all he has done 
for me he said to richard wall one of five friends he was 
allowed to invite to witness his execution i love you all god 
bless 
he closed his eyes heaved a sigh as the drugs began to take hold 
and then stopped breathing 
he was declared dead at 1227 am 10 minutes after the lethal 
dose began to flow into his arm through a vein just above a tattoo 
of what appeared to be a naked woman 
if anyone deserves the death penalty its him said doug 
shaver an assistant district attorney who handled kings case 
shaver now a houston judge said king never expressed remorse 
for the slaying 
underwoods family declined to talk about the execution 
we are apprised always of what is going on his mother mrs 
cj underwood of houston said but we really do not have any 
desire to make any comment i dont think it would serve any 
purpose 
king on tuesday lost lastminute appeals before a federal judge 
in houston an appeals court in new orleans and the us supreme 
court his attorneys had contended that kings criminal activity 
stemmed from organic brain damage 
attorney general jim mattox said king an 11thgrade dropout who 
worked as a bricklayer admitted to at least 30 arrests for crimes 
including burglary forgery and drug possession 
he acknowledged fathering at least eight illegitimate children 
mattox said 
king was the third person executed this year and the 107th since 
the supreme court restored the death penalty in 1976 he was the 
30th inmate to be put to death in texas which has executed more 
people than any other state 
court records showed underwood and his 19yearold girlfriend 
were abducted at gunpoint from a houston nightclub and taken to a 
remote area where they were robbed of 1150 underwood was beaten 
to death and the woman was raped and sodomized repeatedly 
king and an accomplice allen ray carter were identified by the 
woman who survived the fivehour ordeal 
this was a particularly brutal murder one that was totally 
senseless to an unarmed and defenseless individual said mattox 
who witnessed the execution 
carter who could not get the death penalty because he was only 
16 at the time of the crime is serving a life prison term

the easter egg hunt had turned into such 
a scramble that smaller children were left with bumps on their heads 
and empty baskets 
so the city canceled the competition this year and replaced it 
with a jelly bean counting contest 
parents had complained in recent years that with 2000 to 3000 
kids scurrying after hidden eggs the smaller children garnered 
nothing but bruises and tears 
parents would lose sight of their kids and go in after them 
said keith mensing of the park department last year we had a lot 
of complaints and letters to the editor from people upset about it 
mensing said that since easter came early this year organizers 
had another reason to take activities inside rather than rely on 
good weather 
the egg hunt is being replaced with saturdays easter

wisconsin electors will vote april 4 on a tax 
measure so turgidly worded that not even linguistics specialists can 
figure out what it means 
the ballot will read 
shall section 1 of article viii of the constitution be revised 
and shall an additional provision be created in that section to 
allow the state of wisconsin to provide by law property tax relief 
or sales tax relief or both to the citizens of the state subject 
to reasonable classification and progressive effect on the tax 
system by means of credits or refunds for taxes due under property 
or sales taxes in this state to be credited against or refunded 
from taxes imposed by this state on income privileges and 
occupations 
strikingly incomprehensible university of chicago professor 
john goldsmith said tuesday after reviewing the question 
the federal tax forms were a model of clarity compared to 
this said michael noonan a linguist at the university of 
wisconsinmilwaukee 
but marquette university english professor michael a mikolajczak 
said someone with a solid high school education should be able to 
handle it 
approval of the measure would allow the legislature to enact laws 
providing tax breaks for middleincome residents analysts say 
adding the democratic plan would cost the state an estimated 370 
million in tax revenue this year

a man whose daughter was raped in 1984 
was named by a convicted rapist in an appeals court brief as one of 
two attackers who castrated him as he awaited trial 
the father walter stevie stevens said wednesday the 
accusation was totally ridiculous it was contained in a 71page 
brief filed this week with the 8th us circuit court of appeals at 
st louis 
on march 7 1985 before wayne dumonds trial two masked men 
entered his home bound him and then castrated him the men never 
have been caught 
dumond identifed stevens the former st francis county coroner 
after seeing him in a television interview in january the brief 
said during the interview stevens denied involvement in the 
castration 
when he saw stevens on tv that was the first time he had ever 
seen stevens talk or move said dumonds attorney john wesley 
hall jr he wrote out an affidavit to authorities naming stevens 
as one of the men who castrated him 
dumond had previously identified forrest city police officer 
stacy dye as one of the assailants after seeing dye during a may 
1988 hearing at forrest city dye also has denied the allegations 
in asking the 8th circuit to grant a new trial hall raised the 
issues of ineffective assistance of counsel in part because 
dumonds trial attorney entered into a contract with dumond for 
publication rights to his story and new genetic evidence that hall 
says shows dumond could not have committed the rape

several black legislators refused dinner at 
the governors mansion after gov ray mabus vetoed funding bills for 
charity hospitals 
i will not meet with the governor for dinner it would be a 
hypocritical act to look like i was pleased with him said rep 
aaron henry of clarksdale the charity hospitals should be 
expanded rather than retrenched 
i cant dine in the mansion after he vetoes the bill said 
rep barney schoby of natchez mabus decision to veto the bill for

tuesday night dinner about half the members attended said rep 
hillman frazier of jackson a caucus member who dined with the 
governor some who didnt attend had other engagements frazier said 
i accepted the invitation to go the governors veto has no 
bearing on it said frazier a black caucus member who supported 
mabus stand on charity hospitals theres more than one issue 
this session charity hospitals are not the only issue although it 
was very emotional

states have no constitutional duty to provide 
free lawyers for death row inmates who lose an initial round of 
appeals a virginia prosecutor told the supreme court on wednesday 
the right of access to the courts in postconviction 
proceedings does not include the right to counsel assistant 
virginia attorney general robert q harris contended 
he urged the justices to overturn a 4th us circuit court of 
appeals decision requiring the state to provide lawyers at taxpayer 
expense in socalled habeas corpus proceedings in state courts 
like other states virginia provides prison law libraries and 
assigns parttime lawyers to help all inmates prepare their 
secondround or collateral appeals in some cases volunteer 
lawyers are available 
the virginia system in place is enough harris said 
when justice harry a blackmun inquired whether states should be 
required to provide even more legal help for death row inmates 
harris said no 
but hasnt this court said many times that death is 
different blackmun asked harris said no special treatment of 
capital cases is constitutionally required in collateral appeals 
richmond lawyer gerald zerkin representing a number of virginia 
death row inmates disagreed he urged the justices to uphold the 
4th circuit courts ruling 
a decision is expected by july 
although state lawyers had argued in written briefs that the 
appeals court ruling could lead to interminable delays in carrying 
out executions justice john paul stevens got harris to concede that 
automatically appointing legal help could speed up the appellate 
process 
the american bar association and the american civil liberties 
union supported the virginia death row inmates in submitted 
friendofthecourt briefs 
twenty states joined in similar briefs supporting virginia those 
states are florida georgia mississippi north carolina missouri 
south dakota wyoming delaware california pennsylvania new 
mexico indiana kentucky new hampshire nevada utah south 
carolina oregon maryland and idaho 
the case is murray vs giarrantano 88411

the state department warned the romanian 
government on wednesday of serious consequences if it takes 
action against six retired communist officials whove criticized 
president nicolae ceausescus regime 
the six signed a letter that demanded improved human rights 
policies and an immediate halt to food exports from the 
shortageplagued country the letter reportedly sent in january 
marked the first time senior communists banded together to protest 
the tough approach of ceausescu whos been in charge since 1965 
earlier this month the son of one of the signators was arrested 
and charged with espionage apparently in connection with the 
protest 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the us 
government was concerned about the prospect of repressive measures 
against distinguished romanians or their families who have 
exercised their right of free speech in an open letter to the regime 
in bucharest 
the spokesman noted that 12nation european community has 
expressed concern about the matter 
infringements of free speech would constitute a violation of 
romanias human rights commitments including those of the helsinki 
final act and the vienna concluding document which romania has 
accepted redman said adding romanias failure to uphold such 
commitments would be an affront to the international community 
in the letter the former officials attacked romanias isolation 
in europe and ceausescus plans to destroy up to 7000 of the 
countrys 13000 villages in a resettlement campaign 
the letter also condemned a late 1970s decree that forbids 
romanians to speak to foreigners and denounced alleged systematic 
violations of private mail and telephone communications 
redman said us officials in bucharest have been instructed to 
make clear to the romanian government that we would regard any 
threat to the human rights of the people concerned as a violation of 
romanias international commitments and it would have serious 
consequences for us relations with romania 
asked to detail what type of actions the us government might 
take redman declined to say adding only i can only assure you 
that were watching the situation closely and that we will act 
accordingly 
the son of one of the protesting retirees mircea raceanu was 
accused of engaging in steady treasonable action since 1974 
according to an announcement made last week by the romanian general 
prosecutors office and reported in the state news agency agerpres 
raceanu who reportedly was arrested in january served in 
washington during the 1970s and most recently was deputy head of the 
foreign ministrys us desk in bucharest

the army said wednesday it had narrowed to four 
the number of bases under consideration to become the home to an 
expanded infantry training range 
the service in a brief statement said the four finalists 
included fort stewart ga fort chaffee ark fort mccoy wis 
and fort lewis wash 
the army disclosed the four in announcing it would soon launch an 
environmental impact study for expansion of what it calls the joint 
readiness training center 
the army currently operates the jrtc at fort chaffee but 
considers that facility too small for modernday infantry training 
fort chaffee is a finalist because the army wants to explore the 
possibility of expanding the existing range there said lt col 
dick bridges an army spokesman 
no matter which of the four is ultimately selected land use 
would include at a minimum about 46000 acres administered by the 
department of defense the army said 
the proposal will involve the stationing of approximately 
2000 permanently assigned personnel and training support to about 
35000 rotating unit personnel the service continued 
the jrtc will provide an area suitable for joint training 
exercises during which light infantry air assault airborne 
ranger special operations forces air force military airlift and 
air force tactical air train to fight against an opposing force 
the expansion is designed to provide a larger facility to 
compliment its national training center at fort irwin calif the 
national training center located in the mojave desert is used by 
the army to train its heavy tank and armor forces 
the jrtc in contrast is used to train light infantry 
forces the current jrtc at fort chaffee can handle only about one 
battalion at a time or about 800 to 1000 soldiers 
a pentagon spokesman said that an initial site selection 
screening process that included criteria for terrain ability of 
us air force operations to provide air support and environmental 
considerations was applied to a list of 1450 candidate sites as a 
result the following four alternatives will be considered 
the army said it would announce the schedules for public hearings 
at a later date a draft environmental impact study is expected to 
be published during the spring of 1990

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said wednesday 
that european envoys were returning to iran disgraced by their 
governments actions over the salman rushdie affair tehran radio 
reported 
the 12member european economic community recalled its senior 
diplomats from tehran a month ago to protest khomeinis call for 
moslems to kill rushdie the author of the satanic verses but 
the eec said monday that members were free to return their envoys to 
the iranian capital 
britain said wednesday it will deport nine more iranians 
including two former employees of the iranian embassy in london 
unless they leave voluntarily by monday 
the iranian consulgeneral in hong kong and his family flew back 
to tehran on wednesday the deadline british foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe set for iranian officials to leave the british colony 
staterun tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted khomeini as 
saying the eec envoys were returning humiliated disgraced and 
abject regretting what they did 
it was not immediately know which envoys had returned government 
officials in the netherlands said the nations ambassador wont 
return before sunday 
khomeini issued his death threat against rushdie an indianborn 
british citizen on feb 14 and iranian clerics put a 52 million 
bounty on his head the author since has been in hiding in britain 
iran broke diplomatic relations with britain on march 7 after 
britain refused to ban the satanic verses 
many moslems say the novel is blasphemous they object to a 
brothel scene in which prostitutes take the names of mohammeds 
wives and the suggestion that mohammed wrote the koran instead of 
receiving it from allah 
khomeini who has portrayed the wests defense of the book as a 
campaign against islam ob wednesday called on iranians to endure 
economic hardship to transform islam into a world force 
he acknowledged that irans estimated 55 million people were 
burdened by inflation and shortages but said our people have 
themselves chosen this path and they shall pay its price too 
breaking the back of eastern and western culture is not possible 
without martyrdom 
khomeinis speech was his first major statement since feb 22 
when he denounced moves by less conservative officials to liberalize 
iran following the aug 21 ceasefire in its eightyear war with 
iraq 
as long as i am alive i will not let the state fall into the 
hands of liberals as long as i am alive i will never stop 
cutting off the hands of agents of the united states and the 
ussr tehran radio quoted him as saying 
in a warning to opponents he said if the agents of outsiders 
and the uninformed who have been deceived and have become 
mouthpieces for others do not give up their ways our people will 
undoubtedly banish them mercilessly

iranian rebels said wednesday that 20 
senior revolutionary guards officers had been killed in a purge of 
the fanatical corps ayatollah ruhollah khomeini formed as a 
counterweight to the army 
a statement from the mujahedeen khalq based in iraq said they 
were executed for plotting to assassinate government officials but 
did not identify the officials 
there was no way to confirm the claim which was sent from the 
groups headquarters in baghdad to the associated press in nicosia 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors said the 
commander of the revolutionary guards 7th division in khuzestan 
province mehdi kiani and several of his senior officers were 
arrested in a separate crackdown it said they were being held at 
yoonesku prison in dezful a western city 
reports of unrest in the 350000member corps arose after a 
unsponsored truce aug 20 halted eight years of war with iraq in 
which the revolutionary guards bore the brunt of fighting and 
suffered the heaviest casualties 
despite praise for the guards known in iran as the pasdaran 
some political leaders blamed them for battlefield defeats between 
april and june 1988 that caused khomeinis regime to accept the 
ceasefire 
diplomats and military analysts say a score of rival factions 
have developed within the revolutionary guards often aligned with 
particular clerics in tehran 
many of the good people have become disillusioned philip 
robbins of royal institute of international affairs in london said 
in an interview the corps is fragmented mirroring the divisions 
at the political center 
the mujahedeen khalq quoting sources within the revolutionary 
guards said the 7th division was disbanded after the arrests of 
kiani and the others and its men were moved to widely separated 
areas in three independent brigades 
radicals have gained the ascendancy in tehran over socalled 
pragmatists led by parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
frustrating his effort to end irans isolation and ease religious 
political and social restrictions 
two weeks ago khomeini appointed a clerical aide hojatoleslam 
abdullah nouri as his personal representative to command the 
guards 
nouri is effectively in charge outranking guards commander 
mohsen rezaie and answerable only to khomeini 
in the decree march 9 khomeini said nouri was responsible for 
political ideological intelligence and personnel affairs and had 
the power to appoint or dismiss guards corps commanders 
he said without elaborating that any violation of nouris 
orders will bring reaction 
khomeinis appointment of nouri was seen as a major setback for 
rafsanjani chosen by the patriarch as military commanderinchief 
in june allies in the guards have been a key element of 
rafsanjanis power base 
parliament dismissed mohsen rafiqdoust as revolutionary guards 
minister after the ceasefire accusing him of inefficiency 
squandering funds and failing to enforce discipline rafsanjani 
named an ally ali shamkhani to replace him but nouri now outranks 
him 
whether the officers said to have been executed or arrested were 
linked to rafsanjani is not known but khomeini and other leaders 
had warned the guards recently to stay out of politics 
nouri is the first representative khomeini has sent to guards 
headquarters since hojatoleslam fadlallah mahallati who was killed 
with 39 other senior officials when iraqi fighter planes shot down 
their transport plane over khuzestan in february 1986 
his appointment followed what appeared to be the biggest command 
shakeup since khomeini formed the guards in 1980 because he did not 
trust the army created by shah mohammad reza pahlavi who was 
overthrown the year before 
the strength of the corps has doubled from those days and the 
guards now have their own naval and air wings

a chinese man who says his government 
punished him for having two children and forced his wife to abort a 
third will fight an attempt by immigration officials to send him 
home his attorney said wednesday 
at a hearing feb 2 immigration judge bernard hornbach granted 
political asylum to yun pan lee 26 who had argued he would be 
punished if returned to china because of that countrys strict 
population controls which limit most families to one child 
lee and his wife have two children and a third was forcibly 
aborted in the fifth month by government order said john wu 
lees lawyer the wife and two children are still in china 
the case could have staggering impact said immigration 
lawyer david mainland it could encourage wouldbe chinese 
immigrants to risk illegal entry to the united states by offering 
them new possibilities of asylum he said 
the immigration and naturalization service is appealing the grant 
of asylum saying lee offered scant proof of persecution by the 
chinese government 
it could take more than two years for lees case to come up for a 
hearing with the board of immigration appeals in washington wu said 
lee who is living in new york is determined to remain in this 
country and is seeking a work permit wu said 
lee claimed during the immigration hearing that after his wife 
gave birth to their second son in june 1982 chinese authorities 
paraded him through the streets as a counterrevolutionary cut 
off electricity and water at his home and imposed a heavy school tax 
lee said he obtained a phony passport in singapore and was 
arrested oct 11 when he tried to enter the country through san 
francisco international airport 
ins attorney alberto gonzalez said lees testimony was made 
unbelievable by his implausible and inconsistent stories and 
that he had failed to establish possible persecution by the chinese 
government 
gonzalez said that lee could return to china and escape 
persecution by appealing to higher government officials or moving to 
a district where birth control policy was not so vigorously enforced 
aggressive birth control policies are pursued in most areas of 
china 
wu acknowledged that lee had made conflicting statements to 
immigration officials and later changed his story in court he 
attributed the lapses to lees fear of deportation

in a onetwo punch on the state of americas 
air government figures revealed wednesday that 24 billion pounds 
of toxic chemicals are released annually while 100 million people 
live where other pollutants chiefly from automobiles exceed 
federal standards 
the report on toxic substances poisonous materials released by 
chemical plants and other industries is the first comprehensive 
look at them many have been linked to cancer birth defects 
reproductive dysfunctions neurological disorders and genetic 
mutations 
among the 328 individual and classes of chemicals surveyed were 
60 governmentidentified cancercausing agents methyl isocyanate 
the toxic gas that killed at least 3400 people and injured some 
20000 in bhopal india in december 1984 and phosgene a nerve gas 
used in world war i 
the magnitude of this problem far exceeds our worst fears 
said rep henry waxman dcalif who released the preliminary 
environmental protection agency figures for 1987 at a news 
conference with reps mickey leland dtexas jim florio dnj 
and gerry sikorski dminn 
waxman said the epa has broken commitment after commitment to 
deal with this problem during the 19year life of the clean air 
act and all four lawmakers said theyll soon introduce legislation 
to force the epa to control these emissions 
only seven of the substances are now regulated by the epa 
although a separate agency the occupational safety and health 
administration has set standards for more than 400 toxics in the 
workplace 
donald clay epas top official on air quality issues 
acknowleged that more should be done to protect against toxic 
pollutants but said the agency has been hamstrung in dealing with 
320 separate chemicals one at a time under current law 
the idea of going down 320 separate rules is just too 
cumbersome especially since in many cases industry can be expected 
to contest tighter restrictions in the courts clay told reporters 
adding that some other approach is needed 
he suggested for example dealing with the toxic emissions on a 
source basis instead of each chemical separately as required by 
the 1970 law that envisioned far fewer toxic chemicals than now 
being released 
as to the preliminary epa figures released by waxman clay 
acknowleged the volume of pollutants were greater than he had 
expected its a big number i think its a health problem that 
needs to be addressed 
epa meanwhile released its annual report on air quality and 
concluded more than 100 million americans live in areas where they 
breathe unhealthy air with pollutants exceeding federal standards 
epa said ozone pollution and carbon monoxide emissions both 
largely caused by automobiles remain a major problem especially in 
urban areas 
ozone levels increased 5 percent from 1986 to 1987 and largely 
because of the unusual heat last summer jumped another 14 percent 
in 1988 according to the epa statistics covering 1978 to 1987 for 
five pollutants and through last year for ozone 
epa did however note a longterm reduction of all six of the 
pollutants surveyed 
the comprehensive information on toxics was collected for the 
first time under a community right to know amendment to the 
nations superfund law that passed in the house by a single vote in 
1986 
information was shown on a statebystate basis but sikorski said 
more localized information has been given to each state to inform 
residents of a community about emissions from their local plants 
texas led the nation with 2299 million pounds of toxic emissions 
in 1987 compared with 1345 million pounds for the next highest 
state louisiana tennessee was third with l324 million pounds 
virginia fourth with 1313 million pounds and ohio fifth with 1224 
million pounds 
hawaii had the lowest toxic emissions 9577 pounds with nevada 
the next lowest with 12 million 
the chemical industry led the way in toxic emissions with 8865 
million pounds released followed by the primary metals paper 
transportation equipment and rubberplastics industries 
eparegulated toxics are arsenic asbestos benzene beryllium 
mercury radon222 and vinyl of these only benzene is among the 
top 25 chemicals emitted according to the national wildlife 
federation which issued a separate report based on the epa figures 
the four house members said the toxics situation may be even 
worse than now known because the information is based on industrys 
own estimates and not on actual monitoring 
the inventory only included toxics sent directly into the air 
supply not the millions of pounds released into surface waters or 
soil which eventually evaporate into the air nor did the survey 
include releases from small sources such as dry cleaners and gas 
stations

network the detroit native who lives in los angeles also will 
continue to work for clarks production company as a producer for 
usas camp midnite a latenight talk show on usa network 
i was completely flattered and honored to be asked to audition 
i was extremely nervous hirsch said in quotes provided by 
stephanchak when they told me i was the new host i was 
speechless it was a total shock 
hirsch who was unavailable for interviews wednesday because of 
an unspecified family emergency is a graduate of michigan state 
university he has worked with improvisational comedy groups worked 
as a disc jockey in college and played drums in several bands to 
help pay his way through school 
clark wont be retiring to his malibu beach house to watch gulls

of female sex symbols 
theyre constantly told how wonderful they look but it gets to 
be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go 
he said it would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully

the state department accused the government of 
panama on wednesday of engaging in widespread repression and said 
presidential elections scheduled for may 7 stand little chance of 
being free and fair under present circumstances 
the comment by department spokesman charles redman occurred after 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with the ousted president 
of panama eric arturo delvalle whom the united states continues to 
recognize as the countrys legitimate authority 
baker said he told delvalle that there cannot and will not be 
any movement toward normalization of relations with the panamanian 
government so long as the commander of the defense forces manuel 
antonio noriega retains power 
underscoring the same point redman said there will be no 
accommodation with a noriegadominated regime 
noriega was indicted on drugsmuggling charges last year by two 
florida grand juries a reagan administration effort to negotiate 
noriegas departure from panama collapsed last may 
the election six weeks from now matches the candidate of the 
ruling coalition carlos duque against an opposition leader 
guillermo endara 
but redman citing what he described as control over the 
electoral tribunal by noriegas allies repression of the opposition 
and the suspension of civil liberties said its hard to imagine 
free and fair elections in such an atmosphere 
he added that a large majority of panamanians support 
restoration of a true democratic systerm in panama 
the elections offer an opportunity for a solution to the 
present crisis only if a fair and honest election occurs he said 
a fraudulent electoral result by which noriega retains power 
will only perpetuate the current crisis 
redman indicated however that the administration believes the 
opposition should not withdraw from the election process despite 
restrictions he said there are impressive manifestations that 
the opposition has achieved momentum 
the hardline us policy toward noriega has prompted speculation 
that the united states may be trying to scrap the panama canal 
treaties under which the waterway is due to revert to panamanian 
control at the end of 1999 
but redman said the united states is firmly and unequivocally 
committed to the spirit and the letter of the treaties 
delvalle told an interviewer this week that he moved to miami 
about two months ago until then he had been living in hiding in 
panama following his ouster in a noriegaled coup in february 1988 
delvalle still considers himself to be panamas constitutional 
president the countrys embassy here continues to be run by a 
delvalle loyalist juan b sosa

a bipartisan coalition of house members 
concerned that rural hospitals are an endangered species proposed 
legislation wednesday to improve and ensure the availability of 
health care in small towns and rural areas 
the federal government will determine whether rural hospitals 
survive rep byron dorgan dnd said at a news conference 
twothirds of them in this country are now losing money and 
losing big money many of them will not be around unless we do 
something affirmatively to solve the problem 
one of the main efforts of an estimated 150 million package of 
legislation proposed by the rural health care coalition a group of 
about 100 lawmakers from 42 states is to shift more money to rural 
hospitals through the medicare reimbursement system 
since 1980 163 rural hospitals have closed lawmakers contend 
that the medicare payment system discriminates against hospitals and 
physicians in rural areas providing them with lower payments than 
their urban counterparts for the same health care treatment for 
elderly patients 
for hospitals there is an overall 11 percent differential 
between payments to urban and rural hospitals one proposal calls 
for eliminating the gap over three years by increasing annual 
payment adjustments to rural hospitals and slowing increases to 
urban institutions lawmakers also said they would work to equalize 
payments to physicians 
rep tom tauke riowa said the reimbursement change would not 
boost overall federal spending but would represent a 
redistribution of funds 
other proposals in the package would 
provide additional medicare payments to some rural hospitals to 
ensure that reimbursements cover reasonable costs of providing 
care those eligible would be hospitals with fewer than 100 beds and 
in which medicare patients account for at least 55 percent of their 
business 
make it easier to establish rural health clinics through a 
program established in 1977 legislation would give more flexibility 
in staffing and provide medicare coverage for services of clinical 
social workers 
provide a 45 million block grant to help states improve 
emergency medical services in rural areas including money for 
training and to purchase equipment 
provide 50 million to help states improve the availability of 
prenatal and early childhood health care services among other 
things the measure is to streamline the process for lowincome 
women to enroll in health and nutrition programs rep mike synar 
dokla said maternal and infant mortality rates were higher in 
rural areas than urban centers

drug manufacturers are warning doctors that 
commonly prescribed arthritis and painrelieving drugs pose a 
serious risk of peptic ulcers intestinal perforations and other 
gastrointestinal problems the food and drug administration said 
wednesday 
the fda is requiring manufacturers to add to their labels a 
warning reporting that studies show up to 4 percent of patients on 
longterm therapy with these drugs may have serious gastrointestinal 
reactions 
the new labeling is required for voltaren nalfon tolectin 
indocin dolobid meclomen feldene ponstel anaprox naprosyn 
orudis butazolidin rufen motrin ansaid and several generic 
versions of ibuprofen indomethacin and phenylbutazone 
nonprescription ibuprofen does not have to carry the new warning 
because the risk of serious reactions with overthecounter products 
appears to be much less particularly if they are taken as 
directed over a shorter period of time the fda said 
these drugs known as nonsteroidal antiinflamatory drugs have 
largely replaced steroid treatments because they are considered 
safer some of the drugs also are approved for pain and menstrual 
cramps 
the drugs also are being prescribed for tendinitis sprains and 
strains or joint and muscle pain but the fda said the new labeling 
advises that these conditions can sometimes be treated adequately 
with other therapies 
clinical studies show that one in 100 patients treated for three 
to six months with these drugs suffers gastrointestinal problems at 
some time during treatment and that two to four patients out of 100 
treated for one year develop the problems 
the gastrointestinal problems appear to be more serious among the 
elderly and disabled the fda said

the nuclear regulatory commissions payment of 
4000 to a witness to testify against the agencys no 2 plant 
investigator seems to be part of a commission strategy to undermine 
the nrcs investigative unit two lawmakers charged wednesday 
the mishandling of the fortuna investigation appears to be 
part of an ongoing effort by the nrc to undermine the effectiveness 
and independence of the agencys office of investigations reps 
sam gejdenson dconn and george miller dcalif said in a 
letter to nrc chairman lando w zech jr 
the office of investigations probes wrongdoing by plant 
operators the nrc has been accused by some lawmakers of being too 
soft on the industry it is assigned to regulate 
nrc spokesman frank ingram declined comment saying the case 
involving roger a fortuna deputy director of the investigations 
office was continuing the nrc wants to fire fortuna citing his 
refusal to testify before a court reporter 
the unusual payment of an nrc witness was disclosed by gejdenson 
who provided the associated press with a copy of an nrc purchase 
order that authorized douglas s ellison to be paid 40 per hour for 
the 100 hours of effort estimated under this contract plus 117 
a day in expenses 
that the nrc would pay a witness for information and sworn 
affidavits and testimony is disgraceful the lawmakers said it 
makes a mockery of nrcs investigative process and discredits the 
commission as a whole 
ellison was a technician at an upstate new york nuclear plant who 
last year accused fortuna of misconduct leading to the commissions 
desire to have fortuna provide sworn statements about the 
allegations 
the nrc document listed ellison as a contractor hired for 
consulting services in an interview wednesday ellison said he 
provided the commission with testimony and evidence against fortuna 
and other nrc employees 
sharon connelly the nrc official who headed the fortuna 
investigation declined to comment on specifics of the case but 
said she was assured by commission attorneys that it was legal to 
pay witnesses 
gejdenson and miller did not question the legality of the 
payment but said it is simply unconscionable that the commission 
would pay an individual 4000 for information to be used against an 
nrc employee 
ellison was employed as a technician at the nine mile point plant 
in scriba ny when he told nrc investigators about alleged safety 
problems at the plant fortuna decided against pursuing the 
allegations and federal prosecutors in syracuse ny declined 
prosecution according to gejdenson 
in august ellison accused fortuna of criminal misconduct 
charging the nrc official discussed sensitive and confidential nrc 
information and strategies concerning several oi investigations with 
unauthorized third parties and matters involving ellison with 
third parties according to a partial transcript of his sept 12 
sworn testimony 
at least one of those third parties was stephen b comley a 
massachusetts antinuclear activist ellison provided the nrc with 
five tapes of conversations between comley and ellison ellison and 
fortuna and fortuna and comley according to the transcript 
ellison said he has 42 tapes of conversations with various nrc 
and plant officials he said he recorded the conversations secretly 
by strapping a minature tape recorder around his ankle and attaching 
a small microphone to his belt 
in an interview from new smyrna beach fla ellison said he 
never asked the nrc for the payment and was willing to give the 
agency his information he said he now believes that the nrc paid 
him to keep the information about fortuna and other highranking 
agency officials from reaching the public 
the nrcs contract with ellison under a section titled special 
terms and conditions specifies that ellison may not discuss 
this contract or the information to be furnished the nrc hereunder 
with any person 
the effect of it was to gag me to prevent me from going in 
front of the media ellison said he said before the contract was 
offered he warned nrc officials that he was going to scream fire 
and foul play if they did not take action against fortuna and 
others

president bush flew here from washington 
the nations murder capital to tell high school students that 
rising drug use in this pristine pastoral area of amish farms shows 
how vulnerable every american city and town is to the menace 
but he told his audience the good news is youre fighting 
back with homegrown efforts to stop young people from using drugs 
before they ever begin 
from here he shuttled to wilmington del to proclaim that 
drugs are not an issue with shades of gray it involves good guys 
and bad guys white hats and black hats good and evil 
preceded on stage at lancasters conestoga valley high school by 
a young man who told how drugs had wrecked his life the president 
railed against casual drug use and reiterated his pledge to destroy 
foreign drug crops and the labs that process their harvest 
addressing 3000 students and parents packed into the school gym 
bush told the crowd 
together lets you and me send a message on drug abuse to the 
socalled casual user face up to the fact that your socalled 
recreational drug use contributes to the drug culture to the crime 
the death and degradation associated with the drug trade 
he pointed to efforts being made to keep young people from 
experimenting with drugs and said americans must get the message 
across that drugs are not a form of entertainment drugs are a 
poison to users and to our communities 
he pointed to dare a program begun by los angeles police and 
schools to drugproof our children 
ive been out there he said dare sends these police 
officers into the classroom to work with the kids build their 
selfesteem teach them that they can refuse when theyre pressured 
to try drugs 
dare drug abuse resistance education says it is active in 
1200 communities in 48 states 
he also pointed to two local programs that target potential drug 
users from grade school through high school as part of the education 
effort and said they do something to prevent drug problems before 
they begin 
he even sought out amish parents to ask why among their children 
the drug problem seems to be nonexistent or hopefully 
nonexistent 
meeting with a dozen members of the countrys secondlargest 
amish community bush asked why is it that you all have been able 
to withstand the pressures and others have not 
as if answering his own question he asked faith 
one amish leader said he believed the answer lay in the fact that 
amish youth if true to the faith have no access to television 
radio and sexual things 
statistics for lancaster county make bushs point about the 
increase in drug activity but also show it is far behind the 
district of columbia where officials have said much of the record 
homicide rate 594 per 100000 residents in 1988 is linked to drug 
activity 
reported drug crimes in lancaster county an area known largely 
for its farms and tourist attractions rose 32 percent from 1983 
through 1987 from 326 to 433 in an area that last year had 380000 
residents 
in washington reported drug crimes rose 83 percent over the same 
period from 6004 to 10977 in a city with 628500 residents last 
year 
lancaster county authorities say that a countywide drug task 
force created five months ago has already seized 800000 worth of 
virtually pure cocaine and 19000 worth of heroin 
the rising problem here simply shows how vulnerable every 
american city and town is to the menace of drug abuse bush said 
while the presidents focus in lancaster was on preventive 
education his thrust in wilmington where he addressed the delaware 
state criminal justice community was on law enforcement efforts 
against drug traffickers 
we must destroy crops and the labs that produce them in foreign 
countries bush said adding that he proposes to spend 690 
million for coast guard drug interdiction efforts and 300 million 
on defense department drug programs 
we are in this with our friends south of the border the 
president said weve got to destroy the crops and the labs that 
process the crops in these drugproducing countries

a 1 billion contract to build advanced radar 
screens for the us air traffic control system is likely to go to a 
japanese television manufacturer because no american company is 
ready to bid on the project a house panel was told wednesday 
zenith electronics corp chairman jerry k pearlman said only two 
companies both japanese bid on the contract to provide 
highresolution picture tubes for 31inch terminals in the federal 
aviation administration air traffic control centers 
pearlman said the terminals are to be installed in 1992 and 1993 
but that american electronics companies were unable to bid because 
they dont yet possess the technology 
there is not presently an american solution available 
pearlman said 
he called the contract the largest highresolution display 
purchase in the world and said it was part of the 3 billion 
upgrade the faa plans for its air controller equipment 
pearlmans testimony drew swift responses from members of the 
house science space and technology committee which held the 
hearing to consider ways the government can spur us entry into 
what proponents of advanced television say will be a 140 billion 
business in 20 years 
rep robert a roe dnj the committee chairman said the 
panel would look into the case and said pearlmans testimony may 
provide the issue he needs to attract public attention to the 
dilemma facing the us electronics industry as japanese and 
european competitors race to gain the upper hand in the tv 
technology of the 21st century 
he urged witnesses before the hearing to expand their discussion 
of advanced television technology to its many possible uses such as 
in medicine education and the military so i can tell the 
congress of the united states that this is not just a bigger 
brighter picture on a television tube 
pearlman said the usbased zenith which has combined with ibm 
to build a hdtv system might be able to bid on the faa contract if 
the installation schedule were delayed about a year and if zenith 
could find 21 million in research funds 
he said the 30 million in seed money the pentagon is offering 
private enterprise for hdtv development will only scratch the 
surface 
he said 100 million a year for three to four years matched by 
an equal or greater amount by industry is required i assure you 
that the industry is ready willing and able to make these 
investments 
the committee heard from a string of government and industry 
witnesses who said development of hdtv technology will have an 
enormous impact on other areas such as computers and communications 
hdtv will be a technology driver said alfred sikes director 
of the commerce departments national telecommunications and 
information administration 
sikes took some heat from members of the committee who thought 
commerce had not been providing leadership in developing a 
coherent government policy on hdtv development 
rep george e brown jr dcalif who like ritter has 
introduced a bill to spur governmentprivate sector hdtv research 
said he was disappointed that commerce has not moved more 
aggressively to develop strategy 
sikes assured brown however that hdtv was at the very apex 
of commerce secretary robert mosbachers priorities 
the witnesses were nearly unanimous in urging government 
assistance either monetary or in tax credits antitrust exemptions 
or through industrygovernment hdtv consortia 
they also urged vigorous enforcement of existing trade laws to 
protect the us electronics industry from predatory pricing 
practices from competing nations 
solomon j buchsbaum executive vice president of atampt bell 
laboratories said us leadership in information and computing 
services was at stake 
unless a way can be found either by industry directly or 
aided by the government for us industry to supply a lions share 
of any future domestic hdtv market we will risk losing not only our 
share of the coming hdtv wave but even our share of the highly 
prized telecommunications and computer markets

more than 100 million americans live with 
polluted air that at times exceeds federal health standards but 
officials said wednesday air quality is markedly better than it was 
a decade ago 
the environmental protection agencys annual report on air 
quality singled out ozone pollution and carbon monoxide emissions 
both largely blamed on automobiles as being of continuing concern 
in urban areas where air pollution problems are greatest 
ozone levels increased 5 percent between 1986 and 1987 and jumped 
another 14 percent in 1988 because of increased pollution and a 
particularly hot summer that aggravated the problem ozone is the 
chief ingredient of smog which plagues many urban areas 
the epa report tracked air quality from 1978 to 1987 for five 
pollutants and through 1988 for ozone which is formed when 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides interact in sunlight and heat 
across the board the longterm figures showed significant 
improvements in levels of each of six major pollutants although in 
the most recent years the progress in combating some of the 
pollutants has been slowed or even reversed 
epa administrator william k reilly although noting progress in 
some areas said the figures on ozone and carbon monoxide 
underscores the need for stronger air quality laws 
donald clay the agencys top official for air quality called 
the ozone pollution probably the most pervasive health problem 
that we have among the pollutants examined the epa estimated that 
886 million people live in counties where ozone pollution exceeded 
federal standards at some point in 1987 and 1988 
last year the epa listed 66 areas of the country where ozone 
levels were considered unhealthy and early indications are that 
about 30 additional areas may eventually join the list said the 
epa 
in addition to ozone the pollutants covered by the air quality 
report were sulfur dioxide a source of acid rain which also can 
cause lung damage carbon monoxide a pollutant largely from 
automobiles which can seriously affect the heart and brain nitrogen 
dioxide which contributes to bronchitis and pneumonia ambient 
lead which can cause brain and nervous system damage and suspended 
particulates that cause breathing problems 
here are the epa assessments for each 
carbon monoxide levels in the air were cut by 32 percent since 
1978 and 6 percent from 1986 to 1987 but actual emissions were 
slightly higher in 1987 than the previous year the increase was 
blamed on forest fires 
but an estimated 294 million people continue to live in counties 
where carbon monoxide levels exceed federal standards while the 
highest concentration during an eighthour period in 1987 was found 
in new york city 21 metropolitan areas in all exceeded the federal 
standards 
sulfur dioxide levels in the air were cut 35 percent since 1978 
and 3 percent in 1987 from the previous year almost all regions of 
the country fell within federal standards for sulfur dioxide the 
exception was pittsburgh where a monitoring site reported levels 
higher than the epa considers healthy in a region with 16 million 
people 
nitrogen dioxide levels have been reduced by 12 percent since 
1978 but ambient levels showed no change during the last year of 
the study period emissions of nitrogen dioxide actually increased 
slightly from 1986 to 1987 
levels are relatively high in the northeast but the los angeles 
area with a population of more than 75 million is the only region 
in the country where ambient nitrogen dioxide exceeds federal 
standards 
lead this showed the greatest improvement largely because of 
the gradual switch since 1978 to use of unleaded gasoline ambient 
lead levels fell 88 percent from 1978 including a 19 percent 
reduction from 1986 to 1987 
but the epa reported that 17 million people most of them near 
industrial plants using lead continue to be exposed to air that 
exceeds federal ambient lead levels of 15 micrograms per cubic 
liter 
suspended particulates these include dirt dust and soot 
levels have been reduced by 21 percent since 1978 but ambient 
levels increased by 3 percent in 1987 over the previous year the 
epa blamed the increase on forest fires nearly 22 million people 
lived in counties where the levels exceeded federal standards

president bush said wednesday he didnt 
think it possible for some drug guy to come into the white house 
and start offering it up 
and if a drugdealer tried to get him to use drugs bush said 
i hope id say hey get lost 
the president was responding to a question raised by a boy who 
was among about a dozen young people who gave bush a karate 
demonstration here as part of physical awareness program aimed at 
encouraging youths to avoid drugs 
have you ever been offered drugs a young boy asked the 
president who was seated in the bleachers with the karate kids 
no see you know ill tell you something they had drugs 
around when i was a little guy but i hate to tell you how old i 
am said bush 64 it wasnt as much there wasnt the pressure 
on kids in schools its just kind of come in more lately you 
know 
a few moments later bush was asked what do you do to keep 
drugs out of your life 
well kind of getting along in my level of life here the 
pressures arent quite that big the president said you dont 
have a lot of guys coming up to you in daily life saying hey 
so i dont have the temptations and the pressures that youve 
got like young guys in school and all of that he added but i 
think if i did id try to do what youre doing id try to have 
that lifestyle going in such a way and helping the law enforcement 
so people wouldnt be tempted to offer up those narcotics 
but im not saying its the pressure the same he said 
now like im president it would be pretty hard for some drug guy 
to come into the white house and start offering it up you know 
weve got a lot of secret service guys there hey throw them right 
out of there but i bet if they did i hope i would say hey 
get lost we dont want any of that

a program that puts police in classrooms to 
teach kids the dangers of drug abuse started with 10 officers and a 
few schools but now involves 3 million youngsters in 48 states and 
several foreign countries 
dare which stands for drug abuse resistance education was the 
brainchild of los angeles police chief daryl gates said capt mike 
bostic who heads up the departments dare division 
during a brainstorming session in 1983 gates reasoned that his 
police force could do only so much about the drug supply put so 
many dealers in jail and intercept so much contraband so we must 
eliminate the demand bostic said 
he figured we had to teach kids to resist peer pressure and one 
of the best ways would be to have police officers teach kids about 
it in elementary school he said 
los angeles unified school district officials then wrote and 
developed a 17week curriculum for fifth and sixthgraders 
stressing the longterm rewards of sports family and church are 
greater than the quick kick of drugs 
the emphasis of the program is to get to kids before they have 
to make decisions it teaches kids accurate information about drugs 
and alcohol bostic said 
before that we used scare tactics this will kill you your 
life will fall apart dont do it because some horrible thing is 
going to happen to you kids are not dumb they see people who have 
used drugs and that hasnt happened to them kids are much more 
sophisticated today 
the dare program has been adopted by at least one community in 
every state except delaware and north dakota it has also been 
adopted in australia canada new zealand and american samoa it is 
used by the bureau of indian affairs at many reservation schools and 
by department of defense schools worldwide the sixthlargest 
school district in the world bostic said 
dare has become the official state program in illinois virginia 
north carolina arizona kentucky washington and michigan said los 
angeles deputy chief glenn levant of the departments bureau of 
special investigations 
in addition hawaii kansas tennessee and ohio are expected to 
adopt the plan this year he said 
in los angeles the program has a staff of 86 people including 
67 officers around the world 2400 officers are involved bostic 
said 
our statistics show that 3 million kids will go through the 
program in 1989 and about 50000 classrooms will be used to teach 
it he said 
when the program started in los angeles 10 officers worked 50 
schools a semester today it has spread to 538 schools in the city 
district the nations secondlargest school district with nearly 
600000 students it is also used by 128 other communities in 
california 
dare budgets are limited to the salaries of the officers and 
support personnel involved 
the program will take a generation or two to make an impact 
bostic said 
there are 37 million kids in kindergarten through 12th grade in 
the united states until dare goes nationwide and 37 million kids go 
through the program it will be a full generation before we see 
the impact we are looking for

the department of housing and urban development 
said wednesday it has suspended drg financial corp a private 
lender and underwriter of multifamily housing loans because of 
irregularities and criminal allegations 
the suspension of drg financial corp based in washington and 
its affiliates means the company cannot participate in federal 
programs or procurement contracts pending further proceedings 
hud said in a statement that the suspension is the result of 
irregularities in the companys dealings with government national 
mortgage association gnma and the federal housing administration 
and serious allegations of criminal activities under 
investigation by the federal bureau of investigation 
hud secretary jack kemp said the suspension was to protect the 
public interest and the integrity of the co insurance program of 
hud 
hud did not say how much money was involved but documents showed 
drg was in default on more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 
loans as of late 1987 
donald m defranceaux president of drg funding corp an 
affiliated company did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
a secretary answering the phone at his office diane pontisso said 
at this time we have no comment 
in a letter to defranceaux hud general deputy assistant 
secretary james e schoenberger cited evidence drg violated guaranty 
agreements with gnma involving the recovery of principal to security 
holders for a dozen housing projects he also said there was 
evidence drg submitted false information to gnma regarding the 
recovery of principal from the sale of foreclosed projects 
drg as a participant in huds multifamily housing coinsurance 
program handled mortgage loans and underwrote them as a coinsurer 
sharing the risk with hud on fha projects 
hud said the fbi acting under a search warrant searched drgs 
offices in january 
last september gnma took control of drgs portfolio of coinsured 
loans contending drg failed to pass through to holders of gnma 
mortgagebacked securities the sales proceeds of certain projects 
which drg had acquired through default and sold the portfolio 
totaled 11 billion hud said 
in a january 1988 audit report the hud inspector general said 
drg was violating coinsurance requirements had underwritten 
unsound loans had failed to detect indications of troubled loans 
and had not taken timely action to minimize losses 
it said that as of sept 30 1987 12 percent of drgs loans in 
one hud program were in default representing more than 253 million 
in outstanding principal and accrued interest 
hud said the actions against drg have no effect on residents of 
buildings with mortgages insured by drg

food subsidies paid for by saudi arabias oil 
sales have turned that country into a growing and muchsought market 
for foreign suppliers including the united states an agriculture 
department report said wednesday 
over the last five years saudi food imports averaged nearly 5 
billion annually up from 15 billion in 1977 
john a williams the departments agricultural trade officer in 
jeddah saudi arabia says the growth has been fueled by the 
presence of thousands of european and us expatriates and elaborate 
consumer food subsidies financed by saudi arabias oil wealth 
an influx of immigrant workers in the mid1970s dramatically 
changed saudi consumer spending patterns williams writes in the 
april issue of agexporter magazine 
in 1987 saudi arabia which has a population of about 11 
million imported about 70 percent of its food needs tops in value 
were barley live sheep tobacco milk poultry meat rice spices 
canned vegetables fruit juices fresh vegetables sugar and corn 
more than 10 percent of the agricultural imports are from the 
united states making saudi arabia the top cash customer in the 
middle east for us farm products 
consumer subsidies are used to distribute national income 
derived almost entirely from petroleum williams said 
in 1987 oil comprised 92 percent of saudi arabias total exports 
of 25 billion total imports were put at 19 billion including 
45 billion worth of agricultural products the us share was 
about 486 million

so many chrysler corp assembly line workers 
couldnt read the words bad hood fit on the button they were 
supposed to push when they detected an illfitting hood that the 
company had to replace the words with a graphic depiction chrysler 
chairman lee a iacocca said wednesday 
iacocca urging business to do all it can to help president bush 
become the education president said he was getting more scared 
every day about the decline of american education 
i thought it was bad but ive found out its really really 
bad he told a luncheon meeting of the national association of 
manufacturers 
as for the bad hood fit button which workers were supposed 
to push to alert others to improperly aligned hoods as cars passed 
by on the assembly line iacocca said we had to replace that with 
graphics because the guys just couldnt handle those three 
monosyllables 
if you dont have people who are smarter than the robots they 
work with the game is over in trade competition iacocca said 
reminding his audience that bush said he wanted to be remembered as 
the education president 
each one of us ought to do everything we can to help him get 
his wish iacocca said in urging business executives to demand 
higher standards of educational achievement and to support measures 
aimed at elevating the professionalism and status of teachers 
we used to write our training material at chrysler at the ninth 
and 12th grade reading levels iacocca said 
but we found we were out of sync because a lot of people in the 
plants and i mean a lot i dont want to give you the numbers 
its frightening they were only reading at the sixth grade level 
so we had to translate everything down sometimes even sixth 
grade isnt enough 
chrysler spends 117 million a year on training 10 percent of it 
for elementary reading writing and arithmetic you and i are 
spending more money teaching remedial mathematics to our employees 
than all the grade schools high schools and colleges in the country 
are spending on mathematics instruction iacocca said 
in detroit only 75 percent of enrolled high school students 
attend class on an average day and of the citys school budget 
only 30 percent goes to actual basic education thats frontline 
teaching i inquired what the hell is the other 70 
administration and support support for what 
chrysler corp is the sole sponsor of a major public broadcasting 
service series called learning in america which begins monday 
night the company put up nearly 4 million to make and promote the

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
said wednesday that recent economic reports provide the first 
visible evidence of accelerating price increases supporting the 
central banks policy of driving up interest rates 
but in response to a question at a house banking subcommittee 
hearing he said the conditions that led to interest rates in the 
high teens in the 1980s are not present today 
greenspan defended the central banks yearlong program of what 
he described as aggressive credit tightening which has pumped 
up shortterm interest rates by more than three percentage points to 
about 9 percent 
president bush since taking office has been openly skeptical 
about the degree of inflationary pressure and the need to increase 
interest rates on tuesday bush again told reporters the federal 
reserve should be aware that higher interest rates could push the 
country into a recession 
greenspan said it has appeared to the central bank early on 
that underlying inflationary pressures were emerging he has 
previously cited tight labor markets and strained factory capacity 
but he told the panel that those pressures had not been visible in 
government inflation measures until the last month or two 
wholesale price inflation in january and february was running at 
a 126 percent annual rate up from 4 percent last year according 
to the labor department retail prices were increasing at a 61 
percent annual rate up from 44 percent in 1987 and 1988 in 
response stock and bond markets have dropped 
clearly obviously the last two months inflation data has 
shaken the markets and in a sense they are a reflection of forces 
that have been evolving all along greenspan said 
the purpose of our raising rates is to address what we 
believe to be emerging inflationary pressures and expectations that 
if left unchecked would lead to a very signficant recession 
he said 
but asked if the interest rates would soar toward 20 percent 
greenspan said current economic conditions are not comparable to 
those in the late 1970s that led to the doubledigit inflation of 
the early 1980s 
the central bank chairman acknowledged that rising rates are 
hurting the ailing savings and loan industry but he contended that 
sampls and the economy would have been worse off if the fed had not 
acted rates would have risen even more sharply on their own in 
response to spiraling inflation he said 
its our view that the actions we have taken to date probably 
have made interest rates certainly in the long end of the market 
significantly lower than they would have otherwise been he said 
greenspan noted that private economists are divided in their 
opinion of the feds performance with some analysts contending the 
central bank has tightened too much and others indicating it hasnt 
tightened enough 
he said the full growthslowing effect of the feds credit 
tightening hasnt been felt yet noting significant lags between 
central bank action and the response in the economy 
recent economic reports indicate some softening of the economy in 
february retail sales industrial production and orders for big 
ticket durable goods lasting for more than three years have all 
fallen

private exporters have sold china an additional 
400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part of 2 million 
tons authorized feb 27 for china under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the latest sale boosted to about 82 million tons the amount of 
wheat sold to china for 198889 delivery under eep 
sims said the latest sales were handled by cargill inc 195000 
tons louis dreyfus corp 50000 bartlett and co 30000 
ferruzzi usa inc 85000 and richco grain ltd 40000 
the wheat was sold for shipment in may and will carry an average 
subsidy rate of 1994 per ton or about 54 cents a bushel he said 
slightly more than 12 million tons are still available under the 
current authorization 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 400000 tons would be about 147 million bushels and 
at recent prices of about 416 per bushel would have a farm value 
of around 61 million

a judge allowed a 14yearold girl to 
return home wednesday after a sevenweek eviction forced by 
neighbors in a bitter 18month dispute over deed restrictions 
barring kids 
pasco circuit judge wayne cobb sided with the family of staci 
elmer who maintained age discrimination was illegal under federal 
housing law that took effect 10 days ago 
he lifted an injunction barring the girl from her parents mobile 
home in zephyrhills a rural community northeast of the tampa bay 
area 
staci was kicked out of the elmer family home jan 31 after cobb 
told her parents to remove her or face jail for contempt the elmers 
live in a rural 17unit mobilehome community which had a deed 
restriction forbidding children younger than 15 
staci turns 15 on april 7 
for seven weeks she has been living with a married brother 
several miles away and coming visting home on weekends 
mary greenwood attorney for parents beverly and thomas elmer 
told the judge the fair housing amendments of 1988 made the issue 
moot she maintained the injunction was unlawful because deed 
restriction had been rendered illegal 
i think the injunction became void as of march 12 the day 
the new law took effect ms greenwood told the judge 
he agreed 
this court cannot continue an injunction in violation of the 
law the federal act now makes these deed restrictions unlawful and 
im going to dissolve the injunction cobb said at the end of a 
20minute hearing 
steve herman attorney for the elderly neighbors in the 
classaction suit argued that the judge should defer his ruling to 
give the mobile home owners reasonable time to familiarize 
themselves with the new law which prohibits with few exceptions 
age discrimination in housing 
eight neighbors were in court they left quickly after the 
judges ruling without comment 
mrs elmer said she would move staci back home wednesday night 
it makes my heart feel good to hear a judge say no matter how 
old she is she can be in there with her family 
the neighbors have been upset since i moved in there i cant 
imagine theyll be any different at all she said

members of parliament said wednesday they 
are being taken for granted in talks between the government and the 
solidarityled opposition and one proposed legalizing independent 
political parties for the first time since 1948 
authorities and the opposition decided to prolong historic 
negotiations on polands future into an eighth week during haggling 
over the powers of a new president and senate 
the sejm or parliament began considering wednesday the 
governments package of bills meant to transform accords from the 
roundtable talks into law 
constitutional changes on the agenda included creating a freely 
elected senate and a strong presidency also up for discussion were 
laws on elections in june trade unions clubs and associations and 
farmers unions 
the laws were only being introduced and referred to committees 
but several in the 460member chamber protested that they were 
expected to rubberstamp decisions made in the talks 
wiktor leyk a nonparty member of parliament affiliated with the 
christian social union was applauded when he said the talks should 
not replace constitutionally appointed legislative and executive 
institutions 
opposition and government negotiators meanwhile were trying to 
resolve remaining obstacles to a final agreement the government 
promised that any agreements reached can be inserted into the bills 
before the sejm votes on them 
in a setback for the talks timetable solidarity spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz announced wednesday there was no hope of 
concluding an agreement before the easter holidays the 
negotiations due to end thursday will stretch into next week 
because wednesdays talks were going too slowly he said 
opposition sources said it appeared uncertain an april 3 target 
date for signing the final accord could be met 
but politburo member janusz reykowski told reporters there has 
been nothing that would make us think this date would be changed 
both sides reported agreement wednesday on granting independent 
groups access to statecontrolled mass media the opposition was 
promised a daily newspaper and two weeklies and permission to act 
as host for a national radio show and a tv show censorship is to be 
eased 
no progress emerged on an opposition demand for indexed pay 
raises to counter polands 60percentplus inflation solidarity has 
vowed to sign no agreement without indexation 
the general aspects of the accord have already been settled 
solidarity and other opposition groups banned since the 1981 
martiallaw crackdown would be legalized in exchange they would 
agree to take part in sejm elections in which a communistcontrolled 
coalition would be guaranteed 65 percent of the seats 
but a senate would be created to which elections would be totally 
democratic for the first time in the communist bloc opposition 
candidates would be free to run and compete directly against 
communist candidates 
the price for a freely elected senate is creation of a state 
president with strong powers serving a sixyear term the president 
would be elected by the sejm and the senate and the communist party 
could count on obtaining the office 
in the parliamentary debate the communistallied democratic 
party called for another major reform a law to allow independent 
political parties to form for the first time since 1948 but it said 
such parties should be regulated 
the constitution does not mention the possibility of forming 
political parties other than the democratic party and the united 
peasants party both named in the constitution as junior partners 
of a communistled ruling coalition 
but in the recent reform climate several political clubs 
have sprung up that say they would like to act as independent 
political parties 
the democratic party demands a separate law on political 
parties regulating the form of their establishment and the 
principles of their relations with other legal entities said 
democratic deputy jerzy wojcik 
several deputies expressed concern that decisions taken at the 
round table threatened to diminish parliaments constitutional 
authority 
nonparty deputy malgorzata niepokulczycka complained the sejm 
was being used to give hurried approval to roundtable accords 
another deputy demanding anonymity angrily remarked during a 
break in the session we have always been told the sejm is the 
supreme authority in this country and now it turns out the most 
crucial decisions were taken somewhere else 
reykowski said deputies should not feel mistreated he said the 
talks represent a joint appeal for action by a spectrum of social 
forces but the decisions must be made by the organs which are 
authorized by law 
because the sejm is controlled by communist party deputies who 
are bound by party discipline any legislation agreed upon by the 
party leadership in the past has always been assured of passage

house republicans elected rightwing activist 
newt gingrich of georgia to their no 2 leadership post wednesday 
and charted a course for battle with the ruling democrats 
gingrich the chief accuser of house speaker jim wright and the 
publicityhungry leader of a neoconservative faction declared he 
would build a much more aggressive activist party 
im going to be happiest when two republicans are debating an 
issue on tv and theres no room for a democrat he said 
gingrich 45 was elected minority whip over rep edward madigan 
of illinois 8785 in a secret ballot of house republicans who 
hold 174 of the 435 house seats one republican was absent and 
another voted for other 
the vote for gingrich was widely taken as a rebuke of the lowkey 
style of the current republican leadership and as reflecting a 
desire in the house gop to concentrate more effort on attacking the 
democrats instead of working with them on legislation 
as whip newts task will be to count votes create consensus 
or piece together a majority for initiatives sponsored by the bush 
administration said rep tony coelho the house democratic whip 
thats a tough job under any circumstances more so for someone 
whos stood apart from the legislative process so often he said 
newt has consistently attacked democrats now hes going to be 
asking for our votes 
republicans have not held a majority in the house since president 
eisenhowers first term and gingrich was able to capitalize on 
feelings of frustration in the republican ranks at their status and 
shabby treatment by the democrats 
after his election gingrich telephoned democratic leader thomas 
s foley dwash and coelho and said he looked forward to meeting 
with them he did not call wright telling reporters that would be 
a delicate and difficult relationship at best 
the speaker said he hoped for civility asked if he were going to 
call gingrich and offer congratulations he said i hadnt thought 
to do that or send flowers champagne all of the above 
later wright sent gingrich a copy of his book reflections of 
a public man the book figuring prominently in an ethics probe 
against wright with gingrich currently defending criticism of a 
book deal of his own wright inscribed it for newt who likes 
books too 
house minority leader bob michel rill who had quietly 
supported madigan for the job appeared at the postelection news 
conference with gingrich and acknowledged that his colleagues were 
not satisfied with the status quo 
they want us to be more activated and more visible and more 
aggressive he said who said his style had been to pick his 
fights theres such a frustration on our side at being mired down 
in the minority he said 
with gingrich a neophyte at the votecounting and legislative 
role of the whip and more inclined to entering the public debate 
michel said he might have to go with the flow and carry out some 
whips duties himself 
gingrich said he too would change and insisted he could work 
with the democrats he promised to work with michel but he also 
made clear that the whip job would have to adjust to him 
ed madigan would have been a perfect traditional whip hes a 
tremendous legislative craftsman gingrich said i think the 
party wanted a new job description 
gingrich received a congratulatory telephone call from president 
bush who was traveling in pennsylvania and former president 
reagan but gingrich told reporters he would not be pushing the new 
presidents program if that put him in conflict with the wishes of 
the house republicans 
the sixthterm congressman benefited from the backing of rep guy 
vander jat of michigan the head of the house republican campaign 
organization the campaign group is dominated by people who worked 
against bush in favor of more conservative candidates 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater issued a 
statement saying he was confident that our party will continue to 
present a united front to the american people 
gingrich campaigned as the man most feared by the democrats and 
he was the one who filed the complaint that led to current the house 
ethics committee investigation of wright dtexas 
ironically gingrichs election to the leadership post might help 
wright 
a major charge against wright involves a bookpublishing contract 
that gave him an unusually generous royalty 
it was reported this week that gingrich used an unusual 
partnership deal in publicizing his own book democrats have 
indicated they are preparing to file charges against gingrich and 
target him in other ways 
lawmakers of both parties said there was risk to the legislative 
process with gingrichs election 
as we turn up the partisan cross fire the chance of dealing 
with the really substantive issues that this country has to deal 
with become smaller and smaller said rep charles schumer dny 
republican rep bill green of new york said gingrich would have 
to change in his new role and will face frustration because in 
seeking enactment of president bushs programs hell have to work 
with the democrats 
its the dilemma that newt is going to have to face that he 
didnt have to face as a vigorous back bencher said green who 
said he supported madigan 
madigan himself had little to say after his narrow defeat saying 
he was feeling low and didnt want to comment before the vote 94 
members had promised him their support he said and he wondered 
aloud who they were 
i dont suppose ill ever know he said

foreign contributors to the super collider must 
sign on the dotted line with specific amounts before congress agrees 
to build the 46 billion nuclear accelerator the chairman of a 
house appropriations subcomittee said wednesday 
but energy secretary james d watkins said foreign countries are 
waiting for congress to signal its own commitment to building the 
highenergy physics project in texas before they chip in 
watkins complained that its a chicken and egg situation this 
year and testified that everyone is looking for the next person 
to make the next commitment 
rep tom bevill the chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on energy and water development countered there wont 
be much incentive for other countries to participate once the united 
states takes on the commitment 
when congress agreed to spend 100 million on the super collider 
last year thats getting pretty serious thats pretty 
committed bevill dala told watkins 
bevill said congress will insist on knowing how much foreign 
countries are committed to spending on the collider before 
authorizing construction 
they are going to have to put their name on the line bevill 
said we like to talk in specific terms and congress likes to hear 
specific figures i dont like to be vague about it 
bevill has vowed not to put the super collider on the credit 
card and not to sacrifice all other important energy research to 
pay for it 
the mood of the country and the mood of congress is not too 
keen on undertaking on a project of this size bevill said if 
congress has to foot the whole bill 
the super collider will be built near waxahachie texas its 
53milelong underground tunnel will be able to accelerate protons 
with sufficient force that they will smash into each other with 20 
times the energy of todays most powerful accelerators

christian army units and druse militiamen 
fought fierce artillery duels wednesday firing up to 40 rounds a 
minute to start the third week of the worst sectarian fighting in 
the civil war since 1985 
police said they had reports of two civilians killed in christian 
east beirut and 10 people wounded there and in moslem west beirut 
that made total casualties 68 killed and 221 injured most of them 
civilians since fighting began march 8 
residents reached by telephone in the christian half of the city 
said many people were huddled in bomb shelters 
it was the worst shelling of the battle that began two days after 
gen michel aoun who commands the 20000 christians in lebanons 
army blockaded the private ports with which moslem militias finance 
their operations in the 14yearold civil war 
syrian soldiers and other moslem forces allied with them 
blockaded the 310squaremile christian enclave north and east of 
beirut for the second day sealing all five crossing points but the 
druse militia of walid jumblatt has carried the battle with aoun 
the confrontation has exacerbated a political crisis that created 
competing christian and moslem governments and split the army on 
sectarian lines 
aoun leads the christian government in addition to commanding the 
christian army maj gen sami khatib commands 22000 moslem 
soldiers who are helping the syrians blockade the christian enclave 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon and has become the countrys 
main power broker during the long civil war aoun has declared a 
war of liberation against the syrians 
on wednesday he said let syrian president hafez assad 
relinquish power that will be better for lebanon syria and the 
middle east 
he was responding to editorials by official syrian media calling 
for his own removal as a condition for ending the latest round of 
war 
its impossible for me to go back on my pledge to drive syrias 
occupation forces out of lebanon the general declared 
syrias blockade of christian lebanon leaves no room for 
peaceful coexistence any more he said they are trying to 
starve us they are trying to dismember lebanon 
his statement was broadcast by all christian radio and television 
stations while the thunder of artillery and rockets filled the city 
and the hills overlooking it 
a police spokesman said aouns command headquarters in suburban 
yarze came under heavy bombardment soon afterward 
shells and rockets are raining at the defense ministry the 
spokesman said it has taken several direct hits and damage seems 
to be great we havent received any report of casualties 
he said aoun was at the presidential palace in baabda which is a 
mile east of yarze and was not hit 
aouns command post five miles east of beirut is less than a mile 
from the residence of us ambassador john mccarthy telephone calls 
to the residence from west beirut were not answered but the police 
spokesman said it had not been hit 
the us embassy in east beiruts aukar suburb 10 miles north of 
yarze suspended consular services until further notice because of 
the fighting an embassy official said he would not let his name be 
used or give further details 
the police spokesman said the shelling came from druse militia 
positions near the mountain towns of bhamdoun aley and souk 
elgharb 
christian leaders said syrians were manning the guns but police 
would not comment on the claims 
christian army gunners struck back with sustained barrages from 
155mm howitzers aimed at aley bhamdoun and druse villages clustered 
around them said the police spokesman whose name cannot be used 
under standing rules 
they also shelled chtaura the town where syrian troops in 
lebanon have their command headquarters the spokesman said 
lebanons latest political crisis began sept 22 when parliament 
could not agree on a successor to president amin gemayel at the end 
of his sixyear term and gemayel named aoun to head an interim 
government 
moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to salim 
hoss the sunni moslem premier who led the government during 
gemayels administration 
under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from 
france in 1943 lebanons president is a christian the premier a 
sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem

a mild winter is beginning to take its toll on the northeast as 
new york citys mayor declared a water emergency wednesday and 
officials in other cities nervously eye low water levels 
homeowners can keep the hoses and sprinklers in the basement 
you cant use them said mayor edward i koch as he declared a 
drought emergency and imposed strict wateruse limits 
boston and its immediate suburbs are under a water emergency 
warning the western reservoir that supplies the area is way below 
normal and it appears restrictions will be on the way according to 
the massachusetts water resources authority 
in pennsylvania the delaware river basin commission stopped 
short of declaring a drought emergency for parts of four states as 
rain and snow fell tuesday into halfempty reservoirs in upper new 
york state 
we are 14 billion gallons from entering the drought zone 
said a pessimistic david everett the commissions chief engineer 
storms last weekend also helped raise reservoir levels but the 
commission said it would declare a drought emergency if significant 
precipitation doesnt fall in the next few days over the fourstate 
region 
at the start of spring the catskill reservoirs should have 250 
billion gallons or 92 percent of their 271 billion gallon capacity 
and by april 1 they should hold even more water instead they 
currently hold about 129 billion gallons 
an emergency declaration would restrict nonessential water use 
in new jersey and delaware and in large portions of pennsylvania and 
new york 
connecticut water supplies are 20 percent below normal in the 
stamfordnorwalk and new london areas said gary johnson who 
monitors reservoir levels for the state department of health 
services 
no restrictions have been imposed but the stamford water co has 
suggested that the city use disinfected waste water from its sewage 
treatment plant to extinguish garbage at the trash incinerator such 
a move could save 500000 gallons of potable water per day 
the scituate reservoir which serves 60 percent of rhode island 
including most of metropolitan providence is about 5 feet below 
normal levels officials there say theyre concerned but will 
wait until midapril to decide if they have an emergency 
koch forbade a long list of water uses in new york city 
including swimming pools lawn sprinklers and hydrants with spray 
caps for street play asked how new yorkers can cope with the usual 
hot and sticky days of summer koch said its going to be tough 
but were going to do it 
reservoirs that serve the city were 55 percent full wednesday 
down from the 91 percent normal at this time of year 
to the north westchester county which gets 85 percent of its 
water from the new york city system already has imposed 
restrictions lawns and gardens can only be watered every other day 
for two hours in the early morning and two hours at night swimming 
pools can only be filled once for the summer 
the main reason for the drought is a lowerthannormal rainfall 
and the failure of the normal snowcap to develop in upstate 
mountains for a spring runoff 
environmental protection commissioner harvey schultz said this 
years runoff would be the worst runoff in the 62 year history of 
the water system

a suburban virginia congressman worried about 
the district of columbias rise in drugrelated crime has drafted 
legislation to give the federal government control over the citys 
police department court and prison system 
the bill which rep stan parris rva plans to introduce when 
congress returns from easter recess would authorize president bush 
to appoint a national capital public safety director who would be 
responsible for managing the districts police and fire departments 
emergency ambulance service and corrections system for a fiveyear 
period 
the situation in the district of columbia is clearly out of 
control said mark strand a parris spokesman the problem lies 
with the leadership 
although parris plan would take control of the citys public 
safety services from mayor marion barry jr the federal government 
would not necessarily provide more money for running those programs 
the bill calls for all salary and equipment expenses to be paid by 
the city 
however strand said parris hopes his bill will work in concert 
with bush administration drug policy coordinator william j bennett 
who has said he may target the nations capital for additional 
federal antidrug funding 
parris move comes as the drugrelated crime spree in the 
nations capital has gained new attention 
last year a record 372 persons were killed in the district and 
police blame 60 percent of those killings on drugs that total and 
the highest percapital murder rate of any city in the country 
gave washington the ignominious distinction of murder capital of 
america through wednesday 119 murders had occurred in the 
district during 1989 roughly twice as many as at the same time in 
1988 
barry and others have complained that a lack of jail space has 
hampered law enforcement efforts and parris bill would allow the 
public safety director to use unappropriated city government money 
to build new prison facilities but would prohibit jails from being 
built outside the citys boundaries 
parris whose northern virginia district includes the cityrun 
lorton corrections facility is opposed to any expansion at that 
3800acre jail facility 
the citys home rule charter through which the district received 
limited selfgovernance in 1973 gives congress the authority to 
take control of any component of the city government 
neither barry nor police chief maurice t turner were immediately 
available for comment 
in recent weeks bush administration officials and congressmen 
have become increasingly concerned about washingtons crime problem 
parris proposed action is the strongest yet 
last week sen warren rudman rnh touched off a furor by 
suggesting that congress should take control of the city police 
department by establishing a federal constabulary to help slow 
the crime spree 
rudmans comments were endorsed by sen ernest hollings dsc 
who said he would cosponsor any legislation rudman proposed

officials said wednesday they were 
seeking a 39yearold arab linked to terrorist attacks in italy and 
france and a newspaper reported the man planned the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 
the hamburgbased bild newspaper said samir khadar directed the 
lockerbie attack on dec 21 from west germany it said khadar 
traveled to west germany in december to prepare for lockerbie 
and that he was in bonn the west german capital 
a federal official denied khadar was being sought in connection 
with flight 103 but said authorities are looking for him in 
connection with other terrorist attacks 
greek authorities said last year they believed khadar was killed 
in a car bombing hours before a palestinian terrorist attack on a 
cruise ship off greece in which nine people died july 11 greek 
authorities said he planned the attack 
but swedish police arrested five people last month they said were 
members of a terrorist cell headed by khadar and they said there 
were contradictory reports on his death 
the swedish police identified khadar as a palestinian member of 
the abu nidal group a radical palestinian faction and said they 
seized weapons and plastic explosives in a search of his stockholm 
home in august 
us officials also believe khadar is still alive and italy and 
sweden reportedly have issued warrants for his arrest 
the bombing of flight 103 took place over lockerbie scotland 
and killed all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground investigators 
in england have determined that a bomb hidden in a cassetterecorder 
downed the jet the new yorkbound flight originated in west germany 
and changed planes at heathrow airport in london 
bild said khadar is known as the professor of terrorists and 
also uses various aliases bilds report carried a frontpage 
photograph of a darkhaired man with a moustache whom it identifed 
as khadar 
in london the sunday express newspaper reported sunday that a 
libyan known as the professor slipped into west germany using 
the alias patel and had worked out of the iranian embassy in 
bonn 
the paper said a passenger who died on flight 103 had visited the 
libyans hotel room in bonn and may have unwittingly carried the 
bombladen cassetterecorder that downed the plane 
west german officials and british police denied that report 
alexander prechtel spokesman for the chief federal prosecutors 
office in karlsruhe told the associated press the bild report was 
just more speculation on who was responsible for the pan am 
bombing 
but prechtel said khadar is being sought as a suspect for 
attacks in italy and france and his name is known to authorities 
here he did not give details on the attack in france 
but we dont have any evidence that he was in west germany and 
there is no evidence of a link to the lockerbie attack prechtel 
said 
if he had been here he would have been arrested and extradited 
to italy or france we have very close cooperation on such 
matters prechtel added 
according to bild khadar was involved with terrorist attacks in 
rome in 1983 on the us embassy and on a jewish synagogue in which 
it said a total of 37 people died bild also said he is suspected in 
connection with the december 1985 bombing at romes airport in which 
12 people died

fawn hall oliver norths former secretary 
testified at his trial wednesday that she had few qualms about 
altering and shredding top secret documents the day before 
investigators were due because of her complete trust in him 
i worked for colonel north closely for four years she said 
he was a man whose character i knew well i knew there was a 
reason why he was doing this 
an intense but composed witness miss hall recounted the 
frenzied activity in norths white house office on nov 21 1986 
after the administration became aware that money from arms sales to 
iran had been used to aid the guerrillas fighting in nicaragua 
she said north a top aide on the national security council 
asked her to make changes in some documents brought out from the 
nscs top secret system four files the changes which he marked 
for her all involved retyping the documents with sometimes subtle 
and sometimes wholesale alterations 
i made the changes and assembled the packages and began to 
xerox them she said 
what did you do with the originals asked prosecutor john 
keker 
i shredded those and destroyed them 
why did you do that 
it was the logical thing to do she said 
asked by the prosecutor whether she had any qualms about her 
actions she said there was a moment when i paused 
questioned by the judge she said that neither north nor anyone 
else instructed her to destroy the papers 
the documents that north was having redone were six socalled 
1985 problem memos that indicated norths deep involvement in 
the contra aid efforts and knowledge of them by national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane at a time when such aid was barred by 
congress 
miss hall said she recognized that these were the documents from 
identifying numbers she said that when they were prepared a year 
before north made jokes that because of them he might have to go to 
jail for them 
if you knew colonel north well she said he had a great 
ability of relieving tension he had a great sense of humor 
the day after the shredding investigators for attorney general 
edwin meese iii came to the office she testified that she had not 
known that the investigators were coming 
miss halls testimony went directly to three of the 12 criminal 
charges on which north is being tried obstruction of congress by 
the creation of false and misleading chronologies and altering and 
destroying documents obstruction of a presidential inquiry 
altering and concealing documents 
miss hall now works for the william morris talent agency but did 
not say what she does 
on nov 25 1986 four days after the shredding incident north 
was fired from the national security council and miss hall said that 
two nsc aides came in to seal up the office 
hall said that as she went through documents in the office for 
norths successors she found minutes of former mcfarlanes meeting 
in tehran she also found notes and copies of the documents she had 
altered 
she said before she left she put the tehran minutes in one of the 
boots she was wearing and put the altered documents in the other 
boot 
it was a very stupid thing that i did that day she said 
earlier a switzerlandbased lawyer who set up dummy companies 
for the irancontra operation testified that 286 million flowed 
into the companies bank accounts between february and late october 
of 1986 
willard zucker born in brooklyn but living in geneva for 20 
years testified that he was approached in 1984 by albert hakim a 
longtime client who wanted to establish a company 
there was a project to purchase arms and munitions or both 
zucker said we were requested to facilitate payments open bank 
accounts on instructions by hakim and secord his reference was to 
richard secord a retired air force major general who sold arms to 
the contras and a north codefendant 
investigations concluded that money from sales of us arms to 
iran went through those companies to purchase covert military aid 
for the contras 
among the companies zucker set up were lake resources inc hyde 
park square corporation and energy resources international he 
testified without providing any details that distributions 
from their accounts went to ace east southern air transport and 
rafael quintero 
ace an acronym for amalgamated commercial enterprise inc was 
used as a front for the services of southern air which assisted in 
the contra resupply operation eagle aviation services and 
technology or east provided pilots and supplies to that operation 
southern air a former cia property was involved both in the contra 
resupply operation and the reagan administrations secret arms sales 
to iran quintero is a cubanamerican who helped coordinate the 
resupply effort 
zucker testified that the first three deposits totaling 10 
million were made in february around the time that national 
security adviser john m poindexter is said to have approved the 
diversion of iran arms sale money to the contras 
on may 15 the record showed another 10 million deposit the 
following day north sent poindexter a computer note saying the 
companies controlled by secord and hakim had more than 6 million 
available for immediate disbursement four days later another 5 
million went into the account 
in his congressional testimony poindexter said he believed the 
secordhakim operation was supplying the contra all of the surplus 
from the iran arms sales but later it developed that only 38 
million of a 161 million surplus had gone to the rebels 
zucker also testified about 36 million credited to hyde park 
square corporation on oct 28 he said that an iranian gentleman 
was behind that bank account 
in other trial testimony former cia employee glenn robinette 
contradicted grand jury testimony he gave two years ago 
robinette said he was trying to protect secord by covering up 
in an april 22 1987 grand jury appearance the fact that it was 
secord who paid for a 13800 security fence at norths home 
robinette testified at that time that an exchange of phony 
backdated bills and correspondence between him and north was real 
and accurate

american arms produced jointly with us allies 
were sold to countries patently unfriendly to the united states 
violating a us ban on thirdcountry sales a congressional report 
said wednesday 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm found 
that the united states had 18 coproduction agreements with six 
countries west germany greece italy japan south korea and 
switzerland and that three of those countries violated the pacts 
the gao would not release the names of the three countries which 
it said are classified but it did say that the breaches involved in 
agreements covering tanks helicopters stinger antiaircraft 
missiles and ammunition 
in several instances the arms were sold to governments that 
are patently unfriendly to the united states said the report 
which did not specify whether the nations were on the state 
departments terrorist list or provide any other description 
the state department which is responsible for handling incidents 
of noncompliance took some action on the cases the gao said 
the house armed services subcommittee on investigations released 
the report just a day after president bush decided to endorse an 
agreement in which the united states would join forces with japan to 
codevelop and coproduce the fsx an advanced version of the us 
f16 fighter 
today were talking about new agreements with some of the same 
countries that will involve the transfer of some of our best 
technology said rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of the 
subcommittee 
it seems to me that we need to reexamine this policy and only 
enter these arrangements if there are rocksolid capabilities in

among its recommendations the gao suggested that the defense 
department update its coproduction directive which was last revised 
in 1974 the directive does not contain specific rules for the 
military services or overseas security assistance organizations to 
handle the programs and ensure compliance with the agreements 
the investigation was prompted by the disclosure last year that 
south korea had overproduced and sold m16 rifles and parts to other 
countries without us consent the two nations had reached an 
agreement setting production limits and barring such sales

the fbi may withhold from public disclosure its 
rap sheets on some 24 million americans the supreme court ruled 
wednesday 
the court in a broadly worded opinion said a federal law aimed 
at curtailing government secrecy does not require the fbi or any 
other agency to release information about private citizens 
the 90 decision scuttled a freedom of information act lawsuit by 
a cbs news reporter and the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press aimed at obtaining such documents 
the 1966 law allows government agencies to withhold documents 
when disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 
writing for the court justice john paul stevens said a 
government agency supplying someone with information about private 
citizens virtually always is an unwarranted invasion of privacy 
the foias central purpose is to ensure that the governments 
activities be opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny not that 
information about private citizens that happens to be in the 
warehouse of the government be so disclosed stevens said 
the fbi maintains millions of identification records called rap 
sheets detailing arrest and conviction information supplied by 
federal state and local law enforcement agencies 
cbs correspondent robert schakne in 1978 sought all fbi records 
of the arrests indictments and court dispositions of any charges 
against four brothers two of whom later were identified by 
authorities as associates of reputed pennsylvania crime boss russell 
bufalino 
filed under the foia the request in dispute sought such 
information about charles medico one of the four brothers 
schakne said he was trying to determine if medico had a criminal 
record because the brothers firm medico industries inc had 
received lucrative defense contracts with the help of former rep 
daniel j flood dpa 
schakne said he requested the fbi files as part of his reporting 
on flood who had been charged with accepting 50000 in bribes 
flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on 
probation 
the reporters committee later filed a similar request 
a federal appeals court here rejected justice department 
arguments that such fbi records are covered by privacy exceptions in 
the foia but wednesdays ruling said the governments interpretation 
of the 1966 law is correct 
justices harry a blackmun and william j brennan said the court 
went too far in exempting all rapsheet information from foia 
disclosure 
i would leave the door open for the disclosure of rapsheet 
information in some circumstances blackmun wrote in a concurring 
opinion joined by brennan 
rep don edwards dcalif praised the ruling as a proprivacy 
decision adding it is important that the coedwards who chairs a house 
subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights said the court reaffirmed the individuals 
right to privacy in information held by the government i do not see 
this as an antifoia decision the information is still available 
to the press at the local level 
in other decisions the court 
ruled unanimously that the composition of new york citys 
powerful board of estimate violates the equalvoting rights of the 
citys more populous boroughs on the board are the mayor the city 
council president and the city comptroller with two votes apiece 
and the presidents of the citys five boroughs with one vote apiece 
expanded the sweep of federal mail fraud law as it upheld 54 
the conviction of an illinois man who sold used cars in wisconsin 
after tampering with their odometers

us civil rights commission chairman william 
barclay allen said wednesday that president bush will have to come 
to him directly if he wants him to resign 
the white house said bush has no intention of asking allen to 
quit but made clear that a replacement was being readied 
it would make no sense for me to do it resign voluntarily 
allen said in the wake of reports that bush planned to replace him 
with arthur a fletcher a moderate republican and one of bushs 
early black political supporters 
allen said he has been trying to meet with bush since the 
election but has received no response from the president or anyone 
else at the white house his term does not expire until 1992 
during the regan administration the civil rights panel was 
criticized in congress for adopting positions such as opposing 
affirmative action programs allen was appointed by former president 
ronald reagan following the death in june 1988 of the panels 
previous chairman clarence pendleton 
allen has fueled the controversy about the commission by getting 
entangled in an adoption case involving a 14yearold apache girl 
white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said there would 
be no vacancies on the commission for bush to fill until november 
hart said fletcher was an old friend of bushs and he would 
be the presidents leading candidate for an opening on the 
commission 
as for allen hart said the president has no intention of 
asking him to resign the spokesman said there had been no 
discussions at the white house yet of organizational or policy 
changes at the commission 
it is easy for the president to name a chairman from the 
sitting commissioners any time he wants allen said after 
testifying before a house appropriations subcommittee 
he said that at a commission meeting friday he suggested all the 
members resign so the president and the congress could set their own 
civil rights agenda through new appointments he said the other 
commissioners didnt agree with him so it would be meaningless for 
him to resign alone 
other commission members rebuked allen after controversy erupted 
following his televised visit feb 7 to the white mountain apache 
reservation in arizona where he was looking into a custody dispute 
involving a 14yearold indian girl 
the girl had been adopted and taken off the reservation as a 
baby her mother sued to have her returned and allen along with a 
psychologist and an nbc television crew went to the reservation to 
interview the girl 
tribal authorities were outraged calling the incident an 
invasion of their sovereignty 
in response to questioning from rep jim kolbe rariz at the 
subcommitteee hearing allen said he went to the reservation to 
gather information for the commissions study of whether tribal 
leaders and the bureau of indian affairs were protecting the civil 
rights of the indians 
he said the study has been under way since 1985 following a 
commission vote to investigate 
he said he did not know the news crew was going to be there nor 
he did expect the psychologist to try to take the girl back to her 
adoptive parents 
he said he was writing letters of apology to all concerned 
i apologized that evening to apache tribal chairman reno 
johnson as i was coming out of the county jail he said 
allen was arrested on kidnapping charges and held for questioning 
for several hours after the girls mother complained to authorities 
kolbe said he would ask for a complete investigation

the surrogate militia in israels south lebanon 
security zone reported killing three guerrillas wednesday and 
an israeli general said it showed the plo is violating its 
renunciation of terrorism 
since arafats declaration renouncing terrorism we have 
witnessed about 10 attempted incursions into israel executed by a 
variety of ploaffiliated organizations said maj gen ehud 
barak deputy chief of staff 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
publicly renounced terrorism in december and recognized israels 
right to exist the united states then opened a dialogue with the 
plo over israeli objections 
groups within the plo apparently want to show their 
constituencies that in spite of arafats declaration the action is 
still going on the general said we would be happy if the rest 
of the world would also realize that he described terrorism as 
the way a terrorist group attacks civilians settlements women 
and children and even the normal activities of the israel defense 
forces in the area it controls 
barak was addressing a delegation from an international jewish 
solidarity conference when reports of the gun battle began to arrive 
army spokesmen said the south lebanon army which helps patrol 
israels selfproclaimed zone just north of the border saw a 
guerrilla squad just over a mile west of houla a lebanese village 
about the same distance from the frontier and gave chase 
the military command said it did not know what group the 
guerrillas represented israeli sources said they probably belonged 
to the shiite moslem militia hezbollah or party of god which is 
loyal to iran and not affiliated with the plo 
according to the sources the dead guerrillas carried a copy of 
the koran a moslem prayer book kalashnikov assault rifles a 
rocketpropelled grenade launcher and maps of the area 
it was the third confrontation in 10 days in the security 
zone which varies in depth from six to 10 miles israeli forces 
killed five members of a radical plo group in encountered march 12

mayor sonny bono elected in a 
landslide despite his lack of political experience has calmed 
critics during his first year in office with long hours creative 
ideas and promotional prowess 
but the 54yearold actor and singer admits the jury is still out 
on his success as a bureaucrat 
the test wasnt winning the election he said the true 
test was getting the various groups to trust me at first everybody 
takes a shot at you tries to beat you up but there is more 
confidence now because no one is questioning my motives anymore 
bono criticized by those who called his mayoral bid a thinly 
veiled attempt to resuscitate a lagging show business career cashed 
in on his celebrity status to promote tourism and secure corporate 
sponsors for events in the financially strapped oasis 
it was the same kind of energy he used to help vault the popduo 
sonny amp cher to stardom in the 1960s 
eager to erase a 25 million budget deficit and transform palm 
springs from a golfhappy retirement community into a chic 
international travel destination bono who has kept a home in palm 
springs for 17 years works at least 60 hours a week at a job that 
pays 15000 a year 
hes lost 20 pounds but has captured a lot of good will 
my earlier views changed because he is working so hard said 
rose mihata local businesswoman and founder of a selfappointed 
city watchdog group that has clashed with bono in the past 
people from all over the world come here talking about palm 
springs because of him as a publicity man you cant beat him 
she said 
bono has appeared on several tv talk shows at international film 
festivals and in a wellpublicized east coast visit with new york 
mayor ed koch to promote the desert city 110 miles east of downtown 
los angeles 
but the same flashy celebrity profile that draws praise from some 
sparked bonos first tiff with local leaders when he requested the 
city pay for firstclass airfare for his 27yearold wife mary and 
their 11monthold son chesare when he traveled on palm springs 
business 
he withdrew the request after complaints drew national media 
coverage saying he was willing to foot the bill to avoid burnout 
and keep his marriage intact 
i give him an a for effort said former palm springs mayor 
frank bogert 79 i criticized him to beat the band before he got 
in because he didnt have any experience but hes learned real fast 
and has a lot of good ideas 
bogert affectionately called the cowboy mayor came to the 
desert outpost in 1927 with a string of horses and never left 
serving as mayor from 195866 and again from 198288 he said bonos 
risktaking and emphasis on publicity have helped palm springs break 
a tradition of staidness 
my biggest success has been the ability to bring in change that 
has been resisted for years bono said pointing to his promotion 
of annual spring break festivities and shifting the citys grand 
prix auto race from back roads to downtown streets 
other pet projects include a proposal to establish an 
international film festival in palm springs and to transform a 
downtown movie theater into a performing arts center

barely four months after a major study 
attempted to settle the issue doctors are seriously divided over 
the best treatment for many of the 12 million american heart attack 
victims who reach hospitals alive each year 
the controversy centers on whether those patients should have 
their coronary arteries examined and perhaps widened immediately 
after they get drugs to dissolve the blood clots that triggered 
their attacks 
the dispute raged this week during the american college of 
cardiologys annual meeting which included a formal debate 
wednesday 
the uproar highlights problems in conveying complex medical 
advice to the public it also reveals potential conflicts of 
interest for doctors who earn money examining arteries with a 
procedure called angiography and widening clogged arteries with 
another method named balloon angioplasty 
heart attacks can occur when a blood clot blocks part of a 
coronary artery narrowed or clogged by fatty deposits killing part 
of the heart by depriving it of enough oxygenrich blood 
about 15 million americans suffer heart attacks annually and 
about 12 million make it to the hospital alive 
doctors make pictures of clogged arteries using angiography in 
which a long thin flexible tube called a catheter is snaked into a 
coronary artery where it releases dye so doctors can make xray 
images 
during angioplasty a balloontipped catheter is snaked into a 
narrow coronary artery and the balloon is inflated to widen the 
artery then removed critics say angioplasty has been used 
excessively 
more recently drug companies developed drugs such as tpa 
tissue plasminogen activator that are injected during a heart 
attack to dissolve the clot that caused the attack up to 40 percent 
of hospitalized heart attack patients are considered candidates for 
clot dissolvers 
debate over angiography and angioplasty was sparked last november 
when doctors announced preliminary results of a study of 3262 heart 
attack patients treated in about 50 hospitals 
the study published in final form this month found that most 
heart attack patients treated within four hours with tpa and 
bloodthinning heparin and aspirin are no more likely to die or 
suffer second heart attacks within one year than those who get the 
drugs and then also quickly undergo angiograpy and angioplasty 
the study concluded that routine angiography and angioplasty are 
unnecessary in patients who get clot dissolvers unless they continue 
to have chest pain or other signs the heart isnt getting enough 
oxygen 
when the results were announced at an american heart association 
meeting last november dr j ward kennedy of the university of 
washington seattle proclaimed it settled one of the most 
important questions in modernday cardiology 
the debate at this weeks meeting suggested that the issue is far 
from settled 
dr anthony demaria president of the cardiology college said 
the findings left an oversimplified impression that if you have a 
heart attack all you need is a little thrombolytic clot 
dissolving therapy and to be tucked into bed in your community 
hospital 
thats a very inaccurate portrayal of the results replied 
dr eugene braunwald the harvard medical school professor who 
directed the study 
he said patients who got only drugs initially were watched 
carefully and 16 percent ultimately needed angiography and in many 
cases angioplasty or bypass 
before the study many doctors at major hospitals routinely 
performed angiography and angioplasty after patients got clot 
dissolvers they believed they needed to examine and widen the 
narrowed artery to reduce the chance of second heart attack or death 
dr eric topol director of cardiac catheterization at the 
university of michigan said he still believes all heart attack 
patients should have their arteries examined after they receive a 
clot dissolving drug to determine if angioplasty or surgery is 
needed 
braunwald insisted angiography isnt necessary in such 
circumstances patients who got only drugs and those who also got 
angiography and angioplasty all had death rates of only 5 percent 
after six weeks and 7 percent after one year he said 
stopping unnecessary use of angiography and angioplasty after 
clot dissolving therapy could save 450 million to more than 700 
million annually braunwald said 
harvards dr arthur weyman said there are many people who 
argue angioplasty is a very viable approach if used instead of 
clot dissolvers within two hours of a heart attack 
the trouble is that nobody has conducted a study directly 
comparing the value of clot dissolvers versus angioplasty as the 
firstline treatment for heart attack said dr frank litvack a 
critic of the study and an angioplasty expert at cedarssinai 
medical center in los angeles 
demaria said the study also left unanswered whether patients 
would benefit by getting angiography pictures of their arteries 
without the balloon procedure

iran said wednesday it rejects iraqs 
proposal for an exchange of all 100000 prisoners taken in the 
persian gulf war unless the warring armies first withdraw to the 
border 
un spokeswoman nadia younes meanwhile announced preparatory 
talks will be held before foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of 
iran and tariq aziz of iraq hold direct peace talks she said an 
iraqi delegation will come to new york on march 3031 and an 
iranian delegation will be at un headquarters april 67 
an exact date must still be set for the velayatiaziz talks 
a letter from velayati to secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar accused iraq of trying to avoid withdrawing troops to the 
border by rearranging the sequence of steps in resolution 598 the 
security councils 1987 peace plan 
the resolutions first paragraph calls for a ceasefire which 
took effect last aug 20 and withdrawal to the border the third 
paragraph calls for the exchange of all prisoners in the eightyear 
war 
president saddam hussein of iraq proposed on march 5 the 
immediate exchange of all pows outside the framework of the 
iraniraq peace talks which have been deadlocked since they opened 
in geneva on aug 25 
iran says iraqi forces still hold 1065 square miles of iranian 
territory un experts had estimated iraq held about 260 square 
miles 
the red cross registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 19284 
held by iraq but un officials and diplomats estimate the pow 
total is about 100000 
a previous agreement to exchange sick and injured prisoners broke 
down over mutual recriminations of bad faith 
iraqi diplomats say the pow exchange could proceed on the basis 
of the 1949 geneva conventions which call for immediate exchange of 
prisoners as soon as active hostilities cease 
peace talks snarled in august over iraqs desire that dredging 
begin in the shatt alarab waterway which forms the iraniraq 
southern border and is iraqs only outlet to the gulf

hundreds of schoolchildren screaming for the head of 
king louis xvi stormed a mockup of the bastille prison on wednesday 
in a reenactment of one of the french revolutions most dramatic 
moments 
dressed in period costume about 500 children from the northern 
paris suburb of st denis gathered at the place de la bastille to 
relive the event that would inflame revolutionary passions 
throughout the land 200 years ago 
giant puppets on stilts representing the king queen 
marieantoinette and revolutionary leaders danton and robespierre 
acted out their roles while the children played the impassioned mob 
blue red and white balloons sailed into the sky and confetti and 
streamers flew as the children called for a march to the bastille 
recreated in white red and blue styrofoam blocks 
when the signal was given they tore the blocks down and jumped 
into the fray 
while many children were content to watch the spectacle others 
said they knew exactly why they were there 
storming the bastille was important because thats how the 
peasants got arms explained 9yearold christophe the peasants 
were ready to revolt because they were starving they had to pay 
taxes the aristocrats didnt 
the children aged 612 spent months preparing for the event 
which was sponsored by the public schools and recreation centers of 
st denis a workingclass suburb some learned revolutionary songs 
and dances others concentrated on understanding why the revolution 
took place 
with young children all you do is to explain basic ideas like 
the abolition of privilege and slavery said danielle monteils a 
firstgrade teacher her pupils came in revolutionary costumes that 
mrs monteils and her mother made during the winter vacation 
organizers said the reenactment was important because it allowed 
some of the children to see paris for the first time 
they live in lowincome high rises and have never seen old 
buildings like the ones in this neighborhood said joelle porro 
the head of st denis 32 recreation centers many of them come 
from disadvantaged families and have few educational opportunites 
the event was one of hundreds being held throughout france this 
year to mark the 200th anniversary of the french revolution

political rivalry revenge and dreams of 
illicit drug traffic in the bayous fueled a murder scheme that ended 
in court wednesday when four men pleaded guilty to trying to kill a 
sheriff with a pipe bomb 
prosecutors said the scheme began in 1975 when duffy breaux 
defeated incumbent cyrus bobby tardo for election to sheriff of 
rural lafourche parish and climaxed with an bomb blast 10 days 
before christmas 
the explosive a homemade affair loaded with nails and bullets 
and placed in a paper bag next to breauxs car mangled the 
sheriffs left foot and also injured daniel leche a parttime 
deputy 
the four men said they plotted to kill breaux 60 to return 
tardo 58 to the sheriffs office and use it to facilitate drug 
trafficking in the coastal parish or county about 40 miles 
southwest of new orleans 
i reached an agreement with bobby tardo about 14 years ago 
and it was to have sheriff breaux killed said marshall k 
mcclendon 42 a former police officer in baton rouge and new 
orleans 
in 1979 tardo made an unsuccessful attempt to unseat breaux and 
discussed again having the sheriff killed prosecutor lance africk 
said 
breaux was tardos political enemy and tardo blamed breaux for 
personal and employmentrelated failures he suffered he said 
tardo became parish president in 1984 but lost the job in 1987 
and again decided to kill breaux africk said 
mcclendon enlisted the help of ralph j bergeron 42 a former 
policeman and john g tullier 23 a friend of mcclendons 
daughter to assemble the bomb mcclendon detonated the device 
tardo was interested in regaining political power africk said 
and mcclendon and tullier wanted to engage in drug trafficking 
in an early 1988 meeting at a sizzler restaurant the three men 
discussed the fact that tardos election could facilitate that 
result he said 
the four men pleaded guilty to conspiracy possession of an 
unregistered destructive device and damaging a law enforcement 
vehicle tardo also pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit a violent 
crime 
sentencing was set for may 31 
tardo tullier and mcclendon face separate state charges of 
attempted murder bergeron in exchange for his cooperation will

us diplomats told the plo in a 4hour 
meeting wednesday to take practical steps to ease tension in the 
israelioccupied territorites the head of the us delegation said 
in the first formal talks since president bush took office the 
two sides got down to weighty subjects in detail according to the 
leaders of the us and palestine liberation organization 
delegations 
us ambassador robert h pelletreau who headed the threeman 
american team said after the meeting that there was a new 
dynamic in the middle east of which this dialogue is a part 
pelletreau said us concerns about terrorism were discussed as 
well as practical steps that can be taken in the occupied 
territories to reduce tensions 
he did not detail those steps nor did the leader of the 
threeman plo side yasser abedrabbo indicate what the us side 
has asked of the palestinians 
abedrabbo said progress was made but he emphasized that the plo 
believes the only road to peace is an international conference 
involving the five permanent members of the un security council 
and all parties to the conflict including the plo 
in washington an official said on condition of anonymity that 
abedrabbos response to the us plea to take steps in the west 
bank was indefinite the official spoke after receiving a report 
from tunisia 
in another development rep charles e schumer dny said he 
was concerned that abedrabbo headed the delegation because he is 
secondincommand in the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine a plo faction 
the group was accused by israel last month of sending guerrillas 
on an infiltration mission despite chairman yasser arafats 
renunciation of terrorism in december the guerrillas were 
intercepted 
the us government in its terrorist group profiles described 
the dflp headed by naif hawatmeh as marxistleninist and 
prosoviet in policy it has repeatedly affirmed its hostility and 
resistance to us policy in the region and carried out bombings 
and grenade attacks against israel the document said 
the talks in suburban carthage followed a 90minute 
getacquainted session dec 16 the first announced formal meeting 
between the two sides in 13 years 
police guarded surrounding streets and rooftops 
the meeting was held amid a swirl of confusing middle east news 
one report quoted plo spokesman bassam abu sharif as saying the plo 
would accept deployment of us troops in the west bank and the gaza 
strip a us embassy official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity dismissed the report with a gesture of incredulity 
another report spoke of a twotiered usbacked israeli peace 
plan accepted by the plo including as a first step elections of 
representative palestinians in the territories 
neither issue was mentioned in the statements after wednesdays 
talks although abedrabbo reiterated the plos rejection of 
elections in the territories while they are still occupied by 
israeli troops 
the uprising in the west bank and gaza has claimed more than 400 
palestinian and 17 israeli lives since it began in december 1987 
the uprising will continue until the day the israelis 
evacuate our homeland said abedrabbo a leader of the marxist 
democratic front for the liberation of palestine one of the most 
radical factions in the plo 
the future of the west bank and the gaza strip home to 17 
million palestinians should be discussed in an international 
conference he said 
pelletreau indicated recent palestinian guerrilla raids which 
had been the subject of a number of informal contacts between him 
and plo officials were also discussed 
the plo is very aware of our very strong view on violence and 
terrorism he said 
the israelis strongly oppose washingtons discussions with the 
plo which israel considers a terrorist organization 
the united states reversed its policy of not talking to the 
guerrilla organization after arafat renounced terrorism in december 
and recognized israels right to exist 
despite the convivial atmosphere of wednesdays meeting the 
first remarks made by an unsmiling abedrabbo to pelletreau was that 
exactly one year ago the united states decided to close the plo 
information office in washington 
pelletreaus response in arabic was not heard as reporters were 
ushered from the room

a house environmental subcommittee chairman on 
wednesday praised an interior department proposal to triple the area 
of coastal barriers to be protected from federally subsidized 
development but criticized the bush administration for not pushing 
the plan 
rep gerry e studds dmass a frequent critic of the 
environmental policies of thenpresident reagan applauded the 
coastal barrier plan completed in the final days of the reagan 
adminstration calling it a very good start 
but studds chairman of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation was told by 
interior officials that the bush adminstration does not have a 
position on the recommendations and no legislation would be offered 
by the white house 
as i understand it the administration would be in a reactive 
mode reacting to whatever proposal congress comes up with said 
susan reecelamson deputy assistant interior secretary for fish and 
wildlife 
beth millemann director of the coast alliance an environmental 
lobby said after the hearing that the administrations active 
backing would be helpful but not mandatory for success this year 
i think it will go through if congress is willing to act out 
its commitment to reducing the deficit and protecting coastal 
barriers ms millemann said they dont have to depend on the 
administration to jump on this 
but studds said that there is no way on earth congress will 
expand coastal barrier protection without strong backing from the 
white house 
subcommittee aides pointed to the intense pressure developers can 
place on their local house members the legislation would affect 
nearly every coastal district from maine to texas and coastal 
barrier advocates expect a heavy lobbying push from the building and 
real estate industries 
coastal barriers are elongated narrow landforms made of sand and 
sediments that protect wetlands lagoons and salt marshes from ocean 
waves they include barrier islands barrier spits and bay barriers 
in 1982 congress and the reagan adminstration led by 
theninterior secretary james watt agreed to prohibit federal 
building subsidizes for 452834 acres of undeveloped coastal 
barriers along 666 miles of shoreline along the east coast and gulf 
of mexico 
the law bans federal expenditures on the protected lands 
including federal flood insurance disaster relief community block 
grants housing loans water and wastewater treatment grants and 
beach erosion project aid 
the idea is to discourage development of the land which is 
environmentally fragile and could pose dangers to residents while 
saving federal money 
ms reecelamson told the subcommittee that there has been no 
significant development on the already protected tracts since the 
ban on federal flood insurance took effect in 1983 
in december the reagan administration recommended adding 790884 
acres of coastal barrier lands along 423 miles of shoreline to the 
protection the proposal would save an estimated 3 billion 
according to an interior department report 
environmentalists said the interior department plan does not go 
far enough they say it should include coastal barriers on the west 
coast and great lakes and other areas on the east coast 
a 1985 government study identified more than 58 million acres of 
us coastal barriers along an estimated 2500 miles of shoreline

the house on wednesday debated legislation to 
raise the minimum wage with democrats who long have sought an 
increase praising president bush for supporting a raise but saying 
the amount he has suggested is too low 
it is the first positive sign of cooperation on this issue that 
we have seen in eight years between the white house and the 
congress said rep austin murphy dpa who managed the floor 
debate for the democrats democrats and republicans have made an 
honest effort to work out our differences 
the democraticcontrolled chamber is expected to vote on the 
measure thursday 
the legislation would raise the minimum wage from its current 
level of 335 an hour to 465 by 1992 but murphy plans to offer 
an amendment thursday scaling back the final target to 455 
that amendment drafted by murphy with the support of the house 
leadership would also tack onto the democratic bill a provision 
allowing employers to pay new entrants into the job market a 
subminimum wage for two months 
the democrats characterized those changes as a compromise 
designed to win bushs support but republicans and even a few 
conservative democrats said raising the minimum wage even to 455 
would cause significant job losses particularly among younger 
workers and fuel higher inflation 
supporters of the bill disputed those arguments saying that 
significant job losses have resulted only once after six prior 
increases in the minimum wage during the recession of the 
mid1970s and they said even an increase to 455 an hour will 
leave the minimum wage lagging behind inflation since the wage was 
last raised in 1981 
organized labor has lobbied heavily for the increase and 
reluctantly agreed to support the murphy amendment 
the republican floor manager rep william goodling rpa said 
labor had little concern for the working poor but was backing the 
increase because it hoped to create a ripple effect that would 
send other wages higher as well 
they could care less about the people we say were trying to 
help goodling said 
a socalled training wage for new hires has been demanded by bush 
but the president has insisted that employers be allowed to pay the 
subminimum for six months 
bushs proposal calls for raising the minimum wage to 425 an 
hour by 1992 and he has said he would veto any bill that either 
raised the minimum higher than 425 or did not include a sixmonth 
training wage 
i think the president ought to have more of an open mind than 
that house speaker jim wright said just before the debate which 
is to continue thursday this is a modest increase long overdue 
and one that employers can easily afford wright said of the 
democrats bill sponsored by rep augustus hawkins dcalif 
we have a president who claims to believe in a gentler kinder 
society and he threatens to veto the bill said rep william clay 
dmo who said republicans have used the same arguments almost 
verbatim in opposing increases in the minimum wage since it was 
first established in 1938 
but rep timothy j penny dminn who joined with republicans 
in urging the bush plan be adopted as a substitute for the hawkins 
bill said bush had the votes to sustain a veto he complained that 
fellow democrats after years of trying unsuccessfully to raise the 
minimum wage were not willing to accept victory when it stares us 
in the face 
the vote on the legislation is expected thursday after amendments 
are considered in addition to the murphy amendment republicans 
will be allowed to offer bushs proposal as a substitute but concede 
they do not have the votes to overcome the democratic majority 
a similar bill is pending in the senate where floor debate is 
expected in early april that measure sponsored by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass would raise the minimum wage to 465 an hour by 
1992

a century after an agriculture department scout 
found an australian beetle that saved californias citrus crop the 
government on wednesday announced an escalation of it bugvsbug 
program of biological warfare against natures pests 
the department said agreements had been reached to send american 
scientists to china and the soviet union this summer to search 
unexplored areas for natural enemies of destructive insects and 
weeds 
were raising the priority of making biocontrol a vital part of 
american food and fiber production said r dean plowman head of 
the agricultural research service 
taiwaneseborn pathologist yang shawming will go to inner 
mongolia in search of a fungus that can destroy the leafy spurge an 
aggressive weed which drives grazing cattle and horses away from 
rangeland at a cost to ranchers that he estimated at 50 million 
at the same time five agriculture department scientists will go 
to the soviet union to look for enemies of the russian wheat aphid 
a pest that was appeared in texas three years ago and has spread 
into 15 states 
working with their russian counterparts they also will try to 
find biological controls to use against grasshoppers the leafy 
spurge the russian thistle and a number of other pests 
scientists said the problems that plague farms and backyards 
alike often arose because crops brought into this country were 
frequently accompanied by pests but not by the pests natural 
enemies 
the announcement was made at a ceremony marking the first big 
victory a century ago in biological controls 
deputy agriculture secretary peter myers recalled that victory 
he said in 1888 californias citrus trees were covered by the large 
white egg sacs of the cottony cushion scale threatening the states 
fledlging citrus industry 
the usda dispatched a scout albert koebele to australia to look 
for a natural enemy of the pest he found one feeding on scale in a 
garden in north adelaide the black and orange vedalia beetle 
twentyeight of the beetles were released in california on nov 
30 1888 and the problem was under control within a year 
since then hundreds of biological control agents have been 
introduced in american agriculture sparing the environment from 
tons of chemical pesticides and saving farmers millions of dollars 
to mark the occasion an exhibition was opened to show how 
predatory beetles aggressive parasites and deadly disease organisms 
are used to keep agricultural pests in check 
william metterhouse who directs the division of plant industry 
in new jerseys agriculture department said 40 percent of americas 
economically important insects have been found abroad 
he said shade trees across this country would be infested with 
the gypsy moth a caterpillar that eats the foliage of more than 500 
tree species if it were not for nine parasites and two predators 
brought in from overseas now a virus has been developed by usda as 
a weapon against the gypsy moth myers said 
metterhouse said new jersey farmers have had to spray eggplant 
fields as often as 15 times a season to control the colorado potato 
beetle now a south american egg parasite is being introduced this 
summer and may solve the problem he said ways are being sought to 
use the parasite to control the beetle in potato and tomato fields 
too 
myers used the occasion to announce success in a 30year 10 
million battle against the alfalfa weevil the largest biological 
control effort in us history 
the campaign has put a parasitic wasp imported from europe into 
virtually every alfalfa field in the country the department said 
at one time farmers spent up to 1 billion a year on pesticides 
but the weevil was so persistent that many farmers gave up growing 
alfalfa an important forage crop now farmers need spray only one 
year in six

japan said wednesday it hopes the united states 
wont back away from an agreement for joint development of the fsx 
fighter jet 
president bush said tuesday the united states has decided to go 
ahead with the proposed fighter jet project with japan with 
certain clarifications to safeguard us technology members of 
congress expressed strong concern wednesday about his statement 
the fsx agreement is not something that should be changed and 
we want to ensure that it is not said kichiro tazawa chief of 
japans defense agency 
it is very important to proceed with a joint development by all 
means to increase reliable relationships between japan and the 
united states he told a news conference 
according to us administration and congressional sources bush 
would propose revising the agreement negotiated last year by the 
reagan administration to better protect computer source codes 
for the software that helps fly and control the plane and other 
sensitive us data 
the changes could also include a requirement that some of the 
jets advanced versions of the usmade f16 be built in the 
united states the washington sources said on condition of anonymity 
after several years of talks the two countries signed a 
memorandum of understanding in november under which mitsubishi heavy 
industries japans leading defense contractor and aircraft maker 
general dynamics would jointly develop the fsx 
bush ordered a review of the plan after us lawmakers protested 
it amounted to giving away 8 billion worth of technology that 
eventually could help japan compete effectively against the united 
states in the the global aviation market a field in which japan 
lags 
on monday japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga was called to the 
state department and briefed by secretary of state james a baker

a newlywed was found guilty of seconddegree 
murder wednesday in the honeymoon cruise death of his bride who was 
strangled and thrown overboard 
scott robin roston a 36yearold writer stood facing jurors as 
the verdict was announced in a crowded courtroom he showed no 
reaction but his mother sophia roston wept uncontrollably in a 
front row of the spectator section 
jurors in us district court who deliberated for three days 
rejected rostons defense that his wife was murdered by israeli 
agents in retaliation for a book he wrote 
the jury convicted roston on the only charge against him the 
prosecution said there was no premeditation involved in the killing 
thus precluding a firstdegree murder charge 
the prosecution charged that karen waltz roston 26 was killed 
on feb 13 1988 after a series of arguments that culminated when 
her husband strangled her on the jogging track of the cruise ship on 
which they were honeymooning 
the case came to light a year ago when the cruise ship stardancer 
returned from a threeday mexican cruise with reports that mrs 
roston had gone overboard her husband reportedly said she had been 
swept off the ship by a strong gust of wind 
roston later blamed israeli agents 
confronted with the disbelief of everyone he confronted he 
changed his story said the prosecutor assistant us attorney 
kendra mcnally he became tangled in the web of his own lies and 
he sank like a stone 
rostons attorney david kenner said roston was innocent and 
grieved more than anyone for the loss of his wife he insisted that 
israeli agents could be responsible and pointed to two israeli names 
on the passenger list 
roston who lives in santa monica is the author of nightmare 
in israel a purported expose of his arrest in israel on robbery 
charges and his subsequent confinement in a mental hospital the 
book published by vantage press sold only one copy according to 
trial testimony 
in rebuttal testimony ms mcnally produced one of the israelis 
a wedding photographer from jerusalem who said he and a colleague 
were vacationing aboard the ship after photographing the wedding of 
a friend he denied any connection to the israeli government or the 
killing

a gynecologist testified wednesday that he was 
unaware that blood that had been tested for the aids virus was 
available when he unknowingly gave a patient tainted blood that gave 
her the deadly disease 
dr terry downing said the 32yearold woman would have died 
without the transfusion during a hysterectomy but said he could 
have waited an hour until tested blood could be delivered had he 
known it existed 
the aids virus usually leads to acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome which destroys the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer 
the woman her husband and her son are suing the belle bonfils 
memorial blood center saying the blood bank failed to properly test 
its blood 
denver district judge stephen phillips issued a court order that 
the names of the family members not be disclosed 
the family said the blood bank had test kits nine days prior to 
the transfusion but failed to follow recommendations from national 
blood bank associations that urged immediate testing of blood 
supplies 
susan fisher an attorney for the blood bank said the company 
received the test kits the day the tainted blood was donated but 
said personnel had to be trained in their use before testing could 
begin on all blood supplies 
peter smith an attorney for the woman and her family said the 
prognosis for the woman was poor the evidence is she will die in 
a few years he said 
smith said the woman had sex with her husband after receiving the 
tainted blood and breastfed her baby putting both of them in 
danger 
he said the economic impact of the illness has already reached 1 
million including medical treatment for the family the loss of 
salary after the woman quit her job to be with her children and the 
husbands inability to get a promotion in another state because of 
insurance problems 
john g salmon another attorney for the woman and her family 
said records showed that 327 units of blood already had been tested 
by the time the woman had her surgery but neither the doctors nor 
the hospital were told 
michael roark a denver pathologist said the belle bonfils 
center had an abnormally high ratio of tainted blood donors with 
two out of 514 units of blood testing positive as compared with a 
national ratio of one in 400 
roark said the blood bank had ignored recommendations from the 
american association of blood banks that all blood supplies be 
tested as soon as test kits were received

drug smuggling accusations were made 
against the hidalgo county sheriff by an informant according to an 
affidavit filed in us district court here the sheriff says the 
charges are nonsense 
the affidavit contained statements from an fbi confidential 
informant who implicated sheriff brig marmolejo in aiding a drug 
smuggling operation that brought 150 tons of marijuana into the 
country from mexico 
the 13year sheriff was elected to a fourth term in november amid 
accusations from his opponent that he was tainted by dealings with 
organized crime figures 
the affidavit unsealed last week and filed monday in the us 
district court clerks office in brownsville was drafted in june 
1987 to support a request for an fbi wiretap on the telephone of 
convicted drug smuggler antonio franco 
among other charges the informant contended marmolejo allowed 
smugglers linked to reputed mexican drug lord rafael caro quintero 
to use his ranch to unload illegal drugs 
caro quintero 39 was indicted by us district court in los 
angeles for the 1985 torture and slaying of us drug agent enrique 
camarena salazar and is jailed in mexico city while investigators 
probe the slayings of camarena salazar and his mexican pilot alfredo 
zavala avelar a dea informant 
lupe gonzalez fbi special agent in mcallen where the wiretap was 
requested refused to say whether the sheriff was the target of a 
federal drug investigation based on the affidavits accusations 
marmolejo was involved with antonio franco in smuggling drugs 
into the united states the informant said in the affidavit filed 
by fbi special agent robert palacios 
palacios is in charge of a drug smuggling and money laundering 
case against franco and ricardo garza 
marmolejo acknowledged tuesday that franco and garza were 
acquaintances its my job to know people he said 
i think there were some accusations there that were more 
political than anything marmolejo said i know tony franco i 
sold him a tractor several years ago 
marmolejo said the charges may be the offspring of a vendetta 
against his operation of the sheriffs department

a federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit 
filed by three white students who claimed dartmouth college violated 
their civil rights by suspending them after an angry encounter with 
a black music professor 
their lawyers said wednesday the students may appeal tuesdays 
ruling by us district judge shane devine that the students had 
failed to prove the suspensions were racially motivated 
devine said the allegations were hollow when compared to 
cases in which courts have found evidence of racially discriminatory 
intent especially against blacks 
sean gorman associate counsel for dartmouth said the ruling 
vindicated his claim this is a public relations stunt dressed up 
as a lawsuit 
the students christopher baldwin of hinsdale ill john sutter 
of st louis and john quilhot of fort wayne ind are current or 
former staffers of the dartmouth review a conservative offcampus 
weekly newspaper that frequently clashes with campus officials 
because of its harsh lampooning of minorities women and homosexuals 
they were suspended in march 1988 after they and a fourth 
student confronted music professor william cole about a review 
article branding him and another professor dartmouths dynamic duo 
of mediocrity 
freedman spoke at a rally after the incident saying it could 
lead minority students to shun dartmouth 
devine rejected the students claim that this and other comments 
demonstrated freedmans bias against them 
though it could be inferred that freedman believed the students 
acted on racial motives in confronting cole it is not reasonable 
to infer that president freedmans motives in making his comments 
were racial that the plaintiffs race was the reason for his 
actions devine said 
the students and their supporters including republican sens 
william armstrong of colorado and gordon humphrey of new hampshire 
held a widely publicized washington news conference last summer to 
announce state and federal lawsuits 
devine noted that state superior court judge bruce mohl in a 
preliminary finding in january found no persuasive evidence to 
support the students political discrimination claim 
mohl ordered baldwin and sutter who had been suspended for 18 
months reinstated because a member of the panel that disciplined 
them had been biased against their newspaper quilhot returned after 
a sixmonth suspension 
devine said that regardless of this bias the students did not 
have a case under the racial discrimination statutes they cited 
one of the students lawyers art ruegger said wednesday that 
the students looked forward to a full hearing on the first amendment 
issue when the case resumes in the state court no hearing dates 
have been set 
dartmouth spokesman alex huppe said the three were off campus 
wednesday for semester break

the government announced a 44 million 
program wednesday to help the fruit industry through a crisis 
provoked by suspension of sales in the united states and other 
countries because of a cyanide scare 
the restrictions paralyzed the booming industry which was 
expected to earn more than 800 million from exports this year the 
united states lifted the suspension friday after five days 
finance minister hernan buchi said the main purpose is to help 
the industry normally resume its operations and to help workers 
who have been laid off 
buchi told reporters the financial cost of the suspensions in the 
united states and elsewhere had not been calculated but in the 
worst of cases would be about 400 million 
the countrys hard currency reserves at this time are strong 
enough to face that emergency he said 
included in the aid program are government purchase of at least 
part of the fruit exporters could not sell abroad which will be 
distributed to schools hospitals and charity institutions buchi 
said 
about onethird of the money will go to an emergency employment 
program for workers who lost their jobs said labor minister 
guillermo arhur who also took part in the news conference he said 
the number of workers dismissed was still small but no figures 
were available 
growers packers and exporters are to be aided in financing the 
cost of additional security to prevent another criminal action 
against fruit exports buchi said 
funds also will be used to compensate for fruit they had to 
destroy abroad and pay for an advertising campaign especially in 
the united states 
after telephoned threats prompted inspections of chilean fruit 
two grapes containing small amounts of cyanide were found in 
philadelphia chile said comnmunist terrorists were responsible 
the us food and drug administration ordered all chilean fruit 
removed from stores canada and japan took similar action 
three fda experts arrived wednesday to work with chilean 
officials on a joint plan to check fruit exported to the united 
states foreign minister hernan errazuriz said the joint effort is 
essential to regain the american consumers confidence

antiapartheid leaders 
wednesday accused police of instigating violence and supporting 
vigilante groups in fighting among black factions in natal province 
vigilante violence has flourished through both omissions and 
the active participation of the south african police said jay 
naidoo general secretary of the congress of south african trade 
unions 
his labor federation has close ties to the banned united 
democratic front south africas largest antiapartheid coalition 
it joined the udf in compiling a detailed report of the bloodletting 
which was released on wednesday 
the udf and inkatha a political organization headed by zulu 
leader mangosuthu buthelezi are the main combatants in 
blackonblack fighting that has killed more than 1000 blacks in 
the past 1 years in townships around pietermaritzburg and durban 
police have denied taking sides in the conflict 
inkatha and the udf signed a peace agreement last year but it 
has had no visible impact on the level of violence 
buthelezi and inkatha oppose apartheid but shun the 
confrontational methods used by the udf many antiapartheid groups 
call buthelezi a government collaborator for taking part in the 
black homeland system 
apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
the udf accused police of siding with inkatha by encouraging and 
taking part in attacks on udf members and by refusing to prosecute 
inkatha members 
police commissioner hennie de witt issued a statement saying all 
allegations in the report will be investigated complainants who 
refuse to make statemens to police will be subpoenaed he said 
de witt also said the labor federations role in issuing the 
report could violate a stateofemergency restriction imposed last 
year which barred the organization from a wide range of political 
activity he said an investigation of this possible violation had 
been started 
the report detailed 29 attacks that took place in november 
december and january in imbali a township outside pietermaritzburg 
it said inkatha members were responsible for 16 attacks police 
initiated three antiapartheid activists began three and seven 
were carried out by unidentified people 
it named inkatha members who were implicated repeatedly by 
residents as having participated in attacks but were never charged 
by police 
the report said residents could only conclude that police were 
acting in concert with the wrongdoers or that there were two 
separate systems of justice operating one for inkatha members and 
a completely separate system for residents not belonging to 
inkatha 
naidoo told a news conference about 10 successful prosecutions 
have come from the hundreds of killings in natal 
human rights lawyer nicholas haysom said from the top down we 
believe police have the attitude that inkatha is an ally and other 
groups are considered the enemy 
the latest issue of tribute a blackoriented monthly magazine 
quoted winnie mandela on wednesday as predicting that the government 
will free her imprisoned husband nelson mandela 70 but refuse to 
negotiate with his organization the african national congress 
mandela has been in prison for 25 years serving a life term for 
planning a sabotage campaign 
tribute quoted his wife as saying in an interview i think he 
will be released but into an atmosphere in which even his own 
organization is seen as just a band of terrorists

estonias communist party is undergoing a crisis 
of confidence because it has remained passive too long in the face 
of nationalist attacks the soviet communist party newspaper pravda 
said on wednesday 
on the one hand communist leaders are being subjected to 
massive attacks are being placed in contrast to the people the 
article said and on the other hand the leading role of the party 
itself is being questioned outright attempts are being made to 
implant the idea that its merely one more faction in the republic 
the article attacked estonian nationalists for stirring people 
up and saying whatever they want however they want it 
accused the peoples front a grassroots group that advocates 
greater estonian autonomy of becoming too embroiled in agitation 
and conflicts with the international movement which promotes the 
interests of nonestonians living in the republic 
the estonian communist party underwent a leadership change last 
year present leaders support many nationalist goals while remaining 
technically subordinate to moscow 
the estonian supreme soviet declared the republic sovereign 
in november but central authorities refused to accept the 
pronouncement 
in the latest move toward resolving their differences soviet 
officials said wednesday a new draft law would parcel out control 
over food and consumer goods production to the 15 republics but keep 
moscow in charge of most heavy industry 
yuri maslyukov a nonvoting member of the politburo and head of 
the government commission that drafted the law said republics would 
have more say on environmental issues and allocation of natural 
resources 
however the law would leave control over energy defense 
production and at least half of heavy industry the main sources of 
pollution in moscow 
the commission decided against letting republics print their own 
currencies as some economists in the baltic region proposed 
under the draft law republics could put levies on use of water 
and manpower impose fines on polluters and in extreme cases close 
factories down estonia has drafted its own version of a law on its 
economic independence that would allow the republic control over 
virtually all its industry except defense olav lugus director of 
estonias institute of economics said in a telephone interview that 
the proposed soviet law would end up giving the republic control 
over about twothirds of its industry 
republics may modify the law to a limited degree estonias 
proposed law is subject to approval by the allunion supreme soviet 
in moscow

a legislator on wednesday accused pan am of trying 
to blame the british government for ignoring warnings before flight 
103 was bombed but officials for the airline said it was not 
blaming anybody 
in another development the london tabloid the daily express said 
us military personnel diplomats and their families were warned of 
a possible terrorist hijacking against a us airline in europe on 
easter weekend 
the early thursday editions which were available wednesday 
night said the possible threat was detailed in a secret memorandum 
dated friday from the us federal aviation administration the 
papar said it was given a copy of the memorandum 
it said the memorandum named three lebanese terrorists believed 
to be traveling on forged passports 
meanwhile the furor continued over charges that transport 
secretary paul channon bungled warnings to airlines about a new type 
of bomb before flight 103 blew up 
conservative party member david wilshire whose parliamentary 
constituency includes heathrow airport said pan am was warned about 
the new radiocassette bomb by west germany and by the us 
authorities well before the dec 21 disaster over scotland 
pan ams behavior in london is an utter disgrace wilshire 
said in an interview simply by being silent they have tried to 
make the british government the fall guy for what happened it 
was pan am that let the bomb on board 
a radiocassette bomb destroyed flight 103 over the scottish 
village of lockerbie killing 270 people 
asked to comment on wilshires charges a spokesman for pan am in 
london who declined to be identified said pan am has not been 
blaming anybody 
british government officials said wednesday that prime minister 
margaret thatcher stood by channon and had no intention of firing 
him from her 22member cabinet 
britains topselling newspaper the sun which normally backs 
thatcher called for channons resignation its main rival the 
leftwing daily mirror declared in a frontpage headline youre 
still a liar mr channon and challenged him to sue 
other newspapers also rejected channons denial that he leaked to 
journalists a false report that the bomber has been traced and they 
charged him with being lax over the warnings and secretive since the 
disaster 
he has made grievous errors of judgment said the sun she 
mrs thatcher cannot protect him from charges of lethargy he 
should quit and mrs thatcher should accept his resignation 
the furor began after newspaper disclosures last week that 
channons department warned british airlines nov 22 about the new 
bomb a followup warning dated dec 19 with a photograph which was 
also addressed to pan am and other foreign airlines was not sent 
out until midjanuary 
however the federal aviation administration which is 
responsible for us airlines had warned us carriers on nov 19 
about the radiocassette bomb 
wilshire said west german authorities had also warned pan am in 
early november after members of a palestinian terrorist group were 
arrested in west germany with a model of the bomb 
channon who never told parliament about the warnings until 
newspapers found out last week maintains the dec 19 warning was 
unimportant additional notification 
the pan am spokesman refused to say when the airline including 
its london office received the early november warning from west 
germany 
last week pan ams london office announced without elaboration 
that it had received the dec 19 warning on jan 17 it made no 
mention of previous warnings 
channon maintains the bomb was put aboard at frankfurt where the 
new yorkbound flight originated but the west german authorities 
deny this 
the west german newspaper bild said wednesday a 39yearold arab 
suspected of staging terrorist attacks in italy and greece planned 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 
a west german official denied the report but said authorities are 
looking for the man samir khadar in connection with terrorist 
attacks unrelated to flight 103

a legislative committee voted 196 
wednesday night to recommend that state treasurer a james manchin 
be impeached for mismanaging an investment fund that lost 279 
million 
manchin 61 one of the most powerful political figures in west 
virginia is accused of neglect of duty incompetence 
maladministration and high crimes and misdemeanors 
the judiciary committee must vote once more on its impeachment 
resolution after it is drafted into its final form then the measure 
will be sent to the full house of delegates 
if 51 of the 100 delegates vote for impeachment the treasurer 
will be tried in the state senate where a twothirds majority is 
needed to remove him from office 
the judiciary committee also voted to have its counsel draft a 
resolution reprimanding and censuring state auditor glen gainer for 
neglect of duty 
the action stems from losses in a state investment fund most of 
which occurred between april and june 1987 manchin a democrat who 
has spent 40 years in state government was first elected state 
treasurer in 1984 
manchin was not in his office when the committee voted at 620 
pm and a family member who answered his home telephone in 
farmington said he was not home there was no answer at the home of 
his son a state lawmaker 
the elder manchin is alleged to have failed to report the losses 
or failed to properly supervise his staff manchin blames his 
employees for the losses and says he didnt learn of them until 
december 1988 
mr manchin overdelegated his responsibilities to the 
detriment of the people of west virginia by attending primarily to 
the ceremonial functions of the office he holds the impeachment 
resolution says 
it goes on to accuse him of failing to obtain an even 
conversational understanding of his own investments division 
among other shortcomings 
the committee spent more than three hours over two days on a 
linebyline review of the impeachment resolution but had no debate 
before the vote 
before endorsing the resolution the committee eliminated earlier 
references to improper solicitation of campaign contributions from 
employees or new york investment brokers 
the committee added an allegation that treasurers office 
employees and possibly manchin engaged in a conspiracy to hide the 
losses from the public and from local governments that had money 
invested in the fund 
in a separate meeting wednesday the state board of investments 
agreed to ask attorney general charlie brown for a legal opinion on 
how the board should decide what agencies should absorb the 279 
million in losses 
we may have to take the losses gov gaston caperton said 
i think practically in most cases there will be no payment 
back from local governments that were paid interest on investments 
that actually lost money

leaders of colombias medellin cartel 
were indicted wednesday on charges of cocaine trafficking and 
masterminding the slayings of the colombian justice minister and a 
us drug informant 
the sweeping indictment alleges that both nicaragua and the 
bahamas were used as way stations for 1 billion in drug imports to 
the united states among those charged is a close associate of 
bahamian prime minister lynden pindling 
the case once again shows that the united states is not going 
to let up our efforts to catch these individuals who are supplying 
drugs to the united states us attorney robert w genzman said 
we feel that the pressure has got to be kept on regardless of how 
many indictments come out in the united states against members of 
the cartel 
in all 30 people were charged in the second wave of 
indictments resulting from last mays conviction of carlos lehder 
rivas one of the leaders of the cartel which officials say is 
responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into the 
united states 
the indictment accuses cartel leader pablo escobar gaviria of 
organizing the assassination of colombian justice minister rodrigo 
lara bonilla on april 29 1984 and says escobar and fabio ochoa 
vasquez directed the feb 19 1986 slaying of former drug 
enforcement administration informant barry seal 
other major figures indicted included cartel kingpins jose 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha ochoas brother jorge ochoa vasquez and 
gonzalo mejia 
none of the cartel members has been taken into custody although 
most have already been indicted in miami they are believed to be in 
colombia officials said 
genzman noted that it took the government six years to get lehder 
to the united states i am confident that in some point in time we 
will be able to obtain custody of the others he said 
also indicted was jack carlton reed who was lehders 
codefendant at last years trial 
lehder and reed were convicted here last may 19 of conspiring to 
import cocaine lehder an unindicted coconspirator in the new 
indictment is serving a life sentence and reed is serving a 
15year term 
genzman said the indictment covers a 15year period from 1974 to 
the present and involves the importation of 44000 pounds of 
cocaine worth 1 billion 
the indictment contains 205 snapshots of a longterm drug 
conspiracy in action genzman said 
the indictment traces lehders development into a primary 
overseas transporter of cocaine for other medellin cartel members 
and his continued assocation with these members after they developed 
their own tranportation operations genzman said 
the indictment accuses escobar rodriguez mejia reed and the 
two ochoas of running a continuing criminal enterprise punishable 
by a maximum life sentence and conspiracy to import drugs 
the indictment alleges that after the slaying of bonilla in 
colombia the top cartel leaders fled colombia and eventually 
traveled to nicaragua lehder and others paid nicaraguan officials 
to allow them to stay in that country and use it as a base to 
smuggle cocaine to the united states the indictment says 
they allegedly stored 1400 kilograms of cocaine at los brasiles 
air force base in nicaragua before flying it into the united states 
the bahamian charged in the indictment everette bannister of 
nassau is charged with receiving bribes to allow the cartel to use 
the islands just off floridas shores as a way station for drug 
shipments 
nbc news citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials 
reported that an early draft of the indictment said bannister shared 
the alleged payoffs with pindling and other bahamian officials 
pindlings name was dropped from the indictment after it was 
reviewed by the justice and state departments in washington nbc 
said the network did not say whether the early draft named pindling 
as a defendant 
bannisters telephone in nassau was busy wednesday and he could 
not be reached for comment bill kalis a spokesman for pindlings 
office said the government of the bahamas would have no comment on 
the indictment 
genzman said the united states has an extradition treaty with the 
bahamas and would seek custody of bannister he refused to answer 
questions about continuing allegations that pindling himself was 
involved in the drug operation 
gorman bannister everette bannisters son is a protected 
federal witness who testified in lehders 1988 trial 
in the trial bannister characterized his father chairman of 
bahamas world airlines and a consultant to resorts international as 
an influence peddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglers 
and regularly supplied pindling with money 
in 1987 the younger bannister wearing a hood testified before 
a us senate subcommittee about drugrelated corruption in the 
bahamas 
bannister testified in lehders trial that his father took money 
from lehder and former jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smuggler 
edward hayes ward to help protect them from law enforcement efforts 
my father said he made a deal with carlos to get 100000 a 
month to make normans cay operational bannister testified in 
february 1988 referring to lehders island transshipment point in 
the bahamas about 40 miles southeast of nassau 
several witnesses in the lehder trial testified that they had 
made payoffs to high bahamian officials including pindling who has 
denied the allegations 
in 1984 the royal bahamian commission cleared pindling of any 
wrongdoing concerning allegations that he took payoffs from drug 
smugglers pindling first elected in 1967 was reelected in 1987 
aside from reed who was already in prison only five of those 
indicted wednesday were immediately arrested authorities said they 
were identified as yemel nacel of new york city who is lehders 
former wife barry kane a hyannis mass attorney jeffrey edward

the federal trustee supervising eastern airlines 
bankruptcy reorganization on wednesday appointed a 15member 
committee to represent unsecured creditors of the striketorn 
airline 
the new creditors committee includes representatives of the 
machinists union and pilots union at miamibased eastern as well as 
a representative of nonunion employees most of whom were laid off 
following the strike 
the machinists struck the airline on march 4 after 17 months of 
wrangling with management over a contract the pilots support for 
the walkout virtually grounded eastern and forced it to file for 
protection from its creditors on march 9 under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy act 
the eastern pilots are owed more than 500 million in back pay 
and other claims said ron cole a spokesman in miami for the air 
line pilots association 
the creditors committee has the right to review any 
reorganization plan proposed by eastern and can propose its own plan 
to the bankruptcy judge 
in houston officials of easterns sister carrier continental 
airlines preparing for heavy easter travel dismissed the effects of 
a flight attendants strike they said the walkout is not disturbing 
service despite union claims of delays and cancellations 
continental officials say the strike was called at the behest of 
eastern machinists both eastern and continental are owned by 
houstonbased texas air corp 
lewis jordan continentals chief operating officer and executive 
vice president provided a chart indicating the carrier has had an 
average 27 daily cancellations out of 1400 flights daily for about 
three weeks before the strike and an average of 12 cancellations 
daily on monday and tuesday 
and not one of those cancellations is as a result of a shortage 
of a flight attendant or crew member jordan said 
philip hobbs a spokesman for the flight attendants union 
however contradicted jordans statistics and insisted there have 
been numerous cancellations and delays caused by the walkout 
continental and union officials differ drastically on the number 
of attendants not reporting to work 
hobbs said between 1200 and 1300 attendants have walked off the 
job while continental said only 180 were striking 
a federal appeals court in new york meanwhile refused to let 
commuter railroad workers cripple northeast rail transit by honoring 
eastern machinists picket lines 
the unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with eastern workers 
but the appeals court refused to lift a lower courts bar on such 
strikes

parliament passed new tougher laws 
on wednesday to curb demonstrations in czechoslovakia doubling jail 
sentences for violators the official news agency ctk said 
the laws which went into effect immediately also punish people 
who circulate nonconformist texts such as petitions 
the antidemonstration measures originally were handed down feb 
14 a month after an unprecedented week of antigovernment protests 
in prague the capital the stiffened penalties were approved by the 
presidium of the national assembly or parliament by law however 
they had to be ratified by the full legislature at its current 
session 
the maximum sentence for obstructing a public official from 
carrying out his duty jumped from six months to one year in prison 
the maximum penalty for violating public order was doubled from 
three months to six months in prison and the maximum fine 
quadrupled from 500 to 2000 
the public order charge was used against dozens of people 
detained in the january protests 
the frequency of actions aimed against the public 
interest has increased recently and certain legal measures must 
be taken without delay ctk quoted parliament member vladimir 
vedra as saying wednesday 
our legal code so far does not include any measure on the basis 
of which it would be possible to punish action consisting of 
preparing a printed material which by its content damages the 
interest of state 
this appears aimed at preventing any repeat of two petitions 
signed by more than 3000 intellectuals protesting the governments 
suppression of the january protests and the arrest of dissident 
playwright vaclav havel 
ctk did not say if any deputies spoke against passage of the laws 
wednesday 
vaclav maly a member of the charter 77 human rights group said 
that members of an official human rights committee set up last 
december had indicated they opposed the stiffened penalties for 
violating public order 
maly spoke after attending a meeting at the committee last month 
between the czechoslovak organization and the international helsinki 
federation 
an official at the committee contacted after the penalties were 
approved wednesday declined comment 
the committee has come under fire from some czechoslovaks who 
accused it of failing to speak out against what they called police 
brutality used in putting down the january protests

a federal judge declared a mistrial wednesday in 
a major stockmanipulation case against gaf corp and a company aide 
after the jury said it remained deadlocked in the 12th day of 
deliberations 
it was the second mistrial in the first big trial stemming from 
the governments crackdown on wall street securities fraud the 
trial was seen as a key test of the governments ability to convict 
such defendants before a jury 
us district judge mary johnson lowe declared the mistrial 
before a stunned courtroom shortly before 3 pm she had declared a 
mistrial in the first trial after determining prosecutors had 
mishandled a key piece of evidence 
it wasnt immediately clear whether the government would seek a 
third trial of gaf and its vice chairman james t sherwin 
sherwin hugged his wife and to the question of how he felt said 
i dont really know 
gaf said in a statement after two lengthy and costly trials 
and 12 days of jury deliberation we would hope that the courts 
action today would now put an end to this case 
the company and sherwin were indicted in july for allegedly 
trying to boost the stock price of union carbide corp in 1986 
shortly before selling a large block of shares they also were 
charged with securities fraud wire fraud and conspiracy 
gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building materials 
manufacturer and its two subsidiaries faced maximum fines totaling 
12 million or 500000 on each of eight counts against each of the 
three sherwin faced 40 years in prison and a fine of up to 2 
million 
lowe declared the mistrial after the jury sent her a note that it 
was split three ways some for conviction some for acquittal and 
others uncertain lowe then asked jurors whether they thought 
further deliberations would be productive five said yes and seven 
said no 
carl loewenson the assistant us attorney who tried the case 
said it would be retried but one of his superiors bruce baird 
said the decision would be up to acting us attorney benito romano 
while the issues in this case are severely contested all 
counsel are of the view that this trial was conducted in fairness 
said stephen kaufman sherwins attorney 
arthur liman the lead gaf defense counsel told reporters we 
had hoped for an acquittal the government hoped for a conviction 
the jury wasnt able to agree so we have a sense of 
incompleteness 
liman said lawyers for both sides would meet with the judge later 
the hung jury was considered a significant setback for the 
government in its campaign against securities fraud and raised 
questions about how much effort federal prosecutors will expend on a 
case that many wall street defense lawyers have called weak 
the us attorneys office in manhattan has brought charges in 
more than 50 securities fraud cases since 1983 but nearly all the 
claims have involved civil charges criminal frauds to date 
including pending charges against drexel burnham lambert inc have 
been settled through plea bargains 
the government based its case against gaf and sherwin largely on 
the testimony of los angeles broker boyd l jefferies an admitted 
felon expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as 
part of a plea arrangement with the government 
jefferies testified that sherwin asked him to boost union 
carbides price and promosed to compensate him for any loss 
but several parts of jefferies testimony were contradicted by 
his main associate james melton who said sherwin never asked him 
personally to manipulate union carbide stock

delegates from 105 countries on 
wednesday approved a draft un treaty to control shipments of 
dangerous wastes across international borders 
the convention the first of its kind calls for keeping such 
shipments to a minimum 
the draft treaty requires all countries to provide detailed prior 
information on intended toxic shipments and to ensure that importing 
nations can handle them in an environmentally sound way 
signers pledge to forbid all transports to countries that have 
imposed a ban 
waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be kept 
to a minimum developing countries were promised technical aid 
the treaty drafted in hard bargaining over the past 18 months 
is meant to confront growing international waste traffic and fears 
about poor debtridden countries accepting shipments in lucrative 
deals 
switzerland joined by hungary launched the idea in 1983 
in a first step toward its going into effect 34 countries signed 
the convention at a final full meeting that approved the text by 
consensus the text remains open for signature 
twenty countries must formally ratify the treaty before it can go 
into force un officials have said this could take up to two years 
the united states britain and west germany were among major 
industrialized countries not signing immediately delegates were 
taking the text back for consideration by their governments 
more than a dozen industrialized countries did sign on wednesday 
including canada france italy and host switzerland hungary was 
the only soviet bloc country to sign 
wednesdays ceremony climaxed a threeday conference of senior 
officials including 50 ministers 
none of the 40 african delegations signed the convention 
several including nigeria and togo were among 11 nations who took 
part in the talks but were not at the concluding meeting 
mostafa tolba chief of the sponsoring un environment program 
said african lands are committed to the treaty and he expects their 
signatures after a policysetting summit meeting in june of the 
organization of african unity 
most waste traffic is between industrialized countries but tolba 
warned that movements between developing countries were on the verge 
of becoming a problem which god knows how we are going to 
control 
our agreement has not halted commerce in poison tolba said 
in prepared closing remarks 
but it has signaled the international resolve to eliminate the 
menace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of our shared 
environmdnt and to the health of all the worlds peoples 
he urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly and to 
observe its provisions immediately 
a statement from the greenpeace environmental group reiterated 
charges that the text merely legalizes the international waste trade 
and was weakened to please industrialized countries it again called 
for a complete ban on crossborder dangerous shipments 
a total of 42 countries more than half in africa have banned 
waste imports greenpeace said 
the convention does not explicitly cover shipments through a 
members territorial waters a point demanded earlier by many 
coastal states 
another contentious issue liability for damage from wastes was 
put off for further talks 
us delegate philip winn served notice that washington would 
oppose such talks 
new bilateral waste trade treaties with nonsigners are allowed 
but must offer at least as much protection as the un provisions 
the united nations will help monitor compliance with the accord 
a treaty review conference should be held within a year 
final approval became possible after negotiators compromised 
tuesday over lastminute third world demands for tougher language 
including greater responsibilities for wasteexporting countries and 
tighter compliance provisions 
among the 16 third world countries signing immediately were 
afghanistan bolivia colombia haiti kuwait lebanon mexico 
panama the philippines and saudi arabia 
delegates celebrated completion of the conference with champagne 
the problem was highlighted last year when tons of toxic waste 
shipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in african 
nations and when wasteladen ships traveled from port to port 
seeking permission to unload 
turkey in a statement to the conference charged the convention 
has a number of weaknesses particularly in its protection of 
waste transit countries it warned that illegal traffic will rise 
unless additional measures are taken before the treaty enters into 
force

high winds hindered efforts wednesday to 
determine whether an object on the bottom of the english channel is 
a missing container of toxic lindane insecticide officials said 
the french government also said small quantities of lindane had 
been detected in sea water and sediment samples but described the 
amounts as normal for the part of the channel near the mouth of the 
seine river 
a navy minehunting ship found a sonor echo tuesday of what 
appeared to be a metallic box of the right size in a trough on the 
channel floor in about 400 feet of water but was unable to deploy 
its unmanned minisub with television camera to get a closer look at 
the object 
the container was one of 14 aboard the indonesian ship perintis 
which sank march 13 in a storm 35 miles northwest of guernsey in the 
channel islands 
eight containers holding miscellaneous cargo are believed to have 
gone down with the ship the container with six tons of lindane was 
recovered with five others by the french navy but it was lost while 
being towed to cherbourg when ropes snapped 
lindane is widely used as an insecticide by farmers and 
gardeners and small amounts routinely wash off into rivers and 
streams to be carried to the sea large amounts however can kill 
fish 
environmentalists have said the six tons of lindane in the 
container could cause an ecological catastrophe if the toxic 
chemical leaked into the sea water 
the navy sent its ships back out wednesday to try to identify the 
container and if possible raise it but by late afternoon there were 
no reports of progress in high seas and heavy winds 
on the one hand one must verify that this is in fact a 
container and on the other be sure that it is the one filled with 
lindane that is being sought the french governments 
interministerial mission on the sea said in a statement 
the mission which coordinates efforts by several government 
ministries dealing with fishing and oceans said analysis of water 
and sediment samples found eight nanograms of lindane per liter a 
nanogram is onebillionth of a gram 
it said this was the permanent concentration under the 
european limit observed in the bay of the seine

former death row inmate randall dale adams said 
wednesday that he wants to go home to ohio and never return to 
texas the state that imprisoned him for 12 years for a crime he 
says he didnt commit 
however adams who was released from a dallas prison on tuesday 
said he isnt bitter about the past and believes a new trial on 
charges of killing a police officer would further clear his name 
shortly after his release adams flew to houston to meet with his 
attorney and sipped his first beer since his arrest in 1976 a treat 
from the planes captain he drank only one beer 
ill be glad to get back to ohio he said no offense but 
i hate texas 
later speaking to about 60 reporters at a news conference he 
softened that assessment and said he held no grudge 
i do believe texas is a good state i do believe the people of 
dallas are probably good people adams said i do not blame the 
people of dallas or the people of texas for the actions of a few 
asked whether he would ever return to texas he said i am 
going home to ohio i will stay there 
adams who had no previous arrests was convicted in 1977 of 
killing police officer robert wood and was sentenced to death he 
once came within three days of his execution date and the sentence 
was commuted to life in prison in 1980 
the conviction was dismissed earlier this month following 
revelations in a movie documentary about his case thin blue 
line 
despite being imprisoned and facing the death penalty adams said 
the texas judicial system in my case worked texas did not execute 
me 
adams welcomed news that officials were seeking to retry him for 
woods slaying saying he believed his longmaintained innocence 
could at last be proved 
ive been asking for that a new trial for 12 years adams 
said i would like to have a jury in dallas release me i believe 
my name has been cleared now but i believe that if the retrial 
happens we may be able to receive some answers as to why all of 
this happened and i would like that 
dallas county district attorney john vance said he will decide 
within two weeks whether to retry adams crucial to the decision he 
said is investigators ability to find two key witnesses 
police are trying to locate a louisiana man who had identified 
adams the mans initial testimony has not been impeached but at a 
later federal hearing the man said he did not remember his 
testimony vance said 
the second witness is a woman authorities have not contacted in 
13 years he said vance said he did not recall the witnesses names 
or other details 
adams case gained national attention when questions about his 
conviction were raised in thin blue line director errol morris 
said he was proud very proud to have prompted renewed interest 
in the case 
morris documentary questioned the testimony of then16yearold 
david harris of vidor texas who had picked up adams the day of the 
shooting after adams car ran out of gas 
wood was killed after stopping a car for a traffic violation 
adams has said harris dropped him off before the shooting occurred 
during adams trial harris was the states key witness but the 
film showed harris recanting his accusations as well as other 
witnesses reporting information that conflicted with their 
testimony harris all but confessed to the shooting and is on death 
row for another slaying 
the texas court of criminal appeals ruled march 1 that adams did 
not receive a fair trial based on the witnesses lying on the stand 
and supressed evidence from the dallas county district attorneys 
office 
while adams visited with his attorney celebration plans were in 
the works for him later this week in grove city ohio where his 
mother mildred decorated her trailer in yellow ribbons 
therell be a bunch of people to meet him at the airport 
mrs adams said then the familys just going to bring him home 
and order pizza and talk and cry for a while and just be glad hes 
home and then a lot of church people are wanting to have a coming 
home party probably a potluck

to substantiate a miracle natural logic says the 
evidence must be so overwhelming that any possibilities of it being 
wrong would be more miraculous than the miracle itself 
this theory of l8thcentury scottish philosopher david hume 
insisting that historians must reject as erroneous what is not 
possible in nature would preclude proof of the resurrection 
celebrated by christians this sunday that event didnt occur 
within natural laws 
british atheist philosopher anthony flew contends we have no 
alternative but to continue in the presumption that anything that is 
naturally impossible did not happen 
however church historian gary habermas says it is an 
unjustified assumption that whatever occurs in the world must 
automatically be a natural event this is to beg the very 
question that we seek to answer 
the differences were aired in a debate between flew and habermas 
about the resurrection did jesus rise from dead issued in a 
new paperback by harper amp row 
flew says his major point is that we simply have not got enough 
evidence to reconstruct what happened thenyou need better 
evidence 
since the event is naturally impossible he says we should 
demand evidence of a much higher order than we demand when it is an 
everyday event 
habermas of liberty university in lynchburg va says we do 
have enough facts to know 
he says that even if you utilize only the facts that critics 
admit you have enough of a basis to say that the eyewitnesses saw 
jesus the earliest eyewitnesses were absolutely convinced they 
had seen the risen jesus 
the arguments have persisted through the centuries although it 
generally is conceded that something powerfully influential occurred 
at that time to spur the sudden and rapid rise of christianity 
but challenges to the resurrection have gone on from the 
beginning including the biblically recorded bribing of the guards 
at jesus tomb to claim his followers stole the body 
that notion however involves an insurmountable problem of how 
such a robbery of a closely guarded tomb could have been executed 
and also contradicts character and motivation 
the frightened disciples hiding in despair and fear of the 
authorities were hardly in shape to plan a daring fraud nor would 
it have revived their courage and confidence as occurred 
it also would require their readiness to die for a lie which 
doesnt make sense 
various other naturalistic attempts to explain away the event 
most of them dating back to ancient times have been largely 
discredited including 
the swoon theory that jesus wasnt entirely dead that he 
revived in the tomb and mangaged to get out however a wounded 
nearcadaver could hardly move the heavy sealed stone door nor 
afterward give the impression of a triumphant conqueror of death 
the hallucination theory that jesus postresurrection 
appearances were psychologically induced visions such 
hallucinations stem from intense expectancy but the disciples were 
broken utterly defeated men 
furthermore pschologists find that hallucinations are individual 
occurrences seen only by one person at a time while the 
resurrection appearances of jesus often were to groups 
in the debate flew agreed the naturalistic theories were not 
reasonable in the circumstances but maintained the accounts of the 
event were recorded too long afterward to be reliable 
the earliest written accounts were 10 to 20 years after the 
event and flew says that is enough time to permit the forces that 
corrupt testimony to do irrecoverable damage 
who knows what they claimed at the time he said however 
about the resurrection he added i suppose they claimed something 
of this sort yes i would expect it 
as others have done habermas points out that many accounts in 
ancient history were recorded much longer after the events 
described 30 to 60 years afterward and are accepted as reliable 
he cites numerous evidences of the resurrection but concentrates 
on a passage by paul in first corinthians 1538 written as early 
as 10 years afterward but including an earlier already formed 
creed 
it was trasnmitted orally to paul who recorded the creed after 
he received it about three to eight years after the crucifixion 
habermas says paul received this creed from the apostles which 
makes it even earlier and a creed has to be repeated before it 
becomes stylized 
it lists jesus appearances to cephas peter then to the 12 
then to more than 500 then to james then again to all the 
apostles and finally to paul several other appearances over 40 
days are recorded 
its the eyewitnesses that transmitted this information 
habermas says its not hearsay 
asked if he thought the disciples including paul intentionally 
lied about it flew said oh gosh noi believe that they had 
some sort of experience

policy by the us immigration and naturalization service of 
detaining central american refugees at the texas border until asylum 
applications are processed 
they previously were allowed to join relatives or friends 
elsewhere while awaiting the results now theyre kept in tents and 
most sent back 
the rev arie brouwer general secretary of the national council

members of the us lutheranroman 
catholic dialogue team say they expect to complete work on the topic 
of one mediator the saints and mary by september but its 
going to be difficult 
many catholics invoke mary and the saints to intercede with god 
while lutherans generally regard that practice as contrary to the 
view of christ as the only intercessor 
the lutheran cochair the rev h george anderson president of 
luther college in decorah iowa says that as we have to decide 
what points of view will get into the final document the tension 
gets higher 
the catholic cochair archbishop francis stafford of denver 
says that lutherans must realize that our theology and practice of 
invocation of the saints does not in our mind and tradition 
compromise the unique mediation of jesus but rather enhances it

living off the land has been a way of life 
for generations in costilla county the most impoverished in 
colorado where jobs are scarce and lowpaying and the san luis 
valley teems with game 
we used to own these mountains all the way from fort garland 
to new mexico the people had the freedom to go and hunt for a 
living and fish and get wood its been here for 150 years or 
more said jerry sanchez of chama 
that came to an abrupt end march 6 when 275 heavily armed 
federal and state wildlife off by planes and 
helicopters swarmed through the valley before dawn in a raid 
capping a 2year poaching investigation 
i woke up and thought it was an invasion maybe of aliens or 
ricers supportedussians recalled sanchez then i found out it was 
our 
government 
us attorney mike norton who coordinated the raid said the 
tactics were to protect agents we will not tolerate the theft of 
the publics wildlife resources we will use every available legal 
means to stop this activity 
agents swept through such small towns as san luis chama and fort 
garland in colorado and costilla questa amalia and mora in new 
mexico by the time they were doning poaching said sanchez its against 
the law and people should be penalized its the way they handled 
the situation the tactics they used the guerrilla tactics were 
not bad people here 
the operation was completely out of proportion said county 
coroner charles mondragon an eighthgeneration resident of the 
valley the county was terrorized because of the actions of a 
handful of poachers he said 
older citizens on isolated farms were terrified by armed men 
crawling across their fields with militarytype uniforms on 
said san luis town trustee augustin jaramillo 
many of those arrested are claiming entrapment saying they would 
not have violated the game laws if the government hadnt created a 
market some said they were openly encouraged by morgan to kill 
wild game and eagles 
galen buterbaugh regional director of the us fish and wildlife 
service said the agent bought only enough to get evidence for each 
case 
robert espinoza a former deputy sheriff was cited with 33 
counts of game violations he was indicted march 17 on federal 
felonies of conspiracy wire fraud illegal sale of bald and golden 
eagles talons and an elk head 
one animal will prove you guilty said one suspect who spoke 
on condition of anonymity they didnt have to go and have someone 
literally slaughter 20 30 maybe 40 eagles to come out and try to 
prove the point that the guy is a poacher it just takes one eagle 
to lock a guy behind bars 
the san luis town council asked gov roy romer to investigate 
the extreme measures wildlife agents defeated their cause by 
creating a market for the purchase of wildlife from unsuspecting 
victims of entrapment it said 
romer appointed a fourmember state commission to investigate 
and us rep bill richardson dnm asked the house oversight and 
investigations subcommittee to look into the methods used in the 
raid 
romer was told of the raid beforehand but said i did not know 
there was going to be that kind of force concentrated in one place 
he has refused to judge the way the raid was carried out but 
said i am sensitive to the reactions of a community to that 
degree of intrusion into their lives that degree of presence its 
a frightening experience

housing activity is expected to take a severe hit 
this year from higher interest rates but one important category 
could be an exception remodeling activity could increase 
in fact say some housing people it is conceivable that any 
difficulty in selling new or used homes might actually spur 
remodeling activity 
that theory is based on the assumptions that existing homeowners 
with plans to move to more expensive homes might remodel instead of 
moving and that new buyers might opt for less expensive fixup 
properties 
in short while remodeling might seem costly it still might be 
less so than expenses involved in moving household goods obtaining 
a new mortgage with points attached and paying legal and other 
closing costs 
those factors could explain the high degree of optimism found in 
a survey of remodelers conducted by the national association of home 
builders 
of 2000 remodelers surveyed 78 percent said they expected 
dollar volume to rise this year and 62 percent of respondents said 
they expected the dollar increases to total 11 percent or more over 
1988 which was a record year 
for the first time in any year money spent on home remodeling in 
1988 exceeded 100 billion compared with half that in 1983 
uninterrupted increases since 1984 have made it the fastest growing 
segment of construction 
the survey underscores what many people already know that 
kitchens baths and room additions are the most popular remodeling 
jobs room additions alone accounted for 255 percent of activity 
with total rehabilitation accounting for 79 percent 
for what they are worth the median cost half above half below 
was 6700 for a bathroom 15000 for a kitchen 30000 for a new 
room 40000 for a secondstory addition and 44285 for a complete 
remodeling job 
the practical use of such figures however is limited to 
establishing a sense of relative values because the cost of any 
remodeling job is affected by particular characteristics and even 
more so by geographical area 
whatever use the figures are put to anybody who undertakes a 
remodeling job should be aware that the initial estimate is not 
always the final one it is almost a rule of remodeling that any 
improvement reveals more to be made 
while the remodelers surveyed during the final quarter of 1988 
expressed tremendous confidence for 1989 they nevertheless cited 
several problems sixtysix percent griped about low bidding by 
competitors 
kenneth klein a tulsa remodeler and chairman of the nahb 
remodelors council contends the industry is plagued by contractors 
who run a remodeling business out of the back of a truck and are 
unlicensed and uninsured 
because they have almost no overhead costs such contractors 
often are able to submit the lowest bids but says klein they also 
present the consumer with the least assurance that the job will be 
completed satisfactorily 
while such competition was cited most frequently several other 
problems were mentioned including a lack of skilled labor and the 
high cost of it the high price of liability insurance and weak 
local economies 
but considering the potentially beneficent consequences of the 
lastnamed problem it might be in the remodelers best interests 
not to complain too loudly

bille august claims he is not 
superstitious but the danish director admits that while filming the 
awardwinning pelle the conquerer he was persecuted by good luck 
during six months of shooting storms appeared on cue and 
freakish weather added just the right touch of ice to the baltic sea 
for a critical scene 
pelle is up for an oscar as best foreign film and swedish 
star max von sydow is nominated for best actor in the 61st annual 
academy awards to be announced march 29 
though the movie captured the golden palm at cannes for best film 
and won an american golden globe august is ambivalent about such 
honors 
i respect the value of awards but it feels odd to be competing 
with other filmmakers id rather just be a colleague he said 
before the oscar nominations august generated hollywoods 
interest with last years twist and shout a film about danish 
teenagers in the 1960s offers for new pictures came in but he 
said he didnt care for the manuscripts or the conditions 
then he read the house of the spirits by isabel allende a 
san franciscobased author the book traces 70 years of history in 
her native chile 
other studios were chasing allende to sell the movie rights but 
she held them off unconvinced that her story of hatred fears and 
loves could be transformed into a movie 
august said he practically forced her to watch pelle which 
he had just put in the can 
she was reserved after the screening and would make no 
decision so i took my film and went home disappointed he said 
in an interview the next day allende called him and said he was the 
only director she wanted to film her book the warner bros project 
will be filmed in argentina in english 
it is very exciting for me august said american studios 
have the capacity for larger projects and nearly an endless pool of 
good screen actors whereas in scandinavia the number of good screen 
actors is limited 
in the united states there are good technicians economic 
resources and distribution is unbelievably effective 
august never looks beyond his current project i am monogamous 
to the project im working on and dont flirt with future ideas 
he said now i am being true to the house of the spirits 
good fortune seemed to pursue the shooting of pelle the 
conquerer martin andersen nexoes 1906 novel about swedish 
immigrants in denmark shot on the baltic island of bornholm 
when a 60yearold fisherman heard that the opening scene ships 
sailing through dense fog was scheduled for oct 8 his birthday 
he reassured the director that as far back as he could recall there 
had always been a storm on that date as if on order the storm that 
hit bornholm that day was preceeded by thick fog 
three days before the crew was to film pelle escaping from his 
tormentors by hopping across a cluster of ice floes the baltic was 
totally free of ice temperatures suddenly plunged and froze the sea 
into solid ice then an onshore wind the evening before shooting 
activated a warm current that created the perfect floes on which the 
boy made his escape 
august says the harder you work the luckier you get it is the 
directors job to anticipate problems with the crew weather to 
figure out how actors will react on that day he said only when 
every detail is in place can you begin to experiment 
the title role was played by pelle hvenegaard who was chosen 
from among 3000 boys although he is danish his lines at the start 
of the movie are in a southern swedish dialect which he learned from 
a tutor 
nonscandinavian audiences will miss the transition from swedish 
to danish but august believes it doesnt matter pelle has 
universal international qualities emotions that can be understood 
by all he said 
but i think its a mistake to make international films to 
polish them down until they are neutered a film needs identity the 
best ive seen have this element he said 
working with von sydow a veteran of 40 foreign films who played 
in some of ingmar bergmans best pictures was one of the greatest 
experiences of his directing career august said

there arent many bands who have made charlie 
chaplin cry and brigitte bardot laugh but then there arent many 
bands that sound like the gipsy kings 
their music is a fiery blend of flamenco jazz and latin sounds 
driven by a halfdozen guitars their lyrics are sung in gitane a 
mixture of spanish french and gypsy 
its not the usual top 40 fare yet the band from the south of 
france international stars in europe has broken onto the us 
charts with their catchy bamboleo 
its funny to see in billboard that were in different 
categories each time said chico bouchikhi speaking through an 
interpreter nobody knows where to place us 
the music isnt the only thing thats different about this band 
the groups six guitar players are all related brothers nicolas and 
andre reyes are joined by their brotherinlaw bouchikhi and three 
cousins diego paco and tonino baliardo 
a family is able to live work do music and have fun together 
its better to have it that way said bouchikhi speaking just 
prior to the bands appearances this month on saturday night 
live and the tonight show starring johnny carson 
the band has played together for the past 16 years crossing 
barriers of language music and geography as their career slowly 
progressed they started out playing street corners and cafes for 
change where they quickly attracted an impressive coterie of fans 
one of their first boosters was the legendary comic charlie 
chaplin they met the little tramp while playing on the streets of 
towns in switzerland and he became their biggest fan weeping as the 
gypsies played their traditional songs 
it was a very very strong moment for the band because he 
cried as he listened to the music said bouchikhi it was very 
strong to realize that someone who had made the whole world laugh 
for so long could cry to our music 
and what about bardot 
we met by chance about 10 years ago when we received an offer 
to play for one of her birthday parties bouchikhi said it went 
really well and everybody was dancing and happy so we became 
friends she was kind of a godmother for the group 
the gipsy kings repaid her friendship by recording a song about 
bardot titled in english woman 
language has never been a problem for the group as they moved 
around the world bamboleo and its followup djobi djoba 
were huge hits 
emotion and passion do not need language really and thats the 
most important language really bouchikhi said words to us are 
not secondary but not that important its a general feeling of the 
music 
and despite the growing success the band doesnt want to become 
too successful the idea of the gipsy kings headlining at giants 
stadium doesnt hold much appeal for the group bouchikhi said 
whats important is to keep the idea of a big party some kind 
of joy and emotion he said and if youre playing to too many 
in a group its kind of difficult to keep the emotion together 
you have to keep some kind of balance its pretty easy to lose 
yourself while going up and up and up 
to prevent that group members rejoin their friends and relatives 
each year in an 80trailer caravan in arles france for an annual 
gypsy festival it is a time for the band to renew its family ties 
and relax 
we need to come back its very important to have the time to 
be together again before going out and traveling again said 
bouchikhi so we try to spend a lot of time in france

one democrat calls it trickledown 
republicanism another warns of the mcdonaldization of 
american politics which is a mouthful 
their message is the same the assumption that democrats can 
count on remaining a powerful party out of power is shortsighted 
politics after losing four out of five presidential elections the 
party could see the trend trickle down and threaten democratic 
dominance in congress too 
sen bob graham of florida used the mcdonalds analogy he said 
people are getting political messges the same way they hear about 
hamburger chains on television graham said that goes double for 
people who move from one state to another with the sun belt trend 
taking most of them toward republican areas 
in that situation he said the notion that there can be two 
democratic parties one of presidential losers and the other of 
congressional winners is one that cant last forever 
william a galston a university of maryland political scientist 
and an adviser to former vice president walter f mondale in the 
landslide democratic defeat of 1984 supplied the theory of 
trickledown gop strength 
he said that is more likely than a permanent splitlevel 
realignment in which theres a congressional party and a 
presidential party galston pointed to texas as an example of what 
could happen nationally rising republican strength beginning at 
the presidential level and gradually spreading down the ballot 
galston said that could well turn out to be the harbinger of 
our partys national fate it would have to be a very early 
harbinger democrats dominate the house 258 to 174 whatever the 
pull of party the power of incumbency is greater and the 
overwhelming majority of members who run for reelection win it so 
any significant change in political alignment probably would take 
years 
in the senate democratic 55 to 45 change could come more 
rapidly not in the next election but possibly in 1992 according to 
galston 
those arguments got a sympathetic hearing at the democratic 
leadership council a moderatetoconservative counterforce to the 
partys liberal wing the prevailing view there is that democrats 
must move to the middle in order to field a presidential candidate 
who can win 
when that group met recently in philadelphia sen sam nunn of 
georgia the chairman said some democrats find solace for national 
defeat in congressional dominance 
but a congressional majority cannot set the nations agenda 
only a president can do that nunn said until we regain the 
white house we will be able to block modify and amend but not to 
challenge inspire and lead 
we will be the mechanics of national policy but not the 
architects of national purpose he said 
nunn also said it was nothing personal i have no plans nor 
any inclination to run for president in 1992 
galston warned that the continuation of presidential failure 
will relentlessly threaten every bastion we still possess 
he said reapportionment will shift 18 house seats in 1992 and 
most of them will move from democratic to republican states galston 
said republican candidates won nearly twothirds of the open seats 
contests with no incumbent running the last time reapportionment 
took effect in a presidential election year it could well happen 
again he said 
galston said the democratic outlook is riskier in the senate in 
1992 suggesting that a weak presidential ticket could cost the 
party the control it regained from republicans in 1986 the terms of 
20 democrats and 14 republicans will expire with the 1992 elections 
eleven of the democrats are freshmen first elected in 1986 five of 
them by razor margins 
nor is the democratic outlook promising in 1992 electoral votes 
he said galston figures that reapportionment will add 12 electoral 
votes to states that have become the republican base in presidential 
elections bringing the strength of those states to 231 of the 270 
electoral votes it takes to elect a president 
unless the democrats have policies and a nominee who can compete 
everywhere and crack that gop base galston said the odds against 
them will be overwhelming in poker terms 
the republican nominee would start with two pairs while his 
democratic counterpart would be drawing to an inside straight

when hollywood honors 1988s best at the 61st 
annual academy awards two filmmakers hope to become the first 
asianamerican women to ever win an oscar 
who killed vincent chin directed by christine choy and 
produced by renee tajima has been nominated for the best 
documentary feature award at ceremony on march 29 in los angeles 
it is the story of chin a 27yearold chineseamerican who was 
killed with a baseball bat by an unemployed auto worker and his 
stepson outside a topless bar in detroit mich on june 19 1982 
the killing occurred following a barroom brawl in which the 
former auto worker ronald ebens blamed the loss of his job at a 
chrysler plant on japanese car imports ebens and his stepson 
michael nitz thought chin was japanese 
they were charged with seconddegree murder ebens pleaded guilty 
to the lesser charge of manslaughter and nitz pleaded no contest 
both were sentenced to three years probation and fined 3750 
wayne county circuit court judge charles kaufman said putting 
them in prison would not do any good for them or society noting 
that they had no previous criminal records the judge said the 
defendants werent the kind of people you sent to jail 
when i first read about the story in a new york newspaper 
there was no question in my mind that it was a racist case said 
choy a shanghaiborn korean who came to the united states in 1965 
i decided to make a documentary about it because i wanted to 
find out what really happened to vincent chin and tell the american 
public the truth about the case 
with a 175000 grant from the corporation for public 
broadcasting choy began the movie project in 1984 she was joined 
by tajima 30 a harvard universityeducated thirdgeneration 
japanese 
choy 36 a selftaught filmmaker had made 15 documentaries and 
features by the time she launched who killed vincent chin she 
is now a professor of cinema and television at new york university 
as the two dug into the case with cameras and microphones they 
sought to use their medium to convey their belief that asians are 
the least understood and most abused ethnic group in the united 
states 
the killers pleas and sentences triggered waves of protests from 
asianamerican groups and civil rights activists ebens and nitz got 
away with murder they felt because the victim was an asian 
in the documentary chins mother lily whose english is 
limited keeps saying i want justice i want justice for my 
son ebens readily admits the killing attributing the incident to 
unfortunate timing and too much drinking but he flatly denies 
harboring racist sentiments 
under pressure from civil rights groups ebens and nitz were 
retried and convicted in federal court in 1984 on charges of 
violating chins civil rights and were sentenced to 25 years in 
prison but the verdict was overturned on appeal because of legal 
errors they were tried again at the us district court in 
cincinnati and acquitted on may 1 1987 
with the question of chins civil rights violation out of the 
way ebens and nitz became essentially free men as kaufmans initial 
sentence of three years probation took effect 
in july 1987 however ebens agreed to pay up to 15 million to 
the victims estate james brescoll attorney for chins mother 
said ebens must pay 200 a month for the next two years and 25 
percent of his takehome pay thereafter to lily chin the agreement 
was reached after a jury had been chosen to hear a wrongful death 
lawsuit 
choy and tajima pursued the case for more than four years 
looking into the economic and sociological background of the 
slaying they interviewed all those involved including ebens 
witnesses and members of communities divided by the incident the 
entire story is told in their words without a narrator 
as the case dragged on the people who supported us at first 
departed leaving only two of us in the end choy said they 
apparently felt discouraged choy often had to operate the camera 
and microphone herself while tajima conducted interviews they 
finished the film in march 1988 nearly a year after ebens and nitz 
went free 
i was surprised at the outcome of the case not guilty choy 
said but she was careful not to mix her own personal feelings with 
her work as the director of the documentary she said the 
filmmakers think they have been fair to both sides 
we have put an equal amount of time energy and thoughts into 
both sides tajima said i think we were fair in presenting 
them 
the documentary received positive reviews from critics it was 
shown at the 17th annual new directorsnew films festival at the 
museum of modern art in new york and won the best documentary award 
at the hawaii international film festival last year 
asked about their chances of winning an oscar tajima said 
competition would be stiff but the nomination has already 
generated tremendous publicity for their film if not money 
tajima said 
who killed vincent chin will be broadcast by pbs in late 
july

not so long ago you could rob a 
bank and fly down to rio chances were good the authorities back 
home couldnt lay a hand on you 
not any longer 
thats because of stricter immigration laws extradition 
treaties more troops along the borders and increased cooperation 
with international police networks 
every crook in the book thinks he can come here and lie low in 
the jungle geovani azevedo spokesman for the federal police 
said that is not the case 
in the 1950s and 1960s brazil was getting an average of six 
foreign fugitives a year 
they included three celebrated americans benjack cage convicted 
of insurance fraud in texas earl belle the pittsburgh whiz 
kid a financial manipulator and lowell birrell sought by us 
federal authorities for stock fraud 
cage who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in texas and fled 
while his case was on appeal is still in brazil because officials 
say he automatically became a citizen by becoming the father of a 
child born in brazil he lives in sao paulo brazils financial 
center 
a variety of circumstances forced belle and birrell back to the 
united states belle to be sentenced in new jersey in 1964 to 2 
years in prison and birrell to two years after a trial in new york 
in 1970 
but before they returned they had lived openly and traveled 
freely about rio de janeiro because the united states had no formal 
extradition treaty with brazil 
in addition to cage another who is still here is ronald biggs a 
perpetrator of britains great train robbery in 1963 he came to 
rio de janeiro in 1965 after escaping from prison in england 
britain has no extradition treaty with brazil 
fugitives kept coming from other lands and some flaunted it 
mario firmenich an argentine leftist guerrilla leader of the 
late 1970s and early 1980s wanted on homicide and kidnapping 
charges smilingly posed for pictures on rios copacabana beach 
the mafia chief tommaso buscetta arrived in 1981 and set up a 
large riobased cocaine network 
something had to be done said luis fernando eichenburg 
brazils deputy justice minister we had a real circus on our 
hands 
so in 1981 brazil reformed its laws to stop foreigners from 
exchanging tourist visas for permanent ones almost overnight in 
1986 it ordered a nationwide reregistration of foreigners a 
crackdown on illegal aliens and an increased military presence along 
remote jungle borders near suspected drug routes 
in addition brazil signed extradition treaties with 16 major 
countries and numerous reciprocity agreements it also computerized 
its criminal records system and paid pastdue bills to rejoin 
interpol the international police network in 1986 
since 1983 262 fugitives 13 last year were extradited to the 
united states france italy portugal greece argentina and west 
germany said edson de oliveira brazils interpol chief 
but catching outlaws here is not easy 
brazil is larger than the 48 contiguous united states and borders 
10 nations its frontier stretches more than 9745 miles much of it 
dense uninhabitable rain forest 
criminals cross the border simply by walking through the jungle 
or using small planes that land on illegal airstrips de oliveira 
said 
since the new laws went into effect firmenich has been 
extradited to argentina and buscetta to italy both now are behind 
bars 
the most recent fugitive of note was taiwans tung kuei sen who 
was wanted in california for the 1984 slaying of a chineseamerican 
journalist and for trafficking 660 pounds of heroin he was arrested 
here in 1986 shipped back to the united states he was sentenced may 
11 in redwood city calif to a term of 27 years to life in prison 
although the 58yearold train robber biggs remains in brazil he 
has no official documents and cannot legally hold a job marry or 
leave rio de janeiro but he appears frequently in the local news 
media and even is said to be a partner in a copacabana nightclub he 
gets fan mail and has a pool to swim in a garden and a twostory 
150000 house in the hills overlooking rio 
the only thing saving me is that britain doesnt have an 
extradition treaty with brazil biggs said reently im letting 
it ride what have i got to lose

quirks of history calendars the sun and the 
moon put the timing of religious holidays this spring into a 
higgledypiggledy pattern 
such variations are not unusual both for christians and jews but 
this time theyre particularly marked 
while protestants and roman catholics observe easter this sunday 
the event it commemorates happened at the start of the jewish 
passover but passover this year doesnt begin until weeks later on 
april 20 
along with that historical disjunction eastern orthodox 
christians dont observe easter until april 30 more than a month 
after the celebration by catholic and protestant fellow believers 
the dichotomies have troubled the religious world for centuries 
sometimes occasioning keen conflict attempts have long been made 
for a common solution but with scant effect 
the complications seem about as knotty as calendars themselves 
never precisely adjustable to sun and seasons always a wee bit off 
its pointless to ask for rational explanations for deeply held 
transcendantal matters that go beyond reason says rabbi wolfe 
kelman chief executive of conservative rabbis religious 
sensitivities are involved 
in any case without the complex calculations and charts used 
including astronomical data no ordinary believer or clergy for 
that matter would be able to determine when the movable feasts 
are to be dated 
it seems almost without rhyme or reason whenever these cases 
come up remarked nikki stephanopoulos information director for 
the greek orthodox church in the americas 
regarding the frequent chronological detachments of easter from 
its origins at passover time even though jesus last supper with 
his apostles was a passover seder kelman said 
we work from three different calendars 
while both christian easters sometimes come simultaneously as 
they will in 1990 and 1991 for the last two times in this century 
and while they often mesh with passover its by coincidence rather 
than system 
religiously jews use the old lunar calendar of 354day years 
occasionally adding a leap month to keep in step with the 
seasons as was done this year 
western churches use the gregorian solar calendar of 3652425day 
years a bit short promulgated by pope gregory xiiil in 1582 
while eastern churches use a modified julian solar calendar of 
36525day years a bit long 
both calendars necessitate an extra day every fourth leap year to 
keep close to right both eastern and western wings of christianity 
have similar but slightly varying provisions about the timing of 
easter 
western churches stipulate that easter always is on sunday after 
the first full moon that occurs on or after the spring equinox on 
march 21 which means easter must be not earlier than march 22 or 
later than april 25 
to calculate in advance just when the holiday will be requires 
use of the golden number to find when full moons occur after the 
spring equinox and of a dominical letter code to determine the 
date of the particular sunday 
eastern churches like the western churches specify that easter 
should be on the sunday following the first full moon after the 
vernal equinox but add this provision it must always be after the 
start of the jewish passover 
orthodoxy says that added provision was included in directives 
set down by early undivided christianity at the council of nicaea in 
324 ad although there is some ambiguity about the matter 
in either case the golden number used to calculate full 
moons for determining both eastertimes is based on a 19year cycle 
devised in rome in 526 ad by a scythian monk dionysius exiguus 
he is the same monk that got the calendar mixed up in figuring 
the time of christs birth set as the start of the modern era 
scholarship has determined he actually was born five or six years 
bc before christ rather than in 1 ad anno dominiyear of the 
lord 
neverthless most christians including the bulk of eastern 
orthodoxy in the united states now celebrate christmas on a fixed 
date dec 25 coopted from a roman pagan festival by fourth century 
christians 
they hadnt celebrated christmas at all during their first three 
centuries 
that day is celebrated on jan 6 by some small eastern branches 
in this country by russian orthodoxy in the soviet union and by 
some middle east churches based on an ancient egyptian calendar 
however the actual month and day of his birth remains unknown

americans are consuming a record amount of 
wheat but there will be enough to go around even if poor weather 
conditions in parts of the great plains cut this years harvest by 
half 
that doesnt apply to export orders which normally run at least 
50 percent larger than domestic food use exports so to speak are 
the bread and butter of the us wheat farmer 
the agriculture department is scheduled to issue its first 
forecast of the 1989 winter wheat crop on may 11 and since winter 
wheat makes up about threefourths of the us total the forecast 
will bear heavily on this years harvest fortunes 
much attention has been focused on kansas the leading wheat 
producer where the crop has done poorly since it was planted last 
fall under parched soil conditions last year the state produced 
323 million bushels about 18 percent of the us harvest of 181 
billion bushels 
according to usda figures about 106 billion bushels will be 
used domestically in the 198889 marketing year which runs through 
may 31 of that a record 730 million bushels will be used as food 
with the balance used for livestock feed and seed 
exports are estimated at 15 billion bushels more than double 
this years food use of wheat but the 730 million bushels for 
domestic consumption is up from 719 million bushels in 198788 and 
696 million bushels in 198687 
joy harwood of the departments economic research service says 
the us consumption of wheat flour is the greatest on a per capita 
basis since the early 1950s 
this phenomenon provides a sharp contrast to the declining 
flour consumption levels recorded in the 1960s and early 1970s 
she said it is also one of the first reversals in flour 
consumption in the developed world 
harwood said in the current issue of farmline magazine that the 
concerns of american consumers about health have contributed 
significantly to the rise in per capita flour consumption nearly 
twothirds of those who participated in a usda survey said they had 
made diet changes in 1985 and 1986 for health reasons 
moreover consumers increasingly recognize fiber bran and 
whole grains as cancer inhibitors she said 
as grain consumption increases benefits also go to those who 
produce wheat products harwood said that wheat accounts for more 
than 80 percent of the total grain intake of american consumers 
department records showed that per capita flour consumption in 
1929 averaged 177 pounds a decade later in 1939 it had dropped to 
158 pounds by 1949 consumption was 136 pounds and then dropped to 
120 pounds in 1959 
per capita flour consumption in 1969 was 112 pounds on the 
average and then slipped to a low of 110 pounds in 1972 before 
edging back up to 117 pounds in 1979 
harwood said per capita consumption of flour was 128 pounds in 
1987 the year spotlighted in her study 
in 1987 she said americans spent more than 50 billion on 
retail bakery products pasta and other grain products that was up 
from 35 billion in 1980 
strong demand has meant growth for many companies in the flour 
mill and baking industries growth in size not in numbers 
the number of plants in each industry has been slashed as 
smaller companies close their doors or sell out to larger 
interests harwood said but total milling and baking output is 
higher suggesting large increases in production per plant 
harwood said the acquisitions and consolidations have not blurred 
the distinction between the milling and baking industries 
the milling industry is more national in scope while the 
baking industry is regional because baked products tend to be 
perishable she said and because of overcapacity and the need 
for frequent deliveries baking companies have expanded their 
holdings primarily through the acquisition of other baking 
companies while milling companies are frequently expanding 
individual plant capacities 
wheat is not simply wheat hard wheat both fall and 
springplanted are used mainly for breads and rolls and to a 
lesser extent in the production of sweet goods and allpurpose 
flour harwood said 
soft wheats go into sweet goods cakes cookies crackers and 
prepared mixes and some wheats are used mostly for foods not found 
in bakeries she said durum wheat for example is used almost 
solely to make pastas 
hard wheats are produced largely in the great plains states of 
kansas oklahoma texas nebraska and the dakotas soft wheats are 
grown in wideranging areas east of kansas while durum is primarily 
produced in north dakota white wheat is grown in the pacific 
northwest 
in 1987 the top 12 companies controlled about 84 percent of the 
total milling capacity for hard soft whole wheat and durum up 
from 68 percent held by the top 12 in 1973 harwood said 
the top four conagra adm cargill and pillsbury controlled 
nearly 52 percent of the nations flour mill capacity in 1987 up 
from 34 percent in 1973 and the trend has continued including 
conagras 1988 acquisition of international multifoods giving 
conagra more than 21 percent of the total capacity 
about 2700 baking plants were in operation in 1982 harwood 
said more than 2300 of these specialized in bread and cake items 
while the remainder produced cookies and crackers 
since bread and cake items have shorter shelf lives than cookies 
and crackers these are generally more local in character and are 
often single plants operated by families with fewer than 20 
employees 
but there are exceptions and larger multipleunit bakeries 
turning out bread and cake products have developed regional and 
sometimes national markets she said 
the big cookieandcracker companies have fewer plants and more 
national focus harwood said nabisco for example has at least 15 
percent of its annual sales from each us geographic region

slaves of new york 
 
the film production team of ismail merchant and james ivory has 
specialized in literary adaptations creating such cinematic jewels 
as a room with a view maurice and the bostonians all 
three movies had their bases in works with rich backdrops and meaty 
characters 
now theyve used their production and directorial skills in 
trying to turn a hunk of coal into a diamond unfortunately 
slaves of new york doesnt glitter its still a rough dark 
lump 
slaves of new york is also a meandering melange of 
superficialities it was written by tama janowitz who also wrote 
the book of short stories from which it was adapted both are 
shallow works there is no flesh and not even an interesting 
skeleton upon which to fashion a story that will grab us inspire 
us make us feel something or just entertain us 
the action such as it is takes place in the selfabsorbed and 
limited downtown art world an environment that works hard at 
causing narcolepsy 
eleanor bernadette peters a copyreader at an east village 
newspaper is an artsy type she designs outrageous hats she also 
is massively insecure and doesnt think she measures up to her 
bohemian friends she lives with a pseudoartist named stash adam 
coleman howard who dots the world with all those cookie cutter 
cartoons and graffitilike drawings the downtown world calls art 
the miserably highstrung stash is having an affair with daria 
madeleine potter whos having an affair with marley nick corri 
slaves of new york is bernadette peters first movie role 
since 1981s pennies from heaven since then shes gone on to 
greater glory on broadway receiving a tony award from her 
performance as dot in stephen sondheims sunday in the park with 
george and starring in song and dance and into the woods 
she is terribly miscast in slaves of new york and her 
talents largely go unused 
mary beth hurt is wonderful as an acidic art dealer but we see 
too little of her ditto tammy grimes as georgette 
ivorys direction lacks heart he just doesnt seem to like what 
hes doing or even understand it but then again janowitz hasnt 
given him very much material too much of the movie seems like guess 
work and hence incomplete 
slaves of new york was produced by ismail merchant and gary 
hendler and is released by tristar pictures this film is rated r

moon over parador mca home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg13 
 
the farce moon over parador is better than it seems at first 
but its nowhere near as good as it could be with paul mazursky as 
director and actors richard dreyfuss sonia braga and raul julia 
its a little like tootsie goes bananas 
dreyfuss who puts in a very good performance plays an ambitious 
actor in search of a really meaty role he inadvertently finds it 
when he is kidnapped to fill in when the dictator of a caribbean 
country parador where hed been at work on a film dies julia is 
the evil police chief the power behind the power braga who had 
been the dictators mistress takes dreyfuss on and gets him to do 
some good in her country 
but underneath it all the movie is about acting and entertaining 
jonathan winters fernando rey sammy davis jr ed asner dick 
cavett and ike pappas make appearances julias character educated 
at harvard university talks about wayne newton and lou grant and is 
fascinated with acting and movie making 
in parador dreyfuss character gets a copy of the sunday new 
york times and reads about acting opportunities dreyfuss and braga 
perform for an applauding crowd of paradorans at a beach by 
smooching as dictator dreyfuss recreates a scene in which the real 
dictator visited the shooting of a film in parador and mazursky 
himself appears crossdressing as the late dictators mother 
and finally when dreyfuss leaves parador to return to the new 
york city acting scene he left he bids farewell to braga in what he 
exclaims to be a moment right out of casablanca 
but for all the attention to acting many of the lines leave much 
to be desired and simply fall flat when the dictator passes out 
drunk julia looks at him and says he cant drink anymore his 
liver is totally damaged 
still there is much in the movie that is witty and fun

a summer to remember mca home video vhsbeta 3995 rated 
pg 
 
a summer to remember does have tess harper a cute orangutan 
and a couple of kids who triumph over adults but it is so syrupy 
that its hard to swallow 
the film directed by robert lewis is about a deaf boy sean 
gerlis who feels isolated and extremely angry after his dad leaves 
him and his mother harper and sister his stepfather james 
farentino tries desperately to reach him and break him from his 
shell 
but what it takes to bring him out is an unlikely relationship he 
and his sister develop with an escaped ape who has been trained to 
speak in sign language its a clever idea and the acting is fine 
also in the cast are louise fletcher burt young and bridgette 
andersen 
the movie deals well with the difficulties that can develop 
between a stepfather and stepson and with the way the world can 
seem to a deaf boy 
but it hits the audience over the head with its good intentions 
especially heavyhanded are the music and and a slowmotion scene in 
which the kids tumble in a field with their orangutan pal

american college and university students 
will be taking part in a new exchange program one that places them 
in temporary jobs in japan 
students from the university of massachusetts and possibly a 
dozen other schools throughout the northeast will work for three 
months to a year in japanese companies after a little training in 
patience humility and japanese etiquette the programs founder 
said tuesday 
the difficulty with americans is getting them to fit in 
reading the japanese mind said larry j rosenberg of the 
international programs office at the universitys amherst campus 
knowing the language is almost secondary 
the university signed a contract with the japanese employment 
agency selnate on march 13 in what officials said might be the first 
agreement of its kind the agency specializes in foreign recruiting 
said new york representative john watanabe 
watanabe said the agency and the school acting as a 
clearinghouse hope to place 30 students from several colleges in 
research public relations editing and other jobs in the programs 
first year university officials are meeting with representatives of 
interested schools on march 31 
the students must be working toward a degree to be eligible and 
must have at least four semesters of japanese language classes said 
rosenberg and joan stoia of the universitys cooperative education 
program 
its a very different culture and when you get off the plane 
unless you can read japanese you are immediately illiterate 
stoia said 
the university does not grant academic credit for cooperative 
education but students will be paid and may be housed by the 
companies rosenberg said he said however that the students 
should expect only to break even on the deal because of the high 
cost of living in tokyo and other cities 
well tell them where to find restaurants where they can get a 
meal for 4 he said theyll learn to take subways and live in 
small quarters in a company dormitory but thats another window on 
how it is to work for a japanese company 
the goal is what rosenberg termed the internationalizing of often 
insular japanese companies that are recognizing the need for western 
innovation and flexibility 
several companies have already lined up for students including 
hitachi mitsubishi electric fuji electric sanwa research 
institute and japan paper and pulp he said 
the companies will pay selnate an asyetundetermined fee for 
each student the employment agency will in turn give the university 
a percentage to cover the programs costs 
the exchange will involve some education on both sides rosenberg 
said 
for some of these companies this will be the first foreign 
employee theyve had and theyre nervous he said the japanese

federal employees who blow the whistle on 
government waste fraud and abuse would get added job protection 
under legislation passed by congress and sent to president bush 
we have a bill that provides strong protection for those who 
expose wrong occurring in the federal domain rep frank horton 
rny said tuesday as the house approved the senatepassed measure 
on a voice vote 
bush is expected to sign the bill a revamped version of 
legislation vetoed by president reagan last tall it won 970 senate 
approval on thursday 
the bill would provide increased protection from firing and 
demotion for federal employees who disclose mismanagement and waste 
in the agencies where they work 
employees fighting for their jobs would face less stringent 
standards of proof that their firing or demotion came as the result 
of whistleblowing 
the office of the special counsel established eight years ago to 
investigate civil service abuses would become an independent 
agency it now is an arm of the merit systems protection board and 
has come under criticism in congress on grounds that it has done 
little to assist whistleblowers 
whistleblowers would be able to take their cases directly to the 
board if the special counsel did not act within 120 days but the 
special counsel would not be allowed to file lawsuits in court on 
behalf of employees a key change from last years version 
reagan pocket vetoed last years version saying it would have 
resulted in federal agencies fighting court battles against each 
other a president may allow a bill to die when congress is not 
sitting simply by refusing to sign it 
a freshly minted compromise between the bush administration sen 
carl levin dmich and other senate sponsors dropped last years 
provision allowing the special counsel to go to court that answered 
reagans objection and the justice department immediately announced 
that the measure now had administration support 
the bill is the second major piece of legislation sent to bush in 
this congressional session it follows a measure that blocked large 
pay raises for top federal employees the only other bills passed so 
far this year established a federal employees recognition week and a 
greek recognition day 
added job protection for whistleblowers has concerned congress 
since 1969 when pentagon aide a ernest fitzgerald was fired for 
exposing 2 billion in cost overruns on the c5a cargo plane 
project he was reinstated after a 13year battle 
eight years ago lawmakers approved civil service machinery 
designed to protect whistleblowers from retaliation by their 
bureaucratic bosses by most accounts however it has failed to 
work the special counsel has been largely ineffectual says 
levin chief senate sponsor of the current bill 
gao studies have shown the special counsel has done little to 
help whistleblowers indeed 25 percent of federal employees 
surveyed by the merit systems protection board in 1983 said they 
knew of waste fraud or abuse in the government but 70 percent of 
those who knew of it said they would under no circumstances disclose 
it 
the only way youre going to find out about it is if people on 
the inside talk to us said pat schroeder dcolo the message 
in this bill is that we want a watchdog we want a watchdog for the 
taxpayer

bankamerica corp in the latest indication 
of the bank holding companys financial recovery has taken an 
option to buy back a 50 percent stake in its world headquarters 
complex 
the company however insisted that an immediate purchase is not 
imminent 
what we are acquiring is an option not a building it will be 
several years in the future before we decide whether or not to 
exercise the option a spokesman said 
bankamerica would not disclose how long the option was good for 
how much the bank paid for the right to buy back half its 
headquarters or how much the complex is worth 
in financial difficulties in 1985 bankamerica sold its complex 
including its distinctive 52story office tower for about 660 
million at the time it was considered the largest realestate 
transaction in the nation 
now our circumstances have changed the building is unique and 
san francisco is our headquarters city the spokesman said 
the complex built in 1969 also includes two other buildings and 
has a total of 18 million square feet of rentable office space 
buying back half the headquarters could be less expensive for 
bankamerica than continuing to lease the space it now occupies 
bankamerica a major tenant in the complex curently has about 3000 
employees working there 
bankamerica sold its headquarters to help stem increasing losses 
losses however continued despite the sale of more than 1 billion 
worth of bankamerica properties including its 50 percent interest 
in arco plaza in los angeles the companys san diego headquarters 
and its new york operations center 
but in the past year the companys financial health has 
improved and bankamerica posted a record profit of 726 million for 
1988

president bush is trying to counter complaints 
that a joint usjapanese fighter plane project is a hightech 
giveaway by promising tight restrictions on the computer technology 
involved 
bush said tuesday that he has decided to endorse the joint 
venture to produce the fsx fighter plane but with changes in 
the agreement to safeguard us technology 
bush said he will send congress a modified version of the 
agreement struck last year by the reagan administration with japan 
to build the plane a new version of the americanmade f16 
the project has come under fire on capitol hill and even with 
the administration assurances some lawmakers remain skeptical 
efforts to keep a lid on sensitive us technology could prove 
almost impossible once the project gets under way said charles 
smith an aide to sen alan dixon dill a chief opponent of the 
fsx project 
how do you keep data away from them we would like to see how 
the deal is structured he said 
among the changes being sought by bush according to 
administration and congressional sources are tight restrictions on 
computer source codes for the software used to fly and control 
the plane and a requirement that some of the fighters be made in the 
united states 
a formal decision by bush was expected within the next few days 
white house aides said but the president announced his general 
support for the project on tuesday 
weve pretty much finished our deliberations here inside the 
administration he said ive made my decision to go forward 
with certain clarifications on the 1988 agreement 
the changes would also give the commerce department an expanded 
role to monitor the project and keep track of japanese compliance 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
although the modifications will include a requirement that a 
proportion of the planes be built in the united states they will 
not go as far as the 40 percent level reportedly proposed by 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher sources said 
japan however still wants the original agreement to stand 
the japanese government strongly hopes this agreement would be 
implemented said shingo yamagami a spokesman for the japanese 
embassy 
marlin fitzwater bushs press secretary said aspects of the 
decision to seek changes already had been discussed with the 
japanese government 
were interested in their review of some of the suggestions 
weve made and some of the options weve laid out fitzwater said 
the reagan administration negotiated the arrangement after japan 
refused to buy f16s and indicated it would build its own jet 
fighters the new fsx plane would be built jointly by general 
dynamics and japans mitsubishi heavy industries 
backers of the project within the administration argued that it 
should go ahead to avoid damaging usjapanese relations but 
skeptics including mosbacher argued that the technology transfer 
could work to the disadvantage of us industry particularly if the 
japanese used the advanced technology in building other aircraft 
under the proposed restrictions on computer source codes the 
technology would be shared with the japanese for the fsx project 
but in such a way that the data could not be used on other 
enterprises 
the codes are used to change or expand the software that supply 
the fighters computer with information on how to control the plane 
and its weapons restrictions on the codes were not part of the 
original agreement

a judges decision giving apple computer 
inc an important initial victory in its lawsuit against microsoft 
corp and hewlettpackard co actually clears the way for a prompt 
vindication of microsofts rights the computer software publisher 
said tuesday 
on friday us district judge william schwarzer in san francisco 
refused microsofts request to throw out the suit and scheduled a 
hearing april 14 on what could be a lengthy copyright battle 
but in microsofts first comment on what it termed phase i of 
the case a company executive praised portions of the judges 
decision 
while the lawsuit has not affected the way we do business it 
will be good for both the industry and microsoft to have these 
issues resolved once and for all william h neukom microsoft 
vice president for law and corporate affairs said tuesday in a news 
release 
schwarzer ruled a 1985 applemicrosoft licensing agreement did 
not entitle microsoft to produce a computer display program called 
windows 203 the subject of apples copyright suit over visual 
displays for apple macintosh computers 
schwarzers ruling means microsoft cannot claim permission from 
apple to market a program with visual displays similar to those in 
the macintosh apples biggestselling model apple says 
both microsoft and hewlettpackard which uses the windows 
display for a computer program called new wave contend apples 
program was not original but derived from other companies works 
if apple prevails in its suit it could have wideranging impact 
on the personal computer industry microsoft windows works on 
international business machines corps equipment and a ruling 
protecting apples userfriendly displays could keep similar 
programs off ibmcompatible computers 
schwarzer refused microsofts request for a summary judgment 
dismissing the suit in seeking that ruling microsoft had argued 
the 1985 licensing agreement which allowed an early version of the 
display program called windows 10 was broad enough to cover the 
later version of windows 
microsoft declined immediate comment following schwarzers 
ruling saying it would wait to see the written version however 
apple officials quickly claimed victory 
microsofts position has been weakened said apple 
spokeswoman carleen levasseur 
everybody initially sort of poohpoohed this thing as not being 
important analyst john mccarthy of forrester research inc said 
friday now its becoming clear that apple has a potentially valid 
legal case 
microsofts stock fell 475 a share friday to 4650 it was 
unchanged monday but rebounded tuesday to 4987 a share apple was 
unchanged tuesday at 3487 
neukom however said schwarzers written order monday granted 
microsofts motion for summary judgment to the extent that the court 
determines the 1985 agreement licenses microsoft to use the visual 
displays in windows 10 
we are extremely pleased that the court has upheld the validity 
and relevance of the 1985 settlement agreement and interprets the 
meaning of the license in a way that is consistent with our 
position he said 
we intend to prove that the visual displays in windows 203 can 
be traced to the visual displays in the six products named in the 
license microsoft innovation or expressions in the public domain 
we have not infringed any apple copyright

american airlines today announced one of the 
biggest aircraft orders in history a doublebarreled 
multibilliondollar deal for up to 150 dutch fokker 100 shorthaul 
planes and 35 boeing jetliners 
the purchases announced by americans senior executives at a new 
york news conference signaled the latest push by one of the nations 
biggest commercial carriers to modernize its sprawling fleet through 
the 1990s over the last two months american has gone on an aircraft 
shopping spree exceeding 10 billion 
robert crandall americans chairman and president said the 
shorthaul fokkers would enable the company to retire older boeing 
727s and replacing aging british aerospace planes used primarily for 
flights of less than 1000 miles 
american has placed firm orders for 75 fokkers and options for 
another 75 in a deal potentially worth 309 billion 
the boeing order is for 25 757200s and 10 767300er aircraft 
crandall would not disclose the value of the contract for the 
boeing 757s and 767s but analysts and industry sources estimated 
the value at 18 billion to 21 billion the latest boeing 
acquisition will bring americans total orders of these aircraft to 
85 firm and 85 options 
american also said it had placed orders with rolls royce for 238 
engines valued at up to 17 billion to power the fokkers and 757s 
the 767s will be powered by general electric engines the airline 
said 
there had been minor speculation american also would announce a 
purchase of planes from strikecrippled eastern airlines now in 
bankruptcy protection from creditors eastern recently put 
narrowbody planes in its 250aircraft fleet up for sale the notice 
to aircraft brokers included listings of dc9s boeing 727s and 
boeing 757s 
during todays news conference crandall also left open the 
possibility that american might consider bidding on easterns 
northeast shuttle operation which was recently returned to the 
auction block after real estate developer donald trump lowered his 
offering price 
im not sure im interested crandall said im not 
interested in any price ive seen quoted so far 
americans new fokkers are twinengine jets which seat about 100 
people each for the dutch aircraft company the deal represents a 
major breakthrough into the us market 
last month american announced a deal with mcdonnell douglas 
corp to buy eight longrange md11 widebody jetliners with options 
for another 42 in that accord american also took options on 100 
md80s a smaller plane designed to replace the boeing 727 
analysts placed the value of the mcdonnell douglas deal at about 
7 billion 
based in fort worth texas american is the nations 
secondlargest airline with a fleet of 478 planes that already is 
one of the youngest in the industry at an average of about 94 years 
the carrier plans to reduce the average to around 84 years by 
1992 with a fleet of more than 600 planes by 1991

texas air corp officials say a strike by 
continental airlines flight attendants has fizzled and they are 
dismissing calls by eastern airlines labor unions for a boycott of 
both carriers as a fantasy 
flight attendants for the strikedevastated eastern airlines the 
aflcio and two consumer groups announced the boycott plan tuesday 
in miami 
texas air spokesman art kent today called the very idea of a 
boycott ridiculous 
its hard to comment on a boycott that doesnt exist said 
kent whose corporation owns eastern and continental 
mary jane barry president of a transport workers union local 
representing eastern flight attendants was joined by 
representatives of the florida consumer federation the florida 
state council of senior citizens and the aflcio of florida which 
said it would run radio ads urging the boycott 
we will be asking all good americans to stand up to frank 
lorenzo by refusing to fly eastern and continental ms barry said 
lorenzo chairman of houstonbased texas air has been accused by 
unions of stripping eastern of its assets to benefit continental 
easterns 8500member machinists union representing mechanics 
and baggage handlers went on strike in a contract dispute on march 
4 most of easterns pilots and flight attendants have refused to 
cross picket lines the airline is flying only about 100 flights a 
day 10 percent its prestrike level 
eastern which has asked for bankruptcy reorganization has 
invited representatives of unions and noncontract employees to be 
on a creditors committee to be formed today in new york 
wally haber a machinists official in miami said the company was 
asking for union representation to make it look like they have 
warm blood and a heart and i dont think thats true 
continental officials meanwhile dismissed claims by its flight 
attendants that their walkout which began monday by the union of 
flight attendants was hampering flight schedules 
the socalled strike has had absolutely no effect on our 
operations insisted airline continental chairman d joseph corr 
not a single flight cancellation has resulted from ufa activity 
union officials however said they were having a growing impact 
on continental operations and that the airline was hiding the 
effects of the strike 
continental officials said 2 percent or 130 of 6500 flight 
attendants had taken to the picket lines while a spokesman for the 
union said 1075 stayed off the job 
the airline said it has plenty of flight attendants to fill in 
should more decide to honor the strike but ufa spokesman charlie 
sampson contended that continental had exhausted its reserves and 
was calling on other company employees to fill in 
at houstons intercontinental airport continentals main hub 
the union reported 132 pickets tuesday but tina ceppi with the 
houston department of aviation said only 15 to 20 pickets were 
present no continental pickets were reported at hobby airport the 
citys other major airport 
the continental flight attendants say they are striking to 
protest wages of 11000 to 15000 a year which they say are 30 
percent to 50 percent below those at other carriers union members 
also deny claims by continental that a recent wage and benefit 
increase has brought those wages up to par in the industry 
continentals attendants have been working without a contract 
since the company reorganized under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act in 1983 the company says only 5 percent of its 
attendants belong to the union the union says 60 percent are 
members

the federal aviation administration did not 
publicly report 26 million in civil fines levied against some 
airlines including one as large as 800000 a washingtonbased 
newsletter reports 
the faa didnt announce 16 fines of more than 25000 each levied 
over the past five years according to the corporate crime reporter 
the largest was an 800000 fine levied against united air lines 
in august 1988 also not reported were a 750000 fine against usair 
in march 1987 and a 402000 fine against continental in april 1986 
the newsletter said 
the fines were for anything from carrying illegal drugs to 
violations of nighttime noise regulations or noncompliance with 
airworthiness regulations the newsletter said although it did not 
specify what any particular fine was for 
the newsletter said the faa has no set policy on which fines are 
announced and which are not but said it is considering issuing a 
monthly summary of all settled civil enforcement actions 
john leyden chief of the faas public communications office 
said today he had not seen the newsletters report he said 
however that all fines are recorded in a public docket that is 
available to news media and also included in a data base to which 
news media have access in oklahoma city 
leyden acknowledged however that officials in the agency are 
considering ways to be more consistent in putting out information 
about enforcement actions including the possiblity of putting out a 
regular summary or setting a policy of issuing news releases on all 
fines over a certain amount 
its basically a judgment call we recognize the need for some 
improvement leyden said he said the agency does not put out 
releases on every contract or regulatory action many of which take 
place under regional faa jurisdictions 
leyden said airline companies want to avoid public announcement 
of fines because they worry about the publicity but he said this 
does not affect the decision on which fines are included in faa news 
releases 
other fines not previously reported since 1985 were four fines 
totaling 215000 against twa two totaling 153400 against delta 
two totaling 56000 against pan american a 35000 fine against 
eastern 35000 against usair 50000 against united 102000 
against american and 46000 against northwest 
the newsletter principally serves attorneys law schools media 
organizations and criminologists

inflation and interest rates in recent months interest rates 
declined modestly in the credit markets today 
but analysts said many traders remained unconvinced that 
inflation was ready to abate after backtoback increases of a full

the air forces deal for 68 million in crash 
damage kits for its c5 cargo aircraft involved every sorry facet 
of defense contracting including a conflictofinterest violation 
and vastly overpriced parts a congressman said today 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm found 
that lockheed aeronautical systems co hired a retired us air 
force colonel shortly after he negotiated a pentagon contract with 
the defense contractor to buy the crash damage kits 
the review also found that among the prices lockheed aeronautical 
systems co proposed for items in the 6600part kit were 22994 
for a nickelsize washer and 21113 for an inchlong shim a metal 
wedge that was an excess part from production of the c5b and 
originally valued at 2209 
this order involves virtually every sorry facet of defense 
contracting said rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations 
we have a costly acquisition program with no justification a 
clear conflict of interest the revolving door apparent fraud 
outrageous prices overpricing and a good example of the impotence 
of civilian control of the military 
gao official harry finley told the subcommittee that retired air 
force col anthony diferdinando did not comply with provisions in 
a conflict of interest law requiring that he report his employment 
contracts and disqualify himself from procurement functions 
involving lockheed 
under questioning from rep thomas biley rva finley said that 
in april 1986 diferdinando signed a memo which said the air force 
needed the kits needed the money to purchase them and specified 
that the contractor should be lockheed 
one month later diferdinando made his first contact with the 
company about employment 
dingell said that the air force office of special investigations 
notified the subcommittee that a criminal investigation of the 
colonel for conflict of interest was begun last thursday 
the subcommittee asked the gao to look into the san antonio air 
logistics centers purchase of the kits and an allegation that 
diferdinando violated conflict of interest laws during the 
procurement process 
according to a gao chronology diferdinando initiated acquisition 
of the crash damage kits requesting funding for 147 kits less than 
a month later the colonel requested an application for employment 
at lockheed 
diferdinando retired from the air force on july 1 1986 and on 
dec 2 1986 the air logistics center issued its first order for 
the kits at an estimated value of 446 million 
less than three weeks later lockheed offered diferdinando a job 
and on feb 2 1987 the colonel reported for work in lockheeds 
international marketing division responsible for marketing the c130 
aircraft in middle eastern countries 
the gao concluded that diferdinando failed to comply with a 
pentagon requirement that an individual promptly report contacts 
with a contractor or disqualify himself or herself if required to 
do so 
however we did not find any evidence to indicate that his 
actions regarding the purchase of the kits were influenced by 
employment the gao said 
the investigative arm said it will refer the matter to the 
defense secretary who could impose a penalty of up to 10000 
a spokesman for lockheed hugh burns declined to comment on the 
gao findings until after the subcommittees hearings today 
the gao review found that c5 system managers based their request 
for the kits on two crashes and one lightning strike which did not 
provide sufficient data for a decision in fact the gao found that 
the kits cannot be used to repair a c5a that was damaged in a fire 
at travis air force base on dec 30 1988 
air force officials questioned the type of parts procured and the 
prices proposed by lockheed including shims priced at 21133 and 
16097 in response to the air force plant representative offices 
concerns about transfers of excess parts lockheed proposed about a 
1 million reduction 
the air forces reservations about the contract were evident in 
an internal memo written by eric m thorson acting assistant 
secretary of the air force 
thirtynine percent of all items reviewed have failed the 
intrinsic value test thorson said if that model holds 
approximately 6000 parts will be potential toilet pans for mr 
dingell to hold up in a hearing

in some conversations about retirement planning 
these days annuities are displacing individual retirement accounts 
as the prime subject 
iras of course have lost a bit of their luster for those savers 
and investors who can no longer deduct annual contributions of up to 
2000 
furthermore while anybody can still make nondeductible ira 
contributions doing so means taking on some formidable tax 
paperwork 
enter the advocates of socalled deferred annuities proclaiming 
the stillintact virtues of these vehicles after tax reform 
todays annuity plans offered by some of the nations largest 
life insurance companies are more attractive than ever as companies 
struggle to boost their market share of investment dollars says 
donoghues moneyletter a financial advisory publication 
the number of choices open to the wouldbe annuity investor can 
be daunting these products come in more varieties than the common 
cold 
but the vehicle getting most of the attention right now isnt all 
that complicated it simply wraps an investment in a mutual fund 
family in the coating of the tax advantages that an annuity provides 
all income taxes on capital gains and dividends are deferred 
until a withdrawal is made from the account says glenn sinichko 
of clevelandbased prescott ball amp turben inc in the firms 
monthly investor news transfers from one fund to another are 
taxfree 
as with a standard taxable investment in mutual funds there is 
no limit on how much you can put into your account in any given year 
another edge for annuities over iras 
as even annuities biggest fans will readily admit they arent 
the answer for everybody 
if you have access to an employersponsored 401k retirement 
savings plan where you work it may make better sense the 
contributions you make to a 401k are deductible and many 
employers kick in extra amounts when you make contributions 
similarly if you are selfemployed you might look first at a 
keogh plan which allows generous deductible contributions 
aside from these situations however the donoghue letter argues 
that youll be hardpressed to find a better more flexible 
taxdeferred retirement plan than what annuities offer 
shoppers for annuities need to ask quite a few questions 
conservative investors who opt for a fixedrate annuity need to 
focus particularly on the guaranteed benefit offered by any given 
contract 
in this area advisers say beware the plan that offers a 
temptingly high return in the early stages but that can 
subsequently revert to low returns in later years 
furthermore what surrender charges does the contract spell out 
if you should want to take your money out before you reach age 59 
with any annuity as with an ira such a withdrawal would incur a 
10 percent penalty tax from uncle sam the seller of the annuity may 
or may not charge you an additional penalty 
then there is the matter of costs modern annuities offer plenty 
of choices that dont come with the large upfront sales charge that 
used to be standard in the industry 
still its advisable to check annual contract fees and asset 
charges collected by the insurance company which come atop 
management fees assessed by the firm that runs the mutual funds 
lastly you need to take a look at the fund family itself does 
it offer the kinds of funds that suit your goals and temperament 
what is its past performance record 
if you buy a variable annuity it is imperative to remember you 
have the hope that your money can grow along with the forward 
advance of the financial markets and the risk of poor results if 
the markets dont advance but retreat

gpa jetprop ltd today gave the boeing cos de 
havilland division its largest order ever a 425 million deal for 
38 dash 8 series 300 turboprop planes 
the order to the downsview ontariobased division of boeing 
canada came the same day that american airlines ordered 35 
commercial jetliners from boeing commercial airplanes in a deal 
estimated at 187 billion to 208 billion 
de havillands order is the largest in its history and probably 
the largest ever for a single model of turboprop airliner said tom 
appleton de havilland vice president for marketing and sales 
the twinengine dash 8 series 300 carries 50 to 56 passengers and 
is used primarily on commuter routes the first plane in the series 
was delivered last month to time air of lethbridge alberta 
with gpa jetprops order de havilland has firm orders and 
options for 86 of the aircraft valued at more than 1 billion 
gpa jetprop a partnership between gpa group ltd of shannon 
ireland and pwa corp of calgary alberta is a major lessor of 
turboprop aircraft 
this order transforms us to a central role in the turboprop 
acquisition business said naill greene gpa jetprop managing 
director we have gone from being a boutique to being a department 
store 
gpa jetprop earlier ordered nine dash 8 series 100 aircraft 
which carry 37 to 40 passengers and took options on another five 
greene said gpa jetprops ability to order large numbers of 
aircraft will benefit both manufacturers and the airlines that lease 
its planes 
the smaller airlines simply could not compete for the equipment 
of their choice over the next few years because of the relatively 
short planning horizons to which they must work he said and 
the cash flow implications of having to hold positions for 
deliveries three to four years hence could be disasterous to some 
operators 
for the entire dash 8 family de havilland now has orders and 
options for 297 aircraft from 34 customers 
in addition to ordering 25 boeing 757200s and 10 767300er 
aircraft american placed firm orders for 75 fokker 100 shorthaul 
jets and took options for another 75 in a deal potentially worth 
309 billion for the dutch planebuilder

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
said today that rising interest rates are hurting the savings and 
loan industry but he contended that sampls and the economy would be 
worse off had the central bank not driven up the rates for the past 
year 
responding to criticism of fed policy from members of a house 
banking subcommittee greenspan said theres certainly no 
question that the higher interest rates are the more difficult it 
is for the thrifts 
but he said if the fed had not moved to dampen inflationary 
pressures by driving up rates rates would have increased even more 
on their own as investors sought returns compensating them for 
higher inflation 
its our view that the actions we have taken to date probably 
have made interest rates certainly in the long end of the market 
significantly lower than they would have otherwise been greenspan 
said 
he also said that economic conditions today cannot be compared to 
those that led to doubledigit inflation and interest rates topping 
20 percent in the early 1980s he said recent economic reports 
indicating a pickup in inflation are partly a reflection of 
pressures that have been evolving all along 
greenspan testified a day after regulators reported that the sampl 
industry after enduring a record loss in 1988 was threatened by 
rising interest rates 
the federal home loan bank board said tuesday that the nations 
2949 sampls lost 23 billion in the fourth quarter pushing red ink 
for the year to 121 billion well past the previous record of 78 
billion set in 1987 
much of last years red ink 11 billion was old in the sense 
that institutions finally got around to recognizing bad loans that 
had long ago gone sour 
james barth chief economist of the bank board and a number of 
private analysts believe these nonoperating losses and thus 
overall losses will decline this year to lower but 
stilltroublesome levels 
however they warn that rising interest rates which increased 3 
percentage points over the past year and continue to climb will eat 
away at the industrys slim operating profit 900 million last year 
operating income should be lower across the board for all 
thrifts in the first and second quarters barth said 
savings and loans make their money by borrowing shortterm from 
depositors and lending longterm for mortgages and other purposes 
when long rates are higher than short rates the normal pattern 
institutions earn more on loans than they pay to depositors but 
currently shortterm rates approach and in some cases surpass 
longterm rates severely cutting into earnings 
robert litan a banking expert at the brookings institution a 
washingtonbased liberaloriented research organization said he is 
worried that higher rates will begin to erode the half of the 
industry that is somewhere between healthy and insolvent or nearly 
insolvent 
according to the bank board 1226 institutions representing 21 
percent of the industrys assets have capital levels exceeding 6 
percent litan said most of these healthy institutions will earn 
less but will still weather 1989 in fine shape 
there are 364 institutions with 8 percent of the industrys 
assets that have failed and are waiting to be closed or sold by the 
government another 390 sampls with 23 percent of the assets are 
solvent but dont meet the current 3 percent capital standard litan 
says they are in effect already dead 
that leaves 969 sampls with 47 percent of the assets struggling 
to bring their capital up to the tougher 6 percent standard that 
would be required by june 1991 under the sampl plan proposed by 
president bush 
the real issue for the future is what happens to the 
threetosixes i worry about this category theyre not 
immediately threatened but what they do in the next three to four 
years is crucial these guys are going to be under a lot of pressure 
to take risks he said 
bert ely an alexandria va financial institutions analyst 
said this years improved performance will be attributable to a 
significant degree to 5 billion to 6 billion in government 
assistance flowing into the sampls rescued last year in the busiest 
year for regulators since the depression 
its just like the farm economy if we have better results in 
1989 its only because a substantial subsidy is being pumped into 
the industry he said 
meanwhile the bank boards barth said the heaviest losses 
continued to be concentrated in just a few institutions with the 20 
mosttroubled institutions losing 2 billion in the fourth quarter 
nine of the worst 20 were in texas and the states 204 
institutions collectively lost 14 billion in the fourth quarter 
and 101 billion in all of 1988 
for the year the 30 percent of the industry that was 
unprofitable lost 177 billion more than swamping the 56 billion 
earned by solvent institutions

market sentiment was gloomy about interestrate prospects despite 
this weeks us reports on consumer prices and durable goods orders 
which showed slower growth than had been expected 
instead players have focused on us producer prices which have 
jumped 1 percent in each of the past two months its just a matter 
of time traders say until this leads to higher consumer prices as 
well 
despite the generally betterthanexpected consumer price 
numbers both our markets in new york and london are increasingly

losses in their securities businesses left morgan 
grenfell group plc with an overall loss in 1988 and kleinwort benson 
group plc with lower earnings for the year the british banking 
companies said wednesday 
both companies expressed confidence in the outlook for 1989 
however 
morgan grenfell which decided to pull out of marketmaking in 
british equities and government bonds last december said its 
aftertax profit dropped 47 percent to 201 million pounds which is 
about 35 million or 121 pence a share from 377 million pounds 
or 238 pence a share in 1987 
after an extraordinary charge of 392 million pounds or 67 
million resulting from the closure of its broking operations 
morgan grenfell had a net loss of 208 million pounds about 36 
million compared with net profit of 402 million pounds in 1987 
morgan grenfell said its pretax profit tumbled to 337 million 
pounds about 58 million from 601 million pounds the previous 
year 
the securities business moved heavily into loss in the second 
half and it was these losses coupled with a realistic assessment 
of the outlook for the business that caused us to withdraw said 
john craven morgan grenfells chief executive 
morgan grenfell said the closure of its equity operations leaves 
the group in a better financial position to concentrate on its 
banking corporate finance and asset management operations 
we do not see the need for further major retrenchment craven 
said 
before it was closed down in december the equities operations 
had trading losses of 21 million pounds about 36 million in 1988 
morgan grenfell said 
kleinwort said its aftertax profit plummeted to 88 million 
pounds about 15 million or 666 pence a share in 1988 from 384 
million pounds or 3466 pence a share in 1987 
kleinwort said its pretax profit slumped to 177 million pounds 
or about 30 million from 516 million pounds a year earlier 
in the last six months of 1988 when british equity marketmakers 
took part in a price war in an effort to boost their share of the 
depressed broking business kleinwort said it had a pretax loss of 
173 million pounds or about 30 million 
kleinwort said its british equities business has been profitable 
this year 
we remain committed to providing our corporate government and 
individual clients with a range of integrated financial services in 
selected areas said kleinwort chairman david peake 
the companies didnt break out quarterly or halfyear results

the industry average age was about 1267 years as of july 1 
1988 the last date reliable statistics were available according to 
avmark inc an aviation consulting firm in arlington va 
the public wants to fly on airlines that have younger quieter

last week american announced a 95 million expansion of its 
corporate headquarters in fort worth texas and began distributing 
121 million in profit sharing to employees the carrier also plans 
within the next several weeks to announce the location for a new 
200 million maintenance facility

digital equipment corp on wednesday became the 
latest technology giant to fall victim to lowered earnings estimates 
as its stock plunged more than 11 a share by midafternoon 
the stock was off 1112 at 9650 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading a decline of more than 10 percent it was 
the most heavily traded issue on the big board 
digitals decline came after the maynard massbased computer 
maker indicated to analysts that its order rate in the current 
quarter was likely to be lower than some analysts expectations 
despite success in the marketplace the worlds second biggest 
computer company after ibm has been a serious disappointment to 
investors its stock price is half its peak of 199 a share in 
august 1987 which was the time of the stock markets alltime high 
digitals fall followed similar drops in recent months by apple 
computer inc microsoft corp and international business machines 
corp 
analysts said there was no single factor accounting for all the 
reductions in earnings estimates such as sudden weakness in the 
economy in fact the economy has been growing strongly in recent 
months 
ibm attributed its more cautious outlook to a chip problem that 
delayed mainframe computer shipments apple blamed stockpiling of 
highpriced memory chips and microsoft blamed delays in shipments 
of new wordprocessing programs 
we had been suggesting for over a year now that the us 
business has been lagging our internal expectations and that has 
continued through the third quarter mark steinkrauss head of 
investor relations for digital said in an interview 
we have just not seen a meaningful pickup in our us business 
despite the fact that weve introduced many new products 
steinkrauss added 
carol muratore a morgan stanley amp co analyst was the first to 
lower her estimates after receiving guidance from the company 
steinkrauss said 
george elling a merrill lynch amp co analyst said he lowered his 
projected earnings to 175 to 180 a share in the current quarter 
he had expected earnings would be flat with the 233 a share a year 
earlier 
revenue in the quarter could be 100 million below earlier 
expectations of 32 billion he said 
the basic story is still a good one its the beginning of a 
good solid product cycle for digital said laura conigliaro a 
prudentialbache securities inc analyst who also cut her estimates

lasted since the end of february said a trader with a large us

soaking for the region early next week

trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago you can kill a 
crop two or three times and still come back and have a record 
harvest its happened before

the hung jury of nine women and three men was considered a 
significant setback for the government in its campaign against 
securities fraud and raised questions about how much effort federal 
prosecutors will expend on a case that many wall street defense 
lawyers have called weak 
the manhattan us attorneys office has brought charges in more 
than 50 securities fraud cases since 1983 but nearly all the claims 
have involved civil charges criminal frauds to date including 
pending charges against drexel burnham lambert inc have been 
settled through plea bargains 
the government based its case against gaf and sherwin largely on 
the testimony of los angeles broker boyd l jefferies an admitted 
felon expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as 
part of a plea arrangement with the government 
jefferies testified that sherwin asked him to boost union 
carbides price and promosed to compensate him for any loss 
but several parts of jefferies testimony were contradicted by 
his main associate james melton who said sherwin never asked him 
personally to manipulate union carbide stock 
defense lawyers branded jefferies a crook who had schemed 
illegally with nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky and turned 
states evidence to minimize his own punishment 
jefferies 58 last year agreed to plead guilty to two securities 
law violations after he was implicated by boesky who paid 100 
million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986 
jefferies testimony is seen as crucial to separate 
boeskyderived cases against speculator salim b lewis and takeover 
specialist paul bilzerian

the supreme court in cases from arkansas and 
florida was urged wednesday to order refunds to trucking companies 
and a liquor distributor that paid taxes under laws that were 
declared unconstitutional 
in both cases courts ruled that the state taxes favored instate 
companies 
andrew l frey a lawyer representing trucking companies seeking 
about 160 million from arkansas said anybody should have known 
when it was enacted that the trucking tax might be 
unconstitutional 
frey also said that refunding the money would not cripple the 
arkansas treasury because the repayments can be spread out over 
several years and may be financed by bond issues 
but a raymond randolph a lawyer here who represented arkansas 
said nothing in federal law gives the courts power to order 
retroactive relief when a state tax is found to have violated the 
constitutions commerce clause 
a commerce clause violation does not carry with it a license to 
the judiciary to create a damages remedy he said 
some justices questioned whether granting the trucking companies 
and liquor dealer tax refunds would provide them with a windfall 
since they may have passed on the higher taxes to their customers 
david g robertson a lawyer representing the liquor dealer in 
the florida case said his client would have suffered a 
competitive disadvantage if it raised prices to help defray the 
taxes 
h barton farr of washington dc representing the florida 
officials said outofstate liquor dealers suffered no actual harm 
the challenged tax granted an exemption to instate dealers that did 
not cost the outofstate dealers additional money he said 
if the tax was enjoined before it took effect the 
outofstate dealers would not have saved a dime he said 
the high court expected to announce rulings in the two cases by 
july is reviewing decisions that denied tax refunds to the truckers 
and liquor dealers 
mckesson corp a wholesale liquor distributor is seeking a 
refund for taxes paid under a state levy declared unconstitutional 
by the florida supreme court 
the state court denied a refund to mckesson and other 
outofstate dealers noting they would in all proabability 
receive a windfall since the cost of the tax has likely been passed 
on to their customers 
in the arkansas case that states supreme court declared the 
truck tax unconstitutional a year ago 
the state court based its ruling on a us supreme court decision 
in june 1987 that struck down a similar tax in pennsylvania on 
grounds it discriminated unlawfully against interstate truckers 
the arkansas court ordered state officials to refund to the 
truckers 49 million that had been held in a special escrow fund 
created in august 1987 
but the state court said the truckers are not entitled to 
additional refunds on taxes the state collected but had not placed 
in the separate fund 
the arkansas supreme court said the equities favor disallowing 
refund of the tax money already paid into the state treasury 
the us supreme court in 1987 struck down a socalled flat tax 
that pennsylvania imposed on all truck companies that used its 
highways the justices said the tax favored pennsylvania companies 
because they paid the same amount of money as interstate haulers 
even though the trucks owned by interstate companies traveled far 
fewer miles on pennsylvania highways 
the arkansas legislature in october 1987 repealed a state tax 
enacted in 1983 that had features similar to the pennsylvania tax 
the arkansas tax was replaced with one that imposed a rate of 25 
cents per mile on all users of arkansas highways 
the new law allowed arkansas officials to collect the invalidated 
tax for another year 
the 1983 tax required heavy trucks operating on arkansas highways 
to pay either an annual flat rate of 175 or five cents for each 
mile traveled in arkansas 
american trucking associations and others challenged the arkansas 
tax on grounds it favored frequent users of the state roads since 
after 3500 miles of annual highway use by any vehicle it became 
advantageous to pay the flat 175 rate thus instate trucks 
benefitted by the tax scheme they successfully argued before lower 
courts 
the cases are mckesson corp vs florida division of alcoholic 
beverages 88192 and american trucks associations vs smith 
88325

the supreme court on wednesday limited the 
federal tax bite on some business mergers handing a victory to 
investors and business owners 
in an 81 ruling the justices said a cash payment in some 
transactions commonly known as a boot should be taxed as a 
capital gain rather than a dividend taxed as ordinary income 
the capital gain tax rate generally is lower although the tax 
reform bill enacted in 1986 largely eliminated the different tax 
rates for capital gains and ordinary income 
the court said the distinction between tax rates still applies to 
a significant degree 
for example it said taxpayers may deduct capital losses to the 
full extent of their capital gains but they only are allowed to 
offset up to 3000 of ordinary income insofar as their capital 
losses exceed their capital gains 
todays case stems from the acquisition of a small west virginia 
company by a corporation traded on the new york stock exchange 
the smaller company basin surveys inc was owned by donald e 
clark of buckhannon wva basin surveys provides radiation nuclear 
and electronic openhole logging services to the petroleum industry 
clark sold the business in 1979 to nl industries in new jersey 
which produces petroleum equipment chemicals and metals 
nl industries gave clark 300000 shares of its stock and 325 
million to acquire basin surveys the cash payment is characterized 
as boot in such deals 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of clark in 
1987 sparing him from paying 972505 in tax 
the supreme court today agreed with the appeals court that under 
federal law because clark surrendered more than 20 percent of his 
interest in nl industries he was entitled to capital gain 
treatment 
the 20 percent figure was based on nl industries offer to clark 
of two choices he could receive 425000 shares of nl industries 
stock or 300000 shares plus 325 million in cash 
by choosing the latter option clark in effect gave up more 
than 30 percent of his interest in nl industries in return for the 
cash the court said 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court today said 
under federal law a shareholder who relinquishes more than 20 
percent of his corporate control and is less than a 50 percent 
shareholder after the transaction is entitled to have cash proceeds 
from the transaction treated as capital gains 
stevens said the bootforstock exchange in this case may 
properly be characterized as a sale of stock significantlythere 
is little risk that the reorganization at issue was used as a ruse 
to distribute dividend 
justice byron r white dissented 
the case is commissioner of internal revenue vs clark 871168

energy prices posted mixed results in fairly 
heavy trading wednesday as crude oil pulled back and wholesale home 
heating oil moved ahead 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil finished 
off 1 cent at 2004 a barrel after gaining 71 cents on tuesday 
refined petroleum products traded on the exchange had a better 
showing 
heating oil for april delivery rose 057 cent to 56 cents a 
gallon the april contract for unleaded gasoline rose 021 cent to 
5735 cents a gallon 
linda simard an energy broker at drexel burnham lambert inc 
said many traders had expected a big selloff after tuesdays strong 
performance but the market held up well despite industry figures 
that showed a buildup in crude oil stocks 
the american petroleum institute reported late tuesday after the 
market closed that crude oil stocks expanded by 71 million barrels 
in the week ended march 17 heating oil declined 12 million barrels 
and gasoline slipped by 630000 barrels 
everybody was expecting a big selloff but the market looks 
steady she said 
crude oil ended the day significantly above its lowest levels of 
the session the may contract had been down more than 30 cents at 
one point 
traders said speculative buying interest and a belief that 
fundamentally the market is strong due to opecs apparent success in 
abiding by its production quota has supported the market 
energy market participants have expressed optimism that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries can stick to its 
agreement to lower production 
in an attempt to shore up oil prices that had been weighed down 
by an abundance of oil on world markets the cartel last year 
established a new lower output quota 
opecs new quota of 185 million barrels a day took effect jan 1 
and extends for six months reports last month indicated the cartel 
was still producing above 19 million barrels but new estimates are 
that opec output is closer to the target

kellogg co said wednesday the 
dottedline bowlinabox perforations that disappeared from its 
singleserving cereal boxes 14 years ago will be back this summer 
the packages also will be 30 percent larger and customers 
probably will see some price increases when the new boxes appear on 
grocery shelves in june kellogg spokesman dick lovell said 
prices customers pay vary because they are set by retailers and 
kellogg does not divulge its wholesale prices 
the packages will be plastic lined and moistureproof with the 
reintroduction of the perforated front panel that lets people eat 
cereal and milk from the box 
the bowlinabox perforations were introduced in 1942 but 
dropped in 1975 due to manufacturing difficulties lovell said 
were beyond that now so we wanted to provide this extra 
convenience 
lovell said the larger individualportion boxes already are being 
supplied to institutional and foodservice customers in groceries 
the singleserving boxes still will be sold in 6 12and 18package 
sizes he said 
he said the bigger boxes are designed to protect cereal better 
and hold more and the increase in volume will vary from product to 
product depending on the density of the cereal 
lovell said that there will be modest increases in the wholesale 
prices but that customers will get more cereal for their money 
because of the increase in package size 
at a kroger co store in dearborn on wednesday the kelloggs 
singleserving cereals were selling for 177 for the sixpackage 
snack pack and 229 for the 12package variety pack

the air force cant repair a firedamaged c5a 
aircraft with repair kits it purchased from lockheed in a 68 
million deal marked by conflict of interest allegations and proposed 
charges of 22994 for nickelsized washers witnesses told a house 
subcommittee wednesday 
this order involves virtually every sorry facet of defense 
contracting said rep john dingell dmich whose house energy 
and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations presented 
a tale of possible fraud revolving door hiring practices and vastly 
overpriced parts in the deal with lockheed aeronautical systems co 
witnesses before the panel said the air force failed to conduct 
an economic analysis on the order and that such analyses are 
supposed to be standard practice on deals of more than 1 million 
the service also was criticized for how it decided what repair 
kits to keep on hand for future crashes investigators for the 
congressional general accounting office said the decision was based 
on three incidents two crashes and a lightning strike 
the data of three crashes was not enough to predict the number 
and timing of future crashes harry finley director of air 
force issues for the gao told the subcommittee 
in fact a c5a damaged in a fire at travis air force base in 
california on dec 30 1988 cannot be repaired with the kit the 
6600part kit is for repair to the underbelly of the aircraft and 
the damaged c5a has a hole about 13 feet by 33 feet in the upper 
fuselage finley said 
how can we know in advance what parts will be destroyed in a 
crash dingell said adding that in the case of the c5a they 
obviously guessed wrong 
the gaos investigation found that an air force colonel 
negotiated the pentagon contract with lockheed and then later went 
to work for the company 
under questioning from rep thomas bliley rva finley said 
that in april 1986 air force col anthony diferdinando signed a 
memo which said the air force needed the kits needed the money to 
purchase them and specified that the contractor should be lockheed 
one month later diferdinando made his first contact with the 
company about employment 
the gao said diferdinando retired from the air force on july 1 
1986 and on dec 2 1986 the air logistics center issued its first 
order for the kits at an estimated value of 446 million 
less than three weeks later lockheed offered diferdinando a job 
and on feb 2 1987 he reported for work at a lockheed marketing 
division responsible for marketing the c130 aircraft in the middle 
east 
finley told the subcommittee that diferdinando did not comply 
with provisions in a conflict of interest law requiring that he 
report his employment contracts and disqualify himself from 
procurement functions involving lockheed 
however we did not find any evidence to indicate that his 
actions regarding the purchase of the kits were influenced by 
employment the gao said 
dingell said the air force office of special investigations 
notified the subcommittee that it began a criminal investigation of 
the colonel for conflict of interest last thursday 
a spokesman for lockheed hugh burns said the company has 
complied with all conflict of interest laws and to the best of our 
knowledge so did mr diferdinando difendinando remains an 
employee at lockheed 
burns also said the cost of the parts were estimated prices and 
final amounts will be negotiated 
at the hearing dingell questioned lockheeds proposed prices of 
22994 for a nickelsize washer and 21113 for an inchlong

consumer electronics giant thorn emi plc has agreed 
to pay up to 1041 million for a halfinterest in the britishowned 
record maker chrysalis record companies the companies said 
wednesday 
if the deal is completed thorn emi would manufacture and 
distribute records for chrysalis the label for billy idol huey 
lewis and the news pat benatar and others 
thorn emi artists include paul mccartney pink floyd tina 
turner david bowie and others and the company also has a large 
classical music catalog 
chrysalis would continue to operate independently in the united 
kingdom and the united states the companies said in announcing the 
deal chrysalis chairman and cofounder chris wright who owns 43 
percent of chrysalis group stock would remain at the helm 
thorn emi has agreed to pay up to 791 million up front and up 
to 25 million more depending on profit and sales for the next four 
years the transaction requires government approval and the blessing 
of chrysalis shareholders 
the deal gives thorn the option to buy the other half of 
chrysalis record companies from chrysalis group plc after march 
1999 and chrysalis could compel the sale after march 1996 the 
companies said 
the agreement between emis music division and chrysalis applies 
only to chrysalis recording arm and does not include its music 
publishing recording studios and video export business 
the publishing arm protects and exploits copyright on songs and 
many of its artists are signed to record labels other than 
chrysalis the only involvement emi will have on this side of the 
business is administering publishing rights in some overseas 
territories 
last december it was disclosed that los angelesbased record 
producer david geffen had built up an 84 percent stake in 
chrysalis at the time wright made it clear he did not regard the 
stakebuilding as friendly to chrysalis management 
the group ran into trouble during 1988 as profits plunged to 
about 2 million from 125 the previous year largely due to losses 
in the united states

a federal appeals court refused wednesday to let 
commuter railroad workers cripple northeast rail transit by honoring 
the picket lines of striking eastern airlines machinists 
the unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with eastern workers 
but the appeals court refused to lift a lower courts bar on such 
strikes 
however the appeals court agreed to hold a hearing early next 
week on the unions arguments for it to overturn the lower court 
order barring sympathy walkouts at the long island rail road 
metronorth commuter railroad nj transit and amtrak 
on monday us district judge robert patterson jr barred 
unionized workers at the four lines from honoring the picket lines 
of striking eastern machinists the injunction did not bar 
picketing merely any organized walkout in sympathy with the 
picketers 
prior to the appeals court ruling union lawyer richard ruda told 
the threejudge panel there could be no distinction between setting 
up picket lines and honoring them union members dont cross 
picket lines he said adding that respecting the power of a 
picket line is virtually a matter of religion to unionists 
there simply is a fundamental right to honor picket lines 
ruda said 
but bernard plum a lawyer for metronorth and the lirr argued 
that pattersons injunction only kept union leaders from ordering 
their members not to cross picket lines 
patterson sought to eliminate the sense of compulsion to honor 
picket lines that had been spread by the unions said plum 
amtrak lawyer sally garr added that sympathy strikes would 
disrupt all of the commuter traffic in the northeast she said the 
harm the unions would endure if their right to sympathy strikes were 
limited was less than the irreparable harm to almost 500000 
daily amtrak riders 
certainly the public should not be held hostage to this labor 
dispute she said 
in rebuttal ruda the union lawyer said earlier court 
decisions including one by the us supreme court have found that 
the threat of a railroad shutdown is not enough to abridge union 
rights 
he maintained that any commuter chaos caused by railroad workers 
sympathy strikes might pressure president bush to intervene in the 
eastern strike which began march 4 
the pressure in this instance is directed at the president 
said ruda bush he noted is empowered to create a task force to 
impose a 60day cooling off period and make recommendations to 
settle the eastern strike

officials of black amp decker corp which 
has agreed to buy emhart corp in a 28 billion takeover said 
wednesday they were not worried about emharts indication that it 
still would consider a higher bid from a rival suitor 
in documents filed tuesday with the securities and exchange 
commission emhart said it offered new yorkbased investment 
partnership topper lp the chance to review internal emhart 
information under a confidentiality agreement if the information 
would help topper formulate a higher bid 
emhart has rejected as inadequate toppers unsolicited 35 a 
share or 24 billion buyout offer 
the proposed confidentiality agreement outlined in the sec filing 
would require that topper whose investors include oil heir gordon 
p getty make an offer for all emhart shares that was richer than 
black amp deckers 40ashare offer 
a black amp decker spokeswoman said the agreement was not unusual 
in takeover attempts and the company was proceeding with its effort 
to acquire emhart stock 
any board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to 
consider any offers that would come along black amp decker 
spokeswoman barbara lucas said wednesday 
suppose someone offers 60 a share we cant foreclose them 
from considering that offer but they have indicated that ours is a 
full and fair price she said 
emhart spokesman jonathan williams declined comment saying the 
sec filing speaks for itself 
emharts stock closed at 41 per share wednesday unchanged from 
tuesdays close on the new york stock exchange black amp decker 
finished unchanged at 1987 
the deal between black amp decker and emhart includes a provision 
that emhart pay the towson mdbased company between 65 and 85 
million if the deal falls through such breakup fees are common in 
takeovers where a third party has made a competing offer 
topper refused comment wednesday reiterating its statement that 
it was studying its options in the wake of black amp deckers offer 
and that its 35ashare offer was negotiable 
in rejecting toppers bid emhart officials said it was too low 
and that unusual trading activity before announcement of the 
unsolicited offer raised concerns of illegal insider trading 
the federal trade commission is investigating the timing of 
toppers filing on the proposed buyout and the amount of stock the 
partnership acquired before the filing

warnerlambert co announced wednesday that 
it filed a 55 million suit against a philadelphia company charging 
it failed to give early warning that a poisonous ingredient had been 
sold to the company 
the complaint filed in superior court in morristown on tuesday 
charges that rohm and hass co learned in late 1987 that the 
cholestyramine resin it had sold to warnerlambert was contaminated 
with pesticides and other contaminants 
warnerlambert a pharmaceutical and health care company was 
using the ingredient in cholybar a cholesterollowering drug that 
was the first prescription drug to come in candy bar form said 
cohen 
they implied in march that there was a minor problem and waited 
until april to say there was a serious problem just a month before 
we were approved and ready to go said warnerlambert spokesman 
barry cohen 
competitor bristolmyers which uses cholestyramine resin in the 
powdered drug questran was notified immediately of the problem 
cohen said 
warnerlambert had to quarantine several million bars of cholybar 
it manufactured and delay the may 1988 release of the drug 
cholybar went on the market in january after a new supplier of 
the ingredient was found cohen said 
rohm and haas spokesman george bochanski said the company 
notified bristolmyers first because it already had a drug on the 
market 
bochanski said the company believed warnerlambert was 
developing and not yet manufacturing the drug 
if they were stockpiling thats a business decision that might 
have caused more trouble in their planning procedures than anything 
rohm and hass did said bochanski 
cohen said the drug would have sold well because patients would 
have found it easy to take than the available powdered drug 
the powder form tastes like sand and smells like fish said 
cohen 
the company is suing for punitive and treble damages no court 
date has been set 
warnerlambert reported earnings of 39 billion last year while 
rohm and haas a specialty chemical manufacturer earned 25 
billion

the federal trustee supervising administration of 
the eastern airlines bankruptcy reorganization on wednesday 
appointed a 15member committee to represent unsecured creditors of 
the striketorn airline 
the new creditors committee includes representatives of the 
machinists union and pilots union at miamibased eastern 
the machinists struck the airline on march 4 after 17 months of 
wrangling with management over a contract the pilots support for 
the walkout virtually grounded eastern and forced it to file for 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
laws on march 9 
the eastern pilots are owed more than 500 million in back pay 
and other claims said ron cole a spokesman in miami for the air 
line pilots association 
a federal appeals court in new york meanwhile refused to let 
commuter railroad workers cripple northeast rail transit by honoring 
the picket lines of striking eastern machinists 
the unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with eastern workers 
but the appeals court refused to lift a lower courts bar on such 
strikes 
in houston officials of easterns sister carrier continental 
airlines preparing for heavy easter travel dismissed the effects of 
a flight attendants strike they said the walkout is not disturbing 
service despite union claims of delays and cancellations 
the creditors panel also includes a representative of nonunion 
employees of eastern most of whom were laid off shortly after the 
strike began and are demanding back pay 
the creditors committee has the right to review any 
reorganization plan proposed by eastern and can propose its own plan 
to the bankruptcy judge 
us trustee harold jones told a gathering of around 400 creditor 
representatives financial analysts and reporters that the role of 
the creditors panel is far more expansive than his 
eastern says it has 59 billion in assets and 45 billion in 
liabilities unsecured creditors such as ticketholders and travel 
agents are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy 
reorganization because they have no collateral or security from 
the debtor in case of default 
the airlines secured creditors mainly bondholders met with 
eastern president phil bakes on tuesday 
easterns liabilities include 169 billion in longterm debt 
736 million in capital lease obligations and 165 million in unused 
tickets issued to passengers harvey miller one of easterns 
bankruptcy attorneys told the creditors meeting 
the objective of chapter 11 is to rebuild eastern said 
miller a partner in weil gotschal manges it is easterns plan 
to resuscitate the airline and build back its flight schedule 
the embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots 
in newspapers only about 200 of the 3600 or so pilots at eastern 
have crossed machinist picket lines to fly eastern is operating 
only a fraction of the flights in its normal schedule except for 
nearly normal service on its northeast air shuttle and to latin 
america 
miller said 167 planes out of easterns fleet of 254 aircraft are 
currently inactive parked on airport runways in miami atlanta 
orlando fla and new york kennedy international airport 
in addition to the international association of machinists and 
the air line pilots association the other members of the unsecured 
creditors committee are as follows where available the amount 
owed them by eastern is included 
aircraft manufacturer airbus industrie 9594 million general 
electric co 7547 million citicorp united states trust co of 
new york 5874 million boeing co 5398 million united 
technologies credit corp 2230 million ibj schroder bank and 
trust co 1956 million american national bank amp trust co 
1276 million rollsroyce credit corp 589 million marriott 
corp 105 million atampt communications 800876 rohr aero 
services and mary shore representing nonunion employees of 
eastern 
shore is an elected representative of a nonunion group called 
peace or positive employee action committee at eastern which union 
officials allege is sponsored by eastern management 
the transport workers union which represents flight attendants 
at eastern was not included on the committee 
twu officials were unavailable for comment on their unions 
exclusion but a representative of the union attending the 
creditors meeting was visibly annoyed and voiced his objection to 
jones 
all three unions at eastern had requested that they be 
represented on the creditors committee and the airline itself had 
endorsed the idea on tuesday

whitecollar crimes not poor economic 
conditions or deregulation are the root cause of the savings and 
loan crisis congressional auditors said wednesday 
the general accounting office told the house judiciary 
committees criminal justice subcommittee that it had examined 26 
insolvent thrift insitutions in eight states and found evidence of 
fraud or abusive insider dealing in each 
while the survey was skewed to sampls with the worst problems the 
26 represented 60 percent of total losses sustained by the 
governments insurance fund from 1985 through 1987 the pattern of 
fraud and abuse among all failed thrifts clearly is pervasive 
gao officials said 
the huge losses which will ultimately be passed to the nations 
taxpayers estimated at 100 billion to 150 billion did not 
come about primarily because of economic conditions or 
deregulation assistant gao comptroller general frederick wolf 
told the subcommittee 
the bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failure 
by management of a minority of the industry to follow basic prudent 
business practices including the establishment of effective systems 
of internal control wolf said 
asked if that is a crime wolf said violation of fiduciary 
responsibilites to operate in a sound manner is clearly a criminal 
issue 
the gao said it found inadequate records and controls at all 26 
of the failed thrifts it examined in detail excessive loans to one 
borrower at 23 of them conflicts of interest among officers or 
directors at 20 and excessive salaries and benefits at 17 
the subcommittees chairman rep charles e schumer dny 
complained that of the 11000 sampl cases the federal home loan bank 
board has referred to the justice department in the last two years 
for criminal prosecution less than 200 have resulted in convictions 
ten billion dollars would go a long way to housing the 
homeless feeding the poor educating the public caring for the 
sick schumer said instead it has been wasted on lavish parties 
jets real estate travel and meals at the expense of taxpayers 
attorney general dick thornburgh last month blamed fraud and 
insider abuses for 25 percent to 30 percent of the sampl failures 
industry regulators said they have found the crimes a factor in 
at least 70 percent of insolvent institutions 
of the 26 failed thrifts examined by the gao the bank board had 
referred 19 of them and allegations against 182 people to the 
justice department for suspected violations of criminal conspiracy 
theft fraud and embezzlement statutes 
as of this month wolf said 23 of those people had been 
convicted at least 11 after pleading guilty and 19 more were 
under indictment two people were acquitted in trials 
of those convicted 15 were sentenced to prision but the 
sentences generally were suspended with probation wolf said 
the gao did not name the 26 sampls it examined saying some of them 
are still open or the individuals whose names had been referred to 
the justice department for criminal investigation 
we are prohibited by law from disclosing the names of open 
banks we review and as a matter of longstanding policy we treat 
thrifts in the same manner wolf said 
he said the gao also is sensitive to the effect such 
disclosures could have on the governments effort to seek recoveries 
in civil suits or to prosecute alleged criminal acts 
at a separate hearing federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan said his agency is working closely with the treasury 
department to develop a detailed plan for handling the billions of 
dollars in real estate the government will inherit from failed sampls 
greenspan who would be a member of the oversight board of the 
government entity set up to dispose of the real estate declined to 
provide details of the plan to a house banking subcommittee 
some members of congress are worried that government dumping 
of sampl property at firesale prices will ruin regional real 
estate markets particularly in the southwest 
treasury and white house officials are considering a proposal 
developed by rt mcnamar a california investment banker and a 
former deputy treasury secretary that would spend state and federal 
funds to pay for holding onto foreclosed real estate for as long as 
10 or 15 years

a federal appeals court upheld wednesday a 
preliminary injunction barring a 57 billion hostile takeover of 
consolidated gold fields plc by south africalinked minorco sa 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruling which prevents 
minorco from proceeding with its offer for gold fields said the 
proposed takeover would likely violate us antitrust laws 
the appeals court also ruled that the minorco bid should go back 
to a lower court for consideration of whether it violates us 
securities laws 
the court noted that minorco through its various holdings is 
the largest producer of gold in the noncommunist world accounting 
for 203 percent of all gold production in the western world 
while gold fields a british firm is the free worlds 
secondlargest gold concern 
last fall minorco which is largely controlled by two south 
african corporations anglo american corp of south africa and de 
beers consolidated mines ltd launched a hostile takeover bid in 
britain for consolidated gold fields minorco a luxembourg 
corporation holds nearly 30 percent of gold fields shares 
gold fields has resisted the offer and also filed an antitrust 
action in new york 
the company also claimed minorco violated the antifraud 
provisions of us securities laws for allegedly making and false 
and misleading statements about how much control south african 
corporations and individuals have over it 
the oppenheimer family of south africa indirectly controls 
minorco anglo american and debeers and the stigma of south africas 
apartheid racial policy could make it difficult to conduct business 
in some countries gold fields said 
gold fields has significant gold mining holdings in south africa 
australia and the united states including 90 percent of newmont 
gold the largest gold producer in the country 
the company accounts for 12 percent of the western worlds gold 
production making it the secondlargest gold producer in the 
noncommunist world according to court papers 
gold fields usbased newmont subsidiary claimed that because 
it costs more to mine and produce gold in south africa than america 
minorco eventually would shut down us operations once the takeover 
was accomplished 
newmonts claim is that its ability to compete in the 
marketplace will be reduced by anticompetitive influence exercised 
from inside its own boardroom wrote circuit judge jon o newman 
in a 25page opinion 
late last year us district judge michael mukasey issued a 
preliminary injunction preventing minorco anglo american and 
debeers from proceeding with their tender offer until the antitrust 
issue is resolved in the courts 
newmonts threatened injury is precisely the type that the 
antitrust laws were designed to protect against the 2nd circuit 
said in upholding mukasey 
but mukasey claiming a lack of jurisdiction rejected a gold 
fields claim that it was entitled to sue in us courts because of 
its us investors alleging violations of federal securities law 
antifraud provisions 
about 25 percent of gold fields outstanding shares are held by 
us citizens 
the 2nd circuit panel said the tender offer had sufficient 
effects within the united states to warrant application of american 
securities laws and sent that issue back to mukasey for further 
hearings 
in a dissenting opinion circuit judge frank x altimari 
disagreed with the decision granting a takeover target standing to 
challenge its takeover as a violation of the antitrust laws 
but altimari said he agreed with newman and circuit judge wilfred 
feinberg on the other issues
