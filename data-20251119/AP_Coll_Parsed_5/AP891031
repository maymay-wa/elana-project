playfully and masterfully julia child seduced 
america into the kitchen in the 1960s now finally she is back 
seasoned oh so slightly by the health fanatics but as spicy and 
devoted to the joys of the table as ever 
to much of america she is the french chef they know and love 
trilling bon appetit at the close of her landmark tv cooking 
lessons and willing to be a little like us by occasionally dropping 
a piece of chicken live on television and putting it back in the 
pan 
mastering the art of french cooking in two volumes became 
mandatory for serious cooks and julia child became etched in our 
culture her voice her 6foot2 frame and her funny charming 
presence even noncooks know dan aykroyds parody on saturday 
night live she found it terribly funny 
now at 77 she has published her seventh and she says last 
book with the nononsense title the way to cook and a 
nononsense price of 50 with more than 800 recipes in 511 pages 
it weighs in at a very serious 5 pounds it is the first cookbook 
chosen as a main selection by book of the month club 
i felt it was time for a new book and a new look she said 
in a recent interview mastering was very classical french no 
deviating at all 
the way deviates blending classic technique with freestyle 
american cooking 
aimed at a generation for whom cooking may mean lean cuisine 
in the microwave the way to cook includes such things as 
chinese manicotti which she calls an italosino conversation 
piece and unusually good eating 
but this is by no means a new world of food while there are 
plenty of lowfat recipes theres no shortage of butter or cream 
or the egg that perfect pristine primal object we may not 
gobble it up as profusely now as we used to but every mouthful 
should be memorable 
and that is the essence of her attitude toward the fervor over 
healthy eating give up nothing eat with pleasure but in 
moderation 
she bemoans the loss of those happy days in the 60s when 
everyone ate butter and cream oh they were lovely days 
child says she has had to watch her weight for the last 35 years 
i am very careful about my fat content and calories and eat 
much smaller portions i am conscious of not wanting to be a mrs 
6by6 
but that does not mean a lack of good food or good company 
the main thing is getting people together said child who 
first learned to cook so she could feed her husband i get very 
depressed when i dont eat well and that doesnt mean fancy 
americans approach to food these days has her worried 
whats dangerous and discouraging about this era is that 
people really are afraid of their food sitting down to dinner is a 
trap not something to enjoy people should take their food more 
seriously learn what you can eat and enjoy it thoroughly 
in a discussion of the nutrients in vegetables she writes of 
nervous nutritional nellies who boil sprouts or green beans in 
a small covered pan rather than lots of water the results she 
writes are invariably unappetizing inedible and a dull 
graygreen one reason i am sure that many people hate vegetables 
is because theyre cooked like medicine but fresh vegetables are 
glorious food 
child is foremost a teacher though she says she would have been 
happy as a butcher and is proud of her puff pastry method and of 
the work shes done with poultry and bread 
in the way to cook published this month by alfred a knopf 
child teaches the book is demanding but accessible without 
recipes like the daunting 13 pages for french bread in the second 
volume of mastering 
the color photographs show the food as the cook sees it and 
there are plenty of them nine for example show stepbystep how 
to truss a chicken and nine take the cook from a pile of butter 
and flour to puff pastry 
its really sort of a distillation of her whole career said 
peter kump of kumps new york cooking school shes expressing 
herself more clearly more ably in a way that i think is just 
superlative 
and like a great teacher child anticipates questions when she 
suggests creaming butter with a wooden spoon she adds you can 
use a handheld mixer but its such a nuisance to scrape the 
butter out of the blades 
recipes are grouped unconventionally by technique so for 
example pork and veal chops are together rather than pork chops 
and pork roast the croutons for fish soups are with the soups not 
the breads there are master recipes and then variations 
i want to encourage them to think of their own ways child 
said and while she has little patience for fads its as though 
people didnt dare do anything traditional the master recipe 
method allows for adding the trendy ingredient de jour 
modern appliances like the food processor are used but child 
has not been won over to the microwave oven which she uses for 
defrosting rewarming or starting dishes but leaves her too little 
control over actual cooking 
she does however suggest using a blowtorch a blowtorch 
a blowtorch is not just for laughs it is a legitimate 
kitchen tool and marvelous for loosening aspics from their 
molds she even suggests what kind to buy

and who but julia child could get away with explaining yeast 
dough in terms of burps the main ingredients of flour are starch 
and gluten its the starch in the dough that feeds upon the yeast 
belching forth gas that pushes up the gluten 
child nurtures you through breadbaking explaining how yeast 
works what flour to buy what kneading is all about photographs 
make it clear just how the dough should look along the way 
and how can anyone resist trying a souffle when she writes 
the souffle is undoubtedly the egg at its most magnificent 
the egg in all its puffing power how impressive is the chocolate 
or cheese souffle its head rising dramatically out of its dish 
and swaying ever so slightly as it is borne to the table 
in a bow to health she includes cream soups made with 
pureed rice but she also suggests adding heavy or sour cream if 
you like she also offers a fatfree heavensent poached 
chicken and recommends a castiron grill to cook meat without fat 
but she writes i for one would rather swoon over a few thin 
slices of prime beefsteak or one small serving of chocolate 
mousee or a sliver of foie gras than indulge to the full on such 
nonentities as fatfree gelatin puddings 
child grew up in pasadena calif in a home with a hired cook 
and did not take a cooking lesson until she was in her 30s 
she graduated from smith college in 1934 and after writing 
advertising copy for a short time joined the office of strategic 
services the forerunner of the cia she was sent off as a clerk to 
ceylon now sri lanka where she met paul child a career diplomat 
10 years her senior in 1943 
they married in 1946 and remain very close she often talks in 
terms of we he recently moved to a nursing home near their 
cambridge mass home they have no children 
they just never came she said matteroffactly i would 
be very happy to be a grandmother at this point but in addition 
to her book child is busy these days working to improve the status 
of food professionals through the american institute of wine and 
food which she cofounded and the james beard foundation in new 
york 
two years after their marriage the childs were sent to paris 
where she enrolled at the cordon bleu cooking school she was 
considered a bit odd by her friends who all had hired help in the 
kitchen 
id been looking for my lifes work all along and when i got 
into cooking i found it i was inspired by the tremendous 
seriousness with which they took it 
in france she also met simone beck and louisette bertholle who 
needed an american collaborator for the first volume of mastering 
the art of french cooking nine years in the making it was 
published in 1961 with a foreword that began this is a book for 
the servantless american cook who can be unconcerned on occasion 
with budgets waistlines time schedules childrens meals the 
parentchauffeurden mother syndrome or anything else which might 
interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to 
eat 
and it ends above all have a good time 
two years later when child was 51 wgbh in boston launched 
the french chef series and for 206 meals she entertained and 
cajoled and encouraged viewers to do as she did 
i happened to be the right woman at the right time she said 
with modesty noting that john f kennedy had a french chef at the 
white house and more americans were traveling abroad 
suddenly people began considering food with a capital f 
besides she was fun to watch perhaps partly because of the 
onair disasters the first of which occurred with an apple 
charlotte 
as i was looking it did a slow collapse you could hear the 
tears in my voice to cover she told viewers you dont want 
it too stiff 
but the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs and made 
her more familiar 
and since its the good company that counts her advice to 
others who make mistakes dont apologize ever its very bad to 
apologize because people will say that wasnt very good was it

jerzy rudzinski took one look at the 
soviet memorial at katyn dedicated to victims of fascism polish 
officers shot by the nazis in 1941 
then the 53yearold sculptor turned away bitterly quickly 
climbed 15 feet up a pine tree and nailed in a small wooden plaque 
inscribed with his fathers name and true date of death 1940 
uniformed and plainclothes soviet police watched him from afar 
but did nothing 
rudzinski one of the relatives of the 4300 murdered polish 
officers whose deaths in this russian forest have been wrapped in 
mystery and lies for more than 45 years was part of the largest 
group of poles ever allowed to go to katyn 
for the first time the family members were able to mourn them 
in the secluded wood where according to the weight of historical 
evidence the young officers the elite of their generation were 
shot in the back of the head and stacked into mass graves by the 
soviet secret police known then as the nkvd 
more than 15000 polish officers deported to three camps in the 
soviet union in 1939 after the outbreak of world war ii were never 
heard from again after the spring of 1940 the katyn bodies were 
found by the germans in 1943 traces of the 11000 other men have 
never been located 
relatives of the victims accounted for most of the 468 poles who 
boarded a special train organized by a polish state tourist agency 
for a chance to spend several hours in the forest monday 
poles dont want those graves to be anonymous because we know 
the names rudzinski said these are not unknown soldiers but 
the russians dont allow us to personify the deaths 
i wanted to climb the tree to put up a symbol high so that 
they wouldnt be able to take it down so easily he said 
seeing rudzinski iwona mlokosiewicz hurried over and asked him 
also to nail in a brass plaque for her father that she knows only 
from old photographs 
my mother received one card she was pregnant when my father 
left so he probably didnt even know i was born when he died 
said mlokosiewicz holding a bag of dirt from the forest for her 
77yearold mother who couldnt make the trip 
other visitors also scooped dirt and small trees to take home 
the soviet union maintains the men were murdered by the nazis in 
1941 most poles and western historians based on an international 
red cross investigation and other inquiries have long concluded 
the soviet secret police committed the crime in april or may of 
1940 
with poland in the soviet orbit after world war ii it was 
impossible to speak openly in poland about soviet responsibility 
until the 1980s when the birth of solidarity ushered in a period 
of openness 
even so it was not until this year that the polish side of a 
joint polishsoviet historical commission set up in 1987 by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski conceded there is no reasonable doubt the soviets were 
responsible 
katyn remains an emotional wound for poles an obstacle to 
reconciliation and a major source of polish mistrust of the soviets 
many in the group became irritable when the train was late and 
the guides told them to stay in the train at smolensk until they 
boarded the buses for katyn about 17 miles away the presence of a 
police car that led the buses also upset them tension built when 
someone saw a statue of josef stalin along the route 
we are very nervous it is our first time here for the past 
50 years my mother promised that before she died she would lay 
flowers for her brother at katyn said jozef skotnicki a zoo 
director who accompanied his 82yearold mother and an aunt 
once there the poles walked to the memorial a 45footlong 
chesthigh polished stone wall set in a grove of pine and birch 
trees 
a solidarity sticker quickly was used to fasten a piece of paper 
with the letters nkvd on it over the word nazi on the monument 
tears streaming down her face one woman stood motionless behind 
the monument holding a candle in the shape of 1940 with a 
lighted wick on each numeral 
hundreds of other candles were lighted dozens of wreaths laid 
a polish flag planted in the damp soil and a table set up for a 
mass in front of a wooden cross at least one man broke down and 
was carried to an ambulance brought to cope with those overcome 
with emotion 
there was one soviet broadcaster present who had mixed results 
trying to conduct interviews in russian 
go away one pole told him 
its high time this thing is regulated by our countries and 
you can start by saying this deed was done by the nkvd another 
said 
many said they hope the soviets will acknowledge the nkvds 
guilt by the time polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki visits 
moscow on nov 23 
the fate of every lie is that sooner or later it will be 
revealed rudzinski said 
last week in warsaw soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze said the soviet union was committed to establishing 
the truth but a soviet admission of responsibility could lead to 
compensation claims and even homicide trials for those still alive 
who may have taken part in the massacre 
for now poles intend to take advantage of the new opportunities 
to travel to the site since gorbachev assumed power 
it seems to me that this will become a traditional place of 
pilgrimage said maria kowalska who came on her own in the 
spring and served as a guide this time for another chance to pay 
tribute to her father who lies somewhere in the forest

parking a pickup truck in the driveway is against 
the law in swanky flossmoor and a resident truck owner unhappy 
with the restriction is making a federal case out of it 
supporters of the ordinance which banishes pickups to owners 
garages say the trucks are unsightly and dont belong out in plain 
sight in their upperclass south chicago suburb 
jim minx contends the village is snobby and its ordinance 
unconstitutional 
if i pay taxes on my property why can i not park my truck in 
my driveway asks minx whose lawsuit seeking to overturn the law 
is pending in us district court 
its just that they say that it creates a slum environment and 
gives the village a bluecollar image minx said tuesday in a 
telephone interview 
some folks dont have garages he noted he does but there 
isnt room in it for his black mazda pickup 
people have been told either sell your truck sell your 
home or park your truck outside town and walk back to your 
house said minx a 30yearold state lawenforcement officer who 
moved to flossmoor a year ago 
we feel its a violation of civil rights said minx whose 
truck owners rights association has 35 resident members 
the lawsuit filed in march argues that minxs constitutional 
right to use his own property is being violated according to 
richard hutchison minxs attorney a judge is expected to rule 
nov 20 on the villages contention that the matter should really 
be decided in state courts hutchison said 
at issue is a zoning ordinance in the largely residential 
village of 8500 that says residents who own pickups must park them 
in the garage at all times not in the driveway or in front of 
their homes 
plumbers and other tradespeople may park commercial pickups 
temporarily in driveways of homes where they are working but may 
not leave the same vehicles in their own driveways 
offenders are ticketed 10 for each violation and minx says he 
owes 200 in fines on his truck 
the ordinance is an amended version thanks largely to the 
efforts of minx and 165 supporters who signed his petition of a 
decadesold measure that said residents couldnt even keep trucks 
in their garages 
richard rosenthal a commercial land broker vehemently supports 
the original law he photographs offending trucks and reports them 
to the police department said minx who calls rosenthal a snob 
i dont care what he thinks but dont come to my community 
and try to debase it with his damn truck said rosenthal 58 
ive lived in flossmoor 32 years i moved to the community 
because it was beautiful quiet upperclass and ive seen it 
weakened by socalled liberal attitudes he said 
if they want a pickup truck and theres an ordinance in the 
village that says you cannot have one on your property then go 
live somewhere else rosenthal said 
the ordinance amended by village trustees in may is aimed at 
banishing unsightly commercial vehicles from village streets said 
mayor frank maher 
were trying to retain the integrity of the neighborhood he 
said its not a matter of being snobbish 
but what about minxs argument that his truck is his only means 
of transportation and not a commercial vehicle 
thats a real difficult point to define maher said 
if a guys in the cement business and hes got three 
wheelbarrows in the back of his pickup but uses it primarily 
for transportation the village still doesnt want it parked out 
in the open the mayor said

the other demonstration in 
prague last week was staged by the society for happier present 
times a merry crew of a few dozen czechs whose past exploits 
include floating an artificial whale on the vltava river and 
staging a run for political prisoners 
their cause this time was as dear to czechoslovaks as the 
democracy desired by the 10000 who marched through prague streets 
on saturday 
with a frivolous display they wanted to voice the popular anger 
over the new 100crown 10 note a garish green bill which bears 
a portrait of klement gottwald the first communist president 
in the best czech tradition of getting even by poking fun this 
note is the butt of the latest pranks in prague 
some wit figured out that if you folded the note a certain way 
klement gottwald looks just like steven spielbergs et 
another bill seen in recent days had a small swastika etched on 
gottwalds forehead

the many foreigners staying in beautiful zlata praha or 
golden prague last weekend included western correspondents the 
communist authorities blamed for saturdays protest 
others were foreign provocateurs among the 355 detained when 
hundreds of helmeted riot police swarmed through the picturesque 
streets to break up the march 
a third group was the scores of western travel agents in the 
golden city for a congress intended to boost the official drive for 
more hard currency tourism 
some of these visitors were astonished on saturday afternoon 
when whitehelmeted riot police swinging batons ran into hotel 
lobbies pursuing an american and a west german camera crew filming 
the violent end to the demonstration 
outside a banner fluttered proclaiming welcome to the 
congress delegates

while westerners see czechoslovakia as the odd man out in an 
eastern europe bubbling with revolutionary change the needy 
comrade citizens of neighboring east bloc nations know the place as 
a consumer paradise 
bulgarians their many bags bursting with czechoslovak plenty 
block the path to customs at prague airport on almost any day 
hundreds of poles can be seen selling an assortment of goods on the 
black market they spend the cash at wellstocked food stores 
before returning to poland 
czechoslovakias government which knows that its relative 
consumer plenty cannot be maintained forever in a stagnating 
economy fired the first shot last fall in an east bloc customs 
war designed to halt this foreign plundering of the shops 
restrictions were imposed on the export of everything from tea 
to mopeds 
it worked but evidently not well enough so last week the 
communists took more steps to protect their consumers a vast list 
was issued of things that could now be exported only with express 
permission 
some of the items catching the attention of the customs 
officials baffled even those czechs accustomed to daily mangling of 
their language by bureaucrats what they pondered is a juice 
meter and why would anybody need or seek permission to export 
one

the weight of bureaucracy last week fell on eva stolbova a 
literature teacher who also is a member of the democratic 
initiative one of the more flourishing independent groups 
beginning to bud in czechoslovakia 
mrs stolbova was summoned to bartolomeska for a meeting with 
the secret police 
she later recounted some details of the session like other 
dissidents she found that much police interest focuses these days 
on vaclav havel the banned playwright and a prominent government 
critic 
havel himself has reported that the authorities who have banned 
his work for the last 20 years now seem anxious to rehabilitate him 
as a writer if he will just stop his political activity 
as mrs stolbova recounted her chat with police segments of 
havels 1960s play the garden party made their first 
reappearance on an official prague stage in 20 years along with 
songs by the banned folksingerheroine of the prague spring 
marta kubisova and writings by emigre authors milan kundera and 
josef skvorecky 
the censors were not amused having permitted the performance 
they then demanded so many changes that the actors refused to go on 
stage 
unlucky ticket holders turned back from the theater joined glum 
bruised demonstrators on pragues streets saturday night 
but most czechs seemed to be having a much jollier time whiling 
away the weekend in their country cottages or savoring beer and the 
latest witticism in smokefilled pubs 
on wenceslas square where police sirens had wailed hours 
before discos blared electronic rhythm into the street other 
teenagers true to bourgeois traditions that have survived decades 
of communism donned shiny suits and best dresses and took off to 
demonstrate their dancing skills at the social seasons first balls

a gunman wearing a yellow mask shot the son 
of philadelphias imprisoned mob boss tuesday night as he was 
dining at an italian restaurant police said 
nicodemo scarfo jr 24 was in stable condition late tuesday at 
thomas jefferson university hospital according to hospital 
spokesman steve brown 
doctors determined that scarfo was shot at least four times 
once in the neck and the left arm and in each side of his chest 
brown said 
witnesses said a man wearing a yellow mask and black clothes 
walked up to scarfo in the bar of dante and luigis restaurant in 
south philadelphia at 715 pm and shot him at least five times 
according to police 
he was shot once in the right neck and at least once in each 
side of his chest police said 
officers said they found a semiautomatic gun outside the 
restaurant 
the gunman was like greased lightning said joseph oberman 
who was dining in the restaurants main room he came in and out 
of the door 
after the shot nobody moved oberman said 
but another diner remembered the aftermath differently 
the dining room was in chaos said fran tosconi 
at least two dozen men have died in the past eight years in the 
struggle for control of the philadelphiaarea mob 
but assistant us attorney joel friedman of the philadelphia 
strike force speculated late tuesday that tuesdays shooting was 
not part of a renewed mob war but a punishment to the elder scarfo 
for gangsters whove agreed to testify in the past several years 
many of the other important members and leaders of the la 
cosa nostra are currently cooperating and testififying friedman 
said that could be deemed an embarrassing situation for nicodemo 
scarfo as the leader 
there would be many out there that would wish to punish scarfo 
for the lack of discipline within his family he said 
the elder scarfo known by the nickname of little nicky has 
been imprisoned since his indictment in 1986 in a 1 million 
extortion attempt he was convicted in the extortion attempt and

sullivan has declined to make the decision on whether to end a ban 
on research using fetal tissue the washington post said in 
wednesday editions 
that puts the decision in the hands of an assistant secretary 
james o mason an opponent of abortion who opposes such research 
the newspaper did not say why sullivan had declined to make the 
decision and some officials said they had not been informed that it 
would be masons issue to decide 
conservative supporters of the bush administration have promised 
a firestorm of protest if the administration lifts the ban

of a decision to give the issue to his boss 
i know nothing of it said press officer campbell gardett 
a sullivan robert schmermund would say only the final 
decision is under review he declined further comment 
fetal tissue is believed by many scientists to offer important 
advantages in research on parkinsons disease and other disorders 
but masons predecessor as assistant secretary for health 
robert windom last year forbade use of government funds to finance 
such research and established a special advisory committee on 
whether it should continue 
later last year the committee recommended the ban be lifted 
sullivan had been expected to make the decision himself on 
whether to accept the committees recommendation and resume the use 
of fetal tissue in research

adolf hitlers list of people to be executed in 
the event of a successful invasion of britain is now a book 
the black book discovered in 1945 after the defeat of 
germany in world war ii listed 2820 top people to be wiped out 
including prime minister winston churchill and anthony eden the 
foreign minister 
some of the prominent britons on the list gathered tuesday at 
londons imperial war museum where one of two known copies of the 
list is kept the other is in the united states 
the book gives the address of each target as well as details of 
trade unions and other organizations to be eradicated 
one target 92yearold author naomi mitchison said she went 
and talked over her predicament with a fisherman when she 
discovered from government contacts in 1940 that she was on a list 
of people to be executed 
he said i shouldnt worry because they would take me away to 
america on a fishing boat provided they could get the fuel mrs 
mitchison said i thought that a bit unlikely and dangerous at 
the time but i was very upset 
poet sir stephen spender 80 said i felt honored to be in 
it leonard woolf virginia woolfs husband and i had a suicide 
pact because it was obvious we would be on a hit list we didnt 
actually do anything more about it its a good job we won 
when novelist rebecca west learned after the books discovery 
that she was on the list with noel coward she wrote the playwright 
saying my dear the people we should have been dead with 
one blunder is the inclusion of sigmund freud who died in 1938 
playwright lord willis who is also on the death list said a 
mistake like that disproves the german image of efficiency

american and soviet women have made gains in 
the workplace but remain concentrated in lowerpaying jobs as they 
struggle to balance family and career speakers at a ussoviet 
conference said tuesday 
we really have differences in the status of women in our 
societies but all in all i think we have more problems in common 
than differences said former vice presidential candidate 
geraldine ferraro 
ms ferraro actress marlo thomas and a soviet expert spoke on 
womens issues at the fifth general chautauqua conference on 
ussoviet relations 
ms thomas said american women once were relegated to keeping 
house or holding lowpaying jobs 
ah those were the days sigh certain americans she said 
unfortunately some of them are in the congress or the capitol 
soviet women comprise about 52 percent of the work force in that 
country said alevtina v fedulova first deputy chairman of the 
committee of soviet women a nongovernmental group of womens 
councils 
women comprise 44 percent of the american work force ms 
ferraro said 
mrs fedulova said many soviet women make less than men because 
they tend to hold jobs requiring less skill and even in more 
skilled professions advance more slowly than men 
men get better wages because given the same educational 
background men have a higher professional status she said 
mrs fedulova said women have made strides in the fields of 
medicine education and electronics sixtyseven percent of the 
soviets physicians are women she said 
on another subject mrs fedulova said access to sex education 
and contraceptives must improve in the soviet union where abortion 
is the main means of birth control 
the situation with contraceptives in the ussr is as bad as 
the situation with computers that is very bad said fedulova 
contraceptives are not widely available 
western experts have estimated the average soviet woman has nine 
abortions during her childbearing years 
we have to educate people mrs fedulova said in an 
interview through an interpreter what we really need to make the 
woman understand is the need to preserve her health and at the 
same time she should have the resources to do that 
abortion is not a benefit to any woman because it is a blow to 
her health mrs fedulova said a woman should be taught to 
avoid abortion 
about 200 soviet delegates including 20 soviet journalists are 
attending the conference which is sponsored by the university of 
pittsburgh and chautauqua institution in western new york 
in another conference session tuesday a soviet scientist and 
american official called for increased cooperation between the two 
countries to fight global warming depletion of the earths ozone 
layer and other environmental problems 
the world has no time left to solve these problems said 
boris n laskorin deputy director of the allunion scientific 
research institute of chemical technology 
alan hecht deputy assistant administrator of the environmental 
protection agencys office of international activities said 
improved relations between the two countries already has resulted 
in joint projects

a former lieutenant governor was charged 
tuesday with violating the states campaign finance act by making 
excessive contributions to gov mike hayden 
former lt gov david c owen a former state senator and 
longtime political aide of sen bob dole rkan was charged with 
11 counts of exceeding campaign contribution limits by 26500 and 
making donations of 34000 in the names of others 
he also was charged by special prosecutors with four counts of 
theft and one count each of criminal solicitation conspiracy and 
making a false writing 
owen said he found it appropriate that this witch hunt 
culminated on halloween and charged the investigation was 
politically motivated 
he said he did not intentionally violate the law and pledged a 
vigorous defense to exonerate himself and establish the 
motives of everyone involved in this investigation 
the charges stem from allegations by the kansas public 
disclosure commission that owen funneled money into haydens 1986 
election campaign in excess of donation limits in effect at the 
time 
also charged were john e palmer an overland park businessman 
and elliot m kaplan a kansas city mo attorney palmer was 
named in one count of conspiracy while kaplan was charged with one 
count of theft and one count of conspiracy to commit theft 
three persons were named as unindicted coconspirators and 
granted immunity in exchange for their testimony including owens 
wife beverly 
owen ran unsuccessfully for governor of kansas in 1982 he was a 
national fundraiser for dole in his bid for the 1988 republican 
presidential nomination but media disclosures about owens 
involvement in the hayden contribution case and owens business 
dealings prompted him to resign from the dole campaign in january 
1988 
in their report special prosecutors michael barbara and thomas 
haney said they had not attempted to determine what knowledge 
hayden had of the allegedly illegal donations 
hayden issued a statement saying the report exonerated him and 
his staff 
all 18 felony and misdemeanor counts were filed against him in 
johnson county district court in olathe

four people shouting burn baby burn set 
fire monday to three american flags on the steps of the us 
capitol in an attempt to force a court test on the 
constitutionality of a new law banning flag desecration 
we defy your law said spokeswoman nancy kent 
we challenge you arrest us test your statute take it back 
to the supreme court and try once again to claim it is all 
consistent with your constitutional standards of free speech 
one of those arrested was gregory joey johnson whose 1984 
arrest for burning a flag at the republican national convention in 
dallas set in motion the court case that led to the new law 
another was scott tyler 24 who stirred controversy in chicago 
earlier this year by placing a flag on the floor as part of a 
student exhibit at the school of the art institute 
capitol police charged johnson 33 of richmond ind tyler and 
two others with violating the flag protection act of 1989 
demonstrating without a permit and disorderly conduct said police 
spokesman dan nichols 
the other two were identified as shawn eichner 24 of new york 
city and david blalock 39 of johnstown pa 
coincidentally the 1984 flag burning charge against johnson was 
officially dismissed on monday by dallas county criminal judge john 
hendrik who acted after receiving the official order from the 
texas court of criminal appeals ordering him to do so 
the demonstration came two days after members of a radical 
vietnam veterans group in seattle wash burned a fullsize 
american flag and 1000 paper flags to protest the law 
president bush who favors a constitutional amendment to protect 
the flag allowed the measure to become law without his signature 
it went into effect at 1201 am saturday 
it provides punishment of up to one year in jail and a 1000 
fine for anyone who knowingly mutilates defaces physically 
defiles burns maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon 
any flag of the united states 
the supreme court sparked the controversy earlier this year by 
declaring an existing law aimed at protecting the flag to be an 
unconstitutional intrusion on free speech johnson had been 
convicted under that law 
flags were burned in several cities shortly after the new law 
went into effect us attorney mike mckay said in seattle that the 
fbi is investigating the flag burning there to determine if a 
criminal complaint is warranted 
mondays flagburning had been scheduled for in front of the 
supreme court but organizers led photographers and television 
cameras to the capitol steps 
one demonstrator produced a flag and ripped it in two two 
police officers struggled with him and tore the pieces of the 
banner from his hands 
behind them another man produced a flag and set it afire 
two other flags also were set ablaze crumbling into bits of 
charred cloth as the four demonstrators chanted burn baby 
burn burn baby burn 
one shouted stop the fascist flag law oppose it 
im a vietnam veteran and i am burning this flag said 
another we saw what this country is 
police tried to extinguish the flames by stamping on the flags 
then aimed fire extinguishers at the burning remnants dousing them 
in a chemical stream and shrouding the scene in white smoke 
this law enshrines the american flag as a sacred symbol above 
criticism miss kent read from a prepared statement we refuse 
to be silent in the face of such an attempt by the government to 
dictate the bounds of speech protest and artistic expression 
david cole a staff attorney for the center for constitutional 
rights who has represented johnson said the new statute is just 
as unconstitutional as the old law

dame vera lynn the allied forces sweetheart is 
leading a campaign for increased pensions for world war ii widows 
dame vera who received her title for entertaining troops said 
she feels strongly that the law must be changed to give world war 
ii widows the same pension as women who lost husbands in later 
battles 
defense ministry rules give wives of servicemen killed after 
1973 a second pension on top of their war widows pension 
world war ii widows receive about 100 a week while those who 
qualify for the second pension get about 220 
the government says increasing pensions for world war ii widows 
would cost 320 million a year 
the cost is irrelevant said dame vera 70 they gave 
their lives the wives gave their husbands and the fathers of their 
children so whatever it costs they should have it

dick and beth pratts dairy cows always go 
to bed with the morning newspaper they sleep on it 
the pratt farm tucked along the shores of lake champlain about 
30 miles south of burlington is one of at least a dozen in the 
state where dairy cows are snoozing on recycled shredded 
newspapers 
the papers are replacing typical bedding materials like sawdust 
straw hay crushed corn stalks and sand 
its a spectacular market for rural recycling said jerry 
powell editor of resource recycling magazine 
shredded newspapers also are comforting cows in illinois iowa 
michigan minnesota new york ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin 
experts say the trend could be a boon to recyclers who are 
stuck with excess newspapers and farmers who pay high prices for 
traditional bedding materials 
its been an obvious way to combine two problems said will 
gehr a waste management specialist with the vermont department of 
environmental conservation old newspaper is typically the 
highest amount of materials collected at recycling centers 
vermont recently started a campaign to match dairy farmers with 
recycled newspapers gehr said the potential demand by vermonts 
2400 farmers is almost three times greater than the number of 
newspapers distributed in the state 
farmers say a cow will use between 2 and 5 pounds of bedding 
daily a typical newspaper weighs about a pound 
the pratts started with recycled newspapers five years ago at 
the suggestion of an agricultural extension agent 
its just fantastic beth pratt said its far more 
absorbent than anything weve ever used it keeps the animals 
cleaner and it makes them feel good 
dairy farmers now use just a fraction of the newspapers recycled 
in the united states powell said of the 454 million tons 
collected in 1988 only 100000 tons were used by dairy farmers 
but as other bedding prices continue to rise farmers are eyeing 
newspapers as a cheap substitute 
in vermont recycled newspapers are free sawdust and straw sell 
for between 60 and 100 a ton thats 2000 a year in savings for 
the pratts 
the newspapers also may have health benefits for the cows 
several studies say the highlyabsorbing newspapers lower the 
rate of mastitis among dairy cows said robert appleman a dairy 
animal scientist with the university of minnesota mastitis is a 
potentiallyfatal bacterial infection of the cows udders 
universities say there is no danger to the milk supply from cows 
ingesting newspaper newspapers no longer use dangerous heavy 
metals in their inks and the cows only eat a little of the 
newspapers if any at all said terry musson a senior regional 
milk specialist with the us food and drug administration 
there are some drawbacks glossy inserts do not absorb moisture 
staples injure cows shreddings blow easily in the wind and farmers 
often drive to recycling centers and shred the papers themselves 
the pratts cows seem to like their new beds though 
as beth pratt shredded some newspapers on a recent indiansummer 
morning the cows surge toward the confetti 
they love it she said theyll stick their noses in it 
and throw it up in the air they have a good time with it

the bush administration and the soviet union 
are discussing a possible summit meeting as early as december 
perhaps on a ship in the mediterranean to discuss us help in 
transforming the soviet economy the washington post said in 
tuesday editions 
a wellplaced us official while declining to confirm the post 
account said it was on the right track other officials said 
they were under instructions not to discuss the situation 
the meeting between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
president bush would not replace another between the two leaders 
expected next summer as was agreed between secretary of state 
james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
in wyoming last month according to an unidentified administration 
official cited by the post 
the meeting discussed in wyoming would be in the united states 
while the december conference might be in neutral territory the 
official told the newspaper 
among sites he mentioned as a possiblity was a ship in the 
mediterranean 
the purpose of the meeting that baker and shevardnadze agreed to 
work toward was described at the time as arms control 
but a december meeting might concentrate on ways the united 
states could help the soviet union move closer to a market economy 
according to the official 
a white house spokesman roman popadiuk declined to comment on 
the newspaper report 
bush has been criticized by congressional democrats for alleged 
timidity in responding to the fastmoving changes sweeping the 
soviet union and some of its satellite states in eastern europe 
that are resulting in freer societies 
in a recent speech baker said the bush administration was 
prepared to give technical economic help to the soviets and in fact 
us economic officials already have been consulted about technical 
matters on monday bush said he would send a cabinetlevel 
delegation to poland late next month to help the warsaw government 
plan ways to repair its ravaged economy 
gorbachevs economic reforms so far have not improved the 
availability of consumer goods in the soviet union or the 
performance of the soviet economy

despite openheart surgery a messy 
divorce and indictment on corruption charges former premier 
andreas papandreou is a strong contender in sundays national 
elections 
remarkably the charismatic 70yearold socialist and former 
economics professor appears to have held on to his personal support 
at a rally sunday attended by tens of thousands of supporters 
he insisted his party will triumph 
it was not an empty boast three polls this month indicated 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement pasok would retain 
the 39 percent it won in junes election when the conservative new 
democracy party fared better but failed to attain a parliamentary 
majority 
we are talking about victory the forecasts look better every 
day papandreou told the athens daily epikairotita 
actually victory appears far from assured papandreou is going 
into the polls an underdog after winning easy victories in 1981 
and 1985 then losing his party majority in june but no one is 
ruling him out 
papandreous durability is due to several factors political 
astuteness the strong party loyalty of greek voters support from 
farmers and his autocratic rule of pasok and personal charisma 
the most serious difficulty facing papandreou are charges he 
authorized the embezzlement of millions from a private bank and 
instigated a wiretapping network with which he allegedly listened 
in on friends and foes 
in september he was indicted by parliament the first greek 
civilian leader ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing in 
office he and five former ministers are expected to be tried by 
special courts early next year 
papandreou claimes the indictments stem from a conspiracy to 
annihilate him politically 
under the guise of performing a cleanup they settled personal 
and party accounts he told his supporters sunday they 
promoted the defamation of their political rivals 
his defense appears to have worked 
we watched the parliamentary debates on television but no 
one was convinced that papandreou is guilty said nikos 
christonakis a 78yearold retired farmer and pasok supporter on 
crete the governments arguments were unconvincing 
political scientist michalis spourdalakis said the right and 
leftwing parties may not get much advantage from attacking 
papandreou on the scandals 
they failed to understand that you dont dismantle a movement 
which once enjoyed 48 percent of the vote he said a different 
political program is whats needed 
in addition to the scandal charges conservatives and leftists 
accuse papandreou of ruining the economy citing a 58 billion 
deficit 
but farmers who form 25 percent of the working population 
point to improvements in education and health care in the 
countryside and to european economic community agricultural 
subsidies for which they credit the socialists 
papandreou has in the past won support from the left through 
pledging to pull greece out of nato and the eec however he has 
acted pragmatically keeping greece in the eec and negotiating a 
new fiveyear defense accord with the united states in 1983 
spourdalakis says papandreou was able to capitalize on the 
antiamerican sentiments that followed the fall in 1974 of a 
sevenyear military dictatorship that was seen as having enjoyed 
american support 
papandreou promised a new future for greece but also represented 
a link with the past he was a cabinet member in the centrist 
government of his father george who was removed from power in 1965 
spourdalakis says papandreou personifies greeks yearning for 
change in the political system being educated and a technocrat 
he could fulfill the demand for modernization in society politics 
and the economy 
the first serious blow to papandreou came in august of 1988 when 
he left for london urgently for medical treatment he underwent 
openheart surgery that october and was hospitalized again in july 
for pneumonia and kidney failure 
he has a doctor at his side continually but claims that his 
health has not affected his ability to lead 
while in london papandreou went public with his affair with an 
air hostess half his age dimitra liani he was still married to 
his americanborn wife of 38 years margaret a poll conducted 
after the june elections found that pasok had lost 7 percent of its 
women voters 
papandreou married liani in july and neither the opposition nor 
the press have concentrated on his personal life in this campaign 
one of the biggest questions about the elections is what will 
happen if as in june no one gains a majority 
after the june deadlock the new democrats and the communistled 
coalition of the left and progress formed an unprecedented alliance 
with a limited mandate to clean up political life 
having obtained the indictments it sought of papandreou and its 
associates the coalition government resigned oct 7 
the communist coalition said recently tht it would consider 
governing with pasok but only if papandreou were removed

former gov lester maddox said monday he will 
enter the 1990 democratic race for governor in january making good 
on his vow that he would run if no true conservative candidate 
emerged 
maddox released a statement saying his candidacy now appears 
to be a certainty in a telephone interview he said that means 
he plans to run but will make no official announcement until 
january 
asked if anything could change his mind the 74yearold former 
governor said i dont anticipate anything 
maddox announced last year that he would enter the 1990 race if 
no conservative democratic candidate came forward to challenge the 
partys national establishment 
since then lt gov zell miller state rep lauren bubba 
mcdonald and state sen roy barnes have formally entered the 
democratic race for governor and atlanta mayor andrew young has 
indicated he will run on the republican side state rep johnny 
isakson and former superior court judge greeley ellis are in the 
running 
it is true that a number of candidates have announced or 
promised to announce most are men i personally know as good 
men maddox said in his statement however they are all 
followers and captives of the political establishment without 
conservative records and in my judgment could not be elected as a 
democratic candidate for governor of georgia in 1990 
he also said the other candidates would be unable to provide 
the strong and free conservative leadership so badly needed for the 
years ahead in our state 
maddox said he plans to raise his campaign funds from the 
outsiders the average georgians who are fed up with their 
government 
he said he believes he could win the primary a primary runoff 
and the general election with a total warchest of 1 million to 
125 million 
i dont have to have the 15 million theyre going to raise 
3 million or 4 million each he said 
although he has been treated for cancer maddox said his health 
is now fantastic and he doesnt consider himself too old for 
the office ive determined that somewhere between 85 and 90 
people get old he said 
maddox served as governor of georgia from 1967 to 1971 and later 
was lieutenant governor under former gov jimmy carter

fierce winds that pushed flames over 4000 
acres of brushy hillsides diminished monday allowing firefighters 
to surround the wildfire and declare it controlled 
firefighters snuffed out the blaze monday evening and planned 
to remain at the scene until tuesday afternoon to prevent 
flareups said ventura county fire department spokeswoman liz 
pickles 
theres no more smoke no more flames and theyll decide 
tomorrow whether to pull out ms pickles said 
two hundred firefighters most of them using picks and shovels 
to quell hot spots took part in the mopup 
the fire began around 5 am sunday when 50mph winds downed a 
power line igniting the brushy santa monica mountains area 
northwest of malibu 
the fastmoving blaze destroyed two mountaintop homes and three 
other buildings sending residents including entertainer dick 
clark rushing toward the ocean for safety more than 2200 people 
were routed from campsites authorities said 
thick dark smoke from the fire forced closure of the busy 
pacific coast highway the fire could be seen up to 30 miles away 
up to 570 firefighters from los angeles and ventura counties 
battled the blaze as four air tankers and six helicopters bombed a 
twomile front of flames with retardant and water 
residents hosed down the roofs of their homes just north of the 
county line and charred trees and smoldering brush lined the 
coastal highway

an elderly farmer doesnt understand the 
excitement about a bunch of old bones found on his farm but 
scientists say the remains are that of a stagmoose and may provide 
clues about the ice age creatures 
the biddle family on monday gave the state the antlered skull 
identified as that of a cervalces scotti a mooselike animal 
that stood about 12 feet tall weighed about 1700 pounds and ate 
aquatic plants 
john c biddle 73 of elburn 40 miles west of chicago said 
the skull was found five years ago while the family was digging a 
pond in a swampy area further digging turned up no additional 
remains 
the biddles cleaned the skull and put it in the garage where it 
gathered dust for years and was considered nothing more than a 
bunch of old bones 
it meant nothing to us biddle said in a telephone 
interview to us it was just like a white elephant 
interesting to look at but what are you going to do with it 
but officials at the illinois state museum in springfield say 
the skull which has the features of a deer and the flattened 
antlers of a moose is an important find because of the lack of 
information on the species 
the animals roamed the northern part of the continent until 
about 10000 years ago and probably competed with the presentday 
moose and the nowextinct mastodon said jeffrey saunders 
associate geologist at the museum 
the stagmoose found on the biddle farm was an adult male 
because only males have antlers saunders said the beast had very 
long legs like a camel and resembled a giant big deer 
the biddles stagmoose probably was munching on some plants in 
a marshy bog got stuck in the mud and eventually died saunders 
said the rest of the body probably turned to dust while the 
thicker head and antlers survived he said 
the skull will be studied and exhibited at the museum saunders 
said it is the eighth stagmoose fossil found in the state but 
the first one with antlers 
scientists have extracted sediment from the farm and hope to 
perform radiocarbon dating tests on the skull to determine the 
exact age of the animal 
but the biddles say prehistoric moose heads take a back seat to 
the harvest on their 450acre farm 
biddle said his son michael who found the skull decided not 
to attend the formal presentation monday on the family farm 
hes got more important things to do biddle said

an array of religious groups from hare 
krishnas to mainline protestants is siding with television 
evangelist jimmy swaggarts ministry in a supreme court showdown 
over state taxing powers 
the justices today were to hear arguments challenging 
californias taxation of books tapes and other merchandise sold by 
the louisianabased jimmy swaggart ministries 
backing california in the dispute are two organizations not 
usually allied in court the american civil liberties union and 
the national conference of state legislatures 
california court rulings forced swaggarts ministry to pay the 
state 183000 in back taxes and interest for 1974 through 1981 
but lawyers for swaggarts organization say the california tax 
as applied violates religious freedom and due process and unduly 
interferes with interstate commerce 
after hearing from both sides today the nations highest court 
is expected to announce its decision by july 
the disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on retailers 
for the privilege of selling personal property in california and 
on the consumption of products within the state 
the tax was imposed on sales by the swaggart ministry during 
crusades in california and sales made through the mail 
for the years at issue mailorder sales from baton rouge la 
to california consumers totaled 17 million sales of merchandise 
at california crusades totaled 240000 
swaggarts lawyers are relying heavily on a 1943 high court 
ruling that overturned the convictions of jehovahs witnesses who 
violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in 
doortodoor canvassing to get a license and pay a fee 
the jehovahs witnesses were distributing religious literature 
and the 1943 ruling said this form of religious activity 
occupies the same high estate under the constitutions first 
amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the 
pulpits 
but a california appeals court ruled that nondiscriminatory 
taxes levied on sales including sales by religious groups are 
constitutional the california supreme court refused to review 
swaggarts appeal from that ruling 
numerous organizations have filed friend of the court briefs 
in the case 
defending the state tax lawyers for the aclu said the 
constitutional guarantee of religious freedom does not mandate a 
religious exemption from a neutral nondiscriminatory tax on sales 
of tangible property 
providing such an exemption the aclu brief contended would 
violate the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
but lawyers for the national council of churches representing 
most protestant denominations among its members called the 
california tax a serious threat a tax on the dissemination of 
religious messages and thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of 
religion 
a similar brief submitted by the international society for 
krishna consciousness said that group has paid under protest 
nearly 300000 in taxes to california for sales of religious 
literature by its members 
under the hare krishna ritual of sankirtan members are required 
to distribute such literature and solicit money from the public to 
support the religion 
lawyers for a coalition of evangelical ministries argued that if 
the california tax is upheld the door will be wide open for over 
7000 taxing jurisdictions to impose a similar burden on national 
religious ministries 
the case is jimmy swaggart ministries vs board of equalization

dont save a place in your wallet for the 
montana card 
the legislature thought getting a bank to issue cards with a big 
sky country theme would be a dandy way to raise some extra money 
but bankers dont seem to share the enthusiasm 
no financial institution put in a bid to offer a montana card by 
the revenue departments oct 20 deadline 
i honestly dont know what happened jack ellery deputy 
director of operations for the agency said monday i was 
surprised because there was so much interest before 
the ideas sponsor rep mark okeefe got calls from across the 
country about the states plan to offer a socalled affinity 
card 
sponsors of such cards cards get a fee from the banks issuing 
the plastic and in theory the bank gets more customers for its 
cards montana officials who had hoped to bring in 76 million by 
1993 with the idea will decide next month whether to try again 
ellery thinks the bankers may have been put off by the paperwork 
of competitive bidding 
but ed jasmin president of the montana bankers association 
has another explanation montana population 805000 doesnt have 
enough people to make such a venture profitable

playing time with the pirates has been limited he said hes having 
a great time but he added they hit a heck of a lot harder than

the folks who run floridas turnpike have figured a 
way out of a sticky situation 
chewing gum isnt sold anywhere on the roads 309 miles 
especially in the clean new rest stations that dot the length of 
the turnpike 
so many times the gum winds up on the sidewalk on the 
floors under the tables in the carpet said jim butch the 
manager of the lake worth rest station thats the reason 
the new stations opened in september but the gum ban has been 
in effect for two years ever since the marriott corp took control 
of turnpike rest stops 
not everyone is happy with the restriction 
highway patrol lt phil moan stocks the glove compartment of his 
cruiser with gum and packs his own stash when he goes to palm beach 
international airport which has also banned gum sales 
im going to have to become a gumshoe on this and stick to 
it he said

navy officials are questioning the pilot of a 
fighter jet that dropped a 500pound bomb on the guided missile 
cruiser uss reeves blowing a gaping hole in the ships bow and 
injuring five sailors 
the incident which occurred while the cruiser was escorting the 
aircraft carrier uss midway on training operations in the indian 
ocean was the navys second major training accident in as many 
days 
on sunday a student pilot slammed a t2 buckeye into the 
carrier uss lexington killing himself and four members of the deck 
crew during training exercises off florida 
navy spokesmen said the pilot of the singleseat fa18 hornet 
had just taken off from the midway 
the bomb which detonated upon impact blew a fivefoot hole in 
the top deck and set off a small fire in the ships forecastle that 
was quickly extinguished said lt bruce cole a navy spokesman at 
the pentagon 
we dont know yet why it happened said another spokesman 
cmdr mark baker the incident is under investigation 
baker said the pilot was returned to the midway and was being 
questioned by navy officers 
cole said the five sailors received minor injuries as a result 
of flying glass and concussion from the exploding bomb the 
sailors were treated on board the uss reeves he added 
the spokesman said the navy did not plan to release the names of 
the injured until their families were notified 
cole and baker said the aircraft carrier and guided missile 
cruiser were conducting routine weapons training in the indian 
ocean about 32 miles from diego garcia the site of a us base 
cole said the fa18s pilot inadvertently dropped the bomb 
apparently as it passed over its cruiser escort the spokesmen said 
they did not know the altitude of the plane or how far apart the 
two ships were 
although the bomb left a large hole in the deck near the 
cruisers bow it did no damage to the outer hull cole said 
the reeves is described as a nuclear capable ship but the 
navy spokesmen refused to confirm whether nuclear weapons were 
aboard such weapons antisubmarine rockets that are being phased 
out of the navys inventory are usually carried in a forward 
compartment of the ship near where the bomb struck 
the cruiser was returning to the us base at diego garcia under 
its own power baker said 
the mark82 bomb was described as about four feet long and 14 
inches in diameter it is a gravity or freefall bomb and can be 
used against ships at sea land targets or adapted to be used as a 
shrapnel device against humans 
the plane is a jet which can adapt to both the fighter and 
attack roles 
the incident occurred at 906 pm local time cole said 
both the midway which is one of the navys oldest aircraft 
carriers and the reeves are permanently based in yokosuka japan 
the 533foot reeves is a leahy class guided missile cruiser 
displacing 7800 tons fully loaded and carrying 450 officers and 
enlisted men it was commissioned in 1964 
the 980footlong midway displacing 64000 tons at full load 
was commissioned in 1945 and has undergone a number of overhauls 
it carries a crew of approximately 2500 officers and enlisted men 
the accident was at least the sixth aboard a navy ship not 
counting sailors lost overboard since the april 19 turret 
explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa that killed 47 sailors

a paternity suit in detroit a wifebeating allegation in 
cleveland a stock sale in new york all are highprofile issues 
in mayoral elections at a time when voters say they are worried 
about drugs crime homelessness and the quality of schools 
this city faces very large problems said rudolph giuliani 
republican candidate for mayor of new york city but discussion of 
those problems keeps getting shoved aside by juicier stuff in the 
harsh campaign between giuliani and democrat david dinkins 
from the nations largest city to many of its smallest voters 
will elect hundreds of mayors on nov 7 with most incumbents 
facing only token opposition 
there are issueoriented contests in dayton ohio and seattle 
but in other cities with tough races the campaigns accentuate the 
negative and raise unpleasant memories of the worst aspects of the 
1988 presidential race 
the tactics are an extension of 1988 and an example of the 
importance voters give to character as a political issue said 
democratic pollster peter hart 
people vote for people they dont vote for issues said 
republican consultant eddie mahe arguing that an emphasis on 
character rather than position papers makes sense these 
proponents of onesided positive campaigns thats googoo land 
thats a dream world 
drugs are named by many as the biggest problem facing the 
nation but politicians are all proclaiming their opposition to 
drugs and drug dealers a fact that mahe said diminishes it as a 
campaign issue 
it appears negative stuff moves polling numbers and positive 
doesnt said james ruvolo ohio democratic party chairman i 
think theres a mean spirit out there and i think people want to 
believe the worst about politicians 
in ruvolos own back yard is one of the years nastiest mayoral 
races the contest in cleveland between city council president 
george forbes and state sen michael r white 
both finalists in the race to succeed republican mayor george 
voinovich are democrats but their common party affiliation has 
done nothing to diminish the bitterness of the race 
the master of sleaze was whites description of forbes 
slum lord was how forbes characterized white 
white accused forbes operatives of leaking reports that the 
state senator had beaten his first wife and said he was the object 
of a campaign of political terror a short time later whites 
second wife told reporters she had been shoved and beaten 
mary forbes was described as a front person for her 
husbands investments in two radio stations a drivein theater 
and a nursing home 
i respect his wife said forbes i demand he respect my 
wife 
about the time 71yearold coleman young was gearing up to run 
for a fifth term as mayor of detroit he was hit with a paternity 
suit filed by a former city employee but what looked like a golden 
opportunity for youngs opponents faded as an issue when the mayor 
agreed to set up a trust fund for 7yearold joel loving and 
provide for the boy through his 25th birthday 
opponent tom barrow emerged from the september nonpartisan 
primary as youngs challenger and proclaimed you can run 
coleman but you cant hide 
so far young has run quite well and holds a 10point lead in 
polls over the man he beat four years ago barrow has attacked 
youngs leadership during 16 years as mayor hoping voters will 
decide its time for a change 
the citys two major newspapers think it is both the detroit 
news and the detroit free press endorsed barrow 
drugs and crime are issues in dayton where mayor richard clay 
dixon a democrat is challenged by abner orick a republican city 
commissioner 
hes been in office for three years and each year hed been 
in crime has increased substantially said orick 
my records show i have been fighting the war on drugs since i 
became mayor retorted dixon where was abner when we declared 
war he did not mention drugs until he became a candidate 
norm rice a seattle city councilman is favored to become the 
citys first black mayor in a campaign in which an initiative aimed 
at ending mandatory school busing is a major issue doug jewett 
rices republican opponent helped draft the measure 
rice has criticized the initiative for lacking controls to 
prevent the resegregation of schools but also has said lets 
face it doug jewett is not a racist 
even more lowkey is the debate in miami where mayor xavier 
suarez is challenged by armando e lacasa who conceded i do not 
believe i was the best candidate to face suarez hes going to be 
very difficult to beat but we want to send a message to the mayor 
that we are not happy 
no such politeness or modesty was detectable in new york city 
voters are told that dinkins is careless about his finances and 
that giuliani is a cold prosecutor that jesse jackson is an ally 
of dinkins and that comedian jackie masons support of giuliani 
proved not very funny 
i refuse to cede the moral high ground negative campaigning 
doesnt work said dinkins as his campaign started running a 
commercial in which sen edward m kennedy dmass attacked 
giuliani for flipflopping on abortion and supporting judges and 
policies to roll back basic civil rights and civil liberties 
jewish voters are a critical group in new york elections and 
giuliani welcomed the support of mason an ordained rabbi who 
became a standup comic and now stars in the television series 
chicken soup 
but masons help turned sour when he was overheard saying 
there is a sick jewish problem of voting for a black man no 
matter how unfit he is for the job 
the resulting controversy had giuliani reeling but then dinkins 
was put on the defensive by a report he understated the value of a 
stock he sold to his son and by an antisemitic remark attributed 
to a black activist who worked for the dinkins campaign 
the activist robert c sonny carson said it was incorrect 
to call him antisemitic im antiwhite he said 
dinkins swiftly denounced carson but the incident reminded some 
jewish voters of their antipathy to jackson who campaigned for 
dinkins during the primary in which he defeated mayor ed koch 
even in the calmer atmosphere of des moines iowa its hard to 
get peoples attention with an issueoriented campaign 
paul sanfield is running citywide against city councilman 
george flagg for an atlarge seat 
my issue is affordable housing and neighborhood 
redevelopment said sanfield who lamented his problem getting 
his message out i guess issues arent that important

a terrorist attacking a police patrol 
was killed when a grenade blew up in his hands before he could 
throw it but an officer was also killed and two other people 
wounded authorities said 
three more in a series of dynamite bombings blamed on drug 
traffickers also shook the capital monday police said 
a police statement said the grenade attack occurred monday in a 
middleclass neighborhood of bogota 
after the grenade exploded fragments injured two police 
officers one of whom died moments later the statement said 
police captured another man slightly injured in the blast and 
accused him of aiding in the attack it said without giving details 
there was no immediate word on a possible motive for the attack 
which may have been related to the governments war on the the 
illicit drug trade 
the government and drug gangs have been engaged in a bloody 
struggle since midaugust when traffickers killed a leading 
presidential candidate 
authorities blame drug traffickers for most of the 237 bombings 
that have rocked colombia since the government of president 
virgilio barco declared the crackdown the blasts have killed 33 
people and injured 222 
in several of the latest attacks terrorists have targeted 
police on thursday five police officers were killed when a bomb 
exploded beside a bus carrying officers to night duty in medellin 
the next day another policeman died in the bombing of the 
national police air base outside bogota 
mondays attack occurred about the same time the wave of 
dynamite bombings hit the capital three bombs exploded in 
different parts of the city causing extensive damage but no 
injuries 
the bombs targeted a bank a social security office and a 
grocery store 
it is believed the drug traffickers are retaliating for the 
governments extradition of colombian drug suspects captured in the 
antidrug campaign authorities have sent five suspects to face 
trial in the united states 
the government has repeatedly rebuffed offers from the medellin 
cartel to negotiate an end to the violence barco has said he will 
not deal with traffickers accused of killing a justice minister a 
newspaper publisher and scores of other leading colombians in the 
last five years

author william styron got his start as a 
12yearold writing a short story for his school newspaper about a 
ship in a typhoon with a captain who mused darkly and a mate 
who gave a despondent shriek 
doris grumbachs first literary effort was titled a man and 
his dog it was good enough to win a high school contest and help 
her finagle admission to college despite failing grades she didnt 
write her first novel until 37 years later 
eggs was the first piece written by novelist william 
kennedy then a college freshman his short story about a man who 
ordered scrambled eggs in a diner was praised by kennedys mother 
and his banjo teacher but panned by his father who read it over 
breakfast and snapped what the hell is this 
kennedy still has the rejection slip from colliers magazine 
it taught me that you dont trust your parents with literature 
he said 
they were among 21 prominent american novelists poets and 
essayists who took turns monday night on the elizabethan stage of 
the shakespeare theater at the folger describing how they got 
started in the writing business 
their readings which focused on the theme of eudora weltys 
book one writers beginnings were the highlight of a 10th 
anniversary celebration of the penfaulkner award for fiction an 
annual prize honoring the best published works of fiction by 
contemporary american writers 
the award is named for the late novelist william faulkner who 
used his nobel prize funds to support talented young writers and 
is financed by gifts grants and an annual series of readings at 
the folger shakespeare library 
many of the writers thanked their parents for introducing them 
at an early age to what richard bausch called the power of 
words with family traditions of storytelling and book reading 
gloria naylor winner of the american book award for first 
fiction for the women of brewster place said she inherited her 
passionate love of books from her mother a poor mississippi 
black who joined mailorder book clubs because she was barred from 
the local library 
joyce carol oates an awardwinning novelist playwright and 
essayist said she grew up poor in lockport ny and lived in a 
world of imagination fired by her visits to the town library 
and hours of listening to stories read by her parents and 
grandparents 
writers begin as privileged listeners she said 
after his clumsy boyhood attempt at writing an adventure story 
in the style of joseph conrad styron said he abandoned his 
literary interests in favor of moviegoing until he turned 18 and 
discovered thomas wolfes novels 
for five years styron indulged the intoxicating and 
dizzying pleasure of reading hundreds of books and then began 
his first novel lie down in darkness he later won a pulitzer 
prize for the confessions of nat turner and the american book 
award for sophies choice 
susan sontag described herself as a voluntary misfit as a 
child at home in bed with a book was not only the safest place 
to be but the freest she said 
both larry mcmurtry and miss welty said they developed their 
love of words and keen imaginations during long periods of illness 
as children 
as a sickly youngster in west texas mcmurtry said he lived in 
radioland listening to popular radio serials of the 1940s when 
wartime bulletins preempted his favorite radio shows too often he 
finally dipped into a box of books left by a cousin who had joined 
the army and the literary life began for me 
miss welty said she was taken out of school at age 6 or 7 and 
put to bed with a heart condition for several months she remembers 
that an opulence of story books covered my bed they were my 
counterpane 
she fell in love first with the alphabet then the wizardry of 
the initials and letters and words of her fairy tales then heard 
the voice of the story as she learned to read and later to 
write 
i was a writer who came from a sheltered life but a sheltered 
life can be a daring life and the daring begins within she said 
other writers who joined more than 200 guests at the 
celebration which included a candlelight dinner in the librarys 
great hall were amiri baraka gwendolyn brooks hortense calisher 
pat conroy annie dillard brendan gill stephen goodwin reynolds

former president nixon today brought his private 
mission of us reconciliation with china to senior leader deng 
xiaoping who agreed the two powers should put common interests 
above ideological differences 
im very much in favor of your view regarding statetostate 
relations the 85yearold deng said at the beginning of their 
meeting at the great hall of the people 
you should focus on the strategic interests of a country and 
you should not talk about historical roots or differences in 
ideology or the strength of a country 
nixon on the fourth day of a private visit has called on the 
two countries to bury their differences over the june killings of 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing and mend their frayed 
relations 
he is the most prominent american to visit china since the 
crackdown and is expected to brief president bush upon returning to 
the united states 
soldiers killed hundreds perhaps thousands of unarmed 
civilians in beijing june 4 as the government moved to crush the 
studentled movement for a freer china 
chinese leaders have agreed it is time to renew ties but say the 
united states is to blame for the poor relations and must take the 
initiative 
at todays meeting deng praised nixon for his 1972 trip to 
china which ended 23 years of unveiled hostility and paved the way 
for restoring relations what youve done deserves our admiration 
and interest deng said it was you who as president of the 
united states changed this status 
nixon 76 told deng he had watched chineseamerican relations 
for 17 years and that china should understand the depth of american 
concern over the governments suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement 
a member of the nixon party who attended the meeting described 
it as a tough noholdsbarred exchange that covered the 
crackdown chinas ties to the united states and the soviet union 
reform in eastern europe and other subjects 
deng appeared tired at todays meeting usually he walks out to 
greet visitors this time nixon was escorted into a room to meet 
deng who was already seated 
deng disappeared from public for three months after the june 
military crackdown and was rumored to be seriously ill 
however talking to reporters after the meeting nixon said he 
was impressed by his vigor 
we found that we did not agree about many elements but we 
found that we agreed on some nixon added 
nixon said the current rift between the two countries is 
without question the most serious since 1972 
but he said he was confident the relationship will be 
sustained and those that are signaling its death are much 
premature 
at a state banquet monday hosted by premier li peng the former 
president urged a restoration of good relations but also called for 
a humanely governed china that wont turn away from greatness 
and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and stagnation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commenting on nixons 
appeal for rapprochement said the united states wants to normalize 
relations but the conditions are not yet right 
washington has suspended highlevel official contacts and cut 
off arms sales since the crackdown

the us embassy has protested to chinese 
authorities over slashed tires soldiers terrorizing diplomats 
children with rifles and other harassment an embassy source said 
the charges were made in three protests filed in recent days 
with the chinese government the source said monday 
the protests came as the chinese have increased surveillance of 
the us embassys compounds 
the embassy source said that in the past week one embassy staff 
member found a tire on his car flat on two mornings each time 
after he had entertained chinese guests two other staff members 
found their car lights had been turned on during the night 
draining the batteries and in one case a cars fan belt was stolen 
twice in the past week armed police outside the embassy pointed 
automatic rifles at children of us diplomats and pulled the 
triggers the source said the guns were not loaded 
security forces also are tailing embassy employees when they 
leave the compounds he said 
late monday night eight cars without license plates one car 
with police plates and two police motorcycles were parked in front 
of us ambassador james lilleys residence 
more than a dozen plainclothes police wrapped in cottonlined 
coats against the autumn chill stood on the sidewalk and others 
could be seen through the darktinted car windows they watched 
passing cars closely 
an equal contingent of marked and unmarked police cars sat on 
the street in front of the main embassy compound and two more were 
parked on an adjoining street 
peoples armed police with automatic rifles and helmets have 
surrounded the embassy and lilleys residence since june when 
chinese dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian took refuge 
in one of the compounds and relations between the united states and 
china deteriorated sharply 
police had issued warrants for them after the army crushed the 
prodemocracy movement on june 4 chinese officials accused the 
united states of violating international law by giving them shelter 
a few plainclothes security officials also have been stationed 
outside the other us compounds since then but the number 
increased a few weeks ago and further increased on saturday the 
embassy source said 
i dont know what it all means but its getting worse 
he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the intense vigilance at the us compounds coincides with the 
visit of former president nixon who arrived saturday on a private 
trip as the guest of the chinese government 
nixon who helped pave the way for a restoration of bilateral 
ties by visiting beijing in 1972 has been staying at the diaoyutai 
state guesthouse 
the embassy source said he could see no connection between the 
nixon visit and the heightened security

the bay cities capped world series mania 
with muted celebration and returned to the business of recovery 
from billions of dollars in earthquake damage as lawmakers prepared 
to debate how to pay the bill 
the scale of the disaster continued to become more apparent as 
the number of applicants for emergency housing grants and loans 
reached 30000 but a poll indicated most californians would 
support a sales tax hike to help out 
businesses meanwhile began ad campaigns to bring back tourists 
and conventions to prevent economic disaster on top of the natural 
calamity 
about 4000 fans cheered the oakland athletics in oaklands jack 
london square on monday but there was no parade and the oct 17 
quake that delayed the as victory over the san francisco giants 
for 10 days was in mind 
nobody likes the reason we had to wait so long to be the world 
champions but i know it means a great deal to all of us as 
manager tony la russa told the crowd which was asked to contribute 
to quake relief 
the teams arrival by ferry was an implicit endorsement of 
officials pleas for commuters to use public transportation to ease 
congestion caused by closure of the damaged bay bridge collapse of 
doubledecked interstate 880 in oakland and damage to other 
northern california roads and bridges 
about the same time workers demolishing the i880 structure 
removed the flattened car in which longshoreman buck helm amazingly 
survived four days before his rescue helm remained in serious 
condition at highland hospital 
in sacramento gov george deukmejian and state lawmakers 
announced that a special session of the legislature will convene 
thursday to consider legislation to help fund quake relief damage 
has been estimated at more than 7 billion 
the governor proposed a temporary quartercent increase in the 
states 6 percent sales tax beginning dec 1 and lasting 13 
months it would raise 800 million to pay the states estimated 
share of repairing public buildings and highways and providing 
grants to families and assistance to local governments 
according to a los angeles times poll published monday 52 
percent of 1377 californians surveyed would support a sales tax 
increase to pay for earthquake repairs and to aid victims 
the governor also said the state might have to dip into its 11 
billion emergency reserve if costs prove to be higher deukmejian 
said 
congress last week approved 35 billion for california 
earthquake relief 
the state transportation department director robert best said 
18 billion is the projected cost of repairing state and local 
roads including retrofitting all highway bridges in the state to 
make them earthquake safe 
the federal funds include 1 billion for highways best said he 
hopes more federal money will be allocated once damage estimates 
are firmed up 
elsewhere state schools superintendent bill honig said public 
schools suffered comparatively little damage because of strict 
school construction standards but repairs still will cost more 
than 50 million 
seven of the 1482 schools in the eight hardesthit counties had 
severe damage to buildings with classrooms five buildings without 
classrooms also were damaged honig said 95 percent of students 
returned to school in two days 
around the san francisco bay area the san francisco convention 
and visitors bureau the hyatt hotel corporation and oakland 
businesses began preparing advertising campaigns to keep the 
tourists and their dollars coming to the region 
were doing a lot because the world thinks weve tumbled into 
the bay said charles mcelroy general manager of the 
hyattregency in san francisco

were very welltrained and they moved their shipmates were injured 
and they did all that they could to take care of them said capt 
c flack logan after the ship arrived at its home port here monday 
one crew member who said she never thought of running for safety

running until the instant the t2 buckeye jet crashed at her feet 
sunday and cartwheeled in flames 
ms votolato 21 of houma la was knocked to the deck when 
the jet flipped upside down and crashed into the carriers tower 
but she got back up and kept taping as shipmates put out a fire 
the women were in fighting the fire taking the medical 
precautions taking every step the men were taking ms votolato 
said a ship is not a beautiful place its not but when you are 
here to do your job and when get the job done you are not a woman 
you are a sailor 
within 12 seconds of the crash the first fire hoses turned on 
the flames and the main blaze was extinguished in about two 
minutes logan said 
two separate investigations will be conducted as is routine in 
such accidents logan said safety investigators will watch the 
videotape and try to determine what caused the accident while the

low appeared to overcorrect and climbed at a steep angle before 
flipping upside down and hitting the ship

in naval aviation is known as being low and slow which is a very 
terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship

him off but for some reason the airplane was unable to comply

three people jailed for 14 years on a wrongful 
conviction for an irish republican army bombing will each get 
79000 as an interim compensation payment the government said 
today 
paul hill the fourth person wrongly convicted in the 1974 
bombing that killed five people in guildford southwest of london 
will get 15800 officials said 
home office minister john patten said in a statement to 
parliament on monday that the socalled guildford four would each 
get an initial payment his aides requesting anonymity specified 
the amounts later 
the four were freed last week after the countrys secondranking 
judge lord lane quashed the convictions ruling that police 
officers probably lied at the trial 
hill 35 was also serving a life sentence on a separate 
conviction of murdering a british soldier in belfast northern 
ireland he was freed on bail pending an appeal 
the others gerard conlon 35 and patrick armstrong 39 both 
from belfast and a london woman carole richardson 32 were freed 
unconditionally 
the ruling after a prolonged campaign to exonerate the four 
has damaged the reputation of the police and led to demands for 
reopening of other cases the government has ordered an inquiry 
into the police conduct in the guildford case 
britains recently retired top legal officer lord hailsham 
said appeal judges were right to turn down previous appeals by the 
guildford four on the evidence then available 
i cannot see how you can blame the piano because someone 
strikes the wrong note or blows a computer because someone feeds it 
false information hailsham said in a television interview on 
monday

the cases of about 80 more us soldiers missing from the vietnam 
war and other americans reported lost in laos a us envoy said 
today after talks in hanoi 
john w vessey jr said he presented the vietnamese with two new 
lists totalling about 70 discrepancy cases involving the loss 
of about 80 americans in the war 
discrepancy cases are those to which the united states has 
assigned highest priority they are cases that the vietnamese 
should have information according to us officials 
they include servicemen who were believed to have been taken 
prisoner but were not freed when the us involvement in the war 
ended in 1973 
vessey told a news conference he also asked the vietnamese to do 
research on similar types of cases over the border in laos the 
war spilled over into laos which north vietnam used as a sanctuary 
to fight usbacked south vietnam 
the vietnamese accepted both the suggestions that we made 
vessey said he held two days of talks ending sunday with foreign 
minister nguyen co thach 
it was vesseys second mission to vietnam as presidential envoy 
during his august 1987 trip he presented the vietnamese with 70 
cases specialists from both sides are now involved in their eighth 
joint field investigation to resolve those cases 
vessey said 19 of the 70 cases have already been resolved 
through the discovery of remains 
in other cases he said weve gained new information but 
theyre still inconclusive and others we dont know any more than 
we did when we started out 
he said his team urged the vietnamese to go back over the 
unresolved cases and find soldiers or other witnesses who know 
something about them 
if the man is alive we want him back if he is not alive 
wed like to be able to tell his family what happened to him 
vessey said 
vietnam says it is not holding any live americans

in cambodia where a vietnameseinstalled government is fighting 
guerrillas backed by the united states and other countries the

sen harry reid dnev is putting a hold on 
the confirmation of james cason as assistant secretary of 
agriculture because he thinks cason is a james watt clone 
i think he would be a disaster reid said monday of 
president bushs nominee to head forest and conservation programs 
at the agriculture department 
reids action postpones full senate consideration of cason until 
senate majority leader george mitchell removes the hold 
reid said if casons confirmation is taken up on the floor 
ill talk for a real long time implying a filibuster to tie up 
senate business 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has been urging the senate 
to confirm cason as quickly as possible stressing to senators he 
expects cason to follow the environmental agenda he sets 
he feels confident that jim cason is the person to do the 
job said yeutters spokeswoman kelly shipp 
in terms of policy the buck stops with clayton yeutter 
said shipp its unfair to allege that cason would be the sole 
person here at usda making natural resources policy 
reid said he feels strongly because 87 percent of the land in 
nevada is owned by the federal government when james watt was 
interior secretary under president reagan watts prodevelopment 
policies harmed environmental interests in the state said reid 
i think he cason is a james watt clone said reid 
cason was hired at the interior department while watt was 
secretary but when questioned during confirmation hearings about 
watt cason said he barely knew him 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt also 
opposes cason but the committee voted 127 to send the nomination 
to the full senate 
reid does not serve on the committee 
i spent a lot of my career developing a national park in 
nevada the last one created by the government the great basin 
national park said reid he cason authorized a mining in the 
parks rule that weakened strip mining restrictions 
although that decision has not affected great basin reid said 
he feels protective of the parks 
cason 35 has held a variety of highranking posts at the 
interior department since the early days of the reagan 
administration leahy accused him of consistently putting private 
interests ahead of public ones 
for example he said cason suppressed a report that said the 
spotted owl would be endangered if logging were conducted in 
certain forests in the pacific northwest 
cason said that only withheld the report to get more information 
sen kent conrad dnd a member of the committee had 
threatened to put a hold on the confirmation process saying he 
wanted to know more about casons sale of 82000 acres of federal 
oil shale land at 250 an acre 
the government sold the land for 17000 to private interests 
who weeks later sold it for about 37 million 
meanwhile the league of conservation voters has sent a letter 
to all 100 senators saying their votes on cason will be noted as 
the organization prepares its environmental scorecard 
mr cason has a record of antagonism toward environmental 
protection mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility the 
letter said surely the president can find someone better to fill 
his slot

farmers who are growing substitute crops on 
land where drought destroyed or damaged earlier plantings will be 
able to get a break on federal aid under a new law 
president bush on monday signed a bill that eases restrictions 
on federal farmdisaster aid 
the revised rules protect winter wheat and cotton farmers who 
otherwise might have been denied disaster payments for their lost 
crops under an agriculture department plan even though the 
producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops 
such as grain sorghum or soybeans 
under the agriculture departments initial plan even farmers 
who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until they 
harvested their second crop before they could obtain disaster 
benefits for damage to the first crop

a closed courtroom in rural new hampshire 
has become a battleground for deciding when parental discipline 
becomes so harsh that the state must intervene 
the state has asserted a right to protect the children of 
stephen and joann decosta by filing felony assault charges against 
them and by taking their four children ages 3 to 14 on grounds 
that the parents abused the two youngest in beatings administered 
with a stick and a paddle 
but the decostas and their supporters many of them fellow 
parishioners at a fundamentalist church that advocates strict 
childrearing say the state has no business intruding into a 
matter as private as disciplining children 
it comes down to this who owns the kids the state or the 
parents asked bill taylor a friend of the decostas 
taylor and others have sat for many hours this fall outside 
plymouth district court as judge edwin kelly hears testimony on 
whether the state division for children and youth services was 
justified in taking the children 
character witnesses for the decostas have included friends such 
as former gov meldrim thomson and state police lt david mccarthy 
whose children attend a churchrun school with the three oldest 
decosta children 
in rumney a small town in the southern white mountains where 
the decostas live rumors have circulated about the case for weeks 
frustrating the family and supporters who say they want to talk but 
cannot because state law prohibits it the law makes it a 
misdemeanor to discuss what goes on at a civil child abuse or 
neglect hearing 
no such restrictions apply to a criminal indictment issued oct 
19 by a grafton county grand jury the indictment accused each 
parent of seconddegree assault court papers do not say who 
brought the matter to police or indicate what prompted the 
decostas actions 
the charges allege the parents beat their two youngest children 
a 7yearold son and 3yearold daughter with a stick and a paddle 
until the childrens buttocks were red and bruised arraignment is 
scheduled nov 20 
the decostas lawyer andrew mcevoy called the indictments 
legally insufficient he argued that the documents do not say 
that the alleged victims were their children and that the alleged 
attack took place when the parents were punishing their children 
for misbehaving 
judy bell a lawyer for children and youth services would not 
discuss the case but said the state doesnt deny parents the right 
to discipline their children physically she said the agency does 
insist that there are limits though it isnt clear exactly where 
i think that thats the question that everyone would like to 
have answered to actually have a line drawn bell said 
she said the agencys goal in every case is to bring the family 
back together 
the goal has to be reunification she said 
the three youngest children are now living with a family that 
attends decostas church the oldest lives with another family 
nearby 
decosta 48 who operates an auto transmission repair shop next 
to his home declined to comment on the case i cant talk about 
it i cant even contact my representatives my elected officials 
so im bound by the law he said monday 
but his pastor defended the use of the paddle in disciplining 
children 
the bible definitely and expressly teaches the use of the rod 
in the discipline of children and we believe in it and we do it 
and i teach it said richard anderson of meredith pastor of 
calvary independent baptist church 
anderson said he generally teaches that spanking should sting 
enough to make the point and never be so hard that it would damage 
a child 
the pastor would not discuss the allegations against the 
decostas but said pointedly that if children behave well do well 
in school and are happy their parents must be doing a good job 
whatever the form or amount of discipline

build the tiltrotor aircraft the campaign to spare the osprey has 
been intense 
the contractors boeing helicopter of lester pa and bell 
helicopter textron of fort worth texas have filled the airwaves 
with television ads showing the helicopter that can fly like an 
airplane newspapers and magazines carry advertisements 
proclaiming v22 osprey affordability 
and key congressional backers of the aircraft particularly 
lawmakers from pennsylvania and texas have fired off dear 
colleague letters that include editorials and articles of praise 
for the program 
marine corps officials have even discussed the concept of an 
assault support aircraft for the osprey 
the effort however has not met with much success 
house and senate negotiators hammering out a final defense 
budget for the fiscal year that began oct 1 are considering a 
proposal of about 255 million for research and development of the 
osprey but no procurement money the ospreys fate likely will be 
decided this week as house and senate negotiators wrap up work on 
the defense bill 
the future of the program would be tied to commercial use of the 
v22 said lawmakers and congressional sources who requested 
anonymity 
the proposal is unacceptable said rep curt weldon rpa 
a member of the house armed services committee who has sent a 
number of letters to colleagues urging them to support the osprey 
with just research and development in effect there will never 
be a v22 continue the funding and a make a decision next 
year but without procurement money the program is in fact 
dead weldon said 
in proposing to cancel the osprey cheney argued a mix of 
conventional helicopters would serve as an alternative to the v22 
which at 23 million a copy was too expensive 
weldon contends cheney based his decision on inaccurate 
information 
several military witnesses have appeared before the armed 
services committee and all except secretary cheneys pencil 
pushers are on the record acknowledging that the v22 costs less 
and delivers more capability than dods proposed alternatives 
weldon said in one letter 
rep david ob martin rny a member of the house armed 
services committee and former navy pilot said the bush 
administrations alternatives arent any cheaper or as effective 
as the osprey 
while lawmakers argued their case representatives from bell 
helicopter textron promoted the v22 during a recent trade show in 
washington saying it could have been used during the panamanian 
rebels failed coup attempt against gen manuel antonio noriega and 
to help earthquake victims in northern california 
delaying the program would cause us some grief said dick 
spivey the director of v22 business development 
supporters of cheneys decision say the secretary had to make 
the hard choices and they scoff at the argument the v22 could 
be used in panama 
thats a little like saying the b2 can be used to blow up 
libyan leader moammar gadhafis tent said rep andy ireland 
rfla a member of the armed services panel it isnt a good 
hard argument 
meanwhile gen michael p sullivan director of the marine 
corps combat development command at quantico va has talked about 
the concept of an assault support aircraft that would provide 
support for the v22 
congressional sources who requested anonymity said the 
discussion by the marine corps of the support aircraft possibly was 
an attempt to bolster the campaign for the v22 
but lt col robert mclean spokesman for the center at 
quantico said the discussion of support aircraft is conceptual 
only not something thats in a sort of formal proposal stage 
this is not something that has special sponsorship of the marine 
corps

nearly half of the lake acreage in 34 states 
is badly polluted or likely soon to become that way the 
environmental protection agency said today 
the epas latest survey of lake water quality shows that serious 
pollution problems have impaired about onefourth of more than 12 
million acres of lakes examined in those states pollution 
threatens similar impairment in another 20 percent of the lake 
acres 
while the causes for the lake pollution varied threefourths of 
the pollution was attributed to agricultural and urban runoffs 
another 11 percent was blamed on industrial or sewage releases and 
the remainder to natural causes 
meanwhile the epa was named in a lawsuit monday charging that 
the agency has failed to develop national standards for toxic 
pollution of public waterways 
two environmental and public interest groups the natural 
resources defense council and public citizen claimed in the suit 
filed in us district court that the epa was violating the clean 
water act by allowing millions of pounds of unregulated toxic waste 
to be released into waterways 
over twothirds of the industrial facilities that release 
toxics into our waterways are not covered by nationwide epa 
regulations said robert adler of the natural resources defense 
council 
the suit claimed that at least 70 million pounds of unregulated 
toxic wastes are released directly into waterways or through public 
sewage systems by sources ranging from pharmaceutical companies to 
the mining and textile industries 
the epa had no immediate comment on the lawsuit 
the agencys lake quality report said the most significant cause 
of lake impairment was excessive plant and algae growth resulting 
from high levels of nutrients being released into the water often 
those releases came from sewage facilities or agricultural runoff 
the study said 
such unwanted plant and algae growth often harms recreational 
activity and reduces a lakes scenic value but more importantly 
the growth depletes necessary oxygen and chokes off other life 
including fish said erik olson an attorney with the national 
wildlife association 
olson said the epa findings understate the true problem with 
water pollution nationwide because not all pollutants that affect 
water quality are included 
if you consider all the pollutants that have potentially 
devastating effects on fish and wildlife perhaps on people as 
well the number of impaired lake acres would be significantly 
higher maintained olson in an interview 
epa officials acknowledged that the degree of lake pollution has 
been difficult to document nationally because of shortcomings in 
data collection 
for example the new report on lake quality did not include data 
from 16 states because they did not report to the epa it also did 
not include data from the great lakes the countrys biggest lake 
system which has had major pollution problems 
other reasons for lakes becoming impaired are high levels of 
sediment from rocks and soil being deposited into lakes warm water 
discharges that disturb fish habitat and the release of pesticides 
and other toxics according to the report 15 percent of the 
pollution problem on the lakes examined was attributed to metals 
and inorganics and another 3 percent to pesticides 
the study involved lake water quality studies in 34 states with 
more than 18 million lake acres of those 124 million acres were 
assessed and 45 percent were determined to be either impaired or 
threatened with impairment

white house rejection of senate minority 
leader bob doles suggestion for higher federal gasoline taxes 
means the idea will go nowhere in congress say democratic house 
and senate leaders 
consistent with president bushs campaign promise to not raise 
taxes white house spokesman marlin fitzwater deflected the 
proposal monday 
we do not feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is 
necessary at this time fitzwater told reporters 
on nbctvs meet the press program sunday dole rkan 
said he would support an increase in the 91centpergallon 
gasoline tax for rebuilding the infrastructure not for debt 
reduction 
but top democrats said monday that doles endorsement for the 
idea meant little without bushs backing 
before it goes through congress we would have to be ensured 
of the presidents support said house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash foley said he favors raising the fuel levy to rebuild 
crumbling roads 
he bush has veto power and theres no way to override a 
veto on a tax increase thats for sure said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine so theres no point going 
through the exercise 
democrats who have learned painfully in recent elections that 
voters oppose higher taxes have been loath to push any major 
revenue legislation without lining up presidential approval in 
advance 
dole who unsuccessfully challenged bush for his partys 
presidential nomination last year has supported tax increases for 
specified purposes before 
he originally supported the income surcharge on the elderly to 
pay for medicare coverage of extended illnesses a program congress 
enacted last year and now is in the process of rolling back he has 
also favored an oil import fee 
dole did not suggest an amount for a gasoline tax increase 
officials estimate that for each penny increase the levy would 
raise an additional 1 billion 
other lawmakers from both parties rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the taxwriting house ways and means committee 
and members of the senate and house panels that oversee public 
works have previously suggested boosting the gasoline tax 
some have suggested using the money for road programs while 
others have said it would be a good way to reduce the federal 
deficit which reached 152 billion last year 
a pennyagallon gasoline tax first took effect in 1932 the 
most recent increase occurred jan 1 1987 when it was raised by 
onetenth of one cent to pay for cleaning up leaky underground fuel 
tanks 
of the rest all but one cent goes to road and bridge work the 
remaining penny is for mass transit assistance

former housing secretary samuel pierce jrs 
attorney says the justice department is stretching regulations to 
avoid paying pierces legal bills from a congressional 
investigation 
a justice department spokesman said the agencys ruling was 
based on a legal interpretation 
but attorney robert plotkin said the justice department offered 
an offthewall reason why regulations did not qualify pierce 
for reimbursement of private legal fees arising from a house 
subcommittees probe of the department of housing and urban 
development 
the former secretary twice refused to answer questions when he 
appeared before the house government operations employment and 
housing subcommittee which has conducted hearings on mismanagement 
and political favoritism in the award of hud grants during pierces 
tenure 
pierce asked hud to pay his legal expenses because they arose 
from questions about his performance of official duties in the 
reagan administration 
but the justice department asked by hud to rule on the request 
said two weeks ago that the department has no responsibility to 
represent pierce and therefore wouldnt rule on whether he 
qualified for reimbursement of private legal fees 
department spokesman david runkel said our decision was based 
on the civil divisions interpretation of the law the lawyers took 
a look at it and thats their decision 
its a hot potato said plotkin hud hands off to justice 
justice hands off back to hud 
the justice department plotkin said stretched the clear 
meaning of the regulations to say it wasnt responsible for 
representing pierce 
i couldnt believe that of several potential grounds that 
perhaps they might have used to justify not paying it the one they 
used seemed so offthewall plotkin said 
the regulation says current and former federal officials may 
be provided representation in civil and congressional proceedings 
and in state criminal proceedings when the actions for which 
representation is requested reasonably appear to have been 
performed within the scope of the employees employment and 
providing representation would otherwise be in the interest of the 
united states 
one would think that clearly on its face we are eligible 
plotkin said and then they have to exercise their discretion as 
to whether or not they want to pay it 
but in an oct 25 letter to hud deputy assistant attorney 
general stephen c bransdorfer said legal representation by the 
justice department is available only in situations where the 
employee is subject to civil or state criminal proceedings as a 
result of actions taken within the normal scope of that employees 
authority 
if there are no such underlying proceedings then 
representation is not available bransdorfer said 
there are no civil or state criminal proceedings against pierce 
hud said that based on bransdorfers determination pierces 
request was denied 
plotkin declined to describe the size of his law firms legal 
bill saying only that he had been prepared to negotiate with the 
justice department over what expenses the government would pay

contrary to reports of deadlines and imminent 
showdowns secretary of state james a baker iii says he does not 
expect a makeorbreak decision on mideast negotiations while 
he is on an eightday visit to australia 
baker is leaving late tonight for talks with prime minister bob 
hawke and also to attend a meeting in canberra of 12 nations 
considering the formation of a new economic compact to foster free 
trade and an openmarket system 
known as the pacific basin initiative it has bakers support as 
timely because the united states is boosting trade with asia to new 
heights trade has more than tripled in 10 years to 280 billion in 
1988 a senior us official said monday 
ten asian nations but not china taiwan or hong kong are 
attending along with the united states and canada some 
especially japan have been accused at times of protectionist 
policies 
but the canberra meeting is designed to put pressure to open 
markets around the world said the us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity open market systems tend to be associated 
with greater freedom 
as he prepared to depart baker said he was reviewing his 
fivepoint proposal for mideast talks at israels request but he 
told the associated press in an interview monday i dont 
anticipate we will have definitive answers either yes or no 
before i get back from australia 
he said israeli foreign minister moshe arens may be traveling in 
asia during the period and we may continue to talk but baker 
added i would guide you off of looking for either a make or 
break on this thing before the trip is over 
arens last week notified baker the israeli government accepted 
the us proposal but with two provisos they were that the 
palestine liberation organization be excluded from any israeli 
meeting with palestinians and that the agenda be limited to 
preparations for an election on the west bank and in gaza 
prime minister yitzhak shamir proposed the election with us 
endorsement as a way of having palestinians choose their 
representative to negotiate five years of limited selfrule in the 
territories the plo which israel shuns contends it is the sole 
representative of the palestinians 
bakers proposal gave israel assurances it would talk only to a 
palestinian delegation it found satisfactory he also said he was 
not pressuring israel to deal with the plo 
recent reports from israel suggest baker is close to a decision 
on whether to keep trying shamir was quoted last tuesday as saying 
there was no large gap between the two approaches and in a 
few days we will know if there is an agreement or not 
but baker disputed his monthlong effort was at a critical point 
i have not put any deadlines down and we will continue to try 
and work the problem he said but i really dont anticipate 
its going to make or break before we get back from australia

the only fbi agent ever convicted of 
espionage walked out of prison with a smile on his face as he was 
released on 337000 bond to await a third trial 
after five years behind bars richard miller was released from 
custody monday afternoon said charles almanza supervisor of court 
operations for the us marshals office 
the 52yearold former agent is accused of passing secret us 
documents to his lover soviet emigre svetlana ogorodnikov mrs 
ogorodnikov and her husband nikolay pleaded guilty in the case 
and are serving federal prison terms 
millers 1985 trial ended with jurors unable to reach a verdict 
a second jury convicted him in 1986 and us district judge david 
kenyon sentenced him to two life terms plus 50 years in prison the 
9th us circuit court of appeals reversed that decision in april 
ruling that kenyon erred in allowing liedetector evidence 
although miller declined to meet with reporters after his 
release he had issued a statement earlier in the day in 
anticipation of his being freed 
i am hopeful that in a fair trial the truth will come out and 
i can be vindicated he said 
after five years in prisons i need a little time with my 
family and my lawyers before answering your questions he added 
i did not betray my country 
earlier monday kenyon scheduled millers third trial for april 
3 1990 
millers release was delayed by the prosecutions review of bond 
papers to ensure that property put up for bail was accurately 
described to the court 
millers sister brother and a friend each had put up property 
to secure his release 
miller who has been imprisoned since his oct 2 1984 arrest 
appeared briefly in court monday with his hands shackled behind his 
back 
clad in a gray suit he gave a thumbs up sign to relatives in 
the courtroom 
later when he was released from jail he had a smile on his 
face said his attorney stanley greenberg 
prosecutors portrayed miller as an ineffectual agent whose 
bitterness over his undistinguished fbi career made him an easy 
target for soviet spy recruiters 
they said the 20year fbi veteran was planning to travel to 
vienna with mrs ogorodnikov to meet with soviet intelligence 
agents 
miller went to fbi agents on sept 27 1984 and revealed his 
relationship with mrs ogorodnikov however he has maintained he 
was trying to redeem his fbi career by infiltrating the soviet kgb

the study conducted by the congressional budget office also 
showed that the percentage of blacks among the nations recruits 
has dropped since 1980 but that minorities continue to be 
disproportionately represented in the armed forces 
the report released monday said the results represent a 
considerable change from the beginning of the decade when testing 
problems and recruiting difficulties resulted in large numbers of 
low scorers and nongraduates being accepted for military service 
in 1980 less than 70 percent of activeduty recruits for the

ferdinand and imelda marcos rejected a plea 
bargain last year that the us attorney general told them was 
approved by thenpresident reagan mrs marcos attorney says in 
court papers 
the plea offer was made at a meeting briefly attended by us 
attorney general richard thornburgh according to the papers filed 
last month by richard a hibey 
the attorney general started the meeting by advising us that 
the president was aware that the meeting was taking place and what 
would be conveyed to us during the conference had the presidents 
full knowledge and approval hibey said 
on oct 21 1988 three days after the meeting the deposed 
philippine leader and his wife were charged in a racketeering 
indictment with stealing more than 100 million from their 
countrys treasury and using the money to buy artwork real estate 
and jewelry in the united states 
marcos died sept 28 the trial of mrs marcos and codefendants 
including saudi financier adnan khashoggi is scheduled to begin 
march 14 in us district court 
the plea offer was made by thenus attorney rudolph w 
giuliani who is now the republican candidate for mayor and 
assistant us attorney charles labella the papers said 
the presidents personal attention in a criminal case is 
unusual but the white house does get involved in sensitive matters 
that have implications for foreign policy government officials 
said 
justice department spokesman dave runkel and reagans spokesman 
mark weinberg declined to comment on the case because it is 
pending in the courts 
after thornburgh left the meeting giuliani described a 
nonnegotiable proposal with respect to the disposition of 
proposed charges against our clients hibey said 
giuliani said he would go forward with the indictment unless the 
marcoses agreed to his proposal by the end of the business day of 
oct 20 1988 according to hibey he did not provide any details 
of the governments proposal 
labella declined to comment on hibeys account 
published reports at the time of the indictment citing 
unidentified sources said the offer called for marcos to forfeit 
millions of dollars worth of real estate artwork and jewelry in 
return for a recommendation that he be spared prison 
hibeys statement was filed in connection with a pretrial motion 
seeking thousands of confidential government documents that mrs 
marcos lawyers say they need to defend her 
another marcos attorney john bartko who was also at the 
meeting said in a separate statement that mrs marcos lawyers 
were seeking documents that might show prior us knowledge of the 
marcoses allegedly illegal behavior knowledge that the marcoses 
had substantial assets other than those in the indictment and us 
participation in the overthrow of the marcos regime 
in response papers labella called the motion a witchs brew 
concocted to stultify this prosecution in a bewildering search for 
evidence that is irrelevant to this fraud case

soviet lawmakers are considering heavy sales taxes 
for cigarettes and beer and raising the price of caviar and other 
delicacies as part of efforts to significantly reduce the countrys 
crippling budget deficit 
at the same time they are calling for more spending on infants 
the sick and the elderly and suggest that such outlays be funded 
in part by auctioning the vast fleet of official luxury cars 
the supreme soviet legislature which is grappling with the 
national budget for the first time is trying to cut an estimated 
143 billion budget deficit to 95 billion at the official rate of 
exchange 
the us budget deficit for the year ending sept 30 was 152 
billion the proposed soviet deficit would be about twice as bad 
considering the smaller size of the soviet economy 
selling off government and communist party automobiles would 
raise 398 million while a 30 percent tax on tobacco and a 20 
percent tax on beer would provide 37 billion in revenue 
according to a report issued monday by finance minister valentin 
pavlov 
also suggested were cuts in the losses of stateowned 
enterprises and higher prices on delicacies such as crab caviar 
and tongue 
supreme soviet committees called for 43 billion in new 
spending on pensions medicine orphanage food maternity hospitals 
and other social programs pavlov said 
the budget originally proposed by the kremlin and now adjusted 
by the legislators retains the basic bias of previous plans 
rather than free the market to distribute scarce resources it adds 
privileged allocations for special groups from sick infants to 
striking miners 
coal miners across the country went on strike in july returning 
to work only after being promised raises and a wealth of shipments 
of scarce soap food and other items the new budget includes 16 
billion for wage increases in the coal regions 
other appropriations include 512 million for material 
encouragement of the fish industry 111 million for the 
krasnoyarsk and irkutsk regions of siberia and 398 million for 
raises for the police and other interior ministry workers 
a special appropriation of 14 billion for the social needs of 
railway workers apparently stems in part from fears that a railroad 
strike could quickly cripple the economy in recent weeks various 
problems on the rail network led to a pileup of millions of tons of 
cargo in ports and stations for lack of unloading 
the government is suggesting cutting oil exports by roughly 28 
percent or 38 million tons per day next year to ease domestic fuel 
shortages according to one budget document 
the soviet union suffers erratic domestic gasoline shortages 
and soviet television has shown farms unable to harvest grain for 
lack of fuel officials have warned in recent weeks that continuing 
strikes in the coal fields could result in power shortages in the 
long russian winter 
budget documents also indicated that planners are running into 
difficulties finding enough foreign currency to finance the grain 
purchases planned for 1990 
the soviet union announced a drastic devaluation of the value of 
the ruble last week from 159 to 16 cents but the lower rate is 
limited to the cash transactions of tourists and to soviet citizens 
changing money for travel abroad the budget figures are converted

a homeless man who said he secretly lived in a 
hospital storeroom and roamed the corridors in surgeons garb was 
convicted of raping and murdering a pregnant doctor in her office 
at the hospital 
steven smith 23 admitted strangling dr kathryn hinnant at 
bellevue hospital on jan 7 
the state court jury rejected smiths attorneys claim he was 
insane and therefore wasnt responsible for the crimes 
jurors deliberated less than two hours before accepting the 
prosecutors argument that the insanity plea was a ruse by a 
streetsmart defendant 
ms hinnant 33 who was five months pregnant was found by her 
husband eric johnson the morning after the killing in her 
fourthfloor office in the 1200bed hospital 
the defendants mother marian smith said he didnt have a 
ghost of a chance with the ghosts in that courtroom 
smith was convicted of all counts intentional murder murder 
during commission of another felony rape robbery and sodomy he 
could be sentenced to a maximum of 50 years to life in prison 
justice james leff set sentencing was set for nov 21 
according to testimony smith told police he sometimes slept in 
a storeroom on the hospitals 22nd floor and walked around 
unnoticed in surgical garb and carrying a stethoscope he claimed 
he watched operations slept in the doctors quarters and visited 
patients rooms 
smiths lawyer marvyn kornberg argued that smith deliberately 
left clues at the scene so police would find and hospitalize him 
as proof of smiths insanity kornberg cited medical records 
back to when his client was 14 almost all say smith has low 
intelligence delusions and hallucinations 
a psychiatrist who testified for the defense said smith appeared 
to have a psychosis related to schizophrenia 
smith initially told police he had an accomplice named john 
kornberg said john was a delusion that the defendant really 
thought this person had punched and raped hinnant and then helped 
him kill her 
the man is mentally sick kornberg told jurors the man is 
not criminally responsible for what he does 
but assistant district attorney james kindler argued that smith 
is sane he was aware of what murder was and he was aware that 
kathryn hinnant was murdered kindler said so why is insanity 
a defense 
kindler said smith invented stories about hearing voices 
compulsive behavior and john because he was trying to escape 
responsibility for what he did 
smith was aware of what he did said juror alvin klein a 
drama critic

boeing agreed to pay the federal government 
11 million in connection with alleged overcharges on air force 
contracts but denied wrongdoing 
federal officials in wichita and washington announced monday 
that robert l dryden president of boeing military airplanes 
signed the settlement which the company characterized as a 
goodfaith disagreement over pricing procedures 
in philadelphia meanwhile jury selection began in a case in 
which general electric co and two employees are charged with 
bilking the government of 10 million for a battlefield computer 
system 
jury selection is expected to be completed by thursday ge 
facing its second such fraud case in four years is charged with 
mail fraud and making false statements the fine could reach 719 
million 
in the kansas case the boeing inc division did not acknowledge 
the validity of the governments claims 
however a document reportedly presented to federal grand jurors 
contained a company officials calculations of how much money would 
be generated by the overcharges 
under the settlement the company must pay the 11 million 
within five days the agreement says boeing wont face civil or 
criminal prosecution in the case except possible internal revenue 
service claims 
were certainly pleased that an amicable settlement could be 
reached said company spokesman richard l ziegler 
ziegler refused to discuss the potential irs liability or how 
the alleged overcharges occurred 
the case involved contracts for new aluminum skins or outer 
coverings on kc135 refueling tankers and transports from 1974 to 
1986 government investigators alleged boeing overcharged for 
aluminum raw materials by quoting supplier catalog prices instead 
of their actual costs which were 12 percent to 13 percent less 
a federal grand jury in wichita where the division is based 
heard hundreds of hours of testimony and inspected thousands of 
documents for more than nine months before prosecutors withdrew the 
case late last month 
in philadelphia the government also has filed a civil lawsuit 
against ge seeking 23 million in overcharges and damages in the 
234 million project from 1983 to 1986 
under the nobid contract the ge subsidiary management and 
technical services co in the philadelphia suburb king of prussia 
was to provide 233 mobile units in five production years beginning 
in 1984 
the government alleges the company padded the costs and failed 
to notify the pentagon of savings negotiated with subcontractors 
accused with ge are james badolato 41 of springfield pa and 
gerald a leo 51 of king of prussia 
the company and officials have pleaded innocent although ge 
acknowledged an internal investigation uncovered discrepancies 
totaling 369 million which the company has refunded 
ge the nations secondlargest defense contractor pleaded 
guilty in may 1985 to illegally claiming 800000 in cost overruns 
on minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles and paid a 104 
million fine

former gov lester maddox once a flamboyant 
symbol of segregation says his plan to enter the 1990 democratic 
race for governor appears to be a certainty 
but the 74yearold maddox said he will make no official 
announcement until january 
maddox who announced last year he would enter the race if no 
conservative democratic candidate came forward to challenge the 
partys national establishment released a statement monday of his 
intentions 
lt gov zell miller state rep lauren bubba mcdonald and 
state sen roy barnes have formally entered the democratic race 
and atlanta mayor andrew young has indicated he will run 
on the republican side state rep johnny isakson and former 
superior court judge greeley ellis are running 
it is true that a number of candidates have announced or 
promised to announce maddox said most are men i personally 
know as good men 
maddox contended though that they are all followers and 
captives of the political establishment without conservative 
records and in my judgment could not be elected as a democratic 
candidate for governor of georgia in 1990 
maddox called the other democratic contenders a bunch of 
lookalikes who need campaign consultants to create an image 
although he has been treated for cancer maddox said his health 
is fantastic and he doesnt consider himself too old for the 
office 
maddox who was georgia governor from 1967 to 1971 later was 
lieutenant governor under thengov jimmy carter 
maddox gained national attention before he became governor by 
selling his restaurant rather than serving blacks 
yet despite fears of a segregationist administration maddox 
named more blacks to high state office when he was governor than 
any of his predecessors and adopted a moderate approach to racial 
issues

that sold nato secrets reportedly was recruited 15 years ago by a 
hungarian who immigrated to the united states fought in vietnam 
and served as an army captain in germany 
the captain zoltan szabo now retired left hungary in 1956 
became a us citizen and joined the army abc news reported monday 
he fought in vietnam and was decorated for bravery but spent 
much of his military career in west germany with the 8th infantry 
division 
in 1967 szabo made his first contacts as a spy for hungarys 
secret service abc said citing documents unidentified 
investigators and unidentified members of the spy ring 
in 1974 he recruited thensgt clyde lee conrad who was 
arrested aug 23 1988 in west germany and is awaiting trial there 
on a charge of high treason abc said conrad is accused of selling 
nato secrets to hungary and czechoslovakia 
szabo lives in neutral austria and so cant be touched by west 
german authorities said alexander prechtel chief spokesman for 
the federal prosecutors office 
the austrians have not permitted any extradition and are not 
pursuing him because under austrian law what szabo is said to have 
done is not punishable and this did take place in austria 
prechtel told the associated press 
the fbi is investigating at least a dozen people believed to 
have worked with conrad who operated one of the biggest rings 
spying on the united states since world war ii abc said 
the fbi expects to arrest at least one other person before 
christmas the network said 
german authorities arent pursuing other members of the 
purported ring prechtel said noting the prosecutors authority in 
military spy cases extends only to nonactive soldiers 
we are not investigating in this direction the spokesman 
said 
abc said the documents conrad and szabo copied or stole included 
natos plans for fighting a war against the sovietled warsaw pact 
including detailed descriptions of nuclear weapons and plans for 
movement of troops tanks and aircraft 
except for a 14month period in the united states conrad served 
with the 8th infantry in bad kreuznach west germany about 50 
miles from frankfurt from 1975 through 1985 
quoting an alleged member of the spy ring abc said conrad who 
was in charge of a vault where all the 8th infantry divisions 
secret documents were kept took suitcases stuffed with classified 
papers out of the base 
he then copied pages of documents with a 35mm camera a copying 
machine and even a home video camera abc said 
citing investigative documents abc said conrad once tricked the 
cia into paying at least 70000 for parts of a classified us 
document he had already stolen and sold to hungary 
abc also reported that one of conrads recruits continued to 
work for conrad after returning to the united states illegally 
exporting hundreds of thousands of advanced computer chips to the 
east bloc through a phony company in canada 
if convicted conrad faces a maximum sentence of life in prison 
a statement from the federal prosecutors office in frankfurt 
said conrad received 1 million from the hungarians and 100000 
from the czechs for his work 
conrad 42 a native of sebring ohio retired from the army in 
1985 after 20 years and continued to live in bad kreuznach

chinas parliament today ousted two hong kong 
residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony 
saying they were unfit because they had condemned chinas crackdown 
on its prodemocracy movement 
its leadership ruled szeto wah and martin lee no longer fit to 
serve on the chinesedominated committee that is formulating the 
british colonys constitution for when it reverts to chinese 
control in 1997 
the chinese lawmakers said the two can only return to the 
committee if they abandon their antagonistic stand against the 
chinese government and their attempt to nullify the sinobritish 
joint declaration on hong kong the official xinhua news agency 
reported 
britain and hong kong agreed in 1984 that the colony a coastal 
enclave would revert to chinese rule in 1997 
the new constitution known as the basic law is supposed to 
guarantee a one countrytwo systems formula under which the 
territory is to keep its western capitalist system for 50 years 
with the takeover date drawing nearer china and hong kong have 
been sharply at odds 
china has strongly objected to the active support that has 
blossomed in hong kong for people involved in the beijing 
prodemocracy movement that chinas communist leaders crushed on 
june 4 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military 
attack after which many leaders of the studentinspired movement 
fled into hiding and exile 
earlier this month china suspended repatriation of illegal 
chinese immigrants in hong kong for two weeks after the colony 
allowed a worldclass chinese swimmer to seek asylum in the united 
states 
residents in hong kong in turn have been worried that the 
chinese crackdown has demonstrated it will not honor its promises 
to maintain personal freedoms and capitalism in hong kong 
xinhua said the two members removed from the committee had 
organized a group called the hong kong citizens federation in 
support of the patriotic and democratic movement it said the 
group openly advocated the overthrow of the beijing government 
congress noted that the two had already said they would not take 
part in lawdrafting work under the current chinese government 
xinhua said the chinese lawmakers also said the pair had called 
for reexamination of the 1984 britishchinese pact 
a poll published today indicated a large majority of hong kong 
residents are skeptical about whether china will keep its promises 
to hong kong 
nearly 70 percent of the 600 people surveyed in the telephone 
poll expressed a lack of confidence that the new constitution would 
ensure that the one countrytwo systems promise will be kept by 
china 
just 3 percent said they were very confident the basic law 
would guarantee the formula 
the poll conducted by inrasia pacific was sponsored by the 
englishlanguage south china morning post

about 20 soviet journalists are attending a 
conference on issues including outer space and pollution absent 
was an editor whos doing penance for publishing a recent poll that 
found mikhail gorbachev less popular than a leading dissident 
vladislav starkov was to appear at the fifth general chautauqua 
conference on ussoviet relations 
but leonid drobrokhotov a senior member of the soviet central 
committee of the communist party said the liberal editor of the 
26million circulation weekly arguments and facts was strongly 
urged to remain at home to resolve problems arising from the poll 
we have a very difficult situation now in the country 
drobrokhotov said at news conference monday he has a great 
responsibility for correct information and for this reason the 
best way is for him to be in moscow 
he is a communist and we have the right to advise members of 
the communist party what to do and what not to do 
gorbachev reportedly called for starkovs resignation after the 
weekly the countrys most popular newspaper published a reader 
survey indicating human rights activist andrei sakharov was more 
popular than the soviet president 
soviet lawmakers the newspapers workers and other editors 
rallied in starkovs defense and he was not fired 
dobrokhotov said gorbachev told starkov im waiting for the 
correct results 
the following edition that appeared oct 20 was a chastened 
version of arguments and facts the lead story confessed that the 
first poll was an unscientific sampling of readers letters and 
included what it described as a scientific poll in which 
gorbachevs performance got a favorable assessment from the 
majority of respondents 
yuri ustimenko chief editor of the american desk of the 
official soviet news agency tass said the starkov case does not 
represent a tightening of restrictions on soviet journalists 
its an exceptional case i dont see any trend or any 
pressures he said its very unlike gorbachev to demand the 
resignation of a particular editor 
although dobrokhotov acknowledged that polls in the soviet union 
are not always correct he said they nevertheless must be conducted 
scientifically 
the criticism toward starkov was not because he had his own 
point of view dobrokhotov said but he did not objectively 
reflect the real opinion of the public he agreed this public 
opinion poll was not correct the results of the second poll 
reflect more objectively the real situation in the country 
dobrokhotov said the decision to delay starkovs visit abroad 
was not punishment but rather an objective solution 
the conference in pittsburgh is sponsored by the university of 
pittsburgh and chautauqua institution in western new york 
about 200 soviet delegates ranging from laborers to 
psychiatrists are staying with pittsburgh area residents 
this is citizens diplomacy versus official diplomacy said 
vladimir v petrovsky soviet deputy minister of foreign affairs 
its a place for a new kind of exchange

a 17year legislative battle for gay rights in 
massachusetts ended with state senate passage of a bill banning 
discrimination against homosexuals in employment credit and 
housing 
gov michael dukakis said he would sign the measure that emerged 
from the senate monday and make massachusetts only the second state 
in the nation after wisconsin to enact such legislation 
this is the single greatest victory that gay people in the 
united states have won in 1989 said david lafontaine of the 
coalition for gay and lesbian civil rights i think by far and 
away the greatest impact of this bill will be the national 
resonance 
the house approved the measure last week lafontaine predicted 
the passage of the bill in massachusetts would spur gay rights 
efforts in other states 
dukakis said it has taken 17 long years but when i sign this 
bill massachusetts will be able to ensure that all of the rights 
and the privileges that we all enjoy as citizens will not be denied 
to anyone based on sexual orientation 
the senate reserved the right to reconsider its 2213 vote but 
the measures sponsor said that was just a formality 
everything is over but the celebrating said democratic sen 
michael barrett 
the battle could continue until the 1990 election as at least 
two groups have promised to try and repeal any gay rights 
legislation through a statewide vote 
the legislation bans discrimination based on sexual orientation 
in employment housing credit and public accommodations and 
empowers the massachusetts commission against discrimination to 
investigate complaints 
the bills chief senate opponent republican sen edward kirby 
scoffed at what he says amounts to providing rights to a group 
based on the behavior of its members 
why dont we have an amendment to the bill that protects 
members of the flat earth society kirby said 
sen david locke a republican speculated that the measure 
would open the door to unreasonable protests against layoffs and 
firings 
no longer will the standards be competence or ability or 
diligence or arriving on time or absenteeism it will be whether or 
not they were fired because they were gay locke said 
the bill moved through the final stages of the legislative 
process after its backers agreed to amendments that some 
homosexuals found offensive 
among the amendments are provisions stating that the state does 
not endorse homosexuality exempting religious institutions and 
stating that it does not recognize homosexual partnerships 
this bill isnt going to end bigotry but this bill will 
say the state neither encourages nor condones discrimination 
said arline isaacson cochairman of the massachusetts gay and 
lesbian political caucus for 17 years by not passing this bill 
the state has perhaps not deliberately but tacitly encouraged 
discrimination

children delight in the axewielding 
psychopaths monsters ghosts and other horrors of haunted houses 
each halloween its the insurance companies that are spooked 
civic groups that set up haunted houses to entertain children 
and raise money are finding that scaring up insurance can be 
expensive and tough especially if insurers think the houses 
attractions are dangerous 
some of the haunted houses are innocuous but some get 
pretty involved with people jumping out and grabbing you hanging 
nooses and open flame said fran brown underwriter at crump e amp 
s of florida inc an insurance broker 
moving staircases are frowned on too because they could cause 
people to lose their balance and fall brown said 
because of the possibility of injury and damage most insurers 
do not offer coverage and those that do may charge thousands of 
dollars for the few days the house operates 
the brookfield high school band parents are paying 1439 for 
property and liability insurance for a haunted house they hope will 
raise 10000 for a band trip 
i think its a very excessive amount said noel costa vice 
president of fundraising for the parents 
but insurers say prices are based on what they perceive to be 
the risk 
liability insurance alone can cost 750 to 12000 depending on 
how elaborate the house is and how much coverage is sought brown 
said 
rates are also based on the number of visitors expected and the 
length of time the haunted house will be open she said 
major insurance companies seldom sell temporary policies for 
spook houses hartfords travelers corp for example says it is 
not financially feasible to sell them 
some companies like massachussettsbased lexington insurance 
co are picky about what theyll insure and what they wont 
lexington avoids insuring houses with rolling floors for fear they 
will collapse

former president lyndon b johnson bragged he was 
a world war ii hero but he actually observed only 13 minutes of 
combat according to a book to be published next year 
an excerpt from means of ascent published monday in the new 
yorker magazine claims the silver star that johnson said he won for 
his heroism in world war ii was awarded merely as a political 
gesture by gen douglas macarthur 
the book by robert a caro will be the second volume of his 
comprehensive biography of johnson covering the former presidents 
hopelessness and despair from 1941 to 1948 
caro writes that in the years after the war johnson portrayed 
himself as a warscarred veteran of many battles on many fronts 
actually caro says mr johnson saw combat in the south 
pacific only as an observer for a total of 13 minutes 
not only did johnson accept the silver star the new yorker 
serialization says he arranged to accept it in public several 
times buying the decoration in an armynavy store in washington 
he took it to texas where in a number of public appearances it 
was affixed to his lapel as if for the first time 
caro said johnson rapidly came to feel not only that he 
deserved it but that he deserved more that the silver star was not 
a sufficiently high honor for such heroism as his 
george christian johnsons presidential press secretary said 
monday he never heard johnson brag about his war record 
i never heard him embellish it although he did wear his 
little silver star in his lapel christian said its 
conceivable a lot of people in world war ii like to imagine they 
did more than they did 
caros first volume the years of lyndon johnson the path to 
power was published in 1982 and won the national book critics 
circle award for nonfiction 
earlier caro won a pulitzer prize for his biography of new york 
power broker robert moses 
caro said monday he spent four years near austin researching 
johnsons early years he said what emerged from his interviews was 
a portrait less flattering than those found in some of the 17 
johnson biographies published before his 
texans are very honest he said they will not lie to you 
if you can find the right question they will answer 
lady bird johnson the former presidents widow stopped 
cooperating with him early in his research caro said but former 
texas gov john connally decided to talk to caro only after reading 
the first volume connally granted four days of interviews

president daniel ortega said he has 
asked the rev jesse jackson to persuade us officials and 
lawmakers to support the disbanding of the nicaraguan contra rebel 
force 
a presidential communique said ortega spoke by telephone monday 
with jackson an unsuccessful candidate for the democratic 
presidential nomination last year 
frank watkins a chicago spokesman for jackson said jackson was 
in washington when he spoke with ortega jackson did not issue a 
statement on the conversation 
ortega said in his statement that he asked jackson to try to 
have us money allotted for the contras diverted to the united 
nations and the organization of american states he said that would 
speed demobilization of the rebels and assure the nicaraguan 
elections set for feb 25 would be held in peace 
we asked jackson to focus his mediation efforts on having 
the united states stop placing obstacles on the demobilization of 
the contras the communique said 
ortega stunned a meeting of 17 nations at a costa rican 
independence celebration on saturday by announcing he intended to 
suspend the 1yearold ceasefire in the governments war with the 
rebels 
he accused the rebels of disrupting voter registration by 
ambushing security units and intimidating citizens ortega said he 
would make a final decision on the truce by today 
at the united nations in new york secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar urged ortega to extend the truce 
in a message to ortega the un chief said monday he shared 
ortegas concern about the attacks which the resistance contras 
have been carrying out despite the ceasefire which has been 
observed in general terms since march 1988 
but he said war in nicaragua would hurt peace efforts for 
central america as a whole 
in washington presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said the bush administration was waiting and watching to see 
what action ortega takes 
we obviously are urging that the ceasefire be maintained 
he said 
about 11000 contras withdrew to camps on the honduran side of 
the border after the united states suspended weapons and ammunition 
supplies in february 1988 an estimated 2000 to 3000 are in 
nicaragua conducting sporadic attacks 
washington has continued nonlethal aid to the rebels 
under an agreement signed aug 7 in tela honduras by ortega 
and four other central american presidents the contras are to 
disband and be relocated from their honduran base camps by dec 8 
in exchange ortegas sandinista government advanced the date 
for presidential elections to feb 25 and promised political 
reforms including greater campaign freedom for the opposition 
government and contra leaders signed a ceasefire agreement 
march 23 1988 talks broke down the following month but the 
government has declared monthly unilateral ceasefires since the 
temporary truce expired

the cost to employers to pay the wages and 
benefits of workers climbed 16 percent in the third quarter and 
51 percent in the past year with health insurance premiums again 
driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than salaries the 
government said today 
the 16 percent gain was up from a 13 percent increase in the 
julyseptember period last year the 51 percent jump in overall 
compensation costs for the year ended last month was up from 47 
percent for the 12 months ending in september 1988 the labor 
department said 
the departments employment cost index report confirms that 
tight labor markets and rising health care costs are driving up the 
cost of doing business but the biggest wage gains came in the 
government sector where the pricetag for salaries is traditionally 
higher in the third quarter because of new contracts for teachers 
and other public employees wages in the private sector grew at a 
faster rate than last year but the gains have not been as 
pronounced as some analysts have predicted 
excluding benefits costs wages and salaries rose 16 percent 
in the quarter for all civilian workers double the 08 percent 
gain posted in the second quarter with state and local government 
workers posting a 31 percent gain largely because of new 
collective bargaining agreements the wage gains for privatesector 
workers averaged 12 percent in the third quarter up from 10 
percent compared to both the second qyarter and the julyseptember 
period last year 
for the year ended last month wages and salaries for all 
civilian rose 46 percent up from 43 percent for the 12 months 
ending in june and up from the 39 percent yeartoyear gain posted 
at this time last year because of tight labor markets 
particularly in highskilled fields economists have been 
predicting persistent if not dramatic wage inflation 
the wages and salaries for private sector workers were up 44 
percent in the last 12 months compared to 41 percent for the year 
ending in june and 37 percent from october 1987september 1988 
here again the wage gains were greater for state and local 
government workers whose wages and salaries climbed 55 percent in 
the last year up from 50 percent for the 12 months ending in june 
and 47 percent yeartoyear gain posted at this time last year 
salaries for school teachers college and university professors 
and health and hospital workers in the public sector all rose by 
more than 6 percent in the last 12 months the labor department 
said union workers continue on average to make more than nonunion 
workers but the yeartoyear wage gains on nonunion employees were 
nearly double those of union workers 49 percent compared to 25 
percent continuing a sixyear trend 
on paper the data reflected some relief for employers who have 
seen the costs of benefits in general and health care costs in 
particular skyrocket in recent years 
the third quarter increase in benefits costs was 14 percent 
down slightly from the 16 percent posted for the three months 
ending in june the government said 
for the year ended last month the costs of benefits alone grew 
by 60 percent up from 56 percent for the year ending in june but 
down significantly from the 67 percent increase posted last year 
the decline however is almost entirely attributable to the fact 
that the social security tax did not rise this year it rose 50 
percent last year and drove up overall benefit costs

devils night fires flared across the city early 
today despite the efforts of an estimated 30000 patrolling 
volunteers and hundreds of arrests under a curfew intended to stem 
the annual halloween orgy of arson 
at least five families were left homeless by fires overworked 
firefighters took up to 20 minutes to respond to alarms no 
injuries were reported 
police and firefighters refused to release a count of blazes 
blamed on youths who take part in the city tradition of setting 
fires during the three nights culminating in halloween they 
deferred to the office of mayor coleman young whose aides said no 
information would be given until a tally is completed wednesday 
but it was clear that dozens of blazes were set in trash bins 
and abandoned buildings city councilman mel ravitz said today that 
the number of fires was up from last year but was still lower than 
in earlier years 
there has been a great effort made to reduce the number of 
incidents of vandalism or arson he said that we may be up a 
few this year i dont think that means the city is going 
backwards 
as the sun set monday columns of smoke rose from blazes 
scattered through the poor mostly lowrise east side and fires 
glowed orange as darkness fell 
during the past two nights at least 334 youths were arrested 
police said four for investigation of arson and the rest for 
violating the 6 pmtodawn curfew imposed for the period police 
are allowed to detain children under 18 overnight if they are 
caught on the streets without a parent 
one burnedout resident penny thomas blamed devils night 
revelers for the blaze that erupted in an abandoned house next door 
and destroyed her home 
the house just went to burning in the front and me and my 
friends we ran out of the house thomas said the fire kept 
burning and the fire truck hadnt got here yet 
benny braxton a retiree whose home burned this morning said he 
stayed up late watching the abandoned house next door out of fear 
of arsonists before finally going to sleep neighbors roused him 
when his house caught fire 
because that house was empty i had a feeling something was 
going to happen braxton said 
we dont know what started it or who started it but somebody 
definitely started it fire capt amos horton said when a 
place is going like this is going we know it was set 
the peculiar tradition apparently peaked in 1984 when 
firefighters battled 808 fires during the period the number of 
fires has declined steadily and last year there were 229 reported 
devils night blazes 
civilians have joined the battle against arson and this year 
an estimated 30000 people signed up to patrol the streets 
reporting curfew violators and trying to spot fires before they 
spread 
in part the strategy is intended to relieve firefighters of the 
burden of patrolling so they can devote all their time to putting 
out fires 
the fire and police effort was bolstered by other city workers 
who cruised the streets of fireprone neighborhoods in their 
official cars looking for flareups

a nebraska agency will not be allowed to force 
public employees who supervise the mentally retarded to undergo 
testing for aids under a new supreme court order 
obviously im disappointed said don moray director of 
eastern nebraska community office of retardation after the high 
court monday turned aside his agencys appeal to require testing 
we believed in the policy very strongly as a means of 
protecting our clients moray said workers were never tested 
under the policy 
the justices who have never ruled on the lawfulness of aids 
testing let stand decisions that blocked the agency from imposing 
mandatory blood testing of employees who come into direct contact 
with the mentally retarded people the agency serves 
the bush administration urged the court to leave intact a ban on 
the tests imposed by lower courts justice department lawyers said 
the lower court rulings comply with constitutions ban on 
unreasonable government searches and seizures 
in other developments the supreme court 
agreed to settle a dispute in which federal protection for 30 
million american workers pensions could be at stake the court 
will decide what authority the federal pension benefit guaranty 
corporation has to order employers to revive scrapped pension plans 
agreed to decide whether the port authority of new york and new 
jersey and perhaps other multistate agencies may be sued in 
federal courts 
said it will use a chicago drug case to consider expanding the 
authority of police to search homes without court warrants 
was urged during an oral argument session to strike down as 
taxation without representation a federal judges order that 
doubled local property taxes to pay for racially desegregating 
kansas city mo public schools 
heard arguments over a challenge to the partial merger of 
detroits two daily newspapers 
rejected in a virginia case arguments that states must not 
favor the clergy over secular humanists in licensing people to 
perform weddings 
barred a lawsuit against the christian science church by a 
michigan couple whose 15monthold boy died after they as church 
members were counseled to rely on faith healing and avoid seeking 
medical help 
the aids testing case focused on the nebraska agencys 1987 
policy requiring some employees to submit to blood testing for the 
virus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the contagious disease attacks the bodys immune system 
rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
the virus most often is spread through close contact with blood 
blood products or semen from infected persons 
the incurable condition is believed caused by a virus called the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
the nebraska agency said it wants to test its workers because 
retarded clients can engage in violent conduct such as biting or 
scratching an infected worker could then pass on the virus to 
other clients the agency suggested 
but us district judge lyle strom barred the tests when workers 
sued and his ruling was upheld by the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals 
the chief victims of aids have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users although a small percentage of cases is 
attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual 
contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of aug 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 105990 
americans of whom 58 percent or 61655 have died since june 1 
1981 according to the center for disease control no one is known 
to have recovered from aids

the district attorney says he will 
investigate whether jury tampering occurred in the 1964 trial of a 
white businessman in the assassination of mississippi naacp leader 
medgar evers 
it could be that it will take a grand jury investigation ed 
peters said monday the city council voted last week in favor of 
reopening the case 
the council resolution came after published reports said the 
sovereignty commission a nowdefunct state panel established in 
1956 to preserve segregation screened potential jurors to help the 
defense of byron de la beckwith at his murder trial in 1964 
beckwith was tried twice but both trials ended in hung juries 
murder charges against him were dropped in 1969 
documents show that the sovereignty commission described certain 
potential jurors as likely to be fair and impartial one was 
noted as jewish and another as having improper thinking 
fair jurors made the final panel the others did not 
mere background inquiries by the commission do not constitute 
tampering peters said a grand jury would look for evidence that 
jurors were influenced he said 
other legal hurdles remain in the way of reopening the case 
including the right to a speedy trial the district attorney said 
erle johnston former sovereignty commission director said the 
agencys role in beckwiths first trial was unethical but it 
wasnt tampering 
evers an naacp leader who fought to open white schools to black 
children was gunned down in the driveway of his jackson home 
beckwiths fingerprints were found on the rifle used 
beckwith who said during the trial that his weapon was stolen 
could not be reached for comment there is no telephone listing for 
the greenwood businessman in the area 
evers widow myrlie now a los angeles public works 
commissioner said im heartened to know that the interest is 
growing in the possibility of reopening medgars case

as the united states and soviets 
resumed talks at the united nations on reducing chemical weapons 
ground was broken on a windswept plain here on the first plant with 
that goal in mind 
the plant scheduled for completion in 1992 is the first of 
eight planned in the continental united states for dismantling and 
incinerating old mustard and nerve gas weapons many of which date 
from world war ii 
ronald lehman ii the bush administrations chief arms 
negotiator said monday that construction of the 212 million plant 
represented the leading edge of the un talks 2500 miles away 
the facility is 50 miles southwest of salt lake city on a 
sagebrushstrewn corner of the tooele army depot dotted with 
concrete igloos housing more than 40 percent of the nations aging 
chemical stockpile 
lehman and others said renewed negotiations at the united 
nations in new york and talks at the un disarmament conference in 
geneva had bolstered hopes for limiting and ultimately destroying 
old chemical weapons 
both nations have called for the destruction of existing 
chemical weapons but differ on the timetable and the rules under 
which new binary chemical weapons might be manufactured 
binary weapons contain two chemicals that are not harmful until 
combined for use

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge inched ahead 02 percent in september for its second 
consecutive monthly advance the commerce department said today 
indicating continued but slow growth in the months ahead 
the increase in the index of leading indicators designed to 
foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future 
followed an advance of 05 percent in august that was revised 
upward from a 03 percent gain reported earlier 
the oftenvolatile index was unchanged in july and had dipped 
01 percent in june the july figure also was revised down from 
the 01 percent increase originally reported 
analysts said that while the index indicates continued but slow 
growth the immediate future will be a precarious time 
the economy looks very soft right now said bruce steinberg 
senior economist for merrill lynch capital markets in new york the 
next few months will be a period of vulnerability he added 
underlining that concern the commerce department also reported 
that sales of new homes plunged 14 percent in september their 
steepest decline in nearly eight years as interest rates crept 
back to the doubledigit level of the preceding months 
new singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 618000 last month following a 31 percent decline 
in august 
the labor department meantime reported that employers costs 
for wages and benefits of workers climbed 16 percent in the third 
quarter and 51 percent in the past year with health insurance 
premiums again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than 
salaries 
four of the 11 forwardlooking business statistics that make up 
the composite index contributed to the september gain 
the index measuring consumer expectations was the largest 
positive contributor last month and the major cause for the august 
and july revisions the commerce department said 
other positive factors were an increase in the money supply a 
longer average work week and higher stock prices 
the other statistics pointed down led by a decrease in 
manufacturers new orders for consumer goods that was followed by 
a decrease in manufacturers unfilled orders fewer orders for 
plants and equipment faster vendor performance meaning declining 
demand higher initial unemployment claims fewer building permits 
and lower prices for sensitive materials indicating weakening 
demand 
the various changes left the index at 1450 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 so far this year the index has fallen at an annual 
rate of 01 percent compared with an increase of 38 percent for 
the first nine months of 1988 
the economy has been slowing since the federal reserve applied 
the brakes last year to dampen inflation but while inflation 
appears to be abating analysts are concerned the feds grip could 
thrust the economy into recession 
steinberg and other economists point to excessive inventories 
and slackening durablegoods orders including a weaker demand for 
new automobiles as major threats to the economy because both could 
trigger growing unemployment and stagnant growth 
other areas of concern include the nations trade deficit which 
increased in august after falling for two straight months and 
declining corporate profits which could affect stock market prices 
steinberg and lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for 
the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa both noted the consumer 
confidence category as a major positive indicator in the september 
index 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity accounted for much of the years growth so far 
as long as confidence holds up we probably wont have a 
recession chimerine said 
but he and other economists have noted that consumer spending 
has begun to wane and believe it will be substantially weaker in 
the last quarter of the year leading to a decline in manufacturing 
chimerine said hurricane hugo and the northern california 
earthquake could promote the construction industry in the coming 
months as the disaster areas begin to rebuild 
but he also said the possible damage to factories in the areas 
combined with commuting problems of employees getting to work 
could disrupt output 
at this point its difficult to say which might outweigh the 
other but i dont expect any major effect on the economy 
chimerine said

the army today removed 
roadblocks around this town and called off a sixweek campaign of 
raids that was aimed at breaking a tax boycott by palestinian 
residents 
also today masked palestinians hacked to death a 22yearold 
woman and wounded her sister both were accused of cooperating with 
israeli authorities arab reports said 
the operation in beit sahour was the armys first concentrated 
show of force designed to break a palestinian tax boycott such 
civil disobedience has been a key element of a 22monthold 
uprising against israeli rule in the occupied territories 
beit sahour a predominantly christian town of 10000 near 
bethlehem has been a stronghold of the tax boycott 
as soldiers removed blockades about 300 to 400 residents took 
to the streets proclaiming victory and singing the palestinian 
anthem biladi biladi which means my country my country 
we stood up to the army and we won said one resident 
but israels west bank military governor brig gen shaike 
erez also claimed victory saying he was convinced the tax 
rebellion is broken israel radio reported 
for the past six weeks foreign diplomats church leaders 
journalists and most nonresidents have been barred from entering 
beit sahour 
in a series of raids soldiers seized property valued at 15 
million from 398 debtors an army communique said it said 33 motor 
vehicles along with cash and money in bank accounts were seized in 
lieu of taxes 
forty debtors were arrested and 35 were indicted of these four 
were fined 3000 or ordered to spent 180 days in jail the 
military said 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post put the arrest total at 60 
the army communique said that because of the raids tax 
boycotters elsewhere in the west bank had come forward to pay debts 
in defense of the operation which was widely criticized abroad 
the army said it was intended to restore law and order and was 
conducted in an organized and orderly fashion 
the army said it launched the raids sept 20 after 320 residents 
stopped paying their taxes 
the army announcement did not directly address numerous 
published complaints of brutality during the raids but indirectly 
acknowledged soldiers may have confiscated the wrong property in 
some cases 
authorities decided to lift the siege of the town after 
completing seizures of property and arrests of those refusing to 
pay taxes said one security source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in the occupied gaza strip today two sisters who worked at 
nasser hospital in khan yunis were attacked the victims were serya 
el kadi who was hacked to death and sumaya el kadi who was 
seriously injured said arab reporters 
the reporters said both were accused of helping authorities 
identify palestinian youths brought to the hospital with wounds 
from clashes with israeli soldiers 
palestinian activists often give false names to hospitals to 
avoid being arrested later by security forces on the basis of 
hospital reports 
last week five masked attackers fatally stabbed a nurse inside 
nasser hospital they scrawled slogans on a wall accusing the 
victim of collaborating with israeli security forces 
the latest slaying brings to 138 the number of palestinians 
killed by fellow arabs in the 22monthold uprising against israeli 
occupation most were slain as suspected collaborators 
at least 607 palestinians have been killed by soldiers or 
israeli civilians during the revolt and 40 israelis also have died 
in the violence

a gun of choice among colombias drug 
traffickers is the colt ar15 semiautomatic assaultstyle rifle 
say us firearms officials tracing the guns seized in that 
countrys drug crackdown 
most guns traced thus far were delivered either individually or 
in small batches dispelling the notion that huge shipments of guns 
are heading to colombia say officials with the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
the atf said it needs to send agents to colombia permanently to 
get more information on the guns being seized 
my understanding is the colombia officials think that is a 
good way to proceed and drug enforcement administration and 
treasury department officials also support the plan atf director 
stephen e higgins said in an interview monday state department 
spokeswoman catherine shaw said she expects the atf proposal to be 
approved 
colombian president virgilio barco and thencolombian justice 
minister monica de greiff called on the united states in september 
to help halt gun shipments to drug traffickers who declared total 
war on the government after it launched a crackdown in august 
drug traffickers have been held responsible for many shootings 
as well as 237 bombings in the past 10 weeks that killed 33 people 
and injured 222 
during the summer two atf agents went to colombia to help trace 
the guns being used and to train colombians in firearms 
identification higgins said 
thus far the atf has traced 242 of the 700 weapons on which 
colombia has sought information according to atf spokesman jack 
killorin 
the most popular weapon among the guns traced thus far is the 
coltmanufactured ar15 semiautomatic assaultstyle rifle but many 
other weapons also have turned up he said 
they cover the gamut killorin said there are a lot of 
rifles ar15s some mac11s also some traditional colt 45 
pistols and smith and wesson revolvers the single most prevalent 
weapon in the trace is the ar15 
the ar15 was the most popular usmade weapon similar to the 
imported ak47 and uzi carbines that were banned from the united 
states in the spring 
colt industries inc suspended retail sales of the ar15 after 
the bush administration imposed a temporary import suspension on 
the foreignmade semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons in march 
company spokesman mike dunn said today that sales to us 
government agencies and law enforcement continue 
it was unclear exactly how each of the ar15s wound up in the 
hands of the colombians but dunn said we dont sell guns to 
drug dealers 
killorin said the information uncovered thus far rebuts the 
perception that things are leaving the country by huge shiploads 
of thousands of guns thats not true what appears to be going on 
is very widespread small purchases not in any particular organized 
fashion more opportunistic 
typically he said a cocaine cartel employee in florida 
awaiting a big drug shipment might wander into a gun store and 
buy a couple of guns and hand them over to other cartel workers 
who deliver the cocaine he said 
but some cartel employees have sought to buy much larger 
quantities of weapons from atf agents working undercover as 
gunsellers he said 
theyve been approached by people working for one or the other 
cartel seeing what they can pick up he said the buyers 
occasionally have sought to purchase 100 to 200 guns as well as 
things not available for example machine guns 
during the summer customs service officials grabbed 37 rifles 
on an airplane going down to barranquilla colombia he said 
we were able to run down those guns lock up some of the 
purchasers we found they had bought an additional number of guns 
about 150 prior to the bust those guns were not recovered 
one reason the atf wants to base agents in colombia is the lack 
of specific information coming from government officials there 
killorin said 
were hearing reports and the colombians are saying theyre 
seizing thousands of weapons he said were getting lists of 
guns but not the kind of information like these are hot off a 
medellin seizure off pablo escobars boudoir escobar reputedly 
is a leader of the medellin cartel

a mother whose boy died from being forced 
to drink up to nine quarts of water was convicted of involuntary 
manslaughter but cleared of murder after claiming she was trying to 
flush stale sherbet out of his system 
angela west 30 was convicted monday in the 1988 death of 
6yearold christopher west and was sentenced to 12 years in 
prison she could have received the death penalty if found guilty 
of murder 
prosecutors contended ms west and her boyfriend jonathan 
crawford forced christopher to drink the water to punish him for 
eating lime sherbet without permission 
doctors said the water caused the boys brain to swell leading 
to seizures and death 
defense attorneys said the two were trying to get the sherbet 
out of christophers system because it was 3 weeks old and they 
believed it was dangerously stale prosecutors said there was no 
evidence the dessert posed any danger 
we believed like they said that they were trying to flush 
out his system and it somehow went haywire and it was too late to 
realize what was happening said juror belinda lynn 
prosecutor steve balog said he was disappointed in the verdict 
which came after three days of deliberations 
i think it is difficult for the average person including the 
average juror to believe that a mother will d this to her child 
so im sure that was a factor in the case he said 
crawford was found guilty of murder earlier this year and 
sentenced to life in prison

in some areas in part because of government efforts to streamline 
bloated factory payrolls pravda said today

azerbaijan 257 percent in tadzhikistan 228 percent in 
uzbekistan 188 in turkmenia 18 percent in armenia and 163 
percent in kirgizia the newspaper said 
all are nonrussian republics along the southern border of the 
soviet union and all but kirgizia have reported rioting in the 
past six months 
the soviet union has long claimed that unemployment is 
exclusively found in capitalist countries it was only last summer 
that premier nikolai ryzhkov admitted the existence of mass 
unemployment in the soviet union he cited it as a cause of ethnic 
violence 
the communist party newspaper said it is time for the soviet 
union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like 
those in the west 
the article gave no estimate for overall unemployment in the 
soviet union but said an association of the unemployed has cropped 
up that claims the number of jobless is 23 million or 17 percent 
of the work force

the first summit between president mikhail s 
gorbachev and president bush will be an informal meeting to help 
them get acquainted and will not cover any major issues the soviet 
foreign minister said today 
eduard a shevardnadze bristled at the suggestion the unexpected 
meeting will be held so the kremlin can ask for us aid for its 
faltering and shortageplagued economy 
the summit set for dec 23 aboard us and soviet warships in 
the mediterranean was announced simultaneously in moscow and 
washington 
gorbachev is to visit italy from nov 29 to dec 1 
shevardnadze said the superpowers do not plan to reach agreement 
on any specific issue at the unusual meeting on soviet and american 
ships he said the talks are intended to set the stage for a 
fullscale summit in the united states in the first six months 
of 1990 
the upcoming talks between the soviet and american leaders 
will be informal aimed at allowing them to know each other 
better shevardnadze told reporters 
he said the meeting should be regarded as the most important 
stage in preparing negotiations which will take place during the 
official state visit by mikahil gorbachev to the united states 
next year 
of the december summit shevardnadze said i do not doubt that 
this meeting between the two leaders would contribute to broadening 
the changes taking place in the sovietamerican relationship 
later taking reporters questions shevardnadze reacted with 
visible displeasure when asked whether a washington post report in 
todays editions was correct in saying the key element of the 
december summit would be the kremlins quest for american economic 
aid 
i would ask you not to use this term to help the soviet 
economy shevardnadze retorted 
the kremlins current economic reforms are the affair of the 
soviet people alone who seek mutually advantageous cooperation 
in trade and other fields with the americans he said 
this meeting is not directly connected with perestroika 
shevardnadze said 
in brussels belgium manfred woerner the secretarygeneral of 
the north atlantic treaty organization called the summit a 
useful opportunity to discuss and improve eastwest relations 
woerner according to a nato spokesman thinks the meeting is 
clearly of interest not only to the major powers but is in 
the interests of the entire alliance 
shevardnadze refused to identify the naval vessels on which the 
bushgorbachev summit will take place 
bush then presidentelect attended the last meeting of 
superpower leaders in new york in december 1988 when ronald reagan 
was president

president bush today left open the possibility 
he would seek renewed military aid for the contra rebels if 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega calls off the ceasefire his 
leftist government declared 19 months ago 
asked about that possibility at a news conference bush said 
i would reevaluate this situation in a minute if the ceasefire 
is broken 
congress suspended military aid to the contras in february 1988 
and the administration has chosen not to seek additional assistance 
of that kind 
bush spoke a day after secretary of state james a baker iii 
said threats by ortega to suspend the truce with the contras may be 
a prelude to cancellation of national elections set for february in 
nicaragua 
i worry that they the sandinista government may be trying to 
lay a predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold 
elections baker said in an interview monday with the associated 
press 
however ortega insisted monday the elections will be held 
the elections are taking place in nicaragua period ortega 
said speaking through an interpreter in an interview with nbc 
news with contra or without contra they are going to take place 
definitely with war or no war that is elections are taking 
place 
ortega surprised a hemispheric conference on democracy in costa 
rica last friday by announcing that he would cancel a ceasefire 
that the sandinistas and the contras agreed to in march 1988 
however he later modified that by saying he would decide the 
matter today 
at his news conference bush renewed his criticism of ortega 
ive never seen a meeting where all the participants were so 
unanimously against all the outrages of one and were still 
getting messages in here about the outrageous performance of daniel 
ortega he said he reached new embarrassing proportions of 
stepping on it 
the president also seemed to reject a proposal by ortega that 
civil rights leader jesse jackson try to persuade us officials 
and members of congress to convert contra humanitarian aid to a 
program under which the rebels would be demobilized 
bush said the idea had limited appeal 
ortega contends the contras have systematically violated the 
ceasefire leading to the deaths of more than 730 sandinista 
soldiers since it went into effect 
but a senior state department official who briefed reporters on 
monday insisting on anonymity said the sandinista army has 
conducted aggressive and continuing searchanddestroy operations 
against resistance forces since the truce began 
from may through september 1989 at least 105 rebels have been 
killed in such operations he said adding that the contra 
casualties run about 15 to 20 a month since the truce went into 
effect 
in a separate interview former assistant secretary of state 
elliott abrams said he doubts that the contras numbering 2000 to 
3000 inside nicaragua and with minimal supplies would choose to 
take on the 75000member sandinista army 
who believes with those odds the contras would restart the 
war abrams asked 
baker said ortegas threat may reflect his concern that 
opposition candidate violeta chamorro could have a real chance of 
winning if the elections are halfway free and fair 
if there is a chance for democracy to win an election maybe 
the approach hasnt been all wrong baker said answering 
skeptics who contend the administration has not applied enough 
pressure on nicaragua 
baker has softened the reagan administrations policy toward 
nicaragua considerably declining to seek military aid for the 
contras and urging them to refrain from military attacks on the 
sandinistas 
but ortegas view is that despite a central america peace 
process that dates back almost seven years the contras seem no 
closer to being dismantled now than they have at any time 
most are stationed at camps along the hondurannicaraguan border 
but the sandinistas are concerned that the united states could once 
again transform them into an effective fighting force 
the administration view is that they should not be demobilized 
until after the election in order to give the sandinistas maximum 
incentive to make the election process as free and fair as possible

here is the text of president bushs tuesday 
morning statement and news conference 
president bush i have a statement and then i would be glad to 
take a few questions 
president gorbachev and i will meet dec 2 and dec 3 aboard 
us and soviet naval vessels on alternate days in the 
mediterranean our discussions will cover the current international 
situation and developments in ussoviet relations 
and in view of the fullscale ussoviet summit to be held in 
the united states during the late spring or early summer of 1990 
president gorbachev and i have agreed that an interim informal 
meeting at this time would be appropriate 
our talks will be informal in character designed to allow us to 
become better acquainted with one another and to deepen our 
respective understanding of each others views neither president 
gorbachev nor i anticipate that substantial decisions or agreements 
will emerge from this december meeting 
now wait a minute here right first here sorry about that 
q mr president what do you hope to accomplish with this i 
mean is the economy going to be one of the main parts of the 
agenda or do you have arms control what do you think is really 
going to be the agenda youre going to talk about 
a i think there will be talk of a wide array of subjects 
without a specific agenda and this is what i proposed to mr 
gorbachev several months ago after our return from the paris 
economic summit weve been working on this all that time and 
q it sounds like you were stampeded into this because it 
wasnt in the works and you had rejected 
a you mean since july its been in the works 
q has it 
a yeah you just havent been told 
q youre right laughter 
a yeah since july and i made the proposal to mr gorbachev 
and ill say this they immediately and enthusiastically he did 
thought this was a good idea 
q and did you also 
a i made the proposal 
q mr president 
a yeah 
q theres been some speculation that a meeting of this type 
might be intended an idea to revamp the soviet economy are you 
trying to get some ideas together to go to this meeting with some 
type of proposal like that 
a well im sure that now that the meeting is announced there 
will be an awful many suggestions as to the subject we should 
discuss and but theres not going to be an agenda or meeting 
that could be seen to fail or succeed on whether we make agreements 
of this nature thats not what this meeting is about and so the 
president president gorbachev will have been in italy and it 
seemed like a very convenient way to do this but theres not going 
to be theres nothing off the table nothing on it its not 
going to be an arms control meeting clearly the summit will drive 
the arms control agenda 
q mr president 
q how do you assess mr gorbachevs reforms do you think hes 
in trouble 
a i want to talk to him about their economy our economy a 
wide array of subjects and we have ive said over and over 
again we want to see perestroika succeed and they know this 
there hasnt been a disconnect as i answered helen weve been 
talking about this meeting since july 
q mr president mr president could you

league of young democrats had opposed that they collected more 
than 200000 signatures on petitions calling for a referendum on 
the method and timing of such elections 
the groups want the president chosen by parliament after the 
general elections which are to be held by june they say they need 
more time to organize an effective campaign to make their 
candidates better known 
the agreement between the socialists and most opposition groups 
had called for a onetime popular vote to select a president with 
parliament choosing all subsequent presidents 
if hungarians vote in favor of electing a president before the 
parliamentary elections next year the presidential balloting would 
be conducted jan 7 the lawmakers decided today 
the presidency was created by constitutional amendments adopted 
two weeks ago and the offices responsibilities include command of 
the armed forces and calling elections

which dissolved itself at a congress this month the socialists 
promise to end oneparty rule and replace it with constitutional 
democracy

government proposals on a suspended danube river hydroelectric 
project with czechoslovakia hungary has been increasingly at odds

northwest airlines reached settlements today in 
all remaining lawsuits filed by victims families over a 1987 crash 
that killed 156 people 
us district judge julian a cook announced the settlements 
this morning before opening arguments were to have begun in a trial 
of the 145 remaining lawsuits terms of the settlements were not 
disclosed 
eleven suits were settled earlier and a 12th filed by a man 
over the death of the fivemonth fetus carried by his 
flightattendant wife was thrown out 
suits are still pending against mcdonnell douglas corp maker 
of the plane claims by mcdonnell douglas and northwest against 
each other also are unresolved 
the trial was to have determined whether and to what degree 
northwest and mcdonnell douglas were to blame for the crash of 
flight 255 on takeoff from detroit for phoenix lawsuits over the 
crash were consolidated into one case 
the only survivor was cecelia cichan then 4 of tempe ariz

president bush announced today he would hold a 
shipboard summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on dec 2 
and 3 aboard american and soviet naval vessels in the 
mediterranean a similar announcement came simultaneously from 
moscow 
its a chance to put our feet up and talk be the fallout so be 
it 
house speaker thomas s foley questioned by reporters about the 
summit said i think its a very positive thing he also 
expressed his hope that the ussoviet session will stimulate 
greater speed in moving on the arms control proposal 
an early bush meeting with gorbachev could give the 
administration an opportunity to underscore its support for the 
soviet leaders program for restructuring the soviet economy 
baker said in a speech oct 16 that the united states was 
prepared to provide moscow with advice and technical assistance he 
said perestroika presented a historic opportunity to make a 
lasting improvement in ussoviet relations 
in an interview monday baker said gorbachev clearly faces 
some very major problems but baker told the associated press 
it would be a mistake notwithstanding that just to stand pat 
we ought to try and take advantage of what we think is an 
opportunity 
bushs predecessor ronald reagan initially was skeptical of 
soviet motives in arms control negotiations and eastwest relations 
generally but he held five meetings with gorbachev after the 
soviet leader took power in 1985 
baker said at this point there are only nuances of 
differences among senior us officials on whether gorbachev can 
succeed in coping with extraordinary problems as he tries to 
transform the country politically and economically 
calling that a question of durability baker said i dont 
think there is any policy difference in the administration on the 
question of the desirability of the soviet leaders perestroika 
policy 
bakers comments were designed to put to rest the notion that 
differences among top officials were slowing a us response to 
gorbachevs bold approaches particularly in eastern europe 
just last week baker acted to quash a speech by robert m 
gates the deputy national security adviser that took a 
pessimistic view of gorbachevs chances after baker in two speeches 
had set forth the administrations position welcoming the changes 
in the soviet union defense secretary dick cheney has voiced 
reservations similar to those in gates speech 
a decision was made to hold the meeting on two ships in the 
mediterranean said a senior administration official who briefed 
reporters on the condition of anonymity because they wanted it 
informal isolated and to promote the concept of neutrality

published in 1961 with a foreword that began this is a book for 
the servantless american cook who can be unconcerned on occasion 
with budgets waistlines time schedules childrens meals the

i happened to be the right woman at the right time she said 
with modesty noting that john f kennedy had a french chef at the 
white house and more americans were traveling abroad 
suddenly people began considering food with a capital f

charlotte 
as i was looking it did a slow collapse you could hear the 
tears in my voice to cover she told viewers you dont want 
it too stiff 
but the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs and made 
her more familiar 
and since its the good company that counts her advice to 
others who make mistakes dont apologize ever its very bad to 
apologize because people will say that wasnt very good was it

moving faster than a speeding bullet though not 
at all as powerful as a locomotive cbs the pat sajak show has 
begun life anew with a 60minute format 
sajaks latenight talk show begun in january was a relatively 
leisurely 90minute affair that failed to yield nielsen results 
against nbcs tonight show and arsenio halls syndicated talk 
and music festival 
hmm said cbs let us tighten sajak to one hour the network 
even installed a vice president rod perth to oversee the 
retooling 
the result which made its debut monday from los angeles 
indicates that cbs thinks salvation lies in a far brisker pace and 
more high energy 
if so cbs is out of its nut 
sajak tieless and wearing a gray jacket that matched the shows 
gray sofa joked with announcer dan miller about the new format 
said haste is needed but claimed that the hour format is a better 
one 
that done he welcomed joan rivers who recently began her own 
syndicated talk show looking slightly haggard but quite energetic 
rivers commenced a rapidfire string of observations some on the 
tasteless side 
inquiring minds who wanted to know and those who didnt learned 
about her flu attack and gastrointestinal state about breasts and 
what happens to california women whose string bikinis are too 
tight she also said she took marlon brando to marineland for sushi 
she kidded sajak 43 several times about his fiancee before 
assailing just joking of course the ladys character in what 
proved to be her exit line 
enter jazzrock violinist jeanluc ponty he played fast and 
furiously then was grilled by sajak on such issues as why he took 
up violin and his early problems with english ponty talked fairly 
slowly 
the final visitor chicken soup costar lynn redgrave spoke 
quickly of the silliness of censorship and playfully emitted a few 
notsoshocking examples of what some might still consider naughty 
she also said with pride that her 8yearold daughter has two 
lines of dialogue on tonights halloween episode 
censoring herself redgrave said her show is on a network whose 
name begins with the first letter of the alphabet sajak 
casting caution to the airwaves later said the show was on abc 
it was a strained night of fast pace and forgettable chatter no 
doubt it was due to a platoon of network executives who proposed so 
many ideas that the shows suggestion box suffered a double hernia 
sajak may not be to blame for the poor restart of his series 
his manner is lowkey asking him to go supersonic is folly those 
who knew his early tv work in nashville particularly in the 
latemovie announcers booth say he has an ernie kovacs mind 
if thats the case cbs might ask him what it was he did there 
and give it a whirl he might be able to build a following

marmet junior high schools annual 
homecoming event was complete with a halftime ceremony featuring a 
marching band and the crowning of a queen what was missing was the 
football game 
the schools team disbanded several weeks ago after the coach 
quit but that was no reason to cancel the homecoming celebration 
it was already scheduled so we went ahead and held it 
acting principal james dillinger said it would be like not 
having a prom in high school 
last week students led a parade through marmet to the football 
field where a homecoming queen was crowned before hundreds of 
spectators the ceremony ended with introductions of the football 
team 
its a little bit unusual the principal said it would be 
nicer to have a football game

q you say this presummit summit is not meant to bail out mr 
gorbachev politically how about yourself youve been criticized 
by the democrats for being too timid toward eastern europe and 
toward gorbachev helping him with perestroika do you think it 
will help you 
a thats not why were doing it but if that should be the 
fallout so be it weve known what were doing weve been on this 
track for some time ive elected to remain very quiet in the face 
of a good deal of sentiment that we were missing an opportunity 
and that that hasnt perturbed me because weve got good people 
that know what were doing in terms of the soviet union and if 
people see that a little more clearly now so be it thats a plus 
q it seems as though youre going there without any 
initiatives and were trying to read between the lines here if 
thats the case arent you going to be accused once again of being 
timid 
a oh im sure somebodyd politically accuse me of anything i 
mean but thats not the point i think i think i tell you one 
thing our allies will be delighted about this theyve just been 
informed this morning and i guarantee you there will be enthusiasm 
through much of the free world and a lot of the rest of the world 
but look i dont expect to have everybody thats been firing away 
at me up there jump up with joy but i weve just briefed the 
congressional leaders and they seem to be quite enthusiastic about 
this they had not known about it and ive got to let them speak 
for themselves but some who have not been overly supportive in the 
last few days seem to feel this is a very good thing to be doing 
gerry 
q mr president you said a few weeks ago you thought there was 
a good chance to complete a start agreement by the time the real 
summit in the spring or summer comes around are you still holding 
to that feeling are things on track will this meeting though 
its not an arms control meeting push that process along 
a i dont think this meeting will push that process along but 
im still holding to that feeling 
q mr president you said repeatedly that youd like to see 
perestroika succeed 
a yeah 
q what plans if any does the administration have to make sure 
that happens in terms of any kind of economic assistance or 
anything of the sort 
a well we havent been asked for any economic assistance and 
maybe this is one of the items that we will be discussing what i 
want clear to make clear to mr gorbachev and i have done that 
and i dont think theres been a disconnect with the soviets is 
that we do want to see it succeed but well be discussing that 
q let me ask are you also concerned that reforms in the 
soviet union may be moving too quickly and it could result in a 
government crackdown a la china 
a well some have suggested that i am they use a different 
word for it but a little too much on the cautious side i think 
there is reason to be cautious and ive said that over and over 
again substitute the word prudent if you want but i think at 
this meeting at this meeting ill be after this meeting ill be 
better able to answer your question because i know mr gorbachev 
to be a very frank individual just from the contacts that ive had 
with him which have been not as many as some but more than most 
and i think i think that ill be able to give you a better answer 
because thats one of the things i want us to i dont want to 
have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed 
communication tom 
q mr president right before and right after the wyoming 
meetings the guidance from your closest advisers here was that 
there was not going to be a presummit summit and they were 
specifically ruling out a meeting of this sort anytime this year 
now were we being deliberately misled and assuming that we 
werent what changed 
a thats one of the dangers of not telling what you know to 
everybody there could be some disconnect in that but one of the 
benefits is that the soviets see were dealing in good faith yes 
q was there a feeling on your part mr president that perhaps 
waiting for spring and summer was a little bit too long too 
tenuous since no date has been set for spring or summer 
a no because i think they are two separate kinds of meetings 
one of them is to is to one of them announced as it is will 
drive the arms control agenda and the other one is the kind of 
meeting i talked about so i dont its not a question saul of 
thinking if we didnt have this meeting too long would go 
or i remember in 1984 people kept saying ronald reagan hasnt 
even sat down with the soviet leaders they were admittedly 
changing pretty fast in those days but he said that you know and 
people were the critics were on him about it i dont feel that 
that that had anything to do with it well weve got to do it 
sooner because we wont see each other till september i mean 
till you know the summer if thats spring of summer if that 
was your question

east german communist party chief egon krenz 
headed to moscow today to discuss reform proposals with the 
architect of perestroika soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the official news agency adn reported this afternoon that krenz 
had flown to the soviet union but it did not specify when he 
departed 
he was scheduled to meet with gorbachev on wednesday morning and 
hold a news conference in the afternoon before leaving the soviet 
capital adn said 
krenzs first foreign trip east germanys leader began after a 
night demonstrations in nine cities about 500000 east germans 
took to the streets to demand democratic reforms in the largest 
protests in east germanys 40year history about 300000 people 
marched through leipzig 
east germanys largest opposition group today sent a message of 
support to human rights activists in czechoslovakia 
the statement from the new forum opposition group which counts 
more than 15000 members reflected the growing feeling that 
krenzs leadership is serious about loosening restrictions on free 
speech 
we are convinced that new times will come to you too and 
that the prague spring will finally have its summer new forum 
said in a letter sent to czechoslovak human rights activists the 
letter was made public in west berlin 
czechoslovakia began a sweeping program of liberal reforms under 
communist leader alexander dubcek but the socalled prague 
spring was quashed by the warsaw pact invasion of august 1968 
the current communist leadership in prague has strongly rejected 
the need for reforms and has dealt harshly with dissent 
about 10000 people demonstrated in prague on saturday for more 
democracy protesters were beaten by police and more than 300 were 
arrested 
mondays protests in east germany took place in leipzig halle 
schwerin karlmarxstadt cottbus magdeburg dresden poessneck 
and east berlin according to the staterun news agency adn 
activists said marchers demanded that the communist party 
relinquish its monopoly on power witnesses also said the 
protesters carried signs demanding free elections and the 
legalization of opposition groups 
there were no reports of violence or arrests 
the protests of recent weeks followed an exodus of east germans 
to the west since august nearly 70000 many of them young 
skilled workers have fled to the west 
krenz replaced hardliner erich honecker on oct 18 and the 
government has launched an unparalleled campaign of dialogue and 
openness aimed at winning public trust 
in a speech to military academy graduates monday krenz 
reiterated his belief in the communist partys leading role in 
society 
he said the party was at the head of qualitative changes going 
on in society 
krenz has promised changes including freer travel to the west 
and amnesty for people jailed for trying to escape the 
tightlycontrolled society and for those who have succeeded 
he has also declared that east germany has much to learn from 
reforms in the soviet union a major reversal from honeckers 
contention that such changes were unnecessary 
a leader of east germanys communistallied liberal democratic 
party charged monday that the countrys political structure no 
longer corresponds to the will of the people 
manfred bogisch suggested in a commentary in his partys 
newspaper der morgen that the communists leading role would have 
to be won not dictated 
although bogisch said socialism was not at issue in the reform 
discussion he said the communist leaderships policies are now a 
matter of debate 
under east germanys constitution all recognized political 
parties are allied with the communists however the liberal 
democrats have said the other parties should have more independence 
also monday leaders of the countrys governmentaligned trade 
union federation met to discuss a confidence vote called by the 
unions leader 
union head harry tisch who also sits on the ruling politburo 
asked for the vote on his leadership after many young members 
charged the union served only the interests of the government 
neglecting workers needs 
the official adn news agency said a final decision on tischs 
vote had been postponed until nov 17 when the union leadership 
plans to meet again 
the agency reported that some members had already withdrawn 
their support for tisch but that the majority still backed him 
in a statement carried by adn late monday the trade union 
leadership said the nations communist system faced serious 
danger 
however it said it was partly to blame for letting problems 
pile up and pledged to better represent the interests of workers in 
the future

a vietnamese man who escaped from 
his homeland by lashing himself to the rudder housing of a tanker 
for two days in monsoon seas has been denied asylum in the united 
states a senator said today 
the request for immediate asylum was rejected by the state 
department but the immigration and naturalization service will 
allow the stowaway to stay in the country while it reviews the 
request said bill bryant a spokesman for sen claiborne pell 
dri 
bryant did not know how long the review would take 
the polish captain of the tanker has taken up the cause of the 
23yearold man discovered during a routine lifeboat drill two 
days out of ho chi minh city 
i know what living in a closed society is like the captain 
jerzy kolasinski said monday when the man was interviewed here by 
ins officers 
officials refused to release the name of the stowaway who was 
met by immigration officials when the tanker docked at the mobil 
oil co terminal monday he was confined to the ship pending the 
appeal 
the crew of the cypriot tanker success made two checks of the 
ship for stowaways before leaving ho chi minh city kolasinski 
said then on aug 30 they spotted the man perched on a 
makeshift plywood seat on the rudder housing about four feet above 
the water 
he had been exposed to the waves and 100degree heat for more 
than 48 hours while the ship steamed down the saigon river into the 
south china sea the captain said 
the refugee had only a container of water that was almost empty 
a package of cigarettes and a butane lighter and had tied himself 
to the ship with a length of hemp kolasinski said 
this was the monsoon season in the southwest china sea it 
was very stormy and he could have been washed off at any time 
the captain said 
kolasinski detoured to singapore and asked immigration officials 
there to take the man they refused citing their lack of 
diplomatic ties with the communist country he said 
the captain said he also tried seeking asylum for the man in 
bahrain in the persian gulf dubai part of the united arab 
emirates and yambu in saudi arabia 
nobody cared about this man kolasinski said he is 
normal intelligent person and a normal person would not have 
risked what he did for economic reasons 
the man communicating to the polish crew in sign language 
volunteered to work for passage and kolasinski said he was kept 
busy with odd jobs 
the ships insurance agent william w whit a representative of 
lloyds of london said that if the asylum request is denied 
lloyds will be responsible for returning the man to vietnam

q mr president 
a yes maureen let me get there in back 
q mr president but then what changed your mind because this 
is exactly the kind of meeting that you and your aides have been 
saying for months you did not want and it seems exactly the kind 
of meeting that gorbachev given his domestic troubles needs very 
very much what changed your mind and why were you the one 
a my ill tell you what changed my mind on it was 
consultation with our allies the rapidity of change in eastern 
europe the emergence of democracies in this hemisphere and this 
concept that i just didnt want to in this time of dynamic change 
miss something something that i might get better firsthand from 
mr gorbachev yes in the back 
q mr president 
q mr president what made you decide to meet on a ship 
a well we can do it without too much fanfare we can do it 
without where theres a relatively few number of people not a 
lot of crush of bodies out there and a chance to put our feet up 
and talk in the kind of meeting that i have just described for you 
and it will i think its easy logistically for both sides 
q how much time do you think you will spend face to face in 
your mind what do you think its going to take to get 
a a lot a lot and i cant tell you in hours but were going 
to have small numbers of participants on both sides i maybe im 
getting a little ahead of the power curve there but i know thats 
my intention and i think the soviet side has agreed to that and 
itll by doing it in this manner we can have i would say more 
time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint 
appearances things of that nature for public consumption 
q mr president between hemispheric summits and drug summits 
and gorbachev summits and economic summits youre doing a lot of 
mountaineering let me ask you this 
a this one isnt a summit so scratch this one off your list of 
things to worry about ive got to make that point over and over 
again summits take on a definition an expectation of grand 
design and grand agreements and thats not what this is 
q let me ask you about this expectation then about six months 
ago you proposed your conventional force reductions for europe if 
something came through on your sixmonth deadline presumably you 
would want a summit with mr gorbachev to sign it are we going to 
have a third gorbachev summit in 1990 
a no anticipation of it but look well meet as often or as 
little as we need to 
q well how is that going how is the conventional forces thing 
going 
a reasonably well we still have to driving for the best we 
can our alliance to be sure that we keep moving forward to meet a 
rather ambitious time frame dave and then well go back 
q mr president one of the criticisms thats been made is by 
the democrats particularly is that this is a really unique time 
for you that after 40 years of calling for free markets and open 
society that you have chance to perhaps cement some of these 
changes in the eastern bloc in europe and in the soviet union do 
you have some kind of plan or vision for getting that accomplished 
is this part of it 
a were seeing it move arent we were seeing dynamic change 
and i want to handle it properly i want to do whatever the us 
can do to facilitate these kinds of changes you heard what i had 
to say yesterday some of you all did in terms of poland and the 
group were sending over there to help solidify the changes that 
are taking place and ive got a good group of people working with 
me in this administration knowledgeable about europe that assures 
me that we can move this whole process process forward properly 
some things have to the united states cant wave a wand and say 
how fast change is going to come to czechoslovakia or to the gdr 
way in the back carl and craig 
q mr president you say there will be no agreements at this 
meeting is it possible however that you might firm up the date 
for the meeting next year for the official meeting 
a could be could be and i dont want to say that i guess 
maybe i ought to retreat a little and say not saying there would 
be no agreements the meeting is not being set up to achieve 
agreements i would hope wed see eye to eye on certain things when 
we get through and maybe more narrowly define more precisely 
define what differences we have craig and then john

q are we to believe that the leader of the united states and 
the leader of the soviet union will get together and there will be 
no discussion of arms control or what role in this meeting will 
that play 
a i dont know but theres not an arms control meeting 
q mr president 
a yes john 
q you keep talking about the rapid change in eastern europe if 
mr gorbachev would suggest that the united states be more generous 
in aid to hungary to poland and perhaps even to east germany how 
receptive would you be to that idea 
a well weve got weve got an aid package and program and 
id welcome his ideas but i dont think we could we would 
respond to you know his charge on that i think wed have to do 
it what we felt was the right way to do and exactly what i have 
been doing yes 
q mr president over the past several months youve had 
exchanges of letters with mr gorbachev could you tell us if 
theres been a change in your evaluation of him as a person or how 
youre feeling about him 
a no change as ive indicated i have a positive view of him 
to begin with but i havent felt any changes there i will say 
that when i made this proposal there was a very prompt response 
and the only reason its taken time between the july initiative on 
my part and his very prompt response that i think was fired back in 
august has been just working out where and how to do this so ive 
not had occasion to change my view but as you look at the 
different meetings and if you look at the the way this 
relationship is developing there are a lot of positive signs we 
all go back in one capacity or another to times when the rhetoric 
was much tougher where you had a lot of well you had a very 
different approach to openness in the soviet union than you do now 
so i think the relationship is moving in the right direction but i 
still when i say cautious or prudent i think thats the 
way we ought to do it and i will have an opportunity to explain 
that when i see mr gorbachev yes 
q so you think his motivation is what he says it is 
a i you mean do i question his word i think hes committed 
to reform absolutely 
q mr president secretary of state baker has mentioned the 
possibility of technical assistance and advice on the soviet 
state of the soviet economy how far would you be willing to go 
with that kind of thing 
a well again we i dont know how much how far they want 
to go and this is one of the subjects well be discussing way in 
the back 
q what does the administration have in mind 
q mr president theres been a lot of talk around town about 
the survivability of gorbachev especially going into the winter 
months and the prospect of strikes in the soviet union and so 
forth when you say you would like to see perestroika succeed in 
the soviet union do you equate that with the success of gorbachev 
personally 
a i think its tied up in that right now yes 
q and do you think if there is anything that you could do to 
help strengthen his position in the soviet union that you would do 
it 
a well i think weve got to know what it is and but 
this is the kind of discussion we can have i will say this i 
dont think you base the foreign policy of a great power like the 
united states on one personality i dont think you do that i 
dont think that is a prudent way to approach this 
q mr president lets have a domestic summit on some domestic 
problem like health care the high cost of 
a wait im getting criticized for having too many summits as 
it is laughter 
q no you need one on you need one on domestic issues weve 
spent a long time here talking about things when we have a vital 
crucial situation out there catastrophic illness is nothing it 
would not take care of the situation we had a press conference 
here all day yesterday where the canadian government officials got 
up and said in the united states you only have health care for 
the rich not for the poor why cant we have a good system like 
theirs and why cant we have a summit on health care 
a i think what weve got to do is educate the canadians if they 
feel that way because thats not true that is not true and to 
suggest that its true that our health care system is only that 
simply shows i dont know who those officials were but it was 
never raised with me by the prime minister 
q well the health care health minister of canada 
a weve got a lot of problems weve got a lot of problems 
q inaudible that you only have health care in this 
country for the rich and not for the poor 
a well thats where thats a point id argue yes rita

in the time it takes to light a flag the 
courts have their first cases to test a new law outlawing the 
burning of old glory 
gregory johnson the protester whose 1984 flag burning led the 
supreme court to legalize the act was arrested with three other 
people monday as they ripped and burned american flags on the steps 
of the capitol 
capitol policemen tore pieces of a shredded flag from the hands 
of one demonstrator who lit the first flag 
the other protesters unfurled flags and set them afire as all 
four chanted burn baby burn before policemen aimed fire 
extinguishers at the burning remnants bathing the scene in white 
smoke 
they invited the arrest to protest the flag protection act of 
1989 the statute that took effect only saturday the protesters 
were charged with violating the new statute demonstrating without 
a permit and disorderly conduct 
they were transferred to the custody of city police and were 
held in jail pending arraignment on the charges today 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas told the senate 
today that the outrage of a flag burning on the capitol steps 
gives the supreme court a chance to redeem itself from last 
junes blunder 
i hope that gregory johnson is convicted and that this time 
his conviction is upheld by the supreme court dole said and 
i hope that the flag protection act of 1989 does not become the 
flagburners protection act after all the smoke has cleared 
but dole said he continues to believe that the law is nothing 
more than legal hocus pocus that it is grossly overbroad and 
probably unconstitutional and he said he remains convinced that 
the real answer to the flagburning problem is a constitutional 
amendment 
on monday nancy kent speaking for the group made clear they 
intended to test the law congress passed following the supreme 
court decision last june that flag burning as a political protest 
is protected speech under the first amendment to the constitution 
we challenge you miss kent said reading a prepared 
statement arrest us test your statute take it back to the 
supreme court and try once again to claim it is all consistent with 
your constitutional standards of free speech 
also on monday the 1984 charge against johnson was officially 
dismissed in texas by dallas county criminal judge john hendrik 
the dismissal came five months after the supreme court ruling 
overturning his conviction 
hendrik called the dismissal the most distasteful duty of my 
nineyear judicial career and said he did it only because of my 
oath 
and in seattle on monday fbi agents watched as about a dozen 
university of washington students burned us flags to protest the 
new federal law no arrests were made 
david cole who said he represents johnson as a staff attorney 
for the center for constitutional rights in new york city said he 
and his client believe the new law is just as unconstitutional as 
the statute it replaced 
capitol police identified the four persons arrested as johnson 
33 of richmond ind shawn eichner 24 of new york city david 
blalock 39 of johnstown pennsylvania and scott dread scott 
tyler 24 of chicago 
miss kent said blalock is a member of the vietnam veterans 
against the war eichman represents coalition opposed to censorship 
in the arts and johnson is a member of the revolutionary communist 
youth brigade 
tyler stirred criticism in chicago earlier this year by placing 
a flag on the floor as part of a student exhibit at the school of 
the art institute the display asked viewers to describe the proper 
way to display the flag and included a register that was placed so 
writers had to stand on the flag to record their opinions 
the flag law which president bush allowed to take force without 
his signature sparked a series of protest flag burnings in cities 
across the country over the weekend 
it provides punishment of up to one year in jail and a fine for 
anyone who knowingly mutilates defaces physically defiles 
burns maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any flag 
of the united states 
bush questioned whether the new law meets constitutional tests 
and favors a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the 
flag

a major underground nuclear weapons test 
measuring 58 on the richter scale rocked the nevada desert today 
and sent shock waves as far away as this gaming capital 105 miles 
from ground zero

richard m nixon told deng xiaoping on tuesday 
some chinese leaders had lost respect in the united states and 
deng accused washington of involvement in the democracy movement 
that chinas army crushed in june 
chinas 85yearold senior leader told the former president that 
china has not done one single thing harmful to the united 
states in the past decade according to xinhua the official 
chinese news agency 
a member of the nixon party who attended the meeting between 
deng and the american leader who opened the door to china in 1972 
characterized their conversation as a a very tough 
noholdsbarred exchange 
nixon also met with communist party chief jiang zemin on tuesday 
about the tragedy of the military crackdown on studentled 
dissent the american informant said 
nixon told deng he had observed relations closely for 17 years 
and there has never been a more difficult crisis than at the 
present time 
he said it was important to discuss differences and repair the 
damage that has been done to the respect in the united states among 
chinas friends for some of chinas leaders 
he did not identify those leaders deng premier li peng and 
president yang shangkun have been singled out for ordering the june 
attack on prodemocracy demonstrators in which hundreds perhaps 
thousands of people were killed 
according to xinhua deng said the united states was involved 
too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion the 
governments terms for the democracy movement 
china was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove china 
for it he said 
deng and nixon who was on the fourth day of a private visit 
agreed that ideological differences should be overcome and 
relations improved on the basis of common strategic interests 
im very much in favor of your view regarding statetostate 
relations deng said to nixon as they met at the great hall of 
the people you should focus on the strategic interests of a 
country and you should not talk about historical roots or 
differences in ideology or the strength of a country 
nixon has urged the governments to bury their differences over 
the crushing of dissent and mend their frayed relations 
washington suspended highlevel contacts and arms sales after 
the june attack china has repeatedly accused the united states of 
trying to subvert its communist system and criticized the americans 
for harboring dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian in 
their beijing embassy 
after the meeting with deng nixon said he was optimistic the 
uschinese relationship will be sustained and those that are 
signalling its death are much premature 
when he made his first trip to china in 1972 nixon said 
there was hardly anything we agreed upon we disagreed about 
korea we disagreed about japan we disagreed about vietnam we 
disagreed about philosophy 
today we have a profound disagreement about a very tragic 
incident but that disagreement is not going to derail the 
relationship if we could do it in 72 we can do it now 
deng praised nixon for ending the 194972 freeze in relations 
and said what youve done deserves our admiration and interest 
nixon spent two hours with jiang zemin the man deng chose as 
party chief after the reformist zhao ziyang was purged in june 
their topics included the crackdown political and economic 
reform in china the status of chinese students at home and in the 
united states the soviet union and reform in eastern europe the 
nixon staff member said 
president nixon encouraged the chinese to consider a number of 
measures that would improve the climate for sinoamerican 
relations the informant said without elaboration 
nixon is the most prominent american to visit china since june 
he leaves on thursday and is expected to report to president bush 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commenting on the visit 
monday said the united states wanted normal relations but 
conditions still were not right

more than 1000 people have lined up for 
hours to see the fate of teenage drug abusers in a haunted crack 
house in this rural town where the police chief says no real 
cocaine dens exist 
since this eastern shore village of 2000 opened its halloween 
attraction late last week children and adults have mobbed the town 
square to enter the house of horrors in the former county jail 
on monday evening the night before the final performance the 
line started forming 1 hours before the first show 
they say its real spooky they say its going to scare you to 
death its supposed to teach you a lesson randy robinson a 
high school student from nearby grasonville said as he waited to 
get in 
some of them go through two or three times i dont think its 
just that its such a good scare i think people just like whats 
going on in there said leon demby a volunteer who portrays 
mr cocaine in one scene some people think this should have 
been done a long time ago 
visitors tour 11 stations starting with a courtroom starring a 
reallife judge and ending with a graveyard where actors in black 
costumes and white makeup beg for help from their tombs 
the show was organized by and stars dozens of local government 
workers members of civic groups and high school drama club 
members who rallied around the idea proposed by police chief john 
lechliter 
every time you pick up a newspaper what do you see crack 
crack crack lechliter said this is a drug abusers odyssey 
if you will 
he supervised the planning of the program which begins outside 
with a police helicopter zooming over the crowd to shine its 
spotlight on a young man selling drugs to a teenage girl real 
police burst out of the bushes the man pulls out a pistol and the 
officers fire shotguns loaded with blanks 
groups of 12 are then led through the house by figures dressed 
as ghosts and ghouls to witness the pairs arraignment and scenes 
of children confessing their drug addictions to parents in one 
room a teenager succumbs to her friends cajoling and takes a 
fatal drug overdose 
in the next room the feeling of being under the influence of 
crack a highly addictive form of cocaine is portrayed by flashing 
strobe lights and loud thumping sound effects then comes an 
emergency room scene the morgue and the graveyard 
even lechliter who said he thought the performance might give 
children nightmares was unprepared for the macabre fascination the 
attraction aroused on the first night organizers said more than 
600 people showed up to take the halfhour tour and nearly half 
had to be turned away 
on saturday lechliter said he had to stop people from joining 
an even longer line an hour after the house opened even so 
volunteers gave tours until after midnight 
the house received national attention and even attracted a film 
crew from japan cub scouts arrived by bus from kentucky and 
pennsylvania 
in a small town this is the biggest thing thats ever 
happened said elaine pratzner owner of centrevilles video 
store 
residents including lechliter say drugs do not pose a major 
crime problem in centreville which is 40 miles southeast of 
baltimore but they say the danger should not be taken lightly 
are there drugs in town yes is it a big problem no except 
that any drugs are a problem lechliter said were proactive 
were out to prevent it 
after the tour two youngsters scooted away when asked if they 
considered the presentation frightening their mother followed them 
theyre too scared to talk she said before disappearing 
into the night

q mr president turning to nicaragua for a minute today or 
yesterday president ortega now suggests that rev jackson be used 
as an intermediary to talk about redirecting the us humanitarian 
aid so it can be used to demobilize the contras what would be your 
thoughts on having rev jackson involved between us and nicaragua 
and are you in any way thinking of refocusing the aid from the 
united states 
a that suggestion has limited appeal for me laughter 
q i wonder i wonder if you it might help to enlist 
secretary gorbachevs support in encouraging reforms in some of the 
more reticent eastern europe states like eastern european states 
like east germany 
a i want to discuss it with him again im not suggesting 
given his public statements that he is going to be the one that 
controls what happens you know in every detail in czechoslovakia 
or east germany but it is a subject that we should discuss just 
as im sure hell want to discuss changes in this hemisphere here 
or others so i think that will come up 
q would you expect them to look favorably upon upon your 
request for a little help a little pressure maybe 
a a little pressure on what 
q well a little pressure on the leaders of east germany 
perhaps to lighten up on people who want to leave 
a well well have a chance to discuss all of those things and 
thats one of the good things about it there will not be a certain 
agenda on it well simply sit down and ill give you my views on 
the changes that are taking place in eastern europe and certainly 
im most interested in getting his yes frank 
q mr president a twopart question first of all after you 
meet gorbachev will you take the opportunity since youll be in 
the region to then meet with and brief allied leaders and solicit 
their comments and secondly why did you hold this deliberation so 
tightly you said you wanted to show the soviet union good faith 
but why not involve the bureaucracy your administration as you 
know has been criticized 
a because i knew exactly what i wanted to do and i knew how i 
wanted to go about doing it and thats why i didnt need to i 
didnt need the advice of others in this particular subject matter 
i knew how i wanted to do it i knew that i wanted to get the 
summit the arms control summit set and i also knew that i wanted 
to after the discussions i told you about to go forward with 
this and i wanted to deal in good faith with the soviets because 
until it was firmly locked i should not be in a mode of committing 
them to this kind of a meeting and i think all that worked and i 
hope what weve done is to develop a certain confidence in the 
soviets as a result of these negotiations confidence is important 
if youre going to have frank exchanges then you have to have a 
certain degree of confidentiality but on this one i told you who 
was involved in it i was getting good sound advice how they got 
the information on which to advise me why thats their business 
but i felt no deprivation of being deprived from information at 
all kathy 
q how about the first part though sir meeting with the 
allies afterwards 
a no plans to do that this is going to be done if you look 
at the calendar like over a weekend and of course well be in 
full contact with them after that but i dont plan to jump from 
country to country after the meeting kathy 
q mr president one of the summits capital s on your 
agenda is the economic summit have you made a decision and are 
next weeks elections in houston in any way a factor in why you 
havent announced it so far 
a no those elections have no relevance to the decision and 
no the decision has not been made yeah 
q mr president you say you have confidence in the soviets 
what assurances do you have that you wont be surprised by 
something mr gorbachev might bring to the table its widely 
believed that president reagan was somewhat sandbagged in reykjavik 
a hes free to bring anything he wants theres no agenda but 
theres the idea that arms control we might be surprised on 
arms control i dont worry about that because weve got an 
understanding that the already announced summit meeting will handle 
those items 
q do you have any indication he has anything in particular he 
wants to bring 
a i think hes anxious to do what im anxious to do right now 
and so i dont i dont 
q well would you would you handle any arms control issue he 
might raise by simply trying to defer it right at the spot

chinas legislature tuesday passed a law on 
public demonstrations including tough provisions banning rallies 
that infringe upon state interests or social order 
the law on assembly and demonstration to take effect 
immediately was passed on the final day of the current session of 
the national peoples congress standing committee 
the official xinhua news agency said the law is aimed at 
protecting citizens legal rights to gather parade and demonstrate 
while safeguarding social stability and public order 
but the final version revised during three sessions of the 
standing committee since july provides the state wide latitude to 
stop public gatherings that may be critical of government policy 
authorities have the right to turn down requests for rallies 
that may endanger public safety and cause social turmoil 
demonstrations that go against chinas constitution sovereignty or 
territorial integrity or incite national separatism will not be 
allowed 
the ban on separatist gatherings would apply to tibetans who in 
the past two years have staged violent demonstrations against 
chinese rule 
the law says no state employees can organize or take part in a 
gathering if such action conflicts with their terms of employment 
one revision to the law added that citizens cannot organize or 
participate in rallies in cities where they dont live 
other provisions say demonstrations must not hinder the 
activities of state affairs that rallies must not violate social 
morality or use instruments that create excessive noise and affect 
the normal life of residents and that assemblies must not use 
words or pictures to insult and vilify other people 
written applications for demonstrations must be submitted to 
police prior to the event and the authorities must make a decision 
two days before the date of the demonstration the police are 
empowered to take any necessary measure to disperse illegal 
gatherings 
several chinese cities including beijing and shanghai invoked 
demonstration codes after students took to the streets in 
prodemocracy marches in 198687 the regulations stipulated that 
all demonstrations must be approved by police but since then 
almost all requests for rallies have been rejected 
the state council chinas cabinet began discussing the draft 
of the national aw on may 30 several days before the military 
moved in to end the studentled prodemocracy movement seven weeks 
of the biggest spontaneous demonstrations in communist chinas 
history

police on tuesday defended their 
truncheonswinging attack on antikgb protesters by accusing them 
of rioting and 69 people were detained 
monday nights melee marked the toughest official treatment of 
an unsanctioned gathering in the soviet capital in more than 1 
years it followed a candlelight vigil outside kgb headquarters to 
commemorate stalins victims 
a splinter group of about 500 people chanting slogans against 
the soviet secret police set off for pushkin square where human 
rights demonstrations often take place 
they were attacked by police and scores of protesters were 
knocked to the ground beaten and dragged into waiting police buses 
it was an unsanctioned demonstration and police had to break 
it up said gen georgy v postoyuk chief of moscows public 
order department they used force as there was no other way to 
make the people stop rioting 
he said in an interview that 69 protesters were detained one 
was given a 15day jail sentence tuesday by an administrative 
judge while others got seven or fiveday terms or fines postoyuk 
said 
witnesses said police attacked without warning and the 
demonstrators had been peaceful 
the tass news agency said the protesters were trying to create 
as much disruption as possible to display antisoviet posters and 
shout antisoviet slogans 
many were members of the democratic union a group founded to 
challenge the political monopoly of the communist party and create 
a westernstyle parliamentary democracy in the soviet union 
about 1000 people converged on kgb headquarters on dzerzhinsky 
square after dusk to mark the unofficial day of the political 
prisoner and mourn the millions wrongly imprisoned or killed 
under dictator josef stalin 
two rows of people holding candles lined up on three sides of 
the building home of the infamous lubyanka prison where under 
stalin political prisoners were executed with a shot to the back 
of the head 
the hourlong peaceful vigil was organized by the memorial 
society which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustly 
under stalin and the democratic union 
at the end of the vigil the splinter group of mostly young men 
marched toward pushkin square 
chanting shame on the kgb and the kgb is the enemy of 
the people the group was confronted without warning by riot 
police two blocks from pushkin square as they passed out leaflets 
to homebound commuters 
the whitehelmeted police armed with long black rubber 
truncheons formed a line then waded into the protesters clubbing 
at least four of their leaders to the ground then dragging them 
into nearby buses for detention 
the demonstrators retreated then formed again and headed to 
gorky street which leads to pushkin square riot police and other 
uniformed officers sealed off the square and split the protesters 
into two groups 
on gorky street riot police again charged the demonstrators 
taking about six into custody as the protesters were dragged to 
the buses spectators shouted shame shame several passersby 
spat at a police car 
another group of demonstrators gathered on the southeast side 
of pushkin square was also repeatedly charged by riot police who 
ignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporters 
who flocked there 
police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gathered 
under a gorky street archway and dozens were seized and dragged to 
the buses 
the brutal treatement meted out to protesters was especially 
jarring because of the greater tolerance for dissenting points of 
view that had seemingly become official practice in moscow under 
mikhail s gorbachev 
in december 1987 about 200 men in civilian clothes roughed up 
jews who staged a protest demanding the right to emigrate on the 
eve of gorbachevs departure for his washington summit with ronald 
reagan

government troops broke through a 
guerrilla blockade on the salang highway on tuesday to allow trucks 
carrying food and other necessities to reach the capital 
about 100 privately owned trucks carrying rice and cooking oil 
entered kabul from the highway the government said it was the 
first land convoy to reach the city in 10 days and more trucks 
were expected wednesday 
soldiers said government trucks had yet to come down the highway 
because of fears of a guerrilla ambush 
the salang is the main supply route to the capital from the 
soviet border and fighting along the road the past 10 days has 
left the city short of food fuel wood and other important items 
in order to show the army was in control of the areas around 
kabul reporters were taken south of the city to the site of a 
battle last week between the sovietbacked government and the 
usbacked moslem guerrillas 
an officer from khad the afghan security agency said 70 
government soldiers disguised as guerrillas sneaked into a 
guerrilla hideout in a rocky ravine and attacked 
he said 22 guerrillas and one government soldier were killed 
several hundred usmade sacher rockets aimed at kabul were 
confiscated along with mortars land mines and other weapons 
according to the khad officer 
since june rocket attacks on kabul have killed about 400 
people the government blames the guerrillas the guerrillas deny 
rocketing civilian targets and say the government is firing on its 
own people so it can accuse the guerrillas 
rocket attacks had intensified in recent days but witnesses 
said only two hit the city tuesday no casualties were reported 
government spokesman mohammed nabi amani said more than 200 
guerrillas were killed in the fighting on the salang 
most casualties occurred when the government fired two 
sovietmade scud missiles at the highway on friday amani said 
amani said the government tried to negotiate with guerrilla 
leader ahmad shah massoud who he said organized the highway 
blockade he denied massouds claim that soviet pilots were helping 
afghan troops in combat 
the soviet government said it pulled the last of its soldiers 
from afghanistan in february in accordance with a unmediated 
accord 
however the bush administration said this month it is likely 
russian soldiers are operating the scud base in the darluman region 
outside kabul 
traffic was light throughout the day in kabul because of the 
gasoline shortage the international airport opened all day tuesday 
after rocket attacks forced it to close temporarily monday 
the guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust the 
sovietbacked government and set up an islamic republic in 
afghanistan soviet troops intervened in december 1979 and began 
withdrawing in may 1988

center for 400 vietnamese boat people despite the objections from 
residents

contempt from residents in the sai kung area who staged 
demonstrations at the site for nine days in august until police 
hauled them away

thought the center would pollute a nearby reservoir 
the center circled with a 15foot fence with barbed wire will 
hold 7000 people when it is finished in two months

peace corps director paul d coverdell said 
tuesday the agency has embarked on talks that could lead to sending 
75 to 100 american volunteers to poland next year 
coverdell who has just returned from a visit to poland and 
hungary said a threemember peace corps team will go to warsaw in 
late november to continue talks with polish officials about 
establishing a program there 
we would characterize our discussions at this point as 
preliminary but i found great enthusiasm for the idea when i was 
in warsaw last week he said i personally would like to see 75 
to 100 volunteers there in 1990 
in july during a visit to eastern europe president bush 
announced in budapest that peace corps volunteers would be going to 
hungary marking the corps first effort in an eastern european 
country that program is to involve about 60 volunteers to train 
hungarians in the teaching of english 
coverdell went to poland after signing a memorandum of 
understanding in budapest that paves the way for starting the peace 
corps program in hungary 
he told a news conference that english teaching also was among 
prime interests expressed by polish officials during his talks in 
warsaw 
today most professions particularly those dealing with 
science and technology require a strong grasp of the language 
he said english also is the primary language of commerce so we 
intend to expand our programming in this area throughout the 
world 
while he was in poland coverdell also talked with several 
government ministers about establishing peace corps programs there 
dealing with the environment health and small business development 
we want the peace corps to respond to any country that is 
requesting legitimate assistance he said i particularly want 
the peace corps to be on the cutting edge in nations where in the 
past there has been a lack of communications mixed with tension and 
suspicion i believe we can make a difference in situations where 
these currents of change are flowing 
coverdells trip also included talks dealing with peace corps 
programs in the philippines and thailand 
in manila he met with president corazon aquino and discussed 
the possibility of sending peace corps volunteers back to the 
southern island of mindanao volunteers were withdrawn from 
mindanao four years ago because of threats to their security from 
communist insurgents

a well weve indicated that thats the law and we will live by

way the congress has moved on this i dont think i need to repeat 
my view on capital gains its something that is good for growth 
something that is good for investment something that is good for 
jobs and we hear some shrill comments to the contrary but in my 
view that matter was debated fully my position was made clear and 
i plan to continue to fight for my position 
mixed questions from the press 
a who hasnt had a question im getting out of here right 
here and then ellen and then im leaving no right here 
q on minimum wage is your proposal your original proposal 
still your first and final offer or would you be willing even to 
link it with something like capital gains which you want so badly 
a were not in the in the posture of trying to tell the 
congress how they ought to resolve these difficulties we sent up 
clear proposals on the anticrime package on the minimum wage on 
the capital gains and it has gotten so confusing up there that 
they ought to move now but im not going to suggest why do we 
need to do that weve told them what we want and i wish theyd 
get some action going on the proposals that i have put forward i 
think the american people are entitled to that i think the 
american people see that it is this congress that is frustrating 
getting the deficit down and so they ought to move and move 
promptly but i cant sit there and fine tune for them well if 
youll only make this one throw this one issue in with that one 
why you can do your business i mean weve tried 
q so youre saying package deals are out 
a well im not saying theyre in or out im saying lets get 
going we know what the administration position is ive said it 
send it down the way i said it and we got harmony and light send 
it down differently and ill take a look at it send it down with 
some things in it that i cant take and ill send it right back to 
you and i dont know how more frank i can be with the congress 
ellen and then im leaving 
q mr president as recently as this summer some of your 
senior advisers dare i say some in this room were expressing 
doubts that gorbachev would survive all of his internal political 
difficulties did you ever share those views and has anything 
happened what has happened to turn you around 
a look we are looking at everything we can regarding the rapid 
changes that are taking place not only in eastern europe but in the 
soviet union and weve got very thoughtful people outside the 
government that give me their opinions and i dont think anybody 
has a corner on all the wisdom but i cant speculate on that 
question what i can say is were not basing the foreign policy of 
the united states on any individual weve got to look at broad 
changes weve got to look at commitment from all elements of 
leadership in the soviet union where they come down fascinating 
meeting the other day with mr primakov here and assess all of 
this and spell out as clearly as you can whats in the interest of 
the united states and the alliance and this meeting will help in 
that regard but its not predicated our whole arms control 
agenda just as on mr gorbachev similarly i dont think they 
you know do that on a us president at the time 
q but sir you wouldnt be meeting with him of course if you 
thought he was a goner laughter did you at any time have any 
doubts inaudible 
a a goner no i dont laughing i dont laughing 
that word never entered my mind so you know you hear a lot of 
cross currents about how successful perestroika is going to be but 
one thing you get from all the soviet leaders is look the clock 
isnt going to be set back and we are going to go forward with 
perestroika whether it was mr yeltsin when he was here or mr 
gorbachevs statements and visits with shevardnadze visits with 
mr primakov and then others meet with other layers of the soviet 
bureaucracy and you get the distinct feeling that the clock is not 
going to be set back to square one and then you go forward 
well heres how this will interact with us policy but im 
looking forward to this meeting i think its the right thing to be 
doing as i say there was a time when i wasnt sure that it was 
but with this rapidity of change i dont want to miss something 
and the way weve got it set so there will be no firm agenda where 
we can do it in a setting without a lot of public pressure from 
other governments i think its going to be a productive meeting 
and i was very pleased with the reception that it got from the 
congressional leaders as i say i expect we will get a strong 
positive response i know i will from the allied leaders and i 
really cant think f any country that is going to see objection to 
this because they the fate of a lot countries are wrapped up in 
how the united states and the soviet union get along and how the 
changes in eastern europe and the soviet union are managed and 
when i come back from this meeting i and my top advisers and 
were going to keep our traveling squad down i say well be able 
to well be able to have a much clearer perception of motivations 
behind mr gorbachevs pronouncements so i think its worthwhile 
thank you all very much 
q there was a very important development inaudible can 
you address it 
a no i cant ive got a im sorry 
q they passed a law sir they passed a law to make it 
a dont know anything about it 
q thank you 
q whats ortega stepping on laughter 
q where will they be meeting where is he going to stay 
staff we dont know yet we dont know yet

new home sales took their steepest dive in 
nearly eight years last month while the governments chief economic 
forecasting gauge registered only a small increase the government 
reported tuesday 
analysts said they anticipate sluggish growth ahead but few 
said they see danger signals of a recession in the near future 
despite the sharp decline in home sales economists forecast 
improvement in that industry as mortgage rates decline 
the commerce departments index of leading indicators designed 
to foretell economic activity six to nine months in advance inched 
up 02 percent in september 
at the same time the department reported new home sales dropped 
14 percent the sharpest decrease since a 19 percent decline in 
january 1982 during the last recession 
in a third report the labor department said employers costs 
for wages and benefits of workers climbed 16 percent in the third 
quarter and 51 percent in the past year with health insurance 
premiums again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than 
salaries 
many housing economists questioned the september home sales 
report and suggested a more accurate reading of the industry would 
be obtained by averaging sales of both new and existing homes over 
the entire third quarter 
that shows overall strength in the housing market said john 
a tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors 
analysts see falling mortgage rates leading to continued but 
slow growth in the housing industry for the remainder of the year 
similar to that projected by the leading indicators for the overall 
economy 
the economy has been slowing since the federal reserve applied 
the brakes last year to dampen inflation but while inflation 
appears to be abating some analysts are concerned the feds grip 
could thrust the economy into recession 
the small increase in the leading index followed a revised 
august advance of 05 percent the oftenvolatile index was also 
revised in july to show no change after dipping 01 percent in june 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co called the 
september figure the fourth anemic report in the last five 
months and said it signals a major slowdown a flirtation with 
recession 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said this number gives us a pretty good assessment 
of where we stand no recession but at least two quarters of 
sluggish growth said 
an index measuring consumer expectations was the largest 
positive contributor among last months leading indicators and the 
major cause for the august and july revisions 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity has accounted for much of the years growth so 
far 
as long as confidence holds up we probably wont have a 
recession lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the 
wefa group in bala cynwyd pa said he and other economists 
believe consumer spending will be substantially weaker in the last 
quarter of the year however 
other positive contributors were growth in the money supply due 
in part to lower inflation a longer average work week and higher 
stock prices 
but the other seven statistics mainly in the manufacturing 
sector pointed down a decrease in manufacturers new orders for 
consumer goods a decrease in manufacturers unfilled orders fewer 
orders for plant and equipment faster vendor performance meaning 
declining demand higher initial unemployment claims fewer 
building permits and lower prices for sensitive materials 
indicating weakening demand 
the strong service and consumption sectors and the weakness in 
manufacturing led chief economist david berson of the federal 
national mortgage association to describe the economy as having a 
split personality 
the various changes left the index at 145 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 so far this year the index has fallen at an annual 
rate of 01 percent compared with an increase of 38 percent for 
the first nine months of 1988

a state licensing board under fire for 
clearing an optometrist who had women patients strip to the waist 
for eye exams today ordered him to stop the practice and put him 
on three years probation 
the iowa board of optometry examiners had previously voted 
against disciplining monticello optometrist gary fisher but 
reconsidered under public pressure 
the board after a 2hour private meeting voted without debate 
or dissent for probation and ordered fisher to halt the screening 
tests that had the women disrobe fisher already had said he was no 
longer performing the examinations 
fisher was hauled before the licensing board on ethics charges 
after some women patients complained he had them partially disrobe 
fisher said he did so to check for curvature of the spine 
associated with some eye disorders 
in its ruling last month the board said fisher was honestly 
attempting to provide the best care 
the decision prompted an uproar angering some women pitting 
health professionals against each other and raising questions about 
closed meetings of medical regulators 
it was kind of like a foot doctor looking at the brain said 
sen jack nystrom 
the board reconsidered after attorney general tom miller and the 
board that governs the medical profession asked for the case to be 
reopened the medical board had threatened to sue saying fisher 
strayed into the practice of medicine for which he isnt licensed 
fisher complained about being hounded by reporters before all 
sides stopped commenting on the advice of lawyers who expect the 
issue will eventually land in court 
the board after 20 hours of hearing two full days 
exonerated me completely said fisher now im being retried in 
the press 
the optometry panel is made up of five optometrists and two 
members of the public all appointed by gov terry branstad after 
initially giving the board a vote of confidence branstad urged 
another hearing 
heres a situation where the optometry board is now on trial 
and i think its appropriate for them to see all of the evidence 
before they make a decision he said

los angeles countys 13 family planning 
clinics are closing this week because of budget cuts ordered by 
gov george deukmejian 
program directors and health workers predicted the closings 
wednesday could result in more than 5000 additional unwanted 
pregnancies each year and hurt efforts to stem the spread of 
sexually transmitted diseases 
the clinics offer gynecological exams pregnancy counseling 
birth control and testing for venereal disease they do not offer 
abortions 
officials said women seeking such services most of them poor 
and hispanic will be referred to the countys 29 general health 
clinics which also provide family planning but patients sometimes 
must wait up to eight weeks for an appointment 
the countys 42 clinics have provided family planning services 
to 60000 women a year 
in july deukmejian cut twothirds of the states 362 million 
family planning budget the maximum cut permitted by law he has 
suggested that californias rising teenage pregnancy rate proves 
the program has failed 
its a horrific situation said catherine j wylie a 
administrator of family planning programs the women at the 
highest risk will be the ones most affected and by the time 
theyre screened theyll already be pregnant 
counties that use less state money to operate their family 
planning programs including san diego will not be as drastically 
affected by the cuts as los angeles 
still san diego county health officials said they planned to 
eliminate breast and cervical cancer screening for poor patients 
among other services 
abortion opponents on monday backed the cuts 
these clinics have long been used as a cover and funnel of 
money for the abortion industry said brian johnston western 
director of the national right to life committee

the army took down the 
barricades around this palestinian town tuesday ending 42 days of 
seizing cars furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott 
jubilant residents took to the streets to shout victory 
but as hundreds of he townspeople waved v signs and sang 
military authorities said they had succeeded in breaking the 
revolt seizing the equivalent of more than 15 million to make up 
for unpaid taxes 
we are always collecting taxes we have always collected 
taxes we are the authorities said brig gen shaike erez head 
of the west bank military government 
hanan banura a 25yearold mother of two whose husband is in 
jail for refusing to pay taxes said the towns defiance 
strengthened the 22monthold palestinian uprising against 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
we won something here she said we did what we wanted to 
do not what they wanted 
the bulldozers that pushed away the earthen mound blocking off 
the christian arab town of 10000 people ended beit sahours 
unlikely role as a symbol of the revolt against occupation 
it is a town of large prosperouslooking homes of sunbleached 
stone located down steep winding roads from bethlehem until 
recently its middleclass residents were derided as rich 
revolutionaries by poor palestinians in refugee camps who fought 
israelis with stones and firebombs 
of the more than 600 palestinians killed in clashes with 
soldiers or civilians in the uprising only one died in beit sahour 
but beit sahour known mostly for the fields where shepherds 
first learned of christs birth kept up the boycott of israeli 
taxes ordered by the plobacked leaders of the uprising long after 
most other palestinians gave in to israeli pressure 
much to israels consternation the tax revolt has gotten as 
much publicity as the uprisings persistent violence journalists 
who sneaked into beit sahour described refrigerators rugs cars 
televisions and all manner of goods being hauled away 
on one side townspeople complained against taxation without 
representation on the other israel claimed it was seizing goods 
only to collect taxes to support schools roads and other services 
meron benvenisti a former deputy mayor of jerusalem who has 
researched the west bank for 10 years alleged in 1986 that israel 
collected more taxes than it spent on the territory since it and 
the gaza strip were captured in the 1967 middle east war 
the army magazine bamahane said in its most recent edition that 
people in beit sahour owed about 500000 in taxes but the extra 
goods were seized to cover transport and storage 
on tuesday townspeople ranging from youths honking car horns to 
businessmen claimed their revolt delivered a rebuke to israel 
chakib awad owner of a factory that makes bakery machinery and 
metal statues of christ for sale to tourists said beit sahour 
showed it had a role in the revolt 
at my age i dont throw firebombs he said i am not a 
terrorist 
awad showed a list of 18 machines he said had been seized from 
his factory which he valued at 69250 
he said that before the uprising he had paid taxes to israeli 
authorities or the jordanian government when it controlled the west 
bank but he added he no longer wanted to pay occupiers 
i am not a jordanian any more i am not an israeli he said 
i am a palestinian i have to pay taxes to a palestinian state 
israeli officials said that debts from 398 major tax debtors 
were handled in the sixweek campaign and that confiscated 
goods included 33 cars as well as bank accounts and cash 
a statement by military officials said soldiers also arrested 40 
tax debtors thirtyfive have been indicted 
we have realized what we wanted to accomplish and more said 
erez 
not all israelis agreed seven leftwing israeli legislators who 
visited the town monday on condition they not take journalists 
along said tuesday the tax campaign was a failure 
lova eliav a labor party legislator described the campaign 
against beit sahour as a futile foolish exercise the army 
has turned elite soldiers into tax collectors 
legislator dedi zucker of the citizens rights movement said 
what happened in beit sahour was a fight over who is a sovereign 
and it has not been proven israel is a real sovereign in beit 
sahour

wages and salaries boosted by teacher pay 
raises jumped 16 percent from july through september double the 
increase of the previous three months the labor department 
reported tuesday 
while some economists discounted the increase because of the 
special factors relating to the start of the school year other 
analysts called the wage gain a worrisome indication of underlying 
inflationary pressures 
the 16 percent increase in wages and salaries in the 
departments employment cost index followed a gain of 08 percent 
in the apriljune period 
the biggest wage gains in the past three months came in the 
government sector where the pricetag for salaries is traditionally 
higher because of new contracts for teachers at the start of the 
school year 
teacher contracts also were a major factor in pushing wage rates 
up by 13 percent in the julyseptember period last year 
the gain in wages and salaries excludes the cost of other 
benefits paid by employers such as health care when those costs 
are added total employment compensation rose 16 percent in the 
past three months up from a 11 percent advance in the apriljune 
quarter that advance was also higher than a 13 percent rise in 
the julyseptember quarter a year ago 
both the wage and salaries increase and the total compensation 
increase are uncomfortably high said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
some analysts blamed the higher wage gains on the sharp 
increases in consumer prices that occurred at the first of the 
year they said that new wage contracts were an effort by workers 
to keep their purchasing power from being eroded by inflation 
consumer prices have moderated in recent months as food and 
energy costs have returned to more modest levels but analysts said 
the real danger will be if the earlier spurt of higher inflation 
gets embedded in wage demands setting off an inflationary 
wageprice spiral 
the effects of higher inflation earlier in the year are 
showing up in new contracts said michael evans head of a 
washington forecasting company the question is can it be turned 
around 
sinai said the federal reserve is paying particularly close 
attention to wage pressures in the economy and wont consider its 
war against inflation won until these increases begin to moderate 
for that reason he said he wasnt looking for any significant 
move on the part of the central bank toward lowering interest rates 
for the 12 months ending in september wages and salaries rose 
by 46 percent up from a 39 percent increase in the previous 
12month period total compensation costs rose 51 percent for the 
past 12 months compared with an increase of 47 percent for the 12 
months ending in september 1988 
the costs of benefits alone grew by 6 percnt in the past 12 
months compared with a 67 percent increase posted for the same 
period ending in september 1988 
however the smaller rise in benefit costs was attributable 
almost entirely to the fact that the social security tax did not 
rise this year after climbing by 5 percent in 1988 
wages and salaries for private sector workers were up 44 
percent in the last 12 months compared with a 55 percent increase 
in wages for state and local government workers 
salaries for school teachers college and university professors 
and health and hospital workers in the public sector all rose by 
more than 6 percent in the last 12 months the labor department 
said

karleduard von schnitzler who belabored 
imperialists revisionists and assorted capitalist villains on east 
german television for nearly 30 years has lost his job to creeping 
reform 
east germanys most prominent tv commentator said farewell 
monday on the final edition of his 20minute weekly show the 
black channel he was unrepentant as befits a man born into a 
titled prussian family 71 years ago 
no matter that countrymen came to revile him as a symbol of the 
cold war philosopy used to justify decades of harsh rule 
no matter the joke that said schni represented the 
shortest time span in east germany just enough to turn off the 
television as it was uttered 
i have nothing to be ashamed of schnitzler told his 
audience monday night grimfaced as ever 
revisionism is still with us and the class struggle 
continues said the man who once declared proudly that no one 
has ever proved a falsification in his broadcasts 
revisionism to schnitzler is something practiced by west 
germany his regular target he helped found a west german radio 
station soon after the country was divided at the end of world war 
ii but later returned to east berlin 
since egon krenz became communist party chief two weeks ago 
succeeding 77yearold erich honecker the statecontrolled media 
have undergone a dramatic transition 
oncedrab newspapers are filled with debate and complaints about 
the nations problems the two tv channels have begun carrying 
everything from illegal street protests to investigative reports on 
government bungling and excess 
schnitzler however remained steadfast true to the old line 
only last week he said east germany faced the biggest offensive 
from the enemies of socialism in its history 
many influential people inside the communist party as well as 
the general populace had come to view the black channel as a 
shrill anachronism 
proreform demonstrators shouted schnitzler to the muppet 
show 
after 1519 episodes of invective since 1960 during which he 
often showed west german tv reports followed by biting commentary 
schnitzler got five minutes for his farewell 
he told viewers he would continue his television work in 
another fashion and pledged to be as always a weapon in the 
defense and development of my socialist fatherland 
there had been increasing signs the end was near for schnitzler 
a clear liability to a government professing willingness to 
consider reform 
his program no longer fits with the times the official news 
agency adn reported a week ago 
a lutheran church publication said his unrelenting orthodoxy 
contributed to the flight of tens of thousands of east germans to 
freedom in the west and to the frustrations behind mass 
prodemocracy protests

prime minister benazir bhutto faces 
her biggest government crisis this week in a noconfidence motion 
that grew out of brutal ethnic violence and has won support from 
some of ms bhuttos onetime allies 
the motion goes to the floor of the national assembly on 
wednesday and must be voted on by thursday 
ethnic violence in this nation of 109 million people has chipped 
away at ms bhuttos power base turning the slums of pakistans 
largest city into virtual war zones and creating a big business in 
illegal arms 
ms bhutto is confident her leftofcenter pakistan peoples 
party will survive the vote but some observers fear that whatever 
the outcome it could ignite new violence 
ms bhuttos party has 116 seats in the national assembly and 
needs 119 votes to survive the confidence motion and she said it 
can easily muster three votes from independents and minority 
parties 
nor a single ppp member will join hands with the opposition 
ms bhutto said last week 
opposition spokesmen say at least 129 assembly members will vote 
against the government so far 105 have pledged to do so 
the opposition islamic democratic alliance blames the ethnic 
violence on ms bhuttos populist party saying it refused to take 
a tough stand to decentralize power or to spend money to improve 
the welfare of the masses 
ms bhuttos major opponents are sindh nationalists from ms 
bhuttos native sindh province who want a loose federation or 
outright independence and mohajirs indian immigrants to 
pakistan since the partition of the two countries in 1947 
fourteen assembly members who announced they will vote with the 
opposition belong to the mohajir nationalist movement which until 
recently supported ms bhuttos 10monthold government 
the lawmakers announced their defection oct 24 claiming the 
peoples party failed to deliver on promises to provide more jobs 
and to free mohajir political prisoners 
more than 700 people have died in mohajirsindhi riots in 
karachi the nations largest city and in hyderabad and other 
sindh cities since 1986 
the province was the only one ms bhuttos party won handily in 
november 1988 elections 
we are scared that if the motion is carried sindhis will hold 
the mohajirs responsible for overthrowing a sindhi prime 
minister and if its defeated then there will be jubilation by 
ppp workers which could lead to violence said rifat ali khan an 
industrialist in karachi where many of the 9 million people live 
in filthy slums 
as a group urban mohajirs economically are better off than the 
natives they say this makes them the target of poorer less 
educated sindhis the majority of whom are fiefs of rural feudal 
landlords 
only a quarter of sindhs population is mohajirs but mohajirs 
account for 80 percent of karachis population we are on the 
verge of being converted into a minority on our own soil said 
hafiz pirzada a spokesman for the sindh national alliance a 
grouping of sindhi organizations 
the problem has created a huge illegal arms market in sindh 
weaponry is smuggled in from northern pakistan where skilled gun 
craftsmen churn out arms ranging from assault rifles to grenade 
launchers 
according to unofficial estimates there are more than 300000 
illegal weapons in sindh

two newly hired irancontra prosecutors should 
be disqualifed from handling the criminal case against john 
poindexter because they could have seen his televised congressional 
testimony poindexters lawyers argued tuesday 
richard beckler told a federal court hearing that independent 
counsel lawrence walsh violated his offices own procedures by 
hiring dan webb in september to head the prosecution team against 
poindexter who was president reagans national security adviser 
another member of the poindexter prosecution team howard pearl 
a longtime colleague of webb was hired a few weeks ago 
at the hearing webb disclosed he plans to call 46 witnesses in 
the governments case including former national security council 
aide oliver north who in may was convicted of three felonies in 
the irancontra scandal 
webb also said many of the same witnesses from the north case 
will be called when poindexter is put on trial webb did not 
elaborate the witnesses at norths trial included former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane rep lee hamilton dind and 
former attorney general edwin meese iii 
north worked in 1985 and 1986 for poindexter who is charged 
with conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts 
of making false statements the alleged crimes occurred in 
connection with norths secret resupply operation to the nicaraguan 
contras and in regard to a shipment of hawk missiles to iran in 
1985 assisted by the cia 
walsh set up elaborate regulations in 1987 to insulate his trial 
lawyers from being exposed to the immunized congressional testimony 
of irancontra figures including poindexter 
webb a former us attorney in chicago has been in private law 
practice and so has undoubtedly been tainted by poindexters 
nationally televised testimony beckler suggested 
this almost borders on bad faith beckler told us district 
court judge harold greene who has set jan 22 to start 
poindexters trial 
here you have a prosecutor who has built a chinese wall to 
block off the taint and then he has gone out and hired people 
to go around the chinese wall or go through it or under it 
beckler complained it makes a complete mockery of the process 
webb has filed an affidavit saying he didnt watch or read 
poindexters immunized congressional testimony 
webb offered to undergo questioning by beckler in greenes 
courtroom on the question of exposure to immunized testimony and 
greene indicated he would take webb up on the offer 
a supreme court ruling says that no portion of a criminal case 
may be derived from a witnesss immunized testimony

newspaper pravda said tuesday 
it said the time had come for unemployment insurance and 
retraining programs like those in the west 
the kremlin has claimed for generations the soviet union is a 
workers paradise and unemployment exists only in capitalist 
countries which deliberately keep many people out of work so 
factory owners can dictate low wages 
only last summer did premier nikolai ryzhkov admit to serious 
unemployment in the soviet union citing it as a cause of ethnic 
violence 
pravda did not estimate total unemployment but said a newly 
formed association of the unemployed claimed 23 million people 
17 percent of all soviet workers did not have jobs 
chiding a factory manager for the comment i wish i had a 
couple of jobless outside my gates pravda said he meant 
obviously that at his enterprise productivity would jump quality 
of production would increase and discipline would strengthen 
the paper called that a dubious conclusion because those who 
were working would have to support those who were not 
it quoted one reader as saying he did not want unemployment in 
the soviet union and another who said our indignation is in the 
fact that thousands of drunks thieves and simple beggars who dont 
want to work will receive unemployment benefits 
pravda said unemployment was at 276 percent in azerbaijan 257 
percent in tadzhikistan 228 in uzbekistan 188 in turkmenia 18 
in armenia and 163 in kirgizia all are nonrussian republics 
along the southern soviet border and all but kirgizia have reported 
riots in the past six months 
although those figures represent about 43 million people 
pravda said the real reserve of ablebodied workers who could be 
involved in industry in these regions amounts to about 3 million 
that would put the overall jobless rate for those republics at 
roughly 15 percent 
plenty of jobs are available pravda contended but they either 
carry no prestige or are too far from population centers 
chronic labor shortages exist in areas of the far north and 
siberia that are rich in resources but have harsh climates workers 
are paid bonuses to live there 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reform program 
soviet factories are being asked to earn profits this year and 
are starting to count every kopeck pravda said 
the party paper said 3 million people had lost their jobs to 
restructuring and predicted that number would quintuple by the year 
2005 
it acknowledged the communist tradition of job security has a 
lowering effect on productivity and added that to simply find a 
place for everyone is both expensive and immoral

the president said tuesday that 
rebels must withdraw from newly occupied regions of northern 
ethiopia before negotiations with the government can be held 
the statement appeared to cast doubt on reports that talks would 
begin saturday in rome between the government and the rebel tigre 
peoples liberation army 
the rebel army has scored a string of victories since august 
pushing government forces out of the rebels home province of tigre 
and making significant gains in neighboring wollo and gondar 
provinces 
president haile mariam mengistu did not mention the rome talks 
in his address to an emergency session of the shengo the national 
parliament he said the rebels must withdraw quickly from wollo 
and gondar before any negotiations begin 
the shengo called the emergency meeting to hear a report on the 
growing rebel threat 
the tigrean rebels have been fighting the marxist government 15 
years another northern rebel group in eritrea province has been 
fighting a war of secession for 27 years 
the central committee of the ruling marxist party convened an 
emergency meeting monday to discuss the rebel problem it was the 
first in the committees fiveyear existence 
mengistu told legislators one of the foremost tasks is to 
strengthen the armed forces through recruitment and training 
ethiopia has the largest standing army in subsaharan africa 
with an estimated 315000 regular troops and a peoples militia 
that includes everyone 1850 years old 
the president also said that to meet the dangerous challenge 
in northern ethiopia all development projects approved for the 
198990 fiscal year will have to be suspended and the national 
budget put on a war footing 
the tigre rebels said late last week they had agreed to open 
preliminary peace talks with the government in rome on saturday 
with italian officials acting as observers the government has not 
commented on that report 
the talks would come two weeks before another round of talks set 
to begin nov 18 between the government and the eritrean peoples 
liberation front 
the tigre rebels claimed tuesday the government staged a 
30minute air raid on the tigrean provincial capital of mekele 
damaging 20 houses but causing no casualties 
on monday the rebels said 31 people were killed or injured and 
30 homes destroyed in a government air raid on the same city

new home sales fell a dramatic 14 percent last 
month the government reported tuesday but analysts said a truer 
and more optimistic picture of the housing industry would be 
obtained by averaging sales over several months 
many economists also predicted mortgage interest rates would 
continue to fall leading to some improvement in the industry but 
as one said no major resurgence 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618000 units in september 
compared to 719000 units in august the sharpest drop since a 19 
percent decline in january 1982 during the last recession 
the august sales had been revised sharply downward from 758000 
but still approximated the level in july when sales gained 146 
percent to an annual rate of 742000 units 
the september numbers reflect a market correction from 
extraordinarily high sales activity in july and august that could 
not be sustained said chief economist john a tuccillo of the 
national association of realtors 
buyers flooded the new home market last summer when mortgage 
rates started falling and as a result borrowed sales from 
september 
a better measure is probably gotten by averaging the three 
months agreed chief economist david berson of the federal 
national mortgage association that shows that home sales picked 
up in the third quarter primarily because of a decline in mortgage 
rates 
analysts had credited the july advance to a decline in 
fixedrate mortgages to 981 percent by the end of that month from 
a peak of 1122 percent last march 
but rates edged back up to 1022 percent by the end of august 
and remained in that range throughout september according to 
surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said rates should continue to fall between now and 
mid1990 resulting in further improvement in the housing industry 
but no major resurgence 
the realtors reported last week that sales of existing homes 
rose 43 percent in september to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 363 million units the highest level this year 
new home sales for the first nine months were down 45 percent 
from the same period in 1988 
sales fell 356 percent in the northeast in september after 
declining 109 percent the previous month they were off 157 
percent in the south after a 53 percent gain in august and 98 
percent in the west following a 17 percent rise the previous 
month sales in the midwest were unchanged after falling 244 
percent in august 
in another report tuesday the realtors said an index measuring 
the ability of the typical american family to buy an existing home 
rose in september to the highest level in six months reflecting 
both falling home prices and relatively stable mortgage rates 
the national association of realtors said its index rose to 
1047 meaning that a family with a median income of 33248 had 
1047 percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced existing 
home costing 93400 
the median means that half of the families earn more and half 
less or that half the homes sell for more and half for less

the admission that four people were wrongly 
convicted for an ira bombing 14 years ago has brought demands for 
reviews of other convictions based solely on confessions 
since the guildford four were exonerated oct 19 the rev 
ian paisley and other protestant leaders in northern ireland have 
demanded a second look at the convictions of four members of the 
ulster defense regiment for murder in 1983 
irish prime minister charles haughey was among the first to call 
for a review of the case of six irish men convicted of killing 21 
people in a pub bombing in birmingham in 1974 
the guildford appeal coming on the heels of revelations that 
officers in the midlands force had altered confessions and that 
some police in kent had solicited false confessions has raised 
fresh questions about the adequacy of laws on police procedure 
it would appear that large sections of britains various 
police forces are out of control conor gearty a professor of 
law at cambridge university wrote in the irish times after the 
guildford convictions were thrown out 
but barrie irving director of the police foundation believes 
parliament has done as much as it could do in laying down 
safeguards in the police and criminal evidence act of 1984 one 
provision of that act will require all interrogations to be 
taperecorded by 1991 
however irving said in an interview there could be more 
training on the positive ethical values in police work 
simply saying that the legislation is in place doesnt mean 
that there isnt an ethical problem in policing at the moment he 
said 
on monday the home office announced preliminary compensation of 
80000 each for gerard conlon 35 patrick armstrong 39 and 
carole richardson 32 who were freed after their convictions in 
the guildford bombing were quashed paul hill 35 who is free on 
bail pending appeal of a separate murder conviction in northern 
ireland was given 16000 
the convictions of conlon and armstrong for a pub bombing in the 
london suburb of woolwich were also thrown out after the court 
heard evidence that police had lied about their statements 
douglas hurd then the home secretary also ordered a review of 
the convictions of conlons aunt annie maguire and six other 
members of her family on explosives charges 
statements by conlon and hill were instrumental in convicting 
the seven they included conlons father who died in prison the 
other six have since been released 
both the udr and birmingham cases were raised in the house of 
commons in the hours after the guildford four were exonerated 
the one person who brought the vital evidence has now stated 
publicly that she was forced by pressure from the security forces 
to make false statements paisley said 
james hagan noel bell winston allen and neil latimer all 
members of the locally raised british army unit were convicted in 
1986 of the nov 8 1983 murder of adrian carroll near his home in 
armagh northern ireland 
latimer had been identified by a woman as the killer but she 
later recanted her testimony the four claim their confessions were 
made under duress 
hurd told paisley the udr case was a matter for authorities in 
northern ireland 
he also opposed reopening the birmingham case because it had 
been reviewed by an appeals court in 1987 
in that review hurd said the court hearing lasted for more 
than a month and it spent five days considering the crucial point 
about the validity of the confessions 
in the guildford and woolwich cases there were subsequent 
confessions of responsibility by members of an ira gang 
in the birmingham case there have been no such confessions to 
authorities chris mullin who wrote a book on the birmingham case 
in 1986 said he interviewed three men who admitted involvement 
mullin a member of parliament has not identified those men 
over the weekend retired detective constable fred willoughby 
who arrested five of the six men expressed doubts about their 
convictions 
i am deeply concerned that those men could be detained in 
prison for the rest of their lives while there is some doubt in the 
case the independent newspaper quoted willoughby as saying 
willoughby said the men made no effort to escape and he said 
details of their stories that he checked turned out to be true 
however he said the men initially concealed the fact that at the 
time of their arrest they were traveling to belfast for the 
funeral of an ira man killed in england by his own bomb 
advocates for the birmingham defendants were heartened by the 
guildford case 
the case has exposed fundamental flaws in the british judicial 
and appeals system said andrew puddephatt general secretary of 
liberty formerly the national council for civil liberties 
a review of the birmingham case puddephatt said is essential 
to reassure members of the irish community who increasingly feel 
they cannot get justice in british courts

west germany has awarded its 
highest medal for civlians to a dutch woman who helped hide anne 
frank from the nazis the west german embassy said tuesday 
miep gies is being given the federal cross of merit first class 
because of her crucial role in hiding the world famous jewish 
diarist and her family the embassy said 
mrs gies 80 worked as a secretary in the amsterdam canal 
house where the frank family took refuge from 194244 she and her 
husband henk smuggled food to them while keeping their existence 
secret for two years 
in recent years she has toured west german schools to talk 
about her wartime experiences 
in spite of her experiences with germans she has eliminated 
the word hate from her vocabulary the embassy said adding the 
medal will be presented by ambassador otto von der gablentz on 
friday 
by awarding the decoration the west germans are showing they 
want to come to terms with the wartime past mrs gies said in 
an interview its a little late though 
mrs gies plays a prominent role in miss franks diary in which 
she is called miep van santen because miss frank used pseudonyms 
for many people in the book 
born in 1929 in germany miss frank and her family fled to the 
netherlands from nazi persecution in 1933 only to be caught upin 
the persecution of dutch jews during the 194045 german military 
occupation of the netherlands 
along with her father mother sister and four other jews miss 
frank hid behind a secret door in the rear annex of the building 
where her father otto had run an importing firm 
the hiding place was discovered by the germans in august 1944 
and miss frank died at the age of 15 in the bergenbelsen 
concentration camp in march 1945 one month before its liberation 
by allied troops 
for most of the postwar period mrs gies avoided publicity 
but in 1987 she published her memoirs anne frank remembered 
the story of miep gies who helped to hide the frank family 
the medal is a token of humanity which i want to share with 
everybody who helped jewish fugitives mrs gies said its no 
merit of ours that anne frank of all people ended up hiding with 
us

at an unprecedented meeting of nato 
and warsaw pact lawmakers tuesday a polish delegate accused the 
west of lacking the vision of postwar america that gave rise to the 
rebuilding of western europe 
western participants said too much has transpired in 40 years 
for the west to launch a similar recovery plan for nations like 
poland and hungary 
members of the polish hungarian and czechoslovak parliaments 
are taking part for the first time in a session of the north 
atlantic assembly the advisory body of lawmakers from the 16 
nations of the north atlantic treaty organization meeting through 
thursday 
the assembly decided at its annual meeting in rome last month 
that lawmakers from the two dominant military alliances should 
discuss how to enhance security while europe undergoes sweeping 
changes 
the czechoslovaks ignored western slaps at their brutal 
dispersing of demonstrators in prague over the weekend hungarians 
and poles used the session to seek western support for reform 
programs 
we need a marshall plan said jacek szymanderski a 
solidarity member of polands parliament and deputy head of the 
defense committee he referred to the financial aid program drafted 
in 1947 by us secretary of state george c marshall that 
underwrote the recovery of warravaged western europe 
you dont have the vision that marshall had for the future of 
europe szymanderski told the nato delegates 
the polish delegate and hungarys parliamentary defense 
committee chairman laszlo gyuricza argued that their nations 
should be viewed as potential allies and trading partners and that 
western aid should be directed toward their eventual integration 
us and west european leaders have pledged generous financial 
aid to poland and hungary as they take steps toward democratic 
governments and marketoriented economies 
west german chancellor helmut kohl will visit poland next week 
bearing more than 1 billion in debt relief and financing for new 
projects 
the east european lawmakers complained western efforts are 
unfocused 
we want more than economic assistance we would like a 
political guarantee that you have a concept that integrates us into 
western europe szymanderski said 
western participants suggested their aid will fall short of the 
easts expectations 
we dont see the possibility to combine the two economic 
systems claudegerard marcus of the french parliament said 
good will is not enough to solve the problems 
heinrich vogel head of the west german governments institute

europe differ greatly from western europe in the late 1940s and

parliament on tuesday elected premier 
turgut ozal president for a sevenyear term opening the way for a 
change of government under a new premier he will select 
in a session boycotted by all 155 opposition members of 
parliament 263 deputies from ozals ruling motherland party voted 
for him 
fethi celikbas the only other candidate and a member of ozals 
party received 14 votes 
ozal 62 was elected on the third ballot after having failed 
to muster the required twothirds majority of 300 votes in the 
first two ballots oct 20 and oct 24 a simple majority was 
sufficient on the third ballot 
in a brief speech after his election ozal thanked the 
parliament and said the election of a president from within the 
legislature was a victory of democracy in turkey 
ozal became turkeys first civilian president since 1960 and the 
first premier to move up to the highly respected but ceremonial 
post 
ozals premiership automatically came to an end with his 
election he also has to resign his party membership 
deputy premier ali bozer will serve as caretaker premier until 
ozal names a deputy from his motherland party to form a new 
government 
ozal takes over from president kenan evren when his term expires 
nov 9 
the president has little executive power he can veto 
legislation but parliament can overturn his vetoes he can refuse 
to appoint cabinet ministers suggested by the premier but this 
authority has been used sparingly in the past 
the president can be impeached only on charges of high treason 
and otherwise is not accountable for the use of his executive 
powers he cannot be reelected to a second term 
analysts said ozal who has had heart bypass surgery wanted the 
less strenuous job for reasons of health and political prestige 
hours before the presidential balloting ozal polled deputies 
from the motherland party on the choice of the future premier he 
submitted 18 names all parliament members and many included in his 
cabinet and asked deputies to choose four names they favored as 
well as four they opposed the result of the poll has not been 
disclosed 
the list included deputy premier ali bozer foreign minister 
mesut yilmaz finance minister ekrem pakdemirli justice minister 
oltan sungurlu communications minister cengiz tuncer former 
education minister hasan celal guzel and former finance minister 
kaya erdem 
ozals candidacy drew protests from his own party as well as the 
opposition four deputies from the motherland party resigned from 
their party and not all members of the 285member motherland 
parliamentary group voted for him 
a gallup poll published by the national daily sabah on saturday 
showed that only 27 percent of respondents supported an ozal 
presidency another poll published by the daily hurriyet showed 
support of 193 percent 
the opposition citing the stinging defeat of ozals party in 
nationwide local elections in march has said the election of ozal 
as president would be against the spirit of the constitution if not 
its letter 
they also claimed that ozal the first premier attempting to 
become head of state could not be the nonpartisan president 
required by the constitution 
the opposition parties did not name a candidate of their own 
saying he had no chance in view of the motherland majority in the 
450seat parliament 
the military traditionally active in presidential politics 
stayed out this time

the white house helped 500 local school 
children celebrate halloween tuesday and along with the treats the 
kids got an admonition from president bush to beware of something 
truly scary illegal drugs 
bush and wife barbara the first family of ghosts and 
goblins as emcee and tv weatherman willard scott called them 
emerged through the mouth of a 15foot jackolantern erected over 
the staid diplomatic entrance of the white house 
the white house collected pledge cards from the children 
foreswearing drugs 
you know they say that theres a ghost in this old house and 
the most famous one is abraham lincoln said bush barbara and 
i havent seen the ghost of abraham lincoln walking the halls but 
this is our first halloween in the white house so maybe well see 
him tonight 
the president said halloween is a time for ghosts and 
goblins for haunted houses and scary stories 
but there is one scary story that isnt makebelieve he 
said you know what im talking about illegal drugs and how 
they hurt people how they hurt families hurt kids some of them 
just like you 
he read a letter from a 5th grade girl named ana zamora at 
pickard school in chicago 
dear president bush 
i never go outside because my mom gets scared that i will get 
hurt because of the gang fights i have heard that you are 
pushing for a war on drugs please help remove drugs from our 
neighborhoods i will do my part by saying no to drugs and i hope 
you can do yours i know this is hard but you can do it 
bush promised we will do our best 
the kids decked out in their own halloween costumes left the 
white house with loot bags and starfish pins to remind them of the 
story bush told last month in a lunchtime address to students about 
the war on drugs 
in that tale an old man asks a young boy why he bothers to 
throw starfish back into the ocean when there were millions drying 
up and dying on the beach it cant make any difference at all 
the old man says 
the boy just throws another starfish back in saying it makes 
a difference to this one 
it showered briefly on the white house halloween spectacular as 
it was billed but for the most part the leaden skies held their 
rain until bush was back inside and the children were on their 
buses 
even some secret service agents came garbed as clowns while the 
children disported themselves as ghouls caped crusaders 
princesses warriors and even one lad who came wearing a george 
bush mask 
the bushes were joined at the festivities by 3yearold 
granddaughter marshall dressed as a turtle as well as her mother 
margaret bush and marilyn quayle wife of the vice president

a former revolutionary guards minister 
was installed as irans new navy commander tuesday amid a major 
shakeup in the military 
the transfer of ali saleh shamkhani to the regular forces 
underlined the unity of the islamic republics defense forces said 
irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 
khamenei who is commanderinchief of irans armed forces 
appointed shamkhani on monday to replace rear adm mohammadhussein 
malekzadegan 
shamkhani 34 was an urban guerrilla during the 1979 islamic 
revolution and commanded several successful military operations 
during the eightyear war with iraq shamkhani was made a rear 
admiral 
at a ceremony in tehran khamenei told shamkhani he was promoted 
because of his valuable services and great endeavors in the 
scenes of war and victorious missions and the sensitive duties in 
the islamic republic guards corps an account of the ceremony was 
carried on the official islamic republic news agency which was 
monitored in cyprus 
malekzadegan commanded the iranian navy for the last three years 
of the war with iraq before fighting was halted in august 1988 when 
a united nationssponsored ceasefire took effect during his 
tenure several key iranian warships were sunk or damaged in 
battles with the us navy in the persian gulf 
tehran radio announcing the move monday quoted khamenei as 
praising the great strides made by the 14500man navy under 
malekzadegan 
it gave no reason for his abrupt dismissal but several ranking 
officers in the navy were arrested earlier this year for spying for 
the cia 
they and other alleged cia agents are scheduled to make public 
confessions saturday the 10th anniversary of the storming of the 
us embassy in tehran on nov 4 1979 
iraq said two iranian gunboats fired on an iraqi tug last week 
in the persian gulf killing a crewman malekzadegan who was 
conducting naval exercises in the waterway at the time denied the 
incident occurred 
irna said tuesday that malekzadegan has been appointed an 
adviser to khamenei a move seen as a demotion 
he is the highestranking officer to lose his post in the 
shakeup launched by khamenei the key ally of president hashemi 
rafsanjani amid a major rearmament program following the 
ceasefire 
khamenei made major changes in september in the command of the 
350000member revolutionary guards corps under mohsen rezaie who 
has been the forces military chief since 1982 
he also appointed hassan firouzabadi 38 deputy chief of the 
armed forces headquarters as army chief of staff sept 28 and 
named brig gen ali shahbazi chief of the joint staff of the armed 
forces 
the shuffle followed the merger this year of the revolutionary 
guards ministry and the defense ministry which oversees irans 
regular forces to streamline the chain of command 
shamkhani was named revolutionary guards minister in 1988 in a 
major shakeup following a series of military defeats in the closing 
stages of the war he replaced mohsen rafiqdoust rafsanjanis 
brotherinlaw 
shamkani lost that position in august when irans new president 
hashemi rafsanjani announced his government and appointed akbar 
torkan as minister of defense and armed forces logistics 
torkan is a close rafsanjani aide and formerly headed of the 
defense industries organization that built up irans military 
industry during the war 
the revolutionary guards and the regular army air force and 
navy remain separate entities despite earlier moves to merge them 
khamenei opposes such a merger while rafsanjani has tried to 
eliminate the parallel chains of command that hampered military 
operations during the war 
rafsanjani was named acting commanderinchief in june 1988 by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to upgrade irans battered forces he 
relinquished the post in august following his election khamenei 
who succeeded khomeini took over 
political and military rivalry between the regular forces and 
the guards corps were heightened by lack of coordination between 
the two forces these were significant factors in irans 
battlefield defeats in early 1988 that led to tehran 
unconditionally accepting the un security councils ceasefire 
resolution 
it was not clear whether the military shakeup was linked to 
political feuding between rafsanjani leader of irans socalled 
pragmatists and revolutionary radicals led by former interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
western analysts believe that although rafsanjani has emerged as 
the most powerful political figure in iran he faces potential 
challenges from the radicals 
they oppose his moves to restore relations with the west to end 
irans isolation following khomeinis death june 3

parliament passed a bill tuesday allowing 
iran to arrest any american anywhere who offends it and fanatics 
of the revolutionary guards whipped up fervor about the seizure of 
the us embassy 10 years ago 
iranian militants stormed the embassy nov 4 1979 and held 52 
americans hostage for 444 days 
chief justice ayatollah mohammad yazdi said the bill approved by 
150 members of the 270seat parliament responded to the bullying 
nature of the united states 
he referred specifically to a justice department ruling that 
us government agents could pursue and apprehend terrorists in 
other countries which he called the worst kind of terrorism and 
kidnapping 
the bill must be approved by the council of guardians 12 
religious leaders and exports on islamic law who decide 
constitutional questions 
according to the islamic republic news agency irans agents 
could seek and arrest any americans who committed any action 
against iranian citizens or territories and bring them to iran for 
trial under islamic law 
it said the authority would apply to countries that gave the 
right of arrest to us law enforcement agencies and would continue 
while the us enjoys the right to commit such irresponsible 
acts 
the law aims at preserving the prestige and territorial 
integrity of the islamic republic safeguarding the lives and 
properties of iranian nationals abroad and defending the interests 
of the islamic republic irna reported 
us laws enacted in 1984 and 1986 gave american authorities 
jurisdiction to prosecute acts of terrorism involving us citizens 
overseas but not the power of arrest abroad without the permission 
of foreign governments 
in june the us justice department authorized the fbi to 
arrest people wanted by us courts without permission of the 
foreign government details of the authorization were made public 
this month 
secretary of state james a baker iii was said to be disturbed 
by the ruling on grounds it could harm relations with other 
countries 
a statement tuesday from the revolutionary guards corps said 
tens of thousands of its members would lead demonstrators saturday 
outside the former us embassy to mark this great day when 
militants overran it 
the guards who swore personal loyalty to revolutionary 
patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini until he died in june urged 
all iranians to join the demonstration and chant death to 
america 
it said the purpose was humiliation of the great satan the 
criminal america and us flags should be burned 
on sunday the official news agency said nov 4 had been named 
day of struggle against global arrogance the great satan and 
global arrogance are favorite iranian names for the united states 
organizations representing students radical clerics and other 
groups appealed for mass demonstrations 
until sunday president hashemi rafsanjanis government appeared 
to be seeking a lowkey approach to the anniversary 
rafsanjani who leads the socalled pragmatists in iran was 
elected president july 28 he has sought to end irans political 
isolation and improve ties with the west but antiwestern radicals 
oppose him

the treasury department proposed on tuesday 
ways to track the billions of dollars in illegal drug trafficking 
profits that escape official notice through international wire 
transfers of funds 
worldwide gross drug revenues are estimated to be 300 
billion the department said in publishing its proposals in the 
federal register illegal drug revenues in the united states are 
estimated to total 110 billion 
the treasury proposals generally would require more complete 
recordkeeping of international payments and reporting of large 
transfers of credit between domestic and foreign financial 
institutions 
currently banks are required to report cash deposits or 
withdrawals of 10000 or more but officials say this leaves a 
loophole because it does not include wire transfers 
to track the movement of drug profits the treasury is proposing 
that financial institutions keep detailed records of the originator 
and recipient of any international wire transfer 
it also would require banks and other institutions to use know 
your customer procedures to verify the legitimate nature of the 
customers business 
another proposal under consideration would require that 
financial institutions develop a suspicious international wire 
transfer profile and report suspicious payments to treasury 
the department emphasized that the proposals published tuesday 
are not meant to be exclusive and said it is open to other 
suggestions interested parties have 60 days to comment on the 
proposals after which the department will offer specific 
regulations for another 60day comment period

high above the atlantic ocean president bush 
last july composed the letter to president mikhail s gorbachev 
that would result in the first atsea superpower summit in nearly 
half a century 
with his visit to fastchanging poland and hungary fresh in his 
mind bush wrote the invitation july 18 aboard air force one as he 
flew home from europe after a sevennation economic summit in paris 
his journey to the east bloc nations and talks with us allies 
in paris persuaded him that his first meeting as president with 
the soviet leader should be an informal one without much 
fanfare bush said in announcing the summit meeting tuesday 
unveiling what had been the administrations bestkept foreign 
policy secret bush announced that he and gorbachev would meet dec 
2 and 3 aboard us and soviet naval vessels in the mediterranean 
the meeting with many logistics still to be worked out would 
be the first highseas summit since president franklin d roosevelt 
met with british prime minister winston churchill on a battleship 
in the north atlantic in 1941 to discuss the war in europe 
bush who has been accused by some of dragging his feet on 
holding a meeting with gorbachev repeatedly said at a news 
conference that he had been the one to initiate the meeting and 
that he had done so in july 
i didnt want to in this time of dynamic change in eastern 
europe miss something something that i might get better 
firsthand from mr gorbachev he said 
a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity provided some of the details of the genesis of 
decembers meeting 
nearly every leader bush met with in both poland and hungary 
from polish solidarity leader lech walesa to government officials 
urged bush to be supportive of gorbachevs efforts to reform 
his own country and to release some of the bonds on their 
countries the official said 
so out of that the presidents thinking was that that would 
be the kind of thing that he would like to do in private 
discussions but without having to worry about the pressures and 
burdens of arms control agreements and the more formal agenda 
items the official said 
bush took pains to say there is no set agenda of issues to be 
discussed but the official said clearly hell have a set of 
specific ideas 
when bush met with major us allies during the economic summit 
many of those leaders also called on him to meet with gorbachev 
the sooner the better the official said 
bush was exploring a way to have a meeting with the general 
secretary but which would be something short of the traditional 
summit the official said 
in a meeting with top staff aides on the veranda of the us 
ambassadors residence in paris bush advanced the idea of a 
nonsummit summit the official said 
gorbachev responded to bushs letter in early august accepting 
the idea and touching off a flurry of cables between moscow and 
washington as details slowly began to take shape 
there was one problem however specifics still hadnt been 
nailed down on the next formal summit which by custom would be 
held in the united states 
we wanted to get the larger summit set before we finalized 
this one the official said 
finally when secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met in wyoming in september to 
cement plans for a formal summit next year that opened the way to 
plan details for the midocean summit the official said 
a decision was made to hold the meeting on two ships in the 
mediterranean because they wanted it informal isolated and to 
promote the concept of neutrality the official said

a id just refer him to what weve decided is going to be the 
matrix of the meeting 
q so basically you would try to put it off until 
a well i dont i dont attempt i dont expect other than a 
very broad way this these questions to arise because we have a 
summit set to address ourselves to those yeah 
q daniel ortega was supposed to decide today whether to end the 
ceasefire if he does in fact end the ceasefire are you prepared 
with some sort of response 
a well as i said down there im not going to go into that 
hypothetical situation at this time but ill tell you ive never 
seen a meeting where all the participants were so united against 
the outrages of one i mean and were still getting messages in 
about the outrageous performance of daniel ortega reached a new 
embarrasing proportions stepping on it 
q is renewed military aid to the contras though still a viable 
option now is that something you could consider if needed 
a well i am not as i indicated down there i would 
reevaluate the situation in a minute if this ceasefire is broken 
yeah 
q mr president were you upset at all by secretary of state 
bakers inaudible soviet policy inaudible 
a ive discussed this matter with mr baker and mr gates and 
mr scowcroft even discussed it with marlin fitzwater laughter 
dont say i dont reach out laughter and john and you 
know these stories whos up whos down whos winning whos 
not whos going to be a hardline weve got a good strong team 
coping with these problems and you the degree in which bob gates 
and the secretary of state are together and brent and john sununu 
why its weve been very lucky and so i dont get all 
exercised about that kind of thing i know everybody else does 
around here but i dont its just 
q he acknowledged that he stopped gates 
a well i 
q from giving a hardline speech 
a it wasnt a hardline speech and he didnt say that and 
maybe now well understand a little more of whats happening out 
there as a result of what im talking to you today about right 
there 
q on a related question vice president quayle has taken a very 
hardline position and that doesnt is he out of sync 
a no hes totally in sync and i had a chance to discuss this 
with one of the outstanding reporters for the new york times the 
other day who had a feeling he was out of sync and he isnt 
and i just you know everybodys looking for nuances and thats 
fine thats your business but i think weve been blessed in this 
administration by the president can sit in by this the 
president can sit in there and get conflicting ideas and then we 
dont have to go out and sound like theres disarray so when some 
see one statement that may sound a little different then i can 
understand running with that ball because i know how this place 
works but thats the main thing is i feel that we are together 
on these issues and that goes for the vice president and the 
secretary of state and my very able national security team so i 
dont sense this you know one being tugged one way or tugged 
another huh 
q mr president 
a helen you had three questions get at it laughter 
q inaudible 
a i hadnt thought about that 
q mr president on the environment another summit you have 
people 
a that will come up with mr gorbachev 
q well so i thought you have people 
a i think 
q going to the netherlands next week who some say are 
inaudible to go without an agenda it looks like the united 
states is not going to play a leadership role on global warming 
though you promised that during your campaign 
a we will play a leadership role in global warming and itll 
be based on the finest most uptodate science possible and we 
will fulfill that role and i think most countries in spite of 
where they are on some conference look to the united states for 
that kind of leadership in science and we will we will fulfill 
it so and you see both our national our science adviser and 
the head of the epa in sync going over there i think thats 
good saul 
q he already had one 
a he had one before 
reporters yeah 
a i derecognize him ok back here laughter 
q mr president 
q youre at a near conflict with congress on capital gains 
what are you prepared to do about that and will you accept a full 
year of sequestration in lieu of that

abortion foe randall terry has spent the first 
four weeks of his twoyear sentence behind bars and out of the 
limelight but his critics still accuse him of using his jail time 
as a publicity ploy 
terry the outspoken leader of operation rescue is serving time 
for leading a wave of demonstrations outside womens clinics in 
atlanta during the democratic national convention last year 
the 30yearold bornagain christian and former car salesman has 
been jailed 34 times previously for his protests the longest time 
for about a month in 1987 unlike other jail terms terry hasnt 
been allowed to do jailhouse interviews this time and is limited to 
one 10minute phone call a week 
we dont get the access that we had before said barbara 
magera spokeswoman at operation rescues headquarters in 
binghamton ny we just got a little note from him just 
encouraging us and telling us he is doing well that was all that 
we heard from him 
operation rescue is a looseknit grassroots organization founded 
by terry in november 1987 three years after he and his wife 
cindy began standing outside a clinic in binghamton trying to 
discourage women from having abortions it has a mailing list of 
about 20000 people ms magera claims 35000 supporters have been 
jailed for protests 
terry was moved last week to the alpharetta correction and 
rehabilitation center north of atlanta he had been held in the 
fulton county jail since oct 5 
al pierce warden in charge of the mediumsecurity facility 
said terry is being treated like any other inmate he lives in a 
dormitory and has been assigned a job pierce said although he 
didnt know what the job was ms magera said she had been told 
terry worked on a crew installing water pipes 
as far as i know hes adjusting quite well if he wasnt i 
would have heard about it pierce said 
terry was given a 24month sentence oct 5 for his criminal 
trespass and unlawful assembly convictions over protests at an 
atlanta womens clinic july 19 1988 fulton county state court 
judge john bruner said he would suspend the sentence if terry would 
pay two 500 fines stay out of the fivecounty metropolitan 
atlanta area for the 24 months and agree not to break any more 
georgia laws 
terry refused and also refused to pay a 2000 bond that would 
have kept him out of jail while operation rescue appeals his 
sentence he said the amount was too high 
no date has been set for the appeal terry has said he would 
serve the full two years if need be the activist could go free 
any time he decided to meet the requirements and pay the 1000 
fine 
true to form he has taken a mediagrabbing tack of going to 
jail rather than paying the fine we would be surprised if his 
melodramatic posturing as an ideological martyr keeps him in jail 
for more than a few days patricia ireland executive vice 
president of the national organization for women said at the time 
of the sentencing 
however sally tyler executive director of the georgia abortion 
rights action league said recently that abortion supporters are 
really not surprised that terry has remained in jail this long 
i do think hes there because he wants to be and is working 
for an angle in that way she said hes not getting as much 
media while in jail as he had hoped for 
terry counts the rev martin luther king jr as one of his 
heroes but civil rights leaders object to his comparing operation 
rescue to their movement 
atlanta mayor andrew young a former aide to king said terry 
had hoped the state would simply drop its charges against him as 
the city did 
he was arrested blocking and interfering with people who were 
pursuing their health care and we never did that he was trying to 
deny peoples legitimate rights rights that are protected by the 
constitution and we never did that young said 
ms magera responds that kind of criticism is invalid he is 
a prisoner of conscience because he chose not to pay the fine and 
agree to the banishment 
when arrested in atlanta for antiabortion demonstrations in 
july 1988 operation rescue protesters clogged city jails some for 
as long as 40 days by identifying themselves only as baby jane doe 
or baby john doe to express solidarity with aborted fetuses 
some complained about police treatment the length of their jail 
stays and about not being able to see their families 
the rev joseph lowery president of the southern christian 
leadership conference said that behavior contrasts with civil 
rights activists passive resistance 
in civil disobedience you willingly accept the penalty 
lowery said so if jail is the penalty for your offense then you 
accept it as the price you pay for supporting your cause

street attacks on women by bands of teenage 
girls using needles or other sharp objects appear racially 
motivated a police commander said tuesday 
all but one of 28 women jabbed between oct 21 and oct 27 along 
a mile stretch of the citys diverse upper west side were white 
all were attacked between the hours of 630 pm and 830 pm and 
none was seriously hurt 
the victims are selected it appears that theyre selected on 
the fact that theyre white said police capt maurice collins 
commander of the bias incident investigation squad which is 
investigating 
the attackers were described as black females between the ages 
of 12 and 19 no arrests had been made and the city plans to post a 
10000 reward for information leading to a conviction 
each of the victims was jabbed once either in the upper or 
lower back in an arm or on the side of the face they range in age 
from 14 to 50 but most were in their 20s and early 30s police 
said 
most of the victims were walking alone on a street and were 
approached usually from behind they felt a pricking as the black 
female teenagers passed them they observed laughing and 
giggling collins said 
investigators said they did not know what kind of an object was 
used in the attacks 
it could be any kind of a sharp object it could be a needle 
it could be a brooch pin it could be a compass point something 
thats sharp enough to prick the skin the wounds are basically 
shallow collins said 
the thought that the weapon could be a hypodermic needle 
heightened concerns that the victims could be infected with 
diseases such as aids or hepatitis 
i would doubt if it was a hypo needle collins said these 
are very quick jabs for somebody to be injecting anybody with a 
hypo needle would take time 
during most of the attacks no remarks were passed however in 
one of the assaults a teenager cursed her victim and in another 
case a teenager was heard to say were going to cut your hair 
off collins said

rep lynn martin rill a banshee 
no said rep pat roberts rkan who said he was misquoted in 
the record of last weeks debate over a federal project at the 
university of kansas 
on the house floor tuesday roberts said he called mrs martin 
bambi the young deer featured in a walt disney movie not 
banshee 
last thursday mrs martin criticized lawmakers who had inserted 
a few pet projects into a spending bill 
roberts later stepped to the microphone and said mrs martin 
has approached this issue like a virtual banshee in a dark 
forest according to the congressional record 
in folklore a banshee is a female spirit believed to wail 
outside a house as a warning that a death will occur in the family 
roberts insists he had said bambi and mrs martin backs him up 
the congressional record conceded the error 
during lunch that day mrs martin explained she had told 
roberts that bambi was one of her favorite movies 
roberts is known for his colorful oratory a defender of his 
rural constituents he once remarked that if thenpresident 
reagans plane flew too low over kansas it would get a pitchfork 
in the belly in retaliation for unpopular farm policy

television evangelist jimmy swaggart is no 
charlatan and his ministrys sales of religious merchandise should 
be taxexempt the supreme court was told tuesday 
this ministry is not in the business to make money the 
purpose of all of this is to spread the gospel chicago lawyer 
michael mcconnell told the justices 
now all of us can be cynical and with good purpose 
mcconnell said in alluding to televangelist jim bakkers recent 
criminal conviction but mcconnell said such taxation must be 
prohibited unless we are to say that all religious leaders are 
charlatans 
with religious organizations the requirement of the 
constitution is for the government to keep its hands off he said 
mcconnells comments came after justice john paul stevens 
focusing on the sale of a taperecorded sermon asked how to 
distinguish a commercial sale from a religious activity 
the key question mcconnell responded must be is it to 
spread the word or make a buck 
justice thurgood marshall then asked in an incredulous tone 
about the swaggart ministry they werent interested in a buck 
the people involved draw substantial salaries and those 
salaries stem from the sales of tapes books and other 
merchandise marshall said 
but mcconnell said swaggarts annual salary for the tax years at 
issue in his ministrys dispute with california tax officials never 
exceeded 20000 
the nations highest court is to decide by july whether 
californias sales and use tax imposed on retailers for the 
privilege of selling tangible goods in the state must make an 
exception for religious items sold by religious groups 
california court rulings forced swaggarts ministry to pay the 
state 183000 in back taxes and interest for 1974 through 1981 
mcconnell attacked the tax as a violation of religious freedom 
and due process and an undue interference with interstate commerce 
a religious organization carrying out its religious function 
cannot be the occasion for fundraising by the state mcconnell 
contended 
he said the first amendment which ensures the free exercise 
of religion bars such taxation 
california deputy attorney general richard nielsen argued that 
taxing sales made by swaggarts ministry does not conflict with 
any asserted belief of mr swaggart 
swaggart is using the freeexercise clause as a sword in 
fighting for special treatment nielsen said 
the justices were told that california is the only state 
imposing such taxes on religious organizations but if the tax is 
upheld other states would be free to do the same 
both lawyers were peppered with questions from the bench most 
frequently by stevens and justices antonin scalia and sandra day 
oconnor 
scalia challenged mcconnells assertion that the tax unduly 
interferes with religious affairs if the government may station a 
police officer outside a church on sunday to direct traffic why 
cant the government impose a nondiscriminatory tax he asked 
oconnor asked several questions focusing on how great a burden 
is created by the 6 percent state tax 
for the years at issue mailorder sales from swaggarts base in 
baton rouge la to california consumers totaled 17 million 
sales of merchandise at california crusades totaled 240000 
the case is jimmy swaggart ministries vs board of equalization

voters decide on a governor and the makeup 
of the legislatures lower house nov 7 shaping new jerseys 
political power base in a race similar to one that landed the state 
before the us supreme court in 1983 
the next assembly and the current state senate will redraw the 
states congressional districts in line with the population changes 
found in the 1990 census 
as long as the legislature insists on retaining the power to 
redraw districts its an additional prize to be won by whatever 
party can control the majority said ed mccool chairman of new 
jersey common cause 
the democrats who already have majority status in the senate 
are confident that this election will bring them the assembly and 
the governors office and leave the republicans emptyhanded when 
the districts are drawn 
but if that happens and the democrats are too blatant about 
drawing the lines for partisan advantage they can count on finding 
the map just where it was last time around in court 
new jerseys changes after the 1980 census described by 
congressional quarterly as a fourstar gerrymander were 
overturned by the supreme court in 1983 the high court said the 
districts varied too greatly in population to uphold the equal 
representation principle 
the replacement map still in use today was drawn by a federal 
court and approved by the supreme court in 1984 
assemblyman robert franks a former state gop committee 
chairman says the democrats suspect intentions are demonstrated 
by the senates refusal to pass gopsponsored reform bills that 
have passed a republicancontrolled assembly 
the proposals call for getting redistricting out of the 
legislature and appointing a bipartisan commission to draw the 
lines the way state legislative districts are now devised 
with the current senate in place until 1992 the democrats 
know theyre going to be in power during the congressional 
mapmaking process franks said theyve obviously been hoping 
a democratic assembly and governor would be elected and allow 
them to put partisan politics ahead of public interest 
the plan drawn by the democraticcontrolled legislature and 
signed by democratic gov brendan t byrne hours before he left 
office in 1982 looked more like doodles than a congressional 
district map 
many of the contorted shapes spawned nicknames such as the 
flying duck in northern new jersey and the bunny in the central 
part of the state 
a shape dubbed the fish hook survived the courts rewriting it 
includes a thin ribbon hugging the shore at monmouth county the 
boundary comes so close to the water that a judge once joked that 
the district was contiguous as required by federal law only at 
low tide 
besides getting to slice the pie the legislature this time 
might have one less piece to cut under the complicated process 
that determines a states number of seats new jersey could find 
its delegation shrinking from 14 to 13 
franks says he hasnt given up his fight to enact reforms before 
the next exercise in redistricting but barring unforeseen election 
results nov 7 the democrats are likely to find themselves with an 
opportunity too good to refuse observers say 
i think its safe to assume all legislators by their 
definition would take the opportunity mccool said they would 
call it taking care of their side

president bushs shipboard summit with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev responds to pressure to deal more 
forcefully with upheaval in the communist world it also provides 
an opportunity to support perestroika with more than kind words 
gorbachev reacted positively and no wonder the soviet leader 
also faces political and economic pressures a summit could ease 
there are risks in the unstructured twoday session in the 
mediterranean next month with the disarming and nimble kremlin 
chief but the president insisted tuesday that no agenda was needed 
its a chance to put our feet up and talk bush said of the 
plans for the unexpected meeting with gorbachev dec 2 and 3 aboard 
us and soviet naval vessels 
that freeform approach was reminiscent of the meeting three 
years ago in iceland between ronald reagan and gorbachev the two 
leaders wound up in a breathtaking joust over who would be willing 
to go further toward banishing nuclear weapons all of them and 
the summit collapsed in discord 
even so bush is willing to gamble and there are potential 
political and economic benefits for both leaders 
the soviets would like us trade credits membership in world 
lending institutions and a loosening of security restrictions on 
western technology 
bush who so far has offered only vague best wishes for 
gorbachevs success could respond with a lowering of trade 
barriers that he has made conditional on new emigration legislation 
and further easing of limits on sales of some types of computers 
while risky this summit born in secrecy is an opportunity for 
bush to cope with an image that has dogged him over more than a 
quartercentury in politics that he is reluctant to assume command 
timid is the word his critics use wimp was the crueler 
term that surfaced in the presidential campaign 
on foreign policy fronts bush has been unable to talk gen 
manuel antonio noriega out of power in panama and unwilling to 
use force to unseat him and prospects for arabisraeli 
negotiations remain dim 
gorbachev could stand some international event to boost his 
stock as well 
his prodigious perestroika program has not improved the peoples 
lot while several of the nationalities bound together in the 
ussr are straining against the system and threatening to break 
out 
hungarys attachment to the warsaw pact could be weakening 
criticism of gorbachev from more avid reformers like boris yeltsin 
has become commonplace 
as it turned out bush had broached the initiative in a letter 
to gorbachev in july while insisting all along in public he would 
not be stampeded into a unprepared summit meeting 
in his best laidback style bush had said there will 
obviously at some point be a meeting but i still feel id like 
the meeting to be seen as productive rather than just the meeting 
itself 
these reservations have been quietly cast aside by both leaders 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze were instructed to set up the meeting even 
as they worked on a more formal superpower summit to be held in 
late spring or early summer that one will be focused on arms 
control 
amid all the secret diplomacy withheld from most state 
department officials senate democratic leader george j mitchell 
of maine was accusing the administration of not engaging gorbachev 
of failing to encourage change in eastern europe 
the nato allies led by west germany quietly have urged the 
administration to be more responsive to gorbachevs initiatives in 
order to reduce tensions in western europe perestroika is also 
good for business and the west europeans and japan are way ahead 
of the united states in pursuing business deals in the east 
bush finally responded while announcing the mediterranean 
session in this time of change he said i dont want to 
have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed 
communications 
that is what mitchell had feared was happening as bush responded 
last summer to revolutionary change in poland and hungary with a 
modest and since improved aid package and expressing of 
goodwishes to gorbachev on perestroika 
what we have demanded for over four decades is beginning to 
occur mitchell said in a senate speech sept 18 this is 
unquestionably a triumph for the united states now is the time for 
the united states to encourage and capitalize upon the changes we 
have sought for so long 
but doubts were raised within the bush administration 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger cautioned in a 
georgetown university speech on sept 15 that gorbachev was no 
anticommunist he intends to make the soviet union as strong as 
he possibly can eagleburger said 
vice president dan quayle and defense secretary dick cheney were 
other outspoken administration skeptics robert m gates the 
presidents deputy national security assistant was ready last week 
to offer another pessimistic appraisal until secretary of state 
james a baker iii quashed the speech 
by then baker had made a landmark address to the private 
foreign policy association in new york on oct 16 saying the 
administration was prepared to provide moscow with advice and 
technical assistance 
that speech by the presidents close friend and political and 
foreign policy adviser marked the fact the debate within the 
administration essentially was over 
the shipboard meeting may answer the next question of how far 
the president is willing to go to assist the nation that has been a 
cold war adversary for more than a generation

the head of the drug enforcement 
administration on tuesday praised mexican president carlos salinas 
de gortari for revitalizing his governments efforts to curb 
crossborder drug smuggling 
john c lawn said mexico has hired more people for the antidrug 
effort and expanded the countrys aerial crop eradication 
capabilities since salinas took office 11 months ago 
he also noted that a number of suspected mexican drug barons 
have been arrested this year 
weve seen a substantial change in law enforcement efforts 
lawn said antidrug efforts are a major priority in mexico 
lawn took part in a panel discussion on the narcotics issue at 
the heritage foundation a conservative research group 
javier trevino a ministercounselor at the mexican embassy 
said that a 23ton seizure of cocaine by mexican authorities 
several months ago meant that 373 million doses of the drug never 
reached us markets 
former attorney general edwin meese iii stressed the need for a 
continuing effort to reduce drug demand in the united states he 
said surveys indicate the number of narcotics users in the country 
dropped by 30 per cent between 1985 and 1988 
meese cautioned however that despite dramatic drug seizures by 
authorities in the united states and mexico there is a drug 
glut in us markets this has resulted in declining prices for 
high potency drugs 
meese also criticized those who persistently find fault with 
mexicos record on drug enforcement he said this constant 
mexicobashing must stop calling it demeaning ineffective and 
counterproductive 
meese mentioned no names but the most prominent critic of mexico 
on capitol hill is sen jesse helms rnc who maintains that the 
countrys law enforcement effort is riddled with corruption

pay increase and the government responded by ordering schools 
closed for a week 
it is the first major confrontation between labor and president 
jaime paz zamora who took office aug 6 the bolivian workers 
central organized the march to back the teachers and oppose 
government austerity measures 
education takes 18 percent of the bolivian budget and average 
pay for teachers is equivalent to 76 a month they demanded a 15 
percent salary increase and bonuses equal to a months pay 
teachers in this landlocked country in the midsection of south 
america asked for a raise of 330 percent initially but backed down 
after the government said there would be no pay increase this year 
the government says paying teachers more would spur inflation 
and it does not have the resources for either a bonus or a raise 
about 200 teachers and leaders of their union started the hunger 
strike last week to press pay demands thousands of students 
supported them with a demonstration monday but police dispersed it 
with tear gas after some protesters threw rocks at the education

pollution is clogging onefourth of the lakes 
examined in the latest government survey and more will soon meet a 
similar fate if pollution trends continue according to the 
environmental protection agency 
the epas latest survey of lake water quality covering lakes in 
32 states shows that serious pollution problems have impaired more 
3 million of the 12 million acres of lake area examined another 20 
percent of the acres of water examined soon will be threatened with 
impairment 
according to the epa water is considered impaired if it no 
longer can be used for its intended purpose such as swimming or 
fishing in some cases because of pollution 
the epa said that in 76 percent of the cases lake pollution was 
caused by agricultural or urban runoffs while in 11 percent of the 
cases the pollution was attributed to industrial or sewage 
releases in the remaining cases the culprit was naturally caused 
pollution 
the most significant cause of lake impairment was reported to be 
excessive plant and algae growth as a result of the release into 
the waters of high levels of nutrients often those releases came 
from sewage facilities or agricultural runoffs the study said 
the unwanted plant and algae growth often impedes recreational 
activity and reduces a lakes scenic value more importantly it 
also depletes the lake of necessary oxygen choking off fish and 
other parts of the lakes ecosystem said erik olson an attorney 
with the national wildlife federation 
olson said that while the epa findings were a matter of concern 
they understated the true problem with water pollution nationwide 
because not all pollutants that affect water quality are included 
if you consider all the pollutants that have potentially 
devastating effects on fish and wildlife perhaps on people as 
well the number of impaired lake acres would be significantly 
higher he said 
epa officials acknowledged that the degree of lake pollution has 
been difficult to document nationally because of shortcomings in 
data collection 
for example the latest report on lake quality which was 
required for submission to congress did not include data from 16 
states because they did not report it also did not include data 
from the great lakes the countrys biggest lake system that has 
had major pollution problems 
about onefourth of the pollution was attributed to excessive 
nutrients or other sources of organic enrichment being put into the 
water often from sewage or agricultural runoffs 
other causes of damage are high levels of sediment from rocks 
and soil being deposited into lakes warm water discharges that 
disturb fish habitat and the release of pesticides and other 
toxics according to the report 15 percent of the pollution 
problem on the lakes examined was attributed to metals and 
inorganics and another 3 percent to pesticides 
the study reflected lake water quality studies in 32 states 
puerto rico and the district of columbia where more than 18 million 
lake acres were reported of these 124 million acres were 
actually assessed and 45 percent were determined to be either 
impaired or threatened with impairment 
the study did not include any of the great lakes although 
several of the states that border those lakes were among the states 
included in the report

investigators have concluded that sheets of the 
explosive penthrite packed in a suitcase were used to blow up a 
parisbound flight over a niger desert on sept 19 the newspaper 
le figaro reported tuesday 
le figaro without citing sources said the discovery enabled 
authorities to link the attack to the palestinian group arab 
organization of may 15 
it said a similar bomb was used on feb 23 1985 in an attack 
on the marks amp spencer department store in paris that killed one 
person and wounded 14 and that the may 15 group was believed 
responsible for that attack 
the airliner bombing killed all 171 people aboard the french 
airline uta flight 772 from brazzaville congo to paris exploded 
over niger about an hour after taking off from ndjamena chad 
following a stopover there 
le figaro said investigators were able to determine that the 
suitcase bomb was placed in the baggage container loaded onto the 
plane at brazzaville 
previous french news reports said traces of penthrite were found 
in the wreckage 
on tuesday the transport ministry issued a preliminary report 
of the joint franceniger commission of inquiry into the crash 
saying an explosion must have caused the disaster it said analysis 
found strong traces of an explosive material in the debris but 
did not specify the explosive or speculate who might have put it on 
board 
the may 15 group named for the date the 1948 arabisraeli war 
began is led by a man whose war name is abu ibrahim it has been 
held responsible for bombings or attempted bombings aboard airlines 
or at airline offices 
le figaro suggested the group was probably acting on behalf of 
the extremist lebanese shiite moslem organization hezbollah which 
was angered by french support for the maronite christian side in 
lebanons civil war

home buyers would be able to obtain 
governmentinsured mortgages for more expensive homes under 
legislation congress sent president bush on tuesday 
on a voice vote and with no debate the house in a matter of 
moments gave final legislative approval to a spending bill that 
included the mortgage provision 
the measure boosts from 101250 to 124875 the cap on 
mortgages that can be insured by the federal housing administration 
in most of the countrys highcost housing markets 
the mortgage bankers association of america estimated that the 
higher cap which will last one year would allow 100000 
additional families to buy homes with fhabacked loans 
when the government insures a home loan the bank issuing that 
loan facing a lower risk can offer lower interest rates and 
downpayments fhabacked loans account for 900000 home purchases 
each year 
opponents of the higher loan cap have argued that with the fha 
having lost 42 billion last year from its various reserve funds 
according to a congressional report now is the wrong time to 
increase the agencys loan activities 
supporters pointed to the greater number of families that would 
benefit from the higher limits and argued that the increased loan 
activity would reap the government about 104 million in fees paid 
by borrowers 
the bill was approved friday by the senate two days after the 
house voted to change it by lowering the total on the loans the fha 
can insure this year from 74 billion to 57 billion the senate 
restored the higher sum and the house accepted that revision 
tuesday and sent the measure to the white house 
the spending bill provides 67 billion for housing veterans 
space and other programs for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the measure includes 
124 billion for nasa including 18 billion for the proposed 
space station 
56 billion for the environmental protection agency including 
15 billion for the superfund hazardous waste cleanup program 
114 billion for veterans health care 
151 billion for housing programs

farmers are lobbying for governmental 
disaster loans and other aid to help recoup earthquake damage that 
could reach as much as 20 million in santa cruz county alone 
there are no lowinterest loans available to help growers 
rebuild and we are working to find out why said steve siri 
president of the santa cruz county farm bureau 
agriculture has been forgotten after the quake siri said 
i know a lot of growers who are on their knees right now you can 
see their suffering in their faces 
early damage estimates by the university of california extension 
service placed countywide agricultural damage at at least 98 
million agricultural officials in the surrounding couties of santa 
clara monterey and san benito said they did not have estimates on 
agricultural damage but all agreed that santa cruz county was 
hardest hit 
the 98 million figure is expected to more than double said 
siri that early estimate included only about 40 percent of the 
farming business in the county he said 
the estimate included crops lost and structures damaged by the 
oct 17 quake that registered 71 on the richter scale 
agriculture is among the countys top revenue producers 
grossing about 168 million annually siri said the bureau has 
about 1100 members countywide mostly small farmers who work 50 
acres and less 
we probably wont see most of the damage until the spring 
when were able to inspect the pipelines and wells he said 
among those who suffered especially heavy losses was the a 
nagamine nursery in watsonville siri said 
the quake leveled a oneacre greenhouse containing miniature 
pink carnations and an equal number were threatened when they were 
exposed to the cold 
this could be a big loss for us said owner roy nagamine 
these plants would have been ready for valentines day he 
estimated his losses could reach 1 million 
apple growers also were hardhit when the quake shook fruit off 
trees tossed and bruised already picked fruit and damaged 
coldstorage facilities siri said 
with the alar scare they certainly didnt need this he 
said referring to the recent national concern about use of the 
chemical alar on apples siri said although its not used in santa 
cruz county growers suffered when consumers stopped buying apples 
luckily the quake came at the end of the season for lettuce and 
strawberry growers causing those important crops only minimal 
damage he said 
siri said he isnt worried the quake will have a permanent 
effect on labor early reports said many farmworkers had moved back 
to mexico because they had been frightened by the temblor 
we normally have a migration at this time of the year he 
said this may have speeded up the process some growers reported 
they lost some of their workers early this year 
but im confident they will return next season

reviewing the documents early last week said ron harris a 
spokesman for the commission the fivemember commission falls 
under the energy departments responsibilities 
judy demaire executive director of the inspector generals 
office said that as a matter of policy she could neither confirm 
nor deny the existence of an investigation of hesses expenses 
harris said the auditors were supplied with commission documents 
on mrs hesses official travel expenses as well as spending 
related to security precautions taken by the government in response 
to alleged personal threats against mrs hesse 
harris said there had been no allegations of wrongdoing he said 
he did not know what triggered the inspector generals interest in 
mrs hesses official expenses 
everything was approved everything was legal he said 
the inspector generals inquiry was first reported in mondays 
editions of the weekly publication legal times it reported that 
among other personal charges billed to the government by mrs hesse 
was 374 to replace a 535 blouse she ripped while on the job

mrs hesse had taken 11 foreign trips as commission chairman since 
1987 and that so far this year she had made at least 19 trips 
domestically it said the foreign trips cost the government 28000

story he said all the reported trips were ordinary speaking 
engagements that mrs hesse accepted as a spokeswoman for federal 
regulation of us energy and power industries

than her predecessors he said it was just her style to keep a 
heavier schedule of public speaking

for a home security system and 3090 for a cellular phone for mrs 
hesses use it said the equipment was deemed necessary in light of

preapproved costs and that it was understood from the start 
that the equipment would be returned to the government when mrs 
hesse leaves the commission

bill for 4270 in repairs to mrs hesses porsche automobile 
which allegedly was vandalized in the commissions parking garage

president bush announced tuesday he will hold 
a shipboard summit in the mediterranean with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev dec 2 and 3 to put up our feet and talk 
informally prior to a fullblown superpower meeting next year 
bush described the weekend meeting as an openended discussion 
with no fixed agenda he said neither he nor gorbachev anticipate 
that substantial decisions or agreements will emerge on arms 
control or other matters 
the talks will take place on us and soviet naval ships on 
alternate days the precise location was not announced but a site 
off italy appeared likely since gorbachev is to visit there from 
nov 29 to dec 1 
bush acknowledged he originally had opposed the concept of a 
getacquainted session favoring instead a wellplanned meeting 
with assurances of concrete results 
however he decided that with dramatic democratic changes 
sweeping across eastern europe the leaders of the two superpowers 
should deepen our understanding of each other 
i dont want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night 
because of failed communication bush said i just didnt want 
to in this time of dynamic change miss something something 
that i might get better firsthand from mr gorbachev 
the president said he expected a lot of discussion about 
eastern europe 
bushs announcement drew bipartisan applause on capitol hill 
although senate democratic leader george mitchell said he was not 
about to rescind his criticism that the presidents policies toward 
the blossoming of democracy in eastern europe have been too 
timid 
sen alan simpson rwyo the gops deputy leader said that 
kind of stuff about being too timid or too cautious bounces off 
george bush like a 22rifle bullet off a tank 
the summit was jointly announced in washington and in moscow 
where soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said the talks 
between the two leaders were aimed at allowing them to know each 
other better and would contribute to broadening the changes 
taking place in the sovietamerican relationship 
much of the planning appeared still to be done 
white house chief of staff john sununu asked what country bush 
would use as the staging area for the talks said we dont know 
yet however sources suggested that naples italy a major 
seaport was the most likely area 
the sources insisting on anonymity also said the most likely 
us ship for the talks was the cruiser belknap the 547foot long 
missilearmed flagship of the sixth fleet based in the 
mediterranean there was speculation bush would make the ship his 
headquarters and spend the night there 
officials said they did not know if first ladies barbara bush 
and raisa gorbachev would accompany their husbands 
bush said he decided to meet on a ship so we can do it without 
too much fanfare where theres a relatively few number of 
people not a lot of crush of bodies out there and a chance to put 
our feet up and talk i think its easy logistically for both 
sides 
it will not be the first shipboard summit 
in august 1941 five months before the united states entered 
world war ii president franklin d roosevelt met with british 
prime minister winston churchill aboard a battleship off 
newfoundland canada and proclaimed an atlantic charter providing 
for freedom of the seas and leading to the arming of merchant ships 
it will be bushs first meeting as president with gorbachev 
although he participated in talks in washington and new york with 
the soviet leader while serving as ronald reagans vice president 
bush and gorbachev have agreed to meet in late spring or early 
summer to deal with major issues and bush said tuesday he still 
hopes to be able to sign a treaty then to reduce strategic nuclear 
weapons 
the december meeting gives bush a defense against democratic 
charges that he has been slow to respond to initiatives from 
gorbachev and to the striking changes under way in the soviet union 
and elsewhere in eastern europe gorbachev meanwhile is under 
pressure to demonstrate that his program of economic restructuring 
can improve the lives of ordinary soviet citizens 
asked if the meeting would give gorbachev a boost at home bush 
said i hadnt particularly thought about that if it does 
fine 
and would it help bush thats not why were doing it but if 
that should be the fallout so be it he replied 
bush and other white house officials said the meeting had been 
secretly in the works since the president returning from a trip to 
poland and hungary and the sevennation economic summit in paris 
wrote a letter to gorbachev on air force one july 18 on the flight 
back to washington 
bush was moved to action by appeals he heard during the trip 
from leaders in poland and hungary a senior administration 
official said 
they were urging him to be supportive of general secretary 
gorbachev and his efforts to reform his own country and in his 
efforts to release some of the bonds on their countries said the 
official speaking only on condition of anonymity 
the official said gorbachev responded affirmatively to the 
invitation in early august and planning got seriously under way 
however officials did not want to announce an informal meeting 
until an agreement had been reached for a more substantive meeting 
next year he said

president bush said tuesday he will review 
us policy toward nicaragua including the possibility of renewing 
military aid to the contra rebels if president daniel ortega calls 
off the ceasefire that has been in place for 19 months 
at a news conference bush also escalated his criticism of 
ortega for suggesting at the hemispheric summit conference last 
weekend in costa rica that he might respond to contra military 
attacks by suspending the march 1988 truce 
ive never seen a meeting where all the participants were so 
unanimously against all the outrages of one and were still 
getting messages in here about the outrageous performance of daniel 
ortega he said 
asked whether he might consider asking congress for a resumption 
of military aid to the contras if ortega calls off the truce bush 
said i would reevaluate this situation in a minute if the 
ceasefire is broken 
congress suspended military aid to the contras a few weeks 
before the ceasefire agreement was reached in early 1988 bush has 
abandoned use of the military option against the sandinistas 
preferring instead economic and diplomatic pressure to try to 
promote a democratic outcome there 
ortega was to announce a final decision tuesday on whether to 
suspend the ceasefire 
bush spoke a day after secretary of state james a baker iii 
said threats by ortega to call off the truce may be a prelude to 
cancellation of national elections set for february in nicaragua 
but ortega has said the elections will take place war or no war 
the administrations belief that ortega may be in trouble 
politically at home is based partly on a recent poll taken by the 
costa rican affiliate of gallup international showing that ortega 
trails opposition candidate violeta chamorro by 40 percent to 29 
percent 
but some analysts regard such polling as not necessarily 
reliable because of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate 
sampling in a country consisting largely of a peasant population 
ortega contends the contras have systematically violated the 
ceasefire leading to the deaths of more than 730 sandinista 
soldiers since it went into effect 
but a senior state department official who briefed reporters on 
monday insisting on anonymity said the sandinista army has 
conducted aggressive and continuing searchanddestroy operations 
against resistance forces since the truce began 
from may through september 1989 at least 105 rebels have been 
killed in such operations he said adding that the contra 
casualties run about 15 to 20 a month since the truce went into 
effect 
the bulk of the contras are stationed at camps in honduras but 
up to 3000 remain inside nicaragua

filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash but claims 
against the maker of the jetliner are being pursued a federal 
judge said tuesday 
northwest and mcdonnell douglas corp which made the md80 
aircraft also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the 
crash near detroit metropolitan airport 
terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against 
northwest were not disclosed 
a total of 157 lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims 
eleven were settled earlier and one filed on behalf of a 5month 
fetus was dismissed 
us district judge julian a cook jr announced the settlements 
as the jury trial was to begin tuesday he reset opening arguments 
for wednesday 
attorneys and family members and friends of the victims would 
not comment on the settlement abiding by a gag rule cook imposed 
the jury will resolve the claims against mcdonnell douglas 
northwests claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash 
and mcdonnell douglas claim that the plane was improperly flown 
flight 255 crashed aug 16 1987 on takeoff from detroit for 
phoenix 
the national transportation safety board ruled that flight 255s 
pilots failed to set the planes wing flaps and slats properly for 
takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would 
have detected the error 
also a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the 
flaps and slats were not set for takeoff the ntsb said 
the only passenger who survived the crash was cecelia cichan 
then 4 of tempe ariz whose parents and brother died in the 
crash she now lives with relatives in alabama

announced 
of the six jurors and six alternates half had seen newspaper 
headlines or heard broadcast reports indicating the case was 
settled and three more had been told by friends it was over they 
told cook 
cook questioned jurors individually about the reports asking if 
they understood that plaintiffs could resolve claims against one 
defendant and still pursue claims against another 
i am satisfied that all of them can be and will be 
impartial he said 
the jury is expected to hear up to six months of testimony in 
determining liability in the northwestmcdonnell douglas cross 
claims they also will decide if and to what degree mcdonnell 
douglas was to blame for the crash money damages would be 
determined in later trials

some colombian drug traffickers have tried to 
buy large shipments of guns in the united states but most us 
weapons winding up in their hands were bought individually or in 
small batches federal firearms officials told a congressional 
panel tuesday 
we know firearms are being purchased in the united states 
for the colombian cocaine cartels phil a orsini of the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms told the house foreign affairs 
committees task force on international narcotics control 
what we cannot determine is what percentage of the firearms 
used by the cartels are from a us source said orsini who 
heads the atfs firearms enforcement branch 
information from traces of guns seized in colombia indicate that 
drug traffickers have attempted to buy large numbers of guns from 
undercover agents but far more are trickling out a few at a 
time he said 
noting that there are 270000 licensed gun dealers in the united 
states orsini said the dealers inadvertently contribute 
greatly to the drug traffickers armaments primarily through 
small legal sales to individuals who then smuggle the weapons to 
colombia 
asked by panel chairman lawrence j smith dfla whether us 
gun dealers are involved in conspiracies to provide arms to the 
drug traffickers orsini said it would be naive to think its 
not going on to a certain extent however he said we have not 
seen any indication of widespread collusion 
orsini refused to criticize the legality of individual gun sales 
in the united states prompting guncontrol advocate rep harry 
johnston dfla to say im embarrassed for your organization 
that you gave that answer 
in september colombian president virgilio barco and justice 
minister monica de greiff asked the united states to curb gun 
shipments to drug traffickers who declared total war on the 
government after the crackdown began aug 18 
in the past 10 weeks drug traffickers have been blamed for many 
shootings as well as 237 bombings that killed 33 people and injured 
222 
william p rosenblatt assistant customs commissioner for 
enforcement told the house panel of several seizures of weapons 
heading for colombia 
an investigation in march 1988 in west palm beach fla led to 
the arrest of david candiotti and carlos enrique gil who allegedly 
were negotiating with undercover customs and atf operatives to buy 
for export to colombia 100 pounds of c4 explosives 25 mac11 
machine guns 20 colt ar15 rifles and five fully automatic m60 
machine guns 
during the investigation agents identified two previous 
shipments of munitions including 25 pounds of plastic explosives 
30 ar15 rifles five 50caliber rifles 25 silencers for mac11 
machine pistols two sniper rifles and night vision equipment 
rosenblatt said these items were exported via private aircraft 
and delivered to an individual alleged to be associated with the 
cali colombia cartel a rival to the medellin cocaine cartel 
he said 
customs inspectors at the los angeles international airport on 
april 29 1988 discovered 16 hand grenades four ar15 rifles that 
had been converted to fully automatic operation six bulletproof 
vests and a pair of night vision goggles concealed in a large 
airconditioning unit destined for cali aboard avianca airlines 
atf spokesman jack killorin said monday that customs officials 
during the summer grabbed 37 rifles on an airplane going down to 
barranquilla colombia we were able to run down those guns lock 
up some of the purchasers 
the atf has been helping to trace guns seized in colombia and 
wants to send agents to that country permanently to enhance the 
effort in an interview monday atf director stephen e higgins 
said my understanding is the colombia officials think that is a 
good way to proceed 
of the weapons traced the gun of choice among colombias drug 
traffickers appears to be the colt ar15 semiautomatic 
assaultstyle rifle but many other weapons also have turned up 
according to killorin 
the ar15 was the most popular usmade weapon similar to the 
imported ak47 and uzi carbines that were banned from the united 
states in the spring 
colt industries inc suspended retail sales of the ar15 after 
the bush administration imposed a temporary import suspension on 
the foreignmade semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons in march 
company spokesman mike dunn said that sales to us government 
agencies and law enforcement continue

a michigan law restricting political donations 
by private corporations abridges their freespeech rights and gives 
their foes an unfair advantage a lawyer for the michigan state 
chamber of commerce told the supreme court tuesday 
but michigan solicitor general louis j caruso defended the law 
saying wealthy corporations could dominate the political arena if 
allowed to make direct contributions to candidates 
the chamber of commerce filed suit seeking to have the state law 
declared unconstitutional and the case is likely to have a broad 
nationwide impact on the way campaigns for federal and state 
offices are financed 
the law which carries a 10000 fine generally prohibits 
corporations from spending in behalf of political candidates 
however corporations may establish political action committees 
that funnel voluntary contributions to candidates 
caruso drew a crossfire of sharp questions from justices antonin 
scalia and anthony kennedy challenging his contention that the 
state has a compelling interest in limiting corporate participation 
in politics 
why is there a great risk to the political process from 
expenditures by a family owned corporation but if donald trump 
wants to come in and spend all the money he likes that would be no 
problem scalia asked 
i find it difficult to see what the evil being driven at is 
he said later is the state going to be swept away by ads signed 
by general motors 
caruso said the supreme court historically has given states 
broad authority to regulate corporate political activity 
the fact is that corporations have an unfair advantage in the 
political marketplace he said the chamber of commerce can 
have a serious impact on the political process 
chamber lawyer richard d mclellan argued that both the 
purpose and the activities of the chamber of commerce are 
ideological the chamber he said lobbies for specific 
legislation and ballot initiatives and conducts publiceducation 
campaigns in favor of its positions on the issues 
mclellan said the state law is unfair because it exempts 
unincorporated labor unions the michigan business communitys top 
political adversaries 
the chamber in 1985 wanted to advertise in the grand rapids 
press supporting a republican candidate for the state house of 
representatives fearing the ad would violate the law the chamber 
decided against running it and filed suit 
a federal judge upheld the law ruling that it applied to the 
michigan state chamber of commerce 
but the 6th us circuit court of appeals overturned the 
decision ruling that indirect expenditures by a nontraditional 
corporation formed for essentially ideological purposes do 
not pose the threat or appearance of corruption

president virgilio barco pledged on 
tuesday that drug traffickers will not succeed in forcing the 
government to grant them amnesty through the use of terrorism 
barco declared in a nationally broadcast speech the colombian 
people will not accept reconciliation with those who have shown 
they do not respect the most basic human rights 
he said the drug lords in the last few weeks had tried to gloss 
over a violent terrorist campaign with proposals for peace talks 
with the government 
the government has rejected and will continue rejecting such 
proposals the president said 
barco and gen miguel maza marquez head of the nations 
intelligence force spoke at the headquarters of the department of 
administrative security at ceremonies commemorating the forces 
36th anniversary 
the president said the struggle against traffickers was 
difficult because of the internationalization of their 
activities their complex organization and their enormous 
resources 
maza marquez who survived a may 31 bomb attack that killed 
seven people in this capital said traffickers have declared war on 
the colombian establishment at its highest level but that this 
nation would be victorious in its crusade against drug 
traffickings dark scourge 
leaders of colombis most powerful cocaine cartel based in 
medellin have asked for peace talks five times the past two months 
they offered to lay down their arms end a terrorist bombing 
campaign and abandon the drug business if the government will grant 
them amnesty and stop extraditing traffickers to the united states 
the barco administration extradited five colombians wanted for 
trafficking after beginning its drug crackdown on aug 19 the day 
after sen luis carlos galan was assassinated galan the leading 
presidential candidate was an outspoken foe of the drug traders 
traffickers responded with a renewed campaign of bombings and 
assassinations a judge eight journalists and a leading leftist 
politician were among 34 people killed in a twomonth spasm of 
violence by the drug runners

not including annual operating costs of some 3 billion and leave 
the navy with an aging fleet says a congressional report 
the total price tag is consistent with money appropriated for 
such ships in the past the congressional budget office said in a 
study released this week however a shrinking defense budget and 
competition from submarines and guidedmissile destroyers for funds 
may force the administration to consider other options 
the most realistic choice might be to reduce the goal for 
amphibious lift the cbo said such a reduction in the goal 
would be consistent with the arguments of critics who contend that 
large amphibious assaults are obsolete 
the navy currently operates 63 amphibious ships and meets about 
88 percent of its goal of providing enough ships to transport 
simultaneously 50000 marine corps troops and large numbers of 
vehicles cargo equipment and aircraft 
the navy and the marine corps contend that the fleet needs to be 
increased in response to the cut in the number of us military 
bases overseas an amphibious force can operate independently of 
foreign bases 
the administration therefore plans to buy three different 
types of amphibious vessels from 1990 through 1994 including a 1 
billion assault ship that can carry helicopters and jets 
in addition the administration revised its plans on retiring 
ships after 30 years instead ships would remain in the fleet 
until they reach 35 years 
the total cost for this plan is 45 billion plus about 28 
billion in operating costs over the next 10 years 
the cbo in its study titled moving the marine corps by sea 
in the 1990s proposes three alternatives to the administration 
plan including selectively retiring some older vessels at a 
savings of 12 billion or canceling the purchase of two new ships 
and seven landing craft for 14 billion in savings 
the third option involves forgoing the purchase of all new ships 
five in total and 22 of the 48 landing craft the administration 
has sought the result would be savings of 36 billion in 
procurement money and 600 million in operating costs 
the resulting fleet would meet only between 66 percent and 79 
percent of the administrations goal for amphibious shipping but 
would still meet the needs of any amphibious operation conducted 
since world war ii the cbo said 
the study noted that the administrations current goal for 
amphibious capability is larger than what has been needed in any 
assault since world war ii 
in 1950 the landing at inchon south korea involved about 
19500 marines and a total force of about 25000 troops since 
then none of the major events involving marines has required more 
than 1700 soldiers

us schools must attract more qualified 
teachers and give them incentives to remain if every child is to 
receive a complete education a senate hearing was told tuesday 
teaching today is a profession in crisis sen edward 
kennedy dmass said in setting the stage for the hearing before 
his committee on labor and human resources 
teachers are faced with one of the most important most 
difficult and most thankless jobs in the nation often today in 
addition to their responsibilities as educators teachers must also 
respond to the outside world that students bring into the classroom 
crime in their neighborhoods drugs in their hallways the abuse 
and neglect in their homes 
kennedy and sen claiborne pell dri have introduced two 
bills to enhance teacher recruitment training and professional 
development 
linda darlinghammond professor of education at teachers 
college columbia university told the panel that recent statistics 
place the demand for new teachers at just over 2 million between 
1988 and 1995 while the supply is only about 135000 each year or 
just over 1 million over the same time period 
only about threequarters of those who prepare to teach actually 
enter teaching after graduation and of those who do enter about 
half leave during their first five years 
the reasons for teacher shortages are no mystery said ms 
darlinghammond pointing to a decline in teacher salary by more 
than 15 percent during the 1970s and a widening wage gap that 
already existed between teachers and other college graduates 
recruiting minorities to teach is particularly difficult said 
shirley mcbay dean for student affairs at massachusetts institute 
of technology 
demographic trends she said show that about 22 percent of all 
americans are members of a minority and the best estimates 
indicate that by about 2020 onethird of the us population will 
be american indian asian black or hispanic 
ms mcbay said the american association of colleges for teacher 
education estimates that just 5 percent of the teachers in the 
present workforce are members of a minority and less than 8 percent 
of the students in teachers education programs in 1987 were 
minority 
if the nation is to take seriously its duty to fully educate 
every student nothing short of a declaration of emergency will 
suffice said beverly caffee glenn dean of the howard university 
school of education

president bush said tuesday he will review 
us policy toward nicaragua including the possibility of renewing 
military aid to the contra rebels if president daniel ortega calls 
off the ceasefire that has been in place for 19 months 
at a news conference bush also renewed his criticism of ortega 
for suggesting at the hemispheric summit conference last weekend in 
costa rica that he might respond to contra military attacks by 
suspending the march 1988 truce 
ive never seen a meeting where all the participants were so 
unanimously against all the outrages of one and were still 
getting messages in here about the outrageous performance of daniel 
ortega he said 
asked whether he might consider asking congress for a resumption 
of military aid to the contras if ortega calls off the truce bush 
said i would reevaluate this situation in a minute if the 
ceasefire is broken 
congress suspended military aid to the contras a few weeks 
before the ceasefire agreement was reached in early 1988 bush has 
abandoned use of the military option against the sandinistas 
preferring instead economic and diplomatic pressure to try to 
promote a democratic outcome there 
bush spoke a day after secretary of state james a baker iii 
said threats by ortega to call off the truce may be a prelude to 
cancellation of national elections set for february in nicaragua 
but ortega has said the elections will take place war or no 
war 
the administrations belief that ortega may be in trouble 
politically at home is based partly on a recent poll taken by the 
costa rican affiliate of gallup international showing that ortega 
trails opposition candidate violeta chamorro by 40 per cent to 29 
per cent 
but some analysts regard such polling as not necessarily 
reliable because of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate 
sampling in a country consisting largely of a peasant population 
ortega contends the contras have systematically violated the 
ceasefire leading to the deaths of more than 730 sandinista 
soldiers since it went into effect 
but a senior state department official who briefed reporters on 
monday insisting on anonymity said the sandinista army has 
conducted aggressive and continuing searchanddestroy operations 
against resistance forces since the truce began 
from may through september 1989 at least 105 rebels have been 
killed in such operations he said adding that the contra 
casualties run about 15 to 20 a month since the truce went into 
effect 
the bulk of the contras are stationed at camps in honduras but 
up to 3000 remain inside nicaragua

a top bush administration official tuesday 
denied that there is a serious policy rift between the 
administration and the federal reserve over efforts to push the 
value of the dollar down to improve the countrys trade balance 
but the comments of treasury undersecretary david mulford 
werent totally backed up by later statements from federal reserve 
vice chairman manuel johnson 
in testimony before a house banking subcommittee both men 
sought to minimize differences between the administration and the 
fed 
however johnson left no doubt that the central bank was still 
concerned about fighting inflationary pressures in the us economy 
and gave that effort a much higher priority than the 
administrations desire to see the dollar stabilized at a lower 
value in order to boost us exports 
president bush and other administration officials have made 
various comments that they believed the fed was overly concerned 
about inflation and should be doing more to lower interest rates to 
boost the us economy 
lower interest rates not only stimulate domestic demand but also 
serve to push the dollars value lower because foreign investors do 
not earn as much on their us investments when us interest rates 
fall these lower earnings serve to divert investments to other 
countries where returns are relatively better thus driving up 
those currencies against the dollar 
a lower dollar may help us exports by making american products 
cheaper in terms of other currencies and thus more competitive 
overseas by the same token us imports become more expensive 
the fedadministration debate was brought to a head following a 
sept 23 announcment by the group of seven industrial nations that 
they planned to cooperate jointly on the dollar and interest rate 
policies in an effort to curb the dollars rise this year 
however while interest rates were increased by both japan and 
west germany the federal reserve has not changed its interestrate 
policies even though the administration has been lobbying for such 
a change 
mulford told the committee that he believed news reports of a 
dispute between the fed and the administration had been 
substantially overstated 
the consultations between the treasury and the fed has been 
close and friendly he said in response to questions about the 
policy dispute 
while the banking panel had originally sought to have both 
mulford and johnson testify and answer questions at the same time 
johnson waited to testify until mulford had finished his twohour 
appearance and left the room 
in his testimomy johnson left no doubt that the central bank 
still viewed fighting inflation as its no 1 priority he indicated 
that efforts to push the dollar lower as a way of curing the 
countrys trade problems were doomed to failure as long as more 
basic problems such as the huge us budget deficit and americas 
low savings rate were not addressed 
there is little room for substantial further reduction in us 
trade deficits absent a significant reduction of the 
savinginvestment balance he said 
many economists support johnsons view contending that the 
countrys trade problem is primarily caused by the fact that 
american consumers have been on a consumption binge buying more 
than can be produced domestically 
to correct this imbalance the personal savings rate and the 
us budget deficit must both be cut to lower personal and 
government consumption these economists believe 
there appeared to be a substantial split among members of the 
committee over the longterm success of intervention in currency 
markets the process by which governments buy and sell currencies 
on the open market in an attempt to influence their price 
rep jim leach riowa argued that with 400 billion in foreign 
currencies being traded every day any amounts of intervention by 
central governments would have little longterm impact on the 
markets 
mulford agreed with this but he said that joint intervention 
was still a useful exercise to demonstrate the resolve of the 
united states and its major allies to work together in solving 
trade imbalances and other economic problems 
rep john lafalce dny criticized the administration and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady for being too complacent about 
the dollars rise this year he said that unless stronger efforts 
were taken backed by the fed then the countrys trade deficit as 
measured by the current account could well balloon to a record 
200 billion in a few short years 
mulford said that it was possible that the current account 
deficit which declined to 1266 billion last year may worsen 
next year after two years of significant improvement

a republican senator said tuesday that a 
number of liberal organizations are mobilizing to do a job on 
the nomination of clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge 
sen john c danforth rmo told lawmakers that thomas has 
one thing going against him and that is that is is a black lawyer 
of fairly conservative political and judicial philosophy 
i am concerned about what i fear might happen to my friend 
clarence thomas when he comes before the senate judiciary committee 
in his hearings danforth said 
the bush administration on monday nominated thomas as a judge of 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia it 
is considered a prestige post because many of the most heavily 
spotlighted cases come before the court 
also on tuesday thomas received only a qualified rating 
from the american bar associations judicial screening panel 
justice department spokesman david runkel confirmed that the 
abas standing committee on federal judiciary had rated clarence 
thomas qualified instead of well qualified 
runkel downplayed the fact that thomas received a qualified 
instead of a well qualified rating saying that anyone who is 
qualified is by definition an appropriate nominee 
according to the abas judicial screening handbook a 
qualified rating means that the nominee meets minimum 
qualifications for satisfactory performance as a judge 
to be rated well qualified a nominee must have the 
committees strong affirmative endorsementand be regarded as one 
of the best available for the vacancy from the standpoint of 
integrity competence and temperament the handbook said 
thomas 41 has drawn considerable criticism from capitol hill 
during his sevenyear tenure at the equal employment opportuniny 
commission after president bush announced in june his plan to 
nominate thomas 14 house members signed a letter asking him to 
reconsider 
critics say thomas has not been vigorous enough in enforcing 
civil rights laws 
the senator took the floor and said i know him to be an 
absolutely firstrate lawyer and beyond that i know him to be a 
firstrate human being 
the interest groups that did a job on william lucas in the 
senate judiciary committee are going to be mobilizing again to do a 
job on clarence thomas danforth said 
when such organizations wage a campaign danforth said 
anything goes in an effort to destroy the person who is the 
nominee with whom you disagree 
a wide array of liberal and civil rights organizations including 
the national association for the advancement of colored people and 
the naacp legal and educational defense fund opposed the bush 
administrations nomination of former wayne county sheriff william 
lucas a black republican as head of the civil rights division of 
the justice department 
the nomination died in the senate judiciary committee with a 
number of democratic lawmakers saying they did not detect a deep 
enough commitment to civil rights on the part of lucas 
meanwhile a number of civil rights groups that opposed the 
lucas nomination sent a letter to the senate judiciary committee 
asking the lawmakers to withhold judgment until a thorough 
examination is conducted to determine whether mr thomas is 
fit 
the groups included the alliance for justice the national 
association for the advancement of colored people the national 
education association the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees and the mexicanamerican legal defense and 
education fund 
the letter stopped short of recommending defeat of thomas but 
it said that his actions as head of the eeoc suggest that he 
lacks the commitment to equal justice the qualifications and the 
judicial temperment for a lifetime appoint to one of the nations 
most important courts 
ralph neas of the leadership conference on civil rights said 
said many of the umbrella groups member organizations have 
concerns about the thomas record but that the conference has not 
adopted a position thus far

the chairman of the senate banking committee 
named a special panel tuesday to investigate the 
multibilliondollar scandals at the department of housing and urban 
development just as a house probe is winding down 
sen bob graham dfla was named chairman of the new special 
investigations subcommittee by sen donald riegle dmich 
chairman of the banking committee 
graham said no decision had been made on whether the panel would 
seek testimony from former hud secretary samuel pierce who has 
refused to testify before a house investigative panel on 
constitutional grounds of selfincrimination or three of his 
former aides who have also refused to testify 
our goal is to make sure our housing program doesnt get 
sacked again graham said working with our colleagues in the 
house well establish causes for the breakdown at hud and propose 
corrective legislation 
the chairman of the house subcommitee rep tom lantos 
dcalif said last week after pierces second refusal to testify 
that his panel was about to wrap up the hearings it began 
conducting last spring 
graham said said lantos has been very generous in his offer to 
assist us in pursuing the investigation and finding legislative 
remedies for the influence peddling fraud and mismanagement that 
hud secretary jack kemp has acknowledged he found at the department 
graham presided over a hearing by the full banking committee on 
the hud scandal in which a pair of former reagan white house 
officials denied they exerted any influence on behalf of specific 
projects seeking hud grants 
a third witness william m diefenderfer iii deputy director of 
the office of management and budget acknowledged a massive 
failure of collective oversight responsibilities which includes 
omb was responsible for the hud scandals the cost of those 
scandals has been estimated at 2 billion to 6 billion or more 
what we learned today was there was no meaningful oversight of 
hud during the reagan administration graham said later 
the cliche of waste fraud and abuse was just that it was a 
banner with no substance 
appearing before the panel was richard h davis former 
associate director for cabinet affairs at the reagan white house 
and assistant attorney general carol crawford who during the 
reagan administration was associate director for economics and 
governments at omb 
davis who was the white house liason to hud said he talked 
daily with pierces former executive assistant deborah gore dean 
who has cited her fifth amendment rights in refusing to testify 
before congress but davis said he only passed along correspondence 
or calls the white house received from political figures or others 
with no value judgment 
i cant recall an instance where i was advocating a particular 
project with miss dean davis said 
crawford said that while she was a top official of the white 
houses office of management and budget with budget responsibility 
for hud she was not responsible for overseeing management concerns 
she said she was aware of problems however in huds 
moderate rehabilitation program which provided indirect federal 
subsidies sought by developers for renovating housing for the poor 
she said the administration repeatedly recommended ending the 
program but congress disagreed with us and continued to fund it 
also named to the new panel besides graham were republican 
sens connie mack of florida and christopher bond of missouri and 
democratic sens richard c shelby of alabama and richard bryan of 
nevada

parliament decided tuesday to let the 
people decide how and when to elect a president and approved plans 
to scale down a joint danube river dam project despite 
czechoslovakias objections 
a motion to hold the election plebiscite nov 26 was approved by 
a vote of 2947 in the 380seat legislature a proposal fixing jan 
7 for a direct presidential election assuming that is the choice 
was approved 3036 
hungarys ruling communist party before its transformation oct 
7 into a new socialist party agreed with several new opposition 
groups to choose the president by popular vote before parliamentary 
elections planned for next year 
two groups that want the president appointed by the new 
parliament collected more than 200000 signatures on petitions 
supporting that view however and the issue went to the 
legislators 
while they profess democratic ideals the socialists will remain 
in power at least until the parliamentary elections the 
petitioning organizations contended a popular election for 
president would favor the socialists because of their hold on power 
the decision on the danube power project came five months after 
hungary declared a moratorium on construction because of mounting 
costs and fears of environmental damage including pollution of 
budapests drinking water 
czechoslovakia a conservative warsaw pact ally already unhappy 
about hungarys rapid move toward a multiparty democracy was 
angered by the suspension and the vote tuesday was expected to make 
matters worse 
premier miklos nemeth urged parliament to authorize new 
negotiations with czechoslovakia and acknowledged indirectly that 
the project had become a difficult political issue 
he added however can there be a greater political question 
than protection of the human environment the responsiblity to the 
living conditions of future generations 
only 189 members approved renegotiating terms of the 
hydroelectric project but they were a majority because of absences 
and abstentions 
a 1977 agreement with czechoslovakia hungarys northern 
neighbor foresees diverting stretches of the danube and creating a 
huge reservoir east of bratislava capital of slovakia as part of 
a complex straddling the border 
several joint negotiating sessions since the hungarian 
suspension have failed in its latest rejection of hungarian 
efforts to reduce the scope of the 3 billion undertaking 
czechoslovakia sent a diplomatic note monday demanding compensation 
and threatening to divert the river on its own 
hungary contends such a diversion would violate international 
and bilateral agreements governing border rivers and has 
threatened in its turn to seek international arbitration

east germany may legalize the main opposition 
group its official media said and democracy marchers kept up the 
pressure tuesday while egon krenz the new leader was in moscow to 
see reformer mikhail s gorbachev 
the ruling communist party politburo held its weekly meeting 
tuesday adn the official news agency indicated more leadership 
changes might be in store 
several thousand people rallied in weimar 10000 at meissen 
near dresden and 5000 in meiningen near the west german border 
adn reported it said one demand of the marchers was legalization 
of new forum the largest opposition alliance 
both the agency and state televisions evening news said the 
interior ministry was studying an appeal of the ban 
in september the interior ministry turned down new forums 
application for recognition describing it as an antistate 
organization and ordered its members to cease all activity 
it has been tolerated since mass protest began several weeks 
ago however and new forum leaders have met recently with 
communist party officials 
new forum has attracted a wide following with its calls for free 
elections free speech and a free press it claims a membership of 
15000 
krenz who became communist party leader oct 18 has made moves 
toward reform that would have been unthinkable under his hardline 
precessor erich honecker 
he arrived in moscow late tuesday and planned to meet with 
gorbachev on wednesday krenz then will travel to poland for talks 
with the noncommunist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and the 
communist party leader mieczyslaw f rakowski 
krenz has expressed willingness to discuss reforms but also has 
emphasized the communist partys leading role 
since he took over authorities have made several concessions to 
popular demands including granting an amnesty for thousands of 
people who fled the country or were caught trying to do so it has 
promised eventual freedom to travel to the west 
but street demonstrations continue and many activists are 
skeptical saying east germanys leaders are only interested in 
reforms that do not challenge their monopoly on power 
there has been speculation east germanys central committee 
meeting nov 810 will purge aging politburo members closely 
associated with honeckers 18year rule 
west germanys bild newspaper reported that honeckers wife 
margot had lost her post as education minister the newspaper 
cited wellinformed sources in its report 
adn in reporting on tuesdays meeting of the 21member 
politburo said the body discussed proposals on cadre questions 
to be considered at the central committee session the word 
cadre applies to topranking party personnel 
two politburo members economy chief guenter mittag and 
propaganda chief joachim herrmann were removed when honecker lost 
his job amid an exodus to the west of thousands of east germans 
dissatisfied with his rigid rule 
also tuesday adn reported that harry tisch will resign after 14 
years as head of the statecontrolled federation of trade unions 
tisch is also a member of the politburo it was not immediately 
clear if he would keep that post 
several trade union organizations around the country had 
demanded tischs resignation adn reported it said tisch will step 
down thursday 
many young east german trade unionists have charged that the 
federation has been serving only the interests of the government

the chairman of a house panel investigating 
cereal makers health claims said tuesday that pressure by the 
white house budget office has allowed food manufacturers to lie 
about the ability of their products to prevent disease 
rep ted weiss dny likened the problem to snake oil 
salesmen of old who made outrageous claims about miracle cures 
weiss criticized the food and drug administration for letting 
the rulemaking process be circumvented so that food companies 
could put health benefit claims on their products without 
government scrutiny 
he said fda did so under pressure from the office of management 
and budget 
i am concerned that the agency empowered by congress to make 
the federal governments health policy is not performing that 
function said weiss chairman of the house government operations 
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations 
instead an ideologically driven omb has seized the controls 
of the healthpolicy ship 
weiss remarks came as he opened a subcommittee hearing at which 
dr frank young head of the fda testified omb officials are 
scheduled to testify nov 8 
weiss said the fda in 1987 changed an 81yearold policy against 
specific disease preventive advertising on food to allow 
manufacturers particularly those making cereal to make false or 
misleading claims 
without the strongest action from fda to stop the misleading 
claims we are approaching total chaos in the marketplace 
weiss said 
we have a large fiber war young said adding that the fda 
realized there was a problem with its 1987 action that set in 
motion the flurry of ad campaigns emphasizing health claims 
he said he met with omb about the issue as part of the process 
followed in setting fda policies but he said he didnt recall any 
undue pressure from omb to refrain from correcting the problem 
young said four hearings would be held around the country to 
gather testimony to demonstrate a consensus for a rule to correct 
the situation 
weiss was particularly critical of the way the 1987 decision 
allows cereal makers to use psyllium a soluble fiber and 
advertise that it can lower cholesterol 
in letters to general mills and kellogg co the fda said there 
were wellknown safety concerns associated with use of 
psyllium including possible allergic reactions 
last month the fda asked general mills maker of benefit 
cereal and kellogg co maker of heartwise and bran buds to 
submit scientific data to show that the levels of the grain in 
their products is safe 
weiss said and young agreed that because of the 1987 decision 
a cereal company can make claims about the health benefits of a 
substance such as psyllium even though the fda has not proved that 
it is safe and effective 
the issue of whether psyllium is a drug or a food additive was 
raised by the procter amp gamble co which uses psyllium in its 
metamucil laxative the company asked the fda to pull benefit off 
the market because the cereal had not been subjected to 
drugtesting requirements 
bran buds has been on the market for a year benefit is being 
sold in selected test markets but heartwise is not on the market 
yet 
general mills has a warning on the benefit package saying that 
consumers should gradually increase the amount eaten starting 
with one half serving and gradually reaching a full serving 
always consume benefit with milk if digestive discomfort 
occurs consult a physician and avoid laxatives child should limit 
consumption to one serving per day says small print on the 
package 
a spokesman for quaker oats co which has been sued by the 
texas attorney general for health claims on its packages said the 
company supports fda efforts to provide a uniform tough but 
fair series of regulations 
the problem with any allout ban on health messages for food 
products is that in trying to reduce the potential for false and 
misleading statements it could also prevent consumers from 
receiving useful truthful and scientifically supported information 
that can benefit their health said luther mckinney quaker oats 
senior vice president

that he will cancel the 19month ceasefire in the war with the 
contras 
the strongly worded resolution approved 950 demands ortega 
renew his commitment to the ceasefire and conduct elections 
scheduled for feb 25 in a free fair and open manner 
it expresses concern that ortegas cancellation of the 
ceasefire could be a prelude to a sandinista effort to cancel or 
postpone the elections 
ortega had been scheduled to officially announce tuesday whether 
he would call off the ceasefire but his spokesman said the 
announcement had been postponed until wednesday 
even ortegas strongest apologists in congress are having a 
hard time coming up with excuses for this one said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas referring to the declaration 
made by ortega that he would end the ceasefire because of alleged 
violations by the contras 
ortega made the announcement while attending a hemispheric 
meeting of heads of state in costa rica 
dole said the senate resolution is a means of letting ortega 
know that we all of us both parties across the political 
spectrum are not going to put up with this outrage 
the resolution sends the message that enough is enough dole 
said 
hes up to his old tricks and hes treating us to the same 
tired tap dance of tyranny dole said 
this resolution expresses the dismay of the senate said 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
after so much hope has been invested in the electoral process 
to have daniel ortega in such a cavalier manner announce that he 
is going to resume the conflict is an outrage to all civilized 
mankind said sen bob graham dfla 
what clearly has happened is that a very strong signal of 
intimidation has been sent to the people of nicaragua by daniel 
ortega graham said 
the senate resolution calls ortegas action totally 
unjustified a major breach of the sandinista regimes commitments 
to its democratic neighbors and its own people and a serious threat 
to regional peace and stability 
it calls on ortega to end his reckless rhetoric

president daniel ortega postponed 
until wednesday a decision on whether to end a 19monthold truce 
with usbacked contras a government official said 
a spokesman at the presidents office said an evening news 
conference to announce a decision was put off because ortega was 
still meeting with senior defense and interior ministry officials 
and this meeting will last a long time 
well have the announcement very early wednesday she said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
president bush has left open the possibility that he would seek 
military aid to the contras if ortega went ahead with his plans to 
break the truce 
ortega traveled tuesday with an american diplomat to a site 
where ortega said a rebel attack the night before left four people 
dead and five wounded 
ortega disrupted a summit last week by threatening to end a 
truce with the contras he cited rebel attacks as a major reason 
presidential spokesman maria antonia cuadra told the associated 
press ortega would probably make his truce decision announcement 
from san miguelito the town where the government claims a contra 
attack took place monday night 
john leonard the us charge daffairs was invited to 
accompany ortega to the site but leonard sent embassy political 
adviser valentin martinez instead foreign ministry spokeswoman 
mercedes borge said 
ortega and martinez who is fluent in spanish spoke privately 
for about five minutes at the farm cooperative that was allegedly 
attacked near san miguelito about 200 miles southeast of managua 
on the shores of lake nicaragua ms borge said 
the two traveled by helicopter accompanied by defense minister 
humberto ortega the presidents brother and foreign minister 
miguel descoto interior minister tomas borge and officials from 
the united nations and the organization of american states 
the leftist sandinista government and contra leaders agreed to a 
truce in march 1988 nicaragua has extended it on a monthly basis 
since but lowlevel fighting continued the latest extension 
expired tuesday 
on friday ortega told a meeting of 17 western hemisphere 
leaders in san jose costa rica he would end the truce the heads 
of state including bush had assembled to honor the 100th 
anniversary of costa rican democracy 
ortega said his decision was prompted by increasing contra 
attacks in the past three weeks and a rebel ambush earlier in the 
week that killed 18 people many contra fighters have moved to 
nicaragua from camps in neighboring honduras in the three months 
since a central american peace agreement was signed aug 7 
reaction in san jose was so negative ortega backed off and said 
there were ways the truce could be extended he left the meeting 
abruptly saturday 
after ortegas announcement bush called him a little man 
and an unwanted animal at a garden party 
contra leader enrique bermudez said tuesday the nicaraguan army 
already had broken the truce 
the sandinistas have been waging a silent war against our 
forces he said in an interview in tegucigalpa capital of 
honduras now they are trying to make that war public because 
they are facing defeat in the feb 25 presidential elections 
the contras say they do not initiate attacks and act only in 
selfdefense 
barricada the sandinista party newspaper quoted military 
leaders in north central matagalpa province tuesday as saying 
soldiers were ready to respond to the latest terrorist 
expressions of the contras estimated to number 1200 in that 
area 
it quoted deputy commander orlando talavera regional security 
chief as saying 18 contras had been killed in the area since 
friday 
in san jose on friday presidents oscar arias of costa rica and 
carlos andres perez of venezuela reminded ortega the peace plan 
signed by five central american presidents aug 7 provided 
mechanisms for resolving disputes 
provisions of the plan include disbanding the contras by early 
december in return for ortegas pledge the nicaraguan elections 
feb 25 will be free and fair 
congress allows only nonlethal aid to the contras but bush 
said tuesday he might seek renewed military aid if the civil war 
resumed 
i would reevaluate this situation in a minute if the 
ceasefire is broken he told a news conference in washington 
both the united states and contra leaders want to keep the 
rebels intact as a fighting force to make sure ortega keeps his 
promise about the elections congress suspended military aid to the 
contras in february 1988 
on monday secretary of state james a baker iii said threats by 
ortega to suspend the truce might be a prelude to cancellation of 
the elections for a president and national legislature 
in an interview the same day with nbc news ortega said the 
elections are taking place in nicaragua period with contra or 
without contra they are going to take place definitely with war 
or no war that is elections are taking place 
his government says 700 people have been killed and more than 
1000 wounded in rebel attacks since the truce was agreed upon in 
march 1988

the soviet legislature approved a 1990 budget 
tuesday that cuts the deficit in half to the equivalent of about 
100 billion by reducing military spending and capital outlays 
members approved the budget 3576 after a tie vote of 181181 
that in effect rejected a proposal for 10 percent reductions in the 
budgets of the government news agencies tass and novosti and state 
radio and television 
a proposal to raise the prices of beer tobacco and luxuries 
went down 33844 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the legislators in remarks 
carried on television we have made a big step toward healing the 
financial and economic situation by adopting this document but 
these are only our decisions to implement them in life we have to 
work harder than we ever worked before 
he said the budget still was not satisfactory but we have to 
stop here because it stems from reality 
gorbachev commented at the end of a fivehour joint session of 
the two houses of the supreme soviet and after foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in moscow and president bush in washington 
said the two presidents would meet meet on dec 23 aboard naval 
vessels of the two nations in the mediterranean 
shevardnadze denied us media reports that possible us 
economic aid to the soviets would be on the summit agenda 
tass said the 1990 budget anticipates income of 4299 billion 
rubles 6934 billion at the official exchange rate and 
expenditures of 4899 billion 7902 billion 
those figures are almost exactly what the government proposed in 
september and if the government sticks to them it will halve this 
years deficit of 120 billion rubles 193 billion the us 
deficit in fiscal 1990 is required by law to be no more than about 
110 billion 
officials proposed a cut in the defense budget this year from 
773 billion rubles 125 billion to 709 billion 1143 billion 
and large reductions in expenditures for new factories and 
equipment 
gorbachevs economic planners say the country must make better 
use of the resources it has rather than constantly building new 
factories and buying new equipment 
tass said the final budget and economnic plan calls for sharply 
higher production of consumer goods a sore point with citizens who 
face perpetual shortages it also said the budget allocates 134 
billion rubles 216 billion to improve living standards but was 
not more specific 
the attempt to reduce the budgets of tass novosti and the 
gostelradio broadcast conglomerate appeared to be an expression of 
frustration over reporting by the official media opponents of the 
cuts said agencies needed the money to report more rapidly and 
accurately

gather information about iraqs economic and military industrial 
targets and information about the political situation and the 
morale of the people during and after the gulf war 
a ceasefire halted the persian gulf war between iran and iraq 
in august 1988

answers into arabic it was not clear when the interview was

that an explosion at a military industrial complex south of baghdad 
may have killed about 700 people iraq reported the death of 19 
people in what was described as a fuel depot explosion 
the british government has protested to iraq about bazofts 
detention

the food and drug administration waiting for 
direction from congress on tuesday again extended its deadline for 
deciding whether to ban red dye no 3 in foods drugs and cosmetics 
on the grounds that it causes cancer 
this extension pushes the deadline to jan 29 1990 it had been 
wednesday there have been dozens of previous extensions in the 
19yearold controversy 
the agency had been prepared to ban the dye when the house voted 
in july to require further studies before deciding on a ban the 
requirement was added to an appropriations bill after it had been 
passed by the senate 
but last month house and senate negotiators deadlocked over the 
issue and decided to give the fda conflicting advice 
house conferees stood fast on their wish to see more studies 
while senate conferees agreed the fda should follow existing law in 
deciding whether the dye should be banned both positions were 
included in the appropriations bill which is still being hashed 
out in the conference committee 
the deadline was extended to see whether congress clarifies its 
position before final action on the bill said an fda source who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity as the case stands it appears 
the agency would have to ban red dye no 3 said the source 
the controversy over the dye dates to 1960 when congress called 
for a ban on foods that cause cancer in laboratory animals red dye 
no 3 was put on a provisional list that allowed it to stay on the 
market for an additional two years pending further study

president bush on tuesday blamed congress for 
failure to act on his legislative proposals and vice president dan 
quayle joined the attack saying its time to pass stalled budget 
legislation and get on with it 
weve told them what we want and i wish theyd get some 
action going on the proposals that i have put forward i think the 
american people are entitled to that bush said at a news 
conference 
while the president and vice president fueled the partisan 
wrangling between the white house and capitol hill the 
administration also reached a compromise to end a lenghthy battle 
with democrats over raising the minimum wage 
the agreement involving concessions on the part of both the 
white house and the democrats would take the minimum wage to 425 
by 1991 and couple it with a subminimum training wage for 
teenagers with little work experience 
but battling continued on other issues as republicans dismissed 
a democratic offer to resolve differences over passage of a federal 
debt ceiling needed to avoid government default by next week 
that and other legislative matters have been stalled by what has 
become the most dominant issue in congress bushs proposal to cut 
the capital gains tax 
bush blasted congress when asked about capital gains 
were not in the posture of trying to tell the congress how 
they ought to resolve these difficulties we sent up clear 
proposals on the anticrime package on the minimum wage on the 
capital gains and it has gotten so confusing up there that they 
ought to move now he told reporters i think the american 
people see that it is this congress that is frustrating getting the 
deficit down and so they ought to move and move promptly 
but bush said he would not specify how congress should resolve 
the matter 
i cant sit there and finetune for them well if youll 
only throw this one issue in with that one why you can do your 
business he said 
quayle put out the word that the administration is going to make 
congress the whipping boy for the inability to agree on legislation 
in a speech to the american stock exchange quayle said that 
on feb 9 president bush submitted his budget to the congress 
today is oct 31 and the budget reconciliation package is still on 
capitol hill and has not passed the congress 
now it is congress responsibility to pass a budget 
reconciliation and to get on with it he said its time to get 
on with the nations business 
capital gains has become the dominant issue before congress 
blocking agreement on a 16 billion deficitreduction bill 
legislation to boost aid to poland and hungary and on the measure 
raising the governments debt ceiling 
the white house comments came as congressional democrats and 
republicans swapped offers on plans for passing a new federal debt 
ceiling needed by next week to avert a default by the treasury 
and other pressing fiscal legislation 
despite the allure of wrapping up the session before 
thanksgiving senate republicans rebuffed the offer because the 
democrats wouldnt give up their procedural blockade of a capital 
gains tax cut 
we all gave it a horse laugh we assume theyre not serious 
said sen william armstrong rcolo following a gop lunch 
this would kill capital gains and it was deliberately designed 
to do so i hope it is rejected out of hand said sen bob 
packwood rore a chief sponsor of the proposal prior to a white 
house afternoon meeting 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine announced a parliamentary plan to 
secure senate action on a separate capital gains bill not tied to 
other budget work however mitchell said he wouldnt surrender the 
right to filibuster the bill a threat of endless debate which can 
only be stopped by a 60 vote majority 
the democrats also offered to strip from the fiscal 1990 
deficitreduction bill a democraticsponsored child care initiative 
republicans countered with an offer of their own that would 
allow quick passage of debt limit and deficitreduction 
legislation and pile the capital gains tax cut a rollback of the 
medicare catastrophic care program and several other controversial 
proposals into a single measure 
we too want to get the job done and get it done on time

a state licensing board tuesday refused 
to reopen the case of an optometrist who had some women patients 
strip to the waist but put him on three years probation and told 
him to stop performing such exams 
in an order filed later tuesday the board of optometry 
examiners said optometrist gary fisher committed a serious error in 
judgment but insisted the state did not prove that there was any 
motivation by dr fisher which was in any way unethical 
the panel voted to tell fisher to stop the screening 
examinations in which women patients were asked to partially 
disrobe during the probation fisher can continue to practice 
fisher has said he no longer performed the exams 
fisher was called before the board on ethics complaints after 
some women patients complained to police in monticello in eastern 
iowa he said he was checking for curvature of the spine or 
scoliosis because he thought it was linked to some eye disorders 
no connection has been proven to exist between scoliosis and 
any eye condition the board noted his motivation was to 
attempt to find the underlying causes for his patients 
conditions 
referring to its initial hearing the board said in the written 
order that the evidence did not show there was any voyeuristic or 
any other kind of sexual motivation and said there was no 
sexual physical conduct 
last month the board voted to reject the complaints saying 
fisher was honestly attempting to provide the best care 
the iowa board of medical examiners sought to have the case 
reopened saying fisher had strayed into the practice of medicine 
for which he was not licensed the attorney generals office also 
asked the board to reconsider 
the medical board had threatened a lawsuit if fisher was not 
stopped from performing the examinations 
the case also raised questions about professional regulators 
operating in secret the board tuesday conferred privately for 2 
hours before voting unanimously without debate or explanation 
after the issue first surfaced both fisher and the optometry 
board defended themselves but have since refused to comment on the 
advice of lawyers 
fisher said he was being harassed and said the issue was fully 
aired before the optometry board he had asked that the hearing be 
closed 
the board after 20 hours of hearing two full days 
exonerated me completely said fisher now im being retried in 
the press 
the optometry board is made up of five optometrists and two 
members of the public all appointed by gov terry branstad

democrat l douglas wilder sitting on a 
15point lead in a poll on virginias 25 million campaign for 
governor said tuesday he hopes he will be judged on his 
accomplishments rather than his race 
ive never lost an election and i think its too late to 
start now wilder the states black lieutenant governor told a 
girls school audience 
wilders republican opponent former attorney general j 
marshall coleman showed no signs of giving up before the nov 7 
election 
coleman 47 spent the day campaigning from southwestern bristol 
on the tennessee border to the atlantic ocean resort city of 
virginia beach 
a poll published sunday in the washington post showed wilder 
leading coleman 52 percent to 37 percent giving a boost to 
wilders contention that racism plays no part at all in a 
campaign that could produce the first elected black governor of a 
us state 
coleman said he did not believe the polls findings and im 
not going to sit still for it the poll has a margin of error of 
3 percent which means the results could be off by that amount 
coleman held a news conference in bristol with members of 
virginias fraternal order of police which endorsed his candidacy 
the organization backed wilders bid for lieutenant governor in 
1985 
during a questionandanswer session with students at st 
catherines school a mostly white private episcopal school 
attended by members of upperincome richmond families wilder 58 
was asked whether he was concerned that the racial symbolism of his 
candidacy might overshadow any of his initiatives 
i hope the shadow isnt there wilder said he said his 
campaign was geared to the idea that education and economic 
development are the greatest social equalizers 
when people judge his record wilder said he hopes the judgment 
will be based on performance and what i look like wont be 
considered 
in richmond meanwhile the national right to work committee 
released a tape recording of a private meeting between wilder and 
united mine workers members last summer wilder appears to say he 
would support an amendment to the states righttowork law that 
could require nonunion members to pay dues to unions negotiating 
bargaining agreements on their behalf 
the committees political arm plans to begin airing radio 
commercials in support of coleman using portions of the tape 
committee president reed larsen said he didnt know who made the 
recording and if he did i wouldnt want to carry the fire 
insurance on his house 
wilder met the umw members july 31 in castlewood in the wake of 
a bitter violenceplagued strike still under way in the southwest 
virginia coalfields against the pittston coal group inc 
according to an edited transcript of the recording wilder said 
the righttowork law has as much chance of being scrapped as a 
snowball in hell and that he supports the law then he added i 
have to do that 
asked whether he would support a socalled freerider 
amendment allowing labor contracts in which nonunion members could 
be required to pay union dues wilder responded thats 
correct according to the transcript 
wilder spokeswoman bj northington said the tape was an effort 
to make something out of nothing were not surprised by this 
the lieutenant governor has consistently supported the 
righttowork law 
colemans press secretary jay timmons said the republicans 
campaign did not know ahead of the release what was on the tape

palestinians on trial in sweden uncovered apparent links to the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 which killed 270 people in scotland 
last dec 21 according to court records 
the four are charged here in connection with the preparation of 
five bombs used in 1985 and 1986 against us and jewish targets in 
stockholm copenhagen denmark and amsterdam the netherlands one 
person was killed and dozens were wounded in the bombings 
court records examined by the associated press on tuesday 
showed that mohammed abu talb thought to be the squad leader 
visited malta in october 1988 that mediterranean island nation was 
believed to be the point of origin for the bomb that destroyed pan 
am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
air malta on tuesday denied published reports that the bomb may 
have been transferred to frankfurt west germany on a malta 
flight inside an unaccompanied suitcase it said its flight to 
frankfurt on dec 21 1988 carried 39 passengers and 55 pieces of 
baggage 
all pieces of baggage have been accounted for and every one of 
the 39 passengers has been identified air malta said in an 
official statament 
west german investigators suggested a maltese connection on 
monday 
scottish investigators have contended for months that the bomb 
was put on the jet in frankfurt where flight 103 originated 
passengers and luggage were transferred to a boeing 747 at heathrow 
airport in london 
other court documents here showed tuesday that swedish police 
arrested a brother of two defendants on suspicion of smuggling 
plastic explosives to the west german apartment where the pan am 
bomb was believed to have been assembled 
the brother was released last november for lack of evidence 
prosecutors told the ap that parts of the investigation against him 
were classified 
on trial are abu talb 35 marten imandi 35 mahmoud said al 
moghrabi 24 and mustafa elmougrabi 23 moghrabi and mougrabi 
are brothers their names are spelled differently on the charge 
sheet 
prosecutor stefan karlmark said before the trial opened oct 16 
the swedish investigators were not probing the pan am bombing 
since it was not relevant to their case 
he also said he found no link between the four and the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command the group 
suspected of the pan am bombing 
abu talb has admitted belonging to the palestine popular 
struggle front which like the pflpgc is an extremist faction 
which rejects the moderate policies of the palestine liberation 
organization 
according to his passport abu talb was in malta oct 1926 
1988 after spending one day in cyprus 
the passport supports a report in the new york times tuesday 
that abu talb was seen in malta that month with hafez dalkamoni 
the suspected pflpgc officer now in custody in west germany in 
connection with the preparation of bombs 
the times quoted us officials as saying abu talb retrieved an 
altitude bomb assembled in an apartment in neuss west germany and 
passed it on to another person the bombs packed in radiocassette 
players detonate when the plane reaches a preset altitude 
sixteen members of the pflpgc were detained in a sweep by west 
german police oct 26 1988 at the neuss apartment seizing bombs 
similar to the one believed to have destroyed flight 103 all but 
two have been released 
abu talb was quoted by the times as telling investigators he 
passed on a bomb overlooked in the raids

the delicate task of removing the 
steeple from earthquakebattered st patricks church began 
tuesday with the fate of this heavily roman catholic communitys 
spiritual heart still in doubt 
the diocese of monterey has not issued a final decision on 
whether it will demolish the 86yearold red brick church or try to 
save it said the rev mike miller the parish priest 
the final verdict isnt in yet said miller but said there 
was only a remote chance the california gothicstyle building could 
be saved 
reports on the churchs fate have changed almost daily 
workers are expected to take two to five days to remove the 
60foot woodandcopper tower and four 20foot spires surrounding 
it said mike bertrand of bay cities crane amp rigging inc 
the work will cost 350000 miller said he said it would cost 
about 25 million to replace or rebuild the church in this city of 
30250 people about 100 miles south of san francisco 
about two dozen people including several of the churchs 
estimated 4000 parishioners watched as a large crane removed the 
first of the four smaller spires sending red brick tumbling to the 
ground 
it was an especially sad moment for carlos rico a local market 
owner who was baptized confirmed and who celebrated his first holy 
communion at st patricks 
rico 49 proudly produced a copy of his yellowed first 
communion certificate dated may 9 1948 
this is my church said rico taking pictures of the steeple 
removal its been here since i dont know how long i dont know 
what were going to do now 
since the oct 17 earthquake parishioners have crowded into the 
gym at moreland notre dame high school across the street for 10 
masses every sunday 
parishioner joe herber a watsonville resident since 1962 and a 
former teacher at watsonville high school said he hoped the 
building could be saved 
my daughter was married here herber said this is the 
cornerstone of the community 
diocese officials want to preserve as much of the original 
building as possible miller said the church was built by irish 
immigrants in 1903 
along with the steeple and spires officials hope to save the 
huge stained glass windows decorating the church one of millers 
personal favorites depicts st patrick tossing the snakes out of 
ireland 
diocese officials also want to save the damaged pipe organ 
miller said 
the churchs front altar was destroyed in the quake but a 
number of items including several statues of saints survived and 
have been removed for safety 
this is a really amazing building herber said it 
withstood the 1906 earthquake with flying colors and its still 
standing despite damage from this last quake maybe well save it 
yet

nigel lawson whose resignation as britains top 
treasury official has rocked the government on tuesday attacked 
prime minister margaret thatchers attitude toward europe and 
hinted he quit because she interfered 
for our system of cabinet government to work effectively the 
prime minister of the day must appoint ministers that he or she 
trusts and then leave them to carry out the policies lawson told 
the house of commons 
when differences of view emerge they should be resolved 
privately and whenever appropriate collectively 
earlier mrs thatcher shouting above scenes of nearuproar in 
the commons faced a barrage of opposition taunts over lawsons 
resignation 
opponents also accused her of robbing britain of an effective 
role in the european economic community by balking at linking the 
pound to europes other major currencies the key dispute between 
her and lawson 
he quit last thursday saying he could not continue as long as 
mrs thatcher kept her personal parttime economic adviser sir 
alan walters who opposed full british membership in the european 
monetary system ems that links nine european currencies walters 
later resigned too 
the new chancellor of the exchequer john major pledged that 
economic policy would not change he said he will stick to the 
lawson strategy of increasing basic bank interest rates now at 15 
percent as the main tool of dampening inflation 
major sounding more enthusiastic than mrs thatcher about full 
ems membership added the question is not whether we should 
join but when 
mrs thatcher reiterated her stringent conditions for joining 
the exchange rate mechanism of the system including free movement 
of capital she gave no date for membership 
opposition labor party legislators declared she has no intention 
of joining the ems fully before the next election which must be 
held by mid1992 
they attacked during a debate called by labor on tuesday seeking 
to censure the conservative government for its handling of the 
economy as expected the opposition censure motion was easily 
defeated by a vote of 342 to 238 
in this party ministers decide and advisers only advise 
said mrs thatcher who has a 101seat majority in the 650member 
house of commons 
on europe she added we believe in europe a europe based on 
a free economy not a regulated bureaucracy dictating to this 
house from brussels 
as lawson rose to speak publicly for the first time since 
resigning the rowdy scenes subsided in the commons 
intervening in the debate on the troubled economy lawson 
described walters stance on british membership in the european 
monetary systems exchange rate mechanism as the tip of a 
singularly illconcealed iceberg with all the destructive potential 
that icebergs possess 
britains destiny lies in europe it is vital that we 
maximize britains influence in the community 
i have little doubt that we will not be able to exercise that 
influence effectively as long as we remain largely outside the 
ems so for economic and political reasons alike it is important 
that we seek the earliest practicable time to join rather than the 
latest for which a tolerable case can be made 
mrs thatchers popularity ratings have slid further behind 
labor in the furor critics including some within the party 
redoubled charges she is autocratic and fails to consult or listen 
to the rest of the 22member cabinet

millionaire businessman and tv 
entertainer silvio santos on tuesday announced he would run for the 
brazilian presidency two weeks before the election a move analysts 
say could alter the outcome of the campaign 
santos 59 who says he knows little about politics told 
reporters during a raucous press conference at the congress he 
would run under the small and relatively unknown brazilian 
municipalist party 
santos is owner of sbt network the countrys second largest 
and host of a 6hour sunday raffle and prize show that is immensely 
popular among brazils poor 
santos sudden candidacy coming 15 days before the countrys 
first direct presidential election in 29 years was labeled as 
opportunism by businessmen and the work of presidential 
operatives by other candidates 
analysts said santos could hurt two leading candidates fernando 
collor de mello of the centerright national reconstruction party 
and luis inacio lula da silva of the radicalleft workers party 
both candidates rely heavily on support from brazils lower classes 
a sharp lastminute swing at the polls was possible since the 
majority of the electorate has not become overly enthusiastic about 
any of the 22 candidates in the race wrote clovis rossi a 
columnist for the respected folha de sao paulo newspaper 
antonio ermirio de moraes one of brazils leading businessmen 
called the announcement handiwork of the presidential palace 
to weaken collor de mello a harsh critic of president jose sarney 
collor de mello who holds a twotoone lead over his closest 
opponent in nationwide polls said he would try to invalidate 
santos candidacy with a law that requires public personalities to 
stop their professional activities three months prior to the 
election 
santos a descendent of greek immigrants worked as a street 
vendor before gaining national attention for amassing a fortune 
that today includes a a tv network a bank a chain of supermarkets 
and stores 
on nov 15 82 million brazilians a majority of them from the 
lower class are to choose sarneys successor for a fiveyear 
term the first popular vote for president since 1960 
if no candidate wins a majority on nov 15 the two top 
votegetters will face each other in a runoff in december

savaldors decadeold civil war that has killed 70000 people most 
of them civilians a rebel mortar attack on the defense ministry in 
san salvador on monday killed one person and injured 15

of the national union of salvadoran workers the countrys largest 
labor federation he commented at a news conference held amid the 
rubble at fenastras 
arena is the republican nationalist alliance the governing 
party

a terrorist act and asked all salvadorans to try to put an 
end to these kinds of actions which only bring mourning pain and 
death

inaccurate homemade mortars in cities

terrorism and even leftist politician ruben zamora who maintains 
formal links with the rebels termed the attack incorrect and 
condemnable as a violation of the geneva accords

weapons in populated areas because their inaccuracy resulted in 
civilian casualties

military compound housing the ministry and the joint chiefs of 
staff 
half the projectiles were way off their mark and the other half 
landed on surrounding streets sidewalks and businesses

lebanons rival cabinets clashed on 
tuesday over a complaint sent to the un security council by 
hardline christian leader gen michel aoun protesting the presence 
of syrian troops here 
also tuesday seven algerian army officers arrived in beirut to 
help set up a security zone for a parliament meeting to elect a new 
president for lebanon despite aouns opposition to convening such 
a meeting 
aouns forces fought six months of artillery battles with the 
syrian army that killed more than 900 people 
in the name of his threeman cabinet aoun asked un secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar to distribute his cable as an 
official document to security council members it did not request a 
debate on the issue 
we reserve the right to ask for a formal security council 
session on the syrian and israeli occupation of lebanese 
territory the cable said the text was released by aouns 
administration 
we wish to lay stronger emphasis on the occupation of the 
syrian army of the greater part of this territory it said 
about 40000 syrian troops control 70 percent of the territory 
in lebanon which has been rent by 14 years of civil war the 
syrians deployed in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
but aoun said in march they betrayed the mandate by siding with the 
moslems and declared a war of liberation against them 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the rival 
syrianbacked cabinet asked the security council in a separate 
telegram to ignore the complaint 
hoss said the protest was illegitimate because he said 
aoun does not represent all of lebanon 
aouns move came after separate meetings with the ambassadors of 
britain france the soviet union and china representing four of 
the five permanent member states of the security council 
the united states withdrew its diplomatic mission from lebanon 
on sept 6 complaining of harassment by aoun supporters 
the algerian officers will now await instructions from arab 
league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi a police spokesman said 
ibrahimi assistant secretarygeneral of the 22member arab 
league heads a security committee comprising representatives of 
aouns 20000strong mainly christian army as well as the main 
warring factions in lebanon 
he said monday he was optimistic that the parliamentary 
session to elect a new president will be held before nov 7 
sixtythree of lebanons 73 surviving parliamentarians attended 
a special session in taif saudi arabia in october and agreed to a 
peace plan to end the civil war in their country 
the plan was brokered by an arab league committee comprising 
the leaders of saudi arabia morocco and algeria 
aoun a maronite catholic has rejected the peace accord and 
threatened to dissolve the parliament because the plan does not 
include a fixed timetable for syrian withdrawal from lebanon

a government official said tuesday 
a tacit agreement has been reached with united press 
international but declined to confirm that the news agency would be 
able to continue operating in panama 
interior minister renato pereira last thursday complained of 
publication of false news and ordered upis panama operations 
stopped he gave its foreign personnel 72 hours to leave the 
country upi denied the allegation and asked for a reconsideration 
of the decision on monday 
we have reflected on the problem and we have arrived at a type 
of tacit agreement in the sense that upi is going to be more 
careful in the writing of news that is produced in panama and this 
ministry agrees to give a constructive solution to the difference 
between the panamanian government and upi pereira said 
he talked with reporters after a meeting with upi vice president 
pieter van bennekom 
pereiras statement indicated the agency would continue to 
operate but when asked he would only say we are going to give 
a constructive solution in the next few hours 
he said it would be a constructive solution in the most 
generous sense of the term 
we are waiting for a decision from the authorities said van 
bennekom 
van bennekom said the solution does not affect freedom of 
expression 
in its order the ministry said upi had systematically 
violated journalistic ethics through the publication of false news 
with the evident intention of discrediting authorities of the 
republic of panama and damaging the image of its leaders 
the agency filed a request for reconsideration on monday saying 
the stated reasons for the order were not true nor had they been 
previously proven legally 
the trip by van bennekom from upis washington office to panama 
to talk with authorities was a demonstration of good will on the 
part of upi toward the government and as a result the case deserves 
to be resolved in a constructive way pereira said 
upi has operated in panama since the 1930s its chief 
correspondent is tomas cupas a panamanian elizabeth lordan an 
american has been at the office for a year

workers searching the twisted wreckage of 
interstate 880 found the bodies of a woman and a man in separate 
vehicles two weeks after the earthquake a police spokesman said 
tuesday 
the body of joyce ann mabry 31 of berkeley calif was found 
around 7 pm monday said alameda county sheriffs sgt jim 
knudsen around 7 am tuesday searchers found the body of james 
j flores 39 of rohnert park knudsen said 
were checking the vehicles for personal belongings knudsen 
said we have no reason to believe there are any more bodies 
there 
the discoveries raised the death toll in the quakes worst 
disaster to 41 and the overall number of people who died in the 
quake to 66 
mabry was the mother of a 3yearold boy and flores had a 
teenage child 
its a terrible thought to think that sombeody you love is up 
there in the rain the cold the night and its hard to decribe 
but were glad hes down flores brother leonard said after 
the body was recovered 
those who survived the catastrophe struggled to recover from 
their injuries 
cathy scarpa 37 remained hospitalized tuesday with multiple 
fractures in both legs and a crushed hand suffered when her carpool 
van was smashed in the collapse of interstate 880 in oakland five 
of the university of californiasan francisco coworkers who were 
with scarpa a registered nurse and health education were killed 
in the van 
there were some services for the people who died and it was 
hard not to be a part of that its hard to be here dealing with 
all this and not being a part of normal life said scarpa 
sometimes through tears from her bed at eden hospital in castro 
valley 
scarpa is one of dozens still hospitalized with broken limbs and 
other injuries suffered in the devastating earthquake oct 17 that 
killed 64 crippled the san franciscooakland bay bridge and 
buckled a 1mile section of the i880 freeway in oakland 
in all 2874 people were treated and released and 439 were 
hospitalized enough to fill a large hospital according to a 
survey conducted last week by the california association of 
hospitals and health systems 
perhaps the most famous patient is buck helm the feisty 
longshoreman trapped for four days in the squashed wreckage of his 
car on i880 he was listed on tuesday in serious condition at 
highland hospital in oakland 
julio berumen the 6yearold whose leg was amputated during his 
rescue at i880 and his 8yearold sister cathy both were listed 
in good condition on tuesday at childrens hospital in oakland and 
the hospital said they were improving daily the youngsters lost 
their mother in the freeway collapse 
among those still clinging to life tuesday was margaret 
fitzpatrick a ucsf employee who was riding with scarpa she 
remained in critical condition at eden hospital in a near coma 
with multiple internal injuries said hospital spokesman thomas 
mcgarry 
scarpa remembers the upper level of the freeway dropping 20 feet 
and concrete raining down on the van crushing it like a fist 
smashing an aluminum can she remembers a coworker in the smoky 
darkness crying oh my god 
her legs trapped under the dash are fitted with pins and she 
is awaiting a bone graft it will be six months before she can 
stand and only then will therapists begin teaching her to walk 
again 
for now she looks forward to a visit from her dogs and is 
comforted by mail from wellwishers including a friend she hadnt 
seen in 12 years 
its tremendous i cant believe the calls and mail and 
balloons from friends and people ive worked with on projects 
said scarpa 
until sunday carmen smith 64 was unable to discuss his 
20foot fall off the i880 structure that left parts of his spine 
crushed 
he said it was like being in a washing machine while it was 
going said christi welter spokeswoman for san jose medical 
center where smith underwent a second operation on friday smith 
who is in stable condition was driving his truck when the elevated 
freeway collapsed 
from the beginning he was having such nightmares he was 
reliving what was happening he thought he was going to die 
welter said 
neither the state hospital association nor its northern 
california counterpart has determined how many victims remain 
hospitalized but they estimate the number at dozens 
in all 48 of the 112 hospitals in the nine quakestricken 
counties treated or admitted patients and the state hospital 
association estimated that the hospitals suffered 25 million in 
damage themselves 
watsonville community hospital close to the epicenter of the 
quake was hardest hit its chief administrator paul estess put 
damage at 2 million 
in the frantic hours after the quake watsonville community 
hospital lost its water supply and part of its electrical power and 
had to evacuate all patients who could walk onto the lawn estess 
said more than 300 people were treated in the outdoor emergency 
room and 12 were admitted with a variety of injuries while others 
were airlifted or taken by ambulance to other hospitals 
neither the federal emergency management agency nor the state 
office of emergency services has compiled an estimate of the total 
cost of medical treatment for the injured officials said 
in other developments 
the state legislature will convene in special session thursday 
to consider raising 800 million for quake relief with a oneyear 
quartercent sales tax increase to begin in time for the busy

its not often a playwright gets a second chance 
with a play much less a third 
terrence mcnally has had three productions of the lisbon 
traviata done in new york since 1985 and the latest incarnation 
which opened tuesday at offbroadways promenade theatre is the 
most satisfying yet 
what the playwright has done is more than refine the second 
version performed earlier this year at manhattan theatre club he 
has radically changed its ending and deepened the characters 
particularly its protagonist a bitter cynical and selfcentered 
homosexual named stephen 
mcnallys play deals with the comic and tragic sides of 
obsession in this case the adoration of opera star maria callas 
the comedy occupies most of act 1 and is anchored in the 
character of mendy played with comic bravura by nathan lane 
swaddled in a sagging red satin bathrobe mendy sashays through 
the first act mocking every opera diva except the divine maria 
she is his reason for living and when stephen tells him he has a 
pirated recording of callas la traviata sung in lisbon mendy 
must hear it 
stephen shares that obsession and has another obsession of his 
own the breakup of his relationship with michael a doctor who 
has found someone else this triangle becomes the focus of the 
emotionally charged second act 
in earlier versions it was difficult to shift gears to make 
the adjustment from the wicked hilarity of act 1 to the dramatic 
fireworks of act 2 
mcnally has made the play less violent but also more believable 
he has sacrificed a grand almost operatic gesture for what is a 
more likely and much sadder conclusion 
other members of the mtc cast repeat their performances here 
anthony heald is remarkable as the unhappy and sour stephen its a 
difficult role halfway between hero and villain heald 
successfully negotiates the contradiction dan butler plays his 
lover with dignity and a quiet intensity that is compelling while 
john slattery is fine as the man who comes between them 
this new production confirms that the lisbon traviata is one 
of mcnallys best plays full of slashing savage wit and an added 
dimension of humanity that comes from its much more realistic and 
ultimately more moving finale

officials at a federal hearing into a 
jet crash that killed 112 people said tuesday they are not ready to 
conclude that a hairline crack in an engine fan disk caused the 
dc10s engine to explode 
james nall the national transportation safety board member in 
charge of the sioux city hearing said no final decision on the 
cause of the july 19 united airlines crash will be issued for 
months after the full ntsb meets to review testimony 
this is simply a portion of the investigation part of the 
early stages of it nall said on the first of four days of 
hearings 
investigators are focusing their study on a disk from the 
airplanes tailmounted engine they believe a flaw in the disks 
metal caused it to explode sending pieces of metal ripping through 
the airplanes tail section and severing the hydraulic lines that 
give pilots control of the aircraft 
a report released tuesday said the fan disk of the jets rear 
engine had a hairline crack less than a halfinch long before the 
planes final flight 
a federal aviation administration official said last week that 
tests on the fan disk indicated the crack was caused by a flaw in 
the metal that probably was present when the disk was made 18 years 
ago by general electric co 
but ntsb officials said they have drawn no final conclusions 
united airlines spokesman robert doughty also said tuesday that 
it is too early to pinpoint the cause of the engine explosion 
doughty said experts have only had 12 days to study the disk 
a full analysis takes two months he testified its 
really premature to make a judgment 
the ntsb report is based on detailed testing of the fan disk 
found in two pieces in corn fields near alta about 80 miles east 
of sioux gateway airport where the airplane cartwheeled and burst 
into flames as pilots tried to make an emergency landing 
the report by ntsb senior metallurgist james f wildey ii said 
the disk had two cracks but that only one existed before the 
explosion the report said that crack was visible to the naked eye 
after the accident but did not say whether the crack was 
detectable earlier 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said wildey did not attempt to 
determine whether the crack was detectable before the crash 
lopatkiewicz also said the report does not conclude that the 
crack was due to a flaw in the titanium disk that might have 
existed for years 
wildley is scheduled to testify wednesday 
in another written report to the ntsb flight simulator expert 
john c clark said united pilot al c haynes had virtually no 
chance to make a safe landing after the hydraulic systems lost 
fluid clark assembled a panel of experts who used flight 
simulators to fly a dc10 with no hydraulic controls 
the consensus of the group was that the pilot could fly the 
airplane but an adequate landing could not be accomplished within 
the pilots control clark said in the report 
engineering test pilot phillip battaglia of mcdonnell douglas 
which built the dc10 testified that the company had not 
anticipated an explosion severing all three hydraulic lines 
battaglia said that since there was no precedent the company 
did not have instructions on how a pilot should deal with such a 
problem and said it was unlikely any instructions could help a 
pilot safely land anyway 
its my opinion that this is not a trainable maneuver he 
said 
the plane cartwheeled to a stop at the edge of a cornfield on 
airport property which hampered rescue efforts said the airports 
fire chief 
firefighters had trouble dousing the burning aircraft and 
locating survivors because of the standing corn said james 
hathaway of the iowa national guard the guard is in charge of 
firefighting at the airport 
the corn did provide refuge for those fleeing the burning plane 
acting as a barrier to the radiant heat he said 
the airport leases land along its runways to farmers at the 
time of the crash the corn stood 6 feet or taller 
faa regulations allow crops to be grown on airport land and 
officials say the practice is common in the midwest but a proposed 
faa advisory to airports recommends that farming be limited and 
that crops not be planted within 1200 feet of any runway center 
line

eighteen sparrow and 20 sidewinder missiles went down in the 
deep water but the nonnuclear airtoair missiles posed no risk 
the navy said 
they were not nuclearpowered they were not armed said 
another spokesman senior chief petty officer cindy adams 
therefore theyre harmless 
the sailors were knocked overboard by a wave while they moved 
the missiles and other ordnance and gear from the flight deck down 
to the hangar deck

carrier crashed on the uss lexington in the gulf of mexico killing 
him and four people on the ship the navy refused thursday to

accident investigation said fred hoffman a defense department 
spokesman in washington

missile cruiser uss reeves in the indian ocean injuring five 
sailors

turret of the battleship uss iowa in april the blast killed 47 
sailors 
hoffman said he saw no connection between the recent navy 
accidents hoffman said the navy has an excellent safety record 
johnson said he had no figures on how common it is for a sailor 
to be washed overboard and lost 
according to news reports there have been at least four 
incidents this year in which sailors have fallen or been swept from 
vessels

indian newspapers on tuesday published 
documents they said show prime minister rajiv gandhi may have been 
personally involved in payoffs and coverups in the bofors arms 
scandal 
the government issued a statement denying the reports which 
come barely three weeks before a national election in which 
gandhis opponents have made corruptioningovernment their battle 
cry 
gandhi is fighting for his political life in what is expected to 
be the closest election in indias 42 years of independence 
three major englishlanguage indian dailies carried the reports 
they were the hindu and the statesman which are traditionally 
independent and the antigandhi indian express 
the calcuttabased statesman said the possibility of the 
prime minister himself being involved in the payoffs and in 
initiating coverup operations in the wake of the bofors disclosure 
has finally emerged with references in official documents to 
meetings between the representative of a company involved in the 
payoffs and a gandhi trustee lawyer 
indian express a nationwide paper and gandhis harshest critic 
among the major media was blunter saying direct and 
irrefutable evidence is now in hand which establishes the 
direct involvement of the prime minister mr rajiv gandhi and his 
intimates in the corrupt bofors payoff 
about nine hours after the newspapers reached readers the 
government information office issued a statement denying gandhi was 
involved 
the scandal arises from a 14 billion contract signed in 1986 
by gandhis government and the swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors 
according to accounts previously published by indian newspapers 
bofors paid up to 50 million in kickbacks to beat out competitors 
for the contract 
tuesdays newspaper reports were the most direct purported link 
between gandhi and the alleged payoffs previous reports spoke of 
money going to people close to gandhi 
gandhi repeatedly said he did not personally benefit from the 
deal he denied any commissions were paid or that any indians 
received payments 
the latest stories focused on purported entries in a personal 
diary kept by former bofors company president martin ardbo 
the key element according to the statesman and indian express 
is a handwritten entry that speaks of a meeting between an unnamed 
gandhi trustee lawyer and a person identified only as bob 
in geneva on july 2 1987 
the newspapers said bob was robert wilson a former british army 
major who headed ae services a company previously cited by indian 
and swedish newspapers as a middleman in the bofors contract

china has issued regulations requiring all social 
organizations to be registered and giving the state power to 
disband any of the groups that are deemed undesirable the official 
press said wednesday 
the new rules the first of their kind since 1950 say that no 
social organization including societies research units 
foundations and chambers of commerce will be legal unless approved 
by appropriate authorities 
on tuesday chinas legislature also passed a law giving the 
state broad powers to ban public rallies and demonstrations that it 
deems to be threatening to social order or antigovernment 
the two measures are linked to government efforts to tighten 
controls over public gatherings following the student movement this 
spring in which up to 1 million people took to the streets of 
beijing to demonstrate for democratic reform 
the movement crushed by military force in june also spawned 
independent student and worker groups that the government has 
labeled as illegal antirevolutionary and designed to overthrow 
communist rule in china 
the new regulations state that social groups will be prohibited 
from profitmaking activities and that the civil affairs ministry 
and its departments will have the power to approve and disband 
organizations 
the china daily said there are 1100 national organizations and 
about 100000 local community groups many it said have an overly 
close connection with government departments and some are 
disrupting economic order by engaging in illegal businesses and 
profiteering 
it said secret societies and underworld gangs that existed 
before the communists came to power in 1949 have returned to some 
lesserdeveloped and coastal areas 
the daily quoted civil affairs vice minister fan baojun as 
saying the new rules will ensure ordinary citizens freedom of 
association and define the legal rights of social groups

police arrested 51 juveniles who ignored a 
devils night curfew tuesday night the last night of the 
traditional threeday halloween arson outbreak and firefighters 
got some relief as the number of fires apparently dwindled 
few fires were reported tuesday night on monday night dozens 
of blazes flared across the city in trash bins and abandoned 
buildings and at least five families homes burned there were no 
injuries either day 
officials refused to disclose any information about fires until 
wednesday afternoon earlier in the day city councilman mel ravitz 
said that the number of blazes had already surpassed the 229 set 
last year 
weve got to find a way to either reeducate or incarcerate 
those who engage in this sport he said 
mayoral spokesman bob berg said 51 youths had been arrested by 
10 pm tuesday raising the number arrested since devils night 
and the 6 pm to 6 am curfew began sunday to 385 
police arrested 165 youths monday and 169 sunday said police 
sgt christoper buck those arrests included four for investigation 
of arson 
during curfew police are allowed to detain children under age 
18 overnight if they are caught on the streets without a parent 
devils night is a decadesold tradition but youths went from 
soaping windows to arson about 10 years ago 
the blazes apparently peaked in 1984 when firefighters battled 
808 blazes in the last three days of october the number of fires 
has declined steadily since then 
penny thomas blamed devils night revelers for a blaze that 
flared in an abandoned house next door and destroyed her home 
monday night 
the house just went to burning in the front and me and my 
friends we ran out of the house thomas said 
fire capt amos horton said arson that gutted another abandoned 
house jumped to an occupied home before dawn tuesday 
we dont know what started it or who started it but somebody 
definitely started it horton said when a place is going like 
this is going we know it was set 
civilians have joined the battle against arson this year about 
30000 signed up to patrol the streets reporting curfew violators 
and trying to spot fires before they spread 
the strategy is aimed in part at relieving overworked 
firefighters of patrolling so they can devote all their time to 
dousing flames

let history record that on nov 10 those 
willing to pay 950 for some er culture can see thunder and 
mud a paytv special that features heavy metal rock female mud 
wrestling and jessica hahn 
there may be those who say youre kidding 
to them jessica hahn would say that there will be such a show 
that it runs 90 minutes that she is the hostess and that its 
not masterpiece theater its a little crazy 
im just there for the pr if you ask me says the former 
church secretary whose sexual encounter with television evangelist 
jim bakker led to his loss of his ptl empire in 1987 
bakker has been sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined 
500000 for defrauding his followers for his own enrichment hahn 
now lives in west hollywood calif where she gave several 
interviews about him last week 
she told reporters she wasnt satisfied with the sentence given 
bakker she is pretty much talked out about him she now says but 
shes fully aware that its always going to be identified with me 
because in one sentence here and there in interviews im always 
asked about it 
a cheerfulsounding woman despite occasional verbal rocks cast 
at her by those who are without sin hahn readily acknowledges that 
her thunder and mud stint and earlier entertainment ventures 
are due to the publicity she got when the bakker matter first 
surfaced 
of course one thing led to another she says she cites her 
playboy magazine appearance talk show visits and frequent onair 
joking with howard stern the muchpublicized bad boy of new york 
radio 
hes a crazy man but i love him says hahn 
last year she also was featured in a wild thing video that 
aired on mtv the video spoofed rock videos and starred sam 
kinison the comic who screams 
he sang wild thing or screamed it whichever and i kind of 
fooled around she says she describes her latest venture taped 
last month as kind of a battle of the bands with a twist 
the twist is that female mud wrestlers grapple with each other 
while rock bands grapple with music each wrestler she says 
represents a different band the bands have names like nuclear 
assault tuff and sherok

it may take white house tutoring in remedial 
lipreading to keep republicans in line with president bushs 
acrosstheboard vow that there will be no new taxes 
theres been some gop talk about boosting the federal gasoline 
tax notably by the senate republican leader thats an idea that 
has been advanced before usually by democrats to raise money and 
promote energy conservation at the same time 
a gas tax boost is one bush vehemently ruled out when he was a 
candidate and his spokesman did so again the other day democratic 
leaders already had said they were not going to risk advocating a 
tax increase the president would block and the gop would use 
against them later 
everyone has read his lips said sen george mitchell 
dmaine the majority leader 
but sen robert j dole of kansas the gop leader said he would 
be for an increase as long as the money it raised went to finance 
the highway system and wasnt earmarked to reduce the national 
debt as sometimes has been proposed i would support a gas tax 
increase for rebuilding the infrastructure not for debt 
reduction dole said sunday 
sen pete wilson rcalif said earlier that he would support a 
gas tax increase if needed to rebuild earthquakedamaged highways 
in the state where hes running for governor next year 
but theres no real chance the tax now 91 cents a gallon is 
going to be increased bush isnt budging and democratic 
congressional leaders are not going to take on the political burden 
of pushing an unpopular tax increase against his opposition 
the new round of tax talk grew out of the need for disaster 
funds for california and to repair the damage caused by hurricane 
hugo in the east 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said when the senate 
passed a disaster relief appropriation that the earthquake and 
hurricane should have awakened us to the fact that we do not have 
the revenues we need to build and maintain vital physical 
infrastructure 
he said bush had an opportunity to say so despite his campaign 
refrain that he would tell congress read my lips no new 
taxes 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee was advocating an increase in the gasoline tax 
long before the disaster hit 
so has alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board 
who said a higher tax would encourage conservation and lower 
american dependence on foreign oil which is increasing steadily 
each one cent increase in the federal gasoline tax raises about 
1 billion a year a prospect that led to earlier proposals for a 
sharp increase to reduce the federal deficit gas tax revenues go 
into the highway trust fund roadbuilders the oil industry and 
allied interests are determined to keep it that way 
dole appearing on the nbctv program meet the press said 
hed read bushs lips too and hadnt forgotten the injunction 
against new taxes but wouldnt consider a roadbuilding gas tax to 
be a major increase 
the distinction did not register at the white house we do not 
feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is necessary at this 
time said press secretary marlin fitzwater 
when the government began the interstate highway system in 1956 
it was to be financed by a federal gasoline tax of 3 cents a 
gallon advocates of an increase say that if the gasoline tax had 
kept pace with inflation it would now be at least 13 cents a 
gallon instead of 91 
with gasoline prices down petroleum imports are increasing in 
july oil imports accounted for more than half of us consumption 
for the first time in a dozen years the department of energy 
estimates that the import rate will reach 65 percent by the year 
2000 
we are getting back into all the old habits getting more and 
more dependent on foreign oil moynihan said 
but the idea dole endorsed isnt going anywhere without bush 
which means it isnt going anywhere house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash said he favors an increase but would push one only if it 
came with an ironclad bush endorsement 
were not going to engage in a kamikaze effort to raise 
taxes mitchell said

holy box office whats a caped crusader to 
do after being the hit of the summer hes the flop of the fall 
in norway at least 
despite an extensive promotional campaign here the megabuck 
smash movie batman has been upstaged at the box office by 
licence to kill and indiana jones and the last crusade 
in norway even donald duck has been more popular than the 
batman comic for decades 
inspired by its worldwide success the movie has grossed more 
than 248 million at the us box office alone and has set 
alltime opening weekend records in italy spain mexico portugal 
and britain the films distributor hoped to trigger a little 
batmania in norway 
warner bros norge as the movies distributor wallpapered much 
of norway with batman posters and stickers in its biggest 
promotion campaign ever in this small scandinavian country 
batwho responded norwegians 
few had heard of batman even under his norwegian comic book 
name lynvingen or lightning wing when the comic first appeared 
here in 1953 lynvingen was the name chosen because batman 
literally translated means something like the fluttering mouse man 
warner bros norge kept the original title batman for the 
movie and set out to make it a household word with a promotion 
campaign that was unusually agressive by norwegian standards 
newspapers widely reported the hubbub preceding the film which 
inspired such inventions as batdances and batdrinks norwegians who 
were caught up in the fad bought batman hats tshirts posters 
toys and trinkets all emblazoned with the familiar winged 
silouette 
but few bought tickets to the movie 
batman got walloped at the box office during the first two weeks 
after the movies opening oct 5 it drew 26427 in oslo compared 
to 50761 for the james bond film licence to kill and 51133 
for indiana jones and the last crusade according to the oslo 
muncipal cinemas which rated the sales as not good 
when the blockbuster premiered in 36 norwegian cities many of 
the 40 theaters were less than onethird full 
batman hasnt played to our expectations said lillemor 
kosell of warner bros batman is somewhat of an american 
phenomenon people dont know him very well this was by far the 
biggest promotion we ever attempted here she refused to disclose 
the amount spent 
among critics batmania became batmoania one wrote batman 
was better before he got here 
the movies billboards posters and fullpage newspaper 
advertisements succeeded in spreading batmans name but in the 
weeks before the premiere many norwegians still wondered why he 
climbed around on buildings in his pajamas and a cape 
anders giaever a reporter and comic book collector tried to 
help with the beginners guide to batman published in the oslo 
daily arbeiderbladet 
the whole thing is a little foreign said giaever 
norwegians dont have the background most havent seen the 
comic and the tv series was never shown here 
but the modest level of batmania in norway has nothing to do 
with comic books movies television or even batman said gro 
svendsen of the oslo department store steen and stroem which sells 
batman hats and tshirts 
norwegians read so much about batmania in america that its 
the fad the fashion itself they are interested in she said 
sales are nothing phenomenal compared to products inspired by 
a film like et but batman tshirts are big with the skateboard 
set 
the skateboard set 12 to 14yearolds might have flocked 
to the movie had the the age limit not been set at 15 kosell said 
the state film control board deemed batman too violent for 
children 
kjell johnsen the 22yearold editor of the local batman 
comic linvingen said the movie might boost his comics sales 
which are lackluster compared to donald duck and other best sellers 
one happy note for gotham citys dark prince because of warner 
bros promotion the comic books name will be changed back to 
batman

in kitchens at factories and on construction sites 
across japan foreigners are doing jobs the japanese no longer want 
to do shaking up a country unaccustomed to living with people of 
different colors 
japans growing reputation in the third world as a promised land 
is attracting workers from pakistan and bangladesh who can earn as 
much in a day as they can in weeks or even months back home 
chinese eager to make their fortune come posing as vietnamese 
boat people in hopes of gaining political asylum and africans 
ignore local prejudices against blacks to earn money to send home 
the estimated 100000 or so illegal workers and tens of 
thousands of working foreign students have an influence far beyond 
their numbers in a population of 120 million 
tokyo commuter trains used to be a sea of smooth black hair and 
familiar japanese faces everyone talked the same language now 
occasional black and dark brown faces and strange tongues are 
making japanese fidget in their seats 
heavy television coverage of boat people and foreign workers is 
bringing the issue into the living rooms of millions while 
hundreds of thousands are working side by side with nonjapanese 
for the first time 
some press comment has been thoughtful 
is it possible for us to enjoy such affluence separate from 
the rest of the world especially the people of neighboring 
countries mainichi shimbun said in an editorial 
but other writers noting the 1 billion people in neighboring 
china have raised visions of aliens pouring in faster than 
mexicans to the united states letters to the editor pages have 
been flooded with fears of cultural invasion crime and crowding 
a 150minute television program on foreign workers by japan 
broadcasting corp in may brought calls from 1000 viewers 20 
times the usual number for such programs a local press report 
said for every person arguing to let in foreign workers two said 
it was a bad idea 
foreign workers will destroy japan is the subtitle of a book 
by critic kanji nishio the book with a large padlock pictured on 
the cover is called recommendation for a closed country sakoku 
in labor using the same word that shoguns used to ban foreigners 
from japanese shores for centuries 
generally favoring entry for foreign workers are small 
businessmen thousands of whom have gone bankrupt because of a 
severe labor shortage for parttime jobs in such fields as 
construction and restaurants openings outnumber available workers 
three or four to one 
owners of small laborintensive factories have deluged refugee 
authorities with job offers for the boat people even as mass 
deportations are being arranged 
if it werent for these foreign workers wed go under says 
kenichi masuda in his familys centuryold castiron foundry 
elderly japanese blackened from head to toe with soot shovel coke 
from the dirt floor into a furnace and pour molten iron into molds 
in a dimly lit wooden building 
young japanese dont want to do this dangerous dirty work 
masuda shouts above the clank of machinery pointing out a chinese 
working for him legally on a government training program 
at a neighboring foundry 29yearold paul aduna from ghana in 
africa works for 900 yen 642 an hour under the same program 
originally designed to transfer manufacturing skills to developing 
countries 
at 630 am at a recruiting center for day laborers in tokyo 
crewcut construction foremen pass over the few aging japanese men 
reclining on cardboard and reeking of alcohol 
young eager neatly dressed chinese students wave away an offer 
of 800 yen about 6 an hour about 25 times what theyd make in 
china 
too cheap hes crazy one says 
with an offer of 1250 yen about 9 the chinese pile into a 
van to be taken to a construction site 
i used to work in new york says george a malaysian who 
asked that his name not be used but the money is a lot better 
here 
in the sprawling neon jungle of kabukicho tokyos answer to new 
yorks 42nd street thousands of women from the philippines 
thailand and korea work in bars sex shows and prostitution most 
brought in by japanese gangsters 
in tokyos immigration office thais ghanaians bangladeshis 
pakistanis and chinese stand in endless lines hoping in a babel of 
languages to persuade bureaucrats to let them stay a few more 
months 
most foreign laborers work illegally after entry on tourist 
visas or student visas that allow only parttime work unlike many 
developed countries japan has no legal provision to allow 
foreigners to enter as unskilled laborers 
big business and the government want to keep it that way 
although small businesses lobby the government to allow more 
foreign workers industry leaders argue for greater investment in 
machines to solve labor shortages 
even many japanese who want foreign workers for temporary help 
worry that they will settle here and disturb japans social 
harmony but many of the foreigners stung by japanese prejudice 
say they dont want to stay 
a 25yearold chinese woman said she came in part because of 
japans reputation as an advanced country in part because of the 
japan millionaires returning to her hometown to build big 
houses and flourishing businesses with their tokyo earnings 
a japanesechinese translator in china she and her technician 
husband came on student visas and work long hours after classes 
their dream she says was to learn about japanese business and 
technology and build a powerful japanesestyle conglomerate back in 
china or at least save some money and start a small business 
but now after months working in a dry cleaning shop and then in 
a japanese pub she says shes disappointed in a country she used 
to admire even though she earns in a day what would take a month 
in china 
materially the japanese are very advanced but not 
spiritually she says if you are white they treat you well 
but if you are darkskinned or asian they look down on you 
she said some coworkers taunted her after they saw chinese boat 
people on television saying why dont your people stay where 
they belong 
i tell them we are like bus no matter how many you squash 
more come back she said

after years of tight budgets american 
scientists hope the 1990s will introduce a new golden age of 
space exploration this is one of a periodic series of articles 
the 90s looking ahead to the promise and peril of the 
upcoming decade in the environment medicine technology and

the manned station freedom an 
orbiting outpost of america in the icy silence of space will take 
center stage in the us space effort in the 1990s and be a 
springboard for human journeys to the moon and mars 
american scientists also expect to reap a rich harvest during 
the decade with an armada of sophisticated unmanned spacecraft that 
will explore the planets and peer back into the beginning of time 
at the same time the soviets will continue development of a 
space shuttle and exploit their own space station mir as they 
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to mars early in 
the 21st century 
and the growing space programs of the european space agency 
japan and china will expand as they embark on their own manned 
space efforts 
as the new decade begins americas future course is uncertain 
its space program is at a crossroads and it will be up to the bush 
administration the congress and the people to decide which 
direction it should take 
in july on the 20th anniversary of mans first landing on the 
moon president bush stood on the steps of the national air and 
space museum and declared we must commit ourselves anew to a 
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system and 
yes the permanent settlement of space 
he proposed a longterm continuing commitment to completion 
of space station freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on 
the moon and a manned mission to mars early in the next century 
but the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such 
grand schemes instead directing vice president dan quayle as head 
of the national space council to work out the details 
bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his state of 
the union address early next year 
freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan since 
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more 
ambitious flights to the moon and mars 
but the space station has had a troubled history the original 
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin 
assembling it in orbit in 1992 with a total of 20 shuttle flights 
needed to have it fully operational by 1995 
cost overruns budget cuts and nasas poor job of selling the 
station to a skeptical congress have delayed the project and 
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996 
the us cost will be about 25 billion with european japanese 
and canadian partners contributing modules and other station 
facilities worth an additional 8 billion this will give 
astronautresearchers of these nations access to the station and 
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent 
manned space programs 
orbiting 250 miles up the station would provide living and 
working quarters for as many as eight people with astronauts 
rotating back to earth after four to six months some would stay 
longer to gain longterm exposure to weightless living in 
preparation for a mars flight that might take as long as 18 months 
as a scientific base the station will allow humans to study the 
stars and planets from the pollutionfree environment of space the 
weightless world will permit the processing of new pure medicines 
metals and other products that cannot be made in earths gravity 
and astronauts aboard freedom would assemble service and repair 
satellites and send them out to explore space 
space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of 
neglect because of tight nasa budgets 
we are embarking on a golden age of space science said 
lennard fisk the agencys associate administrator for space 
science and applications whats coming up is an era of 
unprecedented excitement and activity 
among the events scheduled in the 1990s 
magellan launched from a space shuttle last may is to orbit 
venus next august and will study that planet for several years 
galileo launched from a shuttle in october is to orbit 
jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere en route 
galileo will probe venus and take the first closeup look at an 
asteroid 
cobe cosmic background explorer set for launch nov 19 will 
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by 
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of 
light or photons permeating the universe 
rosat a cooperative mission with west germany will be 
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of xrays emitted 
into the universe by violent explosions such as those occurring at 
the end of a stars life 
hubble space telescope to be launched from a shuttle next 
march will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far 
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed 
14 billion years ago near the time scientists believe the universe 
was formed 
mars observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet 
for a multiyear examination 
other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the 
next few years include a series of astro spacecraft carrying 
ultraviolet and xray telescopes to study quasars pulsars and 
other celestial objects the gamma ray observatory to explore gamma 
ray sources throughout the universe and ulysses to probe the sun 
during the 1990s nasa will also continue research together 
with the defense department on developing the national aerospace 
plane which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and 
accelerate into orbit if congress provides adequate funding for 
this nextgeneration manned space vehicle a prototype could begin 
test flights late in the decade and it could become operational 
sometime after 2000

astronomers soon will be able to 
look out almost to the beginning of time to study how the universe 
began and how it has evolved 
their window will be the hubble space telescope the most 
expensive most finely crafted unmanned space vehicle ever built 
scheduled for release into earth orbit next march by a space 
shuttle crew the 17 billion telescope will become astronomys 
most significant tool in expanding our knowledge of the universe 
during the 1990s and into the 21st century 
it will be one of the premier science missions of this 
century said lennard fisk director of space sciences for the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
orbiting 370 miles high this 25500pound 435footlong 
package of precision instruments will look seven times more deeply 
into space detect objects 50 times fainter and view them with 10 
times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory thus 
expanding the universe visible to humans by 350 times 
at the heart of the telescope named for edwin p hubble a 
trailblazing american astronomer of the 1920s is a 945inch 
primary optical mirror the most precise ever made there is no 
bump or ripple on its highly polished surface that deviates more 
than onemillionth of an inch from an ideally perfect curve 
from its vantage point outside earths murky atmosphere the 
telescope will be able to probe a distance of 14 billion light 
years offering views of galaxies so distant they will appear as 
they were when the universe was formed the best ground telescopes 
look back only 8 billion years 
astronomers enhancing the telescopes images with computers will 
gain new knowledge about black holes pulsars cosmic dust clouds 
gaseous nebulae supernovae neutron stars quasars and other 
celestial mysteries 
said james westphal a california institute of technology 
planetary scientist i suspect that we will find some amazing 
things that will thrill the public not once a year but maybe once 
a month

after two academy awardnominated portrayals 
of vindictive women versatile glenn close returns in another 
guise as a married woman seeking to adopt the baby of an unwed 
teenager 
immediate family is the apt title of the columbia pictures 
release in which close and james woods play a childless couple who 
seek the child of young mary stuart masterson and her 
leatherjacketed boyfriend kevin dillon 
its a phenomenon in this country called open adoption 
explained close instead of there being a big mystery about who 
the parents are and where they came from they used to seal the 
files especially from the child as a reaction to that its open 
who the parents are the adoptive parents and the birth parents as 
theyre called get together it really is the decision of the 
birth mother as to who she going to give the child to 
what happens if the birth mother changes her mind later 
its very difficult after all the legal procedures to get a 
child back she said there is that horrible period between 
when youre given the child and everything is taken care of legally 
when the mother can change her mind and many women do i think 
thats the terrible emotional minefield 
once the legalities are done its hard to reverse it i 
dont know the statistics on how often that happens i know people 
who send christmas cards to the birth mother and people who 
correspond more than that i would think that the child would want 
to know who the mother is have pictures of her and maybe even meet 
her he would consider adoptive parents as parents what they 
really are thats the world that he knows 
immediate family follows two stunning portrayals for close 
as the murderous career woman in fatal attraction and the 
scheming marquise de merteuil in dangerous liaisons in both 
films she wreaked dire revenge on men who had spurned her but she 
doesnt consider the women evil 
a tragic victim out of control is her assessment of the 
fatal attraction protagonist 
and i think ultimately the marquise de merteuil is a victim of 
her society she added thats my subjective viewpoint yeah 
they were dangerous people but they were also trying to survive 
is it possible to play a role without feeling any sympathy for 
the character 
i dont think it is whenever i approach a role there always 
has to be a place where i can identify with her humanity and 
basically love them 
close gives dimension to her role as the barren linda spector in

strange horrible limbo situation 
and i dont think people really knew what to do with me id

just had to have that time and place which was barnum on 
broadway and george roy hill who put me in garp after seeing me

interest rates on shortterm treasury 
securities rose in mondays auction which included a couple of 
unusual twists to enable continued operation of the government 
despite a decline in its borrowing authority 
the treasury department sold 78 billion in threemonth bills 
at an average discount rate of 778 percent up from 752 percent 
last week 
another 78 billion was sold in sixmonth bills at an average 
discount rate of 762 percent up from 75 percent last week 
the rates were the highest since oct 2 when threemonth bills 
sold for 783 percent and sixmonth bills averaged 792 percent 
the new discount rates understate the actual return to investors 
805 percent for threemonth bills with a 10000 bill selling 
for 979900 and 804 percent for a sixmonth bill selling for 
961050 
mondays auction differed from the usual weekly sale in two ways 
because of the expected drop in the governments debt ceiling at 
midnight tuesday from 287 trillion to 28 trillion 
to ensure that the lower ceiling does not stop social security 
checks from going out this week the treasury department required 
buyers of the threeand sixmonth bills to pay for those securities 
tuesday rather than on thursday as usually would be the case 
and the treasury auctioned an additional 2 billion on monday to 
take full advantage of the 287 trillion borrowing authority 
before it expires on tuesday 
the average discount rate for the new 51day bills was 787 
percent but it too understates the actual return to investors 
807 percent for a 10000 bill selling for 988850 
the house has voted to raise the debt ceiling to 31 trillion 
for the current fiscal year but senate legislation has been 
blocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax 
in a separate report the federal reserve said monday that the 
average yield for 1year treasury bills the most popular index for 
making changes in adjustablerate mortgages fell to 781 percent

for liquor marketers tis the season to be 
inventive 
as the christmas season approaches liquor makers and importers 
have come up with magazine ads that talk when the page is 
opened dazzle with a hologram and provide peelandstick decals to 
liven up a dull party scene 
the ads which are each costing 500000 to several million 
dollars to produce and place in magazines ranging from business 
week to rolling stone are designed to boost sales at a critical 
time of year for the liquor industry 
liquor industry analysts said the holiday season which includes 
thanksgiving christmas and new years day accounts for 30 percent 
to 40 percent of annual sales in some categories of the distilled 
spirits business an industry with little to cheer about in recent 
years 
health concerns tougher enforcement of drunkendriving laws an 
increase in the legal drinking age to 21 and calls for tougher 
restrictions on liquor marketing have taken a toll on consumption 
of alcoholic beverages 
according to the distilled spirits council per capita 
consumption of liquor fell 31 percent to 154 gallons last year 
from 159 gallons in 1987 it has fallen every year since peaking 
at 2 gallons per person in 1978 
john maxwell jr who follows the beverage industry for the 
investment firm wheat first securities inc in richmond va said 
consumption of all alcoholic beverages has been declining due to 
liftestyle changes 
but the products promoted in some of this years unusual holiday 
ads are among those categories that claim sales growth 
the house of seagram for instance is spending an estimated 3 
million to 4 million on offbeat ads for chivas regal scotch whisky 
and crown royal canadian whisky 
the fourpage chivas ad which will appear in holiday issues of 
newsweek and business week among others asks the question what 
if you dont give chivas regal for christmas 
readers presumably rich ones are invited to tear away tabs 
that reveal the humorous consequences of failing to give chivas to 
people like the gardener or the pool man answers the gardener 
may pave the lawn while the pool man could put sharks in the pool 
in an ad for crown royal seagram has a foldout photograph of 
eight bored partygoers stewing in an elegantly furnished room the 
ad carries 15 peelandstick decals with items such as santas 
elves hats and boxer shorts with kisses that readers can use to 
liven up the stuffy drawingroom scene 
the crown royal ad is appearing in rolling stone and gq among 
others 
thomas k mcinerney executive vice president for marketing at 
house of seagram said he hopes readers will have some fun with the 
ads 
if we can get them to stop for 15 seconds or 30 seconds that 
would be a success he said 
if readers have fun with an ad the theory is they become more 
favorably disposed toward the product and will remember the brand 
name when stocking up for a holiday party or buying a gift 
absolut vodka has come up with a talking ad that uses a 
microchip to offer spoken holiday greetings in metallicsounding 
english italian and spanish each time its ad is opened 
absolut is spending 12 million to include the ad in 200000 
december issues sent to vanity fair subscribers in new york state 
and california 
finlandia vodka is using a hologram that shows a bottle of the 
drink and the outline of two reindeer in combat on the label in an 
ad that will appear in the yearend double issue of rolling stone 
distributed in new york chicago and california and the christmas 
gifts issue of new york magazine 
the ad cost about 500000 to produce and place in the 
magazines and is being billed as the first liquor ad to use one of 
the 3d images 
mcdonalds corp used a hologram for a 1988 ad that appeared on 
the back cover of national geographic which also had a hologram on 
the front cover 
jim beam brands co decided to make a variation of its new ad 
campaign that shows evolving consumer tastes in everything from 
sandwiches to underwear 
in its christmas ad for jim beam bourbon the company shows the 
evolution of the christmas tree from 1952 to the present from 
standard evergreen to flocked to metallic to sculpted and back to 
evergreen again 
you always come back to the basics is the message that will 
appear in 17 different publications this holiday season including 
playboy working woman and self

prime minister margaret thatcher appears to be 
hardening her position against linking the british pound to other 
european currencies despite mounting pressure from her own 
conservative party 
the growing impression is that mrs thatcher is using an 
increasing number of conditions as a pretext not to link the pound 
to the 10yearold exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary 
system the ems links the currencies of nine of the 12 common 
market nations to prevent wide currency swings 
since spain joined in june only britain greece and portugal 
are outside the system 
economists now dont expect the pound to be linked before the 
next general election which mrs thatcher must call before 
mid1992 
nations linked to the mechanism enjoy currency stability that 
helps industry and common market planning but they relinquish 
control over an important element of their monetary affairs 
the european economic community is working toward european 
monetary union which would create a single european currency and a 
single central bank for the nations 
but mrs thatcher opposes relinquishing british sovereignty and 
champions freemarket policies 
the issue of british participation in the exchange rate 
mechanism was seen as central in thursdays sudden resignation of 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson which created a cabinet 
crisis and shook british financial markets 
lawson who advocated joining the mechanism said he couldnt 
continue to serve in his post as long as mrs thatchers personal 
economic adviser sir alan walters stayed walters who called the 
system halfbaked resigned hours later 
the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks fueling inflation 
fears and prompting the government to push interest rates to an 
eightyear high of 15 percent as well as intervene repeatedly in 
the market both measures have had limited success 
the pound was quoted at 15785 in europe late monday compared 
with 16665 on july 31 
mrs thatcher used to say that the pound would be linked when 
the time is right then in a compromise during junes eec sumit 
in madrid she agreed to link the pound once capital flowed freely 
in europe and after britains inflation rate now running at 76 
percent fell in line with the lower rates of other european 
countries 
in a sunday television interview she went further saying that 
continental insurance and pension funds must be run as openly and 
freely as britains and that government subsidies of industries 
must end 
you cant have a currency like sterling playing under that 
higgledypiggledy set of rules she said 
france will eliminate exchange rate controls in july she said 
but it will take some time for italy to follow 
i like a strong pound she said but added that only 
intervention and interest rates would keep it that way 
charles bean who teaches economics at the london school of 
economics said monday i certainly interpreted it as a 
strengthening of her preconditions of joining the ems 
robin aspinall director of currency economics at the london 
investment firm hoare govett ltd said it was a reaffirmation 
certainly she has been adamant in her position that was more 
fleshing out the details 
labor lawmaker john smith the opposition partys chief 
financial spokesman said sunday both the tone and content of 
mrs thatchers interview show that she is flatly against joining 
the mechanism for the foreseeable future 
the position of the new chancellor john major is not yet clear 
deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe in a saturday speech 
widely interpreted as a challenge to mrs thatcher said it was 
essential that britain reaffirm its madrid commitment in order to 
maintain confidence among its european partners 
howe was demoted from the more influential position of foreign 
secretary in july apparently for his proeurope views 
bean said many politicians are now advocating joining the ems 
including howe some rankandfile conservative lawmakers and many 
laborites 
joining the mechanism would remove uncertainty about monetary 
policy and would allow britain to lower interest rates without 
hurting the pound bean said 
in addition bean said it makes some difference from a 
political point of view you can argue that it indicates greater 
commitment to europe 
but its not a panacea he said and wont prevent an expected 
slowdown in the british economy 
aspinall said we would have the same dilemma but more of an 
obligation to protect the currency the protection of the currency 
would require us to be intervening or raising interest rates

yet another major wall street house says it will 
curb program trading a computerdriven practice that critics claim 
is dangerously distorting the stock market and scaring away small 
investors 
on monday merrill lynch amp co announced it would halt socalled 
index arbitrage for clients until the stock market calms down 
paine webber group inc took a similar step last week 
kidder peabody amp co said monday it would execute index 
arbitrage trades only for clients not for its own account morgan 
stanley amp co inc bear stearns amp co and oppenheimer amp co made 
similar announcements last week 
index arbitrage involves stockindex futures contracts to buy 
or sell baskets of stocks based on particular indexes like the 
standard amp poors 500 index these contracts have come to represent 
a bigger market than that of common stocks and one with higher 
stakes 
using computer programs traders seek to capitalize on brief and 
minute differences in the prices of stocks and stockindex futures 
by buying or selling stocks with opposite trades in the futures 
it has become entirely typical for stock traders and investors 
to look to the futures market as an indicator of where equities are 
headed the fundamentals of individual companies their earnings 
their marketing strategies and the overall quality of their 
products have fallen by the wayside 
its a disgrace said james j cramer investment manager of 
cramer amp co the market has very little to do with individual 
stocks anymore and trades as a whole from the individual programs 
indeed the stock of telephone and electronic giant contel corp 
is down from a month ago even though it announced a 16 percent 
increase in its quarterly profits a week after the friday the 13th 
stock market plunge 
why chairman charles wohlstetter asked rhetorically what 
the hell for the stock is now selling 5 points below where it was 
before that friday and every bit of information and news that came 
out is better than anybody anticipated 
but wohlstetter is determined to turn attention to trading 
tactics that hurt his company in an interview monday wohlstetter 
said he has talked to about 50 corporate executives who are 
contemplating joining him to complain to authorities in what is 
believed to be the first such effort organized at the corporate 
level he did not name his potential allies 
ill take it to the moon if i have to in order to bring to 
the attention of the corporate world that the stock exchange has 
lost its sense of direction wohlstetter said 
the protest already has begun to take shape in monday editions 
of the new york times neuberger amp berman an investment management 
firm overseeing some 175 billion took out a fullpage 
advertisement imploring stop the numbers racket on wall 
street the ad urged investors to voice their concerns in writing 
to securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden and 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
arguments over unconventional trading strategies came to a head 
following the 1987 black monday market crash but the stock 
markets recent volatility begun oct 13 when the dow jones 
industrial average plunged 190 points in little more than an hour 
has renewed the debate 
virtually all observers agree that a ban on stockindex futures 
is unrealistic particularly since the chicagobased futures 
exchanges have the support of many powerful midwestern politicians 
but many suggest leveling the playing field by raising the 
deposit requirements on futures contracts from 10 percent to 50 
percent making it parallel with margin requirements for stock 
purchases 
with current deposit requirements someone in the futures market 
is able to control 170000 worth of stocks with a payment of 
9000 said larry zicklin a managing partner at neuberger amp 
berman 
if you tried to buy 170000 worth of an underlying stock on 
the new york stock exchange youd have to put up a minimum of 
85000 
while no one knows just how much activity would be dampened by a 
tightening of deposit requirements zicklin speculated it would be 
substantial others go so far as to say such a move would in 
effect wipe out the strategy 
zicklin acknowledges his personal interest in seeing such 
strategies curtailed he neither wants to lose investors who could 
become fearful of market swings caused by index arbitrage and 
program trading nor does he want to see stock prices ease as more 
money is pulled out of the market 
the market has to be able to attract the private investor with 
some degree of comfort that he is not going to be battered around 
during the course of a day said jack barbanel president of 
first global asset management inc in princeton nj he is 
drastically psychologically affected when his portfolio moves up 
and down in the course of an hour 
barbanel noted however that although futures contracts to not 
accurately mirror the value of individual stocks they do correctly 
reflect the value of the market as a whole 
if you up the margin requirement its like punishing the 
instrument instead of punishing the people he said he said he 
favors eliminating index arbitrage rather than trading in index 
futures

the recent rise in chevron corp stock is not 
surprising since it has been undervalued in recent years analysts 
said as share prices continued to climb amid takeover speculation 
chevrons stock closed at 6725 a share in new york stock 
exchange composite trading monday up 87 cents from 6637 
friday chevrons stock has risen about 48 percent this year from 
a low of 4537 
it doesnt surprise me the stock is cheap said charles 
maxwell vice chairman and senior energy strategist for cj 
lawrence morgan grenfell inc dismissing talk that a buyout of 
the nations fourthlargest oil concern is likely 
chevrons share price only recently surpassed its previous high 
of 64 in 1987 after hardly moving during the previous year 
analysts said 
chevron stock is undervalued in relation to its asset value 
but not undervalued in terms of priceearnings ratio said paul 
ting with the investment firm oppenheimer amp co 
chevron rich in oil and gas reserves and a highperforming 
chemicals unit had sales in 1988 of 289 billion down from 291 
billion in 1987 earnings last year totaled 18 billion or 517 
a share up about 40 percent from 13 billion or 365 a share 
its 133 billion purchase of gulf oil in 1984 came just before 
a sharp drop in oil prices the earnings potential of those assets 
as well as its 1988 purchase of tenneco incs oil and gas 
properties in the gulf of mexico for 25 billion have yet to be 
realized analysts said 
chevrons stock has jumped in recent weeks partly on speculation 
that the 
san franciscobased oil concern is ripe for a takeover possibly 
by pennzoil co british petroleum co plc also has been mentioned 
as an interested party 
a chevron buyout would be the largest to date some analysts say 
that in a breakup chevrons assets could be worth 100 to 125 a 
share or approximately 40 billion 
a published report monday suggested that a group of investors 
could be acting in concert to force chevron into a restructuring 
that would boost the stock further 
a buyer possibly a company acting alone or with partners has 
accumulated 12 million to 16 million shares of chevron stock or 
35 percent to 47 percent usa today reported 
chevron spokesman larry shushan declined to comment on the 
stocks purchaser in accordance with company policy 
pennzoil also declined to comment but the houstonbased oil 
company is rumored to be looking for a place to park some 25 
billion in cash that it received in a 1988 settlement with texaco 
inc following a prolonged battle over getty oil co 
how is pennzoil going to buy chevron with 25 billion it 
would have to be a junk bond situation said maxwell adding that 
leveraged deals have lost favor on wall street 
no one is going to let pennzoil have 30 billion to 40 
billion in junk bonds maxwell said 
pennzoil threatening chevron is like a kid threatening mike 
tyson said one securities analyst who did not wish to be named 
constantine fliakos vice president of merrill lynch capital 
markets in a recent newsletter also dismissed speculation that the 
houstonbased company was a serious contender unless pennzoil is 
interested in triggering its own demise in the event that chevron 
were to react defensively 
although some analysts said they saw no evidence of a serious 
takeover attempt featuring either junk bonds or cash a group 
attack is not out of the question they said 
in addition some suggested the possibility of a bppennzoil 
partnership or a bpchevron combination british petroleum which 
has said it wants to boost its west coast properties recently 
denied it would make a major us purchase anytime soon 
in its latest quarter chevrons earnings declined to 417

thrift regulator m danny walls defenders are 
complaining that a house committee chairman is trying to force wall 
to resign before he has a chance to answer the charges against him 
the house banking committee chaired by rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas is scheduled today to conduct its third hearing into the 
collapse of the lincoln savings and loan association irvine 
calif which is expected to become the nations costliest thrift 
failure 
in a letter to president bush released by the committee monday 
gonzalez said walls policy of reviewing in advance the testimony 
of his subordinates in the office of thrift supervision is 
hampering the committees investigations and suggested the 
regulator should step aside 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the thrift agency said the 
suggestion was inappropriate and sen jake garn rutah for 
whom wall once worked as chief aide said it was uncalled for 
obviously rep gonzalez is looking for a scapegoat on which to 
place the blame for the sampl bailout said garn the senior 
republican on the senate banking committee 
the house panel plans to conduct at least one more hearing and 
possibly more before giving wall a chance to respond 
hoyle said he is concerned congress will recess for the holidays 
before wall and top aides get a chance to defend his actions three 
senior thrift agency officials counsel jordan luke regulation 
director darrel dochow and enforcement director rosemary stewart 
had been scheduled to appear today but their testimony has been 
postponed 
dan wall like anybody else in this country is entitled to 
due process quite candidly i think theres a very fine line 
between investigation and prosecution hoyle said 
gonzalez in a letter to bush dated last friday said his panel 
has heard startling evidence that wall blocked efforts by field 
examiners in the thrift agencys san francisco office to collect 
evidence of misconduct by lincoln officials 
the committee is focusing on why wall in 1987 rejected their 
recommendation to seize lincoln and instead ordered another 
examination after the institutions owner phoenix ariz 
millionaire charles h keating jr complained he was being treated 
unfairly by san francisco regulators 
in view of your commitment to not let those responsible for 
these costly failures remain in positions of authority in your 
administration i believe it would be reassuring to the american 
taxpayers who have been asked to pay for this regulatory failure if 
mr wall steps aside gonzalez told bush 
at todays hearing the committee was scheduled to hear from 10 
thrift examiners from around the country who were assembled by wall 
to review the work of the san francisco office

transportation secretary samuel skinner says 
he doesnt need the new authority to deal with airline takeovers 
that a bill before congress would give him 
skinner said monday the legislation which would give the 
transportation department the power to approve or disapprove 
airline mergers before they occur smacks of reregulation of 
the airline industry 
it probably is reregulation and is inappropriate in a 
deregulated environment he said in an interview 
the air carrier securities act which was scheduled for house 
action today would require the department to block purchase of 15 
percent or more of an airline if the sale threatened to hinder 
safety reduce competition break up the carrier or put it under 
foreign control 
skinner currently has the authority to review airline 
transactions for their financial fitness their safety and the 
degree of foreign involvement the law limits foreign interest in 
us carriers to 25 percent of voting stock 
skinner said he doesnt think he needs additional powers to 
prevent a financially unsound takeover 
i think there are other ways i can do it he said we can 
advise individuals who are anticipating a transaction as to 
some of the problems with a transaction if we see any 
the secretary said he had reservations about the planned union 
and management takeover of united airlines but he denied any 
responsibility for failure of the plan financial analysts say 
collapse of the stock buyout move on uniteds parent company ual 
corp triggered the oct 13 drop in the stock market 
the united airlines transaction fell for one reason and one 
reason only it was not sound financially said skinner 
failure of the ual takeover bid followed agreement of skinner 
with alfred checchi to scale down foreign participation in 
checchis stock buyout of northwest airlines parent company nwa 
inc the department concluded the original deal put klm royal dutch 
airlines in a position to control northwest 
responding to reports that other administration officials had 
been critical of his nwa action skinner said anybody who says 
that i did not keep the white house informed fully as to what was 
going on prior to making those decisions just isnt informed 
skinner said every step he took was thoroughly coordinated 
with senior white house officials he declined however to 
describe any conversations he had with other administration 
officials over his nwa action 
the secretary said his reservations about the united deal which 
was to be financed by banks and british airways prompted him to 
conduct a department review of the proposal but he gave no opinion 
at the time about its soundness 
i talked to leading scholars and accountants and management 
consultants who are experts in the airline industry and they all 
expressed reservations which just fortified my concerns skinner 
said adding that financial problems with the deal would increase 
safety and maintenance concerns 
the takeover bill has had strong bipartisan support passing the 
public works and transportation committee 235 a similar measure 
passed the senate commerce science and transportation committee 
but has not come up on the senate floor 
the takeover legislation was prompted by the united and 
northwest deals and the aborted attempt by developer donald trump 
to buy amr corp parent company of american airlines the decline 
in the stock market led trump to withdraw his 75 billion plan 
which was opposed by amr management

united airlines pilots are going back to the 
bargaining table and threatening to ground the carriers newest 
jetliners 
having failed in their bid to lead an employee buyout of united 
parent ual corp the pilots say the contract concessions they 
agreed to as a part of that effort including flying uniteds new 
747400 aircraft will expire nov 22 
unless they get a new contract by then the pilots say theyll 
stop flying those planes forcing united to substitute smaller jets 
on daily roundtrip flights between los angeles and sydney and 
melbourne australia 
well be exactly where we were in the prebuyout 
environment said hank krakowski a spokesman for the united 
chapter of the air line pilots association 
the pilots agreed to fly the planes beginning sept 18 ending a 
dispute over the size of the cockpit crew that had kept the planes 
grounded since june 
krakowski said the pilots and ual resumed negotiations monday on 
a contract to succeed a pact that expired in april 1988 
also on monday the union representing uniteds flight 
attendants said it had been contacted by california billionaire 
marvin davis who first put chicagobased ual into play in august 
a published report said davis has also talked with the airlines 
pilots and machinists with an eye toward reentering the fight for 
ownership of the nations secondlargest carrier 
uniteds stock rose 4 a share to 175 monday on the new york 
stock exchange 
united pilots agreed to fly the 747400s and to increase their 
workload to 85 flighthours a month from 81 with no additional pay 
effective nov 1 as a show of good faith in their bid to 
participate in an employeemanagement buyout of ual for 675 
billion 
the deal which also included minority participation by uals 
top management and british airways plc collapsed oct 13 when the 
group failed to secure financing for their 300ashare bid 
british airways has since dropped out and uniteds flight 
attendants have signed on to the group which hopes to make a 
revised offer for ual 
had the buyout gone through the pilots also had agreed to 
accept a 7year contract requiring a 10 percent pay cut 
ual spokeswoman sara dornacker declined comment on whether 
grounding the 747400s would disrupt united service between los 
angeles and australia she said the airline had flown the route 
using smaller 747sps from early 1986 until last month when united 
put two 747400s into service 
we have the ability to substitute one aircraft for another on 
any given route ms dornacker said 
the technologically superior 400s can carry 392 passengers 
compared with 247 in the sps and have a 33 percent larger cargo 
capacity she said 
davis contacted the united chapter of the association of flight 
attendants on friday said afa spokeswoman patricia friend she 
would not comment on the nature of the call 
the los angeles times reported on saturday that davis adviser 
david batchelder had discussed a potential ual buyout offer with 
the pilots the flight attendants and the international association 
of machinists and aerospace workers which represents uniteds 
mechanics and ground crews 
krakowski said he did not know if the pilots had been contacted 
by davis and the machinists did not return telephone calls seeking 
to confirm the times report 
davis office in los angeles also did not return calls 
the machinists opposition to employee ownership was seen as one 
factor in the failure of the pilotmanagement bid for ual analysts 
say the cooperation of and concessions from the unions are critical 
for any succesful buyout of the airline

columbia pictures entertainment inc by japans sony corp for 34 
billion it also continues a trend of major japanese real estate 
purchases in the united states 
rockefeller group inc which owns and manages the 19building 
rockefeller center complex in manhattan is a legacy of a family 
whose name stands for american capitalism the family which 
controls the private company traces its fortune to john d 
rockefeller who founded the standard oil co 
managers of trusts that control the familys holdings said they 
decided to sell 51 percent of their shares in rockefeller group to 
diversify the companys investments which also include the 
nationwide cushman amp wakefield commercial real estate brokerage 
last month rockefeller group confirmed media reports that it 
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company the 
reports indicated that some rockefeller family members wanted more 
income from their investments most of the family members 
inheritance is tied up in real estate and other holdings 
but the independent trust committee that manages the familys 
holdings said monday the money from the sale to mitsubishi would be 
reinvested in other rockefeller group operations and would not be 
paid out to family members 
william g bowen chairman of the trust committee said one 
objective of the sale was to diversify the companys holdings 
which are concentrated in real estate 
the sale of a large block of shares to mitsubishi was approved 
because it offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the 
longterm prospects of the rockefeller group and rockefeller center 
while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolio bowen said 
in a statement david rockefeller rockefeller groups chairman 
and son of john d rockfeller jr said our agreement with 
mitsubishi estate preserves the abiding commitment to rockefeller 
center and new york city which my father made more than 50 years 
ago and which present generations of the family continue to feel 
rockefeller group officials said the companys board its 
advisers and the trust committee considered other options such as 
a recapitalization funded by debt before they decided on the stock 
sale the closing date of the deal was not announced 
four years ago rockefeller group refinanced rockefeller center 
by taking out a 13 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space 
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real 
estate investment trust 
in the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those 
shares into ownership stakes in rockefeller center that would put 
715 percent of the complex in the publics hands 
the rockefeller family fortune was was estimated at 900 million 
in 1911 when the standard oil trust was busted into several 
companies today forbes magazine estimates the combined family 
fortune at over 5 billion 
john d rockefellers son john d rockefeller jr created five 
trusts for his children in 1934 those trusts are the principal 
owners of rockefeller group with descendants of john d 
rockefeller jr the main beneficiaries 
the 22acre rockefeller center complex includes the 65story 
general electric building formerly called the rca building which 
contains the rainbow room and nbcs headquarters radio city music 
hall home of the rockettes a famed outdoor iceskating rink the 
timelife building and the associated press building headquarters 
of the news service 
the art deco center built in the 1930s is one of the nations 
first largescale urban developments its buildings are the home of 
many wellknown corporations such as timewarner inc mcgrawhill 
inc and morgan stanley amp co inc 
rockefeller groups other businesses include rockefeller center 
development corp rockefeller center management corp rockefeller 
group telecommunications services inc radio city music hall 
productions inc and the 40office cushman amp wakefield in which 
the company holds an 80 percent stake

ties to the auto company of the same name is one of japans

whose name stands for american capitalism the family which 
controls the private company traces its fortune to john d 
rockefeller who founded the standard oil co 
the old 12building art deco portion of rockefeller center 
including radio city music hall most likely will not be controlled 
by mitsubishi past the year 2000 public shareholders of a real 
estate investment trust are expected to take control that year

year 2000 
four years ago rockefeller group refinanced rockefeller center 
by taking out a 13 billion mortgage on the historic portion of 
the center east of avenue of the americas it then sold shares in 
that mortgage to the public through a real estate investment trust 
in the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those 
shares into ownership stakes in the older portion of rockefeller 
center that would put 715 percent of the complex in the publics 
hands 
conversion of the shares appears likely because the properties 
involved in the trust already are worth 18 billion according to 
an appraisal at the end of last year 
the conversion would leave just 285 percent of the older 
portion of rockefeller center under the joint ownership of 
mitsubishi estate and the rockefellers 
the rockefeller family fortune was estimated at 900 million in 
1911 when the standard oil trust was busted into several 
companies today forbes magazine estimates the combined family 
fortune at over 5 billion 
john d rockefellers son john d rockefeller jr created five 
trusts for his children in 1934 those trusts are the principal 
owners of rockefeller group with descendants of john d 
rockefeller jr the main beneficiaries 
the 22acre rockefeller center complex includes the 65story 
general electric building formerly called the rca building which 
contains the rainbow room and nbcs headquarters radio city music 
hall home of the rockettes a famed outdoor iceskating rink the 
timelife building and the associated press building headquarters 
of the news service 
the original part of the center was built in the 1930s in an art 
deco style as one of the nations first largescale urban 
developments and is classified as a national historic landmark the 
center was later expanded with a row of modern skyscrapers west of 
avenue of the americas 
its buildings are the home of many wellknown corporations such 
as time warner inc mcgrawhill inc and morgan stanley amp co inc 
among the newer buildings the exxon building was sold about three 
years ago to japans mitsui amp co for 620 million and is now being 
vacated by exxon which is moving headquarters to texas the 
celanese building is owned by jmb realty of chicago and the 
mcgrawhill building is halfowned by mcgrawhill

georgia pacific corp said today that it 
offered to acquire great northern nekoosa corp in a cash deal that 
values the company at around 313 billion 
the 58ashare bid confirms several days of market rumors that 
georgiapacific a forest products company based in atlanta would 
attempt to take over great northern a norwalk conn paper 
products company 
georgia pacific said its bid represented a 50 percent premium 
over the market price of great northern before takeover speculation 
drove up the stocks price starting last thursday 
nekoosa closed up 275 at 4275 in active new york stock 
exchange trading monday george pacific fell 12 cents to 5337 a 
share 
in a letter delivered today to great northern chairman william 
r laidig georgia pacific chairman t marshall hahn jr emphasized 
his desire to achieve a friendly negotiated merger and requested a 
meeting with laidig as soon as possible 
unlike many of todays transactions driven by financial 
engineering the merger of our two companies represents an 
excellent strategic fit based on industrial logic hahn said 
this combination will result in a stronger and more competitive 
forest products company 
laidig in a news release said the offer was uninvited but 
would be considered along with the request to negotiate a merger 
in due course by the board of directors 
mark kurland an analyst with mabon nugent amp co in new york 
said the offer probably could trigger bids from other forest 
products companies including champion international co 
international paper corp weyerhauser co and canadas 
abitibiprice inc 
im sure they have calls in to great northern right now 
said kurland who expected great northern would attempt to secure 
the best price for its shareholders if it could not fend off a 
takeover attempt by georgia pacific 
kurland said he would not be surprised if great northern pursued 
a friendly merger with champion or boise cascade corp in order to 
avoid an unwanted takeover 
great northern would be an attractive acquisition for georgia 
pacific because it would allow the company to acquire 7 percent of 
both the linerboard and white paper markets in the united states 
without having to build its own operations kurland said 
great northern has been expanding its facilities on monday it 
announced it was acquiring a 50 percent interest in a linerboard 
mill in oklahoma two years ago it bought a paper and box 
production unit from owensillinois inc for 15 billion 
but kurland said he was surprised georgia pacifics bid came 
now during a downward cycle in the paper products industry he 
attributed to a general economic slowdown and expansions in the 
paper industry 
georgia pacific said it was offering 58 a share in cash for 
each of great northerns approximately 54 million shares 
outstanding making the company worth around 313 billion 
however it said it would cost approximately 45 billion to 
consummate the offer including refinancing certain indebtedness 
of great northern and georgia pacific and pay related fees and 
expenses 
the company said the deal was conditioned on among other 
things acquiring at least 75 percent of great northerns 
outstanding shares by nov 29

the chairman of a house panel investigating 
cereal makers health claims said today that pressure from the 
office of management and budget on federal regulators has allowed 
food manufacturers to lie about the benefits of eating their 
products 
based on all the evidence the subcommittee has uncovered in 
this an other investigations i am concerned that the agency 
empowered by congress to make the federal governments health 
policy is not performing that function said rep ted weiss 
dny chairman of the house government operations subcommittee on 
human resources and intergovernmental relations 
instead an ideologically driven omb has seized the controls 
of the health policy ship he said 
weiss said the food and drug administration proposed in 1987 
that explicit diseaseprevention claims be allowed on food labels 
he said that under omb pressure the fda bypassed the normal 
regulatory rules and allowed companies to begin making the health 
claims immediately 
the 1987 proposal has seriously weakened fdas ability to 
challenge even what the agency itself believes are deceptive 
claims weiss said as he opened a hearing on the subject 
interviewed earlier on nbctvs today show weiss said 
manufacturers are playing reckless games with the publics 
health with their claims 
the fda said recently it had serious concerns about cereals that 
contain husks of psyllium which contains soluable fiber 
manufacturers say the grain is safe and can help lower cholesterol 
last month the fda told general mills maker of benefit cereal 
and kellogg co maker of heartwise and bran buds to submit 
scientific data to the agency showing that the levels of the grain 
in their products is safe 
benefit also contains sugar beet fiber and the fda asked general 
mills to submit data showing it also is safe 
the cereal makers contend that their products are safe and that 
they would submit the requested data 
bran buds has been on the market for a year benefit is being 
sold in selected test markets but heartwise is not on the market 
yet 
the issue of whether psyllium is a drug or a food additive was 
raised by procter amp gamble co which uses psyllium in its 
metamucil laxative the company had asked the fda to pull benefit 
off the market because the cereal had not been subjected to 
drugtesting requirements 
in letters to general mills and kellogg the fda said there are 
wellknown safety concerns associated with use of psyllium 
including possible allergic reactions 
the agency noted that general mills has warned on its label 
about this possibility provides instructions for its use on the 
package label and advises consuming the cereal with adequate 
liquids and restricting consumption by children 
but the fda also said that unlike a drug product a food is 
subject to unrestricted consumption and such unrestricted use to 
reduce serum cholesterol levels or for any other purpose has never 
been approved by fda

soybean futures prices were slightly higher while 
the grain markets were narrowly mixed in early trading today on the 
chicago board of trade

largerthanexpected number of delivery notices posted this morning 
against the november contract 
today is the firstnotice day for the november soybean contract 
the first opportunity for traders to declare their intentions to 
actually deliver soybeans when the contract expires next month 
the corn markets weakness was seen partly as a reaction to an 
unexpectedly low export inspection figure in a weekly agriculture 
department report the usda said monday it inspected about 347 
million bushels of corn for export last week compared to 333 
million a week earler and 31 million a year ago

were 79 percent complete as of sunday

higher with the december contract at 396 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent lower with december at 240 a bushel oats 
were cent higher across the board with december at 143 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with november at 
562 a bushel

usx corp tuesday said its thirdquarter 
earnings declined 23 percent to 175 million or 62 cents per 
share with operating income falling nearly 14 percent due largely 
to asset sales 
quarterly sales grew slightly to 44 billion from 42 billion 
a year earlier when net income was 228 million or 80 cents per 
share earnings in the 1988 quarter were boosted by a 71 million 
gain on a federal tax issue 
the energy and steel company said operating income soared 104 
million to 84 million at the exploration and production end of its 
marathon oil co subsidiary while operating income plunged 84 
million or 75 percent to 112 million at marathons refining 
marketing and transportation operations 
upstream operations benefited from higher prices downstream 
operations were hurt by lower refined product margins usx said 
overall operating income was 302 million compared with 350 
million in the 1988 third quarter 
operating income in steel fell 105 percent from 95 million on 
sales of 14 billion to 85 million on sales of 13 billion usx 
attributed the decline to the sale of its lorain ohio plant to a 
joint venture with kobe steel ltd of japan 
steels performance remained favorable despite weakness in the 
market for oil country tubular goods and moderate declines in 
demand in other steel markets the company said 
ninemonth net earnings rose 205 percent to 721 million or 
262 per share on sales of 138 billion from 598 million or 
207 per share on sales of 125 billion 
the improvement resulted primarily from better results in the 
energy segment where operating income was more than twice the 1988 
level said chairman charles a corry 
asset sales contributed 312 million to total pretax income of 
11 billion in the period he said 
usx said in october it is soliciting bids for its texas oil amp 
gas corp subsidiary where a thirdquarter operating loss of 9 
million represented an improvement of 6 million

the white house and congressional leaders 
today agreed to raise the minimum wage to 425 an hour by april 
1991 ending a lengthy political stalemate and clearing the way for 
the first boost in the base wage since 1981 
both sides made significant concessions to reach the deal which 
for the first time would create a subminimum wage for teenagers 
with little or no job experience 
the compromise was struck between white house chief of staff 
john sununu and house speaker thomas foley dwash other lawmakers 
who have in the past been involved in the issue agreed to it 
although some complained of being kept out of the discussions 
one last langauge problem was being worked out but all sides 
said the compromise measure would be drafted today and put to a 
house vote wednesday senate approval likely would follow rapidly 
no side will get the victory for this said rep augustus 
hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education and labor 
committee hawkins the house author of a 455 minimumwage bill 
president bush vetoed earlier this year said he was not involved 
in the talks that led to the deal 
rep austin murphy dpa author of the latest democratic 
proposal said he would reluctantly support the compromise 
i think we could have done a little better if wed held their 
feet to the fire he said 
the deal was reached even as bush told a morning news conference 
he would again veto the democratic bill if it was not changed to 
meet his standards 
ill send it right back he said 
but a short time later the compromise was presented to the 
house rules committee as a bipartisan substitute for the murphy 
bill set for debate in the house on wednesday the agreement ends a 
nearly nineyear fight by the democratic congressional leadership 
and organized labor against the reagan administration and now the 
bush administration 
the movement came only a day after democrats and republicans 
alike complained that the administration was showing no willingness 
to compromise and that another vetooverride battle was likely 
the compromise would boost the minimum wage from 335 an hour 
to 380 an hour on april 1 1990 with a second 45cent increase 
coming a year later that would bring the minimum wage to 425 in 
1991 nine months earlier than bush originally proposed and three 
months later than called for in the current democratic bill 
the issue that has been the greatest obstacle to agreement was 
the language for a socalled training wage under which newly hired 
workers could be paid a subminimum 
democratic leaders wanted such a provision to cover only new 
entrants in the job market and only then for 60 days bush had 
insisted on a sixmonth provision that would cover all workers each 
time they changed jobs 
both sides gave some on that issue to reach the apparent 
compromise 
the administration had agreed to a twotiered subminimum of an 
intial three months and then an additional three months if the 
employer could document actual training 
the language concerning the second three months was unresolved 
early this afternoon but was expected to be worked out by days end 
the subminimum provision would cover only workers 16 to 19 years 
old and would expire in 1993 unless congress endorsed it again 
the administration agreed to the expiration of the subminimum in 
exchange for democrats dropping their insistence for a commission 
to report annually on the minimum wage republicans contended the 
panel would be used by democrats to in effect seek annual 
increases 
democratic leaders and organized labor initially had opposed any 
training wage but were forced to give in because conservative 
democrats who helped bush win the veto fight sided with the 
president on that issue 
advocates of the subminimum say it will prevent massive job 
losses among youths that they say would be triggered by a higher 
minimum wage the final target of 425 is also below the 455 
contained in the bill bush vetoed and is lower still than the 525 
an hour originally proposed by hawkins last year

kimberlyclark corp tuesday reported a 202 
percent jump in third quarter income mainly from increased prices 
and sales of disposable diapers and feminine care products 
kimberlyclark said earnings in the three months ended sept 30 
were 1088 million or 135 per share compared with 905 
million or 112 per share in the comparable quarter of last year 
sales grew 62 percent to 145 billion this year from 137 
billion last year 
the quarterly improvement also was helped by a 11 million 
charge last year to cover early retirement and other costs 
associated with a modernization program at a pulp and newsprint 
plant in alabama 
net income in the ninemonth period was 3132 million or 389 
per share compared with 2839 million or 353 per share sales 
in the period rose to 427 billion from 4 billion 
the consumer business improvements generally were due to 
higher selling prices particularly for disposable diapers and 
tissue products and from increased sales volumes especially for 
feminine care products the company said 
while consumer product income was up the company said its 
newsprint business remains depressed because of industrywide price 
discounting 
dallasbased kimberlyclark markets household personal care and 
health care products under such brands as kleenex tissues kotex 
and new freedom feminine products and huggies disposable diapers

the bush administration would abandon its 
proposed capitalgains tax cut if faced with the threat of the 
governments defaulting on its loans a treasury department 
official said today 
if it were literally a choice between capital gains and 
default obviously treasury would not allow default 
undersecretary robert r glauber told a house ways and means 
subcommittee 
glauber responded only after considerable prodding by democratic 
members of the oversight subcommittee they fear that efforts by 
senate republicans to add a capitalgains cut to a bill extending 
the governments borrowing authority could jeopardize that bill and 
push the government toward default next week 
meantime president bush told a news conference i plan to 
fight for my position favoring a capitalgains tax cut its 
something thats good for growth investment jobs he said 
capital gains are profits from the sales of investments such as 
real estate and securities they now are taxed at the same rate as 
other income a housepassed bill which bush endorses woould 
create a lower rate for capital gains for 2 years and then 
permanently adjust the tax system so that gains caused solely by 
inflation were not taxed 
capital gains has become the dominant issue before congress 
bushs push for the tax cut against opposition of democratic 
leaders has blocked action on a 16 billion deficitreduction bill 
on legislation to boost aid to poland and hungary and on the 
measure raising the governments debt ceiling 
democrats say bush and his republican allies should be pressing 
for passage of a debtceiling bill without any amendment and 
especially without the capitalgains amendment republicans are 
unwilling to let that bill pass unamended because they view it as 
the best way to win the capitalgains reduction 
if that stalemate continues past nov 7 the government would be 
faced with the possibility of defaulting on its credit for the 
first time in history 
glauber was asked repeatedly whether the administration would 
ask congress for an unamended debtceiling bill the secretary 
will recommend to the president that he sign a clean unamended 
debt bill he responded but he would not say that the 
administration would recommend passage of an unamended measure 
the house has passed a capitalgains tax cut as part of its plan 
for reducing the budget deficit rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee has promised that 
the capitalgains cut and all other extraneous provision will be 
removed from that bill if the senate will pass an unamended 
debtceiling bill 
but rostenkowski emphasized today that if they senators are 
going to load up that debt bill will amendments that would 
greatly diminish chances of getting a deficitreduction bill this 
year

mitsubishi estate co the company buying a 
majority stake in the owner of manhattans famed rockefeller 
center is not a sony or anything like it 
sony corp the consumer electronics manufacturer that is buying 
columbia pictures for 34 billion is seen in japan as a brash 
innovative upstart 
mitsubishi estate is an aristocratic collector of rents that 
belongs to the mitsubishi group considered a grand rather gray 
old lady among japanese business circles 
the companys planned 846 million investment in the symbolic 
heart of manhattan was characterized by analysts on tuesday as an 
attempt to branch out from mitsubishis conservative base 
although the companys profitability is high it trails other 
japanese property firms in overseas investment and overall growth 
for its new york foray mitsubishi sought an equally prestigious 
partner as brand names are important to the japanese tourists 
mobbing the boutiques at rockefeller center the same holds for 
companies like mitsubishi 
they were looking for a toptier name tadashi kato an 
analyst at prudential bache securities said 
japanese stock market investors dont know much about 
privatelyheld rockefeller group except the name but mitsubishi 
stock closed up 150 points at 2680 yen tuesday on the tokyo stock 
exchange after the deal was announced 
the mitsubishi name rings of 19thcentury oligarchs wartime 
tycoons and the postwar governmentbusiness establishment 
mitsubishi managers are known as quintessential organization men 
in a country of organization men its bluesuited employees 
traditionally have been considered the cream of the elite the kind 
of solid wellheeled men people want their daughters to marry a 
far cry from some of the japanese real estate wheelerdealers 
famous in the united states but infamous at home 
the rockefeller and mitsubishi empires began as products of the 
same era the robberbaron days of the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries yataro iwasaki started the mitsubishi fortune in 
shipbuilding john d rockefeller in oil with japans wartime 
expansion mitsubishi grew into one of japans leading 
zaibatsu or business combines 
both empires fell victim to trustbusting mitsubishis 
209company combine was broken up and family influence virtually 
eliminated in the postwar dissolution of the zaibatsu by the 
occupying americans 
mitsubishi group no longer is controlled by a single holding 
company but its 41 companies maintain relations through a system 
of crossshareholding known as keiretsu companies operate 
independently and often compete against each other but in times of 
need all know they can depend on mitsubishi bank for help 
mitsubishi trust owns 73 percent of mitsubishi estate and 
mitsubishi bank owns 41 percent 
group companies produce everything from gasoline to chemicals 
steel automobiles paper electronic equipment weapons and 
aircraft with a trading company buying and selling worldwide 
mitsubishi estate is seen as a gentlemanly company in a 
business that in japan is seen as ungentlemanly says james 
doherty analyst at jardine fleming securities 
the company owns much of tokyos equivalent of rockefeller 
center and midtown manhattan the prestigious marunouchi business 
district next to the imperial palace a stones throw from the 
glittering ginza 
sitting on the most valuable contiguous piece of real estate in 
the world mitsubishi collects rents at less than half market value 
and still is the most profitable real estate company in japan 
analysts say 
mitsubishi says it has the largest portfolio of office buildings 
in japan 25 million square feet with a book value of more than 5 
billion jardine fleming estimated the real value at well over 70 
billion at the beginning of 1988 
but the long history of its marunouchi property which 
mitsubishi originally recovered from swampland on imperial orders 
in the 19th century is part of its problem 
its like its this big diamond just sitting there says 
alan woodhull analyst at merrill lynch 
city regulations forbid mitsubishi from tearing down existing 
midrise buildings in marunouchi for more efficient highrises the 
company cant raise rents of longterm tenants to market levels in 
part because of legal restrictions in part because some of those 
tenants are mitsubishi group companies 
mitsubishi still hopes to get permission to redevelop 
marunouchi meanwhile it has started a huge reclaimed land project 
in tokyo bay off yokohama where it is building japans tallest 
skyscraper 
overseas it plans to expand business that has lagged far behind 
other japanese companies mitsubishi has invested only 5 percent of 
its assets outside japan the company says 
mitsubishis overseas holdings include the 777 tower building in 
los angeles citicorp plaza and a 1000acre sunrise resort project 
in palm desert calif 
analysts say mitsubishi is likely to take a handsoff approach 
to its 51 percent share in the rockefeller group which includes 
the management of the rockefeller center development corp the 
cushman and wakefield real estate firm and radio city music hall 
productions 
a company like mitsubishi doesnt mind low yields if they 
dont get a quick return that wouldnt faze them at all said 
doherty

irving azoff one of the most powerful and 
highly regarded executives in the music business said tuesday he 
was forming his own label in a joint venture with warner bros 
records the leading us record company

clashes with top mca management

to be based in los angeles will open jan 1 
azoff and warner bros records board chairman mo ostin said 
specifics about staff and artists were expected to be announced 
soon

producer david geffen for whose geffenroberts personal management 
firm azoff once worked handling the careers of crosby stills 
nash amp young joni mitchell and neil young

and told the associated press when he resigned at mca that he would 
not be a minority partner in any deal 
financial terms of the warner deal were not announced although 
warner bros was to manufacture and distribute recordings 
domestically and through its wea international in the rest of the 
world 
what i want to do is a broadbased company the cornerstone of 
which will be a record company azoff had said basically i 
intend to start the first major independent of the 90s with major 
funding 
azoff drew notice for his deft handling of the careers of such 
rock superstars as the eagles boz scaggs and steely dan but he 
left all that in april 1983 to join mca a company he once 
characterized as the music cemetery of america 
mca dropped 41 of its 46 acts and started rebuilding often 
signing other labels discards elton john for example had his 
career rejuvenated when he returned to mca and azoff broadened the 
labels base beyond rock and jazz into black music and contemporary 
country 
for the 1982 fiscal year mcas recording and musicpublishing 
operations had 1417 million in gross revenue for fiscal 1988 
the music entertainment group which includes homevideo revenues

mcas music group lost more than 8 million in 1983 but earned 
more than 60 million last year in the same period units shipped 
rose from 35 million to 120 million 
a proxy statement shows azoff was paid about 5 million in 
salary and stock last year 
mca had hoped to negotiate its own similar deal with azoff mca 
president and chief operating officer sid sheinberg did not 
immediately return a call seeking comment on the warnerazoff deal 
azoff was succeeded as chairman of mca music by al teller a 
former cbs records president who joined mca last year as a

offsetting the news about a weakening economy is 
some news of another sort that has surprised some economists they 
are wondering if it is too good to persist inflation is declining 
this may not be news to savvy consumers who have grabbed 
bargains at retail outlets of various sorts in automobile 
showrooms and grocery stores for example in recent weeks their 
knowledge of prices is immediate 
for economists who rely on statistics however the recognition 
is a bit delayed and some of them are just now expressing their 
happiness in contrast only a few weeks ago they had thought 
inflation was gaining momentum 
so widespread was that fear during early summer that the federal 
reserve persisted in a tightmoney policy at one point earlier 
this year there wer indications of a 6 percent to 9 percent 
inflation rate 
over the summer however rates decelerated sharply especially 
for food and energy the very items that had earlier caused alarm 
transportation automobile gasoline and housing costs also fell 
significantly 
the deceleration and in some instances actual declines in 
prices still leaves some economists a bit puzzled wondering if 
some pieces of the puzzle still need to be fitted into place they 
wait to see if it will continue 
allen sinai economist for the boston co observes that 
disinflation at retail is surprising in an economy that grew 25 
percent in the second quarter and probably 3 percentplus in the 
third quarter 
he is among those who tend to suspend judgment about the 
permanence of the change saying the puzzle of the rapid 
disinflation could well disappear in coming months with another 
acceleration that said he attempts to explain 
first he calls attention to a weakening manufacturing sector 
accompanied by efforts to contain costs especially in labor with 
revenue growth slowing sinai says manufacturers are forced to 
stay pricecompetitive 
this is not the usual reaction of american business he 
observes contending that typically prices are held high to 
maintain profit margins and labor costs are cut much later 
he suggests also that the economy may be weaker than the 
official data suggest compelling retailers to offer more discounts 
than usual and adding to the pressure to hold prices he says is 
intense competition from abroad 
other esoteric explanations are offered in abundance but 
probably come no nearer to explaining the surprisingly good price 
performance more important are the conclusions drawn and sinai 
sees the possibility of even lower rates 
looking into 1990 he talks of an inflation rate as low as 35 
percent to 4 percent or about a full percentage point lower than 
the surprisingly low rates that now exist 
there is a price to pay of course there always is and that 
according to sinai might be a significant economic downturn 
still if youre going to have a slowdown let it be accompanied 
by stable or lower prices you may recall that over the past decade 
or so it was demonstrated that the economy can fall while prices 
rise 
if the country is going to have an economic slowdown that is 
let it be accompanied by some good news too and what better news 
can there be than an extended breather from rising prices

wall street brokers said in addition the market had reacted

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed 
mostly lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade ending an 
uneventful session of listless trading 
early strength in the soybean market faded during the morning 
and trading in the soybean pit was nearly at a standstill in the 
afternoon as players waited in vain for significant news on which 
to trade 
in a report issued late monday the agriculture department said 
the us corn and soybean harvests were each 79 percent complete as 
of sunday 
in followup comments tuesday the usda said corn harvesting was 
lagging behind the normal pace in the eastern half of the corn 
belt while the soybean harvest had progressed more quickly than 
normal except in the eastern corn belt and the southeast 
the agency said soybean harvesting was finished in south dakota 
and nearly complete in illiois iowa and nebraska

the british government said tuesday it would drop 
its golden share power to veto any takeover of jaguar plc if 
the luxury car makers shareholders approved such a move possibly 
clearing the way for a bidding war 
the decision which surprised jaguar would allow for general 
motors corp ford motor co or other potential suitors to make 
proposals to jaguar shareholders 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said in the house of commons 
that the government would relinquish its veto power if jaguar 
shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to lift a restriction 
limiting individual jaguar holdings to 15 percent of the company 
this statement paves the way for shareholders with the advice 
of the board to reach their own view on the options which may be 
available ridley said 
the golden share veto power and the 15 percent limit are due 
to expire at the end of 1990 
however jaguars articles of association still prevent anyone 
from owning more than 15 percent of jaguar without approval by 
shareholders at an extraordinary meeting the company noted 
jaguars shares soared finishing up the equivalent of 193 at 
1373 a share on londons stock exchange 
jaguar which has suffered from slumping us sales is looking 
for a partner to give it financial and technological support but 
wants to remain independent 
analysts estimate the luxury car maker could fetch up to 1580 
a share or 28 billion if gm and ford engage in a bidding war 
for jaguar 
general motors and jaguar have been holding friendly talks for 
months in an effort to reach a cooperation agreement which is 
expected to be announced by midnovember 
general motors is expected to take a minority stake in jaguar 
and run several joint ventures including the manufacture of a new 
cheaper jaguar model 
we will now consider all our options and explore matters 
further in light of these important new developments said gm 
spokesman jack harned in detroit 
ford has acquired a 132 percent stake in jaguar and said it is 
prepared to mount a buyout bid once the takeover restrictions are 
dropped ford spokesman rex greenslade in dearborn mich said the 
company had no comment tuesday on jaguar 
jaguar said it was surprised by the announcement and had not 
been consulted in advance about ridleys move 
it was of course always the jaguar boards intention that 
any proposals concerning the future of the company would be 
submitted for shareholder approval the statement read 
either the jaguar board or a shareholder owning at least 10 
percent of the company may call an extraordinary meeting said 
jaguar spokesman arnold bolton 
during his speech in commons ridley said the governments 
remaining role would be to assess the impact a takeover of jaguar 
might have on competition in the british auto industry 
i am clear that it is in the best interests of jaguars 
management shareholders and work force for the companys future to 
be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as 
quickly as possible he said 
the restrictions were established in 1984 when the government 
sold the car maker they were intended to protect jaguars 
independence during its formative years ridley said 
now the restrictions are clearly causing uncertainties about 
the companys future by prompting speculation over how my powers 
may be exercised so distorting the basis on which all parties 
involved have to reach their decisions ridley said 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government 
champions freemarket policies and generally has not exercised its 
golden shares 
for example british petroleum co plc acquired britoil plc last 
year after the government said it wouldnt use its takeover veto

the stock market staged a broadbased rally 
today triggered by news of a 3 billion takeover offer for great 
northern nekoosa corp 
the momentum began at the opening bell on news that georgia 
pacific corp had offered to acquire the norwalk connbased paper 
company and continued throughout the session 
wall street analysts said the tender offer helped renew investor 
confidence that had eroded after the collapse earlier this month of 
proposed deals involving ual corp and amr corp the failure of a 
ual pilotled group to get the necessary financing to buy the 
company helped trigger the midoctober stock plunge 
the paper offer was helpful because it shows that deals are 
still going to be done or at least are attempting to be done 
said brad weeks head of equity trading for donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette 
the markets ability to sustain the rally throughout the 
session however surprised many analysts who expected investor 
pessimism to return after the initial euphoria had worn off 
the tender offer helped revive paper stocks which had 
languished in recent months traders said 
new government data that suggested the pace of economic growth 
is slowing had little impact on the stock market 
the commerce department reported that the index of leading 
indicators its chief economic forecasting gauge inched ahead 02

the government also reported that sales of new homes fell 14 
percent in september their steepest decline in nearly eight years 
as interest rates crept back to the doubledigit level of the

analysts said the rally was orderly and pleasant without the 
violent swings brought on by program trading some brokerages in 
recent days announced that they were suspending index arbitrage

saudi arabian oil minister hisham 
nazer said tuesday his country is maintaining its opec quota and is 
committed to security for oil importing and exporting nations 
we cannot prosper without each other nazer said it is 
not only you that needs the oil it is also us who needs the 
markets 
nazer speaking to the independent petroleum association of 
america said his country is particularly interested in a healthy 
oil market in the united states which last year accounted for 
about onefourth of total oil imports 
we are now an integral part of the united states oil market 
and the return on our investment depends on its health nazer 
said onefifth of the oil supplied by saudi arabia the worlds 
largest oil exporter goes to the united states he said 
while independent or highcost lowreserve producers may 
be a declining part of the world oil market nazer said their role 
is significant 
their output and their continuing presence in the market is 
essential in a situation of robust demand and their presence 
becomes all the more important in times of excess demand which may 
well be the situation in the future he said 
later referring to independent producers in the united states 
he told reporters i think they should get all the incentives 
they need because i think their role in the market is extremely 
important 
asked about reports that saudi arabia is producing 54 million 
barrels of oil a day nazer replied we are sticking to our 
opec quota by the way there is a difference between production 
and quota 
he said his nations opec oil quota is 514 million barrels a 
day nazer also said saudi arabias oil reserves are estimated at 
252 billion barrels but could end up being as high as 315 billion 
barrels overall world reserves total 950 billion barrels nazer 
said 
nazer also said saudi arabia alone cannot stabilize the world 
oil market 
saudi arabia believes in reasonable and stable oil prices 
which allow appropriate returns to producers unreasonably high or 
unreasonably low prices give both producers and consumers 
misleading signals he said 
touting the notion of reciprocal security nazer said oil 
customers must know that the flow of oil and natural gas will 
continue at a reasonable price 
there is a need to enlarge the concept of energy security to 
cover not only the consumers but also the producers he said 
reciprocal security nazer said is a simple equation of oil 
supply and demand you need the oil we have the oil he said 
to a few chuckles in the audience 
nazer declined to discuss what actions the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries might take at an upcoming november 
meeting 
as for oil prices in the first quarter of 1990 he said i 
dont see how you can get lower prices with higher demand

irving azoff a musicbusiness wizard who 
revived mca records after deftly managing the careers of such stars 
as the eagles stevie nicks and crosby stills nash amp young said 
tuesday that warner bros records was setting him up as head of his 
own label 
on one level the creation of a new record concern bucks a trend 
of consolidation into a handful of huge conglomerates island and 
aampm were swallowed by dutchowned polygram rca records by 
germanys bertelsmann ag and motown by mca cbs records was 
acquired by sony corp and japans fujisankei communications also 
bought a 25 percent stake in virgin records 
everybody has been sold and bought azoff said in a 
telephone interview but rock n roll is a rebellious art form 
by nature and given the choice i think a real artist would rather 
be in business with an individual than a multinational 
on the other hand azoff will enjoy the advantages of warners 
huge size the company has about 40 percent of the us market 
and international distribution network 
you cant take an artist and say im going to be so 
independent that youre not going to be distributed by a major 
azoff said 
azoff who quit as head of mca records in september said warner 
will handle manufacturing and distribution and will fully fund the 
new recording and music publishing company he will own the company 
in a 5050 partnership with warner 
he declined to go into details about the deal but had estimated 
recently that it would take 75 million to 100 million to launch 
an independent record label 
mca had hoped to negotiate its own similar deal with azoff mca 
president and chief operating officer sid sheinberg did not 
immediately return a call seeking comment on the warners deal 
warner already has a 5050 deal with record and movie producer 
david geffen distributing recordings and movies from his 
independent company 
geffen is another powerful musicbusiness baron for whose 
geffenroberts personal management firm azoff once worked handling 
the careers of such artists as crosby stills nash amp young and 
joni mitchell 
no two deals are the same azoff said but my arrangement 
is similar in spirit to geffens 
a proxy statement shows mca paid azoff about 5 million in 
salary and stock last year he wouldnt discuss any guarantees in 
his new contract 
over the last two decades azoffs front line management had 
managed many acts who recorded for warner the company also had 
funded his full moon records in a joint venture and had handled 
foreign distribution for mca 
besides mca and warner several other companies had courted him 
i talked to several but all along i hoped it would be 
warner azoff said noting that warner has a long history of 
handling distribution in close relationships with independent 
labels such as asylum geffen sire virgin and island 
warner has played an instrumental role in launching all the 
independents he said no other american company can point to 
it and say that 
azoff spent 16 years as a personal manager then became head of 
mca records in 1983 he quit in september leaving behind a music 
group where earnings had gone from an 8 million loss in 1983 to a 
60 million profit in 1988 in the same period units shipped rose 
from 35 million to 120 million

takeover offer for great northern nekoosa corp 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 4160 points to 
finish at 264508 the bluechip indicator had declined in five 
straight sessions last week and recovered only slightly on monday 
wall street analysts said the 58ashare tender offer by 
georgia pacific corp for norwalk connbased paper maker great 
northern nekoosa helped restore market players confidence about 
the prospects for future dealmaking 
takeover speculation has helped buoy stock prices during the 
markets rise this year 
but wall streets confidence was shaken badly after the collapse 
earlier this month of proposed deals involving ual corp and amr 
corp the failure of a ual employeemanagement group to get 
financing for its planned 675 billion buyout of the company 
helped trigger the oct 13 stock plunge which in turn led to the 
scuttling of developer donald trumps 7 billion offer for amr 
the paper offer was helpful because it shows that deals are 
still going to be done or at least are attempting to be done

texas billionaire robert bass may want to buy 
revco ds inc for 925 million because he thinks the nations 
aging population will be spending more money in revco drug stores 
an analyst said tuesday 
bass leads a group of investors bidding for the privately held 
1900store chain which is the first big leveraged buyout to file 
for protection from creditors in us bankruptcy court 
the deal would add 260 million in debt to the books of a 
company that was plunged into bankruptcy court last year because it 
couldnt keep up with its existing debt payments it went private 
in a 13 billion leveraged buyout in 1986 
jeffrey stein of mcdonald amp co of cleveland said the offer 
reflected revcos prescription business which is about 30 percent 
of its sales and the increasing number of older americans more 
dependent on prescription drugs 
revcos stores in 27 states fill 65 million prescriptions yearly 
the company still has a strong franchise in the drugstore 
industry said stein 
revco spokeswoman diana lueptow declined to comment on merits of 
the bass bid saying not enough information was available she said 
the company technically considers it an expression of interest 
rather than an offer under chapter 11 revco itself has first 
rights until feb 28 to propose any reorganization plan for the 
company 
the bid was made in an oct 20 letter from acadia partners and 
the robert m bass group inc of fort worth texas and made public 
monday 
the 925 million figure overstates what the bassled group would 
actually put up for revco it would pay 150 million in cash for 
all stock in the reorganized company and assume responsibility for 
515 million of debt on revcos books it would also have the 
reorganized company borrow an additional 2605 million 
the bass organization has a policy that we dont discuss any 
business with the news media said a woman handling news 
inquiries at bass offices in fort worth she declined to identify 
herself 
acadia partners specializes in leveraged acquisitions and is 
capitalized in excess of 16 billion principal partners include 
the bass group american express co equitable life assurance 
society of the us and shearson lehman hutton inc 
robert bass whose holdings were valued at 16 billion in the 
latest forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals has interests in 
real estate finances and oil 
david schulte who advises revco creditors on bankruptcy issues 
and stuart hertzberg of detroit representing revco suppliers were 
unavailable for comment tuesday 
anac holding corp parent of revco ds inc reported a 
firstquarter loss sept 29 of 162 million compared with a 279 
million loss for the same period last year sales increased 24 
percent from 583 million to 597 million 
revco was hampered late last year by dwindling stocks amidst 
supplier concerns it is fully in stock and looking forward to 
the upcoming holiday season the company saidin a preview of 
revcos second quarter which ends in late november 
stein said that if bought at the right price revco could 
operate profitably because it currently operates at a profit before 
corporate debt payments are taken into account

pork belly futures prices soared the permitted daily limit of 2 
cents a pound tuesday on the chicago mercantile exchange in 
anticipation of further export sales of the meat which normally 
attracts little interest overseas 
on other futures markets livestock futures rose precious 
metals fell sharply stockindex futures rallied oil futures were 
mixed and grains and soybeans were mostly lower 
frozen pork bellies settled 19 cents to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in february at 556 cents a pound its 
highest settlement in nearly nine months 
a pork belly is the part of a hog from which bacon is made 
with tuesdays surge the market extended a rally that began in 
the second week of august after february bellies bottomed on aug 9 
at 383 cents a pound a record low relative to hog prices 
analysts linked the markets comeback from 18year lows to 
export demand for bellies from eastern bloc nations an unusual 
development apparently prompted by the depressed prices and the 
ready availability of us bellies 
yugoslavia was reported monday to have purchased 200 metric tons 
of bellies about two weeks ago and was rumored on tuesday to be 
shopping for up to 800 tons more 
pork bellies also are expected to be sent to poland as part of a 
us foodaid package and the soviet union is believed to have 
been pricing us bellies recently 
the fact that weve never had these sources of demand has 
given the market a new dimension said charles levitt senior 
livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
thomas morgan president of sterling research corp said the 
health concerns that have cut into domestic demand for bacon are 
secondary to survival for eastern european people 
although pork bellies are about 70 percent fat when you want 
to buy something with a lot of energy in it for cheap money pork 
bellies are it morgan said 
the belly rally helped lift hog futures while cattle futures 
rose in line with stronger spot markets morgan said 
live cattle settled unchanged to 45 cent higher with december 
at 7445 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 57 cent 
higher with november at 8312 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent to 
88 cent higher with december at 4657 cents a pound 
precious metal futures retreated on new yorks commodity 
exchange as players who had bought gold and silver during last 
weeks stockmarket slide took their profits and shifted dollars 
back into stocks the dow jones average of 30 industrials gained 
more than 41 points tuesday 
gold settled 320 lower across the board with december at 
37760 a troy ounce silver was 65 cents to 74 cents lower with 
december at 5218 a troy ounce 
as stocks rallied so did stockindex futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for december delivery of 
stocks in the standard amp poors 500 index settled 595 points 
higher at 34315 the contract is worth 500 a point 
heatingoil futures surged on the new york mercantile exchange 
as cold weather moved into the midwest and headed for the 
northeast crude oil rose slightly and gasoline futures were mixed 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 22 cents 
higher with november at 1849 a barrel heating oil was 47 cent 
to 113 cents higher with november at 5864 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 10 cent lower to 35 cent higher with 
december at 5294 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower in listless trading 
on the chicago board of trade 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 
394 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with december

eastern airlines submitted its revised 
reorganization plan to creditors on tuesday after the creditors 
committee dropped plans to develop alternatives to the companys 
own plan 
joel zweibel a new york attorney representing the unsecured 
creditors committee said eastern sent copies of the plan to the 
creditors who will study it and meet next tuesday to vote the 
plan details easterns proposals for repaying its debts after it 
emerges from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that protects it 
from creditors 
zweibel wouldnt comment on mondays creditors committee 
meeting in new york 
other sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
16member committee voted to rescind instructions given at an oct 
18 meeting for its financial experts to develop alternative 
proposals the committee includes representatives of four eastern 
employees groups 
the new york times quoting two unidentified sources reported 
in tuesdays editions that creditors are near agreement on 
accepting easterns revised plan but a striking union official 
noted that negotiations are continuing 
im not sure theres been a change of heart said skip orr 
spokesman for easterns striking pilots what weve seen that i 
think is most significant is that there hasnt been an agreement 
and the parties are still negotiating 
an eastern spokeswoman said the company was upbeat about the 
negotiations although it couldnt comment in detail 
were pleased with the progress being made with the creditors 
committee but were not in a position to comment beyond that 
karen ceremsak said 
eastern on wednesday will add 75 flights bringing its daily 
schedule to 775 flights compared with nearly 1100 before the 
strike began 
some creditors have expressed concern that easterns effort to 
rebuild without its unions who walked out on march 4 wouldnt 
generate enough revenue to pay its debts 
but the times reported that one source said the creditors who 
have been lobbied intensely by texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo and eastern president phil bakes now believe they have a 
good chance of being repaid under easterns plan eastern debts 
total some 31 billion with more than 2 billion in longterm 
debt 
houstonbased texas air is the parent of eastern 
the one thing that we have not seen come out is any refuting 
of the figures that were presented two weeks ago said orr the 
pilots spokesman those were the figures that gave the creditors 
a great deal of concern 
the creditors advisers goldman sachs amp co and ernst amp young 
had reported that their analysis of easterns rebuilding plan 
showed the company would still be losing money over the next few 
years and goldman sachs said eastern would have to borrow more 
money to pay rebuilding costs 
eastern officials last april announced plans to rebuild to a 
regional carrier about 65 percent its prestrike size but lorenzo 
and bakes said recently that easterns rebuilding is moving faster 
than expected and they expect to return to 85 percent to 90 percent 
of prestrike operations with 1000 daily flights they say eastern 
can start making profits in 1990 and would have little debt left by 
the end of 1993 
they dropped plans to sell easterns south american routes 
expected to raise about 400 million in cash eastern did sell its 
northeast shuttle service to new york developer donald trump some 
philadelphia property and canadian routes to midway airlines and 
made several other sales of planes gates and landing rights to 
other buyers 
soon after eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on march 9 
some creditors indicated a preference for liquidation of the 
carrier to pay debts but us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
has made it clear he wants eastern revived 
the senate last week approved a bill calling for a senatehouse 
commission to investigate and make recommendations about how to 
resolve easterns labor dispute the bill goes to a conference 
committee to combine it with a similar house bill but bush 
administration officials have said the president would veto such a 
bill

a group that includes atampt will get a jump on 
the competition wednesday when it introduces a version of unix 
baselayer software that it hopes to make into an international 
computing standard 
the introduction is a blow to plans for a rival standard that 
are being formulated by international business machines corp 
digital equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
each group is trying to establish itself as the standardsetter 
for unix an underlying layer of software that makes it easy for 
different kinds of computers to run the same programs computer 
users fear that if the two groups keep fighting there will be two 
incompatible versions of unix 
unix international inc the group that includes atampt said it 
would gather 25 senior figures from the computing world on 
wednesday in new york to endorse the introduction of its unix 
system 5 release 40 the version unifies and enhances several 
previous unix releases 
the group said shipments of the new software would begin early 
next year that gives it a jump on the rival open software 
foundation which is still hammering out standards and does not 
expect to begin major shipments until late in 1990 
the two groups continued to bicker over how much support they 
have 
unix international said its version of unix was the successor to 
the software on more than 80 percent of all currently installed 
unix systems 
the open software foundation countered that an independent 
survey by international data corp found that its members and 
sponsors accounted for more shipments of unix last year than the 
unix internationalaffiliated companies 
atampt invented unix but had to surrender control over its 
development to unix international to avoid abandonment of the 
standard it created

also did not affect trading mccormack said

negotiators for boeing co and the machinists 
union were back at the bargaining table for a second day tuesday 
with the federal mediator saying both sides were trying hard to 
reach a settlement 
meanwhile the 57800 striking machinists faced the expiration 
of their health care benefits at midnight tuesday although they 
could choose to continue the benefits by paying monthly premiums of 
128 to 354 themselves 
neither boeing nor the machinists union would comment on the 
substance of the talks that began monday although tom baker 
president of machinists district lodge 751 said negotiators were 
able to talk in great detail about the issues 
federal mediator douglas hammond who convened the talks also 
would not discuss what was said but described the negotiations as 
cordial and professional 
these folks have a problem theyre trying to solve and they 
recognize it he said 
hammond has said he wants to hold negotiations daily until a 
settlement is reached 
machinists spokesman jack daniels said the union has a 
counterproposal to the boeing offer which its membership 
overwhelmingly rejected oct 3 but he did not know whether it had 
been presented 
daniels said the mood among pickets at boeing plants is a 
little cheerier now that talks have resumed 
the strike began oct 4 after the union turned down a 3year 
offer that included pay raises of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 
percent bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 
percent in the second costofliving increases to virtually cover 
inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 hours to 160 
hours per quarter and higher benefits 
strikers include 43300 machinists in the seattle area 12000 
in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and a few hundred others 
at scattered sites in california hawaii montana utah and other 
states boeing has a total 164000 workers worldwide and 106000 in 
washington state 
machinists received their last paychecks oct 19 and the first 
of their 100aweek strike payments last thursday however their 
companypaid health plans remained in force through the end of 
october 
boeing offers a variety of medical plans but daniels said the 
cost of a medical plan for a single person would be 12886 a 
month and for a family 35446 striking workers have 60 days 
after the health coverage ends to decide whether to continue the 
coverage on their own 
on wednesday boeing begins maintable bargaining with its 
secondlargest union the seattle professional engineering 
employees association which represents about 30000 engineers and 
technical workers subcommittees of speea and boeing negotiators

the sneaker maker reebok unveiled its new 
inflatable basketball shoe called the pump on tuesday and said it 
planned to spend an unusually large 15 million to advertise it 
its main competitor nike inc said it is already shipping 
similar shoes called nike air pressure to retailers although it has 
not created special ads for them 
nike and reebok are the leaders in athletic footwear and their 
new shoes are among the highest priced reeboks cost 170 a pair 
and nikes cost 175 
frank oconnell president of reebok north america said 
basketball shoes accounted for 300 million of reeboks 13 
billion in domestic sales last year he said orders have already 
been placed for 50000 pairs of the new shoes which were shown to 
retailers earlier 
nike is the leader in basketball shoes with about 43 percent of 
that market and sold 414 million in basketball shoes last year 
spokeswoman elizabeth dolan said 
atlanta hawks basketball star dominique wilkins was on hand for 
the introduction of the reeboks pump shoes at a news conference 
held on the basketball court at hunter college in manhattan 
he and nba players byron scott danny ainge dennis johnson and 
doc rivers and coaches pat riley of the los angeles lakers and 
digger phelps of notre dame appear in ads debuting later this 
month in which they describe in unrehearsed and often humorous 
style how the shoes work 
the hightopped shoes have an orange button on the tongue that 
can be pressed to pump air into a speciallydesigned plastic 
bladder forming a readilyadjusted cushion around the ankle heel 
and instep to support the foot and protect it against the damaging 
effects of jarring sudden moves 
the air is released by depressing a separate valve on the back 
collar of the shoe 
wilkins told the news conference the shoes provide a lot of 
support enabling him to skip taping his ankles as he normally does 
with other shoes before playing 
the shoes should start arriving in stores shortly after nov 15 
and the company plans to spend 5 million on advertising them for 
the final two months of 1989 and another 10 million in the first 
six months of 1990 oconnell said 
the nike air pressure shoes are inflated with a small plastic 
hand pump that is separate from the shoe 
ms dolan said that while having the pump separate from the shoe 
may not be convenient nikes tests showed an entirely internal

creditor banks have made tentative agreements with mexico the 
philippines and costa rica 
on the most important deal with mexico more than 400 banks 
were due to report their decisions by midnight tuesday to citibank 
which heads the committee dealing with mexican debt 
the banks had a choice of reducing their share of mexicos debt 
reducing its interest payments making new loans to it or some 
combination of the three options their decisions will affect about 
53 billion of mexicos debt nearly half the total mexicos main 
objective is to reduce the 128 billion it is due to pay this year 
in interest on its debt 
camndessus defended the imfs new policy of making new loans of 
its own to the debtor countries before they come to an agreement 
with private banks a frenchman he is responsible to the 152 
governments that own the fund with the united states as the 
biggest contributor 
the banks have not understood he said they thought we 
did not care about the arrears owed to them we made our decision 
with our eyes open the purpose was to disburse a little first to 
show our committment and speed up the negotiations 
negotiations between creditor banks and venezuela have stalled 
talks between the banks and argentina which is 4 billion behind 
on its interest payments alone were due to start in new york this 
week 
no progress can be made on the situation of brazil the biggest 
third world debtor until after a government is installed after the

official called its messy economy the official who spoke on 
condition has name not be used said the new government is trying 
to move from a communist economy to one ruled by market forces 
with inadequate structures and institutions obsolete factories and 
a totally distorted price system all amid the high expectations 
of a country seeking more liberty 
the imf is trying to set up a 1year program to prevent the 
polish economy from getting worse in preparation for a 3year 
accord to be negotiated later 
the official said it would take patience from the poles and a 
sustained effort by imf donor countries 
he pointed to the need for food aid in poland which he said was 
extraordinary for such an industrialized country but necessary so 
that there are supplies on hand as prices are freed 
camdessus spoke to reporters at a meeting sponsored by the 
bretton woods committee a private group concerned with the affairs 
of the imf and its sister organization the world bank
