there is no freedom without 
solidarity was the slogan shouted at countless rallies and 
marches since the east blocs first independent trade union was 
crushed by martial law in 1981 
but now that the union has lived through seven years of 
jailings beatings and even killings to win back its right to 
exist what will solidarity become 
many of the 10 million men and women who were active in the 
solidarity opposition movement of 198081 have emigrated or gone on 
to other activities 
some of its leaders have fallen away from the movement in 
disputes with chairman lech walesa 
a new generation of workers angry at shortages low wages and 
long waits for apartments has come to the fore many dont 
remember the solidarity of 198081 and have only a vague notion of 
what they want it to become 
but a core of activists behind walesa never let the flame die 
during the hard cold winter of martial law professors workers 
priests farmers or aging activists whose names are little known in 
the west they tend to share an intense stubbornness typified by 
another solidarity chant we will win 
solidarity currently is built around of circle of these old 
activists with a sprinkling of new leaders who emerged during two 
waves of strikes last year 
since 1987 the union has had a national executive committee 
chaired by walesa that convenes whenever a major decision is to be 
made it is composed of about 20 members representing regions of 
the country or various constituencies most regions also have 
regional executive commissions made up of representatives of 
factorylevel solidarity committees 
besides its worker base solidarity has a brain trust of 
advisers linked to the former opposition group the committee for 
the defense of workers 
these figures who played a major role in the negotiations that 
have led to reinstating solidarity include historian bronislaw 
geremek essayist adam michnik political theoretician jacek kuron 
and journalist tadeusz mazowiecki 
the national executive committee essentially was picked by 
walesa from activists loyal to him wellknown leaders from 
198081 such as andrzej gwiazda of gdansk or stefan jurczyk of 
szczecin were left off the commission 
a circle of these leaders said in december it had formed a 
working group critical of walesas leadership of the union and 
his willingness to compromise with authorities answering their 
calls for new union elections walesa has promised elections after 
solidarity is legalized 
walesa has also hinted occasionally he would like to relinquish 
solidaritys leadership once the union has been reestablished if 
he were to take the step younger leaders such as zbigniew bujak of 
warsaw wladyslaw frasyniuk of wroclaw or mieczyslaw gil of krakow 
probably would be first in line to take his place 
at the grassroots level the number of factory solidarity 
organizations is growing all the time every day said union 
spokesman wojciech maziarski in warsaw alone he said the union 
knows of factory organizations at 200 workplaces in kielce a 
provincial capital of 200000 people there are 6070 solidarity 
committees in factories 
no one not even solidarity knows how many members it has 
nationwide bujak at a public forum earlier this year estimated the 
figure at about 1 million and walesa told reporters friday that he 
expected it to grow to 5 million to 7 million members 
but it doesnt make sense to talk about current membership 
said maziarski because there is no list 
walesa has said it will be up to the people who join solidarity 
to decide how it will be organized the sejm or parliament meets 
friday to pass the law on trade unions that will enable solidarity 
to be legalized solidarity officials expect it to be registered in 
court next week 
the national executive commission is meeting sunday although 
the purpose of the meeting was not announced in advanced 
presumably the goal will be to draft plans for getting the 
organization functioning smoothly as it drops the vestiges of its 
underground existence 
the national headquarters is expected to be situated in gdansk 
where the union was born after the august 1980 strikes 
as part of its agreement with the government solidarity is to 
be given office space around the country as it had before it was 
banned 
on a factory level solidarity will be obliged to cooperate with 
the official opzz trade unions during negotiations with management 
but the union has made no commitment to cooperate on a regional or 
national level 
both unions say they also expect to compete with each other 
walesa said he would like to see even more competition with 
perhaps a third major union emerging eventually 
with the introduction of freer elections and the prospect of 
opposition representation in the sejm and a new senate solidarity 
will be able to drop some of its responsibility as the main 
opposition force and function solely as a trade union 
solidarity has said it will support independent candidates in 
the election but will not be nominating candidates itself 
instead walesa inaugurated an advisory citizens committee last 
year that draws together representatives of the mainstream 
opposition this group is to bear the brunt of organizing the 
political opposition to the communist party in the june elections

<TEXT>
after a winter of ice and white of 
stilled rivers and violent seas of long sleeps in deep caves and 
distant journeys to warmer shores alaskas wild kingdom is waking 
up and coming home 
waiting in prince william sound for the 1 million migrating 
ducks and geese due this month the 10 million shorebirds passing 
through the endangered humpback minke and fin whales swimming 
north the eagles flying south the millions and millions of salmon 
eggs hatching in the gravel of melting streams and the black and 
brown bears waking up hungry is the largest oil spill in american 
history 
in portions of prince william sound we will have a silent 
spring said jon lyman an alaska department of fish and game 
official already thousands of animals are known dead and 
uncounted thousands more also have probably succumbed 
but that is only the beginning biologists say spring a time of 
rebirth will be a time of death in prince william sound 
we have more and more animals coming in birds moving up from 
the lower 48 to nest whales arriving right on time harbor seals 
and sea lions due to deliver their pups in late may and early 
june said mark kuwada a state habitat biologist if they get 
contaminated they may die 
each spring natures wild kingdom stages a huge family reunion 
among the 10000 square miles of fiords glaciers and rocky islands 
that make up the magnificent spectacle that is prince william sound 
snow is starting to retreat up the mountainsides and green 
shoots poke out from the matted brown stalks along the beaches the 
strengthening sun warms the towering faces of tidewater glaciers 
snaking down from the chugach mountains and halfmoon bays echo 
with the thunder of icebergs tumbling into the cobalt water 
many creatures that wander far off to other climes to escape the 
unforgiving alaskan winter are recommuning to birth their young 
breed and gorge on the abundance that has thrived here since the 
last ice age 
its exciting to see the first varied thrush or rocky 
sandpipers said nancy lethcoe a guide and naturalist who has 
watched the arrival of 20 prince william sound springs from the 
deck of a sailboat 
each april she notes the return of phallaropes and puffins 
trumpeter swans and arctic terns even the resident mallards who 
stick it out in january grow friskier day by day splashing and 
chasing each other across the water 
as spring stretches daylight threequarters of the way around 
the clock prince william sound teems with life 
the daylight makes the plant cells bloom and that kicks 
everything off said rick steiner a university of alaska marine 
biologist whos coordinating the fishermens response to the oil 
spill 
soon youve got plankton soup little bugs eat that the bugs 
wake up the little fish and spawning crabs who live on the bottom 
about that time pink salmon fry and herring start emerging from 
the gravel seabirds and marine mammals eat the herring and small 
fish whales also eat plankton and small fish 
and on and on it goes right up to the king of the realm the 
alaskan brown bear 
bears are going to be eating these dead otters said 
steiner of course bears can eat a can of paint and survive but 
this is pretty toxic stuff 
steiner is anxious to see if any animals will actively avoid the 
spill hes especially optimistic that whales which have a higher 
intelligence than most mammals will swim away because the crude 
oil slick will irritate their skin 
but otters and seals and sea lions arent as mobile he 
said on the water they can barely see 50 feet ahead they dont 
know where else to go 
prince william sound which contains about 800 cubic miles of 
water completely flushes itself about every 20 days said steiner 
but no one knows how much longer the oils stain will scar natures 
face 
all our efforts put together will protect a few streams and a 
few bays he said in the end the sound will cleanse itself 
by then it may be too late for this springs gathering of 
eagles and all their distant cousins but if spring holds no other 
lesson it is that nature renews lethcoe said 
when your child skins her knee for the first time she said 
you think perfection has been destroyed but she gets over it 
given time and no more insults the sound will recover

the writer recently spent six days with afghan 
rebels as they were trying to capture the eastern city of jalalabad 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a shallow trench afghan guerrillas 
dug as a rocketfiring position near the jalalabad airport has 
become a killing ground for their own men they call it kushtargah 
the place of slaughter 
bodies of guerrillas soldiers civilians and livestock are 
scattered along the road to the pakistan border 45 miles away 
explosions of artillery shells and aerial bombs shake the ground 
day and night creating plumes of smoke dirt and debris 
western reporters accompanied 25 guerrillas under a commander 
called shomali on an assault insurgents farther back provided 
cover with rockets and mortar shells that whistled overhead and 
exploded inside the airport 
government forces responded with mortar fire and jets came in 
low to attack two transport helicopters quickly lifted off and 
flew away 
advancing guerrillas hit a helicopter gunship with a 
britishmade blowpipe missile and it crashed inside jalalabad 
they covered 50 yards in stopandgo fashion arrived at 
kushtargah and spotted a tank at the airports edge 100 yards away 
shomali and his brother who was second in command set up a 
milan antitank missile with the help of a mujahedeen who looked 
about 15 years old 
the tank fired one shell a direct hit shomali was critically 
wounded in the head his brother and the boy were killed 
comrades in the rear continued covering fire one rocket fell 
short and hit the survivors killing one and wounding three the 
others fled in panic having spent only a few minutes at the 
place of slaughter 
insurgents known as mujahedeen the islamic holy warriors 
who began fighting after a communist coup 11 years ago besieged 
jalalabad a month ago in their first major offensive since the 
soviet army withdrew feb 15 
they surprised critics by swiftly capturing the heavily 
fortified samarkhel garrison on the citys outskirts but their 
advance has bogged down the guerrillas advance shoot then 
retreat under withering artillery and aerial bombardment from 
defenders who outgun them with soviet weapons 
mujahedeen use multibarreled rocket launchers 82mm and 120mm 
mortars and tanks and artillery taken from captured afghan army 
posts but have difficulty mastering them after a decade of 
hitandrun tactics 
soldiers defending the city and its strategic airport appear 
wellsupplied with such weapons as napalm and airburst artillery 
the artillery and cluster bombs dropped by jets screaming in at low 
altitude are particularly deadly 
both shells and bombs explode a few hundred feet above the 
ground spraying shrapnel into the trenches 
scudb missiles are feared most they are fired from government 
positions near kabul and tear craters in the earth 120 feet across 
no one seems to know how many combatants and civilians have been 
killed and the claims of each about the others losses are 
exaggerated but it is clear from the scene that the toll has been 
high 
afghan officials have offered ceasefires and declared them 
unilaterally since well before the red army ended its nineyear 
involvement and did so again wednesday but nothing has come of 
the effort 
the battle continued around jalalabad 75 miles east of the 
capital and witnesses and the government said the mujahedeen fired 
rockets thursday at kabul kandahar and sarobi 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said government 
soldiers withheld their fire the government timed the unilateral 
truce to coincide with the eve of ramadan the moslem holy month of 
dawntodusk fastingg 
associated press photographer morten hvaal saw a missile hit a 
fuel truck near a oil depot on kabuls northern edge and several 
trucks parked nearby also exploded there was no immediate word on 
casualties 
an afghan truck driver who said he was part of a convoy hauling 
fuel down the salang highway from hayratan on the soviet border 
said mujahedeen tried to hijack some of the trucks about six miles 
north of kabul 
he said the hijackers got about a mile down the road before two 
government helicopters attacked hvaal saw black smoke rising from 
the area

demonstrations in which palestinians are injured 
are common these days during the 16month uprising in the occupied 
territories here is a detailed look at one of them 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the lieutenant chased the 
rockthrowing demonstrators through the dusty streets he turned 
down a corner off the main square and saw the palestinian youth in 
blue jeans and white sneakers he knelt and fired 
the youth fell blood rushing from his head theyve got a 
casualty the lieutenant shouted 
similar scenes of violence are repeated almost daily in the 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip but this time 
the israeli soldiers opened fire in front of reporters and 
photographers 
in thursdays incident there were no warning shouts or shots in 
the air and the use of live ammunition seemed to conflict with 
army regulations 
four soldiers in a jeep rounded a corner into the demonstration 
they were met by about 100 demonstrators who were throwing rocks 
and bottles over roadblocks of flaming tires the soldiers opened 
fire almost immediately 
the victim 17yearold dahoud khaled nassar of bethlehem was 
unconscious and in criticial condition with two bullet wounds to 
the head according to doctors at mukassed hospital in jerusalem 
the lieutenant in his late 30s chased away a reporter and a 
television crew who moved toward the stricken youth he then joined 
another officer shooting after youths running down another narrow 
street in bethlehems madbasa quarter 
residents along the street picked up nassars limp body and took 
it in a car to nearby beit jala hospital doctors there ordered the 
victim transferred to the better equipped mukassed about six miles 
away in jerusalem 
an army spokesman who by military regulation is not identified 
confirmed one youth was shot in a violent confrontation with 
soldiers an initial investigation in the field shows that no 
live ammunition was fired we are continuing to investigate she 
said 
an official in the army spokesmans office who agreed to 
discuss army regulations on firing at demonstrators on condition of 
anonymity said soldiers can only use live ammunition when their 
lives are in danger 
he said soldiers can fire plastic bullets to disperse a violent 
domonstration even if their lives are not endangered but he said 
a soldier is only allowed to fire a plastic bullet at a fleeing 
suspect who has committed a serious offense such as a stabbing 
a soldier cant fire at someone running away if the guy has 
thrown a rock the official said 
after thursdays demonstration doctors said nassar was hit with 
two live rounds none of the soldiers was reported injured in the 
barrage of rocks and bottles 
the demonstration had started like many others about half an 
hour earlier in the commercial district its streets lined with 
shops restaurants and hotels that used to be crowded with pilgrims 
visiting this biblical city where jesus was born 
about 100 people men and women gathered in a small square 
they set up roadblocks of rocks and burning tires at three points 
to block off the area many had their faces covered with checkered 
arab keffiyeh headresses or scarves in the red green black and 
white colors of the outlawed palestinian flag 
they carried a flag too and chanted allahu akbar god is 
great long live the flag they also shouted plo israel no 
and popular revolution against the zionists 
some of the leaders of the chants seemed to be reading them off 
pieces of paper as they shouted women in the crowd gathered rocks 
from the street putting them in buckets at street corners in 
expectation that soldiers might come 
they came four of them in a jeep after the crowd had been 
marching and chanting for about a half hour 
as is usually the case the crowd of masked protesters unleashed 
rocks and empty bottles at the intruders some used slingshots to 
fire stones at the soldiers 
the four soldiers began shooting with rifles almost immediately 
after the jeep stopped with a captain in dark glasses firing from 
the drivers seat 
israeli and foreign photographers and a young arab boy wheeling 
a bicycle who was not part of the protest dived for cover 
then the soldiers still firing began chasing the fleeing 
demonstrators through the surrounding streets three of the troops 
headed down a road to the west and the lieutenant ran after nassar 
on a street to the east 
unlike the others nassar had no scarf covering his face 
after rounding the corner from the square the lieutenant knelt 
with one knee on the dusty pavement amid stones from a roadblock 
placed by the protesters he took careful aim and two shots could 
be heard 
about 40 yards away nassar fell to the ground bleeding from 
behind his right ear

oliver north firmly defended his irancontra 
role thursday from the witness stand at his criminal trial 
declaring he was merely a marine following white house orders i 
was not stepping in i was brought in he said 
north was stopped before he could respond to his lawyers 
suggestion that thenpresident reagan had designated him for the 
role asked directly who told him to secretly help the nicaraguan 
rebels north named former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane mcfarlanes thendeputy john poindexter and the late 
cia director william casey 
norths testimony came shortly after his lawyers read the jury a 
lengthy statement agreed to by prosecutors that said george 
bush had played a role as intermediary in reagans secret effort to 
aid the nicaraguan rebels after congress banned official us help 
as rapidfire developments replaced the sometimeslanguid pace 
of the trial now in in its seventh week the jury heard that bush 
personally told the president of honduras in 1985 that extra aid 
was being funneled to his country in earlier testimony mcfarlane 
had said that the aid was part of a secret agreement calling for 
honduras to help the contras 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we 
cant say anything it would become a part of the case 
north who faces 12 felony charges including lying or misleading 
congress and thenattorney general edwin meese iii about his 
efforts to help the contras testified that he had been ordered by 
his superiors to keep silent about his role in keeping the rebels 
going after the cutoff of official aid 
i was told not to tell anybody north said i was 
particularly admonished to keep secret that another country was 
providing millions of dollars to help the contras 
that was an apparent reference to saudi arabia which supplied 
some 32 million in aid to the contras beginning in mid1984 
north described himself as an ordersobeying marine who had 
planned to return to camp lejeune to command a battalion when top 
officials in the reagan administration enlisted him to run the 
secret contra operation in 1984 
was there a time when you were stepping in to help the 
contras asked north lawyer brendan sullivan 
i was not stepping in i was brought in north replied 
sullivan asked whether north understood that reagan had 
designated him as the contras new provider prosecutor john keker 
objected us district judge gerhard a gesell sustained the 
objection and north didnt answer 
on point after point north said he had permission of superiors 
for project democracy as the help to the contras was known he 
said he had the approval of mcfarlane poindexter and casey the 
orders to keep secret the contributions from other countries came 
from the president casey and mcfarlane he said 
i never made a single trip down there or a single contact 
north said of his frequent visits to central america without the 
permission the express permission of admiral poindexter or 
mcfarlane or usually without the concurrence of director casey 
mcfarlane had testified that he told his staff members the 
congressional ban on helping the contras did apply to them but 
north said i never heard that 
as for raising money he said referring to himself and 
potential contributors i knew colonel north could not ask them 
for money 
after the congressional ban cut off official us aid north 
said he told casey that all the money in the world wouldnt 
replace the former cia assistance he said casey gave him the name 
of retired army maj gen richard secord who basically created a 
mirror image outside the cia to keep provisions coming 
secord a codefendant is to be tried later 
north testified for about 2 hours including recreation of the 
halfhour slide show which he gave 75 to 100 times to potential 
contributors to the contras while he was working at the white 
house he will return to the stand friday morning 
the retired marine lieutenant colonel dressed in a dark suit 
sat down in the witness box nearly two months after the trial began 
and nearly two years after he told his story in televised 
congressional hearings that made him a national figure the 
congressional testimony was given under a grant of immunity from 
prosecution and prosecutors in the current case have had to avoid 
seeing or hearing anything about that appearance 
so youre colonel north sullivan began as the former white 
house aide took the stand yes sir i am north replied with a 
smile 
earlier his lawyers spent nearly an hour reading into the 
record the admission of facts concerning the reagan 
administrations efforts supporting the contra struggle against the 
leftist government of nicaragua 
in addition to the statements about bushs involvement the 
document also said that a representative of panamanian leader 
manuel noriega offered in a meeting with north to assassinate 
sandinista leaders in nicaragua but that north replied the united 
states wanted no part of that 
in panama city late thursday panamanian maj edgardo lopez 
denounced the allegations in a written statement that called it 
another cockandbull story of the united states to continue 
strangling the panamanian people and intensify its defamation 
campaign against the chief of our defense forces 
the statements summary format allowed the trial to proceed 
without disclosure of the classified documents that much of the 
statement was based upon 
the document said bush who has repeatedly said he had little or 
nothing to do with the irancontra affair relayed a march 1985 
reagan offer of expedited military aid to honduran president 
roberto suazo 
earlier in the trial mcfarlane testified that reagan personally 
approved the secret deal to slip 110 million in extra aid to 
honduras as one of several quid pro quo arrangements with other 
countries in exchange for support for the contras 
the statement on thursday said vice president bush also 
informed suazo that president reagan had directed that currently 
withheld economic assistance for honduras should be released that 
the united states would provide from its own military stocks 
critical security assistance items that had been ordered by 
honduran armed forces and that several security programs under way 
for honduran security forces would be enhanced 
earlier thursday prosecutors asked the judge to order north to 
produce his notebooks and ledgers if the former marine decided to 
testify and thereby waive his privilege against 
selfincrimination 
also on thursday former hostage david jacobsen testified that 
when he and north met after jacobsens release from lebanon 
norths eyes filled with tears because other americans were still 
held

pulitzer prizewinning author and 
astronomer carl sagan says the united states and the soviet union 
should join forces and head for mars 
the show of cooperation between the two superpowers could revive 
a space exploration program that has been dormant for 10 years 
sagan told more than 400 scientists and aerospace specialists 
gathered wednesday for a symposium 
sagan joked that the joint mission might trigger a dispute over 
who would get to set foot first on mars i have one solution 
sagan said we tie together the ankles of the soviet and us 
astronauts or perhaps a better solution posed by the europeans 
let them be first 
sagan told reporters after his speech that he thinks heading to 
mars is a better next step for space exploration than establishing 
a presence on the moon 
the moon worries me sagan said the moon is dull weve 
been to the moon it is unchanging people are fundamentally 
bored with it 
mars on the other hand is a dynamic world it has weather 
it has climatic change it is something that will occupy our 
exploratory sense for a great period of time

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
proposal to hold elections among palestinian arabs gives at least 
temporary momentum to american diplomacy in the middle east which 
has been at a standstill for months 
in principle the proposal won the endorsement of president 
bush who called on the palestinians and the arab states on 
thursday to think creatively along with israel about ways to 
promote peace in the middle east 
the president also offered the good offices of the united states 
to move the peace process forward 
so even though secretary of state james a baker iii is not 
packing his bags yet and bushs support for the election of 
palestinian leaders is qualified the administration can expect to 
be critically involved in the explosive situation for the 
indefinite future 
israel looks to the united states for support and the arabs 
look for leverage from washington on israel so the 
administrations involvement was probably inevitable in any event 
strategically bush and baker are pursuing a gradual approach 
but they are also beginning to make their views clear to the 
parties 
they want israel and the arabs to negotiate directly with each 
other therefore they support a middle east peace conference only 
if it will not get in the way of direct negotiations 
the united states will keep talking to the palestine liberation 
organization despite israels protests using the dialogue to try 
to lower tensions on the west bank and gaza 
last month baker suggested while testifying to a house 
subcommittee that maybe israel should talk to the plo in order to 
have meaningful negotiations over the palestinian issue he 
pulled back later but the idea is still out there and could come 
up again 
on monday bush declared in the presence of visiting egyptian 
president hosni mubarak that israels occupation of the west bank 
and gaza must come to an end 
on thursday with shamir at his side the president got even 
tougher on israel he said he had told the prime minister we do 
not support an independent palestinian state nor israeli 
sovereignty or permanent occupation of the west bank and gaza 
the first point is shaded in israels favor shamir reiterated 
during his visit that a palestinian state would pose an 
unacceptable danger to israel 
the other two points are sweet music to the arabs who demand a 
total withdrawal from the lands israel captured during the 1967 
sixday war 
previous us presidents have said an overall settlement should 
involve landforpeace that meant israel should give up territory 
in exchange for arab recognition 
bush this week seemed to be taking the us position a couple of 
decisive steps further his statements might preclude israel 
retaining any of the territory 
if the two sides ever get to the peace table the issues of 
palestinian statehood and israeli sovereignty will be hotly 
contested bushs statement is advance notice to arabs and israelis 
how the united states is likely to come down on these points 
but in the meantime shamirs proposal to hold elections among 
the palestinians is controversial enough to keep everyone 
including the united states busy 
there are lots of questions to be answered 
when would the election be held how would it be supervised 
and most important of all will palestinians accept shamirs 
invitation 
shamir said at a news conference thursday the election should be 
held in a calm atmosphere he would like the palestinians to 
suspend their revolt but the continuing uprising in the 
territories may be their strongest card 
shamir also said international supervision of the balloting 
would not be necessary he said israelis and palestinians would 
oversee the election and that it would be held within israels 
democratic traditions 
will the palestinians participate shamir said he thought they 
would despite the plos objections that remains to be seen 
unfazed at the end of a trying day baker said he still felt 
encouraged 
there will be a number of specific questions with respect to 
which there will be differences of opinion he told reporters 
but he said shamirs election proposal affords an 
opportunity for a process to begin something if i may say so 
that we did not have before

a document produced in oliver norths trial 
sheds new light on george bushs role in the irancontra affair 
showing that he helped the reagan administration effort to support 
the nicaraguan contras despite a ban on us aid 
the document read to the irancontra jury by norths defense 
attorneys placed bush at a may 1985 meeting in honduras with 
thenpresident roberto suazo it says bush informed suazo of 
president reagans decision to speed us military and economic aid 
to the country 
what set up the bush meeting were behindthescenes discussions 
among north and other us officials on a plan to seek assistance 
from other countries to tide over the nicaraguan rebels at a time 
when direct or indirect american assistance was outlawed by 
congress 
a preface to the document said the united states has admitted 
for purposes of this trial the following facts to be true and it 
went to lengths to stitch together how the secret covert support 
program worked 
in effect the reagan program established a quid pro quo 
relationship basing us assistance to honduras and some other 
countries at least in part on those countries willingness to help 
sustain the contra fighting force 
there was no indication that bush cited this linkage in his 
meeting with suazo but in earlier testimony former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane had said the aid was part of a 
secret agreement calling for honduras in return to help the 
contras 
portions of the document show bush as an enthusiastic supporter 
of the effort to tide over the contras until direct us assistance 
could be resumed 
in early march 1985 for instance bush asked mcfarlane whether 
he the vice president should encourage a private group to 
donate a planeload of medical supplies that would arrive in 
honduras coincident with bushs meeting with suazo 
bush strongly favored such a flight the document said 
noting that the unidentified group was supportive of the 
resistance it said north told mcfarlane that bushs idea was 
sound the document did not reveal whether the planeload of 
supplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit 
asked on thursday about the revelation of bushs gobetween role 
with the honduran leader white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said we cant say anything it would become a part of 
the case 
bush has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion of iran 
armssales proceeds to the contras although he admitted knowing 
about the clandestine arms sales to iran and said he supported the 
initiative with certain reservations donald gregg his national 
security adviser during the period in question said he did not 
tell bush about the contra resupply effort that gregg had learned 
about from felix rodriguez a onetime cia associate 
two maine senators who played key roles in the congressional 
investigation of the irancontra affair democrat george mitchell 
and republican william cohen said in a book published last year 
that bushs role in the scandal remained unanswered 
and rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house irancontra 
panel said in the wake of the congressional probe that the country 
still lacked a full and complete explanation of bushs role 
a source who had been involved in the congressional committees 
investigation who discussed the situation thursday on grounds of 
anonymity said bush didnt leave very many footprints anywhere 
it needs to be said that the extent of his knowledge was not our 
major goal we were more interested in what the president reagan 
knew 
but this source also said that it was because he left so few 
footprints i think that he was treated so well in the final 
investigative report by the congressional panel 
according to the court document bush personally told suazo 
during their may 1985 meeting in honduras that extra aid was being 
funneled to his country 
mcfarlane testified reagan personally approved the secret deal 
to slip 110 million in extra aid to honduras as one of several 
quid pro quo arrangements with other countries in exchange for 
support for the contras 
mcfarlane said reagan telephoned suazo to gain the release of an 
arms shipment to the contras that had been seized by a honduran 
military commander 
the statement entered in court said vice president bush also 
informed suazo that president reagan had directed that currently 
withheld economic assistance for honduras should be released that 
the united states would provide from its own military stocks 
critical security assistance items that had been ordered by 
honduran armed forces and that several security programs under way 
for honduran security forces would be enhanced 
in a dec 3 1986 speech to the american enterprise institute 
here little more than a week after the irancontra affair broke 
into public view bush said that whie he was aware of reagans 
iran arms sales and had supported them i was not aware of and 
oppose any diversion of funds any ransom payments or any 
circumvention of the will of the congress 
a presidentiallyappointed investigative commission headed by 
former sen john tower rtexas and a joint congressional panel 
found no meaningful role by bush 
the newly released document revealed that bush saw several north 
memoranda involving the secret us effort to aid the contras 
although it did not contradict bushs assertions that he never knew 
about the diversion of the iranian armssales proceeds to the 
nicaraguan resistance

no vaccine is completely safe or effective but a 
highly vaccinated population remains the best way to reduce the 
incidence of several once widespread diseases say federal health 
officials 
the centers for disease control issued its general 
recommendations on immunization in a publication directed at 
physicians and public health authorities it is the cdcs first 
update of its general recommendations for vaccine policy in six 
years 
in the statement thursday from its immunization practices 
advisory committee the atlantabased cdc stressed that both 
benefits and risks are associated with the use of all 
immunobiologics 
no vaccine is completely safe or completely effective 
modern vaccines are safe and effective but not completely so 
the cdc said noting that possible side effects range from mild 
discomfort to rare lifethreatening illnesses 
the agency took aim at some common misconceptions about 
vaccinations it said that among the misconceptions heard most 
often are that these conditions preclude vaccination a mild 
illness in an otherwise healthy child mild side effects to a 
previous diphtheriatetanuspertussis shot pregnancy of the mother 
or someone else in the house or a nonspecific history of 
allergies in general 
there have been instances when an outbreak would be 
investigated and wed ask people why they hadnt been 
vaccinated said dr steve wassilak a specialist with the cdcs 
division of immunization 
it turns out to be fairly common that the family went to a 
clinic and the child did not receive its vaccination because the 
child was ill with nothing more than a cold he said this is 
an effort to remind physicians and nurses that they shouldnt 
err on the side of not vaccinating as often 
however the cdc added patients with weakened immune systems 
such as aids patients should not be given most vaccines made with 
live viruses except under certain conditions and because of the 
risk of infecting a developing fetus women should not receive live 
vaccines in most cases if they are pregnant or anticipate 
becoming pregnant soon the cdc said 
vaccines are still recommended for most children to prevent such 
diseases as polio measles mumps and diphtheria vaccines also 
remain recommended for people at risk of severe complications from 
the flu such as older people or the chronically ill and for 
those at increased risk of rabies exposure

surgery like youth should not be wasted only on 
the young or at least the elderly should feel free to undergo it 
say researchers who found patients in their 90s tolerate operations 
relatively well 
if surgery truly can improve the quality of your life you 
should not be inhibited by age said dr mark a warner 
coauthor of a study on surgery patients 90 years old and older at 
the mayo clinic in rochester minn 
in the past people were not being operated on purely because 
they were old and people believed they were frail and they would 
not survive the surgery he said in telephone interview thursday 
we were surprised at how well they did and that the rate of 
surgery has increased dramatically in the 90andup age group he 
said 
warner and his colleagues found the 30day survival rate after 
surgery was 916 percent among the 795 patients age 90 and older 
who underwent operations from 1975 through 1985 at the mayo clinic 
a year after their operations 686 percent of the original 
group were still alive and five years later 212 percent 
survived about the same percentage as would be expected to live 
for five years among people the same age who had not had 
operations the researchers said 
these data demonstrate that patients 90 years of age and older 
tolerate the stress of a surgical procedure relatively well the 
researchers said 
what the figures dont show is the major improvement in quality 
of life even if only for a year or two that surgery can provide 
for extremely elderly patients warner said 
for example a 95yearold woman with colon cancer might not be 
considered a good candidate for surgery because of the likelihood 
the malignancy has spread he said 
but forgoing the operation will doom her to bowel obstructions 
that will rob her of her independence and keep her bedridden and 
miserable for the last six months of her life he said 
surgery may well prolong her life two years and though she will 
likely succumb to spreading cancer she will remain much more 
independent and physically comfortable than she would without 
surgery he said 
nationwide surgical procedures are performed almost five times 
as often among 90yearolds and older people as they were 10 years 
ago the researchers reported in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
as many as 100000 operations may be performed on the 
approximately 1 million americans in that age group this year 
warner said 
the study suggests a dramatic improvement in survival has 
occurred in the last 20 years two decades ago a 71 percent 
survival rate was reported 30 days after surgery in 90yearolds 
and older undergoing similar procedures the doctors said 
although the recent results are not directly comparable to the 
earlier ones the differences are sufficiently striking to 
suggest that better procedures anesthesia and medical care have 
helped improve the survival rate the doctors said 
the most frequently performed procedures in the mayo clinic 
study were repair of broken hips heart pacemaker implants surgery 
on the digestive system prostate operations and hemorrhoid 
procedures he said

federal agents seized a tugboat mother ship 
loaded with at least five tons of marijuana and three speedboats 
that fled at up to 90 mph in a smuggling ploy out of style since 
the early 1980s officials said thursday 
the mother ship carrying the marijuana from mexico was spotted 
on radar wednesday night about 100 miles southwest of fort myers on 
floridas gulf coast and 14 people had been detained by late 
thursday said coast guard lt jeff karonis 
a new customs service plane designed for night surveillance was 
in the area by chance on a shakedown training flight and for about 
six hours its crew filmed the 105foot honduranregistered mother 
ship and six speedboats that rendezvoused with it 
once the coast guard cutter comes in the speedboats scatter 
like a bunch of bees roger garland air branch chief for the 
us customs service said as he explained the videotape at a news 
conference 
the sophistication of the operation was almost as surprising to 
drug agents as the outmoded mothership smuggling method 
from a communications standpoint when you have an operation 
like that you have a big network karonis said at the news 
conference thats a lot of people willing to stick their necks 
out to be involved in some pretty bad activities 
in recent years the most common marijuana smuggling at sea has 
been on freighters docking in the port of miami yachts with secret 
compartments docking most anywhere and small boats picking up bales 
dropped by aircraft 
something like this is what we had back in the early 80s it 
kind of breaks the trend here said karonis 
garland noted that most recent attention has been focused on 
cocaine smuggled through the bahamas and haiti 
in this case the mother ship the tugboat turtola made its 
last port of call in coatzacoalcos mexico about 120 miles 
southwest of veracruz before entering the gulf of mexico bound for 
tampa 
surveillance teams noticed several speed boats leaving gulf 
coast ports late wednesday when the turtola neared florida the 
coast guard moved in when four speedboats were gathered at the 
mother ship and six had been spotted at various times 
the coast guard boarded the tug while the crew was working below 
deck to sink it karonis said the flooding was brought under 
control the south american crew of five was arrested and the 
coast guard counted 165 bales on board he estimated the total load 
was 10000 to 15000 pounds

powerboat and sailing enthusiasts may get that 
sinking feeling when they enter the renwick gallerys new boat 
show they are greeted by a 28foot vessel whose hull is woven 
from eight bales of sweetsmelling alfalfa hay 
this is art folks 
sixteen contemporary american artists are inviting viewers to 
join them on a voyage of the imagination in vessels of wood glass 
ceramics metals textiles hay and straw back to antiquity and 
forward to the unknown 
voyages depart daily free of charge from the renwick a gallery 
of the smithsonians national museum of american art just down 
pennsylvania avenue from the white house the show opens today and 
runs through aug 6 
the show will be a surprise and astonishment said the 
renwicks jeremy adamson curator of the exhibition these are 
not pleasure boats or pirate ships or sailing yachts these are 
boats of mythology and fantasy and archaic symbolism 
artist michael shaughnessy built his hayboat with a wood 
frame a warp of twine and handfuls of alfalfa hay trucked in from 
rural virginia and his native maine where he is a teacher at the 
university of southern maine 
the humble stuff of animal fodder and primitive huts is his 
favorite sculptural material shaughnessy says because hay 
symbolizes the bond between man and nature and is as near the 
truth as any material i have ever found 
john roloff an artist from oakland calif fashioned the 
jutting bow prow of a glasspaned ship resembling a greenhouse 
which appears to be sinking into the gallery floor 
inside the vessel are rocks and misting waters taken from 
pyramid lake whats remaining of an ancient sea called lake 
lahontan which covered a vast area in northern nevada during the 
ice age roloff said the sinking ship represents his lament for the 
lost purity of the western wilderness 
another dramatic boat is robert hubanys valhalla vertical 
triptych an ascending complex of glowing coals bubbling lights 
ceramic corn stalks snakecovered ladders and recorded drumbeats 
with fish at the bottom and carved birds circling overhead 
hubany says the boat suggests a symbolic passage to 
selfdiscovery or enlightenment 
ann mccoys barque with lion goddess iii employs the 
religious imagery and feminine deities of ancient egypt greece and 
rome plus her sleep therapy with a psychoanalyst to suggest a 
voyage through the night and the dream world of the subconscious 
robert shay a potter ceramics teacher and chairman of the ohio 
state university art department contributed a pockmarked ceramic 
boat with glassy deck but says he prefers pots over boats

oliver north testifying in his own defense 
says toplevel reagan administration officials put him in charge of 
keeping the nicaraguan rebels alive and ordered him to maintain 
total secrecy about the operation 
the cia had been supplying the contras but by october 1984 when 
congress banned further military aid every bit of that cia 
responsibility had been passed on to me north told the jury at 
his criminal trial thursday it was basically a handoff as in 
basketball 
the former national security council aide took the witness stand 
in his own defense for nearly 2 hours the 12 criminal charges 
against him focus on his alleged lies to congress and the attorney 
general about his efforts on behalf of the contras 
thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane told him his 
role as overseer of the contra network could not be revealed 
north testified 
the admonition was reiterated innumerable times by admiral 
poindexter and by director casey said north referring to 
mcfarlanes successor john poindexter and cia director william 
casey 
north said his superiors told him disclosure would jeopardize 
the people doing it the pilots shipping supplies and others in 
the aid network in addition public exposure would jeopardize 
the cias ability to move back in because publicity would make it 
less likely congress would restore military assistance 
norths testimony was preceded by a series of new disclosures 
about the reagan administrations secret assistance to the contras 
among the revelations in the written admissions of fact 
vice president george bush was an intermediary in a secret plan 
approved by reagan and disclosed earlier at norths trial to slip 
honduras an extra 110 million in aid if it would help support the 
contras bush told president roberto suazo that president reagan 
had directed expedited delivery of us military items to 
honduras as well as other steps helpful to honduras 
north met in london in mid1986 with panamanian strongman 
manuel noriega who would try to take immediate actions against 
the sandinistas noriega offered a list of priorities including 
an oil refinery an airport and the puerto sandino offload 
facility 
in an earlier meeting a representative of noriega had said the 
panamanian leader was offering to assassinate the sandinista 
leadership for the us government in exchange he wanted a 
promise from the us government to help clean up noriegas image 
and a commitment to lift the us ban on military sales to the 
panamanian military us law forbade assassinations north told 
the representative who countered by pointing to noriegas help to 
the us government the previous year in blowing up a sandinista 
arsenal when north reported back to his boss poindexter said 
the us government could not be involved in assassination but 
panamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story 
in early 1985 president reagan urged the head of state of 
saudi arabia to continue its support for the resistance saudi 
arabia subsequently made a contribution of more than 25 million 
in a scheme initiated by casey and known as operation tipped 
kettle israel on two occasions secretly supplied the defense 
department with weapons it had confiscated from the plo the cia 
advised congress the weapons would be used for various purposes 
but in fact many of them were provided to the contras as 
congressionally appropriated funds ran out the defense department 
said it would find a way to compensate israel for its assistance 
in his testimony north said that when he needed to set up a 
secret shipping network to funnel supplies to the rebels he went 
to casey and got the name of richard secord 
at the time saudi arabia was pouring at least 1 million a 
month into contra bank accounts but i told casey all the money 
in the world wouldnt keep the rebels in the field 
he basically created a mirror image outside the cia north 
said of the network of private companies secord set up to supply 
the rebels charged in the irancontra affair with north secord 
will be tried separately later 
north depicted himself as a military officer trying to do his 
job and looking forward to heading for camp lejeune to command a 
marine battalion after a grueling stint at the national security 
council in washington 
you had been there three years at the nsc asked sullivan 
three years too long replied north

the bush administration saying it is 
premature to consider a sweeping law of the air opposes the 
idea of an international authority to protect the world against 
changes in climate 
william a nitze deputy assistant secretary of state for the 
environment told members of congress on thursday that some 
countries seek an international agreement and it will be discussed 
at meetings of existing international bodies 
it may also come up when president bush goes to paris this year 
for the annual summit meeting of heads of government of western 
nations and japan 
we believe it is premature however to be considering a 
sweeping law of the air or supranational authorities to deal with 
climate change as some have recently advocated nitze said 
a world climate conference is scheduled next year 
a frenchorganized meeting of 24 governments in the hague in the 
netherlands including france west germany norway and the 
netherlands issued a statement may 11 suggesting the possibility 
of a supranational organization but not endorsing it the united 
states was not invited to the meeting 
a law of the air might be similar to the law of the sea 
a treaty that was negotiated through the united nations the united 
states has opposed it and it has not gone into effect the 
canadian government has suggested an international law of the air 
nitze was testifying before the house foreign affairs 
committees subcommittee on human rights and international 
organizations 
he said the united states will have to evolve its domestic 
strategy and then develop an active international strategy to deal 
with changes in climate 
he forecast a 50 percent chance that by the year 2100 average 
temperatures will be 27 to 81 degrees fahrenheit higher than they 
are today 
such a change could affect all nations and every human activity 
he said winds and current would be altered some areas would get 
more rain and some less the sea would rise and threaten what has 
been built on shores 
but he added that the predictions are uncertain because they do 
not take into account the impact of cloud cover the reactions 
between air and ocean and other variables

the sap from maple trees is running so 
slow in parts of the northeast that some towns have canceled their 
annual pancake breakfasts for lack of syrup 
one guy told me he didnt do enough to cover his pancakes 
said wilson clark president of the vermont maple sugarmakers 
association 
the season for tapping maple trees for sap which is boiled down 
to syrup is nearing the end in southern new england amid signs 
that warm weather and an insect with a taste for maples will 
sharply lower syrup production 
everybody is down at least 50 percent to 75 percent with more 
on the heavy side said edward mccolgan president of the 
massachusetts maple sugar producers association 
mccolgan blamed erratic weather for a poor season in the state 
which usually produces 50000 gallons of syrup annually vermont 
the nations top syrup producing state may be headed for its 
fourth subpar season in a row and new york the second largest 
producer appears headed for a bad season 
but farmers in wisconsin the no 3 producer and northern 
vermont say continued cold spells have brought an averagetogood 
season so far 
in most places the news isnt so sweet first it got cold and 
stayed cold so the sap didnt run and then it warmed up too 
fast mccolgan said now we have temperatures in the 40s but 
with all the rain it isnt getting cold enough at night to keep the 
trees from budding 
some towns in the berkshire hills in western massachusetts have 
canceled pancake breakfasts we just didnt feel right about 
asking for donations of syrup this year said breakfast 
chairwoman helen wells of cummington 
in upstate new york earl parker president of the new york 
state maple producers association said the yield in the 
adirondacks could be down by half southern vermont farmers called 
it their worst season in decades 
on top of the bad weather defoliation of maple trees by the 
pear thrip caused most producers in massachusetts and southern 
vermont to cut back on their taps more than 25 percent didnt tap 
at all 
the fleasized insect was first introduced to california from 
europe in 1904 last spring thrips spread across 2 million acres 
of maples in southern vermont and new hampshire massachusetts 
eastern new york connecticut and pennsylvania 
with sugaring still under way in northern vermont new york and 
wisconsin officials said it was too early to predict how producers 
will fare

so youre colonel north 
it was a question that did not need to be asked but he answered 
anyway as laughter swept the crowded courtroom 
yes i am 
its traditional to start with your name said his lawyer 
oliver laurencewithau north said the defendant 
in nearly two months of testimony north had been depicted as a 
hardcharging marine lieutenant colonel who singlehandedly 
supplied a rebel army raised millions of dollars supervised arms 
shipments to iran deceived congress and violated its laws and in 
general was a loose cannon who was viewed with some suspicion by 
his colleagues at the national security council 
on the witness stand speaking softly to a jury that must decide 
his fate he appeared as an earnest softspoken middleaged man 
with gray hair who insisted he only acted to keep the nicaraguan 
contras alive until congress once again favored them with money to 
fight their battle 
he didnt ask for the assignment on the nsc he said in fact 
i told everyone along the line i wanted to go back to the marines 
where my talents lie 
he was just another of a number of politicalmilitary affairs 
officers t the nsc charged with coordinating things in their areas 
his orders came from two successive national security advisers 
robert c mcfarlane a former marine and john m poindexter a 
threestar admiral in the navy and his relationship with the late 
cia director william casey was not as friend or buddy but as a 
subordinate to a superior 
he said he wanted to go back to the marines after his threeyear 
tour at the nsc was up but mcfarlane said look theres much 
more than being a battalion commander even though thats what he 
wanted to be 
nearly two years ago north took a witnesss oath in a hearing 
room on capitol hill his hair cropped to proper marineofficer 
length with six rows of ribbons on his chest attesting to a 
distinguished military record in court the hair still was short 
but the uniform now was civilian dark blue suit red and blue 
striped tie and white shirt he said yes sir and no sir 
often 
most of the time his hands were folded on the small table in 
front of the witness chair but they became animated when he 
talked first about his family and then his nsc job 
married to betsy sitting in the front row 26 years four 
lovely children the oldest 19 the youngest eight today 
father was in us army mother a school teacher educated in 
public and catholic schools us naval academy commissioned in 
1968 as a marine second lieutenant 
he did the things young marine officers did he said in the 
summer he volunteered for jump school at ft benning ga he did 
some boxing and even sometimes was lucky enough to win 
north quickly hurried over his vietnam service he was in 
about 100 engagements i guess earned the silver star the 
bronze star the navy commendation medal the navy achievement 
medal a couple of purple hearts 
he had an opportunity in court that he didnt get on capitol 
hill he gave the jury the same slide show about central america 
that he gave 75 to 100 times while on the nsc to as few as three 
people and as many as several hundred 
for the jury he lectured in the same pained voice as when hs 
lecturing for 20000 a throw 
the soviet policy goal is to create turmoil in the caribbean 
basin the soviet union in this hemisphere is outspending us 
41 between the rio grande and panama 100 million people are 
threatened in nicaragua in 1985 was the largest standing army 
thats ever been seen in central america 
pictures of contras these people have become the nicaraguan 
resistance they didnt get drafted they volunteered 
and so the drama played before a jury that appeared to pay more 
attention than any time before in the trial

the head of a delawarebased aerospace company 
says the united states leads japan in developing aircraft wings out 
of nonmetallic composites contradicting one of the claimed 
benefits of the fsx fighter deal 
in my opinion the japanese have the most to gain from the fsx 
program in terms of gaining a total understanding of the complete 
system required to produce an effective composite aircraft 
said james n burns a vice president of hercules inc an 
aerospace company based in wilmington 
burns was one of several executives from the aerospace and 
electronics industry to testify thursday over whether the fsx 
fighter deal with japan amounts to a net technological boon or loss 
for the united states 
the testimony before three house science subcommittees came in 
anticipation of the bush administrations agreement being sent to 
capitol hill shortly 
under the deal st louisbased general dynamics and japans 
mitsubishi heavy industries would codevelop and coproduce the 
fsx an advanced version of the us f16 fighter for deployment 
by japan in the late 1990s 
the deal has prompted criticism that it would amount to a 7 
billion giveaway of valuable american technology likely to be used 
by japan to help propel its own aircraft industry into headtohead 
competition with the united states in the world market 
proponents have argued that the deal would allow the united 
states to benefit from technological advances by the japanese in 
composite wing construction and advanced radar 
composites are tough lightweight materials that utilize carbon 
fiber and epoxy resin in place of metal 
burns told the hearing that successful application of composites 
requires sophisticated computer programs and a detailed array of 
data describing performance of the materials under various 
conditions 
in both areas the united states is obviously well ahead of 
the japanese because of the many aircraft applications in the 
united states which employ carbon fiber composites today he 
said the united states has been the world leader in this field 
indisputably 
john mancini a vice president of the american electronics 
association said the electronics group still has reservations 
about the deal but may be willing to soften its opposition in view 
of encouraging signs from the bush administration that they are 
determined to tighten the agreement 
mancini said the associations board initially had decided to 
oppose the fsx because it felt that the agreement provides no 
real benefit to the american electronics industry and will 
accelerate the japanese as competitors in the world avionics 
arena 
the association represents more than 3500 us companies 
involved with electronics and information technology 
testifying in favor of the fsx was joel l johnson 
international vice president of the aerospace industries 
association of america 
we believe that at this time the fsx deal as negotiated is 
probably about the best agreement that is realistically 
achievable he said we would encourage the us government to 
move forward with the agreement with the proviso that the us 
government should monitor closely the willingness of japan to make 
available technology to the united states 
johnson added we should continue to press the japanese for an 
equitable share of production of the aircraft as well but we do 
not believe that it would be in our interest to encourage the 
japanese to walk away from this agreement and pursue their original 
objective of building a new aircraft without us involvement

the agriculture department has sold 5000 
metric tons of surplus butter and butteroil to brazil for 985 
million a fraction of what the government paid for it under the 
dairy price support program 
richard w goldberg acting undersecretary said thursday that 
the 2000 tons of butteroil and 3000 tons of butter were sold by 
the departments commodity credit corp to petrobras comercio 
internacional sainterbras a brazilian state trading company 
deliveries of the surplus products are scheduled through 
september no credit arrangements were involved 
federal laws including last years hunger relief act mandate 
the export sale of 150000 tons of dairy products annually through 
september 1990 so far this fiscal year sales have totaled 15763 
tons goldberg said 
according to a recent report on ccc holdings surplus butter as 
of jan 31 totaled about 155000 metric tons and butteroil 1640 
tons a metric ton is approximately 2205 pounds 
the report showed that ccc had an investment of about 146 per 
pound in the butter and 164 in the oil the price charged to 
brazil was about 84 cents per pound for the butter and 98 cents for 
the butteroil 
sales are made to foreign buyers at approximately the prevailing 
world market prices so as not to undercut other foreign suppliers

they argued passionately they joked they 
discussed their grandchildren and they were solemn 
and after four hours of talks thursday the unlikely 
relationship between margaret thatcher the doctrinaire 
anticommunist and mikhail gorbachev the newlook leader of the 
soviet union had reached new heights 
the soviets struggled for superlatives 
i am at a loss for words said soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady gerasimov after gorbachev and mrs thatcher met 
thursday any positive adjective you would like to use you can 
apply to the talks 
this was the day when the relationship between them did reach 
a new high characterized by one word and that is openness 
said a british spokesman 
they have not gone to the firstname terms that characterized 
mrs thatchers friendship with ronald reagan but they have a 
spark of chemistry that sir bryan cartledge former british 
ambassador to moscow explains as the attraction of a communist and 
a conservative who are really quite similar 
theyre both radicals said cartledge who watched mrs 
thatcher in action in moscow two years ago neither of them has 
much time for empty rhetoric they get down to business very 
quickly and very easily 
it was like that from their first meeting in 1984 when 
gorbachev then no 2 in the kremlin came to london mrs thatcher 
declared then i like mr gorbachev we can do business 
together 
and they have this weeks 40hour visit was the third time 
gorbachev has singled mrs thatcher out for special treatment 
following her trip to the soviet union in april 1987 and his 
stopover in britain that december en route to a washington summit 
she admires a leader who is trying to change everything just as 
she set out to do 10 years ago with her own perestroika or 
economic restructuring when she ousted a labor party government 
and pledged to wipe out socialism from britain 
he is trying to do for the soviet economy what we have done 
for the british economy in the last 10 years said british 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe in an interview this week with 
abc news 
they also saw each other clearly from the start said howe she 
recognized that however reformist he will always be a communist 
he acknowledged she is a diehard capitalist 
so there was a clarity of understanding from the outset and i 
think that he recognizes in her a determined successful political 
leader she recognizes the same in him so they have many points on 
which they would like as it were to compare notes 
they also complement each others political needs through 
gorbachev mrs thatcher can project the kind of statesmanship that 
puts the great back in britain gorbachev for his part knows that 
if he is to woo western opinion he must first win the sympathy of 
europes staunchist conservative 
in unusually colorful language a thatcher spokesman said 
thursdays talks were animated warm passionate and sometimes 
solemn 
they love arguing he added requesting anonymity they 
have this way of arguing very strongly but never losing their 
tempers 
in public with mrs thatcher gorbachev was quick to joke she 
called the rain a natural massage when he arrived wednesday he 
corrected her when she said theyd had 2 hours of talks that was 
the formal agenda he noted but theyd talked for another 90 
minutes 
we continued until this very moment without even breaking our 
conversation for lunch he said conveying the impression of two 
powerful people who have a lot to talk about and too little time to 
say it 
in private officials reported personal exchanges too 
gorbachev 58 a grandfather of two congratulated 63yearold mrs 
thatcher on the birth last month of her first grandchild 
gorbachev and mrs thatcher share an intense dislike for 
entrenched bureaucracy as an associate once remarked mrs 
thatcher cannot look at an institution without wanting to hit it 
with her handbag 
gorbachev showed his sense of humor when mrs thatcher reached 
for her handbag during their talk he quickly remarked ah the 
handbag

here are excerpts of testimony by oliver north 
on thursday in the irancontra trial as he was questioned by 
defense attorney brendan sullivan 
 
sullivan so youre colonel north 
north yes sir i am 
sullivan its traditional to start with stating your full name 
and 
north oliver laurence with a u north 
sullivan colonel north its been two and a half years or so 
since youve left the national security council in november 1986 
hasnt it 
north yes sir it has 
sullivan now describe for the jury the circumstances of your 
having been assigned to the national security council 
north i was a student enrolled in the naval war college which 
is the commanding staff course as a major and one afternoon i was 
pulled out of class and told to come down and interview here in 
washington with a number of general officers for an assignment in 
washington i did so of course and found myself interviewing with 
the commandant of the marine corps i guess that day or the next 
day and the secretary of the navy and was sent over to the white 
house to interview with the national security advisor 
sullivan did you ever ask for the assignments 
north no sir i told each one of them along the line that i 
would prefer to go back to the marines which is where i thought my 
talents were 
sullivan is it fair to say that your work in the five and a 
half years you were there colonel north was focused on three 
basic areas one of which would be the secret project which has 
never been revealed and is not part of the case and the other two 
would be counter terrorism and central america problems 
north yes sir those would be the three principal areas of 
responsibility it didnt come all at once but it came in phases 
 
sullivan tell us at this point about your relationship with 
william casey the director of the central intelligence agency as 
of the spring of 1984 first off tell the jury who he was theyve 
heard a lot about him but who he was from your point of view 
north director casey was in my humble estimation a remarkable 
man he was at age 70 plus had more energy than i have or even 
these lawyers of mine he was able to go a full day of work at 12 
14 hours a day and he was also as he frequently reminded 
people around him a and no offense intended counsel but he was a 
very good lawyer and he reminded people of that 
sullivan what was your relationship to him on a business level 
youre a young marine officer and hes a cabinet officer 
north it was notwithstanding what others have said i did 
not consider director casey to be a friend or a buddy or anything 
like that he was a man that i respected and admired i believe 
it was one of subordinate to a superior 
sullivan did there come a time in 1984 when the cia was getting 
out of the business of assisting the freedom fighters that you were 
stepping in to fulfill that kind of a role 
north well i was not stepping in i was basically broadening 
marines i guess want to volunteer for things but i i believe 
if director casey and what he and mr mcfarlane said was that the 
case was and thats all i have to go on was what they said to me 
as this political dispute got worse in the spring of 1984 the 
president had chaired a number of meetings of what was called when 
i worked down there the national security planning group that 
group met a number of times in the spring looking for alternatives 
to how we were going to continue to support the resistance i 
attended a number of those meetings as the note taker not as a 
participant it was very clear that they wanted to find some 
way of continuing the support that the president was adamant 
that those people that we had put in the field that we had armed 
and equipped and sent into combat should not be abandoned 
as a consequence of one of those meetings mr mcfarlane told me 
to first of all make contact with a resistance leader in central 
america i was told to go to director casey find out which of 
these resistance leaders should receive funding and to get foreign 
accounts into which to put that money i did so

sullivan now sir in the spring of 1984 you had been at the 
nsc for about three years correct 
north three years too long yes sir 
sullivan and that was a time when an officer would normally go 
back to normal uniformed marine duties correct 
north yes sir 
sullivan what happened that prevented you from going back to 
the marine corps at the end of your threeyear tour at the nsc 
north i probably learned a little bit about it right here in 
this courtroom because i didnt know all of what you have come to 
know about that i a number of times had discussions with mr 
mcfarlane who was my boss with don fortier who was my immediate 
superior to the effect that i had orders and was going to go back 
to camp lejeune at one of the meetings i had with director casey 
about the time all of this is being set up down south he told me 
that look there is more important things than being the battalion 
commander which is what i wanted to be i expressed to him my 
reservations about staying at the nsc and he said well we will 
take care of that and indeed he did or someone did because i 
was called by the commandant of the marine corps and told that i 
would not be detached from the nsc and wasnt given a chance to i 
guess marines shouldnt be whine about it 
sullivan now once the cia is out and the freedom fighters are 
left on their own how did they function at that time period in 
october 1984 what were the problems 
north everything that they had from the little tents that 
they lived in to the homes that they had for their children to the 
food they ate the weapons they carried the bullets that they had 
everything had come from the cia all of the intelligence all of 
the operations planning through the summer slowly but 
surely more and more of that cia responsibility had been i 
suppose passed on to me basically what we would call a hand 
off just like in basketball i suppose you got the ball go on 
with it 
sullivan did you understand your assignment to be directly from 
the president with his words that mr mcfarlane uttered here in 
court about keeping them together body and soul 
mr keker objection your honor leading 
sullivan what did you understand your assignment to be 
north i understood it very clearly to be that i would be the 
one to replace the cia for each of these activities 
judge gesell who told you that 
north mr mcfarlane told me admiral poindexter told me 
director casey told me on a number of occasions i was told not to 
tell other people not to talk about it to keep my operational 
role very very secret that it should not be something that others 
came to know about i was particularly admonished that this should 
never ever be revealed the fact that another country was 
providing millions of dollars to help the resistance 
sullivan now colonel part of your responsibilities at the nsc 
were very public in terms of briefings and things that you would 
give is that correct 
north many of us did briefings on our respective areas of 
responsibility to the american people 
sullivan you have heard evidence in the court about the fact 
that some of the donors like mrs garwood and mrs newington 
attended those briefings at functions organized by mr channells 
organization nepl correct 
north yes sir 
sullivan about how many briefings would you have given over the 
course of the time you were at the nsc on the subject of nicaragua 
and its needs 
north i would guess i probably gave ballpark 75 to 100 
briefings total in the period of time 1983 through the time i left 
the nsc in 1986 
sullivan now sir colonel north focusing on the time period 
in 1984 when money is no longer being provided to the cia to 
provide support to the resistance and you have had a hand off so 
to speak what were the ways that the administration looked out to 
help the resistance fighters 
north the first steps that were taken were to get financing 
from foreign countries that was initiated by as i described it 
mr mcfarlane and director casey giving me the person to be in 
touch with 
sullivan now this was called third country support 
north i would call it third country financial support yes 
sullivan how was money raised from other countries 
north initially by mr mcfarlane contacting directly the 
ambassador of saudi arabia money went in i think at the rate 
of about a million dollars a month which turned out to be not 
enough and so i went back to mr mcfarlane and said we need more 
money and at some point later on in either late 84 or early 85 
the president asked the king for more and the king chipped in a 
total i think of 32 million over that period of time 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
sullivan now what was your understanding regarding the 
confidentiality of that kind of relationship between saudi arabia 
and the united states in giving that kind of money 
north i was told point blank by mr mcfarlane not to reveal 
that to anyone that that was the direction of the president of the 
united states that i would not could not reveal it in fact was 
chastised for letting director casey know that this whole thing was 
proceeding as it was 
sullivan were there other countries that assisted the united 
states when the congress wouldnt give money 
north yes there were there were other countries that provided 
2 million in the case of taiwan there was eventually 10 million 
from the country of brunei made an effort to submit but due to a 
numerical error in the account it never arrived 
sullivan now aside from money once you get friendly nations 
providing some money to support the freedom fighters did you also 
establish what was called project democracy 
north as the money began to flow director casey and then 
the people from the central intelligence agency others individuals 
pointed out the need to expand the activities to basically try 
to replace the cias full service if you will to the resistance 
and i went back to director casey i asked him for the name of 
a person who would be able to do these things and he gave me the 
name of general richard secord and so i went to general secord 
and he basically set up to provide those kinds of services to the 
resistance that the cia had provided before but to do it outside 
the us government 
sullivan did you talk with mr casey about the applicability of 
the boland amendment to the national security council 
north i talked to director casey i talked to mr mcfarlane i 
talked to the nsc lawyers none of them thought that it applied 
to the nsc 
sullivan when secord was brought into the picture and he 
developed these companies was that an effort to comply with the law 
north well precisely because what general secord did was to 
set up a series of organizations that would do what the cia had 
done before he basically created a mirror image outside the 
government of what the cia had done 
sullivan what kind of projects was he working on particularly 
north well he started out basically delivering munitions 
it got to the point where when a southern front became an absolute 
necessity he was the one who contracted to build that airfield in 
costa rica i guess the other part of that thats not real clear is 
that we had to work with the neighboring countries 
sullivan now sir when secord is operating out of these 
neighboring countries is it necessary for high level american 
officials to have permission from the officials of those countries 
north yes it would be impossible to do these things 
without the permission of the highest levels of their governments 
i mean it would be a disaster if you tried to do it without their 
help in some cases i even had to meet with the presidents of 
those countries so that those people would agree to the kinds of 
support and the kinds of measures that we were taking 
sullivan now whenever you had such a contact with an official 
of a neighboring country in central america would you always have 
the permission of your superiors 
north yes sir i never made a single trip down there whether 
it was an official trip that was paid for by the nsc or whether it 
was a trip that was paid for out of the resistance funds never 
made a single trip never made a single contact with anybody down 
there without the permission express permission of either mr 
mcfarlane or admiral poindexter and usually when i could with 
the concurrence of director casey

sullivan during the time that you were acting in the capacity 
of trying to keep the freedom fighters alive did any of your 
superiors mcfarlane or poindexter or the president or anyone else 
say to you ollie the boland amendment precludes you from engaging 
in these activities 
north never 
sullivan such as airstrips 
north never 
sullivan or shipping weapons or doing one thing or another 
north never 
sullivan never heard that 
north no sir not from the people i worked with none of 
the people i worked for ever told me that anything we did was 
illegal it was specifically done to avoid breaking the law 
sullivan did the president himself act to facilitate help for 
the freedom fighters for example by calling the presidents of 
foreign countries 
north yes sir 
sullivan now we have three ways you have talked about third 
countries project democracy the neighbors in the area and would 
there be a last one the private citizens in america such as mrs 
garwood that the jury met who would contribute to this effort 
north yes sir i was authorized to go and brief these 
people i was told specifically that i could not personally me 
ollie north ask them for money that i was a government official 
sullivan what did you understand that to mean colonel north 
north i understood that i wouldnt ask people for money and i 
didnt my role was simply to be one of explaining what the 
threat was to the united states but that i would not ever say 
now mrs jones or mrs smith or mr so and so would you 
please give money and i never did that 
sullivan you are accused in this case colonel north of 
conspiracy to commit a tax fraud did you do so 
north no sir i did not 
sullivan did you ever talk with any of the donors about their 
taxes or how they should give to get deductions 
north never 
sullivan with respect to these areas of activity did you 
regard or were you told that your activities in this area should be 
kept covert secret especially with respect to activities in 
central america and neighboring countries third country support 
north yes specifically the first one on third country 
particularly the financial support i was told never to reveal 
that to anybody the people i was dealing with were high 
level officials in those governments they had political opponents 
in their own governments and they had people trying to kill them 
from the communist side 
sullivan now sir focusing on the time period in which you are 
involved with these four aspects of work to support the freedom 
fighters did you have an operational account which you used in the 
nsc 
north yes i got approval from mr mcfarlane in person to 
set up a fund that i could dispense to support resistance leaders 
when they came to the united states eventually that was 
broadened to include a hostage recovery initiative and it was to 
remain very secret 
sullivan and over the course of running this special mission 
for hostage release would you have expended several tens of 
thousands of dollars out of the operational fund 
north certainly that yes sir 
sullivan colonel north approximately how many people over the 
years would you have paid out of the operational fund that you 
maintained in the office 
north the total number of people that who had i dont 
want to use the word paid because that isnt accurate who had 
their expenses reimbursed or who were paid would probably be in 
excess of 40 people 
sullivan did you yourself have reimbursements of expenses out 
of these funds 
north yes sir i did 
sullivan would you explain to the jury how that worked 
north there were times when i would do things that it was 
not either appropriate or timely or secret to bill it back through 
the government the travelers checks that i signed and that 
ive been charged with were when i wrote those travelers checks 
that was my money it was my money because i had reimbursed myself 
for expenses i had out of my own pocket

aliens denied political asylum at the border 
could be summarily excluded from the country without a formal 
hearing under a proposal being studied in the justice department 
the legislative proposal drafted by the immigration and 
naturalization service would eliminate the complicated series of 
administrative hearings that aliens are afforded if they are denied 
political asylum by the ins 
under the proposal which an official stressed was in the 
early stage of review a specially trained ins officer would hold 
an informal hearing to consider an aliens claim for political 
asylum 
the alien could be excluded from the country without being given 
an opportunity to press the political asylum claim before an ins 
district director or an immigration judge 
the proposal being circulated in the justice department would 
provide for summary exclusion of aliens who seek asylum at ports 
of entry who fail to make a credible showing of eligibility 
according to an internal analysis of the plan 
this should discourage those who are claiming asylum but in 
fact have no legitimate right to this status from attempting to 
enter the united states under this claim according to the 
document 
this would be a very serious attack on asylum said arthur 
c helton director of the political asylum project of the 
nonprofit lawyers committee for human rights in new york city i 
think this would obliterate fairness and due process for most 
asylum seekers 
such a proposal would affect thousands of people arriving at 
the border each year seeking political asylum from persecution in 
their homelands he said thursday 
to qualify for asylum aliens must demonstrate a wellfounded 
fear of persecution in their homeland or show evidence of past 
persecution 
ins contends that the lengthy hearing and appeal process in the 
law is abused by aliens who dont have valid claims 
congress would have to approve any change in immigration law 
that is ultimately proposed by the justice department 
the ins proposal was drafted in the wake of problems in south 
texas where as many as 5000 central americans a month have sought 
asylum since last june 
most were denied asylum and more than 4000 are being detained 
in ins facilities in texas awaiting the outcome of hearings on 
their claims of political persecution 
most of the refugees have been found ineligible for political 
asylum on the ground they are seeking to enter the country to 
escape poverty rather than persecution a quest for economic 
opportunity is not a basis for political asylum 
gregory j leo director of legislative affairs for ins said 
the proposal was in an early stage of review 
it has received no clearance at any level he said it is 
more or less a place to start the discussion 
it was drafted as a possible solution to the misuse or abuse 
of the asylum process leo said there are people who would use 
the asylum process as a means of staying here even though they are 
not qualified 
under the draft proposal the ins examiners decision would be 
final unless the attorney general or the ins commissioner decided 
to admit the alien 
the present system allows an alien to make successive 
applications to the district ins director and to an immigration 
judge leading to a timeconsuming process the departments 
analysis says 
if the immigration judge rules against an alien the decision 
may be appealed to the board of immigration appeals and then to 
federal circuit courts of appeals 
the existing procedure could enable an alien to remain in this 
country for months perhaps several years before being denied 
asylum status 
in the 1988 fiscal year 60000 people sought asylum and if 
current rates continue the total for the current year will be more 
than 100000 helton said 
another provision of the ins plan would increase by 5000 the 
number of refugee visas that could be granted to central americans 
in the current fiscal year the current limit for the fiscal year 
is 3500 
this feature is designed to encourage central americans to apply 
for refugee status at us embassies in the region 
people seeking refugee status must make their applications 
overseas at us embassies or consulates an alien must be in this 
country to seek political asylum 
the proposal would also abolish the right of an alien to be 
represented by an attorney when pressing an asylum claim such a 
right exists now in immigration court but at the informal hearing 
attorneys could only advise their clients not present evidence or 
speak on their behalf 
the ins plan would also sharply limit the opportunities for 
aliens to apply for asylum aliens would generally be required to 
file a notice within two weeks of being placed in deportation 
proceedings of their intention to seek asylum the application 
would be due in another 30 days 
asylum applications can now be filed virtually at any time 
during a deportation proceeding

1 in 1983 dci director of central intelligence casey asked 
secretary of defense weinberger if the department of defense could 
obtain infantry weapons that israel had confiscated from plo 
forces following discussions between major general meron of israel 
and retired major general richard secord of the united states 
government israel secretly provided several hundred tons of 
weapons to the dod on a grant basis in may 1983 this was known as 
operation tipped kettle in february 1984 the cia again asked 
dod if it could obtain additional plo weapons from israel at little 
or no cost for cia operational use after negotiations between 
march 1984 and july 1984 israel secretly provided the additional 
weapons to dod in operation tipped kettle ii the dod then 
transferred the weapons to the cia although cia advised congress 
that the weapons would be used for various purposes in fact many 
of them were provided to the nicaraguan resistance as appropriated 
funds ran out 
the effort to funnel materiel to the contras at a time when 
there were limits on the amount of funds the usg could spend to 
support the resistance also found expression in 1984 in project 
elephant herd under which the cia was to stockpile weapons and 
materiel provided by dod at the lowest possible cost under the 
economy act

2 in late march 1984 national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane suggested that he pursue funding alternatives for the 
nicaraguan resistance for use after congressional funding ran 
out 
4 in early 1984 in a discussion with the ambassador from saudi 
arabia mcfarlane encouraged that country to support the 
resistance a short time later the ambassador informed mcfarlane 
that his government would contribute 1 million per month the 
money became available during the early summer of 1984 
5 on june 25 1984 the national security planning group 
nspg including president reagan vice president bush 
secretary of state shultz secretary of defense weinberger dci 
director of central intelligence casey un ambassador 
kirkpatrick cjcs chairman of the joint chiefs of staff vessey 
admiral moreau counselor to the president meese mcfarlane and 
admiral poindexter among others discussed third country funding 
for the resistance 
7 at a meeting in midjuly 1984 between dci casey deputy dci 
john mcmahon and deputy secretary of state dam casey indicated 
that those present ought to get moving on nonusg us government 
funding for the resistance since attorney general smith had 
recently concluded that raising the funds in this manner would not 
be an impeachable offense as had been suggested at the nspg 
meeting on june 25 1984 
16 in early 1985 president reagan urged the head of state of 
saudi arabia to continue its support for the resistance saudi 
arabia subsequently made a contribution of more than 25 million 
 
20 in midapril 1985 lt col north advised mcfarlane that the 
resistance had received a total of 245 million since appropriated 
funds had run out of which more than 17 million had gone for 
arms munitions combat operations and combat support activities 
 
22 in early august 1985 the white house and various cia 
stations learned of reports that during the visit of david kimche 
to the us in may 1985 he had met with michael armacost the us 
undersecretary for political affairs and had negotiated the 
continuation of military aid from israel to central america 
32 in midmay 1986 donald fortier the director of 
politicalmilitary affairs at the nsc was advised that the 
situation for the resistance was bleak president reagan needed to 
pursue means of obtaining additional aid promptly including 
talking personally to heads of state to tell them that he was 
dispatching a special emissary with his personal request for their 
assistance to the resistance

42 in early july 1984 a cia officer reported to cia 
headquarters that honduras was taking the position that it would 
continue to support the resistance following the us funding 
cutoff but resistance operations would have to be covert to avoid 
political embarrassment to honduras 
43 in midaugust 1984 poindexter discussed with president 
reagan and others a proposal ascribed to secretary shultz that 
would permit congress to wink at lethal support for the 
resistance under shultzs plan the us government would supply 
nonlethal aid directly to the resistance the us government 
would provide military aid to el salvador which in turn would 
provide lethal aid to the resistance 
53 on february 19 1985 mcfarlane sent a memorandum to 
president reagan informing him of the recommendation of the cppg 
crisis preplanning group to provide incentives to honduras so 
that it would maintain its aid to the resistance it further 
recommended a presidential letter to the leader of honduras to be 
delivered by an emissary who would very privately explain us 
criteria for the expedited economic support security assistance 
deliveries and other support president reagan personally 
authorized the entire plan 
54 later in february 1985 president reagan sent the 
agreedupon message to honduran president suazo via the us 
ambassador the letter urged that honduras do all in its power to 
support those who struggle for freedom and democracy shortly 
thereafter mcfarlane sent a memorandum to shultz weinberger 
casey and vessey informing them that president reagans letter had 
been sent and proposing steps to be taken to implement the 
presidents intent the memorandum requested dod department of 
defense to commence expedited delivery of military items as 
previously planned and personally authorized by president reagan 
and it requested necessary documentation to enhance other support 
programs in honduras 
58 when vice president bush met with president suazo bush told 
suazo that president reagan had directed expedited delivery of us 
military items to honduras vice president bush also informed suazo 
that president reagan had directed that currently withheld economic 
assistance for honduras should be released that the united states 
would provide from its own military stocks critical security 
assistance items that had been ordered by honduran armed forces 
and that several security programs under way for honduran security 
forces would be enhanced

a house subcommittees vote to authorize 
construction of the 46 billion super collider marks an important 
first step toward starting the massive physics project and already 
several lawmakers promise the rest of the way wont be smooth 
the house subcommittee on energy and research development voted 
thursday to spend 250 million on the texasbased project in next 
years budget 
but panel chairwoman marilyn lloyd dtenn said the full 
committee on science space and technology must still approve the 
project 
ms lloyds subcommittee approved the energy departments energy 
research and development budget with no debate on the collider 
agreeing with president bushs request for 160 million for initial 
construction of the project and 90 million for research and 
development 
financing the super collider at the 250 million level however 
means deep cuts will have to be made in other energy research 
projects said rep harris w fawell rill and the shape of 
those reductions will influence his support of the superconducting 
super collider 
rep howard wolpe dmich issued a statement saying he and 
rep paul b henry rmich had reservations about the site 
selection process and the magnitude of the project 
in their joint statement the michigan congressmen said they 
believe that the magnitude of contemplated national expenditure 
combined with unresolved questions of procedure and substance on 
the site selection process demands further review before 
recommending authorization for continued work on the project 
the men said they were concerned cost estimates on building the 
collider have escalated dramatically since our last consideration 
of the issue 
scientists hope the 53mile underground tunnel will help them 
understand more about the fundamental nature of matter 
because of such unresolved questions as whether the doe made its 
preliminary choice of texas for the project before the receipt of 
data from finalist states it is therefore impossible to come to 
the final conclusion as to the appropriateness of the site 
selection procedure the two michigan congressmen said

reagan call president suazo to make clear that the executive branch 
was determined to maintain pressure on the sandinistas during the 
call between the two leaders suazo urged that the us government 
continue to oppose communism president reagans personal notes of 
his telephone call reflect that president suazo told president

97 in late august 1986 north reported to admiral poindexter 
that a representative of panamanian leader manuel noriega had asked 
north to meet with him noriegas representative proposed that in 
exchange for a promise from the usg to help clean up noriegas 
image and a commitment to lift the usg ban on military sales to the 
panamanian defense forces noriega would assassinate the sandinista 
leadership for the us government north had told noriegas 
representative that us law forbade such actions the 
representative responded that noriega had numerous assets in place 
in nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as 
noriega had helped the usg the previous year in blowing up a 
sandinista arsenal 
98 north advised admiral poindexter that the british persons 
who had run the operation against the arsenal had used a panamanian 
civilian ordnance expert north noted that noriega had the 
capabilities that he had proffered and that the cost of any 
operations could be borne by project democracy 
99 admiral poindexter responded that if noriega had assets 
inside nicaragua he could be helpful the usg could not be 
involved in assassination but panamanian assistance with sabotage 
would be another story admiral poindexter recommended that north 
speak with noriega directly 
106 in late september 1986 lt col north reported to admiral

a former nato commander wants to reduce the 
alliances active conventional forces by 50 percent with the 
warsaw pact cutting its strength to the same number of troops 
calling natos current proposal only a starting point for 
negotiations with the warsaw pact nations retired army gen andrew 
j goodpaster on thursday told the senate armed services committee 
his plan amounts to a radical restructuring on both sides 
the current nato proposal calls for a 5 percent to 10 percent 
cut in battle tanks heavy artillery and armored troop carriers 
the offer came in response to soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
proposal last december to cut the red army by 10 percent with a 
reduction of 5000 tanks and 50000 troops in eastern europe 
i do not think the interests of the west would be served if 
thats as far as we went said goodpaster who served as supreme 
allied commander in europe from 1968 to 1969 
goodpaster 74 said his proposal calls for parity with total 
active forces on each side at no more than 50 percent of present 
nato strength 
the proposal surprised the members of the senate armed services 
panel with chairman sam nunn dga interrupting goodpasters 
testimony to clarify what the retired general had suggested 
do you think its a mistake to focus in isolation on the 
current nato proposal nunn asked 
i do indeed responded goodpaster the onetime aide to 
former president eisenhower who helped him organize natos military 
arm in the early 1950s 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
committee described goodpasters proposal as history in the 
making a bold initiative nunn called the plan a bold 
proposal 
after the hearing nunn said goodpasters plan coming from a 
stalwart supporter of the alliance would cause a considerable 
stir 
goodpaster is telling nato officials get your thinking caps 
on nunn said 
goodpaster is chairman of the atlantic council of the united 
states a nato support group 
the panel also heard from phillip a karber a defense 
consultant with a subsidiary of the ford aerospace co who argued 
against 50 percent reductions in nato forces and stan sloan a 
former cia analyst on nato affairs who serves as a senior 
specialist in international security 
sloan told the committee that french officials had expressed 
concerns about natos proposed cuts and favored unilateral 
reductions if there had to be any agreement 
meanwhile house armed services chairman rep les aspin 
dwis said nato should accept the warsaw pacts offer and stop 
refusing to include aircraft in the first round of negotiations 
we should take a leaf from mikhail gorbachevs book and accept 
our opponents first offer aspin told an audience in the hague 
netherlands it would do us more good militarily and politically 
than if we prevailed with natos goslow position 
aspin has criticized natos position since negotiations began 
last month in vienna between moscow and the warsaw pact nations and 
nato

oliver norths decision to testify in his 
trial also means he must turn over his notebooks which prosecutors 
may use to prove north shredded documents during the irancontra 
affair 
we are prepared to produce the notebooks north attorney 
barry simon said toward the close of thursdays court session the 
notebooks cover the period from october 1984 to nov 25 1986 the 
day north was fired from the national security council 
norths decision to take the stand takes away any privilege he 
may have to refuse to produce documents in his possession 
us district judge gerhard gesell had ruled earlier in the 
north trial that he didnt have to surrender his notebooks based 
on his constitutional right against selfincrimination 
at a hearing jan 25 simon suggested that prosecutors might try 
to use the notebooks in the portion of the case alleging 
destruction of documents by north in november 1986 as the 
irancontra affair was unfolding 
in arguing against production of the notebooks simon said 
prosecutors might try to link references in the notebooks to 
documents that north allegedly destroyed before leaving the nsc 
north made daily entries in the spiralbound notebooks while he 
worked at the national security council the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh obtained a subpoena for them march 3 and now 
wants that subpoena enforced 
simon wants to limit the use of the notebooks to those entries 
around the time periods of the alleged crimes north is accused of 
committing gesell said some of the entries may be classified 
material and should be censored 
the judge said he would issue an order today addressing those 
questions 
portions of the notebooks that were turned over earlier to 
congress and have been made public contain a wealth of information 
one charge against north is that he obstructed congress by 
helping prepare a false chronology that said no us official 
learned before january 1986 that hawk missiles had been shipped to 
iran in november 1985 
the notebooks show norths participation in helping arrange the 
shipment 
in notebook entries for nov 20 1985 north detailed a plan for 
transporting the hawks to iran in exchange for a fourphase release 
of hostages several days later the shipment was made aboard a 
ciacontrolled airline 
norths notebooks confirm contra leader adolfo calero consulted 
with him on weapons needs and purchases 
norths notebooks describe successful efforts in obtaining false 
certificates from guatemalan officials stating that arms which were 
in fact destined for the contras were for the exclusive use of the 
central american country to which they were being sent the false 
certificates enabled one of norths codefendants richard secord 
to ship more than 90000 pounds of east european munitions by 
chartered aircraft from a european arms dealer to the contras

allegations cheng could have been sentenced to death if convicted 
of sedition 
in addition to advocating independence for taiwan cheng also 
had published articles that called for a new constitution for this 
island officials said 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war in china continue to maintain they are the legitimate 
government of all china and that taiwan is a chinese province 
both taiwan and china are opposed to an independent taiwan and 
china has indicated it would use force to prevent the establishment

panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega met 
with oliver north in 1986 and offered to sabotage nicaraguan 
targets including an airport and oil refineries according to 
evidence presented at norths trial 
the information is contained in a us government admission of 
facts focusing on the reagan administrations secret assistance 
to the contra rebels at a time when congress had cut off military 
aid to the rebel force 
in late september 1986 north reported to his boss 
thennational security adviser john poindexter on his london 
meeting with noriega said a portion of the 42page admission 
noriega would try to take immediate actions against the 
sandinistas and offered a list of priorities including an oil 
refinery an airport and the puerto sandino offload facility 
said the admission 
in late august according to the admission north told 
poindexter that a representative of noriega had said the panamanian 
leader would assassinate the sandinista leadership for the us 
government 
a panamanian military spokesman on thursday denied the 
allegations maj edgardo lopez called them another cockandbull 
story of the united states to continue strangling the panamanian 
people and intensify its defamation campaign against the chief of 
our defense forces 
according to the court document the assassination offer came 
in exchange for a promise from the usg us government to help 
clean up noriegas image and a commitment to lift the usg ban on 
military sales to the panamanian defense forces 
north told the representative that us law forbade 
assassinations of foreign leaders and the representative responded 
by saying noriega could accomplish many essential things 
noriega said the representative had helped the usg the 
previous year in blowing up a sandinista arsenal said the 
admission of facts 
british individuals who had run the operation against the 
arsenal had used a panamanian civilian ordnance expert north told 
poindexter according to the admission 
north told poindexter that the cost of any operations could be 
borne by project democracy the covert private aid network that 
north had set up with richard secord and albert hakim now 
codefendants in the irancontra case 
poindexter responded that if noriega had assets in nicaragua he 
could be helpful the national security adviser also said that the 
us government could not be involved in assassination but 
panamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story 
according to the admission 
both the prosecution and norths lawyers have agreed to the 
wording in the admission of facts the document was assembled to 
avoid a protracted legal battle over classified information which 
norths lawyers want to present in his defense 
the admission is a summary of highly sensitive classified 
material which the government refuses to allow into the courtroom

a 10day strike called by tribal 
militants demanding autonomy in the northeastern state of assam has 
left at least 16 people dead and 35 injured according to news 
reports 
since the strike began march 27 there have been 25 cases of 
arson 31 attacks on police patrols and 25 bombings united news of 
india said thursday 
the agency said disrupted transportation services had cost the 
government nearly 15 million in lost freight charges 
passenger rail services in the region about 1000 miles east of 
new delhi resumed thursday after a 10day suspension 
those killed in the violence included an army doctor and four 
police officers united news said the agency said 25 police 
officers were injured in bomb blasts and ambushes 
the bodo tribespeople are demanding a separate homeland on the 
northern bank of the brahmaputra river in assam a remote hilly 
state bordering bangladesh and bhutan 
the proposed bodoland would cover about onethird of assams 
territory of 24512 square miles most of which is prime forest and 
cultivable land 
the bodos mostly farmers were animists before they converted 
to hinduism and christianity earlier this century they make up 
about 30 percent of assams 20 million people 
the government has refused to consider their demand for a 
separate state bodos say that migration to their traditional 
homelands by nontribal people has reduced farm sizes causing 
economic and social turmoil 
migration has been an issue for more than 20 years but there 
were few reports of violence until about two years ago 
bodo militants have called for more strikes the next one is set 
for april 18 and is to last for 20 days 
according to government figures at least 114 people have been 
killed in separatist violence since february 
most of the victims have been nontribal villagers in the

consumers took out 422 billion more in debt 
than they paid off in february in the latest sign that the american 
economy may be slowing down 
the federal reserve board report thursday was the slowest pace 
of growth for the consumer debt in four months down from the 437 
billion rise in january and the smallest monthly gain since 
octobers 391 billion increase 
analysts said the restrained growth in debt indicates consumers 
may be becoming more cautious about their buying plans and is in 
line with other signs that the economy is slowing down in the 
seventh year of its record peacetime expansion 
it doesnt suggest any great retrenchment by consumers but it 
does indicate somewhat more caution said economist cynthia latta 
of data resources inc in lexington mass its consistent with 
this gradually accumulating evidence that the economy is beginning 
to cool off 
the gain in auto loans was slightly smaller than in january 
rising 21 billion in february after a 213 billion increase the 
month before

two democrats are trying to mandate 
presidential debates for candidates seeking government campaign 
dollars 
if presidential candidates are going to continue to take 100 
million from taxpayers to run their campaigns then there ought to 
be some assurance that they will stand up on stage face their 
opponent and engage in a true discussion of the issues said rep 
edward j markey dmass 
markey and sen bob graham dfla introduced legislation 
thursday that would require candidates who are eligible to receive 
public funds in the general election campaign to agree in writing 
to participate in at least four 90minute debates the vice 
presidential nominees would be required to engage in at least one 
debate 
under the proposal the debates would be sponsored by 
nonpartisan organizations and held in september and october at 
least 30 minutes of each 90minute debate would be devoted to 
questions and answers or candidatetocandidate exchanges 
the federal election commission would determine whether 
candidates are responsible for failing to comply

two human rights experts affiliated with 
the united nations say moscow is ready to sign an accord allowing 
soviet citizens to take complaints of rights abuses directly to 
international investigators 
soviets would be able to bring cases against their government 
involving allegations of torture inhumane or degrading treatment 
forced labor arbitrary arrest or detention and restrictions on 
emigration among other abuses 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the general assembly in 
december that human rights should be given new emphasis in 
international affairs and this would be in line with that policy 
the soviet union intends to sign the optional protocol to the 
international covenant on civil and political rights rights 
officials said thursday 
rajsoomer lallah of mauritius chairman of the human rights 
committee and fausto pocar of italy another committee officer 
told reporters the notice was unofficial and the soviets had not 
specified when the protocol will be signed 
their committee is an international body of unaffiliated 
legal experts with the power to order compensation 
pocar said he received the soviet assurances while in moscow in 
november 
lallah said he also received unofficial confirmation from 
moscow and noted in october we are going to examine the third 
periodic human rights report of the ussr and it is possible 
that by then the decision will have been taken or in process of 
being taken 
the soviet union said last month it would accept world court 
jurisdiction in cases brought under the covenant on civil and 
political rights and five other human rights treaties 
the international covenant on civil and political rights 
guarantees the individuals right to life freedom from torture 
inhuman or degrading treatment freedom from slavery forced labor 
freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention freedom of movement 
freedom of thought conscience peaceful assembly and free 
association among other provisions 
however individuals do not have the right to approach the world 
court with allegations of rights violations only governments 
by signing the optional protocol moscow will be granting its 
citizens the right to appeal directly to the human rights committee 
hungary ratified the protocol last year joining 40 other 
nations that recognize it 
pocar and lallah are two of the 18 human rights experts who 
conclude a threeweek session of the human rights committee today 
the experts examined human rights reports filed by uruguay the 
philippines togo and new zealand 
soviet acceptance of outside scrutiny of its human rights 
practices should help moscows campaign to be host city for a human 
rights conference in 1991 
in january washington changed its position and said it would 
accept a moscow conference citing the soviet release of political 
prisoners easing of emigration and more tolerant views on free 
speech and freedom of religion

could reverse or severely limit the high courts 1973 roe vs wade

send an important message that a majority of people in this 
country are pro choice said mimi grinker a spokesman for 
planned parenthood of new york city

train and 10 buses to carry demonstrators to washington the new

the late rock hudsons lover may accept less 
than the 2175 million a jury awarded him in the landmark aids 
case his attorney said 
marc christian would be inclined to accept a reduction as long 
as it doesnt go below 9 million in actual damages and 3 million 
in punitive damages said his lawyer harold rhoden 
its important to preserve the message that was sent rhoden 
said and to do that we must preserve the punitive damages 
the case was to return to court today in the wake of sexual 
accusations and lie detector tests and rhoden said he would not be 
surprised if superior court judge bruce geernaert reduced the award 
im going to ask him to let the verdict stand but ive got to 
concede he probably wont rhoden said thursday 
the attorney for the hudson estate james parker mills said 
thursday he wants a new trial citing new evidence from a man who 
claims he had sex with christian after his lawsuit was filed 
that man gunther fraulob took a polygraph exam and passed 
mills said but rhoden said christian who adamantly denies having 
sex with fraulob also passed a lie detector test 
christian who won his huge judgment against the hudson estate 
because the actor failed to tell him he had aids contended he was 
so traumatized by learning about it that he has remained celibate 
ever since fraulob said they had sex shortly after christian filed 
his lawsuit in november 1985 
neither mans lie detector test is admissible in court 
christian 35 has maintained that he lived in fear of 
developing aids after learning of hudsons affliction shortly 
before the actor died 
the jury found that hudson engaged in outrageous conduct by 
concealing from christian that he had aids the jurors who had 
heard seven weeks of often lurid testimony about the dead stars 
sex life said in separate verdicts on feb 15 and feb 17 that 
christian should receive 145 million in actual damages and 725 
million in punitive damages 
christians case is seen as precedentsetting because he did not 
develop aids and has tested negative for the disease in previous 
lawsuits only those who contracted a sexually transmitted disease 
were able to win damages 
hudsons estate and his personal secretary mark miller were 
codefendants in the civil lawsuir only millers was named in the 
second phase for punitive and exemplary damages because state law 
prohibits such damages being awarded from an estate 
compensatory damages are intended to compensate for loss of 
income pain and suffering and actual damages punitive damages are 
intended to punish while exemplary damages would set an example 
for others 
hudson 58 the handsome leading man in such movies as pillow 
talk and giant died on oct 5 1985 three months after the 
public learned that he had the disease

leading the 101member nonaligned 
movement in a scathing denunciation of the top un official in 
namibia black african nations have asked the world body to send 
7500 peacekeepers to the territory 
they accused the world body thursday of contributing to the 
fighting in namibia by being wholly unprepared to assume its 
responsibilities of protecting the population and containing 
south african forces 
the security council meanwhile scheduled private consultations 
this afternoon on namibia 
namibian officials say at least 252 guerrillas of the southwest 
africa peoples organization have been killed this week in combat 
along with 24 members of the south africanled security forces 
the violence has threatened the unsponsored plan for the 
territorys independence 
un investigators in the field have concluded up to 1000 swapo 
guerrillas crossed the angolan border into namibia last weekend 
sparking bloody reprisals by namibian territorial police 
the coordinating bureau of the nonaligned movement a committee 
that meets in new york and consists of un diplomats from 101 
countries severely criticized martti ahtisaari the uns special 
representative for namibia 
the nonaligned nations were outraged to note that the murder 
squads of battalion 101 and koevoet were operating with the full 
authority of the special representative of the united nations 
secretarygeneral mr martti ahtisaari said a communique from 
the group 
the bureau judged mr ahtisaaris action to be illconceived 
and a violation of security council resolution 435 1978 the 
un plan for namibias independence 
south african troops of battalion 101 were supposed to be 
confined to barracks under un independence transition plans for 
namibia but they were allowed to reinforce security forces after 
fighting broke out 
koevoet the afrikaans word for crowbar is the name of a 
special unit of black namibian policemen commanded mainly by white 
south african officers 
the bureau called upon the secretarygeneral of the united 
nations to confine the south african forces to their bases without 
delay in compliance with resolution 435 and to effect the immediate 
full deployment of the 7500 military observer component of untag 
in namibia in order to ensure free and fair elections without 
intimidation the statement said 
furthermore the bureau expressed concern at the poor judgment 
shown by the special representative of the secretarygeneral in his 
handling of the present crisis in namibia and called on the 
secretarygeneral to ensure that the same does not happen in 
future said the nonaligned communique 
the security council authorized 4650 military observers for 
untag but said it could deploy up to 7500 soldiers if necessary 
the nonaligned countries called on the united nations to let 
the swapo guerrillas battling the namibian territorial police be 
confined to bases in namibia on the same basis that 1500 south 
african troops are to be confined to barracks in the country 
the size and cost of the namibia operation has been a 
contentious issue since december when the nonaligned nations 
sought 7500 peacekeepers at a cost of up to 700 million annually 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
soviet union britain france and china sought a reduced force 
that would cost less 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar recommended a 
compromise in which 4650 military observers were dispatched but 
up to 7500 could be authorized if needed that plan was budgeted 
at 416 million 
the nonaligned nations said that was too few peacekeepers and 
the dispute delayed the dispatch of the force about 920 
peacekeepers are in namibia

the government says it will abolish a 42yearold 
law that guarantees jobs to nearly 10000 british dockworkers but 
labor leaders say they will paralyze the countrys ports with 
strikes to block the change 
employment secretary norman fowler told the house of commons on 
thursday that the national dock labor scheme was an anachronism 
as long as the scheme continues to operate it will remain the 
biggest obstacle to a modern and efficient ports industry he 
said 
a total of 1700 dockworkers immediately walked off the job 
thursday at tilbury east of london in protest 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative administration 
which has sharply restricted trade union powers plans to write a 
parliamentary bill to abolish the law by july 
the bill is guaranteed passage through parliament because of the 
coservative majority in the house of commons 
the current law regulates employment conditions in the 46 ports 
it covers it guarantees jobs to 9400 dockworkers there by 
ensuring staff levels can be cut only when workers quit voluntarily 
even an employee who loses a job when his or her employer goes 
out of business is guaranteed a job with another employer 
to soften the change the government has agreed to pay about 
59500 to each of the 1000 dockworkers expected to lose their 
jobs when the new law goes into effect 
the 13 millionmember transport and general workers union 
represents most of the 9400 dockworkers involved the unions 
docks officer john connally predicted a nationwide strike would 
be called to protest the scheme 
britain has another 29 newer ports that employ 4000 dockworkers 
who are not covered by the national dock labor scheme but connally 
said he believed they would also walk off the job in sympathy

the khmer rouge today denounced 
vietnams plan to withdraw troops from cambodia and called instead 
for a pullout supervised by the united nations 
resistance leaders also expressed doubt vietnam would honor its 
pledge to remove its remaining 50000 to 70000 troops from 
cambodia by sept 30 
vietnamese troops entered cambodia in december 1978 and ousted 
the communist khmer rouge under whose rule an estimated onefourth 
of cambodias 8 million people died from famine and execution since 
1975 
but the clandestine khmer rouge radio in its first public 
statement on vietnams withdrawal plan said the entire cambodian 
people absolutely cannot accept the announcement of a unilateral 
troop pullout of the hanoi vietnamese aggressors 
the broadcast monitored in bangkok also denounced vietnams 
proposal that india canada and poland oversee the withdrawal along 
with a representative of un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
resistance officials oppose vietnams choices for the monitoring 
force because of polands ties to the soviet union and indias 
recognition of the vietnambacked government in cambodia 
without genuine supervision by the united nations there would 
be no genuine withdrawal of vietnamese troops the radio said 
china the main arms suppliers to the cambodian resistance also 
has insisted that any monitoring force be established by the united 
nations and not vietnam 
the khmer rouge is the strongest of the three groups in the 
resistance coalition headed by prince norodom sihanouk fears that 
the khmer rouge would regain power has been a major stumbling block 
to a settlement of the political crisis brought on by vietnams 
military presence 
on thursday vietnams official hanoi radio reaffirmed that it 
would withdraw its troops by sept 30 deadline and urged the 
international community to prevent the brutal khmer rouge regime 
from regaining power 
vietnams occupation of cambodia has been a major stumbling 
block to establishing relations with the united states in the wake 
of the vietnam war and improving economic ties with noncommunist 
southeast asian nations 
china also has refused to resume normal relations with the 
soviet union as long as vietnamese troops remain soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev is to visit china next month for the first 
chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
in the statement the khmer rouge accused hanoi of announcing 
the unilateral withdrawal to avoid un supervision so it could 
secretly maintain troops in cambodia 
the statement attributed to khmer rouge leader khieu samphan 
said the move also was aimed at maintaining the provietnamese 
cambodian administration of prime minister hun sen 
resistance groups have called for disbanding the phnom penh 
government and establishing a fourparty coalition administration 
under sihanouk that would include hun sens followers 
the khmer rouge in its statement also called for the 
fourparty coalition government 
in a written statement issued thursday in beijing sihanouk the 
former cambodian ruler rejected all decisions all conditions 
and all accords announced by vietnam regarding cambodia 
he urged vietnam to pull out of cambodia as soon as possible 
under supervision of the united nations which would supervise new 
elections 
indonesia meanwhile said it would sponsor a meeting between 
sihanouk and cambodias vietnambacked prime minister hun sen 
next month a spokeswoman for sihanouk said he planned to meet with

former first lady nancy reagans antidrug 
crusade took her to a latenight police raid on a suspected cocaine 
rock house an experience she found very depressing 
i was able to see them busting in said mrs reagan who 
wore a blue police windbreaker and running shoes to the thursday 
night raid i always see the other end kids who are in 
rehabilitation 
police chief daryl gates who brought mrs reagan to the raid 
said she had expressed an interest previously in going on a drug 
bust but was unable to do so as first lady because of security 
concerns 
the raid took place in the citys beleaguered south central 
section where gangs such as the crips and bloods wage war on each 
other often using semiautomatic weapons such as the ak47 to carry 
out their vendettas 
police arrested 14 people and seized a small quantity of what 
they believed to be crystalline rock cocaine as mrs reagan 
watched earlier in the evening police said she witnessed 
undercover officers making drug purchases 
its awful to see when you think that these people have no 
lives its very sad she said remarking on the arrests and the 
houses sparse furnishings 
gates said the house was called a rock house and a smoke 
house because drug users would use it as a location for smoking 
cocaine the name is derived from the crystalline rocks of 
cocaine peddled and from the fortifications which are often 
installed in such homes by drug dealers 
we gave her the opportunity to see what the dope trade is 
about gates said she was right there when the swat team went 
in 
she did not talk to any of those arrested but one of them said 
hello mrs reagan 
now its too late for them she said what a waste what

a philippines court has cleared the 
way for the trial of more than a dozen lawsuits aimed at recovering 
billions of dollars allegedly stolen by former president ferdinand 
marcos and his wife imelda 
in a decision made thursday and released today the philippines 
antigraft court said the couple had repeatedly ignored summonses 
to answer the civil suits the court also rejected claims that 
marcos was too ill to respond to the allegations 
in new york however us attorneys agreed thursday to 
temporarily separate marcos from its 345 million racketeering case 
because they said he was in too poor of health to stand trial 
anytime soon 
the us governments action means only the case against imelda 
marcos and others will proceed for now 
the decision by the philippines court clears the way for at 
least 13 civil suits to go to trial they are among 40 suits filed 
by the government in july 1987 against marcos his wife and about 
300 associates to recover up to 10 billion they allegedly 
plundered during his 20year rule 
the suits claim a total 112 billion dollars in damages 
thursdays ruling means the trial can proceed even if the 
marcoses are not represented by attorneys 
the marcoses have been living in honolulu since the february 
1986 civilianmilitary revolt that ended his rule and swept corazon 
aquino to power 
mrs aquino has refused to allow the marcoses to return for 
security reasons 
thursdays ruling noted repeated efforts by filipino officials 
to serve the summonses on the marcoses in honolulu it said all of 
the summonses were ignored and the couple was declared in default 
under philippine law defendants in civil suits who are outside 
the country may be served summonses at their last known address or 
through publication in a newspaper in that area a court may 
declare a defendant in default if he fails to answer the summons in 
60 days 
for the marcoses that deadline lapsed jan 9 the ruling noted 
the courts decision also said the claim that defendant 
ferdinand e marcos has been seriously ill and hospitalized several 
times as to make him incompetent to be put on notice is 
absolutely devoid of merit such a claim is incredible and has no 
legal bearing in the case at point 
marcos 71 is in guarded condition in hawaii at st francis 
medical center where he has been confined since jan 15 for 
treatment of heart and respiratory problems 
in new york the marcoses are accused of siphoning more than 
100 million from their homelands treasury and using the money to 
buy art and real estate mrs marcos has pleaded innocent and is 
free on 5 million bail

imelda marcos vowed to fight alone if 
necessary against federal racketeering charges after her ailing 
husband was temporarily severed from the case because of his poor 
health 
prosecutors conceded that former philippine president ferdinand 
e marcos is too ill to stand trial for now and agreed on thursday 
to separate him temporarily from the massive racketeering case 
but his wife who still faces trial in new york remained 
defiant 
i look forward to defending myself you dont have to be a 
doctor to see how sick the president is the former first lady 
told the associated press in honolulu if i have to face the 
court alone so be it i will walk into the courtroom with my head 
held high 
prosecutors wrote to the judge presiding over the case 
acknowledging that marcos health has deteriorated since a medical 
examination by a government doctor last fall 
based upon mr marcos repeated bouts of pneumonia and his 
susceptibility to other infection since january 1989 the 
government is no longer able to represent to the court that mr 
marcos is now able to stand trial assistant us attorney debra 
livingston wrote to us district judge john f keenan in a letter 
dated april 5 and disclosed thursday 
marcos 71 is in guarded condition at st francis medical 
center in honolulu where he has been confined since jan 15 for 
treatment of heart kidney and respiratory problems 
its about time and im not surprised said richard hibey a 
marcos lawyer in washington dc i think there is ample and 
uncontradicted medical evidence that he is in a grave and 
deteriorating physical condition from which he is not likely to 
survive 
marcos was examined during the weekend by francis weld a 
courtappointed physician from new york who examined marcos last 
october and determined that he was fit to travel to new york 
but according to ms livingstons letter after his latest 
examination weld concluded that marcos health had deteriorated 
the marcoses are accused of siphoning more than 100 million 
from their homelands treasury and using the money to buy art and 
real estate in new york mrs marcos has pleaded innocent and is 
free on 5 million bail posted by a friend tobacco heiress doris 
duke 
the marcoses eight associates including saudi arabian 
businessman adnan khashoggi and a california bank were indicted

suspicious city council members resisting the 
popularity and charm of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev have 
rejected a proposal to form a sistercity relationship with the 
soviet city of volgograd 
after a spirited threehour debate thursday the council voted 
98 against a proposal to establish formal cultural ties with 
volgograd formerly called stalingrad volgograd is 600 miles 
southeast of moscow 
councilman william boytchuk who is of ukrainian descent led 
the campaign against the proposal saying the soviets are not to be 
trusted 
do not be fooled by his colorful rhetoric and undeniable 
charm boytchuk said referring to gorbachev 
most of the 300 people who packed the city council chambers for 
thursdays debate seemed to agree boytchuk got thunderous applause 
from the audience when he said volgograd nyet nyet nyet 
but some city politicians were disappointed having hoped the 
move might foster international peace and understanding 
its a retrograde step in the pursuit of world peace said 
councilman jack layton it sends out a message that we still 
believe in the mentality of the cold war

japanese buyers drove bidding at an auction of 
famous signatures to more than 40000 for the late emperor 
hirohitos name on a simple courtesy letter proving you cant 
measure love an auctioneer said 
hands started coming up everywhere said herman darvick of 
the moment bidding began on the 1934 document that was expected to 
bring up to 3000 at an auction where abraham lincoln drew 1540 
and indira gandhi 1500 
bidders quickly boosted the value of what was described by 
herman darvick autograph auctions as an exceedingly rare early 
manuscript letter of state in japanese 
i was standing i could feel my knees buckling when it got 
past 20000 darvick said 
several bidders thursday kept their hands up right through the 
30000 point the gavel finally came down at 42000 to loud 
applause 
you can get a complete autograph collection of all the us 
presidents from washington to bush for under 42000 darvick 
said 
the auctioneers 10 percent commission at the sale at a 
manhattan hotel for 100 enthusiasts raised the price to 46200 
its going back to japan where it should be said darvick 
this is unique i cant think of any other autograph going 
like this one did he said adding that the enthusiasm seemed 
based on emotion rather than investment value 
darvick said he misjudged the nation of japan and their love 
for their emperor 
masayuki miyamoto who placed the winning bid on behalf of a 
japanese bank which was representing a client in japan declined to 
say anything about the buyer 
the letter was consigned by carmen mendieta garciavelez 
daughter of carlos mendieta y montefur to whom hirohito sent it 
after montefur was elected provisional president of the republic of 
cuba on jan 18 1934 
the letter signed boldly by hirohito and k hirota minister of 
foreign affairs said in part that the leaders send our sincere 
wishes for the personal success of your excellency in the same way 
for the prosperity of his nation 
hirohito who was buried feb 24 in an elaborate funeral was 
worshipped by his people as a living god and branded a war criminal 
in the later half of his 87year life 
norio murai a new york resident who was one of the last bidders 
to drop out said it was very rare for a signature of hirohito to 
come up at auction and would only occur outside japan 
if he writes a letter to people do you think somebody would 
put it up for auction people wouldnt think of it it would be a 
family treasure he said

the bush administration does not plan to 
modernize the nations surveillance satellites despite a promise 
last year by president reagan according to a report published 
today 
the new york times quoted the chairman of the senate 
intelligence committee sen david l boren dokla as saying 
failure to improve the satellites would seriously jeopardize 
the national security 
improving the satellites was a condition for last years senate 
approval of a treaty eliminating mediumrange missiles 
the times noted that the bush administration had presented its 
intention not to improve the satellites as a proposal not a 
final decision 
boren declined to discuss specifics of the program the times 
said but some experts described it as a multibillion dollar effort 
to provide more kh11 and lacrosse surveillance satellites as well 
as more personnel to analyze photographic and radar data 
the kh11 takes high resolution photographs and the lacrosse 
uses radar for surveillance at night and through clouds 
boren told the times that if the bush administration continues 
with the plan not to improve satellite surveillance it could 
greatly damage the presidents relationship with the senate 
boren chairman of the intelligence committee also said that if 
the administration fails to improve the system it would seriously 
jeopardize our own nearterm national security interests and could 
slow down completion of a strategic arms reduction treaty 
the senate intelligence committee last year extracted a promise 
that the surveillance system would be modernized after threatening 
to hold up approval of the treaty on intermediate range nuclear 
forces which bans medium and shortrange missiles on land 
the treaty was signed by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev at a moscow summit meeting in june 1988

the fired captain of the exxon tanker 
that crashed into an alaska reef and spilled more than 10 million 
gallons of oil was released from jail after posting drastically 
reduced bail of 25000 
justice thomas stark the supervising judge of suffolk county 
criminal court said thursday that the bond initially set at 1 
million for capt joseph hazelwood was unconstitutionally 
excessive 
he said there was little chance of hazelwood jumping bail and 
set it at the amount prosecutors originally had requested 
a stonefaced hazelwood who was allegedly drunk when the exxon 
valdez crashed into a reef on march 24 left the suffolk county 
jail thursday walked past reporters without comment and left in a 
car with his lawyers 
on wednesday state supreme court justice kenneth rohl set bail 
for hazelwood at 1 million bond or 500000 cash comparing the 
effect of the ships oil spill in alaska to the atomic bombing of 
hiroshima 
the amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of 
the crime or the effect of the crime on the community said stark 
after listening to an emotional appeal from hazelwood attorney 
thomas russo 
on march 24 hazelwood turned control of the valdez over to a 
third mate uncertified to pilot the vessel in the waters off 
alaska the ship hit a reef gushing crude oil into prince william 
sound 
hazelwood 42 faces three misdemeanor charges in alaska of 
operating a ship while intoxicated reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of oil the charges in the nations largest oil 
spill carry a combined maximum penalty of 2 years in prison and a 
10000 fine he has 30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing 
federal regulations prohibit commercial operators from having 
004 percent alcohol in their blood authorities said hazelwood had 
a 0061 percent level nine hours after the accident 
asked by investigators what was the problem hazelwood said i 
think youre looking at it according to a court affidavit 
hazelwood was fired by the exxon corp which bans alcohol on 
its ships the captain was twice arrested on drunken driving 
charges and his drivers license was suspended three times

castigating those who make cruel 
charges that brazil is destroying its vast jungle president jose 
sarney has announced a 350 million plan to protect its amazon rain 
forest 
our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage 
sarney said thursday in announcing a program called our nature 
which creates forest preserves and additional indian reservations 
and bans timber exports 
sarney criticized the alarmist tone of the international 
campaign and said satellite photos showed only 5 percent of 
brazils rain forest had been destroyed compared with estimates of 
up to 12 percent 
describing the 2 million square miles of rain forest as 
brazils sovereign patrimony he said brazilians are accused 
of something we cannot accept of destroying our own territory 
such charges of environmental destruction are cruel and unfair 
full of scientific falsehoods that misinform the world 
sarney said politicians scientists and ambassadors from 
neighboring south american countries attended the ceremony at the 
presidential palace 
ecologists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the 
greenhouse effect a warming trend that is warming the planet 
and affecting its weather but brazil has rebuffed proposals for 
foreign participation in conservation 
our nature which also establishes an environmental fund 
includes 17 presidential decrees and seven bills to be sent to 
congress 
among the measures are 
ending financial incentives for cattle ranching in the amazon 
seen as the single greatest factor in destruction of the rain 
forest world bank figures say the 197586 investment in ranching 
exceeded 1 billion 
government control of mercury which is used by gold miners in 
the amazon and has become a major source of water pollution the 
government also would rehabilitate areas damaged by mining 
creation of a special forest police force to control fires set 
by ranchers and farmers to clear jungle land to be aided by the 
armed forces and satellite photos 
mapping agroecological zones to determine which parts of 
the amazon can be developed without environmental damage aided by 
the un food and agriculture organization 
sarney said the goal is a permanent and economically viable 
development program ecologically adequate politically balanced 
and socially just 
brazil has set aside 124000 square miles of land in the past 
four years for its 220000 native indians he said and reserving 
another 160000 is under study 
the president said our nature would cost brazil 350 million 
in the first two years and the government would welcome help from 
abroad but we will not accept tutelage he said 
our doors are open to cooperation from the world but without 
conditions he declared 
as he has before sarney rejected proposals to trade part of 
brazils 115 billion foreign debt for investment in conservation 
projects which he called an attempt to convert ecology into 
business

the soviets have confirmed they sent fighter jets 
last month to the radical north african arab state of libya but 
insist the planes do not have the range to threaten libyas 
neighbors or israel 
britain today rejected the soviet explanation as frivolous but 
said the dispute will not spoil the the visit of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov in london 
with gorbachev first told a news conference he did not know about 
the sale later however gerasimov went on television to confirm 
elements of the report while seeking to minimize its significance 
gerasimov insisted during interviews thursday on channel 4 news 
and bbctv that the number of jets sent was around half a 
dozen not 12 to 15 as reported by us administration officials 
us defense department sources have said the aircraft are su24 
fencers which can fly an 800mile radius without refueling enough 
to reach egypt and possibly israel they say soviet transports 
carried the dismantled jets to libya in crates 
washington reports of the warplanes sale were headlined in 
britain dimming the glow emanating from gorbachevs talks with 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
the prime ministers spokesman said mrs thatcher asked 
gorbachev for an explanation and got none 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe also raised the issue with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze when shevardnadze 
brought up british arms sales to saudi arabia howe replied that 
britain was concerned because libya is a terrorist state the 
british spokesman reported 
gerasimov did not specify the type of aircraft sold in his tv 
interviews he said the planes were supplied to libya under a 1986 
deal an old contract and that not more than six were sold 
this is not a longrange bomber gerasimov said this is a 
bomber that you can use for closer activities its operational 
range is 300 miles 
its a frontline bomber its for defense only you cannot 
really use it for offensive purposes 
the interviewer noted that the planes could reach israel if 
refueled in the air to which gerasimov replied theoretically 
maybe but libya has no refueling capacity at all 
he said on bbctv that the warplanes were delivered in march and 
suggested they would not be operational for some time because they 
were delivered in crates you must put them together it takes 
time and knowhow to do it 
foreign minister william waldegrave was critical of the soviet 
explanation 
its a rather odd style for a major arms deal to say that the 
planes do not really work and will stay in their boxes he said 
in a radio interview why sell them in that case 
waldegrave said gerasimovs argument that the planes were 
defensive was slightly frivolous he also rejected comparisons 
to the british arms sale to saudi arabia 
if you want to say the saudi regime in its behavior 
internationally is comparable to the libyan regime in its behavior 
internationally i think he is pulling our leg a little 
waldegrave said 
but waldegrave said the deal wont sour the talks in the 
sense that the whole of this relationship we now have with the 
soviet union is one where we can build trust 
gerasimov told the news conference he suspected the report was 
leaked just to ruin the atmosphere of the gorbachevthatcher 
summit

early in the forbidden city the late 
playwright bill gunn draws a realistic picture of a troubled black 
family in 1936 philadelphia but the play runs into trouble as he 
turns from realism to the bizarre 
the acting in the play which opened thursday at the 
offbroadway public theaters luesther hall is exemplary joseph 
papp directed and loren sherman created an elaborate solid 
twostory interior possibly too upscale for 1936 
gloria foster plays the most fully drawn character molly 
hoffenburg shes a rather elegant matron who dusts her carefully 
displayed figurines dresses tastefully and is generous with food 
to men put out of work by the depression 
shes disappointed with her 16yearold son who wets the bed 
and is considered a learning problem at school and she gets 
hysterical when he mentions his older brother who died young in 
the south after no doctor would see him 
eventually molly is revealed to have dreamed of becoming a 
movie star and to have wanted her father to kill a white man for 
her because she cant realize her dream with those feelings 
unfaded she finally lets herself be picked up by a rich white man 
hoping hell take her to expensive places he takes her to a cheap 
hotel 
frankie r faison plays her adoring husband even after he finds 
out about her assignation he sympathizes with her shame he runs a 
garage and also works another job to provide for his family 
everything he dreamed of he says he has 
the son nick seems almost retarded but can recite poetry and 
has won a prize for creative writing his dead brother appears to 
him from time to time played by dimitri corbin 
instead of this being chilling its puzzling is he meant as a 
figment of nicks imagination or a supernatural being 
nick provokes the violent end of the play by saying his brother 
enters his body and tells him to kill a white person and put the 
blood in his mothers brandy as reparation for her loss the plays 
tone turns decidely odd 
the farther the playwright travels from reality the less his 
writing can handle it and the less the audience understands either 
the story or the intended message

taiwan and china have signed an agreement 
that will allow taiwanese athletes to compete in mainland china for 
the first time in four decades officials said today 
the announcement came one day after taiwan agreed to send an 
official delegation to china for the first time the 12member 
taiwanese government delegation led by finance minister shirley 
kuo will attend the annual meeting of the asian development bank 
in beijing next month 
the decisions were regarded as steps in a nationalist inititive 
to counter communist chinas efforts to isolate taiwan 
internationally 
the agreement for the athletes visit was signed thursday in 
hong kong after two months of negotiations chang fenghsu 
chairman of the taiwan olympic committee told a news conference 
officials said the agreement would permit taiwan to send a team 
to the asian junior gymnastics championship which begins in 
beijing on april 21 
taiwan also plans to compete in next years asian games in 
beijing and 10 other international sports competitions in china 
later this year officials said 
ho zhenliang deputy chairman of chinas olympic committee 
signed the agreement for china 
chang said the chinese also withdrew an earlier demand for 
chinese teams to compete in sports meets in taiwan 
they understood that it would take some time before we could 
agree to their visits here chang said 
in beijing the chinese olympic committee vice president he 
zhenliang said this is a major development in the sports 
exchanges between the two sides of the taiwan straits it will give 
a great impetus to the promotion of brotherhood and mutual 
understanding 
the decision to send the government delegation did not signal a 
change in government policies toward china said foreign ministry 
spokesman chen yuchu he said taiwan would continue to oppose 
official contacts with the rival communists who won a civil war in 
1949 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan claim they are the sole 
legitimate government of all china 
chang chungtung history professor at the national taiwan 
university described the governments decision as a major 
breakthrough and said it was probably intended to pressure the 
chinese communists to accept de facto nationalist rule over this 
island 
in 1987 the nationalists adopted a more flexible policy on 
private contacts with the chinese communists but the government 
continues to refuse to deal directly with the beijing government 
the new policy has led to an exchange of visits trade and 
cultural ties between taiwanese and chinese

lawmakers from missouri and kansas proposed 
legislation today to tighten regulation of interstate shipments of 
hazardous materials including radioactive wastes 
citizens have a right to expect that hazardous materials will 
be transported through their state as safely as possible said 
sen john danforth rmo one of the measures sponsors 
in remarks prepared for delivery when the legislation is 
introduced today in the senate danforth said it was partly 
prompted by concerns over the shipment of spent nuclear fuel by 
railroad through the midwest from the damaged three mile island 
nuclear plant in pennsylvania to a federal laboratory in idaho 
also sponsoring the measure were sens christopher bond rmo 
and nancy kassebaum rkan 
bond said the bill would plug dangerous loopholes in current 
regulations 
the legislation would require 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rail shipments of highlevel radioactive materials to move only 
by dedicated trains which means their sole purpose is to carry 
the nuclear materials currently shippers can transport such 
materials on mixed trains carrying other freight the tmi 
materials are moved by singlepurpose trains but that is not 
required by law 
we cannot take the risk of mixing hazardous materials such as 
the three mile island wastes with cars full of everything from 
grain to dangerous chemicals bond said 
the transportation department to establish standards to guide 
shippers in selecting routes for transporting highlevel 
radioactive wastes or spent nuclear fuel danforth said decisions 
on modes and routes for nuclear shipments now are made at the whim 
of the shipper who often is more concerned about costcutting than 
safety 
the nuclear regulatory commission to certify the safety of all 
shipping packages for transporting nuclear materials currently the 
energy department approves the containers used for its shipments 
such as the tmi materials while the nrc standards apply to other 
packages 
trucking companies carrying hazardous materials to obtain a 
permit from the transportation department the permit requirement 
would apply to motor carriers carrying radioactive materials some 
explosives and those materials extremely toxic by inhalation 
the legislation also would prohibit a motor carrier from 
carrying hazardous materials if dot auditors gave it a 
unsatisfactory rating for having too many safety violations 
the ratings are assigned now under the agencys safety auditing 
system and danforth said about 1110 hazardous materials carriers 
have unsatisfactory safety ratings 
all hazardous materials warning labels and placards to remain 
on shipping packages or vehicles until the materials have been 
removed the provision is to prevent accidents such as one that 
killed six kansas city firefighters last year at a construction 
site 
there was no warning placard on a trailer containing tons of 
blasting agent and it exploded after catching on fire firefighters 
have said they were unaware of the hazardous materials 
the bill also calls for the government to provide for 20 
transportation department inspectors for shipments of radioactive 
materials and require that all highlevel radioactive shipments be 
inspected at their starting point

railroad gates driving his semitrailer into the path of a commuter 
train and causing a collision that injured at least 68 people said 
will county sheriff john johnsen in lemont ill 
an amtrak passenger train that derailed near the virginianorth 
carolina border injured 28 people 
and in princeton ind liquid nitrogen and herbicides that 
spilled from storage containers prompted the evacuation of children 
from two nearby schools one injury was reported 
states attorney edward burmila said a decision would be made

illinois accident 
the gate was down and red warning signals were flashing when the 
collision occurred thursday johnsen said 
most of the injuries appeared to be minor officials said the 
rushhour commuter train carrying 98 people had picked up 
passengers in joliet and lockport and was en route to chicago 
it was a miracle no one was killed johnsen said 
the engineer james mullin saw the truck going around the 
crossing and knew it would be impossible to avoid impact and 
immediately slammed on the brakes said chris knapton a spokesman 
for the commuter rail line in chicago 
the engineer wheeled around opened the door plunged into the 
walkway and held on for dear life if he had not done that he 
would be dead knapton said

the likelihood of alimony being awarded 
divorced or separated women is twice as high if they are aged 40 or 
over than it is if they are under 30 a new census bureau study 
shows 
the study also showed that alimony was twice as likely for white 
women than for blacks 
and college graduates are significantly more likely to win 
alimony than women who failed to finish high school said the study 
released thursday 
they know how to use the system its as simple as that 
said census statistician mary henson of the higher alimony rates 
for white and more educated women 
according to the study alimony was awarded to 158 percent of 
white women whose marriages had broken up compared to only 80 
percent of blacks the alimony rate for hispanic women who can be 
of any race was 110 percent 
the report child support and alimony 1985 also repeated 
figures detailed by the census bureau last august showing a 
significant decline in child support payments received by women 
between 1983 and 1985 
the new version adds details on alimony and property settlements 
when couples are divorced or separated 
in addition to alimony white women were more likely than blacks 
to receive property settlements and the share receiving a cash 
settlement was higher for collegeeducated women 
as to the greater likelihood of women over age 40 receiving 
alimony ms henson commented that court awards were more common in 
past years while more younger women either receive voluntary 
payments from former spouses or do not seek support payments 
studies have shown that alimony awards were more common prior to 
the mid1970s than they have been since then 
the new analysis showed a drop in average alimony payments from 
4293 in 1983 to 3733 in 1985 that paralleled the decline 
reported last august in child support payments which fell from 
2528 in 1983 to 2215 in 1985 
in addition to the racial and ethnic differences found in the 
1985 alimony payments the study found the highest rate amomng 
women with four years of college or more 177 percent receiving 
alimony 
next were high school graduates at 153 percent nearly the same 
as the 152 percent for women who had attended but not finished 
college only 118 percent of women who failed to complete high 
school had been awarded alimony 
by age 185 percent of divorced or separated women aged 40 and 
over had been awarded alimony payments compared to 109 percent in 
the 30to39 age group and only 77 percent aged 18 to 29 
the overall alimony rate was 171 percent for divorced women 
138 percent for remarried women whose previous marriage had ended 
in divorce and 100 percent for women who were separated 
the report noted that 207 percent of women who had not been 
employed for five years before their separation were awarded 
alimony while the rate fell to 118 percent for women who held 
fulltime jobs when their marriage ended 
property settlements were much more common than alimony awards 
the study found 
for example 742 percent of women had won a settlement 
involving the house car or other property and 216 percent 
received a cash settlement 
racially 752 percent of white women and 660 percent among 
blacks had settlemets involving goods such as real estate 
furniture or cars hispanic women led in this category however at 
761 percent 
turning to cash settlements white women had a 221 percent 
rate compared to 190 percent among hispanics and 146 percent for 
black women 
rates of noncash settlements were very close among age groups 
748 percent for those 30 to 39 740 percent over age 40 and 734 
percent under age 30 the cash settlement rates were 247 percent 
for the youngest group 232 percent between 30 and 39 and 204 
percent over age 40 
by education the noncash settlement rate was highest for women 
with the least schooling those who had not finished high school 
won a noncash property settlement in 761 percent of separations 
but they were least likely to get cash 186 percent 
for high school graduates 747 percent received noncash 
settments and 208 percent got money 
the noncash rate was 739 percent for women who had attended 
college while 221 percent of them obtained cash of women with 
degrees 704 percent got a noncash settlement and 274 prcent got 
cash

a dutch traveler with aids will remain in 
jail despite a recommendation by regional federal immigration 
officials that he be allowed to attend an aids conference in san 
francisco 
hans paul verhoef wont be released until the recommendation is 
certified by immigration officials in washington said tom 
schiltgen district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service 
verhoef was taken into custody sunday at the minneapolisst 
paul international airport by customs officials who discovered the 
aids drug azt in his baggage and then questioned him about the 
disease verhoef an aids prevention worker told authorities he 
had aids and was en route to the conference 
schiltgen said thursday a decision on certifying the waiver 
would be made prior to a hearing scheduled for today ins spokesman 
greg leo in washington confirmed that the recommendation had been 
received and would be reviewed 
the ins has established that mr verhoef is an excludable as a 
person who is afflicted with a dangerous communicable disease 
schiltgen said 
schiltgen said earlier that to grant a waiver the ins must 
verify that verhoefs disease does not pose a health threat and 
that the us government would not incur expenses for verhoefs 
care 
verhoef 31 said in an interview from prison that he still 
hopes to attend the final days of the national lesbian and gay 
health conference in san francisco which ends sunday 
but he said his detention may have had some positive benefits 
this morning a woman said to me that i did more things for the 
cause being here than being in san francisco verhoef said and 
i think thats true because the us government is forced to 
revise their policy on having people with aids in the country or 
not 
jonathan burris verhoefs minneapolis attorney said the case 
will set a national precedent relative to whether or not people 
with aids will be admitted into the country freely and in what 
fashion 
verhoefs incarceration touched off a wave of criticism of 
immigration policies and protests in the twin cities san francisco 
and elsewhere 
san francisco mayor art agnos declared thursday hans verhoef

independence us and soviet obeserves were expected to attend the 
meeting 
anton lubowski one of swapos few white members told a new 
conference that the head of the un operation in namibia 
finlands martti ahtisaari should be replaced immediately 
they un officials are coming with exactly the same 
arguments as south africa that the guerrillas must be disarmed 
lubowski said what kind of objectivity is that 
it is clear they are working with the south africans and are 
in the south africans pocket said lubowski a windhoek attorney 
lubowski belongs to swapos legal political wing and is a member 
of the organizations secretariat its administrative arm swapos 
top leaders and the outlawed guerrilla operation are based abroad 
at least 259 swapo guerrillas and 25 security force members have 
been killed since gun battles broke out saturday when a ceasefire 
was supposed to have taken effect police officials said they said 
78 security force members and an undetermined number of swapo 
fighters have been injured 
south african col japie dreyer briefing journalists at a 
military base in the northern town of oshakati said four south 
african impala jet fighters were called into action thursday for 
the first time this week the jets fired on swapo positions 
killing 17 people he said dreyer said the guerrillas lacked radio 
equipment and there was little chance they could be instructed to 
retreat or surrender as south africa has demanded 
south africa claims swapo has sent more than 1500 guerrillas 
into northern namibia in violation of an accord requiring the 
insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles away in angola 
swapo leaders contend the guerrillas have been in namibia for 
some time and have no intention of leaving for angola 
however angolas president jose eduardo dos santos whose 
country has hosted the guerrillas for 23 years criticized swapo 
leaders for the incursion into namibia 
i regret the swapo leadership was not able to exercise total 
control over its guerrillas at the critical moment of the start of 
un resolution 435 by stopping anyone crossing the 
angolannamibian frontier dos santos said thursday in luanda 
some un and other officials have suggested swapo field 
commanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested 
to namibia as of april 1 and set up bases several captured 
guerrillas say they returned to namibia in search of un personnel 
and didnt expect to fight with security forces 
members of the six frontline states a southern africa regional 
bloc have offered to send troops to reinforce the un forces the 
angolan state news agency angop reported today there was no word 
from the united nations 
south africa which has ruled namibia for 74 years has 
threatened to suspend the un independence plan for that country 
if the crisis is not resolved but south africas foreign minister 
pik botha said thursday that south africa remained committed to 
the plan 
he said south africa was receiving an unprecedented degree of 
international support and was likely to benefit by being spared 
further economic sanctions swapos international image had been 
weakened he said 
the south african council of churches led by prominent 
antiapartheid clergymen said thursday that the carnage of the 
last few days could have been prevented if the united nations had 
denied south africas request to let its forces leave their bases 
to combat the guerrillas the church council said the credibility 
of the un peacekeeping force was now in doubt 
cedric thornberry secondincommand of the un contingent 
said the united nations hoped to have its first infantry battalions 
in the northern battle areas by early next week on wednesday the 
united nations accepted a us offer to airlift a battalion of 
about 850 finnish soldiers to namibia 
the united nations has authorized 4650 troops for the namibia 
operation but only 921 have arrived the only forces in the north 
are 300 logistical personnel

planes landing at the lebanon regional 
airport are using the federal aviation administrations new class 
of microwave landing systems the first of 250 to be installed by 
the faa around the country 
its much simpler it doesnt take as much space on the 
ground and we hope its going to be even more accurate than the 
old instrumentlanding system harold buker the state 
aeronautics director said thursday after the faa inaugurated the 
microwave landing system 
i foresee greater reliability for airport oprerations and an 
increase in safety said marcel theberge manager of the 
cityowned airport 
the faa has received congressional approval to install 250 
microwave landing systems throughout the country in the next 10 
years the lebanon airport was first partly because of the hilly 
terrain and because landing patterns are limited buker said 
with the old system we can fly only one line directly into 
the field buker said this will let us fly in from different 
directions in addition to spreading out flight patterns which 
will ease noise problems the system promises to reduce radio 
interference problems that hamper growth in the old 
instrumentlanding systems and to increase airport landing 
capacity 
while the lebanon installation was the first by the faa the 
system has been in use at a handful of private airports around the 
country 
authorities expect it will be a least a decade before airplanes 
routinely operate with the new type of radio beacon which uses 
microwaves or precise guiding onto runways in bad weather 
the major airlines have not endorsed the system but have agreed 
to a cooperative study with the faa airline officials say it will 
cost more than 250000 on each airplane they equip to use it 
the program has been welcomed by smaller commuter airlines 
which typically serve airports like lebanon where service can be 
impeded by short runways bad weather and hilly terrain lebanon is 
about 60 miles north of concord near the vermont border 
theberge said the older instrumentlanding systems take up four 
buildings and quite a bit of land while the new system needs 
two buildings at the airport 
lebanon regional airport is a commuter airport that until 
precision airlines temporarily halted service had about 16 flights 
a day to boston new york hartford conn albany ny and other 
regional airports currently business express is the sole airline 
using the field

an elderly man who mistakenly 
believed hed been forgotten on fathers day and shot six 
relatives killing two of them now lives in an adult care home 
with no restrictions on his movements 
melville henwood 81 killed his daughter and soninlaw 
elizabeth and john flory and wounded his wife and three of his 
grandchildren on june 8 1986 he apparently didnt realize 
fathers day was a week away 
henwood was found innocent by reason of insanity in the 
shootings on oct 26 1987 and placed in a psychiatric hospital 
however he went free in february after administrators at a 
second hospital to which he had been transferred allowed him to 
sign a voluntary commitment order ending what had been stringent 
court control of his case the administrators said they concluded 
that he was well enough to handle a lessrestrictive setting 
its one of those things that went wrong hes as free as you 
are we dont have any control over him said dr lynn blunt 
clinical director of the michigan center for forensic psychiatry in 
ypsilanti 
henwood shot his relatives after they had gathered for sunday 
dinner in the florys home where his ailing wife edna was 
living in a tape recording made the night before the shootings 
henwood complained about being lonely and forgotten on fathers day 
mrs henwood was critically wounded but recovered as did his 
grandchildren michael flory then 9 christine flory then 12 and 
gayle scott then 15 two other grandchildren christopher scott 
and audra scott werent at home the scotts are mrs florys 
children by a previous marriage 
the children still live in the house where their parents were 
shot christopher scott said none of them would discuss their 
grandfathers release 
eaton county prosecutor g michael hocking started asking 
questions when a sheriffs deputy gave a ride home to an old man he 
met march 24 in an eaton rapids market the man introduced himself 
as mel henwood 
its kind of scary its especially scary when you think that 
fathers day is getting closer hocking said 
under michigan law people who sign voluntary commitment papers 
void their courtordered treatment thats what henwood did blunt 
said adding we were very surprised when they allowed him to 
sign the voluntary order 
however tom deloach a spokesman for the state department of 
mental health said ypsilanti regional psychiatric hospital 
staffers determined that henwood was ready to go into a community 
program hes still getting outpatient mental health care deloach 
said 
given the verdict henwoods mental health treatment must be 
viewed as entirely separate from his criminal trial deloach said 
an employee at the facility where henwood is staying refused to 
let him be interviewed saying it would upset him 
hocking cant prosecute henwood on the same 12 felony charges 
that stemmed from the shootings but is looking into his release if 
theres no legal recourse he said he wants the law changed

parliament today lifted the sevenyear ban 
on the solidarity trade movement and enacted constitutional changes 
to give poland the first freely elected legislative body in the 
east bloc 
the sejm or parliament passed a package of six bills that 
enact into law a historic agreement on political economic and 
trade union reforms reached wednesday between the solidarityled 
opposition and communist authorities 
polish leader wojciech jaruzelski who suppressed the soviet 
blocs only independent labor movement when he imposed martial law 
in december 1981 looked on as the votes were taken 
in a surprise move independent deputy ryszard bender proposed 
that the sejm restore the states official name to the republic 
of poland instead of the polish peoples republic adopted 
when communists took over after world war ii if we dont pass 
this change today the next sejm will said bender saying 
the present name had been imposed during the stalinist era 
after a recess in which he consulted with parliament leaders 
bender agreed to withdraw his motion and let it be referred to a 
special commission to consider further changes in the constitution 
then the sejm passed the constitutional changes 384 to 4 with 
17 abstentions and the new law on trade unions 339 to 4 with 43 
abstentions 
also passed in short order was the new law on elections to the 
sejm by 3713 with 15 absentions elections to a new senate by 
3587 with 25 abstentions on the right to form associations 
30414 with 71 abstentions and on legalizing farmers unions 
enabling the existence of rural solidarity 3268 with 53 
abstentions 
the accord signed by the solidarityled opposition and the 
government resulted from two months of intense talks 
solidarity leader lech walesa on thursday called the agreement a 
political victory but warned it could be disastrous if poles do 
not quickly use it to improve the economy and elect effective 
representatives 
the approval came with the blessing of gen jaruzelski who 
threatened to resign as party leader in january if the party did 
not restore the union 
the general argued that legalization will culminate his policy 
of national reconciliation and open the way to a united effort to 
combat polands pressing economic and social problems 
the new laws also provide for elections in june that will be the 
freest ever held in the communist country 
the 460 sejm seats will be divided into two groups with the 
communist party and its allies guaranteed 65 percent the remainder 
go to independent candidates 
also a democratically elected senate with 100 members will be 
created for the first time communist candidates will face direct 
electoral competition from anticommunists 
anyone who collects 3000 signatures can run for one of two 
seats from each of the 49 provinces with one extra seat apiece for 
warsaw and katowice cities 
the senate will be able to veto legislation of the sejm and the 
sejm must muster a twothird majority to override the veto 
senate and sejm together will form a national assembly that will 
select a president with executive and veto powers who can dissolve 
parliament during a constitutional crisis the new post seems to 
have been designed for jaruzelski as a guarantee that poland will 
stay in the communist bloc 
walesa said he expected solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 
million members but would like at least three competing unions 
authorities proposed talks with the opposition in august during 
the years second nationwide wave of strikes 
both sides hope the agreement will help repair an economy 
debilitated by a 39 billion foreign debt and revive the dispirited 
population

the takeovers are being supervised by the federal deposit 
insurance corp which regulates commercial banks the agency began 
the takeover program on feb 7 with the aim of quickly taking 
control of the sickest sampls in order to minimize losses until 
congress appropriates the money to shut them down or sell them to 
new owners 
members of the house banking committee began writing their

revelations about president bushs role in 
covert support for the nicaraguan contras should not be allowed to 
damage evolving bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy between 
congress and the white house house speaker jim wright said today 
were not going to permit anything that happened in the past 
to interfere with what happens in the future wright dtexas 
told reporters following a speech in which he extolled 
bipartisanship in us policy toward central america 
that does not imply approval or sanction of bushs role as 
a gobetween in supplying the nicaraguan rebels disclosed in a 
document released thursday at oliver norths irancontra trial 
wright said 
but he added i dont think its productive to allow 
anything to prevent our going forward and building a basis for a 
truly bipartisan approach in the future 
i am determined that im going to proceed on the basis of 
trust in what president bush and secretary of state james baker 
say to me its a new day and weve turned a new leaf written a 
new chapter we mustnt allow it to be poisoned by what we read in 
the last chapter 
in his speech to a democratic policy group the center for 
national policy wright described the bipartisan accord on policy 
toward nicaragua announced at the white house two weeks ago and 
said legislation extending humanitarian aid to the rebels would 
be passed by the house before the end of the month 
the new aid package totaling 58 million includes 49 million 
to maintain the current flow of food medicine and clothing to the 
rebels through february 1990 when national elections are scheduled 
in nicaragua details of the measure were still being worked out 
but it was scheduled to be introduced next week 
some snags remained to be worked out as well in the language 
of a proposed letter from baker to congressional leaders giving 
four key committees on capitol hill the right to shut off the aid 
after november if it is not being administered according to what 
wright called a gentlemens agreement between baker and 
congress 
in his speech describing the aid package wright emphasized that 
some of the money can be used to repatriate or relocate the roughly 
11000 rebels from their honduran jungle camps along the nicaraguan 
border and that no money would flow to any group which undertakes 
offensive military action or human rights violations 
and the speaker hailed the bush administrations efforts to 
develop mutual understanding and mutual trust contrasting it 
with president reagans tenure 
we have confidence that in the bush administration there will 
be no covert mining of harbors no publishing of assassination 
manuals and no lying to congress wright said 
reagans approach o nicaragua including covert aid to the 
rebels so poisoned the well of public discourse that it made an 
enormous emotional impact both at home and throughout the world

raisa gorbachev argued with sothebys chairman 
today about who really painted a portrait of the russian czar peter 
iii which was presented it to her as a gift to the soviet union 
but it was a friendly disagreement between the wife of the 
visiting soviet president and lord gowrie chairman of the fine art 
auction house over whether the longmissing 18th century painting 
was by the court artist alexander rokotov it really doesnt 
belong to rokotov himself its from the school of him mrs 
gorbachev said during the presentation at the soviet embassy 
gowrie said sothebys had been assured by a soviet museum the 
painting was by rokotov mrs gorbachev replied sometimes its 
difficult for experts to establish firmly 
but she said she was delighted anyway at receiving the picture 
the only painting of the czar that the russians do not have 
thank you lord gowrie for the presentation that is from the 
bottom of our hearts we take it as a sign of respect for our 
country our nation and our national culture said mrs gorbachev 
the czar born in 1728 was the father of catherine the great 
he was assassinated in 1762 by two of his imperial officers 
the portrait which sothebys experts said showed the czar at 
the age of 19 was missing for nearly 50 years it surfaced in 
london and sothebys bought the picture for 7000 pounds 12000 
in april 
the original 1861 manuscript of the novel fathers and sons 
by ivan turgenev also was handed over to the soviets today 
sothebys said 
the soviets bought it for roughly 500000 pounds 850000 
through a private sale arranged by the auction house the 
unidentified british sellers wish had been that the manuscript 
should return to its own country

i know that it is a great honor in great britain for a foreign 
official to speak from the rostrum of londons guildhall i 
appreciate the responsibility that i assume addressing the entire 
british people 
speaking from this historic place with ageold traditions i want 
first of all to greet the people of britain and on behalf of my 
people to express respect for the nation that has given the world 
great authors scientists artists historians and philosophers 
without whom european culture would be inconceivable the nation of 
famous seafarers inventors workers and engineers without whom 
modern civilization would be inconceivable the nation whose 
political experience has enriched the history of the world 
speaking from this rostrum i state with satisfaction that 
important positive changes are taking place in relations between 
our two countries our relations are gaining in trust i believe 
that their prospects are good 
this building itself which is reminiscent of so many events 
evokes the thought of history the 20th century is drawing to a 
close it has been rich in tumultuous events and has truly marked a 
turning point in the history of the entire human civilization 
it must be a rare person who is not wondering today where do we 
go from here what lies beyond that watershed 
in recent years the awareness of the crucial nature of our time 
has become universal it is associated with hope but is also ridden 
with alarm 
the world community stands at the crossroads of two policies 
one speaking generally is a policy of force it is rooted in the 
past 
the other policy is only now being shaped it is sustained by 
the rapid process of the crystallization of the worlds integrity 
and interdependence the priority of universal human interests and 
values is its imperative 
only very recently soviet people have seen its highest 
expression in the solidarity shown by the world in response to the 
earthquake in armenia 
we sincerely thank the government and people of great britain 
all its citizens who took our misfortune to heart expressed 
sympathy and gave us support 
the present generation of political leaders are shouldering the 
burden of crucial choices the burden of making momentous 
decisions none of them has the moral right to shirk that 
responsibility 
we in the soviet union began by looking at ourselves four years 
ago in april 1985 we made a choice asking ourselves the most 
difficult questions we have tried to answer them honestly and 
straightforwardly we have set out to reappraise our experience 
our history the world around us and our own position in it 
we have firmly opted for overcoming ossified dogmas and stale 
patterns of thinking and stereotypes this has produced perestroika 
and the new thinking and the domestic and foreign policies based on 
them 
happening in a country like the ussr this has evoked 
extraordinary interest everywhere and has had an impact on the 
international atmosphere and the realities of the political 
situation in the world 
our perestroika is the subject of hundreds of books thousands 
of articles official reports and academic studies of debates at 
seminars and conferences and of radio and television broadcasts 
today the interest in our perestroika is not diminishing and 
as i understand you want to hear from me what is the situation 
now how will perestroika develop further and what are its chances 
of success 
well our perestroika is in earnest and for the long term there 
is no turning back for anyone the people have firmly linked their 
destiny with perestroika 
the election of peoples deputies of the ussr which was 
held in a democratic atmosphere unprecedented in our entire 
history has demonstrated that soviet people are not going to turn 
off the path chosen four years ago 
the battle of feelings and views the upsurge of interest in 
public and government affairs the desire to make the most of 
glasnost and to protect it the variety of conflicting opinions and 
proposals and the concern that words should not again be at 
variance with deeds all this reflects both the fundamental gains 
of our perestroika and the massive support that it enjoys 
the communist party of the soviet union received in this 
election powerful support of the people 
we launched perestroika with our eyes open we foresaw the 
complexity and the special nature of the process realizing that it 
would shake up thoroughly our entire society 
we were not wrong about what counts most it is also true 
however that the magnitude of many domestic problems political 
economic social and moral was not evident at once but revealed 
itself as the process moved on that calls for fresh approaches and 
solutions and most intense intellectual and practical work 
as for the difficulties and they do exist we accept them as 
a natural expression of contradictions inherent in a transition 
period 
none of these difficulties indicate that the concept itself of 
perestroika is wrong they only accentuate the watershed character 
of the period we are going through when the old ways are still 
alive and cannot be done away with overnight while new approaches 
are as yet unable to pick up full speed 
in this situation problems and difficulties are unavoidable for 
it involves farreaching changes in everything in the way of life 
and in the attitude toward work and civic duty 
we have chosen definitively and irrevocably the route leading 
to new forms of life democratizing our society in all spheres 
we are convinced that it will create and is already creating 
conditions for full selfexpression of the individual and freedom 
of thought and that it alone will make it possible to develop the 
values inherent in socialism such as social protection justice and 
humanism in production and human relations

<TEXT>
in so doing we set our sights on the highest standards of 
glasnost and keeping people informed both those that are accepted 
internationally and those that stem from our own ideals and 
cultural and historical traditions 
we are convinced that only through democratization is it 
possible to build a wellfunctioning healthy and dynamic economy 
radical economic reform which blends together planned regulation 
and the market will help us devise a new economic mechanism 
harmonize the numerous forms of socialist ownership and economic 
activities and give ample room to producers initiative and 
enterprise 
we have formulated a new agrarian policy seeking to tear down 
the administrativecommand system in agriculture various forms of 
leasing help to restore the status of farmerpeasant his right to 
be in control of land machinery and the product of his work 
the decisions adopted are of fundamental importance not only for 
agriculture but also for the social and economic development of 
our country as a whole and even for the concept of our societys 
development 
despite the exceptional changes that our society has undergone 
in the last four years despite the obvious fact that we are 
already living in a different intellectual and political climate 
moving at a different historical pace we still believe that this 
is only the beginning of the road for us perestroika takes time 
patience perseverance and consistent pursuit 
we are aware that tests and trials are still ahead for us we 
are faced with problems resulting from a lack of political culture 
and the imperfection of mechanisms that safeguard democracy and 
protect it against destructive antisocial actions 
and weakness is impermissible here also because it can slow down 
the process of democratization itself 
we have a great deal to do in the sphere of interethnic 
relations we shall do that while adjusting our federation to the 
processes that are under way in soviet society 
our fundamental principle of a strong center and strong 
republics reflects the will of all our peoples 
reforming our political system is a powerful tool for tackling 
all those problems and implementing all our initiatives 
we are building an open democratic and free society which has 
learned the lessons of its past a society based on law and 
responsibility a society that keeps its citizens well informed 
that rests on its citizens initiative and enterprise on soviet 
socialist patriotism and dedication to humane socialism aimed at 
elevating the human being 
perestroika in the soviet union is a farreaching and 
fundamental process that responds above all to the needs of our 
countrys internal evolution however it also mirrors changes 
typical of the modern world in general selfisolation is alien to 
the very nature of perestroika 
at the same time we note with satisfaction that it is making a 
positive impact on the international scene the democratization of 
soviet society proceeds together with the process of setting 
democratic standards of openness in international affairs 
the policy of building a state based on the rule of law in our 
country coincides with the trend toward enhancing the role of law 
in relations between states 
our economic reform presupposes the soviet unions closer 
integration into the world economy and may be conducive to building 
a truly global market and a new world economic order 
in recent years we have seen the emergence of real opportunities 
to close the last page of postwar history and enter into a new 
period of peace 
reliance on force is a dangerous approach which leads to an 
impasse the realities of today have laid bare the failure of the 
philosophy of confrontation 
the decades of the cold war have cost too dearly both to east 
and to west continuation of allout confrontation may spell 
catastrophe for all 
this is the objective logic of world politics at its present 
stage our new political thinking is governed by its laws 
its fundamentals and practical conclusions in summarized form 
were outlined at the un general assembly in new york 
let me just recall that it sets forth the fundamental longterm 
course of soviet foreign policy and a blueprint for specific 
measures for the transition to a period of peace 
we invite everyone to dialogue and interaction for the sake of 
survival and progress 
one can read in the newspapers every day about the various 
dangerous and pressing problems facing mankind i would only point 
out a simple fact which is sometimes overlooked all of them are 
interrelated 
it is impossible to cut this knot with a single stroke but it 
can be untied we cannot put off this common task 
we shall not be able to ensure genuine and substantial 
disarmament unless we make concurrent radical changes in the 
political climate on our planet 
we shall not be able to save the environment unless we embark on 
the path of disarmament and releasing resources to solve 
environmental problems 
we shall not be able to make the situation throughout the world 
healthier unless we change the nature of northsouth relations 
we shall not be able to eliminate famine in the world combat 
drugs aids and terrorism or put an end to gross violations of the 
rights of individuals and entire nations until we recognize that 
all that is our common concern until we rise above the narrow 
egoistical understanding of our interests and draw up guidelines 
for international interaction in keeping with the needs of today 
recent experience testifies to the possibility of a peaceful 
order based on the principles of freedom of choice and balance of 
interests in the context of reducing weapons arsenals and lowering 
the level of military confrontation we will continue to prove this 
with our deeds

a judge today sentenced mob boss nicodemo 
little nicky scarfo and seven associates to life in prison 
instead of death for killing a fellow gangster 
judge eugene clarke took the sentencing decision away from the 
jury thursday after ruling that prosecutors failed to show there 
were enough aggravating circumstances for a death sentence 
the eight men all convicted wednesday in the july 1985 slaying 
of frank frankie flowers dalfonso were formally sentenced 
today with death ruled out by the thursday ruling the only choice 
available to the judge was to give the eight life in prison with no 
chance of parole 
friends and relatives of the eight broke out in applause as the 
judge announced his decision thursday 
scarfo 60 who is the head of organized crime in the 
philadelphia and southern new jersey area already is serving a 
14year sentence in a 1 million extortion case he also faces at 
least 40 more years for his conviction last november in a federal 
racketeering case 
while expressing relief that their clients were avoiding the 
death penalty defense lawyers said they would appeal the murder 
convictions clarke set a hearing on posttrial motions including 
requests for a new trial for july 26 
i just feel like ive been pulled out the grave said robert 
simone scarfos lawyer there is not doubt in my mind that this 
jury a runaway jury would have brought in the death penalty they 
were champing at the bit to put them in the electric chair 
but juror arthur trimble 60 said the jury totally supported 
clarkes sentencing decision 
we were so happy as a group that the judge took it out of 
our hands he said we were not after the death penalty 
during the sentencing phase of the trial thursday police 
firearms examiner john finor testified that bystanders were 
standing nearby when dalfonso was gunned down on a philadelphia 
street corner 
but clarke ruled the situation did not constitute an aggravating 
circumstance necessary for the death penalty under pennsylvania 
law he also decided not to allow prosecutors to bolster their case 
for the death penalty by telling the jury about the november 
racketeering convictions of scarfo and five codefendants 
the jurors took only three hours wednesday to convict scarfo and 
the others of firstdegree murder conspiracy and the possession of 
an instrument of crime 
government witnesses said dalfonso was murdered because he 
failed to show scarfo proper respect 
besides scarfo and nicholas nicky whip milano 27 the 
others convicted were joseph ligambi 48 and philip narducci 26 
identified as the shooters francis faffy iannarella 32 
accused of supplying the two murder guns salvatore chuckie 
merlino 47 and his brother lawrence yogi merlino 32 and 
frank narducci jr 31 philips brother

mikhail gorbachev today had lunch with 
queen elizabeth ii at windsor castle and invited her to visit the 
soviet union 
her office said the queen told gorbachev she would like to 
accept but her foreign travel is fixed years in advance 
she would be the first british sovereign to visit the soviet 
union since the russian royal family her cousins were murdered 
after the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
thanking mr gorbachev her majesty explained that the program 
for her visits were fixed a number of years in advance she hoped 
it would be possible to visit the soviet union in due course a 
buckingham palace statement said 
the announcement came as the soviet leader left windsor castle 
for londons heathrow airport to return home at the end of a 
40hour visit to britain 
earlier gorbachev and his wife raisa drove to the majestic 
castle on the thames river in drizzling rain 
maj nicholas parsons invited the kremlin leader in fluent 
russian to inspect a guard of honor of bearskincapped coldstream 
guards 
the queen in bright pink skirt and cape and her husband 
prince philip greeted her guests on the castle doorstep 
gorbachev was the first soviet leader since 1967 to meet the 
queen and by putting the royal seal on his 40hour visit to 
britain he clearly hoped to enhance the benign image he is trying 
to implant in western minds 
windsor castle the palace 20 miles west of london has been a 
royal residence for more than 800 years and the queen took the 
gorbachevs on a tour of some of its rooms and held a lunch in their 
honor 
the 34 guests including prime minister margaret thatcher and 
her husband denis ate smoked salmon cornets filled with crabmeat 
layers of fillet of beef duck puree and sliced artichoke all 
baked in pastry 
earlier today gorbachev delivered a major televised policy 
speech in the oakpaneled chandeliered splendor of guildhall for 
800 years the seat of london city government 
like many of britains archaic institutions the guildhalls 
power is more in its looks than in its powers like queen elizabeth 
ii the guildhall and its lord mayor are restricted largely to 
ceremonial duties 
the gorbachevs arrived at the guildhall in a 24car motorcade 
through the congested streets of the city londons financial 
district where the lord mayor alderman sir christopher collett 
waited resplendent in black goldbraided robes and threecorner 
hat 
gorbachev was escorted into the building in a procession led by 
the mayor the sergeant at arms and officials bearing a sword and a 
gold mace symbol of city authority 
a trumpet fanfare announced the gorbachevs entry into the hall 
and they stood beside mrs thatcher and her husband denis as the 
soviet and british anthems were played 
an array of dignitaries packed the hall ranging across the 
political spectrum from mrs thatcher through archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie to bruce kent chairman of the campaign 
for nuclear disarmament 
pikemen musketeers sheriffs and city elders in blue robes 
stood by to complete the pageant

as i have already announced our armed forces will be reduced by 
500000 men which is 12 percent of their total strength during 
19891990 the military budget will be cut by over 14 percent and 
the production of weapons by nearly 20 percent we have already 
actually started implementing this program 
i take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently 
decided to cease this year the production of enriched weaponsgrade 
uranium 
in addition to the industrial reactor for the production of 
weaponsgrade plutonium shut down in 1987 we plan to shut down two 
other such reactors this and next year without commissioning new 
units to replace them this is yet another major step towards the 
complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for use 
in weapons 
the elimination of chemical weapons is a most important problem 
in efforts to demilitarize international politics 
we appreciate the position of great britain which has eliminated 
its chemical weapons unilaterally and was the first to raise this 
issue at an international conference our bilateral cooperation has 
been quite good 
soviet experts have visited the british research center in 
portadown while british experts have visited our center we have 
completed the construction of a facility for the destruction of 
chemical weapons and intend to invite soon your representatives to 
visit it 
the soviet union will be vigorously working for an early 
conclusion of a global international convention on the complete 
prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons 
we have adopted several important decisions for the conversion 
of our military industries a considerable number of defense 
factories and design bureaus and their related research potential 
are becoming involved in manufacturing consumer goods machinery 
equipment and other facilities and products for agriculture and the 
light and food industries 
a substantial number of military transport aircraft will be used 
for carrying civilian cargoes 
the soviet union has made several major steps toward 
transparency of its military activities 
we have already stated that we are going soon to make public our 
defense budget data this will be done by the new supreme soviet of 
the ussr the difficulty here is that the nonconvertibility of 
the ruble hampers an objective comparison of our military 
expenditures with those of the west we are looking for the most 
appropriate way of presenting our data 
as for the numerical strength of the armed forces i can now say 
the following as of jan 1 this year they number 4258000 men 
including 1596000 in the ground forces and 437300 in the navy 
while missile forces air defense troops the air force and combat 
support and logistics forces account for the rest of that figure 
after the unilateral reduction of our armed forces their total 
strength by the end of 1990 will be approximately 3760000 
by way of comparison the total strength of the us armed 
forces including the national guard in our country similar 
components are integrated in the armed forces exceeds 3000000 
it should be noted that the strength of the us navy is more than 
double that of the soviet union 
we have published data on the military potentials of the warsaw 
treaty organization and nato in europe they show approximate 
parity 
the comparison between the armed forces of the warsaw treaty 
organization and nato as a whole including strategic nuclear 
forces gives the following figures for the warsaw treaty 
organization 53 million men 10500 aircraft 4200 combat 
helicopters 80000 tanks 160 large surface ships nato is 
superior to the warsaw treaty organization in all those components 
with the exception of tanks 
in short fears about the soviet military threat are 
groundless 
negotiations and a search for compromise between major countries 
involved in the protracted arms race would clear the way to a 
reduced level of military confrontation fewer weapons and a less 
onerous burden of military expenditures 
in this regard the vienna document and the start of the talks on 
reductions in the armed forces and armaments in europe and on 
confidencebuilding measures are an event without precedent in the 
nuclear age the soviet union is prepared to take very farreaching 
steps toward a demilitarization of europe and in the overall 
european process 
we are prepared to engage in a most constructive dialogue and 
cooperation with great britain concerning all matters relative to 
the concluding document of the vienna meeting 
it is well known that we are opposed to unjustified linkages in 
disarmament matters we do not make agreement on one issue 
contingent on a solution to another but this is rather a problem 
of how best to organize the negotiating process objectively 
speaking in our century everything is linked 
so of course there can be no doubt that if for instance nato 
goes ahead with its program of modernizing tactical nuclear 
weapons this is bound to affect the vienna talks 
confidencebuilding measures and the situation in europe in 
general this is bound to devalue much of what has been achieved 
under the inf treaty 
in this context it is appropriate for me to recall once again 
that britain contributed to creating conditions for making the 
treaty possible 
we strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear 
weapons we are not modernizing nor do we intend to modernize them 
unless we are made to i believe that common sense will prevail 
we are convinced that the time has come to start negotiations on 
reducing soviet and us naval forces and those of the warsaw 
treaty and the north atlantic alliance 
the question of 50 percent reductions in soviet and us 
strategic offensive arms continues to be on top of the agenda of 
our relations with the united states we are ready to resume 
negotiations at any time

as for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence i believe that it 
is high time that instead of speaking of how to deter others 
with nuclear weapons we spoke of how to deter to keep in check 
nuclear weapons themselves it means putting an end to the 
accumulation and upgrading of those weapons gradually but steadily 
destroying their stockpiles and ultimately their complete 
elimination and prohibition of their production 
we believe that it is really possible to build a safe and 
nuclearfree world undoubtedly the road to such a world lies not 
only through greater openness and reliable verification it also 
requires building confidence which depends on many aspects of 
todays international affairs 
sovietbritish relations can make a substantial contribution to 
these efforts they possess an extraordinary political and 
historical potential supplemented by a factor which is becoming 
increasingly important at present both countries are permanent 
members of the un security council if constructively pooled 
together our efforts do not merely add up but multiply as an 
international factor 
conferences on humanitarian questions and human rights could 
produce a major breakthrough toward new frontiers in the european 
process in a few weeks time the london information forum will 
launch this series and the 1991 moscow conference will conclude it 
we see areas of agreement in soviet and british approaches 
towards the settlement of regional conflicts here too some 
experience has been gained but what matters most is that the 
leaders of both countries are prepared to explore and propose in a 
calm and businesslike manner their ideas and good offices to the 
parties concerned 
we are in favor of using sovietbritish dialogue for 
internationalizing the economic problems of todays world a 
conclave of several personalities even influential ones will not 
suffice for that all have the right to be involved in matters 
which concern everyone 
only common efforts on the basis of equality would make it 
possible to avoid disastrous upheavals in the world economy and 
such upheavals may occur if we put off our search for radical and 
just solutions and rely on stopgap measures 
as regards environmental issues the soviet union will 
faithfully abide by existing agreements and cooperate in 
international programs and will soon adhere to those it is not yet 
party to 
i believe that in this area too many opportunities exist for 
enriching sovietbritish relations 
to conclude i must tell you that our relations are changing for 
the better 
both our governments have put in a lot of efforts to make this 
happen 
we duly appreciate the consistent efforts made by british prime 
minister mrs margaret thatcher 
certainly all is not so simple in politics substantial 
differences and disagreements still exist problems could also 
arise in implementing what was agreed upon yesterday at downing 
street 
however it is my impression that we have set the right 
guidelines horizons of trust have expanded we have seen even more 
clearly that we are able to act in the spirit of mutual 
understanding and in a productive manner in upholding our national 
interests within the framework of the universal values of modern 
civilization 
and the fact that we are different is an incentive for 
exchanges cooperation and dialogue between our two states and 
peoples 
it is with these feelings that we are going back to moscow full 
of impressions of your city and of the people whom we have had a 
chance to meet during the brief time here 
at the conclusion of our stay in your country we shall visit her 
majesty the queen 
i would like to wish all those present in this hall all who are 
listening to me and all british families happiness wellbeing and 
peace 
all the best to you thank you

president bush today deflected complaints by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that the us review of arms 
control and foreign policy was delaying negotiations to slow the 
nuclear arms race 
we are making a prudent review bush said mr 
gorbachev knows there is no footdragging going on and im not 
concerned in the least 
gorbachev on a visit to britain said through a spokesman on 
thursday that continuity is the name of the game we are a little 
bit apprehensive we could be losing it 
bush with a flash of irritation in a session in the white house 
press room said he would be ready to discuss the arms situation 
with the soviets when the review is completed that is expected at 
the end of the month or at the latest in early may 
secretary of state james a baker iii will go to moscow next 
month to discuss the suspended negotiations with the soviets and 
also prospects for a first summit meeting between bush and 
gorbachev 
the negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear weapons went into 
recess in december and were tentatively set to resume in 
midfebruary but the bush administration postponed the resumption 
for the review which includes an analysis of us nuclear forces 
on a related subject gorbachev promised today to make deep cuts 
in the soviet military and announced he would close two more 
nuclear reactors that produce weaponsgrade plutonium 
asked for his appraisal bush again deflected the question we 
will react when we are ready to react he said 
meanwhile bush called developments in poland mindboggling 
because of the pace of reform i think it is a sign of the change 
of democratization this is all very encouraging 
he said he had not decided whether he should consider a visit to 
the east european country

riots broke out in the hometown of irans 
ayatollah hussein ali montazeri after his dismissal as designated 
successor to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the main iranian 
opposition group said today 
the baghdadbased mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors 
said a number of people died in the clashes between civilians and 
soldiers in najafabad in central isfahan province 
in a statement sent to the associated press office in nicosia 
the group said residents chanting down with khomeini had 
taken arms from the soldiers and returned their fire the group 
said the clashes started sunday and continued through wednesday 
the official islamic republic news agency said today that 
montazeri wrote to the citys residents asking them to thwart any 
action against the islamic republic that might be taken in his 
name but irna which was monitored in nicosia did not say a 
riot had occurred in najafabad 
montazeri who in recent weeks openly criticized the 
shortcomings of the 10yearold islamic revolution and called for 
greater freedom stepped down march 28 after khomeini wrote him a 
letter telling him to quit 
khomeinis decision to dump the 64yearold cleric was seen as 
part of a crackdown on more moderate members of the senior iranian 
leadership 
the mujahedeen khalq report telexed to the associated press in 
nicosia said najafabad was under curfew and authorities had set up 
traffic checkpoints it reported numerous arrests in the 
disturbances in najafabad and other central iranian cities of 
yazdanshahr amirabad and imam 
irna reported montazeris letter in a dispatch from tehran in 
which irans chief justice ayatollah musavi ardebili denied that 
montazeris ouster signaled that the goverment was involved in a

with montazeris letter irna reported he wrote it for those who 
wanted to muddy the waters irna quoted ardebili as saying 
ardebili said nothing more about the letter irna reported but

asked him to step down as part of his campaign to revive what he 
called irans flagging revolutionary spirit

house speaker jim wright telephoned a former 
aide last year and asked him to sign an affidavit stating that the 
aide had volunteered to work on the speakers book reflections 
of a public man according to testimony given to the ethics 
committee investigating wrights finances 
the testimony also alleges that wright at a breakfast meeting 
early in 1985 asked congressional aides to help set up promotional 
events for the book according to sources familiar with the 
deposition of former wright aide matthew cossolotto 
wrights directive was followed in the next month or so by book 
signings at a capitol hill bookstore and the national press club a 
distribution of copies paid for by lobbyists to democrats 
attending a party conference and by an appearance on a televised 
talk show 
an aide to wright mark johnson called cossolotto a 
disgruntled former employee but did not deny the speaker had 
directed staff members to sell books 
the ethics committee which met behind closed doors to continue 
its deliberations today is looking into whether wright used bulk 
sales of the book to circumvent limits on outside income from 
speaking and writing fees 
cossolotto testified to the panel that after a newspaper 
reported last june that he had helped complile and edit the book 
including a threeweek trip to fort worth to oversee final 
preparation for printing he telephoned the speaker when wright 
called him back he asked cossolotto to sign an affidavit swearing 
to the voluntary nature of the job assignment 
the former aide told the committee he considered the book work 
part of his official job assignment and declined to sign the 
affidavit 
johnson disputed that version of events saying cossolotto had 
volunteered at first to give an affidavit then backed out 
wright acknowledged wednesday that in at least one instance 
the sale of 504 copies of the book to southwest texas state 
university in lieu of a 3000 speaking fee he had given his 
assent to the deal 
in that case the suggestion to sell books came from a staff 
member wright said 
in at least one other case the march 1986 sale of 1000 worth 
of books in lieu of a speaking fee from midcontinent oil and gas 
association the suggestion to buy books also came from a wright 
staff aide according to a source familiar with the transaction 
wright was to ship the books not to the trade group but to schools 
in texas the source said 
one ethics committee member who did not wish to be identified 
cknowledged thursday that the issue of book promotion was before 
the panel but it was unclear how serious the committee considers 
that issue 
the ethics panel is expected to reach some conclusion in its 
ninemonth investigation of wright sometime next week said 
chairman julian dixon dcalif sources have said the panel is 
concentrating on the book sales and wrights financial dealings 
with his friend george mallick a fort worth real estate developer 
as the panel resumed deliberations today dixon said the 
contract of its special outside counsel richard phelan was being 
extended through july 1 
if the committee were to find cause to recommend sanctions 
against wright the speaker would have 21 days to respond under the 
panels rules then the committee would have an additional 30 days 
to decide whether to recommend disciplinary action to the full 
house 
a twomonth extension of the contract could cover that time 
period but dixon said you cant read anything into the request 
for an extension 
both dixon and rep john myers rind also said today that 
committee precedent would call for eventual public release of the 
full report by phelan on all six original counts against wright 
regardless of whether the panel agrees with them that position 
apparently is at odds with that of members of the house democratic 
leadership who have argued the panel should release only those 
parts of the report which support its conclusions

atlantis five astronauts boarded 
their spaceship today in a successful countdown test for the first 
space shuttle planetary mission 
wearing bulky space suits the crew members for the 29th shuttle 
mission entered the cabin for the final two hours of the rehearsal 
to run through launch day procedures 
the exercise ended as planned five seconds before the count 
reached zero 
at this point everything appears to have gone as planned 
said nasa spokesman hugh harris a number of technical problems 
were built into the countdown just to ensure that we do have the 
capability of both solving problems and stopping the countdown 
should a problem occur on launch day 
the twoday countdown test which began thursday duplicates 
much of the actual count except that the fuel tank is not loaded 
and some procedures are shortened 
also being monitored was the magellan spacecraft in the cargo 
bay after reaching orbit the astronauts are to release this 378 
million payload on a mission to map the cloudhidden surface of the 
planet venus 
after a 466day outward trip magellan is to sweep into orbit 
around earths nearest planetary neighbor and aim a highpowered 
imaging radar at the surface during 243 days the radar is to send 
back the sharpest images yet of much of this mysterious planet 
nasa is aiming for an atlantis liftoff on april 28 but admits 
the schedule is tight shuttle managers are to meet next friday to

president bush firmly refused today to discuss 
his role in the reagan administrations secret plan to aid the 
contra rebels saying he did not want to prejudice the trial of 
former white house aide oliver north 
the legal process ought to run unfettered without you or me 
interfering the president told a reporter who asked him to square 
his previous statements on the affair with courtroom disclosures on 
thursday that suggested a greater role than had been known 
bush said the material presented to the north jury has been 
available to government prosecutors and congressional 
investigators previously and has been reviewed by them for any 
special significance he would not answer a questioner who quoted 
edmund muskie a member of a white house investigating panel as 
saying that some of the material looked new to him 
i stand by my statement about the irancontra committee 
bush said 
bush began his news conference with a statement increasing the 
federal role in cleaning up the aftermath of the alaska oil spill 
he ordered us armed forces personnel to assist in the cleanup 
saying we all share the sorrow and concern of alaskans 
exxons efforts standing alone are not enough he said but 
emphasizing that the giant oil firm would continue to be 
responsible and liable for the accident he defended himself from 
criticism that it had taken too long for him to provide federal 
help to the cleanup effort 
on other matters bush 
said he was unwilling to compromise with democrats who seek a 
larger increase in the minimum wage 
expressed some satisfaction with recent talks on middle east 
peace efforts 
defended himself from criticism by mikhail gorbachev that his 
administration was slow to develop an initiative for arms reduction 
said developments in poland were mindboggling because of 
the pace of reform i think it is a sign of the change of 
democratization this is all very encouraging 
he said he had not decided whether he should consider a return 
visit to the east european country 
bush announced the alaska developments during an appearance in 
the white house briefing room at which he was accompanied by 
cabinet members and alaskan members of congress questions quickly 
turned to other matters including soviet affairs much to bushs 
frustration 
concerning the irancontra affair he said the independent 
counsel and congressional committees had access to the material 
made public at the north trial 
asked what his pledge meant not to talk further on the subject 
he replied it means ive said all im going to say abouton 
the advice of lawyers 
please accept it when ive said im not going to talk about it 
anymore 
so nice try he said to the reporter 
he reacted brusquely when asked about soviet suggestions that 
the united states wasnt keeping pace with soviet moves in arms 
reduction gorbachev on a visit to britain said through a 
spokesman on thursday that continuity is the name of the game we 
are a little bit apprehensive we could be losing it 
bush said there was no delay in his administrations development 
of policy regarding nuclear weapons negotiations and foreign policy 
we are making a prudent review bush said mr 
gorbachev knows there is no footdragging going on and im not 
concerned in the least 
bush also said he hoped his meetings this week with egyptian 
president hosni mubarak and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
had produced some improvements in the peace prospects in the middle 
east he said sometimes small steps can be important 
bush also emphatically refused to raise his proposal for a 
higher minimum wage despite democratic pressure to force him to do 
so 
i have no intention of budging one inch on this i have too 
much at stake said bush who appears headed for a veto 
confrontation with the democratic majorities of congress over the 
issue 
the president opened his midmorning news conference at the 
white house with the announcement that after two weeks he had 
ordered military personnel to assist in the cleanup of the 
disastrous oil spill in prince william sound 
members of alaskas congressional delegation and highranking 
administration officials joined him at the white house press room 
podium as the president predicted the effort would be massive 
prolonged and frustrating 
our ultimate goal must be the complete restorationm of the 
ecology and the economy of prince william sound including all of 
its fish marine mammals birds and wildlife bush said 
an exxon oil tanker hit a wellmarked reef in the sound two 
weeks ago resulting in a 10million gallon oil spill bush said 
his decision to deploy federal troops to help in the cleanup 
operation should not in any way relieve exxon from any of its 
responsibilities or its liabilities 
in london earlier today gorbachev promised deep cuts in the 
soviet military and announced he would close two more nuclear 
reactors that produce weaponsgrade plutonium asked for his 
appraisal bush deflected the question we will react when we are 
ready to react he said

on irancontra bush said ive said all i want to say about 
it because i really believe on the advice of lawyers that thats 
the last thing we ought to do is even be kicking it aroundso 
please accept it when i said i dont want to talk about it any more 
and im not going to 
material presented to the jury at norths trial in federal court 
on thursday depicted bush as more involved than previously believed 
in the reagan administrations secret plan to aid the contras bush 
went to a meeting with thenpresident robert suazo in 1985 
carrying a promise of additional us aid for example honduras 
was supplying the contras at the time 
there was no indication in the courtroom material that bush 
linked the speeded up us aid with the honduran assistance for the 
contras but in earlier testimony former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane said the aid was part of a secret agreement 
designed to funnel aid to the rebels battling the sandinista 
government in nicaragua 
it wasnt the first time bush has been asked to explain his role 
in the irancontra affair that became the biggest scandal of the 
reagan administration 
he faced a barrage of questions early last year during the 
campaign for the republican presidential nomination including one 
heated exchange with cbs anchorman dan rather and then later 
faced additional pressure on the subject from democratic candidate 
michael dukakis throughout he insisted he did not know of the 
diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to iran to the contras 
and said he had little involvement in the contra aid effort

presidentelect alfredo cristiani of el 
salvador today rejected a demand by salvadoran rebels that he 
declare his forthcoming administration a transitional government 
and call for new elections 
cristianis comment came at a news conference on a plan outlined 
by rebel representatives on thursday calling for negotiations for 
a ceasefire after which elections would be held within six months 
i believe this is a setback in the progress that has been made 
in dialogue with the rebel farabundo marti national liberation 
front cristiani said 
he said it also was starting to show that the rebel faction 
does not really want peace but rather is simply trying to play a 
political game in which they are trying to pretend to be looking 
for a peaceful solution but simply creating more and more obstacles 
as things go along 
i would definitely not consider our government a transitional 
goverment unless you put it in a fiveyear term cristiani said 
with the next election to be held in 1994 
however he said his government will be willing to talk with 
the rebels to try to seek a way by which they can incorporate 
themselves into the process 
cristianis press conference came a few hours before a scheduled 
meeting at the white house with president bush 
asked whether he was satisified with the present level of us 
economic aid to el salvador cristiani said i think the aid 
package in itself is reasonable i think it is something that you 
can work with obviously the problems are so big that we would like 
to see the aid package increased but we certainly understand the 
problems that the united states has with its own budget 
two young women who did not identify themselves were hustled out 
of the room by security men after they rose and shouted questions 
about charges linking cristianis arena party to death squads 
in response to a reporters question about the death squads 
later the salvadoran presidentelect said such activity has been 
diminishing and is the work of individuals mostly in the armed 
forces and security forces taking matters into their own 
hands he said his governments policy would be to hold these 
people responsible for their acts 
outside the national press building where the news conference 
was held a small band of demonstrators shouted cristiani you 
cant hide we charge you with genocide 
the rebel proposal also demands that us aid to the salvadoran 
government be halted and us military advisers withdrawn 
the future government can choose between two options said 
francisco altschul a representative of the political opposition 
commission of the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
it can be a government which will deepen the war or it can be a 
government of transition towards peace 
the rebel plan calls for negotiations leading to a ceasefire 
after which an election would be held within six months with 
military forces of both sides barred from polling places 
cristiani the candidate of the rightwing arena party was elected 
march 19 in an election which the rebels had sought to have 
postponed 
the state department has said the united states recognizes the 
results of the balloting despite the arena partys past links to 
rightwing death squad activities us officials say the death 
squads are now substantially less active than they were during 
their peak in the early 1980s 
after the election the guerrillas escalated attacks on 
government installations in the 9yearold war against the 
ussupported government more than 70000 salvadorans most of 
them civilians have been killed since the war began

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference friday concerning the alaskan oil spill and other issues 
well i have a statement and then would be glad to take a few 
questions and then refer them to our experts here but virtually 
every american is familiar with the tragic environmental disaster 
in alaskan waters and more than 10 million gallons of oil have 
been spillled with deadly results for wildlife and hardship for 
local citizens 
we all share the sorrow and concern of alaskans and the 
determination to mount a sustained cleanup effort our ultimate 
goal must be the complete restoration of the ecology and the 
economy of prince william sound including all of its fish marine 
mammals birds and other wildlife 
the exxon corp has acknowledged responsibility for this spill 
and its liability for the damages exxon should remain responsible 
for both damages and for employing civilian personnel necessary to 
control further damage however exxons efforts standing along 
are not enough and after consulting with a congressional 
delegation sen ted stevens sen frank murkowski congressman 
don young i have determined to add additional federal resources 
to the cleanup effort in addition to the considerable federal 
personnel and equipment already on the scene 
and this new effort will focus on the job of helping recover oil 
now in the water and restoring beaches and other damaged areas 
this effort should not in any way relieve exxon from any of its 
responsibilities or its liabilities ive asked sam skinner our 
secretary of transportation to serve as the coordinator of the 
efforts of all federal agencies involved in the cleanup and to work 
with the alaskan authorities and exxon 
adm paul yost the commandant of the coast guard will return 
to alaska to assume the personal oversight of developments as we 
all know the coast guard has many assets in place right now 
also at my direction defense secretary dick cheney will make 
available us armed forces personnel and equipment to assist in 
the cleanup the military will provide personnel for direct cleanup 
activities as well as assisting with logistics the needs of 
logistics related to the cleanup and of course these efforts must 
be undertaken carefully so that further damage to fragile areas 
will not occur intensive planning now going on as well as 
appropriate cleanup training will be completed before ground units 
are actually deployed 
in addition to the department of defense personnel id ask my 
staff to develop plans to enable volunteers to participate in 
cleanup activities by summer we hope to have developed facilities 
to enable us to accommodate a corps of alaskan volunteers and when 
i say develop facilities these gentlemen will tell you were 
dealing with very remote areas in some cases here 
ive asked epa administrator bill reilly to coordinate the 
longrange planning to restore the environment of the sound epa 
will draw on the expertise of leading scientists and oil spill 
experts in this work itll also consult with other federal 
agencies that are assessing scientific data regarding the effects 
of the spill 
well not forget the residents of alaska who have suffered 
extraordinary economic loss and when you talk to these 
congressmen as i have and get it brought home on a casebycase 
basis we have to be concerned and we are concerned in addition to 
paying damage claims against it we encourage exxon to increase its 
local hiring for the cleanup efforts secretary skinner will also 
work with exxon and appropriate agencies to develop appropriate 
loan assistance programs to assist those who have suffered 
economic injury 
this situation has demonstrated the inadequacy of existing 
contingency plans and consequently i have directed a nationwide 
review of contingency plans of this type to determine improvements 
that may be necessary 
in describing these measures we should not be under any 
illusions the job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the 
affected land areas will be massive prolonged and frustrating 
nothing we can do will totally resolve this problem in the 
shortterm rather we must be prepared for a long sustained 
effort 
learning from this experience we also rededicate ourselves to 
transportation safety and to realistic planning for accidents that 
do occur at the same time our national security interest in the 
domestic energy supply should not be forgotten the excellent 
safety record that was recorded prior to this incident must be 
restored and maintained consistently into the future 
secretary skinner and administrator reilly will make brief 
statements and they secretary cheney and others will be 
available to answer questions prior to that let me just take a 
couple of questions and then i want to keep the focus if possible 
on this so fire away yeah

the election of peoples deputies of the ussr which was 
held in a democratic atmosphere unprecedented in our entire 
history has demonstrated that soviet people are not going to turn 
off the path chosen four years ago 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we were not wrong about what counts most it is also true 
however that the magnitude of many domestic problems political 
economic social and moral was not evident at once but revealed 
itself as the process moved on that calls for fresh approaches and 
solutions and most intense intellectual and practical work 
as for the difficulties and they do exist we accept them as 
a natural expression of contradictions inherent in a transition 
period 
</TEXT>

despite the exceptional changes that our society has undergone 
in the last four years despite the obvious fact that we are 
already living in a different intellectual and political climate 
moving at a different historical pace we still believe that this 
is only the beginning of the road for us perestroika takes time 
patience perseverance and consistent pursuit 
we are aware that tests and trials are still ahead for us we 
are faced with problems resulting from a lack of political culture 
and the imperfection of mechanisms that safeguard democracy and 
protect it against destructive antisocial actions 
</TEXT>

we are building an open democratic and free society which has 
learned the lessons of its past a society based on law and

recent experience testifies to the possibility of a peaceful 
order based on the principles of freedom of choice and balance of 
interests in the context of reducing weapons arsenals and lowering 
the level of military confrontation we will continue to prove this 
with our deeds 
i take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently 
decided to cease this year the production of enriched weapongrade 
uranium 
in addition to the industrial reactor for the production of 
weaponsgrade plutonium shut down in 1987 we plan to shut down two 
other such reactors this and next year without commissioning new 
units to replace them this is yet another major step towards the 
complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for use 
in weapons 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we have already stated that we are going soon to make public our 
defense budget data this will be done by the new supreme soviet of 
the ussr the difficulty here is that the nonconvertibility of the 
ruble hampers an objective comparison of our military expenditures 
with those of the west we are looking for the most appropriate way 
of presenting our data 
</TEXT>

in this regard the vienna document and the start of the talks on 
reductions in the armed forces and armaments in europe and on 
confidencebuilding measures are an event without precedent in the 
nuclear age the soviet union is prepared to take very farreaching 
steps toward a demilitarization of europe and in the overall 
european process 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
so of course there can be no doubt that if for instance nato 
goes ahead with its program of modernizing tactical nuclear 
weapons this is bound to affect the vienna talks 
confidencebuilding measures and the situation in europe in 
general this is bound to devalue much of what has been achieved 
under the inf treaty 
in this context it is appropriate for me to recall once again 
that britain contributed to creating conditions for making the 
treaty possible 
we strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear 
weapons we are not modernizing nor do we intend to modernize them 
unless we are made to i believe that common sense will prevail

organizers of this weekends march for 
abortion rights said today they expect the demonstration to be 
their largest ever and to help reshape the debate on abortion 
their numbers expected to be at least double the 90000 who 
marched here in 1986 will let the bush administration and the 
supreme court know women will not go back to the days of illegal 
abortion said molly yard president of the national organization 
for women 
we hope the march will be so big that the supreme court will 
get the message yard said if the supreme court reverses its 
1973 roe vs wade ruling that legalized abortion the law will 
not be obeyed she said 
now and the fund for the feminist majority also today released a 
20minute videotape intended to counter the righttolife 
movements film the silent scream which depicts abortion as 
murder 
the prochoice film abortion for survival is intended to 
show what abortion is why its needed and why the medical 
establishment of our society and worldwide are for keeping it 
legal said eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist 
majority 
the videotape will be distributed to members of congress state 
legislators and to students on college campuses 
as march organizers were releasing details of their 
demonstration on sunday representatives from antiabortion 
organizations were holding their own press conference where they 
called the prochoice demonstration a death march and pledged 
to continue working to end abortion on demand 
olivia gans director of american victims of abortion said 
our organization is here to support equal rights for unborn women 
specifically the right to life 
on thursday organizers of the prochoice march said tens of 
thousands of students from 500 college campuses are coming mothers 
are bringing their daughters and granddaughters a delegation from 
capitol hill will be there and dozens of celebrities are flying in 
from hollywood 
we have been silent far too long said kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
the goal is to make the weekend a turning point in the national 
abortion debate organizers feel antiabortion forces have focused 
the question on when life begins prochoice advocates say the 
issue really is whether the government should intervene in what 
they believe should be a private decision 
nobody likes abortion its a difficult choice and there are a 
lot of issues that women have to weigh when faced with a crisis 
pregnancy michelman said women dont have abortions they 
want they have abortions they need 
organizers are reluctant to predict the size of the 
demonstration but they expect it will be far larger than a march 
1986 proabortion rally of about 90000 in washington 
at least one antiabortion group plans to mount a 
counterdemonstration of up to 300 people on the day of the march 
this weekends march is intended to send a strong message to the 
supreme court justices considering a missouri case that could 
reverse or severely limit the high courts 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion oral arguments in the case are 
scheduled for later this month 
the reagan administration pushed to overturn roe vs wade and 
failed but president bush is continuing the pressure as one of 
his first acts as president in january bush addressed by telephone 
an antiabortion rally of about 65000 outside the white house 
he has thrown down the gauntlet yard said 
march organizers say women are responding with what they believe 
will be a record outpouring of support since the 1986 march the 
number of organizations endorsing the march has doubled to more 
than 400 and the number of college campuses participating also has 
doubled 
its going to reshape the debate on abortion said eleanor 
smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority until 
now everybody said the other side antiabortion is a minority 
but is stronger and has more political clout you cant say that 
any more were going to show a tremendous outpouring of commitment 
and feeling 
anne archer national public advocacy chairman for planned 
parenthood said today on cbs this morning that with regard to 
the 1973 abortion ruling i feel we have a danger of having it 
reversed and even if its not it will become so difficult to get 
one an abortion it will be almost as if its illegal 
people have forgotten what it was like prior to 1973 when 
abortion was illegal the backalley abortions how women felt 
how desperate they could be what they would do to get them and how 
many women died she said the mortality rate dropped fivefold 
when abortion was legalized

a man confessed to a priest that he had 
killed his 2yearold child and her mother and stuffed their 
bodies in a refrigerator said the priest who persuaded the man to 
surrender to authorities 
stephen a vrabel 32 of struthers did not enter a plea when 
charged with two counts of aggravated murder in struthers municipal 
court today judge robert kalafut set bond at 2 million and 
appointed an attorney for the suspect who said he didnt want a 
lawyer 
vrabel turned himself in thursday to authorities after spending 
30 minutes in a confessional with the rev john carlin pastor of 
st charles roman catholic church in parma a cleveland suburb 
he told me that he has killed his wife and daughter carlin 
said in a telephone interview thursday 
the confession in the confessional is a movie scenario said 
carlin 39 who has been a priest for 13 years yes i was 
scared 
the child lisa clemente was found bundled with two teddy 
bears blankets and a pillow and stuffed into the freezer 
compartment of their apartment refrigerator said struthers 
detective dean phillips 
he said the body of the mother susan clemente 29 was in the 
refrigerator compartment with blankets sheets and a pillow tied 
around her with rope the refrigerator shelves had been removed 
the woman and child each were shot in the head with a 
smallcaliber pistol phillips said authorities think they had 
been dead for about a week when their bodies were found wednesday 
evening 
apparently the reason he turned himself in is he heard the 
news media reports thursday about the bodies being found 
phillips said at a news conference after the arraignment 
officials said that they were unsure whether ms clemente and 
vrabel were married 
carlin said he would never have broken the secrecy demanded in 
confession but twice was told by the man to help him explain to 
police what had happened 
when they talked with police carlin said the guy was not 
being real specific he told me well you tell them what i said 
 
vrabel repeated to carlin in front of three police officers his 
permission to have his confession of guilt disclosed the priest 
said 
carlin said he had never met vrabel who apparently was driving 
through the neighborhood and spotted the church parma is about 60 
miles northwest of struthers a youngtown suburb 
vrabel approached the priest who was hearing confessions after 
their talk they drove to police headquarters where police found a 
22caliber pistol in his car after obtaining a search warrant 
during the arraignemnt this morning vrabel told the judge he 
had last worked about six months ago and didnt have any income 
kalafut said investigators found beer cans throughout the 
apartment and a type of gas mask that he said is often used in drug 
use 
certainly this ranks as one of the most gruesome slayings in 
the area in my 26 years as judge kalafut said he said a 
preliminary hearing would be held within 10 days 
vrabel held at the struthers jail was to be transferred to the 
mahoning county jail to await trial phillips said 
ms clemente lived in a twostory apartment building in 
struthers with her daughter and vrabel said ms clementes uncle

portauprince haiti ap soldiers loyal to lt gen prosper 
avril failed again today to put down a rebellion by troops 
stationed near the presidential palace 
the us ambassador offered washingtons support for the 
government which foiled a coup attempt sunday but has been unable 
to quell the mutiny 
rebel soldiers were 200 yards from the presidential palace 
which was guarded by loyal troops antiaircraft guns and cannons 
witnesses said loyalists killed four mutineers in a street of 
the capital thursday night and a diplomat confirmed two of the 
deaths four other rebel troops have been killed since sunday 
streets of this normally bustling capital of 1 million people 
were deserted this morning under a state of emergency stores 
schools and offices were closed airlines canceled flights into 
haitis international airport 
haitians were cut off from developments because radio stations 
either were not broadcasting news or were off the air their cables 
cut by government troops apparently for violating military 
censorship imposed by the state of emergency cables were cut at 
radios antilles inter metropole and liberte 
a grenade thrown thursday night by rebel troops knocked out the 
transmitter tower at the state television station said news 
director annaise chavanet 
the deep divisions in the military were seen as a sign that more 
disorder may be imminent because haitian soldiers rarely kill each 
other 
the rebels are demanding that avril step down they accuse the 
government of favoritism toward the presidential guard in pay and 
living conditions and of arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in 
a crackdown on drugs and corruption 
members of the 400man leopards commando unit and troops from 
the 700man dessalines barracks the most repressive unit in 
haitis 7000man army were involved in the mutiny but it was not 
known how many 
the dessalines barracks abuts the national palace protected by 
members of avrils 1000man presidential guard 
the nearby us consulate closed as a security precaution an 
official said its operations were moved to the us embassy which 
is several blocks away and remained open 
a witness said an armored car carrying loyal soldiers of the 
presidential guard on thursday night chased a stolen army truck 
carrying members of the leopards unit that shot in the air as they 
drove up and down on a road 
the rebels fled into a house and the loyalist troops destroyed 
it with highcaliber machine gunfire killing the four and wounding 
one said the witness speaking on condition of anonymity 
us ambassador brunson mckinley called on avril at the palace 
and expressed support for his government the united states is 
reassured by democratization under avril an embassy statement 
said thursday 
since coming to power six months ago in a coup avril has 
restored some constitutional rights suspended in 1987 and approved 
the establishment of an electoral council to prepare for elections 
the embassy statement said it appears probable that sundays 
coup attempt was organized by exiles linked to ousted dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier who fled to france in 1986 
avrils government has imposed military censorship and most 
radio stations abbreviated or canceled newscasts thursday 
radio soleil the roman catholic station reported one man 
killed and three people wounded in shootings wednesday and thursday 
the government has blamed sundays coup attempt on a vast 
campaign against drug trafficking contraband and corruption that 
collided with the interests of those who oppose democratic 
change 
the united states has made the crackdown a condition for the 
resumption of 70 million in aid that it suspended after thugs 
killed 34 voters in november 1987 thwarting haitis first free 
elections in more than 30 years 
the coup attempt sunday was foiled when loyal soldiers rescued 
avril as he was being escorted in handcuffs to the airport to be 
deported 
avril 50 came to power in a coup led by noncommissioned 
officers demanding democratic reforms and an end to statesponsored 
violence the coup ousted lt gen henri namphy

president bush pledging us help in seeking 
a mideast settlement today described the situation in the troubled 
region as marginally improved 
referring to a plan by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to 
hold elections among palestinian arabs living under israeli control 
in the west bank and gaza the president said 
in the middle east a little step sometimes can be fruitful i 
think the climate is better than it has been 
bush meeting with reporters at the white house said in 
response to a question that it was too early for him to consider 
traveling to the region to try to resolve the arabisraeli conflict 
if i personally can be helpful i am going to do it bush 
said 
but he added it is not a time when a lot of highvisibility 
missions on the part of the president can be helpful in the 
process 
as for the proposed elections which shamir suggested as a way 
to select arab delegates to meet with his goverment bush said 
we havent fully resolved exactly whos going to have a role 
thats a matter to be determined between the parties the plo 
has people living on the west bank we want to see elections 
that are free and fair 
shamirs intent is to avoid plo participation in selecting arab 
representatives by having israeli authorities run the selection 
process 
shamir presented his proposal to bush on thursday at a news 
conference the prime minister ruled out having international 
observers on hand for the voting still secrertary of state james 
a baker iii said he was encouraged about mideast prospects 
i think the important thing is that his proposal comes with 
something that can be worked with baker said thursday it 
offers us an opportunity to perhaps move the peace process forward 
and i think thats encouraging 
shamir who was meeting today with members of congress said 
israelis and palestinians would oversee the balloting he intends to 
hold on the west bank and in gaza 
we do not think there is a need of international 
supervision he said israel has a long tradition of democracy 
and decent and honest elections 
shamir said he thinks that a majority of the 14 million 
palestinian arabs living under israeli control would participate in 
the election they are waiting for a peaceful solution he said 
the territories have been plagued with violence since 
palestinians began an uprising in december 1987 a total of 420 
palestinians and 18 israelis have died in the unrest 
shamir who blames the plo for the violence acknowledged the 
plo was likely to oppose the election they want the immediate 
establishment of an independent palestinian state shamir said 
his plan calls for the election of palestinian leaders to 
negotiate temporary selfrule after a trial period shamir 
proposes to have israel palestinians egypt and jordan work out a 
permanent settlement 
we do not want to run the lives of the inhabitants shamir 
said in a speech thursday we want them to have selfrule 
but he again opposed establishment of a palestinian state on the 
west bank and in gaza which shamir said can only be a convenient 
launching pad for terrorist attacks against the center of our 
country 
without the territories israel at its most densely populated 
center is as wide as the distance between the white house and chevy 
chase a washington suburb shamir said 
while giving a qualified endorsement of the principle of holding 
elections bush emphasized that israel eventually must relinquish 
the land the arabs lost in the 1967 sixday war 
bush said he told shamir we do not support an independent 
palestinian state nor israeli sovereignty over or permanent 
occupation of the west bank and gaza 
by mentioning israeli sovereignty bush went a step beyond 
his statement monday that israel must end the occupation of the 
territory and that in itself indicated a hardening us stance 
shamir in his speech did not challenge bush directly but he 
called the idea of israel trading territory for peace which other 
presidents have endorsed a hoax 
the choice is not between israel keeping the territories or 
risking war shamir said the opposite is true if we leave 
there will almost certainly be war 
the election would determine the makeup of a palestinian 
delegation to negotiate with israel for an interim period of 
selfgoverning administration shamir said that would be 
followed by negotiations for a permanent agreement he said 
baker speaking later to reporters at the state department said 
he was encouraged by the proposition 
there is something new in this proposal he said it is 
new the concept of elections before you go to transitional 
arrangements that is new 
still baker said there are a number of questions that 
have to be fleshed out and answered but it gives people who are 
interested in trying to move the peace process forward something to 
work with

a 26yearold stabbing victim whose 
lifesupport system was disconnected eight days ago over the 
objections of his assailant died today nearly four years after the 
attack left him in a coma 
sylvia lane said her son mark weaver died at about 2 am he 
died peacefully he never had a moments pain she said 
noel pagan who served three years in prison for stabbing weaver 
during a street fight in 1985 fought unsuccessfully in court last 
week to force weavers family to keep him alive on a feeding tube 
prosecutors said pagan now on probation could face a murder 
charge once weaver died but they need a cause of death before they 
can decide whether to seek charges 
the medical examiner will conduct an autopsy and make a report 
to us and then we will make a decision attorney general james 
e tierney said today 
tierney declined to say what sort of finding would be necessary 
before a murder charge could be sought 
im not going to answer any hypothetical questions about an 
autopsy being conducted tierney said he did not know how soon 
to expect autopsy results 
pagans lawyer robert mullen said last week he would try to 
persuade prosecutors to file no additional charges in the case 
although he declined to appeal the ruling from probate judge dana 
childs that allowed weavers family to remove the feeding tube just 
after midnight on march 30 the judge said pagan had no right to 
intervene in weavers care 
mullen today declined to predict whether his client will face 
charges but he said if charges are lodged he will file motions to 
get them thrown out 
the first two that come to mind are double jeopardy and the 
socalled yearandaday rule mullen said under that legal 
provision which was cited in at least two maine cases a person 
must die a year and a day after an event to be charged with murder 
or manslaughter he said 
the attorney for weavers family charles kadish did not answer 
phone calls this morning 
funeral services were being arranged by the family

q mr president 
a oh my protocol sorry about that 
q thank you mr president 
a sorry 
q if i could try another subject how do you reconcile your 
efforts to arrange thirdcountry military aid for the contras with 
the spirit of the ban by congress on aid to the rebels 
a look i am not going to comment on any aspect of the north 
trial while its in progress 
if i even commented on your question it could prejudice the 
trial thats going to be and that would be totally unfair 
and i would note that of all the material that you seem to be 
referring to and that has been introduced all the material that 
was introduced yesterday material youre referring to has been 
available to the independent counsel and the irancontra 
committee and has been reviewed by them for any special 
significance 
so i believe the legal process ought to run unfettered without 
you or me endangering the trial process thats going on right now 
and thats the last question ill take on that subject 
yes right here and then to frank 
q do you have any reply to mr gorbachevs inaudible your 
foreign policy review inaudible 
a this is an environmental briefing here and were concerned 
about the alaska oil spill 
but the answer is no 
let me simply say were the united states of america were 
making a prudent review and i will be ready to discuss that with 
the soviets when we are ready 
and so and mr gorbachev knows that theres no footdragging 
going on so im not concerned in the least 
now we go ok 
q a number of local officials in alaska as well as alaskan 
residents have been inaudible virtually since the spill took 
place for a greater federal role i guess my question would be why 
has it taken so long to reach this conclusion and hasnt valuable 
time been lost during your deliberations 
a well as you may recall action started immediately 
the big thing was to get the ship stop the hemorrhaging and 
get that ship moved 
i immediately asked the head of the coast guard and the head of 
the department of transportation and bill reilly to go up there 
they came back and upon sound advice recommended that we not 
federalize and let me be clear we are not federalizing this 
operation 
there is no demand from reasonable people to federalize this 
operation and that is not going to be done

mikhail gorbachev today announced the soviet union 
is halting production of weaponsgrade uranium and will shut down 
two more nuclear reactors that produce plutonium for nuclear 
weapons by the end of next year 
in a halfhour speech in londons guildhall the soviet 
president called his unilateral action another major step toward 
the complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for 
use in weapons 
arms experts said today that while uranium and plutonium are 
both used in soviet nuclear weapons plutonium is used more often 
and that moscow has enough on hand to produce more weapons 
prime minister margaret thatcher told reporters the soviet move 
will have no effect in practice because they probably have 
quite a sufficient stockpile of uranium 
in washington president bush declined to comment on gorbachevs 
announcement saying he had not had time to review it 
a pentagon official said the steps outlined by gorbachev would 
not have a major impact on the soviet capability to wage war 
gorbachev reiterated promises he made at the united nations in 
december that the soviet union would soon begin paring 500000 men 
from its standing army and withdrawing troops and tanks from europe 
and the chinese frontier 
gorbachev made a strong appeal for world disarmament but he 
warned the process could falter if the west did not reciprocate 
after the address broadcast live throughout britain and the 
united states gorbachev and his wife raisa called on queen 
elizabeth ii at windsor castle then left for moscow at the end of 
a sixday trip to ireland cuba and britain 
gorbachev invited the queen to visit the soviet union she said 
she would like to accept but that her foreign travel is always 
fixed years in advance 
queen elizabeth ii would be the first monarch to go to russia 
since her grandfathers cousin czar nicholas ii and his family 
were killed after the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
speaking at guildhall the citys seat of government for 1000 
years gorbachev said the world has reached a crossroad in which it 
has to choose between peaceful interdependency and a policy of 
force rooted in the past 
if nato goes ahead with its program of modernizing tactical 
nuclear weapons he said this is bound also to devalue much of 
what has been achieved under the inf treaty on mediumrange 
nuclear weapons that he signed with president ronald reagan in 1987 
gorbachev said in addition to the industrial reactor for the 
production of weaponsgrade plutonium shut down in 1987 we plan to 
shut down two other such reactors this year and next year without 
commissioning new units to replace them 
we have completed the construction of a facility for the 
destruction of chemical weapons and indeed to invite soon your 
representatives to visit it gorbachev said 
british experts on nuclear arsenals said it was difficult to 
assess the impact of the soviet cutbacks in production of 
fissionable materials because the number of such production 
facilities is secret 
a nuclear physicist in england who also requested anonymity 
said that uranium and plutonium are both still used in nuclear 
weapons production but that plutonium is in wider use in the soviet 
union and the united states 
francois heisbourg director of the londonbased institute of 
strategic studies said gorbachevs announcement that the soviets 
would close two plutoniumproducing reactors was new 
but he said it was not as significant as it may sound because 
there is already plenty of plutonium around which the soviets can 
use to make bombs 
the pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the soviets have stockpiles of weaponsgrade materials and 
could restart production in several years when supplies run low 
reiterating earlier promises gorbachev also said armed manpower 
would be cut by 12 percent the military budget by 14 percent and 
weapons production by nearly 20 percent military factories are 
being switched to production of consumer goods and military 
transport planes would be redeployed to carry civilian cargoes he 
said 
he said the new supreme soviet a legislative body to be 
selected by the recently elected parliament will publish the 
nations defense budget most of which is now concealed 
the speech got a standing ovation from the civic and political 
leaders at guildhall and a ringing endorsement by mrs thatcher 
we want you to succeed in your task she said after the 
speech were ready to help in practical ways

so what have we done 
the flow was stopped 
and let me be very clear i give great credit certainly and 
some of those that are working out there volunteers private side 
local citizens company and everything else for stopping the 
flow 
but i also give great credit to the coast guard and to military 
assets that have already been used in moving equipment thousands of 
miles to get this get this stop the flow 
and ill tell you a lot has been done 
ive had a talk here with bill reilly about protecting the 
hatcheries 
and i dont want to make premature judgments on this but it 
looks like the five hatcheries may have been saved 
and now theres is that an overstatement inaudible 
and now the cleanup phase comes and its the time when we can 
step up some activity 
so something has gone on 
im not about to defend the status quo but there is no desire 
on our part to federalize 
were not going to do it 
and i think its fair to point this out i think their 
priorities were right 
there was four times as much oil in that ship as spilled out of 
that ship and it was important to stop to guarantee even in 
rough elements up there that no more escaped 
and so some things have happened 
it was prudent to contain that spill 
and so the process is going forward 
q mr president 
a yes brit 
q do you have a sense yet of how much this federal effort is 
going to cost and will you try to recover from exxon that amount 
a as i said exxon is liable and they will continue to be 
liable and we dont at this point have a full assessment 
lesley 
q will you take them to court on that sir to follow up will 
you take them to court 
a i think exxon has assumed liability and im not going to 
stand here and suggest otherwise 
q mr president mr gorbachev today made another arms control 
gesture saying that hell stop production of weaponsgrade uranium 
and shut down two plutonium plants whats your response or 
reaction 
a ive given you my response 
well be ready to react when we feel like reacting and when we 
have prudently made our our reviews upon which to act 
q i meant what do you think of his proposal or his offer is 
this a big step forward 
a i havent i havent seen it analyzed lesley so i honestly 
cant tell you that i know the full significance 
john 
q i know you dont want to talk about it but senator muskie 
former senator muskie who was a member of the tower commission 
says he was not aware of this effort to involve the hondurans or 
of your role you have said this was available to the tower 
commission do you want to reply to that without prejudicing

plo chief yasser arafat today 
criticized a usbacked israeli proposal for elections in 
israelioccupied territories 
the palestine liberation organization leader making the

palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip will continue 
a nearly 16monthold uprising against israeli rule until the 
ultimate victory 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs statement in 
washington is inappropriate as usual all oppressors in the

selfrule under the plan talks on the ultimate disposition of the 
occupied territories would be left until later 
president bush who has been meeting with shamir in washington 
gave qualified support to shamirs proposal thursday

part of a larger plan to end the occupation 
arafat reiterated his demand for an international peace 
conference on the middle east with the participation of the five 
permanent members of the un security council and all concerned 
parties including the plo israel refuses to negotiate with the 
plo which it considers a terrorist organization 
until the ultimate victory the uprising of the populations of 
the gaza and west bank will continue arafat said 
israeli officials have said that shamirs plan made no specific 
demand for the end of the uprising as a condition for elections

influential palestinians reacted coolly today 
to a usbacked israeli call for elections in the west bank and 
gaza strip insisting any balloting be part of a package that 
promises an end to occupation 
plo chief yasser arafat visiting congo criticized the proposal 
as inappropriate and said the nearly 16monthold palestinian 
uprising would continue until the ultimate victory 
several thousand palestinians rioted today shouting nationalist 
slogans and burning an israeli flag outside jerusalems al aqsa 
mosque 
police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence 
a day after president bush gave prime minister yitzhak shamir 
qualified support of his proposal for elections in the occupied 
lands to choose palestinian leaders who would negotiate selfrule 
the two leaders are meeting in washington 
talks on the ultimate disposition of the occupied territories 
would be left until later 
i think the intefadeh uprising will continue until shamir 
comes up with a better proposal said hanna siniora editor of 
the proplo daily al fajr newspaper 
siniora and most other palestinians interviewed today said 
israel would have to accept giving up land it seized in the 1967 
middle east war and end the military occupation over the 17 
million arabs in the west bank and gaza 
israeli newspaper editorials said the rightwing premier had won 
only a brief respite from the diplomatic pressure on israel to make 
concessions to match arafats steps in recognizing israel and 
forswearing terror 
the palestinian liberation organization leader on a visit to 
congo said shamirs statement in washington is inappropriate as 
usual all oppressors in the world have used the same 
language 
leaders of the leftleaning labor party headed by finance 
minister shimon peres were initially silent on the washington 
talks but shulamit aloni leader of the liberal citizens rights 
movement accused shamir of procrastinating 
palestinian leftists and prosyrian supporters rule out 
elections other opinion leaders expressed skepticism about 
shamirs motivation but appeared to leave the door open to further 
discussions 
in the west bank city of nablus businessman said kenaan said 
shamirs real objective was to avoid talking to the plo and 
sidetrack negotiations to a temporary solution that ignored 
palestinian demands for statehood 
nabil jabari the board chairman of hebron university who spent 
65 days in administrative detention without trial for alleged 
contacts with plo leaders said the plo would have to approve any 
election plan 
i would not agree to any election if it is only limited to 
voting and is not part of an overall package to solve the 
palestinian problem he said 
some palestinians said elections would have to be preceded by 
tensionrelieving steps such as the release of the 1187 
palestinians detained without trial allowing deported activists to 
return to stand as candidates and lifting military orders 
restricting freedom of speech and assembly 
jonathan kuttab a west bank lawyer and human rights activist 
said in an interview palestinians are not opposed to elections 
themselves but are opposed to the idea if the real objective is to 
avoid dealing with the palestinian peoples representatives the 
plo 
kuttab said laws banning contact with the plo would have to be 
lifted so any palestinians elected could serve as a bridge to the 
plo the only body that could speak for the worlds 5 million 
palestinians 
al quds the leading proplo daily in arab east jerusalem noted 
with satisfaction the us opposition to continued israeli 
occupation and its stand against israeli annexation of the land 
but it cautiously avoided comment on the elections proposal that 
bush endorsed 
in washington bush told the visiting israeli prime minister the 
united states does not suport an independent palesntinian state 
nor israeli sovereignty over or permanent occupation of the west 
bank and gaza

a no 
q mr president 
a because i dont want to prejudice the trial john 
it would be imprudent for us to do that and were not going to 
do it 
and i stand by my statement about the irancontra committee 
q will you speak after the trial 
a thats it 
q mr president the conventional wisdom is that an american 
president never has much to gain by getting personally involved in 
the middle east but i was thinking that maybe you were an 
exception given your initial round this week can you tell us 
whats in your mind about the middle east if you see yourself 
getting very personally involved over the course of your presidency 
in trying to solve this 
a look if i help if i felt that being immersed in it would 
help solve the problem of peace in the middle east i would do that 
and i think youre right there have been times when it appears 
that the president shouldnt be fully involved 
but weve had two visits here now this week president mubarak 
prime minister shamir 
well have a visit a forthcoming visit from king hussein 
and im going to give the same assurances to him ive given to 
mubarak and shamir and that is that if i personally can be 
helpful i want to do it 
and in the meantime why i will say that i cant say im 
elated but in the middle east a little step sometimes can be 
prove to be fruitful 
and i hope that i think the climate is better than its been 
in a while 
but i would simply say it is not a time where a lot of 
highvisibility missions on the part of the president can 
accommodate can be helpful in the process 
but i want to leave you with the view that it is of deep concern 
to us particularly the violence in the west bank 
and so and i think both leaders that ive talked to so far 
know my personal feelings on this 
and were not despairing 
in fact i hope the two visits have moved things forward a 
little bit 
saul 
q do your statements today mean that you wont discuss this 
contra affair 
a yes 
it means ive said all i want to say about it 
look were having a briefing on alaska and with all respect 
q mr president 
a did i cut you off 
come on oh 
q does it mean you wont discuss it until the end of the ollie 
north trial 
a it means ive said all i want to say about it because i 
really believe on the advice of lawyers that thats the last 
thing we ought to do is even be kicking it around to this end 
so please accept it when i said i dont want to talk about it 
any more and im not going to 
so nice try 
q inaudible until after the trial 
a now i just said just let it stand 
go back and interpret what i said yes

leftist rebels unveiled a new 
proposal for ending el salvadors nineyear civil war but it was 
rejected today by presidentelect alfredo cristiani 
the proposal released thursday termed illegitimate the 
landslide victory of the rightist republican nationalist alliance 
or arena in the march 19 presidential election it called on arena 
to declare itself a transitional government and for general 
elections before years end 
the rebels said the new government which is scheduled to take 
power june 1 from outgoing president jose napoleon duarte must 
choose between escalated civil war and negotiated peace 
cristiani who is in washington to meet with president bush 
said at a news conference today i would definitely not consider 
our government a transitional government unless you put it in a 
fiveyear term however he said his government will be willing 
to talk with the rebels to try to seek a way by which they can 
incorporate themselves into the process 
cristiani has said many times that the insurgents must lay down 
their arms and incorporate themselves into the democratic process 
the guerrillas say that is tantamount to a call for surrender and 
reject it 
the guerrillas have vowed to step up attacks in the coming weeks 
to demonstrate to arena the country is ungovernable without 
their consent 
thursdays guerrilla proposal was similar to one announced jan 
23 the new plan added elements resulting from subsequent talks in 
mexico between the rebels and salvadoran political party 
representatives 
the salvadoran government rejected the january proposal 
we do not believe the image campaign through which arena is 
trying to present itself as a moderate force said the guerrilla 
document signed by the five members of the insurgent high command 
after its 1981 founding arena was associated with rightwing 
death squads accused of slaying tens of thousands of suspected 
leftists 
cashiered army maj roberto daubuisson the alleged godfather 
of the death squads is an arena legislator and leader of the 
congress majority block 
cristiani maintains the party has matured into a modern 
conservative organization with an ideology similar to that of us 
republicans arena opponents say cristiani is little more than a 
pseudodemocratic veneer for a neofascist party 
arena has made it clear it will pursue a policy of slaughter 
and total war said the rebel proposal 
it alleged that arena is now virtually running the government 
despite the stillincumbent christian democratic administration it 
claimed human rights abuses have surged since the arena victory 
independent human rights monitors have said they lack enough 
data to back up that contention 
the guerrillas reiterated earlier demands that implicated army 
officers be tried and punished for rights abuses and that the army 
be reduced from its current strength of 56000 to its 1978 level of 
12000 
they also called for elimination of the three police forces and 
formation of a single police force under civilian administration 
the internal security forces currently depend on the defense 
ministry which is headed by an army general 
they said additionally that the judicial system which they 
characterized as corrupt and inefficient must be purged and 
reformed 
the rebels said that if their conditions were met the fmln 
would cease the armed struggle and incorporate itself into the 
countrys political process

q do you believe the plo should have a role in independent 
elections in israel west bank 
a i think that the answer is to get on with the elections and 
ive id like to we havent fully resolved exactly whos going 
to have a role but i think thats a matter to be determined by 
between the parties but id leave it right there 
id leave it right there 
the plo has people living on the west bank as you know and we 
want to see elections that are free and fair there 
yeah dave 
q mr president is your statement this week about israel 
ending the occupation intended as sort of a diplomatic nudge to 
prime minster shamir should we read something into that 
a i wouldnt read anything into it 
i do not feel that the provisions of security council resolution 
242 and 338 have been fulfilled 
and i wanted to be clear to all the parties in the middle east 
that that is my view 
and ive will hold the as best the us can hold the 
parties to a full implementation of those resolutions 
and so what i was signalling is is that the territory that 
has been ceded for peace is not the end 
it simply isnt 
yeah ellen 
q mr president youve used words like deadly and 
tragic and disastrous to describe this oil spill during 
the campaign you said you were an environmentalist have you had 
any opportunity to rescind your commitment to drilling in the 
arctic wildlife refuge as a result of this disaster 
a yeah i had the opportunity 
q and what have you decided 
a no i dont think that i dont think that you that you 
compromise the genuine national security interests of this country 
and i dont think that you can predicate a sound national energy 
policy on an aberration that seemed to have taken place in prince 
william sound 
and my if for those that do i say please let me follow 
logically 
are you suggesting because of the alleged human error of a pilot 
of a ship in prince william sound that we shut down all the 
offshore production in the gulf of mexico 
is that the suggestion 
if so i oppose it 
and i think weve got to do what i said in this statement do 
everything humanly possible here and elsewhere on land and on sea 
to see that we have the soundest environmental practice and reserve 
in terms of putting out fires or stemming the flow of oil that 
leaks out gets away 
but i am not going to suggest that because of this we should 
rethink a policy of trying to get this country less dependent on 
foreign oil 
yes

q mr president you said earlier that you dont want to defend 
the status quo in alaska you sounded sometimes like youre 
defending exxon are you satisified with their performance since 
the spill what have they done wrong and what could they have done 
better 
a let these experts tell you 
q mr president you have said a couple of times 
a im not satisifed with anything about it when we have a risk 
to the environment like this 
because ellen was telling you correctly i feel very very 
strongly about the damage to our environment there to the 
fisheries to the lives of people involved there and to all of that 
so i am not totally satisified 
yeah im going to take two more 
were taking too much time away from the people that are really 
most thoroughly involved at this 
besides were getting off marlins schedule 
the press aaaaawww 
bush thank you for your understanding laughter 
q let me make one more subject change if i may sir youve 
said a couple of times your minimum wage offer is your last and 
best does that mean you feel that the package being debated on the 
hill now the democrats package is worse than no bill at all sir 
a well theres several packages being debated but ive told 
you you know in terms of the increase and the length of time for 
the training wage we did something unusual 
we fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first 
and id like to take this opportunity to say what i heard 
several of our leaders saying yesterday after the meeting i have 
no intention of budging one inch on this 
and ive got too much at stake to change right now and im not 
going to 
and so thats what weve done and i know its an unusual 
procedure 
the secretary of labor made her position very very clear in 
this 
and there we are 
yes 
q i just want to ask one last question on the spill you said 
that the cleanup would be protracted how long do you think its 
going to take the number of years and is there any real expection 
this will ever be cleaned up

a business executive charged in the 
pentagon fraud case testified today that no one at his company ever 
indicated that one of the firms consultants was paying illegal 
bribes to a navy official 
dale schnittjer a former vice president at teledyne electronics 
in newbury park calif was the third of three defendants to take 
the stand in his defense in the trial in us district court 
on thursday schnittjers associates at teledyne george kaub 
and eugene sullivan also denied they knew about illegal activities 
carried out by william parkin a private consultant teledyne had 
hired in 1985 the three defendants are charged with bribery 
conspiracy wire fraud and making false statements 
schnittjers testimony came at the tail end of the defenses 
case before us district judge richard williams sent the jury 
home for the weekend thomas keenan schnittjers former boss at 
teledyne continental motors in muskegon mich testified the 
defendant is a man whose honesty and integrity were impeccable 
williams said he would ask attorneys to make their closing 
arguments on monday before letting the jury deliberate 
schnittjer sullivans successor said he arrived at teledyne 
electronics in the summer of 1987 nearly two years after parkin was 
hired for 10000 parkins 1985 contract called for him to receive 
150000 for future work should teledyne be awarded a 24 million 
contact to build handheld radar equipment the pentagon selected 
teledyne for that job in july 1987 
at a meeting of teledyne executives after the awarding of the 
contract schnittjer said there was a general feeling that 
teledyne electronics had an obligation to honor the deal with 
parkin because the radar contract had been awarded 
schnittjer said 
at the meeting schnittjer said no one indicated parkin had done 
anything illegal to help secure the contract parkin who has 
pleaded guilty in the case and is cooperating with the government 
testified he bribed a navy official for inside information about 
the radar contract 
in a related matter joseph e hill 76 of mineola ny was 
sentenced to one year unsupervised probation and fined 20000 for 
making illegal campaign contributions to congressional campaigns 
hill a private consultant pleaded guilty to the four misdemeanor 
counts earlier this year 
he acknowledged that he channeled corporate contributions to the 
campaigns of unwitting congressional candidates as part of a scheme 
organized by several former executives of unisys corp hill is one 
of about a dozen people who have pleaded guilty in the wideranging 
government investigation of pentagon procurement known as 
operation ill wind 
the only people to be tried in the case so far are schnittjer 
sullivan and kaub 
in testimony thursday sullivan and kaub said they never looked 
into what type of business parkin operated because the man had a 
stellar reputation in defense circles 
on the witness stand sullivan and kaub vehemently denied they 
knew anything about parkins illegal activities 
they said he was hired for 10000 in november 1985 to help the 
firm reverse a decision to give the contract to a minority business 
firm 
after teledyne was awarded the job parkin repeatedly called the 
teledyne executives seeking the 150000 he said was due from the 
firm because he helped the defense contractor win the bid 
during the trial the government played taperecorded 
conservations of wiretaps they had placed on the telephones of the 
defendants and parkin kaub said most of the conversations he had 
were parkin ranting and raving and i didnt pay any attention to 
it 
sullivan who occasionally used salty language was asked his 
reaction to hearing the tapes i may change my ways he said 
but both men said they had full confidence in parkins 
capabilities because he had been a respected official with the 
navy ending his government career in 1983 as the director of 
acquistions for the joint cruise missile project 
noting that parkin worked as a private consultant for a number 
of big companies such at boeing kaub said you have to make an 
assumption that he is in fact doing legitimate work 
sullivan said he knew that parkin employed associates in his 
business but he never inquired about their identities 
parkin said he had partners who were working in private 
industrythey didnt want their names revealed he said

the pastor of the church where martin 
luther king jr rose to national prominence has decided to retire 
complaining the congregation is losing the spirit that helped bring 
about social change 
the rev g murray branch 74 said he will step down as pastor 
of dexter avenue king memorial baptist church on june 30 and return 
to atlanta where he taught for many years at a seminary 
im a little weary he said but the main reason im 
leaving is there has been a demand on the church an increase in 
service but participation has declined 
the church in downtown montgomery has become a tourist 
attraction because king was its pastor when he rose to national 
prominence as leader of the montgomery bus boycott in 195556 the 
church since has been the rallying point for many civil rights 
demonstrations 
but branch said the congregation has declined to about 250 
active members and there has been a drop in community and church 
activities by the remaining members 
thats another reason im unhappy with this congregation he 
said given the laity of this congregation and the status of the 
majority of the members socially and economically they ought to 
be involved in more meaningful community service 
addre bryant chairman of the board of deacons agreed with 
branch that not everyone was participating fully it takes 
different things to motivate folks to do things some things may 
depend on the organization of the church he said there really 
has been no organization

a sweltering weekend lay ahead for southern 
californians sweating out a springtime heat wave that has packed 
beaches and prompted special patient care in a hospital left 
without air conditioning after a fire 
residents braced today for a sizzling repeat of thursdays 
weather which sent the temperature at the los angeles civic center 
soaring to 106 degrees the hottest day of the year and the 
hottest april day on record 
el toro in orange county was the hottest spot in the nation 
thursday frying at 112 degrees 
the national weather service forecast temperatures to top 100 
degrees in most of the region for a fourth straight day and issued 
a heat warning for residents urging them to sit still and drink 
plenty of water 
the record april 7 high at the civic center was 88 set in 1904 
and was certain to fall by 9 am downtown was already 82 degrees 
the forecast concerned nurses at ucla medical center who were 
giving patients tepid baths and covering them in moist towels after 
a fire thursday night knocked out air conditioning in the 
400patient hospital 
adminstrators closed the emergency room and surgeons canceled 
all elective surgery while workers scrambled through the night to 
repair the giant air conditioning units said spokesman john lewis 
the best we can hope for is to have half the air conditioning 
going by midafternoon today he said but its still dark and 
im already beginning to feel the heat coming on 
firefighters were investigating the cause of the blaze that 
struck the cooling towers on the roof of the hospital no patients 
had to be transferred as of early today 
the hot dry santa ana winds from the desert bathed the los 
angeles basin in heat from the mountains to the beaches where air 
temperatures in the 80s and 90s clashed with more seasonal water 
temperatures in the 60s 
people going to the beach and not going into the water are 
just exposing themselves to the sun said dr george gellert a 
los angeles county health official they may be better off 
remaining in the shade 
northern california had its own heat wave 
even normally mild san francisco hit a record 91 degrees on 
thursday five degrees above the previous high for that date set in 
1924

a well i think theres i think weve got to hope that it is 
i think santa barbara i would say has been pretty well cleaned 
up 
id say that the spill the amoco cadiz which was six times as 
big as this has been cleaned up 
and so i weve got to aspire to standards that make me be able 
to tell the people of alaska and people that are concerned all over 
this country yes we can shoot for that standard and we have 
history to point to 
but i think what we do now will determine how fast we can say 
that it has been done 
and thats why we want to move as quickly weve go to all 
right last one in the middle owen sorry tom 
q can you tell me if you believe the political agreement 
reached in poland this week could be a model for political reform 
throughout eastern europe and can we anticipate another visit to 
either poland or eastern europe by you this summer or this spring 
a no two eastern european countries are the same 
the striving for change in some if not all of these countries 
is the same 
but i would say that the roundtable development there in poland 
is very positive and i would certainly commend the parties getting 
together there 
i go back to when we were there not very many months ago and 
many of you were with me on that trip 
i think the situation has moved so fast since that trip that i 
took a year or two ago that its mindboggling 
and to think that youd see jaruzelski shaking hands with lech 
walesa we couldnt have predicted that a couple of years ago 
why because i was lectured very firmly about the 
solidarnosc being quote outlawed unquote 
so things are moving 
and i think its a sign of the change that democracy and 
democratization if you will and elections and parliaments and 
congresses and is on the move 
and this is and recognition of a trade unions rights to 
bargain this is all very encouraging 
but what it means to the other eastern european countries owen 
i simply cant tell you 
in terms of my own plans we have not formulated any plans yet 
id love to go back to poland sometime 
id love to go back there 
but theres no such plan 
i really do have to run and ill just turn this over now to sam 
skinner 
and i know theyll and the congressmen and senators 
q thank you very much mr president 
a not at all 
well good luck and i hope you 
q thank you very much mr president 
a we want to help and we care about whats happening up there 
in alaska

american science education is becoming obsolete 
and uncompetitive but the new president of the national science 
teachers association says its overhaul represents a new frontier 
that americans will conquer 
it has always been acceptable to say i never really 
understood science and until we change that attitude and expect 
that everyone will learn science we wont move forward said 
hans andersen professor of science and environmental education at 
indiana university at bloomington 
in spite of lots of poor science teachers we have a lot of 
teachers who are really making a significant difference with 
students this is a time for great optimism and i believe that 
this is a wave that is not going to do anything but get larger 
andersen made his comments in an interview thursday at the 
associations 37th annual conference as many as 11000 people are 
attending the seattle gathering which runs through sunday 
theres a good chance that turning around science education is 
the next great frontier for this country throughout our 
history americans have risen up to conquer frontiers and we can 
do it again and will andersen said 
only 7 percent of students who graduate from american high 
schools have enough science to continue in a college science 
program in the soviet union 85 percent are qualified for higher 
education science courses he said 
by the end of the 1990s he said there will be 45000 unfilled 
jobs in science and engineering in this country 
the lack of science expertise threatens the economy of the 
country more than any single thing said david kennedy seattle 
regional president of the association and a science adviser to the 
washington state superintendent of public instruction 
recent studies show american students do adequately memorizing 
facts but learning how to think critically how to establish and 
test hypotheses and make inferences and conclusions isnt 
happening said lamoine motz outgoing association president and 
coordinator of science education at oakland county schools in 
pontiac mich 
andersen and motz cited several reasons outdated teaching 
methods and curricula children who often arent exposed to science 
until secondary school when its often too late to hook their 
interest and lack of practical experience that would allow 
students to understand and get excited about science applications 
in the everyday world 
onethird of our science teachers are teaching classes in a 
discipline they werent trained for andersen said we need a 
massive infusion of individually designed programs for teachers 
and for modernizing teaching techniques 
the association has set goals to provide teachers with more 
support develop new curricula and conduct educational research 
motz said 
meanwhile the biggest growth in the associations membership is 
in elementaryschool teachers a good sign because it will help 
fill teaching gaps at that level andersen said 
the association also hopes to help overcome the predictions of 
large numbers of job vacancies by making science more appealing to 
women and minorities he said 
women let boys dominate in science and teachers let them 
dominate andersen said we need more science teachers who know 
how to empower girls so that girls become convinced that science 
really is a field for them

saying he felt like a pawn in a chess 
game oliver north conceded today he lied to congress after his 
boss sent him against his will to a session where he denied 
providing assistance to the contras 
did you tell the truth at that meeting on aug 6 1986 
defense lawyer brendan sullivan asked north during his second day 
of testimony at his criminal trial 
no said north i went into the meeting not believing 
it would be illegal not to tell congress the truth and thats why 
i didnt think the meeting would be a good idea 
the session with the house intelligence committee was in the 
white house situation room 
the former white house aide said thennational security adviser 
john poindexter told him you go to the meeting with them its 
informal 
i felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants 
north said 
north said he had wanted the reagan white house to invoke 
executive privilege against a looming congressional inquiry of 
secret contra aid in 1986 but was brushed aside by poindexter the 
meeting with the house panel succeeded in fending off that inquiry 
you start howling about executive privilege and its just 
going to make it more difficult for everybody north quoted 
poindexter as telling him before the meeting 
north said poindexter was worried that a 100 million contra aid 
package which was about to be approved by congress would be 
imperiled if the administration refused to respond 
invoking executive privilege would have allowed north to refuse 
to respond to questions 
north is accused of obstructing congress by telling the panel he 
didnt give military advice to the contras and didnt raise funds 
for the rebels the charge also accuses him of obstruction by 
denying having had any contact with contra supporter john singlaub 
for the previous 20 months and by denying he advised or guided the 
man who was his courier to the contras robert owen 
north contradicting earlier testimony by poindexters 
predecessor robert mcfarlane also testified that he doctored 
classified memos in november 1986 at mcfarlanes direction 
the national security council memos originally showed what i 
had been doing at his direction in central america for the 
contras the delivery of arms working with general richard v 
secord and building the resistance north told the jury at 
his criminal trial 
testifying for the second day in his own defense north said 
mcfarlane first told him to alter the documents in 1985 in response 
to congressional queries about news accounts that north was 
assisting the contras 
in 1985 mcfarlane handed me a list of half a dozen highly 
sensitive memos north had written his boss detailing involvement 
with the rebels and he said these need to be fixed north 
said 
his testimony directly contradicts mcfarlanes who told the 
jury earlier that north came to him with a few unsolicited changes 
in the memos mcfarlane said he threw them away 
north also is accused of obstructing congress and obstructing a 
presidential inquiry by altering the memos 
north said he balked at making the changes telling mcfarlane 
that there must be 30 documents that are full of similar 
references to assisting the contras during a congressional ban on 
military aid to the rebels 
north said he just told me to fix the documents but that 
north didnt do so in 1985 
why not do what he said asked north lawyer brendan sullivan 
i didnt think it made any sense replied north 
in november 1986 as the irancontra affair was surfacing 
mcfarlane by then out of the nsc returned to help reconstruct an 
account of the iran arms initiative and again asked north about 
the memos north said 
oh by the way did you ever take care of that other stuff 
north said mcfarlane asked him 
i havent taken care of it yet but i will north said he 
replied his former secretary fawn hall testified earlier that on 
instructions from north she altered the documents by deleting 
numerous references to norths direct involvement with the contras 
the alterations were consistent with what he had earlier told 
me to do north testified 
it never occurred to me it was unlawful testified north 
north also testified he tried unsuccessfully to persuade 
mcfarlane to refuse to answer congressional inquiries about the 
reagan administrations secret assistance to the nicaraguan rebels 
north said he told mcfarlane that we should be invoking 
executive privilege after two letters came in from congress in 
august 1985 also among the 12 counts against north are charges 
that he lied to obstructed congress in helping prepare written 
responses which denied that the national security council was 
involved in soliciting funds or offering tactical advice to the 
contras

president bush ordered us military personnel 
today to assist in the cleanup of the huge oil spill off the coast 
of alaska he predicted the effort would be massive prolonged 
and frustrating 
we all share the sorrow and concern of alaskans he said 
exxons efforts standing alone are not enough 
bush announced the decision during an appearance in the white 
house briefing room at which he was accompanied by cabinet members 
and alaskan members of congress 
bush had been under pressure from members of congress and 
alaskan officials to intervene in the oil spill cleanup 
he said he had directed defense secretary dick cheney to make 
available us military forces personnel and equipment to assist in 
the cleanup and transportation secretary samuel skinner to 
coordinate the whole operation 
at the pentagon defense department officials said they had 
postponed a decision on how many servicemen might be sent to alaska 
until a special assessment team determines the best way to apply 
military support to the cleanup operation 
the pentagon said its assessment team consisting of 
engineering environmental medical and logistics specialists 
would depart for valdez today an alaska oil spill joint task force 
was being established headed by lt gen thomas g mcinerney of 
the air force the commanding general of the alaskan air command 
the president insisted that we are not federalizing this 
operation 
this should not relieve exxon from any of its responsibilities 
or liabilities the president said 
the exxon tanker valdez ran aground march 24 spilling 10 
million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound the captain 
of the tanker joseph j hazelwood has been charged in the 
incident 
a lot has been done bush said when asked why it had taken 
the federal government so long to intervene 
asked whether he was satisified with the cleanup efforts thus 
far bush said im not satisfied with anything about it i 
feel very very strongly about the damage to our environment there 
so im not totally satisfied 
bush who made environmental issues a key theme of his 
presidential campaign said the oil spill was an aberration and 
that it should not affect us oil exploration 
i am not going to suggest that because of this that we should 
rethink a policy of trying to get this country less dependent on 
foreign oil the president said 
our ultimate goal must be the complete restoration of the 
ecology and the economy of prince william sound including all of 
its fish marine mammals birds and other wildlife 
he conceded the job will be massive prolonged and 
frustrating nothing we can do will resolve this problem in the 
short term 
throughout his remarks bush reiterated that exxon bears the 
ultimate responsibility for the oil spill in addition to paying 
damage claims against it we urge exxon to increase its local 
hiring for the cleanup effort he said 
bush also said he had directed white house staff to develop 
plans to enable volunteers to participate in cleanup activities 
and that he hoped such a program would be in effect by summer 
i kind of think the president has told the fishermen if they 
want economic relief they should join the army said valdez mayor 
john devens after watching bush on television from his washington 
hotel room he showed a lack of sensitivity as to what has 
happened economically 
even as bush was announcing an increased federal effort senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine was telling colleagues he 
finds it alarming that the administration waited so long 
a federal takeover of the cleanup effort was warranted after 
it became clear on the day of the accident that alyeska the oil 
pipeline service company and exxon had not respond in the manner 
called for by the contingency plan and did not have sufficient 
equipment available to contain the spill mitchell said 
witnesses at congressional hearings thursday testified that 
neither the industry nor the government was prepared for the 
environmental disaster created by the oil spill 
during a senate hearing adm paul yost commandant of the coast 
guard cautioned against federal control 
i am not prepared to federalize this spill yost said 
adding that such a move might leave it open for exxon to close 
their checkbook and force the government to assume cleanup costs 
yost did say that the coast guard was assuming greater direction 
over the exxon corps cleanup efforts such as how it goes about 
the cleanup what equipment it uses and what the cleanup priorities 
are 
lg rawls chairman of exxon corp told the senate panel that 
the petroleum giant will continue doing all we can to clean up 
and mitigate the spills effects 
rawls maintained that the federal government should share some 
of the blame for early delays in the cleanup because authorities 
refused to approve use of a chemical dispersal agent until nearly 
three days after the spill began 
yost defended the decision not to approve use of the chemical 
and said exxon only had a few thousand gallons of the chemical 
he called that amount a drop in the bucket given the size of 
the spill 
but he criticized exxon for moving too slowly in the hours 
immediately after the accident 
a fisherman choking back tears described the disappointment 
the prince william sound community felt toward exxons efforts 
we expected exxon to mobilize and clean up the spill and 
assist the sound communities with recovery efforts said pete 
isleib the truth is that the people of cordova reached into 
their own treasury and began protecting uncontaminated areas of the 
sound while exxon helped its outoftown experts react 
it is not a joke that the inevitable souvenir tshirts were 
deployed before the containment boom was around the exxon valdez

jailed african national 
congress leader nelson mandela says he is deeply troubled by black 
factional fighting and he urged unity among antiapartheid groups 
according to a letter released friday 
i consider it a serious indictment against all of us that we 
are still unable to combine forces to stop the slaughter of so many 
innocent lives said the letter released by mangosuthu 
buthelezi a zulu leader at odds with the anc 
the political struggle is our life and even though the 
realization of our fondest dreams may not be at hand we can 
nevertheless make that struggle immensely enriching or absolutely 
disastrous according to the letter which buthelezi said he 
received from mandela last month 
buthelezi leader of selfgoverning homeland of kwazulu read 
the letter thursday at the kwazulu legislative assembly one of the 
few instances in recent years that mandela has been quoted publicly 
mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiterun 
government there has been widespread speculation that he could be 
released within the next year 
mandela 70 was treated for tuberculosis last year and was 
moved to a suburbanstyle house on the grounds of the victor 
verster prison outside cape town 
the anc wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in its bid to 
undermine south africas government 
buthelezi opposes apartheid the governments policy of racial 
separation but the anc and other militant antiapartheid 
organizations say he is too conservative because he does not 
support sanctions strikes demonstrations and other 
confrontational methods of political resistance 
mandelas letter called for reconciliation between the anc and 
buthelezi who also heads inkatha a 15 millionmember political 
organization 
my fervent hope is to see in due course the restoration of 
the cordial relations which existed between you and or anc 
president oliver r tambo and between the two organizations in 
the 70s mandela wrote to buthelezi 
inkatha has been involved in vicious faction fighting in natal 
province for the past two years with supporters of the banned 
united democratic front which is the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition and a political ally of the anc 
more than 1000 blacks have been killed in the battles around 
the southeastern cities of durban and pietermaritzburg 
in my entire political career few things have distressed me as 
to see our people killing one another as is now happening 
mandela wrote 
the most challenging task facing the black leadership today 
is that of national unity he added at no other time in our 
history has it become so crucial for our people to speak with one 
voice

workers have plastered over the words 
white and colored carved in the courthouse wall over old 
drinking fountains 
i hope this is over so we can move from this to something more 
constructive said ben chaney a laurel resident whose son 
james was slain in neshoba county in 1964 along with two other 
civil rights workers 
jones county naacp chapter president manuel jones asked the 
county supervisors monday night to remove the nonfunctional 
fountains or mask the words permanently the fountains have stood 
on the courthouse lawn in ellisville since 1907 
but the board of supervisors minus its only black member 
jerome wyatt tabled a motion to alter the fountains delaying 
action until board attorney tony thaxton could discuss the issue 
with the state department of archives and history 
the courthouse is a registered mississippi historical landmark 
and alterations to registered buildings must be approved through 
the department by a written permit 
but supervisors then acted without a permit this week and gave a 
county work crew the goahead to cover the engravings 
supervisor thurman dikes said thursday that the supervisors had 
approved the plastering work and he didnt think their attorney was 
aware of the decision 
those fountains were controversial a long time ago wyatt 
said explaining that the state department of archives and history 
had asked for the fountains for the state history museums civil 
rights exhibit about two years ago and the county board agreed 
but people in the area complained about history being removed 
from the county so we left them alone

oil from the exxon valdez threatened a 
national park and oozed through barriers protecting fisheries as 
president bush today ordered us armed forces to assist in the 
cleanup of alaskas prince william sound 
state officials said they welcomed help to move equipment but 
said beach cleanup was futile now they also said they worked out 
an agreement between exxon and the coast guard to transfer more 
management responsibility to the federal agency 
exxon will handle contracts and purchases and the coast guard 
will direct field activity said dennis kelso commissioner of the 
department of environmental conservation 
its a resolution of what we thought was a real logjam 
kelso said 
with the nations worst crude oil spill in its third week exxon 
made a second public apology and the tankers captain made bail on 
charges that he was drunk when his ship went aground 
the good friday spill of 101 million gallons has killed 
thousands of seabirds and otters in the snowy landscape on the 
central alaskan coast fishermen have lost millions of dollars 
and despite cleanup efforts by industry government and private 
citizens the spill has spread to more than 2600 square miles 
its just immense jim hayden who is coordinating the 
cleanup for the state said thursday i dont think a spill of 
this size is controllable 
bush today directed defense secretary dick cheney to make 
available us military forces personnel and equipment to assist in 
the cleanup the president also directed transportation secretary 
samuel skinner to oversee the cleanup effort but he said we are 
not federalizing this operation 
this should not relieve exxon from any of its responsibilities 
or liabilities bush said in the white house briefing room 
accompanied by cabinet members and alaskas congressional 
contingent 
he conceded the job of cleaning up the oil that has washed up 
along the alaskan coast with devastating effect on wildlife will 
be massive prolonged and frustrating nothing we can do will 
resolve this problem in the short term 
kelso said the military was welcome to help move equipment but 
there was no need to line the shore with troops 
we think that deployment of equipment and material that are 
promised are the key elements right now kelso said more 
people will be needed for shoreline cleanup but that is not what 
the proper focus should be right now 
alyeska pipeline service co the consortium of oil companies 
that owns and operates the 800mile transalaska oil pipeline and 
the valdez terminal announced thursday that it would immediately 
begin requiring random drug and alcohol testing aboard all vessels 
using the terminal 
alyeska also said it would require tugboat escorts for all 
entering and departing vessels to a point beyond bligh reef where 
the exxon valdez ran aground 
late thursday the oily sheen was reported lapping at the rocks 
on islands near kenai fjords national park a remote refuge 100 
miles southwest of valdez ron smith a spokesman for a 
federalstate cleanup effort said new booms were being put up to 
protect the area of inlets and fjords 
closer to the spill site local fishermen continued their fight 
to save the salmon fishery at threemilelong sawmill bay using 
fishing nets to corral the oil and super sucker vacuum trucks 
to remove it and protect millions of salmon fry 
rand little product manager for the prince william sound 
aquaculture corp said oil breached one of three booms protecting 
the young salmon fishermen were able to repair the breach before 
damage was done 
but fishermen worried about high tides this weekend that could 
lift the oil over the booms and complained that they couldnt empty 
their oilfilled barges because of a lack of pumps 
the frustration with the slow cleanup wasnt confined to area 
fishermen alaska legislators have introduced several bills 
designed to better prepare the state in the event of future spills 
and rep george miller dcalif said his twoday tour of prince 
william sound convinced him oil industry contingency plans for a 
spill were essentially a fraud on the public 
the industry effort to clean up this spill is almost 
nonexistent said miller head of the congressional subcommittee 
overseeing oil exploration 
exxon chairman lg rawl issued a second apology for the spill 
caused when the tanker exxon valdez struck a reef outside the 
normal shipping channel but said the companys response to the 
accident was immediate and thorough 
on the east coast the captain of the tanker that spread the 
oily disaster was free after his bail was reduced to 25000 from 
1 million the judge said the former skipper joseph hazelwood of 
huntington ny was unlikely to flee 
hazelwood 42 faces charges in alaska of operating a ship while 
drunk reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil an 
extradition request from alaska is pending the misdemeanors carry 
a maximum penalty of 2 years in prison and a 10000 fine upon 
conviction 
hazelwood had turned over control of the tanker to a third mate 
who was not certified to pilot the boat in the sound

hiring permanent parttime workers and 
contracting out some services may have to be considered as ways to 
save money in postal operations postmaster general anthony frank 
told a senate subcommittee friday 
rising health care costs and other expenses are eating up 
savings realized through automation and the massive postal agency 
needs to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs 
frank told the subcommittee on federal services post office and 
civil service 
so far this year while we still anticipate that revenues will 
exceed expenses by a small margin we have not done as well as we 
had planned frank reported 
the postal service had planned for a surplus this year based on 
the 25cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago 
frank has said previously that he expected the agency to drop 
into the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991 
maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs every 
three years 
when postal managers applied for the current rates they were 
overly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the 
round figure of a quarter frank told the subcommittee 
in the real world costs have exceeded those expectations 
resulting in a smaller surplus than had been hoped for also 
affecting the postal budget was legislation last year requiring the 
agency to contribute funds toward reducing the federal debt 
frank told the subcommittee that in order to maintain universal 
postal service and to save money without affecting the current 
postal employees his managers are having to reevaluate all 
operations of the agency 
maybe we need to look at permanent parttime people he 
commented noting that such workers are common in other countries 
the netherlands for example hires many housewives to deliver mail 
four hours per day frank said 
another possibility is contracting out some work the postal 
service currently uses contractors to handle about 15 percent of 
its rural routes and may need to expand that share and consider 
hiring contractors for other tasks frank said 
use of bar codes on all letters by 1995 and other improvements 
in automation will help speed the mail and save money but those 
are longterm benefits and not things that will affect the agency 
overnight he said 
in addition automation requires a considerable investment 
frank said for example several years ago managers bought machines 
designed to read the ninedigit zip codes those codes were delayed 
by congress and never become popular with the public so the 
machines are now being converted to perform other tasks

civilian unemployment fell to 50 percent last 
month the lowest rate in more than 15 years even as the pace of 
job growth slowed the government said friday 
the report painted a picture of a moderating economy influenced 
heavily by a tight labor market nonfarm payroll jobs rose by 
180000 down 100000 from february 
another indication of moderation the average manufacturing work 
week fell from 411 hours to february to 409 hours last month 
amid the signs of moderation however were indications of 
increasing inflationary pressures on the economy 
average hourly earnings rose at a 50 percent annual rate 
construction jobs fell sharply the drop was blamed on rising 
interest rates 
a record 63 percent of the workingage population had jobs but 
analysts took that as a sign of possible labor shortages down the 
road some 1171 million americans had jobs in march just 61 
million were out of work but looking 
the march unemployment rate was down from 51 percent in 
february and was the lowest since 49 percent in december 1973 
some economists saw in fridays labor department report signs of 
the stagflation that cripped the economy as the decade began 
slow economic growth in the face of moderate inflation 
om 45 
percent in february to 46 percent in march among all adult men

direct way of making his point he packed his exxon credit cards in 
an oilfilled plastic bag thursday and mailed them to the company 
rudloe an author and environmental activist from panacea fla 
said he hoped others would join his protest 
it makes a very interesting package to see this exxon card 
swilling around in black oil and i think it gets the point 
across he said they say a picture is worth a thousand words 
and this beats all the rhethoric 
the protests come two weeks after the tanker exxon valdez ran 
aground in alaskas prince william sound disgorging 101 million 
gallons of crude oil alaska officials who are angry with exxons 
handling of the cleanup said thursday that less than 4 percent of 
the oil has been recovered 
exxon chairman lg rawl in a statement to a congressional 
committee thursday again apologized on behalf of his company for 
the spill but said exxons response was immediate and thorough 
in erie pa mary machuga 34 said she and her husband mike 
38 began campaigning for a boycott this week out of frustration 
and have been getting messages of support 
we have not been real activists but we finally decided its 
time to do something she said and luckily people from all 
over the country have felt the same way 
meotti said he is working with connecticut environmental groups 
to spread word of the oneday boycott he said the economic impact 
on exxon may be small but the gesture will send a clear message

a longawaited draft law reforming soviet 
practices on religion removes a stalinera prohibition on group 
religious education and opens limited alternatives to bearing arms 
in military service 
new legislation that has been in the works for at least 18 
months will reeplace a directive put into force 60 years ago at the 
height of the soviet unions antireligious fervor and for the 
first time give churches legal standing to fight official abuse an 
official said friday 
the associated press obtained a copy of the asyet uncompleted 
draft legislation from religious dissidents tatyana 
belokovylskaya chief of legal affairs for the governments council 
on religious affairs said it was an authentic document that had 
been presented to church authorities for discussion 
this is a big step forward in the democratization of relations 
between the church and state she said 
believers have been persecuted for years despite laws that 
guarantee freedom of worship but ms belokovylskaya said the new 
legislation will give them a chance to fight back 
in order to protect themselves religious organizations have 
to have legal standing they are not only presented with rights 
but the ability to protect themselves she said 
but dissidents say it doesnt go far enough to protect them from 
persecution or to separate the government from the communist 
partys official atheism dissidents also have said they lack faith 
in church leaders who have cooperated with the government 
officials are completing work on the document a year after 
president mikhail s gorbachev met patriarch pimen head of the 
russian orthodox church that meeting the first of its kind in 40 
years symbolized gorbachevs effort to ease restrictions on 
believers and draw them into his reform process 
as a sign of authorities more liberal attitude toward religion 
the moscow news reported that 1610 new groups of believers were 
registered in 1988 compared with 104 in the previous year it said 
authorities handed back 937 religious buildings that had been taken 
away and granted permission for 143 new churches and mosques to be 
built 
when finished the draft law will be presented to the soviet 
unions new congress of peoples deputies parliament 
ms belokovylskaya said changes are still being made in the law 
but several key points have been decided they include provisions 
allowing for alternatives to bearing arms group religious 
education and establishing the legal standing of churches in 
addition ms belokovylskaya said a more recent draft of the law 
permits religious organizations to engage in charitable work 
under the stalinera directive that still serves as the model 
for laws in each of the 15 soviet republics believers may not 
organize any charitable activity or church groups they face 
prosecution for obtaining group religious training for themselves 
or their children 
young men who refuse compulsory military service face terms in 
prison camps all religious groups must be registered with the 
government and only can be approved if they consist of 20 or more 
adults 
citizens may teach and learn religion in a private manner as 
an individual as well as together with others including at home 
and through a religious society the draft law said 
ms belokovylskaya said that absolutely allowed for the 
group religious training of children 
religious organizations also will be allowed to use the official 
media she said 
ms belokovylskaya said alternative service permitted by courts 
on an individual basis was a controversial point but all the 
same we are reducing the size of our military this idea has its 
time and place 
types of alternative service have not yet been established but 
may be based on the experience of countries such as hungary and 
east germany that provide for work in military hospitals or 
construction where believers would not be required to take up arms 
she said 
ms belokovylskaya said officials still are considering ways to 
provide the legal protection afforded by official registration 
while meeting the demands by some evangelical christians that they 
not be required to register 
dissidents who have rejected the proposed reforms as 
insufficient wrote their own law at a threeday conference in 
moscow at the end of march 
former political prisoner alexander ogorodnikov complained the 
draft law provides more freedom but leaves final decisions in the 
hands of soviet administrators we know what kind of 
administration that is he said 
dissidents also included a section of law separating the 
government and schools not only from religion but from atheism as 
well 
believers long have complained the soviet unions official 
atheism established in the constitution as a right to conduct 
atheist propaganda begins with training as early as 
kindergarten

marlee matlin who won an oscar in 1986 
for her performance in children of a lesser god says speaking 
at last years academy awards signaled a dramatic change in her 
career 
the deaf actress 23 said she had been afraid to pursue roles 
that required her to speak until she decided to present the 
nominees for best actor last year by talking instead of using sign 
language 
her action was criticized by some hearing impaired 
organizations who argued that she gave the impression that every 
deaf person could speak 
i felt sad for those individuals who did not or would not 
respect me for what i did but i decided im not going to let other 
people change me matlin said in fridays editions of the 
nashville banner 
matlins newest film bridge to silence was an added 
challenge said the actress who has been deaf since the age of 19 
months 
it was a great deal different because ive never acted and 
spoke at the same time she said and i would do it again and 
again and again if i was offered the opportunity

a destructive earthquake seems almost certain 
to strike the eastern united states sometime in the next two 
decades a senate subcommittee was told friday 
while scientists cannot predict when or where the quake might 
hit or its strength they consider one almost sure to occur before 
the year 2010 according to robert l ketter director of the 
national center for earthquake engineering research 
both ketter and sen alan cranston dcalif cited the armenian 
quake in december as raising attention to similar dangers in the 
united states 
quakes in the eastern part of the united states have received 
less attention than those in the west because the strongest eastern 
tremors came before the nation was heavily developed and thus led 
to few losses of lives 
ketter told the subcommittee that while the likelihood of a 
quake in any particular place is low the probability of one 
occurring somewhere in the eastern united states before the year 
2000 can be considered better than 75 percent to 95 percent before 
the year 2010 nearly 100 percent 
the potential for quakes in armenia was also well known yet 
lack of preparation left thousands dead and massive damage 
cranston told the senate subcommittee on science technology and 
space 
the hazard in many parts of the us is no less certain than 
it was in armenia said cranston citing quakes that have caused 
death and major damage in california idaho kentucky alaska and 
other states 
the challenge that faces us now is to use our new capability 
and capacity for earthquake hazards reduction before we have to 
face the public and explain our inaction as the soviets now 
must cranston said 
the senators comments came in support of a bill to strengthen 
the national earthquake hazards program including a transfer of 
that activity to the us geological survey currently the 
earthquake program is part of the federal emergency management 
agency 
cranston noted that earthquakes once thought of as primarily a 
california and alaska problem are now known to be a major danger 
to many states 
perhaps the most powerful quake ever to strike the united states 
occurred in a series of tremors in 18111812 that rocked the new 
madrid mo region ketter testified 
in addition severe quakes in the 18th century and 19th century 
struck charleston sc boston under the ocean near new york 
city and in the charlevoix region of quebec ketter told the 
subcommittee 
compounding the problem is the fact that in the eastern states 
underlying rocks are older and more dense thus reported ketter 
earthquakes in the east can cause damage over a much larger area 
than in the west 
one of the 1811 quakes in missouri for example had a strength 
similar to the 1906 san francisco quake the temblor in missouri 
however affected an area 15 times larger than the california quake 
lacy e suiter chairman of the central us earthquake 
consotrium testified that there is a 40 percent to 63 percent 
chance of a strong quake occurring in the ned madrid mo region 
by the turn of the century 
ketter said that if the 18111812 missouri quakes were to occur 
today the death toll could approach 5000 people with massive 
destruction in such communities as memphis tenn paducah ky 
carbondale ill evansville ind poplar bluff mo and little 
rock ark

those questions about george bushs role in 
the irancontra affair just wont go away they dogged him during 
the presidential campaign and they hit him again friday but bush 
is standing fast refusing to offer any new details 
please accept it when i said i dont want to talk about it 
any more said the president when reporters raised the issue anew 
during a briefing on the alaska oil spill 
look were having a briefing on alaska he said sounding a 
bit testy over the attempt to get him to talk about an 
extraordinary document entered into evidence at the trial of oliver 
north 
the document outlined the workings of the secret effort to keep 
supplies flowing to the nicaraguan contras despite a congressional 
ban on aid it began with the statement that the united states 
has admitted for purposes of this trial the following facts to be 
true 
the account suggested that bush then vice president had a more 
active role in that supply effort than has been publicly disclosed 
it said bush met with the president of honduras in may 1985 to 
inform him of president reagans decision to speed up delivery of 
us military aid to that country former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane has testified that reagan personally approved the 
secret deal to slip extra aid to honduras as one of several quid 
pro quo arrangements with other countries in exchange for support 
for the contras 
the document linked the us aid to honduran cooperation in 
assisting the contras but it did not say whether bush was aware of 
that condition 
exactly what bush was aware of in those conspiratorial days in 
the white house basement has never been clear 
bush has denied having any knowledge of a diversion of iran 
armssales proceeds to the contras although he admitted knowing 
about the clandestine arms sales to iran and said he supported the 
initiative with certain reservations donald gregg his national 
security adviser during the period in question said he did not 
tell bush about the contra resupply effort that gregg had learned 
about from a onetime cia associate 
former secretary of state alexander m haig jr pressed bush 
repeatedly during the campaign for the 1988 gop presidential 
nomination to say more about his role in the effort to help the 
contras 
if you cant answer your friends said haig during a 
republican candidate debate what in heavens name is going to 
happen next november if you are our standardbearer and these 
democrats get after you on this subject 
candidate bush liked to cite his experience as reagans no 2 
ive been copilot for seven years he said 
were you in the cockpit or were you on an economy ride in the 
back of the plane retorted haig 
republican rival bob dole was equally determined but no more 
successful 
would he release some of the documents pertaining to his role 
bush was asked by his republican rivals 
i think some of those are classified he said 
asked whether he would allow them to be declassified the vice 
president replied im perfectly willing 
on one point bush was absolutely correct he said no republican 
would beat him by making an issue of irancontra 
no democrat would either hard as they would try 
where was george democrats chanted at their convention when 
sen edward m kennedy used that refrain to question what role bush 
had in irancontra as well as other policy issues during his term 
as vice president 
safely elected and inaugurated and now happily in residence at 
1600 pennsylvania avenue bush still cant seem to kick those 
irancontra questions 
no longer no 2 he appeared in the white house briefing room to 
talk about the alaskan oil spill 
he outlined steps he was taking to assist the cleanup and then 
invited questions 
fire away he said 
how do you reconcile your efforts to arrange thirdcountry 
military aid for the contras with the spirit of the ban by congress 
on aid to the rebels was the first question 
im not going to comment on any aspect of the north trial 
responded the president in measured tones 
he expressed concern about prejudicing the trial of the former 
white house aide and said the information had already been examined 
by the special prosecutor and congressional committees that 
investigated the case 
all the material that you seem to be referring to has been 
available to the independent counsel and the irancontra committee 
and has been reviewed by them for any special significance 
but it remains largely unavailable to the public and was never 
available either to bushs campaign rivals or to the voters in 1988

lord has sued the detroit news claiming the newspaper defamed her 
judge consuelo sanchezduran and her husband augusto sanabria 
seek at least 10000 in the lawsuit filed thursday in wayne 
county circuit court 
the lawsuit claims a feb 12 story defamed the couple and 
endangered their lives 
the story said sanchezduran left colombia after her life was 
threatened for ordering the arrest of pablo escobar head of 
colombias largest cocaine ring it also said the judge had 24hour 
guards paid by the us government 
escobar hasnt been arrested and is believed to be in colombia 
he also has been indicted in the united states 
the story quoted a highly placed source as saying a team of 
15 elite police officers had been assigned to protect the judge it 
also said tenants of the apartment building in which she lives are 
concerned over her presence 
sanchezduran claimed the story was unnecessary and dangerous 
recklessly placing the couple and the general public in a 
position of harm 
the lawsuit names columnist pete waldmeir and news executive 
editor robert h giles a woman who answered the telephone in 
giles office friday said the newspaper hasnt been served notice 
of the lawsuit 
at the time the story was published giles said the news 
believed it did the right thing 
you balance whatever the presumed risk to the judge against 
whether the community needs to know about this and there was 
no question to run the story he said 
the newspaper printed the name of the apartment complex where 
she was living we recognized that many of the people in the 
current detroit location already knew she was there giles said

the khmer rouge which governed 
cambodia by famine and massacre before the vietnamese invaded a 
decade ago urged on friday that the united nations supervise 
vietnams troop withdrawal 
it also demanded the hanoisponsored government of cambodia be 
replaced by a coalition including the three resistance factions of 
which the khmer rouge is the most powerful 
fear of the khmer rouge regaining power has been at the heart of 
negotiations for a settlement 
france accepted a request from prince norodom sihanouk once 
cambodias ruler and now leader of the resistance alliance that it 
hold an international conference on the future of cambodia 
sihanouk also has recommended un supervision of the withdrawal 
vietnam said wednesday would pull out of cambodia by sept 30 
after nearly 11 years of occupation and urged that china and other 
countries stop aiding the resitance 
the occupation blocks diplomatic relations with the united 
states from which hanoi hopes to get aid and hinders trade 
relations with noncommunist neighbors china has linked withdrawal 
to resumption of normal relations with the soviet union vietnams 
ally 
a statement wednesday by vietnam laos and the cambodian 
government of premier hun sen proposed that india poland and 
canada monitor departure it rejected demands that the hun sen 
administration be dissolved 
in its first statement on the vietnamese plan the khmer rouge 
said through its clandestine radio that the entire cambodian 
people absolutely cannot accept the announcement of a unilateral 
troop pullout of the hanoi vietnamese aggressors 
vietnamese soldiers entered cambodia in december 1978 and ousted 
the khmer rouge under whose rule of less than four years an 
estimated onefourth of cambodias 8 million people were executed 
or died of hunger 
western intelligence sources estimate khmer rouge strength at 
20000 to 40000 fighters far more than the khmer peoples 
national liberation front and forces led by sihanouk 
hanoi has withdrawn about half its troops from cambodia and says 
50000 remain western analysts put the number at about 70000 
the khmer rouge broadcast in a statement attributed to its 
leader khieu samphan accused hanoi of trying to avoid un 
supervision so it can keep soldiers in cambodia secretly it also 
proposed the coalition of hun sens government and the resistance 
groups 
resistance leaders oppose poland as a monitor because of its 
ties to the soviet union and india has recognized the hun sen 
government 
without genuine supervision by the united nations there would 
be no genuine withdrawal of vietnamese troops the khmer rouge 
radio said 
vietnam and its client government in phnom penh oppose un 
supervision because sihanouks coalition has been given the 
cambodian seat in the general assembly 
foreign minister roland dumas said in paris that france was 
willing to sponsor an international conference on cambodia after 
another round of talks by the cambodian factions two meetings have 
been held jakarta indonesia without substantial results 
sihanouk said thursday the conference should include vietnam 
the cambodian factions the six member nations of the noncommunist 
association of southeast asian nations and the five permanent 
members of the un security council the united states soviet 
union china britain and france

president bush repeatedly refused on friday to 
talk about a written government admission that he took part in the 
reagan administrations secret contra aid operation saying he 
wanted to avoid endangering the trial of oliver north 
bush rebuffed reporters questions saying any comment from him 
could prejudice the federal trial of north the former white house 
aide who is accused of lying and obstructing congress about his 
efforts to assist the nicaraguan rebels 
i am not going to comment on any aspect of the north trial

questionandanswer session if i even comment on your question 
it could prejudice the trial 
he declared the legal process ought to run unfettered without 
you or me endangering the trial process and thats the last 
question i will take on that subject 
bush deflected two later attempts to get his response to a 
lengthy statement introduced at norths trial on thursday parts of 
the statement disclosed that bush while vice president saw 
several north memoranda involving the secret us effort to aid the 
contras 
the court summary of facts introduced by norths attorneys and 
agreed to by the government also stated that bush met in 1985 with 
thenpresident roberto suazo of honduras to tell him us aid to 
his country was being expedited 
at the time the administration was engaged in efforts to ensure 
honduras continued its key role in supporting the contras while 
congress had forbidden us aid to the rebels fighting the 
government of nicaragua 
the expedited aid to honduras was part of a secret agreement 
calling for that nation in return to help the contras according 
to the court summary 
there was no indication that bush mentioned this linkage when he 
met with suazo 
bush said friday it would be imprudent for him to discuss the 
matter he also said however that the material from the court 
document has been available to the independent counsel and the 
irancontra committees and reviewed by them for any special 
significance 
ive said all i want to say about it because i really believe 
on the advice of lawyers that thats the last thing we ought to do 
is even be kicking it around he said his voice rising so 
please accept it when i said i dont want to talk about it any more 
and im not going to 
bush has denied knowing at the time about any diversion of iran 
armssales proceeds to the contras although he has acknowledged 
knowing about the clandestine arms sales to iran he has said he 
was not familiar with details of the contra supply effort 
in a speech just over a week after the irancontra affair became 
public at the end of 1986 bush said he had supported the iran arms 
sales but i was not aware of and oppose any diversion of 
funds any ransom payments or any circumvention of the will of the 
congress 
meanwhile on friday house speaker jim wright said bushs role 
in covert support for the contras shouldnt damage evolving 
bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy between congress and the 
white house 
were not going to permit anything that happened in the past 
to interfere with what happens in the future wright dtexas 
told reporters following a speech in which he extolled 
bipartisanship in us policy toward central america 
that does not imply approval or sanction of bushs past 
role as disclosed in the north trial statement wright said 
the court document is preceded by a heading stating the 
united states has admitted for purposes of this trial the following 
facts to be true 
it shows that bush met with suazo at a time when the hondurans 
had shown reluctance to continue helping the contras 
the reagan administration in part through special offers of 
assistance was trying to enlist honduras and nicaraguas three 
other central american neighbors to give the contras weapons 
facilitate armament deliveries and allow use of their lands to be 
used for such crucial contra needs as aircraft landing zones 
in early march 1985 bush asked national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane whether bush should encourage a private group to donate 
a planeload of medical supplies that would arrive in honduras 
coincident with bushs meeting with suazo 
bush strongly favored such a flight the document said 
noting that the unidentified group was supportive of the 
resistance it said north told mcfarlane that bushs idea was 
sound the document did not reveal whether the planeload of 
supplies actually arrived

a businessman charged in the pentagon 
corruption scandal acknowledged friday that a private consultant 
his firm had hired for 150000 did nothing in return for the 
initial installments on the contract 
dale schnittjer a former vice president of teledyne electronics 
of newbury park calif made the admission under crossexamination 
in us district court as the defense wound up its case 
schnittjer and two other former teledyne executives george kaub 
and eugene sullivan are charged with bribery conspiracy and wire 
fraud in the first trial stemming from the federal governments 
ill wind investigation in which authorities are looking into 
fraud and kickbacks at the pentagon 
us district judge richard williams dismissed the jury at 
midday instructing them to return monday to hear closing 
arguments before the deliberations begin the trial began monday 
schnittjer the final defendant to take the stand said he never 
knew that william parkin a private consultant teledyne electronics 
had hired in october 1985 had paid bribes to a navy engineer for 
confidential information about a 24 million contract for handheld 
radar equipment sullivan and kaub also said they were kept in the 
dark about parkins activities 
parkin and stuart berlin the engineer are among those who 
pleaded guilty in the case before the trial began they testified 
for the government 
schnittjer who joined teledyne electronics in the summer of 
1987 around the time the company was awarded the radar contract 
said parkins deal with teledyne called for him to receive 10000 
in upfront month 
if teledyne won the contract the company agreed to sign a 
subcontract with parkin for 150000 we was supposed to work 
for the subcontract schnittjer said 
under questioning by assistant us attorney jack hanley 
however schnittjer acknowledged that parkin did not produce any 
work in exchange for the roughly 18000 he received in early 1988 
schnittjer said however that teledyne officials had discussed 
having parkin complete a report on avionics 
parkins payments were stopped after the governments 
investigation was made public in june 1988 
parkins contract was terminated when we learned that parkin 
didnt appear to be what he was schnittjer said 
in a related matter joseph e hill 76 of mineola ny was 
sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and fined 20000 
for making illegal campaign contributions to congressional 
campaigns hill a private consultant pleaded guilty to the four

gen wojciech jaruzelski the polish 
leader who banned solidarity in 1981 voted with other parliament 
members friday to lift the legal barriers on the trade union 
the parliament also voted to institute a strong presidency and 
create the east blocs first democratically elected parliament 
chamber part of the economic and trade union reforms sealed 
wednesday following six weeks of talks between the solidarityled 
opposition and communist authorities 
solidarity immediately announced it intended to back candidates 
in the elections planned for june and called for broad social 
activity to elect independent representatives 
historic a turning point said jaruzelski who likely will 
become president in referring to the changes enacted friday but 
he also told state tv there must be determined realization then 
those words will be fully confirmed 
the sejm or parliament lifted the last legal barriers to 
solidarity meaning the union can go to court as early as next week 
to register itself it marks the end of the period of repression 
that began with the dec 13 1981 imposition of martial law 
sejm deputies passed six bills putting into law an agreement on 
political economic and trade union reforms sealed wednesday 
between the solidarityled opposition and communist authorities 
the sejm deferred action on another legislative motion in the 
spirit of reform parliament member ryszard bender called for 
changing the countrys name from the the polish peoples 
republic to the simpler preworld war ii version the republic 
of poland 
lawmakers however overwhelmingly enacted constitutional 
changes creating a democratically chosen senate and the post of 
president 
they also approved the trade union law that permits solidarity 
by a vote of 3394 with 43 abstentions the number of abstentions 
reflecting lingering hesitancy of some party members to reinstate 
the union 
also passed overwhelmingly were laws on elections to the sejm 
elections to the new senate the right to form associations and 
legalizing farmers unions enabling the reemergence of rural 
solidarity rural solidarity was banned along with solidarity after 
the 1981 crackdown 
jaruzelski sitting in a section above most of the deputies 
raised his hand perfunctorily to vote yes 
there was little suspense in the proceedings since the communist 
party has a strong grip on the sejm and already had agreed to the 
legislation 
the only surprise was benders suggestion the countrys name be 
changed back to the republic of poland dropping the adjective 
peoples 
the nation will not agree any longer with the strangesounding 
name of the state imposed during the period of bierutstalinist 
distortions bender said referring to the nowdiscredited 
boleslaw bierut a loyal stalinist who led poland from 1947 until 
his death in 1956 
bender later agreed to allow his motion to be referred to a 
special commission considering a new constitution 
solidaritys statement on elections came at the end of a meeting 
of the unions national executive commission that took place 
without union leader lech walesa 
it is a priority task to take advantage the new possibilities 
even though these elections will not yet be fully democratic the 
union said 
it called on union members and the unions underground press to 
cooperate in the election of independent candidates at all levels 
and to work with other organizations like rural solidarity and the 
independent students association 
it said that the advisory citizens committee formed by walesa 
last year would take the main role in forming lists of independent 
candidates which would be fully backed by solidarity and walesa 
jaruzelskis vote to lift the ban on solidarity concluded his 
dramatic change of course in the past eight years although he 
ordered solidarity banned in 1981 jaruzelski threatened to quit as 
party leader in january if it did not restore the union 
the general argued that legalization will culminate his policy 
of national reconciliation and allow all those who feel responsible 
for polands future to cooperate in rebuilding its shattered 
economy 
in the field of constitutional and electoral changes the bills 
define elections in june that will be the freest ever held in the 
communist country 
the 460 sejm seats will be divided into two groups for 299 of 
the seats or 65 percent people will be able to vote for members 
of the communist party and its allies with the party itself taking 
less than 50 percent and technically becoming a minority party 
thirtyfive percent of the seats or 161 will be reserved for 
independent nonparty candidates 
it was agreed the arrangement would be onetime only and the 
subsequent sejm elections would be either totally or much more 
democratic 
the new fully democratic senate will have 100 members for the 
first time communist candidates must face direct competition from 
anticommunist candidates 
there will be no prescreening of candidates to the senate 
anyone who collects 3000 signatures can run for one of two seats 
from each of the 49 provinces with one extra seat apiece for the 
cities of warsaw and katowice 
the senate will be able to veto legislation of the sejm and the 
sejm must muster a twothirds majority to override the veto 
the sejm and senate will form a national assembly that will 
select the president a new post who will have executive and veto 
powers and can dissolve parliament during a constitutional crisis 
the job seems to be designed for jaruzelski as a guarantee poland 
will stay in the communist bloc

a coalition of conservation groups friday 
urged president bush to withdraw his nomination of james cason to 
oversee the forest service saying cason has shown a wanton 
insensitivity toward the environment 
the groups said that cason as an acting assistant secretary at 
the interior department had improperly applied pressure on the 
us fish and wildlife service to keep the spotted owl off the 
endangered species list and ordered the destruction of a bureau of 
land management draft report that said the owl was threatened by 
logging in the ancient forests of the northwest 
the groups also said that cason 
auuthorized the publication of the socalled mining in the 
parks rule which would have weakend existing regulations 
covering strip mining in national parks and wilderness areas 
attempted to stop the forest service from carrying out a 
congressional mandate to publish regulations governing oil and gas 
leases in national forests 
was responsible for mismanaging an office of surface mining 
permit system that resulted in the waste of millions of taxpayer 
dollars 
bush has nominated cason as an assistant secretary of 
agriculture with authority over the forest service and the soil and 
conservation service the nomination needs senate approval for 
cason to take office 
in a letter to bush the environmental groups said that because 
of casons lack of appreciation for the stewardship 
responsibilities entrusted to public officials who preside over 
public lands and resources and his wanton insensitivity to the 
environmental values which he has been obligated to protect he is 
unsuited for the post of assistant secretary 
the letter said cason has a proven record of antagonism 
toward the environment and an extreme bias in favor of those 
who financially benefit from the exploitation of the nations 
public lands and resources 
among those signing the letter were the national wildlife 
federation the wilderness society the sierra club the national 
parks and conservation association the izzak walton league the 
national audubon society defenders of wildlife and the mineral 
policy center 
cason through an agriculture department spokeswoman has 
categorically denied that he exerted pressure on the fish and 
wildlife service not to list the spotted owl as endangered he has 
also declined interviews until after his confirmation hearing 
before the senate agriculture committee

officials overwhelmed by the numbers of 
people picked up drunk each year in this city bordering the 
nations largest indian tribe urged congress to choose gallup for a 
pilot program to fight alcohol abuse 
mayor edward munoz told a field hearing of the house committee 
on interior and insular affairs that alcoholism is such an 
overwhelming problem that its beyond the resources of the local 
community officials are hoping to get money to be able to treat 
alcoholics rather than just have them put in a police department 
drunk tank 
munoz who was reelected last week following a campaign that 
focused in part on the alcoholism problem called for cooperation 
between the city state and federal governments and the navajo and 
zuni tribes 
in the past he said efforts by gallup to interest other 
governments in the fighting the problem has been met by 
occasional rhetoric but seldom action 
the city of 22000 people is a major trade center for the 
adjacent navajo nation and its population swells to double or even 
triple daily since alcohol is prohibited on the reservations any 
drinking is done in gallup 
the navajo nation with 200000 members is the largest indian 
tribe in the nation about 165000 of its members live on the 
125000squaremile reservation that spans portions of utah 
arizona and new mexico the smaller zuni pueblo also near gallup 
has a tribal membership of about 9000 
city figures show 26222 incidents of protective custody where 
drunks are put in a drunk tank by police while they sober up in 
1988 and more than 30000 in 1987 a consultant estimated the 1987 
figure represented 5000 to 7000 people each picked up an average 
of four or more times 
officials did not have a breakdown on how many of those taken 
into protective custody are indians but said it was a significant 
fraction the city wants to replace protective custody with a 
detoxification and treatment center 
munoz told the hearing the city could commit 25 million in 
bonds toward building a center and some city money toward its 
operation but would need state and federal assistance to handle 
the estimated 42 million annual cost of running the center 
the history of this issue is one of fingerpointing and 
buckpassing the mayor said he urged the congressmen at the 
hearing to move quickly 
gallup police chief frank gonzales agreed that protective 
custody has become a revolving door and said detoxification was the 
only way to break the cycle but beyond treatment he said the 
city has to have jobs and continued care for recovering alcoholics 
as long as we keep protective custody were not going to 
solve the problem he said were going to keep losing lives 
families are going to keep breaking up 
the hearing marks the second time in recent weeks that congress 
has turned its attention to alcoholism in gallup last month new 
mexicos senators pete domenici and jeff bingaman held an 
informal factfinding meeting in the community 
rep bill richardson of new mexico chairman of fridays 
hearing said the new mexico congressional delegation would be 
acting together in working on the issue

the campaign to recover oil from the 
ruptured exxon valdez along the alaskan coast likely will be the 
costliest ever an industry expert said friday 
from airdropped dispersants to the crew members painstakingly 
raking up debris along the shoreline cleanup operations are 
invariably costly and this one will involve thousands of people and 
many months said richard golob publisher of golobs oil pollution 
bulletin 
cleanup costs vary depending on the degree of difficulty but 
golob said the arco anchorage grounding in 1985 off the washington 
coast cost 9 million to clean up and the exxon valdez incident 
spilled about 40 times more oil than that accident he said the 
amoco cadiz spill off france in 1978 cost 110 million to clean 
the average recovery effort costs from 12 to 25 a gallon 
golob said but he said the cost of removing the 101 million 
gallons from alaskas prince william sound will soar particularly 
high because it involves a partially water that is inaccessible 
from land 
so far the crude oil has floated over an estimated 3000 square 
miles killing birds and sea otters and it threatens a national 
park 
initial efforts to use dispersant chemicals to break up the 
slick and mechanical sweepers to recover floating oil were 
expensive and ineffective now golob said the focus has shifted 
to an even costlier laborintensive longterm effort to clean up 
the rugged coastal area 
workers participating in the shoreline operation will have to 
be transported each day long distances and much of the work will 
most likely have to be staged from boats anchored off the 
shoreline golob said 
golob said the cost also was likely to be high because local and 
state officials in alaska will push for a thorough job 
a key question in any cleanup is how clean is clean he 
said 
in an industrial harbor its going to be at a lower level 
than in a pristine area such as prince william sound golob said 
the government and public in that region will push for a return 
the area to its oncepristine condition 
the spill also will bring expenses beyond those of the 
chemicals equipment and labor he said 
its still difficult to assess the total amount of damage in 
terms of economic resources such as commercial fisheries and 
natural resources such as sea otters and water fowl he said 
but theres no doubt it will be longterm and extensive 
he said exxon also should be prepared for courtaward damages 
he noted a federal judges 1152 million recommendation in 
february against amoco corp for the damage from the 1978 amoco 
cadiz supertanker wreck off the coast of france 
its very difficult to put a dollar value on the loss of a 
bird he said but damage suits have already been filed on 
behalf of the fishermen who stand to lose a lot

house speaker jim wright asked a former aide 
to help him out by signing a sworn statement that the aide 
volunteered to work on wrights book and had done so after working 
hours according to testimony to the ethics committee studying the 
speakers finances 
the aides account disputed friday by a wright spokesman is 
the latest revelation to emerge from the probe of alleged 
improprieties by wright that has tarnished his reputation and 
threatened his leadership of the chamber 
sources familiar with the deposition of the former aide matthew 
cossolotto said he told the committee that wright also asked 
aides at a morning staff meeting early in 1985 to help think of 
ways to sell the book reflections of a public man 
mark johnson wrights spokesman dismissed cossolottos account 
as that of a disgruntled former employee 
the committee which began investigating wright last june has 
narrowed its focus to charges that wright used bulk sales of the 
book to circumvent house limits on outside income from speaking and 
writing fees and charges that he improperly accepted gifts 
from a fort worth business partner who had an interest in 
legislation before congress according to sources familiar with the 
probe 
the committee wrapped up its second week of deliberations friday 
and expected to reach some conclusions in the case next week but 
there were indications the panels work might be far from over 
chairman julian dixon dcalif said the panel was seeking to 
extend the contract of its special outside investigator chicago 
attorney richard phelan to july 1 that would allow the panel 
should it decide to seek disciplinary action against wright to 
retain its counsel during the period the rules allow for defense 
motions and committee action on them 
but both dixon and the panels senior republican rep john t 
myers of indiana cautioned reporters dont read anything into 
the extension of the contract 
the two senior panel members also strongly suggested for the 
first time that the panel will publicly release phelans full 
456page report regardless of the outcome of the case dixon said 
committee precedent is for such reports by outside counsel to be 
released in their entirety 
the committee is bound by some precedent dixon said the 
precedent as i see it is that when weve hired outside counsel 
all material related to the specific respondent has been released 
that position put dixon at odds with that of members of the 
house democratic leadership who have argued the panel should 
release only those parts of the report which support its 
conclusions 
in his deposition to the ethics panel last year cossolotto said 
he had telephoned wright last june on the day that a washington 
post story detailed his role in compiling and editing the book 
including a threeweek trip to fort worth to oversee its 
preparation for printing 
he did not at first reach the speaker but wright later called 
him back he told the panel the speaker wanted him to say some 
things that would help him out and suggested that cossolotto 
draft a statement saying he had volunteered to work on the book 
after regular office hours he told the committee cossolotto said 
he declined to make such a statement because he believed the book 
assignment to be part of his official duties 
house rules state that taxpayers money may not be used to pay 
lawmakers employees to do nonofficial or personal tasks but the 
definition of what constitutes such tasks is left vague sources 
have said the ethics panel is not focusing on that issue but rather 
the bulk sales of the book and wrights other business dealings 
cossolotto also said wright had directed staff members to find 
ways to sell the book soon after that directive staff members 
arranged book signings a distribution of copies paid for by 
lobbyists to democrats attending a party conference and an 
appearance on a televised talk show 
one ethics committee member who did not wish to be identified 
acknowledged thursday that the issue of book promotion was before 
the panel but it was unclear how serious the committee considers 
that issue 
johnson wrights spokesman said we flatly deny the 
allegation by mr cossolotto that the speaker had directed the 
staff to systematically sell the books 
wright himself conceded on wednesday that in at least one 
instance the 1984 bulk sale of 504 copies to southwest texas 
state university he had given his assent to selling the books in 
lieu of a 3000 speaking fee which he was ineligible to accept 
because he already was near the outside income limit for the year 
in at least one other case the march 1986 sale of 1000 worth 
of books in lieu of a speaking fee from midcontinent oil and gas 
association the suggestion to buy books also came from a wright 
staff aide according to a source familiar with the transaction 
wright was to ship the books not to the trade group but to schools 
in texas the source said 
johnson also disputed cossolottos account to the ethics 
committee of the request for an affidavit saying the former aide 
had initiated the conversation and volunteered to make such a 
statement then later backed out 
cossolotto and his attorney james hamilton declined to comment 
on the deposition

former vice president spiro agnew 
cannot take a deduction on his california income tax returns for 
repaying maryland for bribes he alleged accepted a state tax 
appeals board has ruled 
agnew for the past decade a resident of the affluent palm 
springs suburb of rancho mirage has already paid the disputed 
state taxes but filed an appeal seeking a 24197 refund based on 
disapproved deductions for 268462 in courtordered restitution 
fines and interest 
the california franchise tax board denied those deductions from 
agnews 1982 state income tax return in a 1986 audit agnews 
appeal of that decision was denied thursday on a unanimous 50 vote 
of the state board of equalization 
if we allow this deduction and give mr agnew the refund we 
are in effect asking other california taxpayers to subsidize mr 
agnews wrongdoing said board member conway collis 
agnew still may appeal for a rehearing or challenge the boards 
decision in court 
the us attorneys office in baltimore alleged that agnew 
received 147500 in illegal cash kickbacks from maryland highway 
contractors for awarding them road contracts beginning in 1963 when 
he was baltimore county executive and continuing while he was 
governor and vice president 
on oct 10 1973 agnew pleaded no contest to a single count of 
evading federal income taxes on the kickbacks the plea bargain in 
which agnew did not admit taking bribes netted him a threeyear 
suspended prison term and a 10000 fine he also resigned as vice 
president 
agnew was ordered to pay back taxes penalties and interest in 
1974 on the alleged illicit income 148000 to the federal 
government and 14105 to maryland 
seven years later as a result of a civil suit agnew made 
restitution to the state of maryland for the alleged bribes which 
with interest totaled 268482 
he contended that amounted to giving back income on which he had 
already paid taxes by then a california resident he deducted the 
entire amount plus 11322 in legal fees from his 1982 california 
tax return which showed more than 600000 in income

president najibs government on friday 
denounced us plans to name a special diplomatic representative to 
the afghan guerrillas 
pakistan meanwhile said the afghan government blasted 
pakistani territory with a sovietmade scud missile early friday 
no casualties were reported 
there was no confirmation by afghan authorities 
the afghan officials however reported more fighting in the 
eastern city of jalalabad acknowledging their unilateral 
ceasefire had failed hours after it was declared 
the afghan foreign ministry said the us decision to send an 
envoy for the guerrillas is not only an intervention in the 
internal affairs of afghanistan but it is also a provocative 
action that is assisting the extremists 
sources in washington said the bush administration is 
designating peter tomsen the no 2 diplomat at the us embassy in 
beijing as a special envoy to the pakistanbased guerrillas 
the moslem guerrillas have been trying for the last decade to 
oust the sovietstyle party that took power by coup and 
assassination in 1978 
on feb 23 the guerrillas selected an interim government they 
hope will replace najibs government 
government spokesman mohammad nabi amani reading the 
denunciation to reporters accused the united states of violating a 
1988 accord that paved the way for soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan and ended nine years of moscows combat support for 
kabul 
under the unsponsored accord afghanistan and pakistan agreed 
not to intervene in each others internal affairs the united 
states and the soviet union signed the accord as guarantors 
by designating a special envoy to the guerrillas the united 
states has tried to give an impetus to the fading declining 
existence of the socalled interim government amani said 
it would be better for the united states if the united states 
is truly faithfully demanding peace to pressure pakistan to stop 
intervention in the internal affairs of afghanistan he said 
kabul has accused pakistan of massing as many as 8000 of its 
soldiers and militiamen to participate in the afghan civil war 
the government spokesman acknowledged that kabul was still 
receiving soviet weapons but said this should not be compared to 
us support for the guerrillas 
afghanistan is a country that is recognized by 84 countries of 
the world amani said only three reactionary countries have 
recognized this socalled interim government saudi arabia sudan 
and bahrain 
all three are moslem nations and saudi arabia has been a major 
backer of the guerrillas along with the united states pakistan 
and china 
the united states and afghanistan have diplomatic relations but 
the united states closed its embassy and evacuated remaining 
diplomats before the soviet withdrawal was completed feb 15 
saying it feared security would deteriorate once the red army was 
gone 
kabul has remained relatively calm since the soviet pullout 
although at least 12 people were killed by guerrilla rockets this 
week 
instead the guerrillas have focused on jalalabad 75 miles east 
of kabul and 40 miles from the pakistan border 
the guerrillas launched an offensive on jalalabad on march 6 but 
so far have failed to capture it jalalabad would give the 
guerrillas an afghan base for their interim government 
amani said guerrillas and government soldiers exchanged rocket 
fire at jalalabad in the last 24 hours he said 148 opposition 
fighters nine civilians and one afghan government soldier were 
killed 
in pakistan the guerrillas afghan news agency said that 80 
afghan soldiers were killed in fighting around the city in the past 
three days 
the reports could not be confirmed since jalalabad is 
offlimits to foreign reporters and other independent observers 
amani said guerrilla fire killed three women and five children 
in khost in paktia province and government fire killed 15 
opposition fighters in kandahar province

the nations movie rating board has stuck to 
the x rating slapped on scandal about the 1960s profumo affair 
that toppled a british government despite appeals from the 
moviemaker 
the motion picture association of americas appeals board voted 
thursday in new york to sustain the x rating an action viewed as 
box office poison because few theaters show such films and 
advertisements are difficult to place 
scandal distributor miramax films recruited first amendment 
attorney martin garbus to state its case 
garbus conceded scandal was a sexy film but argued that if 
british audiences could see it so should american moviegoers 
the appeals board voted 87 to retain the x rating a twothirds 
vote of the appeals board is required to overturn an mpaa rating 
miramax lawyer dan zinkin said the close vote was unusual 
noting the board is usually unanimous he suspected the highly 
erotic content in an orgy scene guided those voting for x 
the mpaa doesnt disclose reasons for its rating decisions 
miramax must now decide whether to keep the x rating reject it 
and go out unrated or cut the offending orgy scene and resubmit it 
to the mpaa 
harvey weinstein cochairman of the film company said only 
that miramax was currently examining legal options and consulting 
with their attorneys 
scandal recreates the torrid profumo affair that brought 
down the conservative government of harold macmillan in 1963 
the movie based on the phillip knightley and carolyn kennedy 
book called an affair of state the profumo case and the framing 
of stephen ward features philandering politicians call girls 
soviet spies and the sex party 
the story surrounds the liaisons between call girl christine 
keeler war minister john profumo and soviet operative eugene 
ivanov 
british critics loved the movie but politicians condemned it 
for raking up memories of the affair that forced a minister to 
resign caused ivanovs recall and led to the suicide of ward a 
prominent osteopath 
the movie stars joanne whalleykilmer as ms keeler john hurt 
as ward ian mckellen as profumo and britt ekland as mariella 
novotny a brothel keeper 
roy hattersley deputy leader of the opposition labor party 
said the movie seems to be a disgrace to our society but 
londons daily mail praised the picture 
this account of the profumo affair is the most accomplished 
british commercial film in a long time fluent engrossing racing 
along the story capsuled long ago in that headline the minister 
the model and the russian spy the daily mail said

sen william cohen rmaine will file a 
report required by federal law stating that the east german 
government paid for one nights lodging at a conference he attended 
in june 1987 his spokeswoman said friday 
cohen was one of at least a handful of members of the house and 
senate who neglected to report travel expenses picked up by foreign 
governments as required under the 1978 foreign gifts and 
decorations act the associated press reported this week 
several lawmakers said they were unaware of the law or confused 
about its requirements it calls for any gifts or travel expenses 
paid by foreign governments to be reported on a form senators must 
report gifts over 100 house members have a ceiling of 180 
cohens spokeswoman kathy gest said information just received 
from the american embassy in east germany indicated the cost of the 
hotel was 13240 3240 over the 100 filing limit as a result 
she said cohen would file under the foreign gifts act 
it would be naive to think that anyone would intentionally 
violate the law for that amount of money she said we were 
originally under the impression that no form was required 
she said the incident raises questions about some of the 
provisions of the law and its clarity 
cohen was invited to the conference by the institute for 
eastwest security studies a nonprofit group in new york that did 
not specify the east germans would pay for the lodging 
rep doug bereuter rneb another conference participant 
estimated three nights in potsdam cost 400 
sen james exon dneb has also filed a form indicating that 
the governments of new zealand and australia paid for ground 
transportation on a trip to those places in january 1987 said mark 
bowen his spokesman 
others on the trips who did not file were sens tom harkin 
diowa larry pressler rsd and thensen john melcher dmont 
failure to file within 30 days carries a penalty on conviction 
of 5000 plus the cost of the expenses 
but officials of the senate and house ethics committees say they 
do not know of anyone being charged for failing to report travel 
expenses

senate democrats on friday reduced the size of 
the increase they are asking in the minimum wage but not enough for 
president bush who vowed again to veto any raise of more than 90 
cents over three years 
in the second day of debate on the measure democrats cut by a 
dime to 455 the minimum wage they want in effect by october 1991 
compared with the current 335 and agreed for the first time 
to a 60day subminimum for workers who are new on the job 
bush however declared he had no intention of budging one 
inch on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting that 
short a period during which employers could pay a training wage 
20 percent below the federal floor 
i will veto any bill which exceeds a 425 wage level and 
which does not contain a sixmonth training wage for new hires 
he said in a letter friday to senate republican leader bob dole 
two showdown votes were scheduled for next tuesday the first 
on the latest compromise between northern and southern democrats 
and the second on what bush said again is his only offer 
we fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first 
bush told reporters at the white house i have no inention of 
budging one inch on this i have too much at stake 
the leading proponent of the wage increase sen edward m 
kennedy dmass appeared confident he had the 51 votes to pass 
what essentially is the same bill approved by the house last month 
but he acknowledged he lacked the twothirds majority required to 
override a veto 
theyve come a long way he said of the administration 
weve come a long way i would hope they dont again lay down 
this line in the sand 
however dole said many republicans believe bush already has 
gone too far on allowing an increase 
the latest democratic plan was put together by kennedy and sens 
bob graham of florida and david pryor of arkansas 
like the housepassed bill it would provide annual 40 cent 
hourly increases to 385 an hour on oct 1 to 425 on oct 1 
1990 and to 455 a year later the orginal version called for a 
50 cent increase this year 
bushs version calls for annual 30 cent increases beginning 
next january to 365 and then up to 395 in 1991 and 425 in 
1992 the minimum wage has been frozen at 335 since 1981 
the house and new senate democratic measures differ only in the 
way they treat the 60day training wage only if it is a workers 
first job could an employer pay the lower wage in the house 
version under the senate measure a new worker would have to have 
at least 60 days of experience in one or more jobs before his 
employer would have to pay the higher scale 
bushs subminimum would allow employers to continue paying 335 
to any new hire regardless of their previousexperience for six 
months that subminimum would rise to 340 an hour in 1992 under 
the presidents proposal

thousands of palestinians rioted and stoned 
police friday outside al aqsa mosque after midday prayers on the 
first day of ramadan the moslem holy month 
police responded with rubber bullets and tear gas at least five 
policemen three palestinians and several journalists were hurt 
the hourlong battle on temple mount known to moslems as haram 
al sharif or noble sanctuary was the worst violence in a year at 
the third holiest site of islam clouds of tear gas rose from the 
hilltop in jerusalems old city dominated by the al aqsa and dome 
of the rock mosques 
a leaflet distributed by the moslem fundamentalist hamas zeal 
movement urged palestinians to welcome ramadan by escalating their 
16monthold uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip 
at least 37 palestinians were arrested police commander yosef 
yehudai said most were from the west bank and arab east jerusalem 
a similar protest occurred at hebron in the west bank hundreds 
of worshipers chanting nationalist slogans stoned soldiers who 
opened fire wounding four palestinians the army put the city 
under curfew 
jewish settlers in hebron hurled stones at arabowned vehicles 
retaliating for similar arab attacks israel radio said 
in gaza strip israeli troops shot and wounded two palestinian 
teenagers during a riot arab hospital officials said 
the violence came one day after president bush supported prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs proposal for residents of the occupied 
lands to elect representatives to negotiate with israel 
influential palestinians greeted the idea coolly and said it 
must be part of a broader program including promises to end the 
occupation and trade land for peace israel captured the west bank 
and gaza from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
hanna siniora editor of the daily al fajr said the uprising 
in which 420 palestinians and 18 israelis have been slain would 
continue until shamir comes up with a better proposal 
his paper supports the palestine liberation organization with 
which israel refuses to deal 
while siniora and other moderates expressed skepticism about 
shamirs motivation they left the door open to further 
discussions palestinian hardliners ruled out elections 
shamir said on israel radio friday there appears to be a full 
understanding between him and bush he made little of their 
differences including bushs call for an end to israeli occupation 
rioting began in jerusalem after about 25000 worshipers 
attended noon prayers on the first day of ramadan the moslem month 
of daytime fasting and religious fervor 
israeli officials have expressed fear of an escalation of the 
uprising during ramadan which marks the month the prophet mohammed 
began receiving the holy koran from allah 
al aqsa is an important national symbol to palestinians and the 
dome of the rock marks the spot from which in islamic belief 
mohammed ascended to heaven on his horse 
the 35acre rectangular platform on which the mosque coplex is 
built also is the site of the ancient jewish temple the holiest 
shrine of judaism which the romans destroyed in the year 70 
about 4000 worshipers stayed behind in the mosque complex after 
prayers friday police said 
they chanted allahu akbar god is great and 
palestine is moslem they also waved five larged palestinian 
flags and burned two israeli flags palestinian flags are illegal 
in israel 
at first only a few palestinians threw stones at the hundreds 
of police arrayed outside the courtyard walls then a policeman 
fired a shot into the air 
this shot led to the great confusion said moshe nussbaum 
an israel radio reporter seconds after the shot was fired we 
were barraged by stones 
rocks pelted dozens of journalists who had observed the prayers 
from an adjacent rooftop 
wolfgang scheider a cameraman for austrian tv was struck in 
the head and collapsed blood streaming down his face 
police fired rubber bullets and hundreds of tear gas canisters 
over the wall then entered to arrest demonstrators 
at the wailing wall which lines one side of the complex the 
ground was littered with stones the area was devoid of the jewish 
worshipers who normally crowd the site 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said if they continue to exploit 
the temple mounts sanctity for riots and harm worship at the 
western wailing wall israel will know how to deal with them 
police said they would increase security and keep some 
palestinians away from mosques

syrian gunners fired 11 howitzer shells 
into lebanons christianheld regions friday violating a fragile 
ceasefire police said no casualties were reported 
a police spokesman said eight sovietdesigned 130mm shells 
slammed into sandy beaches near the christian port of jounieh north 
of beirut early friday 
the spokesman who cannot be identified in line with standing 
rules said three other syrianfired shells exploded near the 
christian suburb of hadeth on beiruts southeastern edge friday 
afternoon 
police put the casualty toll at 177 people killed and 591 
wounded in the monthlong confrontation between gen michel aouns 
20000 christian troops and an alliance of syrian and druse forces 
the confrontation exacerbated a political crisis that created 
competing christian and moslem governments and split the army on 
sectarian lines 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon and has become the countrys 
main power broker during the long civil war aoun has declared a 
war of liberation against the syrians 
the truce was called wednesday by kuwaits foreign minister 
sheik sabah ahmed sabah who heads an arab league committee on 
lebanon 
despite the limited ceasefire violations most residents around 
beirut remained huddled in basements and underground shelters to 
avoid a sudden outbreak of hostilities 
one cant predict what might happen said adel bohsali a 
spare parts dealer in moslem west beirut im keeping my wife and 
two sons in the basement or close to it 
syrian and christian gunners briefly broke the truce at midday 
thursday with a mortar and rocket duel that wounded 15 people 
aoun has formally rejected the truce but a spokesman for aoun 
said the general would not respond to the syrian provocative fire 
if it remains within bearable limits the spokesman who cannot 
be named under standing procedure would not define those limits 
aoun has urged all lebanese factions to meet to settle to the 
14yearold civil war 
nabih berri who heads the mainstream shiite moslem amal 
militia rejected aouns offer and urged the syrians to maintain 
their troops in lebanon 
lebanons latest political crisis began sept 22 when 
parliament could not agree on a successor to president amin gemayel 
at the end of his sixyear term and gemayel named aoun to head an 
interim government 
moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to salim 
hoss the sunni moslem premier who led the government during 
gemayels administration 
under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from 
france in 1943 lebanons president is a christian the premier a 
sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
the confrontation broke out march 8 after aoun ordered a 
blockade of the private ports with which moslem militias finance 
their operations 
druse warlord walid jumblatts militia rejected the decision and 
started shelling the christianheld regions syrian troops later 
joined in

the american museum of natural history announced 
friday it would not give a 150yearold indian relic to a cree 
indian who ran across the country to retrieve it saying he wanted 
the sacred object for his people 
spokesman herbert kurz said the museum sent jim thunder an 
express mail letter to his home in edmonton canada on thursday 
notifying him of the decision 
i had been anticipating this thunder said he would not say 
if he would continue his effort to retrieve the artifact and said 
he had no further comment 
on sept 1 in edmonton the 38yearold american indian began a 
2700mile run across canada to draw attention to his mission he 
arrived march 21 in new york and formally made his request to 
museum officials the next day 
thunder claimed to be a greatgreat grandson of chief big bear 
the cree leader who created the artifact a sacred calicowrapped 
bundle holding bear claws sweet grass and a plug of tobacco to 
give his people spiritual strength and guidance 
ten years ago thunder said big bear spoke to him in dreams and 
visions and instructed him to bring the sacred bundle back to his 
tribe in western canada where it would be used in prayers and 
sacred indian ceremonies 
in 1934 a son of big bear gave the bundle to a museum 
anthropologist 
since that time it has been stored as part of a special research 
collection while it is available for study by scholars and 
indians it has never been put on display 
stanley a freed a museum curator who met with thunder told 
him in the letter that several factors including claims for the 
bundle by other cree went into the museums decision 
the museum has received communications from other cree 
asking that the medicine bundle not be given to mr thunder and 
raising questions about his relationship to big bear kurz said 
other indians and tribal groups have told the museum that the 
bundle should be given to them rather than to thunder 
thunder admits he has no blood relationship with big bear 
but said he was adopted in 1985 by a greatgranddaughter of the 
leader 
big bear made the bundle more than 150 years ago when he was 
about 13 years old and later wore it into battle for protection 
and guidance 
a son of big bear joe pimi who was also known as horse child 
sought out the museum anthropologist who was leading an 
expedition into central canada and presented it to the museum for 
safekeeping the museum said 
it is our responsibility to honor pimis wish freed wrote

former president reagan and top officials of 
his administration were more deeply involved than previously 
disclosed in efforts to encourage other countries to aid 
nicaraguas contra rebels new trial evidence shows 
a statement of facts introduced in oliver l norths trial on 
thursday in a document agreed to by the government indicated 
reagan former secretary of state george shultz and former 
secretary of defense caspar weinberger played key roles in 
providing inducements for such aid 
the threemember tower commission appointed by reagan to 
investigate the irancontra affair said in its feb 26 1987 
report that it had found no evidence to suggest that the 
president was aware of norths activities in the 198486 period 
on behalf of the rebels opposing the nicaraguan government 
direct government assistance by the united states was prohibited 
by law at the time 
the statement of facts says that in midaugust 1984 one of 
norths superiors thendeputy national security adviser john 
poindexter discussed with reagan and others a proposal ascribed to 
shultz that would allow congress to wink at lethal support for 
the resistance 
under the plan the document says the united states would 
provide military aid to el salvador which in turn would provide 
lethal aid to the resistance 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who was a 
member of the senates irancontra committee said thursday that 
such an arrangement would be clearly inappropriate possibly 
illegal 
shultz testified at the irancontra hearings that in seeking aid 
for the contras it seemed to me not a particularly good idea to 
go to countries with which we had a big military or economic 
assistance relationship because it could easily be misinterpreted 
the new document says that on feb 19 1985 national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane sent a memorandum to reagan about a 
recommendation to provide incentives to honduras to aid the contras 
the memorandum described each of the agreedupon incentives 
according to the statement of facts president reagan personally 
authorized the entire plan 
later in february it says mcfarlane asked weinberger to 
commence expedited delivery of military items as previously 
planned and personally authorized by president reagan to 
honduras 
in testimony before the congressional panels weinberger was 
asked what steps his department had taken to comply with the 
congressional cutoff of us military aid to the rebels he 
replied well we issued any instructions that were required 
by the new law but we didnt have any activities there so we 
werent really monitoring anything that wasnt happening 
reagans spokesman mark weinberg declined comment friday on 
the revelations this is a pending legal matter and we do not 
comment on developments in this trial weinberg said by telephone 
from los angeles 
neither shultz nor weinberger immediately returned telephone 
calls placed to their offices weinberger is with a washington law 
firm and shultz is on the faculty at stanford university in palo 
alto calif 
the statement of facts also quoted the late cia director william 
casey as saying at a meeting with cia and state department 
officials in midjuly of 1984 that those present ought to get 
moving on obtaining funds for the contras from sources other than 
the us government 
it goes on to quote casey as saying in that meeting that william 
french smith then attorney general had recently concluded that 
raising the funds in this manner would not be an impeachable 
offense the statement says the possibility of impeachment had 
been raised at a meeting of a national security planning group on 
june 25 1984 
smith said by telephone from los angeles i dont remember 
ever being involved in any conversation where there was any serious 
talk of impeachment 
at that time nothing had happened so i dont know why 
anybody would be talking about impeachment at that point he 
said when i say nothing had happened i mean nothing had 
happened that anybody knew about 
president bush at a news conference friday declined to discuss 
the document introduced at the trial and said that all of the 
information in it had been provided to the tower commission and 
congressional investigators 
neither former sen john g tower rtexas chairman of the 
commission nor former secretary of state edmund muskie its 
democratic member immediately returned telephone calls to their 
offices seeking comment 
the third member of the commission brent scowcroft is now 
bushs national security adviser a telephone call to him was 
referred to his spokemsan roman popadiuk who also did not 
immediately return a call 
sarah binder press secretary to rep lee hamilton dind 
chairman of the house irancontra committee said hamilton would 
have no comment until he had studied the document gregg takayama 
spokesman for sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairmana of the senate 
panel said the senator has not wanted to comment on the evidence 
that has come out at the trial

an american priest who returned 14 
years after being expelled for alleged antigovernment activity 
said friday he likes the noisy sound of democracy but officials 
told him not to step out of line 
whats going on here is healthier than what i saw the last 
time i was here said the rev james p sinnott who arrived 
wednesday to me theres nothing worse than the silence of 
suppression 
the price of democracy is a certain amount of disorder a 
certain upsetness said sinnot 59 referring to current student 
and labor unrest against the government of president roh taewoo 
roh took office last year succeeding the chun doohwan and his 
military government and has brought about democratic reforms 
but sinnott now with maryknoll missionaries in ossining ny 
said government officials have a certain amount of paranoia 
about his return 
police asked him for his itinerary and the names of people he 
plans to visit he said within 24 hours of his arrival 
immigration authorities warned him not to engage in missionary work 
or human rights campaigns 
sinnott was expelled april 30 1975 after he protested the 
arrest and execution of eight men charged with masterminding a 
communist plot against the government a charge sinnott says was 
fabricated 
at the airport on his departure sinnott donned a black hood 
representing death and pictures of that event dramatized for human 
rights activitists around the world a period of government 
repression in south korea 
he was able to return he said after intervention on his behalf 
by lee chul an outspoken south korean lawmaker and friend who in 
the early 1970s was once condemned to death for student activism 
sinnott said he wasnt always an activist for 14 of the 15 
years he lived in korea he worked in a parish at yongjongdo an 
island near the western port of inchon 
i was happy running a hospital taking care of little 
children i thought of myself as albert schweitzer he said i 
came from an upward mobile irish family in brooklyn very content 
with life civil disobedience was a thing commies do 
he said he was jolted to change by a decree issued in april 1974 
in which the government said students who publicly criticized the 
government could be sentenced to death 
my good oldfashioned world war ii american patriotism got to 
me fiftythousand men my age died in korea during the 195053 
korean war i told myself if you dont say something youll 
suffocate 
a us diplomat first called him a dissident i thought my 
god if im a dissident then theres something wrong in my 
culture dissident was a bad word he said i now accept it as 
an honorable title 
sinnott said he became tied to the case of the eight men after 
their wives and families appealed to the church for help and

make drexel burnham lambert inc a wall street powerhouse pleaded 
innocent friday to a wideranging federal indictment that charged 
him with turning the firm into a racketeering enterprise 
milken entered his plea in a courtroom packed with more than 200 
reporters lawyers and friends outside dozens of supporters some 
wearing hats that read mike milken we believe in you applauded 
and cheered him as he left the courthouse without comment 
also pleading innocent before us district judge kimba wood at 
federal court in manhattan was milkens brother lowell 40 a 
third defendant former drexel trader bruce l newberg was absent 
due to a skiing accident he will be arraigned at a later date

racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury march 29

rear door flanked by his lawyers arthur liman and martin 
flumenbaum his wife lori sat in the second row of the crowded 
spectator section 
the standing room only crowd laughed when ms wood asked him how 
he felt and michael milken replied ok your honor 
lowell milken dressed in a gray suit said i plead not 
guilty in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge 
both milkens were released without having to post bail after 
assistant us attorney john carroll said prosecutors and defense 
lawyers had made substantial progress during talks to reach an 
acceptable bond for the defendants and their assets 
the charges seek 18 billion in forfeitures from each of the 
three defendants or their total combined earnings from 1984 to 
1987 the government reportedly had asked the three defendants each 
to post a 1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on their 
assets 
under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations

subject to forfeiture and prosecutors could ask the judge to freeze 
the milkens assets to guarantee their availability in the event of 
conviction 
if convicted each of the three also faces maximum fines of 37 
billion if convicted on either or both of the racketeering counts 
those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal 
racketeering law double the gains made from the allegedly 
illegal enterprise that a judge may impose

finalize bond arrangements the judge also scheduled newbergs 
arraignment april 25 
following his indictment milken 42 took a leave of absence

1 billion between 1983 and 1987

securities a key source of financing for a wide range of corporate 
deals he is also credited with helping to transform drexel into a 
major investment banking house 
the racketeering indictment followed an investigation of wall 
streets fifthlargest investment firm that lasted more than two 
years the probe was prompted by information supplied by convicted 
stock speculator ivan boesky

an assailant who lost a court battle to 
block his comatose victim from being removed from life support 
could face a murder charge now that the man has died prosecutors 
said friday 
twentysixyearold mark weaver died friday eight days after 
his family removed his feeding tube and four years after the 
stabbing that left him in a coma noel pagan who pleaded guilty to 
assaulting weaver waged an unsuccessful court battle to keep him 
alive to avoid risking more serious charges 
we havent ruled anything in or out the chief of the 
attorney generals criminal division fernand larochelle said when 
asked friday whether homicide charges would be sought were just 
trying to determine what the evidence is 
a medical examiner was performing an autopsy at maine medical 
center but authorities did not know how soon it would be 
completed attorney general james e tierney would not comment on 
the type of autopsy findings would be necessary before pagan could 
be charged with weavers death 
im not going to answer any hypothetical questions about an 
autopsy being conducted tierney said 
weavers mother sylvia lane said her son died at about 2 am 
he died peacefully she said he never had a moments 
pain 
when she removed her sons feeding tube just after midnight 
march 30 she had said it would take from one to two weeks for him 
to die 
pagans attorney robert mullen said he would try to persuade 
prosecutors that no additional charges should be filed 
its up to them mullen said ill probably call them and 
say now that hes passed away id like to do anything i can to 
talk them out of charges 
while her son was still alive ms lane had said that it would 
make no sense to seek further punishment of pagan who is now on 
probation and living in wellesley mass mullen said pagan 29 has 
been staying out of trouble since his release after three years in 
prison 
janet mills the androscoggin county district attorney who 
negotiated pagans guilty plea to an aggravated assault charge in 
1985 said the stabbing occurred during a stupid street fight 
in lewiston 
authorities believe pagan and weaver did not even know each 
other ms mills said friday from auburn it wasnt like one of 
them set out to murder the other she said i think weaver was 
calling some names 
mullen said that if charges are filed he will try to get them 
thrown out with motions instead of going to trial 
he said he would cite constitutional provisions against trying 
people twice for the same offense and a state law providing that a 
person must die within a year and a day of an attack before the 
attacker can be charged with murder or manslaughter

mikhail s gorbachevs declared intention to close 
facilities that produce weaponsgrade radioactive material is the 
first comment by a soviet leader on an area that has been a deep 
military secret 
under the soviet leaders reform policies and in arms 
negotiations some information has been given about conventional 
forces chemical weapons and nuclear missiles 
he has used this more open attitude to press the united states 
and its allies for arms control agreements gorbachev needs to 
redirect soviet resources toward making the economy work 
until he spoke friday in london revelations about production of 
uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons remained offlimits 
gorbachev said in addition to the industrial reactor for the 
production of weaponsgrade plutonium shut down in 1987 we plan to 
shut down two other such reactors this year and next year without 
commissioning new units to replace them 
the soviet union began allowing inspection of nuclear power 
plants after the april 1986 explosion and fire at chernobyl which 
killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radiation that 
spread around the world 
it had not announced the closing of the reactor in 1987 
however and no information had been available on what kinds of 
facilities or how many the soviets had for producing 
weaponsgrade material 
ussr energy atlas a cia study of all soviet energy 
sources devotes only a little more than three of its 70 pages to 
nuclear power because so much is concealed 
information on the soviet uranium industry is a closely 
guarded state secret the report says only limited data on 
uranium occurrences in the soviet union and minor details on 
reserves mining and processing operations have been published 
francois heisbourg director of the institute of strategic 
studies in london said after gorbachevs announcement the soviets 
have a considerable stockpile of plutonium for nuclear weapon 
under the ussoviet treaty eliminating intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles us inspectors have been given the unprecedented 
right to inspect soviet missile sites 
fifteen inspections were made last summer to verify deployment 
sites and numbers and classes of weapons to be destroyed tass the 
official news agency quoted brig gen roland lajoie as saying he 
was staggered by the openness showed by the soviets 
in september observers were allowed to witness a soviet nuclear 
test 
soviet officials have said that after the ussoviet missile 
treaty and gorbachevs announcement at the united nations in 
december of unilateral military cuts they are converting some arms 
plants to produce goods for the domestic economy 
officials said dec 21 the engines from 10000 decommissioned 
tanks would be diverted to domestic use several weeks later state 
media reported that 250 arms plants would be incorporated into 
efforts to design and build new food processing equipment

a report to congress said friday that current 
farm law which is set to expire next year has helped improve the 
state of us agriculture 
the general accounting office said the food security act of 1985 
was designed to help stabilize the farm economy enhance us 
agricultural exports and prevent the buildup of large surplus 
stocks of commodities 
john w harman gaos director of food and agriculture issues 
said that in summary progress has been made toward the major 
goals of the 1985 law 
most economic indicators have turned positive harman said 
exports have increased and stock levels of surplus commodities 
have generally moved lower 
but harman said in his letter to sens rudy boschwitz rminn 
and bill bradley dnj who had asked for the gao study that 
while the 1985 law has been a factor it is uncertain how much 
progress can be attributed to the legislation versus other 
important factors such as monetary exchange rates 
the law includes a number of provisions that enabled the reagan 
administration to pursue its goal of marketoriented 
agriculture including lower support prices for major farm 
commodities so they could compete more easily in world trade 
similar goals have been expressed by the bush administration 
including agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who has pushed 
vigorously for more global elbow room for us products 
the report said that usdas total costs for price and income 
supports and export programs were slightly higher under the 
first three full years of the 1985 farm law than in the last 
three full years of the previous legislation 
also it said usda has had higher administrative costs 
because it increased staff levels to handle the greater work 
load under the 1985 law even with more staff usda has found 
its greater responsibilities difficult to administer the report 
added 
the previous law which was adopted in 1981 cost about 438 
billion for its final three full years compared with 487 billion 
in the first three full years of the 1985 law the report said 
gao said those figures did not include fiscal 1986 when total 
farm commodity outlays were a record of 258 billion because it 
was a transition year in which some spending were attributable to 
crops produced under the 1981 laws programs and other crops under 
the 1985 version

the united states on friday praised a call by 
a leader of lebanons christians for political reform saying it 
could open the way to resolving some of the fundamental problems 
tearing the country apart 
the comments appeared to indicate a state department tilt toward 
the christians who have been fighting a coalition of moslem 
militiamen and their syrian backers in the worst round of civil 
violence lebanon has known for four years 
it was the first time in the latest round of artillery duels 
which began four weeks ago that the state department has departed 
from its language of neutrality 
gen michel aoun who leads the christian units in lebanons 
army on thursday called for a conference between the warring sides 
to discuss powersharing between christians and moslems 
we have achieved equality in humiliation for 14 years aoun 
said we have to acquire equality today in responsibility 
liberation dignity and partnership 
we have to be partners in making out destiny because this 
partnership alone is bound to realize justice equality and equal 
opportunities in a full national sense he said 
aoun said the lebanese will have to pay much more dearly if they 
delay in achieving unity security dignity stability and 
reconstruction of their homeland 
we welcome the commitment that general aoun made said the 
state department we applaud his recognition that all lebanese 
have the right to security liberty and dignity 
lebanons factional violence stems from a political structure 
instituted in the 1940s which favors the christians over the 
moslems but the moslems who have increased their numbers and now 
constitute a majority in lebanon are demanding a bigger share in 
running the country 
syria sent troops into lebanon in 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate but lebanons christians contend the 40000 
syrians are now an occupying power 
we are required at once to reject subordination and to rebel 
against the oppressive foreign will aoun said we must 
overthrow all dictated barriers and handicaps that would lead to 
partition and meet around a lebaneselebanese table for a free 
meaningful open and honest national dialogue 
richard boucher a state department spokesman said aouns call 
is another step down the road to a settlement in lebanon but 
he conceded that i cant say that we can be optimistic about the 
situation i think this shows a path to resolving some of the 
fundamental problems that are there and thats why we support it

president bush declaring that the climate 
is better than its been for a while said friday that the 
election plan for palestinian arabs proposed by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir represents a welcome step toward progress 
in the middle east peace process 
shamir meantime told reporters he sees no role for the 
palestine liberation organization in persuading the arab residents 
of the israelioccupied west bank and gaza to take part in such 
elections 
in the middle east a little step sometimes can prove to 
be fruitful bush said adding that i think the climate is 
better than its been for a while 
bush answering questions from reporters at the white house 
said it is too early for him to consider traveling to the region to 
try to resolve the arabisraeli conflict 
asked if he saw himself getting personally involved over the 
course of his presidency in trying to deal with the situation bush 
said that if i felt that being immersed in it would help solve 
the problem of peace in the middle east i would do that 
but he said that it is not a time when a lot of 
highvisibility missions on the part of the president can be 
helpful in the process 
as for the proposed elections which shamir suggested as a way 
to select arab delegates to meet with the israeli government bush 
was asked whether the plo should have a role 
bush said that we havent fully resolved exactly whos going 
to have a role but i think thats a matter to be determined 
between the parties the plo has people living on the west 
bank we want to see elections that are free and fair there 
shamir speaking with reporters after meeting at the capitol 
with senate leaders and members of the senate foreign relations 
committee made clear he intends to avoid plo participation 
i dont think the plo could help he said i see the plo 
always as an obstacle on the way to peace in our area the plo is 
against peace with us and therefore i cannot say anything about any 
way the plo could help 
shamir was asked whether in that case elections represent a 
dead end 
he did not reply directly but said 
as i said before the plo is against all of my proposals 
because they dont want to see us to see israel in peace 
relations with the arab peoples and nations and therefore it is 
useless to talk with the plo 
later in an interview with cable news network shamir said that 
elections can be held even if some of the palestinian participants 
are sympathetic to the plo if these people will accept the 
principle accept the process of negotiations 
shamirs plan calls for the election of palestinian leaders to 
negotiate temporary selfrule after a trial period he proposes to 
have israel the palestinians egypt and jordan work out a 
permanent settlement 
shamir told cnn the process would take at least five years 
and that the initial period of selfrule would be a test to see 
if it is possible to have peaceful coexistence 
the 1978 camp david accords called for a fiveyear trial period 
of palestinian autonomy followed by negotiations for an overall 
final settlement 
shamir presented his proposal to bush on thursday at a news 
conference the prime minister ruled out having international 
observers on hand for the elections which he said would be run by 
israeli officials 
we do not think there is a need of international 
supervision he said israel has a long tradition of democracy 
and decent and honest elections 
shamir contends a majority of the 14 million palestinian arabs 
living under israeli control would take part in such elections 
because they want a peaceful solution 
violence has held sway in the occupied lands since a palestinian 
uprising erupted in december 1987 killing 420 palestinians and 18 
israelis 
shamir opposes establishment of an independent palestinian state 
on the west bank and in gaza saying an arab nation there would 
become a launching pad for terrorist strikes against israel

a man who claimed the city was negligent in the 
traffic death of his wife actually has two wives and both of them 
are alive 
police began piecing together the saga of robert jerome brown of 
dallas when he was arrested for auto theft last month 
that started texas and arkansas officials on whirlwind 
investigation that has uncovered suspects in an unsolved 1986 
slaying a phony identification of a traffic accident victim and 
two wives one of whom says she was never near a dallas freeway 
accident that brown contended had killed her 
brown 33 and one of his wives sonja brown 20 remained 
jailed friday in malvern ark on capital murder charges stemming 
from an unrelated incident 
the two face arraignment on the capital murder charges monday 
officials said 
this is a very bizarre case said homicide detective james 
gallagher if he didnt have this small problem with this 
homicide case up in arkansas im sure wed see quite a few more 
charges against him 
in january 1988 brown identified the body of a woman who was 
struck and killed while walking across a dallas highway as his 
estranged wife jacquelyn brown 34 of alport ark when brown 
said he had no money to bury his wife the body was placed in a 
dallas county paupers grave 
then brown allegedly hired an attorney to file a wrongful death 
lawsuit against the city claiming negligence in not placing a 
street light in the area 
but browns other wife sonja tipped off gallagher that there 
might be something mysterious about jacquelyn browns death 
gallagher called jacquelyn browns parents after reviewing her 
death certificate and was startled to learn the woman was still 
alive he also learned the woman had been estranged from brown for 
several years but never divorced 
initially she was surprised gallagher said of jacquelyn 
browns reaction to the news of her reported death but then when 
i told her who had made these allegations she wasnt too 
surprised 
calls from the associated press to jacquelyn browns home in 
arkansas were not answered friday 
brown a stuttgart ark native who had been living in dallas 
was apprehended march 3 while driving through texas to shreveport 
la the car had been stolen in arkansas said hot springs ark 
county chief deputy leonard tisdale 
under questioning by arkansas officials brown confessed that he 
and his wife sonja had strangled a little rock prostitute in 1986 
and left her body on interstate 30 tisdale said 
the body of gloria j reynolds 24 was found about six miles 
south of malvern just past a highway rest stop on dec 4 1986 
tisdale said she had been robbed of 50 and strangled with a belt 
gallagher said dallas police began questioning sonja brown about 
her alleged role in the murder and she admitted brown had told her 
he was somehow involved in jacquelyns death 
when jacquelyn brown was found alive dallas police began an 
investigation into the real identity of the traffic accident victim 
gallagher said he is waiting for fingerprints to arrive from los 
angeles to confirm who is in the grave 
gallagher said police believe browns motive in claiming the 
unidentified body appears to be money from the lawsuit against the 
city but he never followed up on the suit

foreign participation in the super collider 
raises national security implications that must be investigated 
texas gov bill clements said friday as he sought such a review 
from president bush and defense secretary dick cheney 
before we actively pursue foreign participation in the 
project due to be built in his state we have an obligation to 
make a considered judgment on what are the national security 
implications in this project this is a vitally important 
question clements said 
clements met with bush and said he had also raised the issue 
with sen lloyd bentsen dtexas cheney energy secretary james 
watkins national security adviser brent scowcroft and members of 
congress including rep tom bevill dala whose house 
appropriations subcommittee will set spending for the collider in 
next years budget 
everybodys in agreement that an evaluation of the national 
security aspect has to be thoroughly explored and determined before 
we get in to some kind of a foreign participation clements said 
at a recent hearing of his subcommittee bevill suggested 
congress would not be willing to fund construction of the collider 
unless foreign governments agree to help pay for it bevill said 
congress would insist on knowing specifically how much each foreign 
contributor planned to spend bush is seeking 250 million to begin 
construction next year for the particle accelerator at a site south 
of dallas 
clements said he met with bevill on thursday and he 
acknowledges that this area of national security needs to be fully 
explored

president bush welcomed presidentelect 
alfredo cristiani of el salvador to the white house on friday 
assuring him of us support for his rightist government in 
battling leftist rebels 
cristiani and a white house statement issued after their oval 
office meeting said the two discussed a shared commitment to 
democracy and protection of human rights in el salvador 
earlier in the day cristiani rejected a proposal by the rebels 
that he declare his forthcoming administration a transitional 
government and call for new elections in return the rebels would 
have agreed to a ceasefire 
the human rights question has been controversial for cristiani 
as head of the rightwing arena party which along with its 
founder roberto dabuisson has been accused of affiliations with 
rightist death squads that have killed tens of thousands of 
leftists 
an administration source said one purpose of the white house 
meeting was to underscore us expectations that the new salvadoran 
government which replaces the moderate christian democratic 
government of jose napoleon duarte will be aggressive in keeping 
human rights violations in check 
vice president dan quayle on a trip to el salvador in feburary 
delivered a strong prohuman rights message to the military forces 
linking improved performance in that area with the continuation of 
us aid to the central american nation 
the white house said that bush dismissed those who have 
prejudged cristiani and contend he will be weak on human rights 
bush restated his view that mr cristiani should be given the 
chance to prove his dedication to democracy peace and human 
rights 
bush also noted with satisfaction cristianis efforts in 
getting court charges in a human rights case reinstated after a 
judge threw out the case and ordered the release of two military 
men and a landowner accused of involvement in a kidnapforprofit 
ring the white house said 
he said it showed we really meant it when we said that we are 
willing to work for the respect of human rights in salvador 
cristiani said 
the ceasefire proposal by the rebels announced thursday 
contemplated elections six months after a ceasefire was in place 
the proposal demanded the withdrawal of us aid and military 
advisers to el salvador and would have barred military forces from 
polling places 
but cristiani who handily defeated his opponents in the march 
19 ballotting rejected the plan saying he would not consider 
naming his a transitional government as proposed by the rebel 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
he said his government will be willing to talk with the rebels 
to try to seek a means to bring them into the political civililan 
life in el salvador

president bush on friday shrugged off 
complaints by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that the us 
review of arms control policy was delaying negotiations to harness 
the nuclear arms race 
we are making a prudent review i will be ready to discuss with 
the soviets when we are ready bush said and so and mr 
gorbachev knows that there is no footdragging going on so im 
not concerned in the least 
the state department meanwhile dismissed as meaningless an 
announcement by gorbachev that he would close two more nuclear 
reactors that produce weaponsgrade uranium 
it will not restrain their nuclear weapons program 
spokesman richard boucher said its not really a change in 
soviet nuclear production capabilities 
he said the soviets would retain military and civilian plants 
that produce material that could be used for weapons 
the coolness of the us reaction to gorbachev was enhanced 
later by a state department announcement that listening devices had 
been discovered at the us consulate in leningrad 
a brief statement said the department had protested telling the 
soviets such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering however 
long ago they may have been initiated are deeply resented by the 
american people 
gorbachev on a visit to britain said through a spokesman on 
thursday that in arms control continuity is the name of the game 
we are a little bit apprehensive we could be losing it 
bush with a flash of irritation in a session in the white house 
press room said he would be ready to discuss the arms situation 
with the soviets when his administrations review is completed 
that is expected at the end of the month or at the latest in 
early may 
secretary of state james a baker iii will go to moscow may 
1011 to discuss the suspended negotiations with the soviets and 
also prospects for a first summit meeting between bush and 
gorbachev 
the state department in announcing the trip said baker would 
stop at the north atlantic treaty organization headquarters in 
brussels belgium on the way home to brief us allies on the 
results 
the negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear missiles bombers 
and submarines went into recess in december and were tentatively 
set to resume in midfebruary but the bush administration 
postponed the resumption for the review which includes an analysis 
of us nuclear forces 
on a related subject gorbachev promised friday to make deep 
cuts in the soviet military and made the announcement that he would 
close two more nuclear reactors 
asked for his appraisal bush deflected the question we will 
react when we are ready to react he said 
bush had said previously he would not be stampeded by 
gorbachevs various initiatives which included a pledge to reduce 
soviet troops by 500000 and to remove six tank divisions from 
eastern europe 
gorbachev criticized the lengthy us review through gennady 
gerasimov the soviet foreign policy spokesman who said on 
thursday the new administration has not yet decided what position 
to take how to interpret the international scene continuity is 
the name of the game 
administration officials suspect the soviets tactic may be to 
try to promote division within nato bush and baker will meet with 
leaders of the alliance in brussels at the end of may 
asked if the allies were critical of the review boucher said 
i havent heard any such criticism 
on another subject bush called the pace of reform in poland 
mindboggling and all very encouraging 
on wednesday polish government authorities agreed to legalize 
solidarity the independent trade union and to provide for 
democratic elections in the east european country 
bush said he had not decided whether he should consider a visit 
to poland 
asked about the middle east the president described the 
situation as marginally improved 
referring to a proposal by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
to hold elections among palestinian arabs on the west bank and in 
gaza the president said 
in the middle east a little step sometimes can be fruitful i 
think the climate is better than it has been 
but bush said it was too early for him to consider traveling to 
the region to try to resolve the arabisraeli conflict 
if i personally can be helpful i am going to do it he 
said but it is not a time when a lot of highvisibility missions 
on the part of the president can be helpful in the process 
as for the proposed elections which shamir suggested as a way 
to find palestinian leaders to work out local selfrule with his 
government bush said 
we havent fully resolved exactly whos going to have a role 
thats a matter to be determined between the parties the plo 
has people living on the west bank we want to see elections 
that are free and fair

the head of unesco on friday called for freedom for 
two journalists and other hostages held in lebanon and an end to 
violence in that country 
federico mayor directorgeneral of the un educational 
scientific and cultural organization noted the third anniversary 
on april 17 of the kidnapping of british television journalist john 
mccarthy 32 
mayor said in a statement that the british journalist has now 
passed three years of his life deprived of his freedom denied the 
right to exercise his profession and robbed of the joys of home and 
family 
alas he is not alone others are in the same intolerable 
situation in the middle east including another journalist terry 
anderson 
anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press began his fifth year in captivity in lebanon three weeks 
ago he was abducted march 16 1985 and is the longestheld among 
the 15 foreign hostages who include nine americans 
a group of british french and other journalists are organizing 
a ceremony at unesco april 17 to mark mccarthys captivity 
mayor said unesco is deeply concerned with the fate of the 
hostages because one of its responsibilities in advancing 
individual human rights is to promote the free exchange of ideas

are under the umbrella group hezbollah over which iran is believed 
to exercise control last week mayor sent an envoy to talk with the 
iranian government 
mayor also said he was concerned about the people of lebanon

and around beirut 
i appeal to all governments concerned and to the international

long suffering and hardship of this afflicted people he said

palestinians made clear friday a usbacked 
israeli call for elections in the west bank and gaza strip would 
not stop the uprising against israeli occupation 
demonstrations in jerusalem and the west bank followed hard on 
the heels of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs meeting 
thursday with president bush the protests signaled that 
palestinians believe the us pledge to work on the election idea 
was inadequate 
plo chairman yasser arafat speaking in the congo attacked 
shamirs proposal as inappropriate as usual and vowed the 
uprising would continue until victory he reiterated a call for 
an international conference but it was uncertain from his comments 
whether he ruled out the election idea 
in amman jordan two elected mayors deported from the 
israelioccupied west bank denounced shamirs proposed elections 
as one who was elected back in 1976 i would remind mr shamir 
that those who were elected are either expelled by the israelis 
or dead or dismissed said mohammed milhem former mayor of 
halhoul deported in 1980 
abduljawad saleh mayor of elbireh until he was deported in 
1973 said the problem is they didnt understand that we are one 
people with one leadership the plo 
both men in interviews supported plo suggestions that 
elections might take place after israel withdraws from the 
territories 
some influential palestinians in the occupied territories 
indicated elections might be possible if certain conditions were 
met such as un supervision and a withdrawal of israeli troops 
their comments appeared to give the us government some leeway to 
explore the idea 
the plo doesnt even have to openly agree to the idea the plo 
just has to let the process start we just need an atmosphere that 
will let things take off said an israeli official who demanded 
anonymity 
shamirs plan is to hold elections in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip to choose palestinian representatives to talk with 
israel about establishing autonomy as an interim arrangement talks 
on the ultimate disposition of the warwon land would be left until 
later 
but many palestinians said they feared he sought only an 
arrangement to halt the uprising and was not sincere about seeking 
a longterm settlement 
the interim solution will become a permanent solution we have 
no trust in the israeli side on this matter said nablus 
businessman said kenaan 
in a television interview friday shamir said if we reach an 
agreed solution in the negotiations it would not be possible 
to call it occupation in any case it will not be occupation 
nabil jabari chairman of the nowclosed hebron university in 
the west bank said the palestine liberation organization would 
have to authorize an international body to supervise the balloting 
and elections would have to be part of a larger settlement 
i could not agree to elections if it is only elections it 
must be part of a package to solve the palestinian problem said 
jabari who spent 65 days in jail without trial for proplo 
activities during the uprising 
palestinians interviewed friday said israel would have to accept 
giving up land it seized in the 1967 middle east war and end the 
military occupation over the 17 million arabs in the west bank and 
gaza 
shamir has to announce that he accepts the principle of 
territory for peace said bethlehem mayor elias freij who 
received death threats earlier this year after proposing a truce in 
the uprising in exchange for elections and prisoner releases 
palestinian leftists and prosyrian supporters ruled out 
shamirs latest proposal 
no and a thousand times no to the elections and even to the 
dialogue with israelis under occupation said sufian khatib of 
jerusalem a surgeon whose views are associated with damascusbased 
popular front for the liberation of palestine 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr newspaper 
said he thinks the uprising in the occupied lands will continue 
until shamir comes up with a better proposal 
an israeli official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity said shamirs proposal to bush did not link elections to 
the return of calm to the west bank and gaza where at least 419 
palestinians have died since december 1987 
the official said israel hoped that international reaction would 
be favorable to the election idea if international public 
opinion accepts i think the palestinians would not have an easy 
time rejecting it he said 
the liberal daily haaretz and the conservative maaariv 
newspapers concurred shamir had only won a time out haaretz 
said the impression is that the bush administration is not going 
to let shamir off the hook soon 
finance minister shimon peres head of the leftleaning labor 
party and shamirs rival in the coalition government expressed 
some skepticism about shamirs plan i still dont see a second 
side for negotiations and the question is whether we can find 
palestinian representatives he was quoted as saying by the 
national news agency itim

oliver north conceded friday he lied to 
congressmen who came to the white house to question him about the 
contras but he said he didnt think it was unlawful because the 
things he was hiding i was told could not should not be 
revealed 
i felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants 
he testified 
the courtroom at his criminal trial was packed and long lines 
formed in the hallway outside as the former national security 
council aide spent his second day in the witness chair undergoing 
gentle examination by his own lawyer brendan sullivan 
at the white house meanwhile president bush citing concern 
about endangering the trial refused to answer questions about 
his own role in aiding the contras as disclosed in a lengthy 
admission of facts introduced by norths lawyers on thursday 
the court statement agreed to by both the government and 
norths lawyers said bush got several north memoranda regarding 
the secret operation to aid the contras and also flew to honduras 
to tell that nations president of expedited us aid which was 
aimed at inducing honduras to help the contras as well 
in court friday the jury was read a dear ollie note that 
bush then vice president sent north at thanksgiving in november 
1985 
one of the many things i have to be thankful for is the way in 
which you have performed under fire in tough situations said the 
note written on the back of a picture your dedication to the 
hostage thing and central america gives me cause for great pride 
on the witness stand north testified that to fend off the 
possibility of a broader congressional inquiry he agreed to meet 
with the house intelligence committee in the white house on august 
1986 
the 12 felony charges against him include obstructing congress 
in saying he didnt give military advice to the nicaraguan contras 
and didnt raise money for them 
did you tell the truth at that meeting on aug 6 1986 
sullivan asked 
no said north 
do you believe your conduct was unlawful 
no i didnt think that it was unlawful 
i was put in a situation having been raised to know what the 
ten commandments are and knowing it would be wrong to do that but 
i went into the meeting not believing it would be illegal not to 
tell congress the truth and thats why i didnt think the meeting 
would be a good idea 
did north tell all that to adm john poindexter who was the 
presidents national security adviser and norths boss 
yes 
and what was his position 
you can take care of it 
poindexter north said was worried that a 100 million contra 
aid package which was about to be approved by congress would be 
imperiled if the administration refused to respond to congress 
i told him the heart of the congressional resolution of 
inquiry was about all kinds of things that couldnt be addressed 
and he and i both knew what they were north testified an 
apparent reference to secret white house efforts to help the 
contras at a time when congess had banned official us aid 
these things i had done i was told could not should not be 
revealed 
north said he wanted the reagan white house to invoke executive 
privilege and refuse to answer any questions but was brushed aside 
by his boss 
you start howling about executive privilege and its just 
going to make it more difficult for everybody north said 
poindexter told him 
north also testified friday that he complained that a key letter 
sent to capitol hill by robert mcfarlane poindexters predecessor 
as national security adviser was totally inconsistent with the 
facts and all this was going to do was add fuel to the fire 
north said the answer he wanted to give was wrong it was not 
factual 
that letter forms the basis of one of the charges although it 
was signed by mcfarlane prosecutors charge that north drafted it 
north also contradicted mcfarlane by testifying he altered 
classified memos at mcfarlanes direction 
the memos showed what i had been doing at his direction in 
central america for the contras the delivery of arms working 
with general secord and building the resistance north told 
the jury 
richard secord a former major general was enlisted by north to 
run arms to the contras 
mcfarlane however had testified at the trial that north came 
to him unsolicited with a few proposed changes but that mcfarlane 
threw them away 
north said he had balked at making the changes when mcfarlane 
first asked in 1985 
but in november 1986 as the irancontra affair was surfacing 
mcfarlane by then out of the nsc but having returned to help 
reconstruct an account of the iran arms initiative again asked 
north about the memos 
i havent taken care of it yet but i will north said he 
told mcfarlane norths former secretary fawn hall testified 
earlier that on instructions from north she altered the documents 
by deleting numerous references to norths direct involvement with 
the contras 
it never occurred to me it was unlawful north said 
on another point north said there was wide dissemination to top 
administration officials of sensitive intelligence about the 
northarranged delivery of missiles from israel to iran at the time 
it took place one of the charges against north is that he prepared 
a chronology in november 1986 denying that anyone in the government 
knew in 1985 that what was labeled oil drilling equipment 
actually consisted of missiles 
north who testified nearly five hours and will return on 
monday also was asked by sullivan about a 13800 security fence 
built around his house and paid for by secord also the basis of a 
criminal charge 
q did you intend to violate the law 
a no i intended to pay for it 
q did you ever pay for it 
a no i did not

a man was charged with murder friday 
after he confessed to a priest that he killed his girlfriend and 
daughter and stuffed their bodies in a refrigerator 
the priest persuaded the man stephen a vrabel 32 to turn 
himself in after the two talked about 30 minutes in a confessional 
thursday 
vrabel of struthers was ordered held on 2 million bond on two 
counts of aggravated murder in the deaths of susan clemente 29 
and 2yearold lisa clemente 
ms clementes landlord michael e aey discovered the bodies 
wednesday night when he went to the apartment where vrabel and ms 
clemente lived to determine why they were behind in their rent 
her body was found in the refrigerator wrapped in blankets 
sheets and a pillow tied around her with rope the toddlers body 
was bundled with two teddy bears blankets and a pillow and stuffed 
in the freezer compartment both had been shot in the head 
authorities said 
vrabel turned himself in thursday in the cleveland suburb of 
parma after hearing news reports that the bodies had been found and 
confessing to the rev john carlin pastor of st charles roman 
catholic church carlin said he did not know vrabel who apparently 
was driving through the neighborhood and spotted the church 
he told me that he has killed his wife and daughter carlin 
recounted in a telephone interview yes i was scared 
carlin a priest for 13 years called the confessional a movie 
scenario 
although confessions are considered confidential carlin said

released him from any obligation of secrecy once when they were 
alone and the second time in front of three parma police officers 
asked whether vrabel mentioned a motive carlin said friday 
he told me nothing he said he wouldnt comment on it even if

the festive atmosphere that welcomed joyce 
kennard to the california supreme court this week bore no 
resemblance to the armed camp that greeted the courts only other 
female justice rose bird a dozen years ago 
perhaps an even greater contrast can be found in kennards own 
life 
when i was living in a quonset hut in the jungles of new 
guinea i never thought i would make it to america let alone 
achieve what i have the 47yearold jurist told reporters after 
her unanimous confirmation by the states commission on judicial 
appointments 
kennard is an immigrant who arrived alone in los angeles at 20 
with few resources shes a straighta student who went through 
college graduate school and law school in six years while working 
at least 20 hours a week a wellliked lawyer and judge who spent 
only a year at each court level before reaching the top 
as an infant she was held in a japanese internment camp in her 
native indonesia later she and her mother lived in poverty in a 
segregated village in new guinea she lost a leg to a 
lifethreatening infection at 16 in the netherlands 
a colleague at her last job appeals court justice armand 
arabian described her to the commission as this wondrous waif of 
destiny asked if she had any weaknesses he said none known 
to mortals 
described by commentators as moderate to conservative kennard 
does not alter the balance on the court controlled 52 by 
appointees of republican gov george deukmejian the retiring 
justice she succeeded john arguelles was the most moderate of 
deukmejians appointees 
but she adds some diversity to a court that in its 140 years 
has never had a justice of asian descent and has had only one other 
woman who arrived in very different circumstances 
bird named chief justice of a thenliberal court by democratic 
gov jerry brown in 1977 was a figure of controversy from the 
start 
a former public defender and brown cabinet member with no 
judicial experience she came to the court determined to break up 
the oldboy network that had long controlled administration and 
hiring 
she was met with resentment that she aggravated with a blunt 
manner 
the internal antagonisms eased somewhat over the years but 
birds external opposition grew after narrowly surviving her 
initial 1977 confirmation vote and her first statewide election in 
1978 she was swept out of office in a 1986 campaign that focused 
on the courts frequent reversals of death sentences 
two other liberals also were voted out clearing the way for 
deukmejian to appoint a conservative majority to the court for the 
first time in 30 years 
the governors first five appointees all men have swung the 
court to the right affirming death sentences about 70 percent of 
the time and ruling in favor of insurers and employers in major 
cases 
kennard after four years as a deputy attorney general and six 
as a research lawyer for an appeals court has spent only three 
years on the bench one each at the municipal superior and 
appellate courts her written record amounts to 11 precedential 
opinions none in highprofile cases 
but she got glowing testimonials from judicial colleagues and 
lawyers who have appeared before her and not one unfavorable 
letter among 22 written to the commission the state bar assessed 
her as wellqualified its secondhighest rating apparently 
because of her relative inexperience 
in a brief session with reporters kennard described herself as 
sensitive to womens issues without elaborating

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on friday 
announced cuts in the production of radioactive material for 
nuclear weapons and ended a triumphant stop in britain by inviting 
queen elizabeth ii to moscow 
prime minister margaret thatcher declared gorbachevs visit 
very successful warm and friendly but appeared unimpressed by 
his concessions in the military field 
she said the reductions in weaponsgrade material will have no 
effect in practice because they probably have quite a 
sufficient stockpile of uranium 
in washington president bush declined to comment on gorbachevs 
announcement saying he had not had time to review its significance 
a pentagon official said the steps sketched by gorbachev would 
not have a major impact on soviet capability to wage nuclear war 
although gorbachev said arms control would stall unless the west 
dropped plans to modernize its shortrange nuclear missiles mrs 
thatcher said her belief in a nuclear deterrent remains firm 
gorbachev insisted nato had an advantage over the warsaw pact in 
every area but tanks and said in short fears of the soviet 
military threat are groundless 
mrs thatcher said east bloc forces still outnumber the western 
alliance 21 
on a happier note she said the queen gave a very definite 
yes to the invitation extended during gorbachevs lunch with 
elizabeth at windsor palace 
no date was set for the visit the first by a british monarch 
since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 czar nicholas ii who was 
killed with his family by the communists was a cousin of the 
queens grandfather 
gorbachev and his wife raisa spent 40 hours in britain before 
flying home and ending a sixday journey that also took them to 
ireland and cuba 
in londons guildhall the 1000yearold seat of city 
government gorbachev rubbed shoulders with robed bewigged 
notables marched behind the ceremonial macebearer and generally 
seemed to enjoy his encounter with traditional british pageantry 
then with mrs thatcher seated before him he delivered an 
unusually brief 27minute speech 
he said the soviet union would halt production this year of 
weaponsgrade uranium and will shut down two more reactors that 
produce plutonium for nuclear weapons by the end of next year 
he called it another major step toward the complete cessation 
of production of fissionable materials for use in weapons 
later friday soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov refused to say at a briefing which reactors would be 
closed or give their locations 
the defense department official who refused to be further 
identified said they the soviets have weapons material coming 
out of medium and shortrange missiles there has been as 
assessment that they have stockpiles of weaponsgrade materials 
if the soviets shut down weapons reactors for several years 
they could restart them later when the military begins to run low 
of weapons material 
gorbachevs statement did not provide adequate information for 
pentagon analysts to assess what impact the steps would have on 
producing plutunium and tritium the two materials needed for 
modern thermonuclear weapons gorbachev did not mention tritium 
it was one of several recent pronouncements by gorbachev about 
arms reduction in december he announced to the united nations the 
soviet union soon would begin reducing its standing army by 500000 
men and withdrawing troops and tanks from europe and the chinese 
frontier 
he praised britain for unilaterally discarding chemical weapons 
and said his country recently completed a facility which british 
experts would be invited to inspect for destroying its own stocks 
the hitherto secret soviet defense budget will be published he 
said 
reviewing his plan to reform soviet society gorbachev 
acknowledged he initially had not realized the magnitude of the 
task 
in an apparent attempt to reassure westerners who fear a 
conservative backlash he said there is no turning back for 
anyone the people have firmly linked their destiny with 
perestroika 
gorbachev got a standing ovation and a resounding endorsement by 
mrs thatcher we want you to succeed in your task she said in 
her reply and promised to help in practical ways too where our 
help is sought and desired 
at a news conference later the prime minister said she found 
gorbachev as dynamic determined stimulating and confident as 
ever 
she has met him five times three of them on visits he has made 
to britain 
recalling the first encounter when he came to britain in 1984 
as no 2 man in the kremlin she said some years ago i think i 
said i thought mr gorbachev was a man i could do business with i 
might just repeat today that i think that he is a person with whom 
i look forward to doing more business 
both sides acknowledged the talks were tough argumentative and 
yielded little practical progress but the visit was a public 
relations triumph for gorbachev 
after the speech he walked into admiring crowds for the second 
time on the trip and his televised appearance with the queen 
guaranteed him new prestige with the royaltyloving british public 
the 63yearold monarch in a bright pink cape and skirt led 
the gorbachevs around windsor castle a royal residence for 800 
years before lunch with her husband prince philip her son 
edward mrs thatcher and 33 other guests 
gorbachev later arrived home in moscow the official tass news 
agency reported friday night without giving details

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday all 
palestinians will be able to run in elections he proposes for the 
occupied lands and any agreed solution will not be occupation 
his statements in an israel television interview from washington 
seemed to be conciliatory deviation from earlier positions 
providing an opening for participation of plo supporters in the 
elections 
shamir proposes elections that would choose palestinians to 
negotiate an interim autonomy plan for the west bank and gaza 
where palestinians have been in revolt against israeli occupation 
for 16 months talks on a permanent solution would begin after five 
years 
the prime minister consistently has ruled out a role in the 
elections for the palestine liberation organization with which 
israel refuses to deal and expressed hope of finding palestinian 
negotiators not affiliated with it 
i believe the plo does not want peace and therefore any 
joint effort would be wasted and would not achiece the aim he 
said in the interview friday 
plo chairman yasser arafat called shamirs election proposal 
inappropriate as usual and said the uprising will continue 
until victory it was not clear from his comments whether he he 
opposed the concept of elections in the territories 
shamir said he believed the 17 million palestinians in the west 
bank and gaza would agree to elections even if the plo did not 
support them and indicated plo supporters would be able to run 
clearly we think any palestinian resident of judea samaria 
and gaza can participate he said using biblical names for the 
west bank 
if we reach an agreed solution it would not be possible to 
call it occupation in any case it will not be occupation 
asked whether a member of the radical plo faction democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine could participate he avoided 
a direct answer 
look we have to work out all the details he said what i 
brought are mostly principles general pictures that must be filled 
with lines spots this we will have to do in the near future 
i think we have to start in the next few days shamir said 
he appeared to back off from his earlier insistence that the 
uprising end before elections were arranged linking such a truce 
instead to the actual time of voting 
its selfunderstood that when we approach the elections when 
we start this process it cant be conducted and accompanied by 
riots disturbances and attacks he said i would not mention 
conditions but this is understood if we have partners for 
implementation of that program its certainly a realistic program 
it can be carried out and i think it serves the interests of both 
sides it greatly satisfies the aspirations of the palestinian 
arabs without harming israels security and principles 
of his talks with president bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii shamir said the americans did not ask him to trade 
territory for peace 
they did not ask me to accept this formula he said they 
know my views and i adhere to the formula that says were obliged 
to hold talks in which the future of territories will be 
determined 
negotiations on final disposition of the territories israel 
captured in the 1967 war must be held without preconditions 
without determining what the solution might be shamir said 
only one thing it must be accepted by both sides

the bush administration said friday it is 
searching the world for experts with oilspill experience to help 
in the alaska oil cleanup and also plans to recruit a work force 
of young volunteers to help scrub petroleumstained beaches 
those steps were outlined by us officials after president bush 
first pledged military troops and equipment as part of an increase 
in the governments role in repairing and containing damage from 
the nations worst oil spill 
were at fullscale said transportation secretary samuel s 
skinner who is overseeing the expanded federal effort this is a 
major civilian disaster it is being treated as such by the 
president 
skinner said the youth corps might be mobilized later this 
springto help clean up oilfouled coastlines and wildlife on the 
dozens of islands affected by the 101 million gallons of crude oil 
that spilled from the tanker exxon valdez 
meanwhile interior secretary manuel lujan said his department 
is preparing a memorandum of understanding with exxon for an 
initial payment by the giant oil company at least 10 million to 
cover the costs of assessing longterm environmental damages and to 
plan for their mitigation 
lujan said the final total for cleanup and environmental 
recovery is likely to be well in excess of the 100 million talked 
about several days ago the area thats covered keeps growing and 
growing said lujan in an interview 
i dont think well be through with all this business of 
cleanup in anything less than a year he warned 
right now we cant really tell you the extent of the damage to 
the wildlife we know that its extensive but as time goes on we 
think its going to be disastrous said lujan 
the head of the environomental protection agency william 
reilly said that one of my first jobs is going to be to bring to 
bear on this problem a group of scientists 
we are looking around the world for the very best scientific 
resources that are available people who have dealt with 
significant oil spills before reilly said 
reilly said it is still too early to assess the full damage from 
the oil spill he predicted the epas study of the damage could 
itself take as long as three years to complete 
other elements of the administrations alaska relief plan 
include 
a yettobe determined number of troops will be sent to alaska 
to help in the cleanup a preliminary pentagon assessment team to 
determine the scope of the work headed for valdez on friday 
the defense department will send amphibious ships into remote 
reaches of prince william sound to house and feed those involved in 
the cleanup the valdez airport will be modernized so that flights 
can land there around the clock 
exxon was urged by the white house to increase the number of 
its employees working on the cleanup and was asked to set up a 
procedure for providing immediate payments to those suffering 
damage from the spill pending the resolution of permanent claims 
the administration announced bush would soon submit oilspill 
liability legislation to congress and he also called on the senate 
to give prompt attention to ratifying several pending international 
oilspill agreements 
defense secretary dick cheney said nearly all branches of the 
military will be involved in the massive cleanup 
weve got the capacity i think to go in and help solve that 
problem he said he compared the decision to send troops to 
alaska to the use of military forces last year in fighting forest 
fires in yellowstone national park 
at the pentagon defense department officials said they had 
postponed a decision on how many servicemen might be sent to alaska 
until the special assessment team reports back with a 
recommendation 
the military said in a prepared statement that the team was made 
up of engineering environmental medical and logistics specialists 
the pentagon also said it was establishing an alaska oil spill 
joint task force to be headed by lt gen thomas g mcinerney of 
the air force the commanding general of the alaskan air command

mikhail s gorbachev followed in the 
footsteps of the czars and came to queen elizabeth iis castle on 
friday then asked the question britons have been speculating about 
for months 
he asked the monarch if she would come to moscow prime minister 
margaret thatcher said the queen gave a very definite yes 
winding up his twoday visit the soviet leader sampled 
oldfashioned british pageantry first in the oakpaneled splendor 
of the guildhall for 800 years the seat of london city government 
then in majestic windsor castle overlooking the river thames 
elizabeth will be the first british monarch to visit the soviet 
union since the revolution that ousted the czars and brought the 
communists to power 
the invitation has great implications because of the close 
kinship of the russian and british royal families czar nicholas 
ii a cousin of the queens grandfather was murdered with his 
family in 1918 ending the romanov dynasty 
the queens reaction sounded somewhat guarded a buckingham 
palace statement said thanking mr gorbachev her majesty 
explained that the program for her visits were fixed a number of 
years in advance she hoped it would be possible to visit the 
soviet union in due course 
but mrs thatcher whose government has the final word on 
approving or rejecting a visit said its a very definite yes 
she added the queen was very positive very glad very happy 
about the invitation 
in november a month before gorbachev originally was scheduled 
to visit britain reports of a soviet prospective invitation to the 
queen started circulating and mrs thatcher let it be known she 
thought it was too soon to give such a resounding stamp of approval 
to the soviet leaders reform plans 
at a news conference in london friday night soviet officials 
were asked whether the palace or british government had insisted 
the soviets apologize for the treatment of the russian royal family 
before the queen accepted the invitation 
yevgeny primakov of the soviet institute of world economic and 
international politics said there were no preconditions on either 
side 
he said soviets are reasessing their history but added this 
is not the point this is an invitation to a head of state of a 
country with which we are trying to find points of convergence 
gorbachev was driven to windsor castle 21 miles west of london 
the first soviet leader since 1967 to visit the queen 
in drizzling rain he took the royal salute from the guard of 
honor mounted by the 1st battalion coldstream guards the captain 
then reported to gorbachev in russian and the soviet leader 
carrying his hat in his hand reviewed the troops clad in gray 
greatcoats and bearskin hats 
the queen wearing a pink cape and matching skirt then took 
gorbachev and his wife raisa on a quick tour of the palace past 
relics from the crusades medieval knights on horseback king henry 
viiis suit of armor and a painting of the russian emperor 
alexander i gorbachev beamed in recognition 
the party made a brief detour to enable gorbachev to look at a 
malachite vase given to queen victoria by czar nicholas i 
nicholas i was the first of the czarist cousins to come to 
windsor spending three days in june 1844 as victorias guest 
alexander ii the future alexander iii and the future nicholas ii 
were also entertained at windsor by the british royals 
buckingham palace said gorbachev invited the queen to visit the 
soviet union over a lunch of smoked salmon pastry filled with 
layers of beef duck puree and artichoke and avocado salad and 
three wines 
the 34 guests included mrs thatcher and her husband denis and 
the queens youngest son prince edward who will be visiting 
moscow next week with the national youth theater 
lord st john of fawsley a constitutional expert said the 
invitation will cement the very warm relationship between 
ourselves and the soviet union i think it will put an end to all 
tensions that could have come from the memories of the 
assassination of the czar and i think the queen will have a very 
ecstatic reception 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage 
said the queen should insist that the soviets disclose where czar 
nicolas ii and his family are buried and that she be allowed to 
pay her respects 
the fact that the queen could see the graves of her relations 
and repair the damage done after the russian revolution in a 
christian and religious way would perhaps bring these countries 
closer together than anyone ever thought possible he said

cbs will create a fourhour miniseries based on 
the life of hedda nussbaum who testified against former lover joel 
steinberg when he was tried for the death of their foster daughter 
a spokeswoman said friday 
writing and casting have not begun but cbs which competed with 
abc and nbc for exclusive rights to the story plans to broadcast 
the miniseries sometime next season said ann morfogen vice 
president of media relations 
ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens book editor has pledged 
her full cooperation including the diaries she began writing at 
age 15 but will not have editorial control of the project 
the series will likely concentrate on ms nussbaums 
relationship with steinberg who was convicted of firstdegree 
manslaughter in the fatal 1987 beating of 6yearold lisa the 
couples illegally adopted daughter 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer was sentenced to 
8to25years in prison two weeks ago and is appealing his 
conviction 
ms nussbaum a patient at a psychiatric center recounted years 
of physical and psychological torture during her testimony 
andrew lack executive producer of cbs news west 57th 
arranged the deal with ms nussbaums lawyer barry scheck 
a network official who would not be quoted by name said ms 
nussbaum will receive well under 100000 lack said the money 
will go toward her staggering medical bills 
steinberg lawyer felix gilroy told the daily news the fact 
that the production exists and that it came out so quickly after 
the sentencing just demonstrates that there was a monetary motive 
behind her whole fabrication if she told the truth it wouldnt be 
a story 
nussbaum has refused to give interviews since she was arrested 
with steinberg in lisas death charges against her were dropped

a sharp earthquake jolted southern 
california from downtown los angeles to san diego on friday 
causing minor injuries and damage in orange county where the 
shaking was strongest 
mirrors windows and wine bottles smashed to floors at fashion 
island shopping center the largest outdoor mall in orange county 
said anita hilyer administrative director she said shoppers 
scrambled when the 46magnitude temblor hit 
some of them panicked and got in their cars and tried to get 
out of here she said some went to the center of the mall to 
wait and see and what would happen next 
several people were injured by broken glass at rjs the rib 
joint restaurant in affluent newport beach a city 40 miles 
southeast of los angeles said police spokesman bob oakley 
we felt a real slight rolling motion then a real abrupt 
shake it felt as if something crashed into the building it was 
that sharp oakley said a lot of alarms are going off in the 
city we had to bring in extra personnel in the communications 
center to handle hundreds of calls 
the earthquake at 107 pm measured 46 on the richter scale 
and was centered directly under newport beach according to the 
us geological survey and the california institute of technology 
in pasadena 
usgs spokeswoman pat jorgenson in menlo park said the epicenter 
was very near that of the march 10 1933 long beach earthquake 
which measured 63 on the richter scale killed 115 people and 
spurred reform of californias school construction laws 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a 75 reading reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than a 65 reading 
at the san onofre nuclear power facility in northern san diego 
county the quake prompted officials to declare an unusual 
event the lowestlevel emergency declaration said southern 
california edison spokeswoman becky sordelet however the one 
nuclear reactor that was operating was not shut down 
nancy aldon of newport beach said the quake toppled books 
dishes and videotapes off shelves in her home 
the whole building shook a kind of rolling shake said 
kimberly stewart 25 who works in a law office in a 15floor 
office building in huntington beach which is adjacent to newport 
beach 
it startled everyone she said it was slight then got 
stronger and slight again we are on the 11th floor so im sure it 
seemed a lot stronger 
it was like being stopped at a stop sign and being run into 
a resident of irvine in orange county told knxam radio 
at a california newspaper publishers association seminar and 
luncheon at the grand hotel near disneyland in anaheim those in 
attendance felt a jolt and then shaking that gradually gathered 
strength chandeliers began to dance and glasses rattled on tables 
andrea schulte a 23yearold student who was at the meeting 
said the quake started with very little noise everybody stayed 
calm nobody moved except one person because she was under a 
chandelier the building was moving and the chandeliers were 
swaying 
but in newport beach resident joseph cleary said it was a 
large jolt a big jump 
in long beach 22 miles northwest of the epicenter the quake 
was felt in high rise apartments and employees at los angeles city 
hall and downtown los angeles courts also felt the temblor 
at a hearing in superior court in downtown los angeles judge 
bruce geernaert was in the midst of delivering comments on the fear 
of death suffered by rock hudsons lover marc christian then the 
room began to sway 
is it my decision or are we shaking asked the judge 
as the swaying continued a voice from the back of the room 
called out this is a fear of death your honor and everyone 
laughed 
the judge noted for the record there has been and maybe still 
is a bit of an earthquake in progress but he continued with the 
hearing 
a quake at 35 on the richter scale quake can cause slight 
damage in its immediate area a 4 can cause moderate damage and a 
5 considerable damage a 7 is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

spacecrafts engines and cargo 
shuttle technicians planned to spend the weekend hooking up 
turbopumps in atlantis three main engines 
we should be all buttoned up and ready to check the engines 
for flight by monday said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
nasa wants atlantis to lift off on april 28 but concedes the 
schedule is tight shuttle managers are to meet april 14 to set a 
firm launch date 
a test of the computer and communications link between nasas 
ground control station and the shuttles 378 million cargo the 
magellan venus probe and its booster rocket was scheduled for 
saturday 
after a 466day trip magellan will orbit venus with a 
highpowered radar pointed at the planets surface over 243 days

president bush told congress friday he was 
releasing a 120 million installment to keep the mx missile program 
alive but still has not made up his mind on how to modernize the 
nations landbased nuclear missiles 
he said the money had to be earmarked to prevent program 
disruption for the 10warhead mx 
the administration is undertaking a review of what mix of 
nextgeneration missiles to endorse 
the mx missiles would be deployed in rail cars a rival plan is 
to switch to singlewarhead midgetman missiles or there could be 
some mix of the two intercontinental ballistic missile systems 
bush was initially to tell congress by midfebruary which system 
he had selected however that deadline was missed and the 
selection which has been debated for the past ten years 
postponed while the review of us strategic policy proceeded 
i am committed to an open and full review of the icbm 
modernization issue i am confident the review will provide the 
basis for development of consensus on icbm modernization bush 
said in a letter to the chairmen of the senate and house committees 
on appropriations and armed services 
bush said permitting 120 million to be spent on the mx program 
would ensure its viability while not endangering the midgetman 
program which can proceed without additional funds until the 
national security strategy review and amendments to the fiscal year 
199091 budget are completed 
this obligation of additional funds for the mx must occur in 
order to prevent program disruption substantial cost increases or 
significant schedule delays bush said 
bush said during last years presidential campaign the real 
choice now is to find a possible mix between the two 
a congressional study last year said that it would cost 138 
billion to build 50 railbased mx missiles and about three times 
as much for the equivalent 500 midgetman missiles 
mx proponents cite this cost advantage while opponents argue 
that the 10warhead mx would be more vulnerable to surprise attacks

supplied by the soviet union have now made it possible to prepare 
an overall assessment of health conditions in the 33 countries 
the population of the countries totals about 12 billion about 
one fourth of the world total 
according to the survey the chances of dying from cancer in the 
developed nations are 1 in 6 and almost 500000 annual deaths 
below age 65 are related to cigarette smoking

the government friday moved to abolish labor 
regulations that guarantee dockworkers jobs for life prompting 
strikes by thousands of employees at five big british ports 
including liverpool and tilbury 
one union leader warned abolition of 42yearold national dock 
labor scheme may provoke a nationwide strike 
the leftistled transport and general workers union which 
called the walkout urged its members to return to work ahead of a 
meeting scheduled monday to discuss whether to hold a ballot on an 
official strike 
in the house of commons prime minister margaret thatchers 
government put forward legislation to scrap the regulations by 
july they apply to 9400 dockworkers at 46 ports handling 70 
percent of britains foreign trade 
the government plans to pay compensation of up to 59500 to 
each of the 1000 dockworkers expected to lose their jobs when the 
system is abolished 
the legislation welcomed by employers is certain to be passed 
because of mrs thatchers big majority in the commons 
on thursday employment secretary norman fowler called the dock 
labor regulations an anachronism amid jeers from opposition 
labor party legislators 
as long as the scheme continues to operate it will remain the 
biggest obstacle to a modern and efficient ports industry said 
fowler 
more than 2200 dockworkers at liverpool in northwestern 
england and the east coast port of tilbury two of britains 
biggest ports walked out after mass meetings friday another 
english port southampton was at a standstill and smaller 
walkouts disrupted bristol the scottish port of glasgow 
the labor party accused the government of an act of wilful 
sabotage 
the dock labor regulations introduced by a labor government 
stipulate that manning levels can be cut only when workers quit 
voluntarily if a port goes out of business dockworkers covered by 
the system must be hired at another port 
the regulations were introduced to stop harsh employment 
conditions when dockers were hired on a daytoday basis competed 
with each other for work and had no job benefits but critics say 
abuses have grown and some dockworkers get paid not to work 
john connally docks officer at the transport and general 
workers union said a strike could spread 
the docks membership of the union will undoubtedly react 
strongly and will call for the implementation of the 
longstanding policy to call a national strike to oppose any 
attempt to end the scheme he said 
britains other newer 29 main ports employing another 4000 
dockworkers are not covered by the scheme but connally said he 
believed they would also walk off the job if a national strike was 
called 
national docks strikes in 1972 and 1975 hit large parts of the 
british economy

homicide rates doubled in the united states and 
canada within 20 years of the spread of television says a 
psychiatrists sevenyear statistical study which he contends shows 
a link between video and violence 
other experts cautioned friday however that while dr brandon 
centerwalls study may have merit blaming television for the rise 
in homicide rates is too simplistic 
centerwalls study published in the april issue of the american 
journal of epidemiology is billed as the first to look at the 
statistical relationships between exposure to television and acts 
of violence for the entire country 
centerwalls study also suggests that as many as half of other 
violent crimes including rapes and assaults are related to 
exposure to television 
television is a factor in approximately 10000 homicides each 
year in the united states said centerwall a member of the 
psychiatry faculty at the university of washington school of 
medicine 
while television clearly is not the sole cause of violence in 
our society and there are many other contributing factors 
hypothetically if television did not exist there would be 10000 
fewer homicides a year 
to arrive at this conclusion centerwall studied the white 
population of south africa where television was not introduced 
until 1975 using statistics from 1945 to 1974 he compared 
homicide rates among south african whites to the rates among us 
whites and the entire canadian population 
he found that homicides remained roughly flat in south africa 
before television was introduced in the united states and canada 
however homicide rates doubled within 20 years after the 
widespread introduction of television 
centerwall also said the homicide rate among south african 
whites in 1983 the last year for which statistics were available 
was 56 percent higher than in 1974 indicating a trend similar to 
what occurred in the united states after the introduction of 
television 
ronald kessler a professor of sociology at the university of 
michigan said friday that the major problem with centerwalls 
study is that when television arrives in a society many other 
things come with it 
its hard to imagine when you look at whats been happening 
in south africa that the main change between the 1950s and 1970s 
has been television he said in a telephone interview 
dr michael rothenberg professor emeritus of psychiatry 
behavioral sciences and pediatrics at the university of washington 
said he believed centerwalls study should be taken very very 
seriously 
rothenberg coauthor of the current edition of dr spocks 
baby and child care added that people who commit homicide do so 
for many different reasons and centerwalls figures struck him as 
high 
he compared entire populations so the statistical study is 
more accurate rothenberg said but precisely because they are 
entire populations there are multiple variables 
centerwall said regions of the united states that had widespread 
television before the rest of the country also saw earlier 
increases in homicide rates 
there is a strong relationship between when a region acquired 
television and when its homicide rates went up he said 
south africa was an appropriate choice for the study because it 
is a prosperous industrialized western country similar in many 
respects to the united states centerwall said he limited his 
study to south african whites because south african blacks and 
other minorities live under very different conditions 
centerwalls study did not look at which aspects of television 
presumably lead to violent behavior he said other variables such 
as the amount of time spent watching tv the kinds of programs 
watched and what else the television viewer does in a day still 
need to be studied

journalist marjorie nichols walked out of a 
building on parliament hill on friday afternoon and heard to her 
astonishment a member of parliament shouting at her look out 
youre in the line of fire 
moments before she had gazed out from the center block and saw 
people leaving a bus 
sort of walking running in a crouched position she told 
reporters later people were escorting them in a crouched 
position like you see in war movies 
when she walked out of the building she saw men lying prone on 
the ground men in street clothes with guns drawn 
and then bill blaikie a burly member of parliament from 
winnipeg was yelling at her to get out of there before she was hit 
by a bullet 
it was no movie 
a gunman had hostages in a bus on the parliament hill lawn and 
shots already had been fired 
nicholas a columnist for the ottawa citizen and the 
politicians staff and visitors in the gothic parliament buildings 
were in a combat zone 
it was one of those things where somebody shouts there have 
been shots and i thought my god i heard that 
her reaction was common among the people working in the 
parliament buildings who were soon told of the hostagetaking 
outside 
many had taken no notice of the shots they heard 
i heard a gunshot and that made me look out said a 
receptionist in the office of sen stanley haidasz you know you 
hear all the noise all the time and you dont pay much attention 
but it sounded peculiar 
the receptionist refused to give her name 
police hurried visitors and some employees out of the building 
they told many employees not to leave the parliament buildings and 
to stay away from windows as the area was being cordoned off 
one of our security men just came in and asked us to leave and 
he said because he has fired another shot weve got to get out 
of here said terry kealey a staff member in grains minister 
charlie mayers office in a phone interview 
about two hours later the employees were ushered out by 
security guards 
those in the main building were led through a tunnel to a nearby 
building then escorted out amid the hundreds of spectators who had 
gathered on nearby sidewalks 
parliament members sitting in the commons were informed by the 
sergeantatarms about the gunman they left when the building was 
cleared 
blaikie a new democrat member of parliament said he was 
standing on the front step of the parliament buildings waiting for 
a cab when he noticed a police cruiser drive across the lawn 
moments later officers motioned to people to get down blaikie 
said and he decided maybe it was time to get out of there

an exxon tanker carrying 13 million gallons 
of petroleum products ran aground friday near the mouth of the 
mississippi river but the hull was not damaged and none of the 
cargo spilled the coast guard said 
the 617foot exxon wilmington was freed after seven hours and 
resumed its journey to new jersey officials said 
thank goodness for something called mississippi mud said 
john reidy a spokesman for exxon 
the ship ran aground at 830 am about three miles downstream 
from a russian grain freighter that has been stuck in the channel 
for 18 days said coast guard chief dan dewell 
some build up and settlement may have occurred in that area as 
a result of changes in the current where the grain ship is reidy 
said 
dewell said the tanker hit soft mud unlike the russian 
freighter which is hard aground and was being unloaded so that it 
can be floated free 
the exxon ship ran aground in the same place that a second 
freighter was mired last week dewell said 
this sort of thing happens seven to eight times a year 
especially in the early springtime he said 
four tugs and a barge helped free the wilmington which had 
taken on 8 million gallons of jet fuel and other cargo at the exxon 
refinery at baton rouge reidy said also aboard were about 5 
million gallons of gasoline lubricants and paraffin 
with that kind of cargo its always a concern reidy said 
two weeks ago an exxon tanker ran aground on a reef on the 
southern coast of alaska spilling more than 101 million gallons 
of crude oil it was the largest oil spill in north american 
history

the company so much asked yuichi ichikawa a senior official of 
komeito the clean government party

japan socialist party said i am speechless now i dont think 
he has any other choice but to step down after all these

the 725 million in punitive damages awarded 
to rock hudsons lover in a landmark aids lawsuit is excessive and 
probably will be reduced to 3 million the trial judge said friday 
superior court judge bruce r geernaert said however that he 
generally agreed with jury rulings in favor of marc christian who 
sued hudsons estate because hudson continued to have sex with him 
without revealing he had aids 
geernaert said also he was inclined to reduce the 145 million 
in compensatory damages the jury awarded to christian in addition 
to the 75 million but deferred his decision until april 21 
i have not at this point decided the amount of reduction he 
said the most relevant consideration bearing on my deliberation 
is the fear of aids which is in reality a fear of death and it 
is a fear of a miserable agonizing death 
geernaert said he like the jury believed christians 
assertions during the trial that he lived with that fear after 
hudson his lover for two years told the public he had the 
sexually transmitted disease 
christian 35 who sat in a back row of the courtroom during the 
hearing declined comment outside court but he was smiling as he 
left the courtroom he has tested negative for aids 
the judge criticized posttrial statements by defense lawyers 
that the jurys huge award was a joke and rejected defense 
motions including claims by hudsons estate and secretary mark 
miller of juror misconduct 
jurors decided on feb 15 that hudson was guilty of outrageous 
conduct for not telling his lover he had aids 
hudson 58 the star of such movies as pillow talk and 
giant died oct 5 1985 about three months after the public 
learned of his disease christian said that was the first he knew 
of his lovers affliction and he testified i thought i was a 
dead man 
the jury found that miller conspired with hudson to keep the 
aids diagnosis from christian so the younger man would continue to 
engage in sex with hudson 
in his decision on punitive damages the judge said this 
assessment against miller alone was intended to punish as well as 
to set an example for others he said he felt the 3 million figure 
would serve that purpose 
he gave attorneys until april 14 to submit further papers on the 
compensatory damage issue and said he would issue his final written 
ruling on april 21

authorities have arrested a miami 
man accusing him of running clandestine radio and television 
broadcasts with the help of the us government and local 
opposition leaders 
attorney general carlos villalaz said kurt frederick muse 39 
was arrested wednesday night as he tried to leave panama and return 
to miami 
villalaz told a late night thurday news conference muse is 
accused of secret broadcast transmissions and attempts to violate 
national security 
muse was briefly presented to reporters and told them he was not 
beaten during his detention 
the attorney general said muse operated seven different 
broadcast stations each in a different building within the 
capital authorities found a radio station at each location and 
television stations at two he said 
villalaz showed reporters a video cassette seized at one 
location reportedly containing a news program by panamanian 
broadcaster bosco vallarino now a resident of washington dc 
vallarino is a director of the opposition group civilian crusade 
and is sought by authorities in connection with the case the 
attorney general said 
he said arrests were expected shortly of panamanians involved in 
the case 
villalaz said us army officials stationed at clayton base near 
the panama canal deposited 3000 a month in muses personal bank 
account in the united states to pay for the pretaped broadcast 
service 
according to documents found on his person muse reportedly 
worked for the us army in panama as a civilian school inspector 
he added 
panamanian officials said they knew about the broadcasts for 
three months but the sophisticated equipment used made it 
difficult to pinpoint the signals origins 
the broadcasts reportedly appeared under the name libertad 
and had no fixed transmission time announcement fliers were 
distributed an hour before transmissions 
the broadcasts were transmitted automatically with a special 
timing mechanism so no one had to run the equipment officials 
said electronic equipment designed to interrupt regular tv and 
radio transmissions was used to deliver the broadcasts to 
panamanians 
a communique from the defense forces press office said muse was 
involved with the american embassy the secret service and the 
interamerican development agency and formed part of a strategic 
plan of the americans in association with local opposition 
sectors executed during the past few months 
in a separate apparently unrelated case authorities on 
thursday freed panamanian businessman luis alberto arias formerly 
the federal budget planning secretary and director of the national 
bank a day after his arrest for undisclosed reasons 
sources in the opposition democratic christian party told the 
associated press that arias was arrested wednesday night at the 
airport as he tried to board a usbound plane 
no official statement has been made on arias arrest or release 
and arias could not be located for comment 
the governmentbacked news media repeatedly attacked arias in 
recent months accusing him of giving the us government 
panamanian bank records 
the united states last year froze 54 million in panamanian bank 
assests deposited with us banks as part of economic sanctions 
designed to force out gen manuel antonio noriega chief of the 
defense forces and panamas de facto leader 
washington acted after a federal grand jury in florida indicted 
noriega on drug trafficking charges noreiga denied the charges

white house and congressional budget talks 
recessed friday missing their informal deadline for action but 
house majority leader thomas s foley said the group was in the 
proximity of an agreement 
the group which includes treasury secretary nicholas brady 
white house budget director richard darman and the top members of 
the house and senate budget committees had been pushing to finish 
by friday because of congress legislative timetable 
under the grammrudman law congress is supposed to finish a 
fiscal 1990 budget resolution by april 15 house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif had said he needed to finish the 
bargaining with the white house by friday so that his committee 
could complete a formal resolution next week 
the congressional and white house negotiators planned to 
reconvene monday and a meeting with bush was scheduled for tuesday 
were getting in the proximity of an agreement i cant give 
you a time or an hour said foley dwash after fridays 
allday bargaining session 
several people involved in the talks said privately the hope 
was to announce an agreement at the white house on tuesday but 
foley was cautious 
i would not automatically draw the conclusion that it the 
white house meeting is a special meeting he said 
were making good progress but were not there yet said 
sen pete v domenici rnm senior republican on the senate 
budget committee 
the negotiations are designed to ensure that congress budget 
resolution meets grammrudmans goal of reducing the deficit to 
100 billion and that legislation produced to implement the budget 
could pass muster with president bush 
according to bush administration estimates about 28 billion in 
deficit reduction either new revenues or spending restraints 
must be made to reach the goal 
the negotiators have been looking to make the package about half 
revenues and half spending with the revenues coming in the form of 
asset sales user fees and changes in tax law that bush does not 
consider as violating his no new taxes pledge 
it is unlikely that any agreement produced in the current talks 
would include specific tax proposals or many specific spending 
reductions instead the group was working on a broad outline 
leaving details to be worked out later between the administration 
and the committees in congress with jurisdiction over individual 
areas

the justice and health and human services 
departments said friday they are reviewing a number of instances in 
which authorities believe medicare paid medical bills for which 
private insurance carriers were liable 
the justice departments civil division which recently filed 
lawsuits against two private insurance companies to recover money 
the government alleges should not have been paid by medicare is 
continuing to review a number of cases submitted by the health and 
human services department said spokeswoman amy brown 
earlier this week the department filed suit against provident 
life amp accident insurance co claiming between 7 million and 223 
million it contends the company should have paid instead of 
medicare 
last month the department sued blue cross and blue shield of 
michigan claiming they should have paid at least 2 million in 
medical and hospital costs that were billed to medicare 
the overpayment issue stems from an overlap in coverage between 
medicare and private health plans for elderly people who continue 
to work 
under the law medicare is only liable for those charges that 
are not covered by the elderly employees private health plan 
dennis siebert a spokesman for the health care financing 
administration which runs the medicare program said in most cases 
the agency is reimbursed by private insurance companies when it 
tries to recover charges that should not have been assessed to 
medicare 
in some cases where we have not been able to resolve the 
situation with the responsible insurance company we dont have any 
recourse but to seek those legal means to get it back siebert 
said 
these cases are referred to the hhs inspector general or to the 
justice department 
judy holtz a spokeswoman for the inspector generals office 
said friday evening that the department has a task force on the 
matter combining people from her office auditors and 
investigators as well as personnel from the social security 
administration and the hcfa 
in the past week the office issued a subpoena against empire 
blue cross and blue shield of new york to obtain their records she 
said adding that the office has more than a halfdozen 
investigations under way at this time 
the wall street journal reported friday that its investigation 
of six years of hcfa records showed the agency failed to correct 
the problem of overbilling the journal said the amount may be as 
much as 10 billion over the period 
i dont think anybody has an exact number of how much money is 
involved in these cases in fact how many cases are involved 
siebert said 
the lawsuit filed here in federal court accuses provident 
which is based in chattanooga tenn of failing to tell medicare 
that it had a primary obligation to pay patients medical bills 
instead the company directed its claims adjustors in 1983 to 
await whatever action medicare took first the lawsuit said 
if medicare paid the bulk of the patients bills provident then 
paid only secondary benefits even if the company had responsibility 
to pay the main charges the suit says 
the lawsuit does not accuse the company of engaging in fraud 
provident which denies any impropriety has filed a countersuit 
in federal court in chattanooga charging that the medicare program 
was poorly administered

doctors said friday they are implanting test 
tube embryos in surrogate mothers to help women who cannot bear 
children but they raised ethical questions about doing it for 
women who want babies without pregnancy 
the issue was raised at a conference on in vitro or test tube 
fertilization attended by doctors from 42 nations another issue 
was the morality of paying surrogates 
surrogate parenting is a wonderful option for couples who 
cant have children any other way who have nowhere else to turn 
said william handel a lawyer from the center for surrogate 
parenting in beverly hills calif 
the center charges 15000 to arrange contracts between couples 
and surrogate mothers however the medical costs of in vitro 
fertilization could raise the total cost to 40000 according to 
the center which has been involved in 11 such pregnancies 
more than 800 infants have been produced worldwide through 
surrogacy usually the surrogate mothers eggs are used 
in the in vitro procedure however an embryo is produced in a 
test tube using the egg of a woman with a uterine defect then 
implanted in the womb of the surrogate 
dr wulf h utian a member of the cleveland team that produced 
the worlds first test tube baby using a surrogate in 1985 said 
the procedure raises numerous ethical issues 
he cited questions over whether doctors should involve 
themselves in contracting surrogates whether the surrogate should 
be paid whether a surrogate should have a relationship with the 
child she bears and who should be considered the babys legal 
parents 
you cannot embark on a program of this nature without giving 
serious thought to these issues said utian of clevelands mt 
sinai medical center is it ethical for example for a hollywood 
actress to hire a surrogate so as not to have to take time out from 
her career 
utian said his team has sidestepped the thornier ethical 
questions by dealing only with women who are infertile due to an 
absent or nonfunctioning uterus because of a hysterectomy or a 
congenital defect 
women in the cleveland program provide their own surrogates and 
doctors are not involved in handling any financial arrangements in 
the past 18 months the team has achieved five pregnancies after 
implanting embryos in 25 surrogates utian said 
a program in perth australia uses only surrogates who are 
close relatives preferably sisters of women who are unable to 
carry a child because of uterine defects said dr jl yovich of 
the pivet medical center 
the surrogates are not paid yovich said the clinic has achieved 
two pregnancies since last year 
dr zev rosenwaks of the cornell medical center in new york said 
24 clinics in 10 countries including the united states and 
australia work with donated eggs 
the technique involves fertilizing the donor eggs with sperm 
from an infertile womans husband any resulting embryos are then 
implanted in the womans uterus 
he said that in about 55 percent of the cases eggs are provided 
by relatives of the infertile woman the rest come from anonymous 
donors or from test tube patients who have produced excess eggs as 
a result of hormone treatment

unions opened negotiations friday with the 
prospective new owners of eastern airlines on multimilliondollar 
concessions that buyers led by peter v ueberroth say are vital to 
closing the deal to purchase the strikebound carrier 
before agreeing to any concessions however union officials 
want guarantees the former baseball commissioner and his partners 
have a viable plan for running the airline and no plans to sell any 
more of easterns assets 
this will take some time because its not only money 
involved said an international association of machinists 
official who asked not to be identified how does our ownership 
part shape up how do we get our passengers back what kind of job 
security is involved 
nevertheless there was cautious optimism heading into the 
talks which began friday at iam headquarters and were expected to 
continue through the weekend 
were negotiating which is a lot different than it was a day 
ago said the iam official thats progress 
meanwhile texas air corp charged in a lawsuit filed in fort 
bend county district court near houston that twa chairman carl 
icahn and twa were trying to interfere with the planned sale to the 
ueberroth group 
houstonbased texas air parent of continental airlines and 
eastern claims that icahn a takeover specialist has illegally 
communicated and negotiated with union groups representing 
employees of eastern offering inducements to those groups to deal 
with icahn and twa rather than the ueberroththomas talbot 
group 
texas air said in a statement that by negatively influencing 
discussions with the unions and the ueberrothtalbot group mr 
icahn can hope to frustrate efforts to get eastern flying again and 
make a more favorable deal for himself 
the delay confusion and economic damage that eastern would 
suffer could obviously provide the opportunity for mr icahn to buy 
assets at bargain basement prices the statement said 
icahn could not be reached for comment friday 
iam spokesman jim conley said the unions would have no statement 
on the ueberroth negotiations because both sides in the talks had 
agreed to a news blackout requested by the bankruptcy judge 
overseeing eastern 
reaching agreements with the three unions remains a major hurdle 
to completion of the 464 million purchase and ueberroth can call 
off the deal if new contracts are not reached by tuesday night 
ueberroth also would need approval from a bankruptcy court in new 
york 
ueberroth met informally with union leaders thursday night after 
the sale agreement was announced but was not involved in fridays 
negotiations ueberroth considered a tough negotiator as head of 
the 1984 olympics in los angeles and as baseball commissioner was 
expected to join the talks at some point 
representatives of the air line pilots association and the 
transport workers union which represents eastern flight 
attendants also were involved 
by midafternoon the negotiations involved few specifics 
according to sources who declined to be identified one of whom 
described the session as highly preliminary to more substantive 
talks expected to continue throughout the weekend 
ueberroth has said he will sell easterns northeast shuttle 
service to developer donald trump and as part of his purchase 
agreement with texas air corp gave the parent company landing 
slots and a gate at new yorks laguardia airport as well as a new 
yorkmontreal route 
the union leaders wary those decisions will make it harder for 
eastern to return to profitability are seeking assurances 
ueberroth plans no further asset sales 
the iam struck eastern a month ago because it refused to accept 
concessions demanded by texas air corp the pilots and flight 
attendants have honored iam picket lines 
ueberroth according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity wants 210 million in wage and benefit concessions 
wally haber general chairman of the machinists district 100 in 
miami said 210 million is the total amount of concessions 
requested earlier by texas air 150 million of that from 
machinists he said he did not know if ueberroth had adopted the 
texas air demands 
haber said machinists were willing to accept 15 percent wage and 
benefit concessions 
union officials have indicated a willingness to accept 
concessions provided eastern was sold to a new owner also 
ueberroths agreements give employees a 30 percent ownership stake 
in return for concessions 
a spokesman for the flight attendants union however noted that 
its members made major wage concessions in their last contract 
three years ago and were wary of further losses 
more concessions are really not something that were really 
looking forward to said twu spokesman jim gannon right now 
theres really not much more to give 
eastern has been flying about 110 flights a day during the 
strike eastern spokesman jim ashlock said the sale agreement 
caused no noticeable increase in passenger loads friday 
haber said his miami office across the street from eastern 
headquarters has received calls from local union leaders asking if 
members should return to work 
until we sign on the dotted line we are still on strike he

a federal judge friday overrode us 
immigration officials and ordered a dutch visitor suffering from 
aids released from prison so he can attend a conference on the 
disease 
immigration judge robert vinikoor said hans paul verhoef had met 
standards required to allow him to be excluded from laws barring 
foreigners with dangerous and communicable diseases from entering 
the country 
i believe he has shown a waiver of exclusion should be 
granted vinikoor said while i dont want to minimize the risk 
of aids the applicant has shown there is a minimal risk to the 
united states if he is admitted on a temporary basis 
us immigration and naturalization service officials 
immediately asked the federal board of immigration appeals in falls 
church va to stay the judges order but friday night the board 
refused to consider the request said thomas schiltgen ins 
district director in st paul 
verhoef boarded a flight for san francisco at 725 pm friday 
at the minneapolisst paul international airport the fiveday 
conference in the california city ends sunday 
good verhoef exclaimed after hearing the judge issue the 
order in the courtroom where he was handed a bouquet of pink roses 
by supporters later verhoef spoke to reporters at the airport 
im very glad that i can do what i have to do now that the 
us government has let me go he said 
im very disappointed being imprisoned and getting this 
treatment in this country he said adding that he was disturbed 
about having to raise 10000 bond before leaving minnesota 
judge vinikoor ordered verhoef to post a 10000 bond to enforce 
the terms of the waiver which is in effect until april 28 the 
money was provided by supporters of the minnesota aids project 
within a few hours of the judges ruling said helene haapala one 
of verhoefs lawyers 
vinikoors decision overrode the ins action earlier in the day 
the ins denied verhoefs request for a waiver to attend the aids 
conference 
the risk of harm by an aidsinfected alien in the absence of 
humanitarian reasons for the temporary admission of aliens far 
outweighs the privilege of an alien to enter the united states to 
participate in a conference richard norton associate 
commissioner for examinations wrote in the ins ruling 
at the hearing before vinikoor verhoef stopped short of saying 
he wouldnt engage in any sexual act while in the united states he 
promised only to practice safe sex 
im prepared to say under oath that i will abstain from risky 
behavior verhoef said under questioning from richard soli ins 
district counsel 
is safe sex 100 percent safe soli asked 
in my knowledge yes verhoef replied 
verhoef described alternatives to intercourse including hugs 
sexual caresses and special toys he said he brought toys that 
could be used without a partner 
i think everyone all of the persons who have aids or who have 
tested positive for hiv should be aware of the fact that they 
shouldnt take any steps in spreading the virus he said 
i have got aids myself and i realize very well what it is to 
have aids i dont want to do that to anyone else he said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
verhoef was detained by immigration officials on sunday at the 
minneapolisst paul international airport as he was traveling to 
the conference in san francisco he had been held at the oak park 
heights state prison 
the judge said immigration officials acted properly in 
apprehending verhoef but he said congress allows discretion in 
interpreting the law 
his ruling echoed thursdays recommendation by ins district 
officials in st paul who had said verhoef should be allowed to 
attend the conference the us immigration officials opposite 
stance drew fire from dr tim wolfred executive director of the 
san francisco aids foundation 
the ins has decided to enforce a law founded on hatred 
bigotry and ignorance he said this decision says the federal 
government has no compassion for people with hiv disease or 
understanding of how aids is transmitted

a record heat wave throttled southern 
california for a fourth day friday as nurses tried to keep patients 
cool in a hospital without air conditioning and anyone who could 
get away fled to the beach 
the mercury hit 100 degrees in downtown los angeles at 1 pm 
smashing the april 7 record of 88 set in 1904 downtown had a 
recordtying 100 tuesday and record highs of 105 wednesday and 106 
thursday 
other afternoon readings included 109 in palm springs 101 in 
burbank and ontario 102 in san bernardino 93 in san diego and 
80s and 90s statewide including san francisco and the san joaquin 
valley 
an earthquake measuring 46 on the richter scale hit southern 
california about 1 pm but the crowd on huntington state beach was 
unmoved it was kind of like were out on the beach youve had 
an earthquake dont bother us said lifeguard patrick zuniga 
one of the most serious problems posed by the heat wave caused 
by inland high pressure holding off ocean breezes was lack of air 
conditioning in the huge ucla medical center where a thursday 
night fire knocked out the cooling system no injuries were 
reported and no patients had to be moved because of the fire 
the hospital shut its emergency room canceled surgery and 
turned off hot lights fans were brought in and nurses gave baths 
to keep the 462 patients in the 711bed hospital cool an inside 
thermometer read 86 degrees at 1030 am friday said spokesman 
rich elbaum 
the cooling system was repaired enough to work at 50 percent 
capacity by 11 am and was expected to bring patient wards down to 
72 degrees by early saturday at the latest said spokeswoman vicki 
beck 
there were no major problems with patient care during the air 
conditioning outage ms beck said the emergency room reopened 
at 3 pm and surgeries were expected to be on schedule saturday 
thousands flocked to the coast to seek relief from the 
sweltering inland temperatures to swim in water that ranged from 61 
to 64 degrees but could only be reached after a trek across 
blistering sand 
lifeguard randy degregori watching over some of the 60000 
people crowded near the water on santa monica beach figured the 
sand was 10 or 15 degrees hotter than the air people should wear 
shoes he advised 
its beautiful said lifeguard steve voorhees at the south 
end of santa monica bay the only damper on the thing is the smog 
down here 
a smog alert was forecast saturday in los angeles and east to 
the san gabriel and pomona valleys and the riverside and san 
bernardino areas the air quality management district predicted 
very unhealthful air in those areas after a week of record heat 
elsewhere the sierra nevada beckoned weekenders with daytime 
highs in the 40s and 50s 
the weather is absolutely gorgeous said gary shultz 
general manager of the mammoth lakes resort association the 
snowpack is still over 6 feet on the mountain and skiing is great 
the national weather service predicted the beginning of a 
cooling trend saturday with the dissipation of the santa ana 
weather condition which began with warm wind last weekend

south africa said friday it will use 
all the force needed to crush an incursion by black nationalist 
guerrillas and the territorial administrator said unsponsored 
elections set for november may not be held 
louis pienaar installed by south africa said there is a de 
facto suspension of the un idependence plan which also calls 
for combatants to be confined and it has become impossible to 
contemplate such elections under the prevailing circumstances 
rf botha the south african foreign minister said he had 
informed un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar of the 
decision to activate more soldiers but he did not specify the 
number 
he said a major reason was that some guerrillas of the 
southwest africa peoples organization were approaching areas 
where white farmers live 
in new york the un security council held private consultations 
on the crisis friday the council president soviet ambassador 
aleksandr m belonogov said later that after reading bothas 
letter the council is satisfied that south africa is committed to 
granting independence to namibia 
newspapers in harare zimbabwe said the six frontline 
states ofered the un peacekeeping force up to 6000 soldiers to 
help stop the fighting 1000 each from angola botswana 
mozambique tanzania zambia and zimbabwe 
they said the decision was made thursday at an emergency summit 
in luanda angola 
south africas military said it ordered out warplanes for the 
first time friday and reported swapo had brought its first tanks 
across the border from angola spokesman col japie dreyer said 
four jet fighters fired on swapo positions thursday killing 17 
guerrillas 
botha flew to windhoek for emergency talks saturday with 
officials from the united nations cuba and angola senior us and 
soviet diplomats will observe 
the fiercest fighting seen in the 23year confrontation raged 
across northern namibia on friday a week after a unsupervised 
truce was to end the war 
at least 261 swapo guerrillas and 28 security force members have 
been killed since saturday south african police officials said 
on thursday swapo said 38 guerrillas died and nine were 
missing the guerrilla organization charges many of those killed by 
security forces are civilians 
south africa says swapo has sent more than 1900 guerrillas into 
northern namibia this week in violation of an accord requiring the 
insurgents remain at bases in angola at least 100 miles from its 
border with namibia 
the united nations has allowed south africa to deploy up to six 
units of troops to support paramilitary police but botha said 
friday the security forces at the present level are not able to 
stem the incursion 
anton lubowski one of swapos few white officials told a 
windhoek news conference the head of the un operation in namibia 
finlands martti ahtisaari should be replaced immediately 
they un officials are coming with exactly the same 
arguments as south africa that the guerrillas must be disarmed 
lubowski said it is clear they are working with the south 
africans and are in the south africans pocket 
botha said of ahtisaari hes in an awful position it was 
never his task to handle a violation of un resolution 435 
the un task is to observe patrol and prevent border 
infiltration of a very limited nature botha said 
the united nations authorized 4650 troops for namibia but has 
been criticized because less than 1000 have arrived 
un spokesman francois giuliani said military observers will 
begin pouring into namibia during the weekend 
an 850member contingent of finnish observers will be airlifted 
by the us military saturday to monday and other arrangements are 
being made to fly in 850 malaysian and 850 kenyan troopers he said 
un officials say the independence plan made no provision for 
swapo bases in namibia even angolas president jose eduardo dos 
santos whose country has hosted the guerrillas since 1966 
criticized swapo 
i regret the swapo leadership was not able to exercise total 
control over its guerrillas at the critical moment of the start of 
resolution 435 by stopping anyone crossing the angolannamibian 
frontier dos santos said thursday 
swapo leaders contend most of the guerrillas had been in namibia 
for some time and have no intention of accepting a surrender offer 
south africa says will expire saturday a un report blames the 
guerrillas for a major incursion according to british prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
several captured guerrillas have said they returned to namibia 
in search of un personnel and expected no confrontations with 
security forces

a man who claimed to possess taped conversations 
of tawana brawleys advisers expressing doubts about her tale of 
gangrape by whites was acquitted friday of perjury and obstructing 
justice 
a us district court jury found samuel mcclease innocent on the 
third day of deliberations in the weeklong trial 
mcclease 27 of newark nj added another twist to the 
tangled brawley case last june when he told federal investigators 
and news reporters that he had bugged the conversations of ms 
brawleys advisers and could produce tapes undermining her story 
ms brawley a black teenager from the upstate community of 
wappingers falls ny claimed she had been abducted and raped by 
up to six white men including one with a police badge in 
november 1987 
on the advice of her lawyers and family adviser ms brawley 
who was then 15 refused to cooperate with the grand jury 
investigating her case creating national headlines 
mcclease a selfdescribed surveillance expert claimed to have 
tapes demonstrating that ms brawleys advisers the rev al 
sharpton and attorneys c vernon mason and alton h maddox jr 
did not themselves believe her story of abduction and sexual abuse 
all the brawley advisers denied mccleases allegations and the 
10 tapes mcclease later produced for a federal grand jury turned 
out to be blank 
last november after a sevenmonth investigation a state grand 
jury did not indict anyone and issued a report that concluded ms 
brawley concocted her story a month later a federal grand jury 
indicted mcclease on one count each of perjury and obstruction of 
justice 
mcclease heaved a sigh of relief as the verdict was read and 
later told reporters im happy right now i want to put this 
behind me and get back into electronics legally

world trade talks hit a snag friday when european 
nations made an unexpected proposal in negotiations on textile 
trading officials said 
negotiators at the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
meeting settled differences between the european economic community 
and the united states on agricultural imports 
the 12nation eec however unexpectedly offered a new textiles 
proposal of a substantial nature said gatt spokesman david 
woods 
woods said arthur dunkel gatt directorgeneral was angry 
at the development 
but tran vanthinh head of the eec delegation said that much 
employment and investment was at stake 
we have the right and the duty to make any proposal right up 
to the last minute of the negotiations he said without 
elaborating on the eecs plan 
developing countries with large textile industries want liberal 
regulations industrialized countries such as the united states and 
eec members are concerned about the impact a lack of restrictions 
might have on domestic industries 
woods said discussions would continue through the night and that 
dunkel would try to present a final proposal on all issues for 
approval on saturday 
an agreement would automatically include 11 other world trade 
accords reached at a gatt meeting in december in montreal it also 
would clear the way for more progress in the socalled uruguay 
round of tradefreeing negotiations due to end 1990 
negotiations on agricultural imports were stalled by a us 
demand that supports be eliminated the eec had resisted the idea 
the agreement reached friday calls for an overall freeze on farm 
supports and import barriers through 1990 it calls for countries 
to reduce their subsidies in 1990 but does not specify by how much 
us officials were not available for comment on the accord

here are excerpts of testimony friday by 
oliver north in the irancontra trial as he was questioned by 
defense attorney brendan sullivan 
sullivan colonel north yesterday when we concluded we had 
focused on the fact that there were four ways that you and the 
administration assisted the freedom fighters during the time period 
you spoke about now id like to address your attention to the 
period in the summer of 1985 theres been testimony about letters 
received at the national security council directed to mr robert 
mcfarlane from congressman michael barnes dmd and congressman 
lee hamilton dind would you tell the jury what was the 
relationship that was existing between the congress and the 
administration at that time 
north by the summer of 1985 what had been a long political 
warfare between the opponents of the presidents policy and the 
administration was i guess made worse by the fact that the 
congress voted to approve humanitarian assistance the 
administration countered with accusations of leaks and that 
congress would leak things before they ever happened and people 
alleging that congress had a unilateral veto a one man veto over 
any kind of covert action or anything else particularly focused on 
the central america problem and so that even though the congress 
had voted to approve some aid of a nonmilitary nature the opponents 
to the administration became even louder in their opposition to the 
resistance 
sullivan now congressman barnes was he a strong opponent 
of aid to the freedom fighters 
north yes sir he was congressman barnes was at that time 
the chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee of the house 
foreign affairs committee and that was the subcommittee that 
voted on all of the foreign aid for the countries in latin america 
sullivan now congressman hamilton what was his position 
in relation to the support for the freedom fighters 
north congressman hamilton chairman of the house intelligence 
committee was not as vocal as was congressman barnes but he 
was opposed to military aid to the resistance and he was a strong 
opponent 
sullivan so both congressmen both of whom were against support 
for the freedom fighters both of whom testified here in court sent 
letters in august 1985 
north yes sir 
sullivan now colonel there came a time when you talked to mr 
mcfarlane about how the national security council should respond to 
these inquiries 
north mr mcfarlane and i had a conversation and that 
discussion focused along the lines of my saying we shouldnt be 
answering this that this kind of information is what is properly 
the prerogative of the white house and the president and we ought 
to invoke what is called executive privilege we dont have to 
answer this north read the letter from rep hamilton 
inquiring about reported actions taken by the nsc to support the 
activities of the contras despite legislative prohibitions under 
the boland amendment 
sullivan so how did you tell mr mcfarlane how to respond to 
congressman hamiltons request 
north what i urged that he do is that he go back and simply say 
were not going to respond to this that the activities of the nsc 
is not a matter for congressional intrusion 
sullivan what did mr mcfarlane respond to that 
north he said well give me a stab or give me a try at 
answering this letter 
sullivan now when you drafted this for mcfarlane what was 
your intention 
north well my intention was to continue to try not to give a 
response 
sullivan and mcfarlane took two paragraphs which are the 
ending paragraphs of your draft 
north yes sir 
sullivan and the rest of the letter was something that he wrote 
north yes sir having been told several times that my 
approach on this issue was too confrontational he didnt want 
to hear any more from me about it i took this note along with 
his draft and went over and made a final memo to go out with 
the substantive lengthy answer on this matter 
sullivan why 
north because the answer that he wanted to give was wrong it 
was not accurate it was factually incorrect 
sullivan and tell the jury again what answer did you want to 
give 
north i wanted to give an answer my preference right from the 
start was to give an answer that would have read something to the 
effect mr hamilton this is the purview of the presidency the 
constitution has a separation of powers and the congress and the 
presidency are two coequal branches of government and we dont have 
to answer those questions

the opposition branded as insufficient 
a electoral reforms package introduced in the national assembly on 
friday by the leftist sandinista government 
the bill includes proposed reforms in elections and mass media 
as part of a regional peace accord reached at a central american 
summit meeting on feb 14 
the reforms are to ensure fair general elections which 
president daniel ortega moved up by 10 months to feb 25 1990 
this is a joke said sergio torres a deputy from the 
conservative democratic party which with 14 deputies has the 
largest opposition representation in the 96member assembly the 
governing sandinista national liberation front has 61 deputies 
torres complained about a government proposal to allow 
nicaraguans abroad to register for voting at nicaraguan consulates 
but require they vote in nicaragua 
i was under the impression that any consulate is considered 
part of the national territory torres told reporters 
mauricio diaz leader of the popular social christian party 
said the proposed 30 minutes allowed daily to political parties in 
staterun television and radio stations was not enough 
now that theyre proposing that anything with 27 members can 
call itself a party obtaining air time will be very difficult 
diaz said 
he also said allowing members of the armed forces to vote goes 
against opposition demands 
this package is not what the opposition has demanded 
virgilio godoy head of the conservative democratic party told the 
associated press later 
he called the proposals an attempt to make it seem the 
sandinistas are serious about democratization 
this package is not directed at nicaragua its not for 
internal consumption godoy said ortega just wants to carry 
that package in his pocket when he goes to europe 
the president is leaving on an eightcountry european tour april 
25 to lobby for money and political support for nicaragua 
at the february summit in el salvador ortega promised reforms 
to ensure free and fair balloting along with moving up the 
elections under the accord reforms must be in place by april 25 
the five presidents of nicaragua el salvador honduras 
guatemala and costa rica also agreed to draft a plan by midmay 
to dismantle the nicaraguan rebel force known as contras 
about 11000 contras and their relatives have lived in honduran 
jungle camps in honduras since their leaders and the sandinistas 
signed a ceasefire in march 1988 a month after the us congress 
cut off military aid to the rebels 
the government reform package on friday was sent to committee 
for subsequent assembly debate

president bush called out the military 
friday to help clean up the exxon valdez spill as forecasts of 
shifting wind and high tides raised fears the oil might be blown 
back into the fragile fjords of alaskas central coast 
as the cleanup entered its third exasperating week state 
officials said they had worked out an agreement between exxon and 
the coast guard by modifying their request for a complete coast 
guard takeover 
exxon will handle contracts and purchases and the coast guard 
will direct field activity said dennis kelso commissioner of the 
department of environmental conservation 
its a resolution of what we thought was a real logjam 
kelso said 
so far only an estimated 16000 barrels about 7 percent of the 
101 million gallons spilled when the tanker exxon valdez hit a 
reef has been sopped and vacuumed up from the once clear water of 
prince william sound by friday the crude oil had floated over a 
3000squaremile area 
the good friday spill has killed thousands of birds and sea 
otters along the central alaskan coast and fishermen have lost 
millions of dollars 
bush said he directed defense secretary dick cheney to make 
military forces and equipment available and transportation 
secretary samuel skinner to coordinate the federal effort 
bush had been under pressure from members of congress and 
alaskan officials to intervene alaska gov steve cowper on 
wednesday asked the coast guard to take over management of the 
cleanup from exxon 
the president insisted however we are not federalizing this 
operation and that this should not relieve exxon from any of 
its responsibilities or liabilities 
kelso said the military is welcome to pitch in moving equipment 
but that there was no need now to line the shore with soldiers 
more people will be needed for shoreline cleanup but that is 
not what the proper focus should be right now he said we 
dont intend to change our momentum at all we dont know how long 
it military mobilization will take but were not going to sit 
back and wait 
cowper said he was pleased with bushs action although hed 
prefer available alaskans work the cleanup before the military 
it appears the president is meeting the objectives we had in 
asking the coast guard to take over the spill cleanup in prince 
william sound the governor said 
interviewed late friday rear adm edward nelson the coast 
guards top official in alaska said he would use some military 
personnel in liaison and staff positions but were not going to 
bring in a lot of troops certainly not now 
nelson also said the command of the cleanup has been 
straightened out 
i never felt they exxon were unresponsive or 
irresponsible nelson said i think we had the problem with 
organization thats what frustrated everybody we now see a clean 
line of whats going to go on 
exxon has flown in 35 million pounds of equipment and hired 
1000 cleanup workers about 160000 feet of oil containment boom 
and 29 skimmers are in prince william sound and an additional 
120000 feet of boom and 32 skimmers are en route said exxon 
shipping co president frank iarossi 
if you think about the challenge weve had here we were told 
our most important objective was to defend the four fisheries and 
weve been successful i guess victory is in the eyes of the 
beholder iarossi said all the equipment has been deployed and 
is working very well 
he said exxon will pay for a public relations campaign by 
seafood processers saying alaska seafood is still wholesome 
northerly wind has helped push the oil offshore but the 
national weather service said a shift in the wind was possible over 
the weekend weather service regional chief scientist gary hufford 
said southeasterly wind blowing at 20 mph is expected for a few 
days 
if we have southeasterly winds hundreds of more miles will be 
impacted from kenai peninsula to kodiak island said jim hayden 
coordinator of the states cleanup effort 
a possible storm along with anticipated high tides of 15 feet 
would present a double jeopardy to the efforts to contain and 
remove the oil 
weve been blessed with reasonable weather said hufford 
but that luck is changing 
at kenai fjords national park a remote refuge 100 miles 
southwest of valdez workers began setting up floating oil booms as 
a sheen of oil washed toward the small inlets and fjords of the 
coastline park 
we have our teams ready and were trying to prepare for the 
eventuality of a storm said ron smith a department of interior 
spokesman for a joint statefederal cleanup effort 
prince william sound fishermen who have been using oil booms 
and a ragtag fleet of loaned equipment to protect vital salmon 
fisheries warn the storm and tides could push the oil over their 
barriers and kill millions of salmon fry 
were emphasizing the need to recover the oil kelso said 
every barrel of oil that comes out of the water is a barrel of 
oil that is not doing further damage to the sound

a document produced in oliver norths trial 
sheds new light on george bushs role in the irancontra affair 
showing that he helped the reagan administration effort to support 
the nicaraguan contras despite a ban on us aid 
the document read to the irancontra jury by norths defense 
attorneys placed bush at a may 1985 meeting in honduras with 
thenpresident roberto suazo it says bush informed suazo of 
president reagans decision to speed us military and economic aid 
to the country 
what set up the bush meeting were behindthescenes discussions 
among north and other us officials on a plan to seek assistance 
from other countries to tide over the nicaraguan rebels at a time 
when direct or indirect american assistance was outlawed by 
congress 
a preface to the document said the united states has admitted 
for purposes of this trial the following facts to be true and it 
went to lengths to stitch together how the secret covert support 
program worked 
in effect the reagan program established a quid pro quo 
relationship basing us assistance to honduras and some other 
countries at least in part on those countries willingness to help 
sustain the contra fighting force

the sap from maple trees is running so

the past has come alive in hungary 
where people are striding into a future they hope will spell 
democracy 
they sit on park benches reading about imre nagy the hitherto 
disgraced leader of the 1956 antisoviet uprising that was crushed 
by soviet tanks three new books on nagy sell rapidly at stores and 
street stalls 
an old coat of arms abolished by the communists in 1948 has 
become a symbol of national pride parliament has joined the 
discussion on possibly restoring it as the national emblem 
the wave of nostalgia peaked march 15 when an estimated 100000 
people turned out to mark the anniversary of a failed revolt in 
1848 against austrian hapsburg rule 
it became clear then that the preoccupation with the past has 
everything to do with the future 
the aims of both the 1848 and 1956 revolts and reforms today are 
the same constitutional democracy and national independence 
miklos tamasgaspar one of the leaders of the many new independent 
political groups told the crowd 
hungarians are well aware of their past failures in trying now 
to achieve those goals diplomats call it a healthy pessimism 
but others fear the dash for reform could end in disaster 
they speculate about armed action by the military or oldguard 
communists who have also organized their own groups in recent 
months and despite the new leeway from moscow they are still 
mindful of the bloodshed that ended reform in 1956 
the cart cant go backwards but it can overturn the 
reformist politburo member reszoe nyers said in a recent radio 
interview 
even hungarians most active in creating the change cannot 
explain how it happened so fast and hesitate to predict how it will 
continue 
yet both the communist leadership and the founders of 
independent movements recognize they can only achieve lasting 
change by working together 
with the memory of 1956 still sharp both sides are wary of each 
other both have much to lose the communists their power and the 
independent groups their chance to bring change 
but hungarians know the new climate in moscow means the time for 
change is now or never as a banner at the march 15 rally said 
on recent visits to the kremlin communist party leader karoly 
grosz and premier miklos nemeth came home with what they said was 
an ok from president mikhail s gorbachev to go ahead with reform 
including political pluralism 
the first test will be the 1990 parliamentary elections whose 
form is still unclear 
in some respects the march 15 rally was the start of 
campaigning for those elections the independent groups showed they 
have become a force drawing far larger crowds than those at a 
communist rally 
there seems to be vague agreement on all sides however that 
completely free elections will not be possible by 1990 and that 
some provisional arrangement should be made to get the independents 
into parliament so they can help lay the groundwork for completely 
open elections in 1995 
for the independents it is essential to maintain unity both 
within their own ranks and against the communists 
unity is most important in the face of the monolithic power 
which is still in place said rudolf joo a leading member of the 
hungarian democratic forum one of the most influential and broadly 
based groups 
ferenc koeszeg a leading member of the league of free 
democrats says it is important for the independent groups to work 
out a common position before negotiating with the communists who 
opened tentative talks with each group in february 
another problem for the independents with their largely 
intellectual base in budapest is to attract support from workers 
who are increasingly unhappy with price increases and 
governmentimposed austerity measures 
the communists have published their own action program 
committing themselves to a multiparty system free elections and 
representational democracy 
the communist party is playing a role as if it were one of the 
independent groups said the free democrats koeszeg with 
the action program they are trying to occupy the place of an 
opposition group 
communist leaders say they would in fact be willing to go into 
opposition but emphasize they are confident of at least 51 percent 
of the vote in the elections 
the partys confidence stems from its 40 years of political 
experience and control of the media while the independent groups 
are just getting started 
in a oneparty system the party has a monopoly of peoples 
thinking and even their souls said sandor csoori a poet and a 
forum leader

this is a land where the kings 
take turns and have no coronations because they wear no crowns but 
when the latest in the monarchal rotation kisses a dagger with a 
wavy blade april 26 he will become the yang dipertuan agung the 
one who is chief among the most prominent 
the ninth agung since the countrys independence from britain in 
1957 he will keep his throne until 1994 then turn it over to an 
elected successor neither the public nor parliament has a vote 
the privilege rests only on the heads of malaysias nine royal 
houses 
one of them is chosen by secret ballot of his fellow monarchs 
for a fiveyear reign as king of kings for this southeast asian 
federation of 17 million people when his term is up he returns to 
his home state where his throne has been kept warm in his absence 
by his eldest son 
nine of malaysias 13 states have a hereditary ruler the others 
have to make do with a governor named by the agung acting on the 
the advice of the prime minister 
the agung is azlan muhibbuddin shah 60 the sultan of perak 
who was elected march 2 he is a lawyer and career civil servant 
who was lord president of the supreme court in 198284 he left the 
judiciary to succeed his late father in 1985 as head of the perak 
royal household 
though not as wealthy as most of the other rulers sultan azlan 
is widely regarded as the best educated he attended the 
thenprestigious government english school where the sons of royal 
and welltodo malays were groomed for government service in 
colonial days from there he went to the university of nottingham 
and lincolns inn both in britain and was called to the english 
bar in 1954 
the rotating throne solved a sticky protocol problem when 
malaysia then known as malaya shed its colonial ties with britain 
in 1957 since no one of the state rulers would have been accepted 
by the rest as permanent head of state thenprime minister tunku 
abdul rahman devised the unique system of giving every state with a 
ruler a turn on the throne 
years later in retirement the tunku himself a prince of the 
royal house of kedah said the agung was vested with all the 
powers such as those given to soverigns of great britain and other 
democratic monarchies of the world as symbolic head of state 
the agung never interferes with the actual running of the 
government 
political power rests in a britishstyle national parliament and 
state legislatures which are elected every five years 
in eight years in office the current prime minister mohamad 
mahathir has had uneven relations with the royal houses his 
government tried in 1983 to abolish the kings veto over 
legislation 
the rulers resisted and mahathir took his case to the country 
with a series of public rallies a compromise was reached in which 
mahathir agreed that the agung could delay legislation and send it 
back to parliament for review but if it passed again it would 
become law a practice similar to the way the house of lords 
operates with the house of commons in britains parliament 
seven states call their hereditary rulers sultans perlis makes 
do with a rajah and negri sembilan refers to its ruler as yang 
dipertuan besar one who is chief of state 
the state rulers provide a continuing focus for malay identity 
in a country in which malays account for about half of the 
population which also includes sizable chinese and indian 
minorities sultans function as important arbiters of malay custom 
and religion 
some royals are criticized for their love of big cars large 
palaces frequent trips abroad and and aloofness toward their 
subjects they are paid the equivalent of about 23440 a month 
but most nurture their subjects fulfilling the traditional role of 
benevolent leader 
only the ninemember council of rulers can oust an agung by 
majority vote agungs are bound by the constitution to act at all 
times on the advice of the cabinet 
an agung can be reelected for a second consecutive term but 
none has been there is a tacit agreement among the rulers that 
once an agungs term is completed he returns to his state palace to 
give someone else a turn 
a deputy king or timbalan agung also is selected which has a 
proved prudent thing to do since three of the eight previous agungs 
died in office

at one point in nbcs new comedy nearly 
departed the ghost of snotty recently deceased british 
professor grant pritchard ponders i wonder if theres smalltalk 
after death 
only in sitcom purgatory where dwelleth nearly departed 
a moderately amusing halfhour it premieres tonight for a 
spring tryout through may 15 
the show is in something of a comedy twilight zone it goes far 
enough that it will no doubt prove distasteful to some viewers yet 
it doesnt have the wicked edge that should be expected of a comedy 
about death especially one starring eric idle former member of 
monty pythons flying circus 
the writers do their best were dead and well just have to 
live with it and idle is delightful but theres not much of 
anywhere to go with this tired easily tasteless premise 
it seems the professor and his wife claire caroline mcwilliams 
of soap were killed in a rock slide on a mountain road how 
they ever hooked up is a mystery along with many of the other plot 
twists shes sweetnatured and charitable hes a testy elitist 
you always look on the dark side of things she says 
soothingly 
death is the dark side of things he complains 
unable to go on to the afterlife for unexplained reasons they 
return to their beloved bookish and wellappointed home in the 
chicago suburbs so grant can be constantly perturbed by its boorish 
new bluecollar residents a plumber named mike dooley stuart 
pankin of not necessarily the news his wife wendy schaal 
and their teenage son jay lambert 
in the pilot grant is at first incensed at being dead but 
begins to adjust when he realizes he is capable of such antics as 
climbing into the shower to gaze undetected at naked mrs dooley 
having grant and claire standing around making comments about 
the unaware dooleys is fun for about a nanosecond so we soon meet 
grampa henderson forsythe who inexplicably can see and hear the 
pritchards but of course hides this from his daughter and 
soninlaw lest they think hes bonkers 
in the weak subplot that drives act 2 it seems grampa has lost 
his drivers license and delivery job and fears he will lose his 
independence if he doesnt get his license renewed claire wants to 
help out of a sense of philanthropy grants assistance is 
motivated by his desire to rid the house of at least one inhabitant 
if pops can drive he can live somewhere else 
then follows a nicely executed but basically freestanding 
sketch a turn on the wellused drivers license bureau scene the 
classic being the taxi episode when jim had to get take the 
written test whats a yellow light mean go slow whats 
a yellow light mean its pretty funny though 
it illustrates the series reliance on idle hilarious as he acts 
out the letters of the eye chart to help gramps pass the test 
check out r 
the final punchline goes thud perhaps a portent of things to 
come ultimately theres not much reason to tune in again to 
nearly departed unless the show goes in a direction that is in 
no way indicated by the premiere future jokes are bound to be 
nothing more than variations on a wellworn theme a half hour of 
nearly departed is just about enough

imagine andrew lloyd webber or stephen sondheim 
not allowing songs from their latest musicals to be recorded or 
played on the radio or performed in nightclubs and cabarets 
jerome kern issued such an edict after the opening of sitting 
pretty his 1924 musical written with guy bolton and pg 
wodehouse 
why the ban 
kern was a man who wanted his music played the way he wrote it 
and not jazzed up or distorted by popular renditions he was a 
perfectionist although some musical comedy historians think the 
prohibition may have been a ploy by kern to create more interest in 
the show 
if it was it didnt work despite generally good reviews the 
musical had a disappointing run of only 95 performances and 
promptly was forgotten eight or nine of its songs were published 
but much of the score disappeared until it was unearthed in a 
secaucus nj warehouse seven years ago 
now sitting pretty returns to new york for five performances 
in a concert version at carnegie recital hall april 13 through 
april 16 it will be conducted by john mcglinn the man behind the 
recent complete and critically praised recording of show boat 
the concerts performed with a 23piece orchestra and an 
18member cast star davis gaines jason graae kim criswell and 
paige ohara 
for mcglinn sitting pretty is a labor of love a chance to 
perform a musical not heard in new york for 65 years 
nobody knows the score at all said mcglinn who considers 
the work an important transition piece a bridge between kerns 
less serious early musicals and his masterpiece show boat 
robert russell bennett who orchestrated many of kerns 
musicals would sometimes refer to sitting pretty in interviews 
saying that it was something that people someday should hear again 
because it was special he said 
mcglinn first heard the music in 1980 when bill tynes of the new 
amsterdam theater company let mcglinn raid his sheet music 
collection 
it was so different and so beautiful and on an emotional 
plane so far removed from many of the other things kern was writing 
at the time he said this score has the deepest emotional 
depth of anything he wrote until show boat 
i dont know what part of himself kern dug down into to create 
this score and i should say wodehouse did as well because the 
lyrics are as moving and emotional as a lot of the music 
the creators didnt get it from the frivolous plot concocted by 
wodehouse and bolton which involves twin orphans who fall in love 
with the real and adopted sons of a wealthy old man 
its extraordinary because there is this wild dichotomy 
between the book and parts of the score which are really emotional 
songs like there isnt one girl a year from today and the 
magic train its the real thing when the music starts playtime 
stops mcglinn said 
i think it comes from the fact that kern by 1924 was ready 
to flex his muscles and when he saw opportunities to write truly 
emotional music he went for it 
sitting pretty remained unperformable until the secaucus 
discovery where a full score for the show as well as a lot of 
kerns working sketches were found 
the carnegie concerts will also include 95 percent of the shows 
dialogue mcglinn discovered a late draft of the script in the 
museum of the city of new york between that script an early copy 
filed at the library of congress in washington and the full scores 
found in secaucus he was able to piece together a book for the 
performers to use 
kern has been a major preoccupation of mcglinns for a long 
time in 1985 he did concert versions at carnegie of kerns oh 
boy oh lady lady and zip goes a million 
besides show boat mcglinn has a recording of kern 
overtures including sitting pretty coming out in may on 
emiangel he also has a complete version of cole porters 
anything goes waiting for release on the same label his other 
upcoming projects include new recordings of porters kiss me 
kate and possibly irving berlins annie get your gun 
for the moment though hes concentrating on kern and the 
concert version of sitting pretty 
musical comedy buffs will savor one number in particular the 
title song it was dropped a week into the musicals original run 
because leading man dwight frye had a minor speech impediment 
when frye sang i like to sit just sit and sit and sit with 
you the whole day through it sounded according to kern 
biographer gerald bordman embarrassingly different mcglinns 
concerts should rescue the song

latenight assaults by teams of masked 
heavily armed bandits may be a hint of the hightech crime of the 
90s the crooks arent after money their target is computer 
chips 
five such robberies at orange county calif firms in six 
months have authorities concerned about a new breed of bandit as 
bold and brazen as jewel thieves yet interested only in the tiny 
components that give computers their smarts 
when you think about the size of the chip and the value the 
loss can be pretty significant to a company a person can walk off 
with a bag of chips that can have more value than diamonds or other 
gems said bruce baker of stanford research institute a think 
tank that keeps tabs on computer crimes 
so far the attacks have been limited to orange county 
authorities in other hightech areas like boston dallas san diego 
and san francisco report no similar thefts though all have had 
employees stealing chips from employers 
yet some authorities fear the hightech crime wave is bound to 
grow 
this is the crime of the 1990s said los angeles county 
deputy district attorney tony castaneda who is prosecuting three 
men for reprogramming 1 chips for use in cellular telephones and 
reselling them for 100 each 
this is hightechnology stuff its the type of crime thats 
going to be prevalent in the 1990s more sophisticated more 
technological 
in the most recent orange county incident four men in dark 
clothing and toting machine guns an assault rifle and a 
45caliber pistol struck advanced logic research at 1030 pm on 
march 3 sticking a gun to a guards head the masked intruders 
demanded entry to the irvine computer firm just days after the firm 
was in the news for developing a new computer 
nothing was stolen in the attack two cleaning women ran 
upstairs and locked themselves in a room and screamed said david 
kirkey vice president of sales and marketing the gunmen ran 
out 
on jan 30 two armed bandits took 105000 worth of dynamic 
randomaccess memory chips from western digital corp after they 
bound a guard drams are the most common kind of computer memory 
chip they store information as an electrical charge and lose it 
when the power supply is turned off 
one week earlier three men wearing combat fatigues and 
brandishing rifles bound and blindfolded two guards at ast 
research police believe the bandits were after chips but they 
only made off with 9000 worth of equipment 
and on nov 24 two robbers armed with revolvers tied up a guard 
at holt inc and escaped with 100000 in computer chips 
although the heists are similar authorities believe two or 
three groups of lookalike bandits are responsible said irvine 
police lt michael white 
ken rosenblatt a santa clara county deputy district attorney 
specializing in hightech crimes said its no surprise the thieves 
are getting bolder 
its a sign of the times people now have better access to 
assault rifles but its a stupid way to steal them its sloppy i 
know of much better ways but im not going to tell you 
rosenblatt said 
the crooks are targeting two kinds of chips those used for 
data processing and those with greater memory as chips become more 
sophisticated with greater capacity in less space they become 
more valuable they also are easier to steal being the approximate 
size of a dime 
a megabyte chip costs about 10 a shopping bag full of 1500 
is worth 15000 thats a lot of money said john king chairman 
of the university of california irvines computer science 
department a megabyte is a million characters 
a new chip with tremendous amount of capacity can be worth 
multithousands of dollars agreed stanfords baker 
what makes the crimes frustrating is that the chips are hard to 
trace they all look about the same and dont have serial numbers 
only a stamped date of manufacture that also leaves legitimate 
businesses open to buying the stolen chips back without their 
knowledge 
if you pulled a person over who had a grocery bag of chips 
you couldnt tell where they got them from said king 
law enforcement and computer experts suggest that the thieves 
could be hired by smaller firms to cripple a competitor the 
average robber trying out a new market or electronics experts who 
will either steal an expensive chips design and sell it cheaper or 
build a cheap imitation 
californias largest chip theft to date was in 1985 larry e 
lowery was sentenced to six years in prison for stealing 32 
million in components from silicon valleys monolithic memories inc 
baker believes the new crimes will continue whenever you have 
a hightech market you have a big market either legitimate or 
black market 
king however says they are a flash in the pan because once 
businesses hear of the thefts they will make their chips harder to 
steal generally they have been stored behind priable mesh doors 
i personally think its a bizarre thing to steal but its 
easier to conceal than an automobile and worth the same king 
said it doesnt have anything traceable on it and the first 
couple of times you do it no one is expecting it no one would 
expect a strongarmed robbery of a computer chip

air and water pollution have 
reached crisis proportions in east germany and western experts say 
pollutants are taking a heavy toll in west germany as far as the 
north sea 
west german officials are considering an offer of money and 
technology to help the east german communist government clean it up 
the water quality of the elbe river is particularly critical 
when it reaches west germany said karl huthmacher a spokesman 
for the west german environmental protection ministry air 
pollution has also reached dangerous levels 
the greenpeace ecological groups west german branch said the 
elbe carries wastes to the north sea where plant and animal life 
are seriously threatened and destroyed 
it also said human health is also increasingly at risk from 
contaminated drinking water 
in leipzig and many east german cities power plants using 
highsulphur brown coal belch out huge clouds of smoke that stings 
the eyes and coats buildings with black soot heavy exhaust fumes 
from cars trucks and buses further foul the air 
western studies indicate that east germany pumps more pollution 
into the atmosphere than any other country in europe including 
nearly 5 million tons a year of sulphur dioxide according to west 
german surveys 
after the oil price rises in the 1970s east germany 
increasingly turned to its considerable brown coal reserves 
statistics on the extent of pollution are not made public in 
east germany but the government is under pressure to release them 
an east german ecological group called the green network arche 
has demanded that the government stop treating evidence of 
environmental pollution as state secrets 
underground ecology newspapers detailing local pollution 
problems are frequently seized 
while east german officials have shown an increased willingless 
to work with west germany on environmental problems western 
experts say they are still a long way from concrete and effective 
measures 
working groups from both sides are still working to come up 
with an acceptable program to help reduce the problems said 
marlene muehe a spokeswoman for the west german environmental 
ministry in bonn 
east german officials said at a recent environmental conference 
in east berlin that a number of new projects had been launched to 
reduce river pollution and that the elbe river would likely be 
cleaned up by 1992 
hans reichelt east germanys minister for environmental 
protection was quoted in the staterun media as saying that all 
new and refitted power plants would be equipped with filtration 
devices beginning next year 
but west german officials say that in order to make any 
substantial progress soon west germany will have to provide the 
east germans with technology and financial assistance 
while east germany was the first eastern european nation to 
enact strict environmental laws the guidelines are rarely 
enforced western officials say 
west german government studies indicate that cleanup tasks will 
be difficult because east germany has largely abandoned 
environmental protection programs in recent years 
the last two fiveyear plans have contained neither a detailed 
environmental program nor funds to carry out projects outlined in 
earlier plans a west german government study said 
because of increasing economic pressures east germany has 
made industrial growth and increased production a priority over 
environmental protection 
west german officials who are grappling with the heavily 
industrialized nations own formidable environmental problems say 
the east german pollution is of grave concern 
our own efforts to correct environmental problems are made 
significantly more difficult because of the east german 
pollutants environmental protection ministry spokesman 
huthmacher said in bonn referring to efforts to clean up the 
nations rivers and to reduce emissions that cause acid rain 
west germanys forests have suffered considerable damage because 
of acid rain 
environmental experts also say east german factories dump tons 
of untreated industrial wastes into waterways where it mixes with 
the runoff from fields treated with nitrate fertilizers 
many major rivers flow into west germany 
according to greenpeace more than 100 tons of waste including 
heavy metals industrial sludge raw sewage and pesticides flow 
into the elbe river each day in east germany

not long ago antony sher was being hailed as one 
of the most exciting shakespearean actors since laurence olivier 
but instead of pursuing greatness on the stage he switched to 
literature and middlepost his rangy and picaresque first 
novel represents the expatriate actors emotional journey back to 
his south african roots 
the book is my comingout as a south african says sher 
ive been a closet south african for a long time what i think is 
healthy is that by writing the book it feels much more comfortable 
being myself 
that self refers to a protean talent by which an outsider has 
managed to crack britains hermetic cultural circle both his 
richard iii and his shylock for the royal shakespeare company were 
revelatory interpretations that placed him at the top of the 
english acting tradition 
sher acknowledges that during his two decades in england he has 
worked very hard to become an englishman acquiring the tone and 
mannerisms of a proper british accent 
middlepost published last september in britain and this 
month in the united states signals his attempt at the age of 39 to 
come to terms with a country that could never fully be left behind 
for the cape townborn grandson of lithuanian immigrants 
it has to do with the huge question mark that hangs over my 
head and i suppose over all the jews of south africa really he 
said in an interview 
at the time of the pogroms at the turn of the century when the 
jewish population evacuated eastern europe to those who went to 
south africa it seemed history was playing a very very cruel joke 
it was inviting them to escape persecution and become the 
persecutor 
shers first years in london were inauspicious rejected by two 
leading drama schools he attended the less prestigious webber 
douglas and did provincial repertory 
not until 1982 and his ensuing affiliation with the rsc did 
the short scruffy actor begin looking like a star for his 19845 
portrayal of the villainous richard iii he hurtled around the 
stage on crutches to capture the essence of shakespeares bottld 
spider 
he played the role for 15 months in stratforduponavon and 
london and took it to australia stopping off in middlepost to 
research the novel 
his richard won him a commercial london run in harvey 
fiersteins torch song trilogy in which he played the 
homosexual drag artist originated by fierstein himself on broadway 
it was the first taste of abovethetitle billing for an actor 
who remembers 20 years ago being wideeyed at this legendary 
place of theater staring at the names in lights there 
back at the rsc he played malvolio in twelfth night vindice 
in cyril tourneurs the revengers tragedy and in the 
merchant of venice a memorable shylock whose full beard and 
thick jewish accent put to rest traditionally dry classical 
english approaches to this difficult part 
sher was already writing middlepost and he acknowledges 
that his commitment to the book may have prompted the rsc to 
sideline him 
i didnt have time to get stuck in so i got left out and i 
was angry he said 
my life seems constantly to surprise me three to four years 
ago if someone had said youd be writing a novel i would have 
said im sorry its not in my plans 
but as soon as he got the idea the theme came very quickly 
it must have been lying there 
set in britishruled south africa in 1902 middlepost is 
about a yiddishspeaking lithuanian immigrant nicknamed smous the 
afrikaans word for peddler 
sher based smous on his grandfather a peddler who peddled his 
way inland and ended up at this place called middlepost the tale 
of smous discovery of self and country unfolds through the 
characters he encounters from the bushgirl naoksa to the arrogant 
afrikaaner breedt 
shers family once owned middlepost a backwater town in the 
karoo desert and the novels theme of alienation in a new land had 
personal resonances 
smous first day in cape town is like a lot of my early days 
in london they were incredibly bewildering although i could speak 
the language 
having come to terms with his south africanness through writing 
sher now finds himself politicized last october he organized a 
benefit in london to raise money for victims of apartheid 
since leaving the stage he has played loki a blacksmiths 
dastardly apprentice in terry jones film erik the viking 
its his second movie following the littleseen 1985 shadey he 
also has written a script for a bbctv telefilm and plans a book 
of his illustrations and a second novel set in presentday england 
and south africa

as investigators hunt reasons for the exxon 
valdez accident the associated press traces blame for the nations 
worst oil spill back to the 1970s when officials began dismantling 
the very plan meant to prevent such a disaster the story reported 
by tad bartimus hal spencer and david foster all in valdez and 
compiled by scott mccartney in anchorage examines the shattered 
promises broken rules and ignored warning signs that played a far 
larger role than a tanker captains nighttime tippling

it takes grandiose vision and engineering 
might to suck oil from the top of the world load it a million 
barrels at a time onto fat oceangoing barges and deliver it to 
american gas tanks 
the same kind of vision lets us turn atoms into electricity 
lets us fling rockets into space and bring them home again 
in time however the miraculous and the dangerous become 
routine we say the worst can never happen but the three mile 
island reactor nears meltdown the space shuttle blows up 
and the exxon valdez runs aground 
the course for doom steered good friday morning by the exxon 
valdez with a liquored captain on board and an uncertified third 
mate in command was charted years before when restrictions were 
relaxed cleanup teams were disbanded and those in charge grew 
overconfident their safeguards were enough 
an examination by the associated press reveals a course charted 
by greed neglect complacency a depressed oil economy and a 
strapped federal budget 
dozens of interviews with former officials and safety officers 
along with a study of state records and original contingency 
proposals indicate that a plan to avert a tanker tragedy was 
develope a decade ago then gradually dismantled piecebypiece 
protections lost in the last 10 years were as basic as keeping 
harbor pilots onboard all the way into the gulf of alaska and 
maintaining staff at the radar screens that keep an eye on tanker 
traffic through prince william sound 
whats more warnings about drunken crewmen made as recently as 
march 2 were ignored failed drills were dismissed and a tanker 
neartragedy was written off as a onetime event 
as investigators seek the causes of the nations worst oil 
spill which has despoiled a lush wildlife habitat perhaps for 
years they will find that decisions made by state and federal 
officials and the oil industry bear far more scrutiny than the 
drinks downed by capt joseph hazelwood officials told the ap 
we all allowed the grenade to be built hazelwood merely 
pulled the pin said randy bayliss the official in charge of 
state enforcement at valdez until 1980 
factors include 
rejection by the coast guard and alyeska pipeline service co 
the consortium of eight oil giants in the prudhoe bay fields of a 
1976 state study that forecast tanker accidents and urged such 
requirements as doublehulled tankers and tugboat escorts beyond 
bligh reef last thursday alyeska began tugboat escorts saying 
a painful lesson had been learned 
two cutbacks in recent years likely removed an extra pair of 
eyes that might have spotted the offcourse valdez in 1978 the 
coast guard reduced the distance local pilots had to guide 
departing tankers and since 1984 the coast guard has cut its 
radar staff in valdez from 60 to 36 reduced the radar wattage and 
decreased the required distance for radar monitoring two operators 
on duty march 24 were not watching the valdez because traffic was 
light and the weather was fair 
disbandment in 1982 of the emergency response team for 
alyeska which has firstresponse duty for spills spillfighting 
equipment on hand was below the minimum required even the barge 
designated to carry containment booms and supplies was in dry dock 
records exxon filed with the state after the accident said 
controlling the valdez spill would have required 500000 gallons of 
chemical dispersant when the tanker hit the reef exxon had only 
3795 gallons and just 110000 six days later 
carelessness by the state agency charged with keeping alyeska 
in compliance the 1986 crash in oil prices forced state budget 
cuts that reduced the work week at the department of environmental 
conservation to four days 
a casual response by alyeska and the coast guard to a 
scientific determination that the columbia glacier would begin a 
drastic retreat in 1980 throwing icebergs into tanker lanes 
alyeska said consequences for tankers would be minimal the coast 
guard promised to take whatever management and monitoring 
measures necessary to ensure safety yet ice caused the valdez to 
alter its course and head directly for bligh reef 
jim whaley a technical specialist and ecologist for the alaska 
pipeline coordinators office from 1974 until 1980 vividly recalls 
the debate over tanker safety during the volatile years of pipeline 
construction and initial operation in the 1970s 
now director of the joint safety center at the us marine corps 
base in kaneohe bay hawaii whaley said in a telephone interview 
with the ap that he never shook off his concerns that prince 
william sound would eventually suffer a major oil spill 
whaley bayliss who was the decs valdez supervisor from 1974 
to 1980 and virgil keith a tanker spill specialist hired as a 
consultant by the state were assigned to study shipping hazards in 
1976 
their computer simulations predicted 20 accidents in 25 years a 
threeweek practice operation in which the 120000ton arco 
fairbanks was run through assorted situations provided little 
reassurance 
when the trials were over all three of us were left with an 
uneasy feeling whaley said our concern was to prevent the 
catastrophe that has occurred but during the trials we got a lot 
of resistance such as oil industry contentions that the studies 
were flawed and that officials were overreacting 
alyeska and the coast guard exerted considerable pressure on 
our requests for the tests to be conducted and about our concerns 
regarding what might happen whaley said 
subsequently the state proposed several safeguards including 
mandatory tug escorts extended radar coverage and doublehulled 
tankers 
i wasnt prepared for such a totally negative response the 
states pipeline coordinator charles champion said at the time 
responding to oil industry criticism that he was asking loaded 
questions champion retorted well those are going to be 
loaded ships

bayliss now a private environmental engineering consultant 
said environmentalists didnt win many battles in the late 1970s 
there were many many safety disputes at that time and in the 
end the state and the environmental community got rolled said 
bayliss 
all of the wonderful safety controls the state and the 
environmentalists wanted fell aside through attrition and constant 
pressure from the oil industry 
other missed warning signs were reports of drinking by tanker 
crews valdez bartenders and townspeople say crews party all the 
time as one woman put it to gov steve cowper when he appeared 
in valdez the day after the spill 
at a meeting with alyeska officials march 2 three weeks before 
the accident valdez residents repeated their concerns about crews 
returning to tankers drunk said sally mcadoo valdez city 
councilor 
we told them we hope that youre paying close attention to 
this we may have a major catastrophe here 
spokeswoman beverly michaels said alyeska was aware of community 
concerns and was doing all it could to monitor crew sobriety a 
security checkpoint stops packaged alcohol at the gate but tanker 
captains are responsible for inebriated crew members 
officials said the erosion of safeguards didnt end with 
measures to prevent accidents but also extended to spill 
preparedness 
from 1979 to 1982 david decker 41 was a foreman for alyeskas 
emergency response team a swat unit for oil spills 
alyeska gradually reduced the original 12man crew decker told 
the ap then in 1982 it eliminated the contracted response team 
completely saying its duties would be handled by alyeska employees 
with other duties 
they were obsessed with saving money decker asserted 
he said his team could circle some ships with containment booms 
in seven minutes but even then we kept reminding them we really 
werent prepared for something big decker said 
their mentality was that nothing big was going to happen 
alyeska believes the personnel changes did not impair its 
ability to repond to a spill said ms michaels although spill 
response is handled by workers with other jobs whatever tasks 
they have can be put aside she said their response is 
immediate 
yet it was 11 hours before the exxon valdez had a boom around 
it and that failed to hold at most alyeska had 20500 feet of 
booms on hand according to state records at least 12000 less 
than what was needed 
jim woodle was coast guard commanding officer at valdez from 
1979 to 1982 when he retired to be alyeskas superintendent of 
marine operations for two years woodle said he witnessed the 
dismantling of what had been a workable plan in 1977 including 
a cleanup contractor who maintained a full inventory of equipment 
and a dedicated team assigned to just oil spill response 
even if fully prepared woodle noted alyeska could not have 
contained this 101milliongallon spill but it could have made a 
substantial dent 
in november 1984 the decs district supervisor in valdez tom 
mccarty attacked alyeskas response in a drill booms sank or 
werent deployed properly he said 
a major spill can occur anytime and alyeskas spill response 
activities have regressed to a dangerous level mccarty wrote 
in september 1985 a memo from dec inspector theresa svancara 
said terminal workers were unfamiliar with spill response equipment 
and didnt know how to do their asigned tasks 
their drills were less than enthusiastic in one a hose to suck 
up spilled oil was not fully deployed because an alyeska supervisor 
said it would be too much work to roll it up again svancaras 
memo said 
dec officials say preparedness has improved since then 
alyeskas oil spill contingency plan for prince william 
sound requires that proper equipment be ready to move immediately 
to a spill and state environmental officials are charged with 
ensuring the plan can be carried out last may however the dec 
missed an alyeska drill dec district chief dan lawn said his 
office wasnt notified until the day before and could not send 
anyone on such short notice 
whaley said that before the pipeline opened in 1977 alyeska 
promised it could airlift within one hour all the oil boom 
transfer pumps and floating bladders necessary to collect oil 
we were assured c130 aircraft from around the nation would be 
arriving into valdez the very first day of the reported oil spill 
that was the plan that the state initially signed off on whaley 
said 
dec commissioner dennis kelso acknowledged he and his 
predecessors had allowed safeguards to erode he blamed budget 
cutbacks and departmental reorganization 
keep in mind that two years ago after oil prices collapsed 
they had my department down to working four days a week kelso 
said 
bayliss said he became convinced jan 17 1980 that what would 
happen on bligh reef nine years later was inevitable 
that day a fully loaded tanker the prince william sound 
lost power in a 60knot gale and 10foot seas and drifted for 28 
miles and 17 hours before restarting engines 
the ship was 40 minutes and 1500 yards from going aground and 
breaking up in front of the columbia glacier in prince william 
sound bayliss said everybody said it could never happen 
again they dodged a bullet that time but this one got them 
just as trust in reliable institutions died with the three mile 
island nuclear accident and the challenger explosion the grounding 
of the exxon valdez has forever shattered the faith alaskans placed 
with the industry that made their state wealthy 
walter j hickel former interior secretary former governor and 
a principal investor in a planned 10 billion natural gas pipeline 
from prudhoe bay to valdez said the oil industry simply misled the 
public 
the public was led to believe facilities were available to 
contain the spill it apparently wasnt true said hickel 
but at the sugar and spice souvenir store in valdez theyre 
selling a tshirt with a big red slash across a pointed finger and 
a simple thought its everybodys fault

it was the kind of calm clear night so 
welcome in prince william sound because it is so rare across the 
bay the lights of valdez twinkled as the mammoth tanker slipped 
from its berth after filling its belly with more than a million 
barrels of alaska pipeline crude 
on the fourthstory bridge of the exxon valdez gleaming white 
superstructure were skipper joseph hazelwood several of his crew 
and ed murphy one of the harbor pilots who routinely guide the big 
ships through the tricky passage from valdez into prince william 
sound 
snow on the steep chugach mountains ringing the harbor cast a 
faint glow in the inky darkness the first hint of what passes for 
spring in alaska definitely was in the air that thursday night 
but before dawn tragic mistakes would change prince william 
sound perhaps forever and send environmental shock waves around 
the globe before dawn the captain would radio a gross 
understatement were leaking oil were going to be here awhile 
i just wanted to make a report before two weeks were out a 
vast often maligned cleanup effort would stagger out of control 
ed murphy clambered over the side of the tanker onto a boat 
headed back to port by all accounts the trip to that point had 
been as uneventful as the thousands of others in nearly 12 years of 
shipping oil out of valdez 
hazelwood contacted the coast guards traffic control center in 
valdez at 1125 pm according to an initial transcript released 
by a coast guard investigator 
we are hooking up sea speed estimated time of arrival at 
naked island 0100 1 am 
roger that sir the coast guard replied not tracking the 
tanker on radar because traffic was so light and conditions were so 
fine request updated ice report when you get down through 
there 
the nearby columbia glacier regularly drops chunks of ice some 
as big as houses that drift into the upper sound and the charted 
shipping lanes 
ok hazelwood replied i was just about to tell you 
judging from our radar we were just about to divert and end up 
in the inbound lane if there is no conflicting traffic 
no reported traffic the coast guard responded 
five minutes later hazelwood radioed he was altering course and 
reducing speed to 12 knots winding my way through the ice he 
advised 
its not clear what happened next hazelwood seems to have set a 
course directly for bligh reef he didnt notify the coast guard of 
the change coast guard investigator mark delozier told the 
anchorage times he left the bridge in command of gregory cousins 
a third mate not certified for those waters 
all was calm until the five final frantic minutes when the crew 
tried to change course and avoid the outcropping of rocks lurking a 
few dozen feet below 
there followed what helmsman robert kagan later described as a 
bumpy ride eight holes were ripped in the dark blue hull of the 
2yearold 125 million ship the pride of exxons us fleet 
according to the ships log the tanker came to a stop at 1204 
am march 24 good friday 
hazelwood who hadnt radioed in almost an hour gave the coast 
guard the news at 1228 am 
weve fetched hard aground hazelwood said were leaking 
oil were going to be here awhile i just wanted to make a 
report 
initial pollution report uncertain due to darkness 
two minutes later the port of valdez was closed to all traffic 
the tug stalwart was dispatched to assist 
by sunrise oil was gurgling to the surface and the slick was 
1000 feet wide 
not until 11 am more than twice the period promised in the 
oil industrys spill response contingency plan was a containment 
boom snugged around the exxon valdez 
chemical dispersants applied to the slick at 6 pm did little 
because the water was so calm two hours later the tanker exxon 
baton rouge nestled alongside to begin pumping off the remaining 
oil by days end the spill was estimated at more than 10 million 
gallons 
the next evening emergency workers tried to set the oil on fire 
to burn it off but the effort failed 
on sunday the wind began to pick up churning the slick into a 
gooey mess covering more than 100 square miles and rendering all 
containment and cleanup methods ineffective 
monday the president of exxon shipping co conceded his company 
was a little overwhelmed later that day exxon revealed that 
hazelwood had a history of alcohol problems with two drunken 
driving convictions in the previous five years he had no 
automobile drivers license 
by this time the oil was described as the consistency of 
chocolate mousse reports of bird and animal contamination began 
trickling in 
tuesday march 28 the spill was moving like its on a 
superhighway and the first animal deaths were confirmed the oil 
terminal in valdez was reopened to restricted tanker traffic 
alarmed by the rapid spread of the oil toward vital hatcheries 
locals assembled a fleet of fishing boats to deploy containment 
booms at the mouths of bays and harbors exxons skimmers werent 
working 
president bush dispatched a team and two days later nixed the 
idea of having the federal government take the management helm 
coast guard commandant paul yost said he couldnt understand how 
it happened this is not treacherous in the area they went 
aground yost said its 10 miles wide your children could 
drive a tanker up through it 
exxon fired hazelwood after tests revealed his blood alcohol 
content was above legal limits nine hours after the wreck 
one week after the iridescent menace had begun seeping into the 
gulf of alaska threatening more fishing communities and a national 
park angry frustrated fishermen and unemployed laborers broke up 
an exxon briefing sending a federal bird expert from the podium in 
tears 
as march ended state authorities filed criminal charges against 
hazelwood for operating the vessel while intoxicated reckless 
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil 
the oil eventually spread over an area larger than delaware and 
the toll of dead birds sea otters and deer mounted steadily exxon 
apologized to the world for the spill in fullpage newspaper 
advertisements 
last wednesday the tanker was refloated and moved to a remote 
cove a kind of public exorcism of a great evil 
hazelwood turned himself in that day and posted bail thursday 
two weeks after good friday oil reached a national park and 
officials confirmed the obvious the spill has grown so large only 
natures forces tides winds and ocean currents will be able to 
remove it 
the oil is unmanageable said jim hayden the states 
cleanup coordinator its just immense i dont think a spill 
this size is controllable now

when the texas air corp board met in houston 
last week peter v ueberroth assumed he had a done deal 
but texas air chairman frank lorenzos telephone call contained 
news ueberroth did not expect lorenzo said that hotel mogul jay a 
pritzker had made a higher offer 
peter told him congratulations if i were you id take it 
a source familiar with the deal said 
an hour later lorenzo called back and asked ueberroth what he 
was going to do 
id take it a source quoted ueberroth as saying of 
pritzkers offer i just told you an hour ago were history 
the thinking was that there was not less than a 50 percent 
chance that there would be a deal a source familiar with the 
negotiations said 
he used the ueberroth negotiating strategy of a phantom bid 
one ueberroth friend said of lorenzo 
ueberroth according to friends said he felt betrayed by 
lorenzo he went home to california for his final day as baseball 
commissioner and a weekend of golf 
but by monday intermediaries got the two sides talking again 
and by tuesday according to several sources ueberroths lawyers 
and texas air officials were negotiating again 
henry steinman of the new york law firm latham amp watkins headed 
the ueberroth negotiating team by tuesday afternoon ueberroths 
side thought a deal had been reached ueberroth returned to new 
york on tuesday night and on wednesday he began personal 
negotiations with lorenzo at latham amp watkins offices 
all through wednesday ueberroth and lorenzo stuggled with 
details lorenzos people claimed ueberroth was nitpicking and 
ueberroths people claimed lorenzo was trying to change terms 
previously agreed to 
the sides argued about landing slots and gates at new yorks 
laguardia airport about the way notes receiveable would be 
transfered from eastern to texas air dozens of people went in and 
out of the conference room during the talks which began at 730 
am and continued until just before 8 pm 
on thursday morning at 730 they went back at it but in the 
final stages ueberroth and lorenzo did the negotiating oneonone 
sources said and at about 1215 the two signed an agreement of 
less than a dozen pages the airline would be sold to a new 
corporation eastern airlines employees and service company 
about 90 minutes later lorenzo and ueberroth walked to the 
nearby summit hotel ueberroth was wearing the same redandgray 
paisley tie he wore dec 14 when he announced baseballs 106 
billion fouryear contract with cbs 
it was about that time that ueberroth had become interested in 
eastern baseball sources said carl r pohlad owner of baseballs 
minnesota twins also owned 12 percent of jet capital corp texas 
airs holding company with labor troubles coming up pohlad asked 
ueberroth if he would be interested 
ueberroth went to miami and spoke with the pilots union in 
december not much happened until ealy march when the machinists 
union struck and pilots and flight attendants walked off in 
support ueberroth sensed the opportunity 
the bankruptcy indicated it was achievable said barry rona 
of the baseball owners player relations committee one of the few 
people willing to speak on the record it became obvious as the 
days went by that you were going to need new ownership and a new 
management team to get the airline running again

peter v ueberroth brings to eastern airlines a 
reputation as a nononsense manager and financial wizard 
responsible for turning around ailing enterprises and honing his 
public image in the process 
that track record explains why the 1984 olympics organizer and 
former baseball commissioner agreed thursday to buy a seemingly 
hopeless airline beset by years of labor strife and 32 billion in 
debt 
its certainly going to rank up there in attractiveness in 
peters goals and aspirations which is to take on a challenge 
said barry rona who heads the negotiating team for baseballs 
owners 
you can count on one thing peter will make money for 
everyone rona added if it turns out there are shareholders 
hell make money for shareholders his partners will make money 
the employees will make money and peter will make money 
easterns last profitable quarter was in 1985 during an 
industrywide boom eastern since then has been hampered by labor 
problems its tarnished image and a corporate streamlining 
analysts said 
we are not miracle workers at all in any way shape or form 
ueberroth 51 said at a news conference announcing the 464 
million deal i think most people will bet against us 
ueberroth who stepped down as baseball commissioner last 
saturday isnt the first to take on the challenge of 60yearold 
eastern 
eddie rickenbacker the world war i flying ace ran the airline 
from 1935 until his ouster by easterns board in 1964 he built 
eastern into a major national carrier but made passenger 
convenience a low priority 
he was one of those typical old pioneers said aviation 
historian robert serling eastern reflected rickenbackers own 
image tightfisted but close to the vest nononsense to hell 
with service 
two other men led eastern from 1964 to 1975 when former apollo 
8 astronaut frank borman took over the airline but the airline 
retained its reputation for bad service 
as an eastern vice president borman was known for visiting 
workers from baggage handlers to flight attendants on the job when 
he became president he turned to erasing the bad service image 
he was the first airline chief executive who allowed himself 
to become the symbol of the airline itself through television and 
newspaper ads said serling who collaborated on bormans 1988 
autobiography countdown long before lee iacocca did frank 
was appearing in television commercials 
borman began appearing on television about a year after taking 
over eastern pledging easterns dedication to service we have 
to earn our wings every day the slogan went 
lorenzo chairman of texas air corp acquired eastern in 1986 
with the blessing of easterns unions most of which had accepted 
wage concessions to help the financially ailing carrier the union 
endorsement came even though lorenzo had taken continental airlines 
into bankruptcy court and broke its unions 
now comes ueberroth who was vice president of trans 
international airlines for two years before he founded a travel 
agency in southern california in 1963 first travel corp 
ueberroth and his brother sold first travel in 1979 to carlson

weakness in sales at some big chain stores may be more evidence 
that consumers are losing their spending enthusiasm as overall 
economic activity eases analysts say 
reports thursday from many of the nations major general 
merchandise discount and apparel stores sent mixed signals about 
the march performance 
opinions ranged from sears roebuck and co saying its sales 
were better than anticipated to k mart corp describing its volume 
as disappointing 
its hard to look at these numbers and make any 
generalizations said karen sack of standard amp poors corp 
its kind of a mixed month there are some good doubledigit 
numbers in there though 
allen sinai of boston co economic advisers inc said the chain 
store sales were consistent with recent statistics showing a 
moderation in growth 
it was widely anticipated that consumer spending which accounts 
for about twothirds of overall economic activity would contract 
in reaction to the increases in interest rates this year 
expenditures for costly items that are normally financed over 
time already have fallen as indicated by the weak march auto sales 
the car manufacturers reported earlier this week 
most analysts refused to attach too much significance to the 
march numbers preferring to defer judgment on the retail outlook 
until aprils sales are tallied 
realistically we have to look at march and april combined to 
get a good assessment of whats happening said jeffrey edelman 
an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
for march cold stormy weather in parts of the country and the 
loss of a selling day due to store closures for the easter holiday 
were cited as reasons for the mediocre results of several big 
merchants 
sales during march were disappointing as colderthannormal 
weather adversely affected such key early spring businesses as our 
outdoor garden shop home improvement and ladies apparel said k 
mart chairman joseph e antonini 
k mart the secondlargest us retailer said sales in the five 
weeks ended march 29 were 242 billion up 25 percent from 236 
billion in march a year ago 
sales at k mart stores open for at least a year called 
comparable or samestore sales slid 08 percent from the yearago 
level 
retailers and industry analysts say samestore sales give a 
better reading of a companys performance than totals that include 
sales at newly opened stores not every retailer reports samestore 
sales 
the biggest us retailer sears said sales were even better 
than it hoped they would be in the month in which the company 
introduced a new competitive pricing policy 
sears posted an 119 percent sales increase to 297 billion 
from 266 billion 
its samestore sales rose a healthy 96 percent and 154 percent 
after adjustment for the loss of 2 selling days due to easter and 
the closing of sears more than 800 stores nationwide for repricing 
in preparation for the switch to an everyday low prices program 
the gains at sears may have cut into the sales growth at 
competitors stores but analysts said it is too early to tell how 
much of an impact sears new strategy is having 
elsewhere specialty apparel retailers showed signs that the 
sales rebound that began late last year has continued 
good results at stores such as the gap inc limited inc and 
several department store chains such as neiman marcus group inc 
indicated current fashions were selling well 
the figures released thursday were from the biggest general 
merchandise chains and apparel retailers unlike monthly retail 
sales figures released by the government they do not cover sales 
at auto dealers supermarkets or retaurants 
here are some of the results 
walmart stores inc the fastgrowing discount and general 
merchandise chain based in bentonville ark reported march sales 
totaled 192 billion up 26 percent from 153 billion in march 
1988 samestore sales rose 12 percent 
jc penney co said sales amounted to 1233 billion in the 
five weeks to april 1 up 07 percent from 1225 billion a year 
earlier on a comparable store basis sales fell 2 percent 
dayton hudson corp a minneapolisbased store operator said 
sales rose 64 percent in the five weeks ended april 1 to 11 
billion from 1 billion comparablestore sales edged up 09 percent 
fw woolworth co said its domestic sales increased 54 percent 
in the five weeks ended april 1 to 482 million from 457 million 
domestic samestore sales rose 13 percent 
limited incs sales rose 15 percent in the five weeks ended 
april 1 to 3938 million from 3433 million comparable store

attorneys for ivan f boesky plan to ask a 
federal judge to reduce his threeyear jail term on grounds that 
the convicted inside traders cooperation led to the indictment of 
junk bond financier michael milken sources say 
boesky became eligible for parole last month after one year in a 
minimum security prison but probably will seek early release from 
the judge in manhattan who sentenced him not from prison 
officials an attorney involved in the case said thursday 
attorneys will have to prove that boesky should be rewarded for 
providing information that led the government to milken the former 
drexel burnham lambert inc financier charged last week with 98 
counts of racketeering and securities fraud 
boeskys lawyers decided to wait to seek his release until after 
the milken indictment because they felt the judge and the prison 
would not otherwise be sympathetic to freeing the man widely 
considered the embodiment of wall street corruption in the 
mid1980s 
a very big piece of his contribution which could not be 
revealed now has been revealed said the attorney who asked not 
to be named thats the principal reason for the earlier delay 
boesky was eligible for parole march 21 two days before his 
oneyear anniversary inside the lompoc calif prison camp where 
the onetime stock speculator is working on a cleanup crew 
in a plea for leniency boeskys attorneys in april 1988 filed a 
request for us district judge morris lasker to reduce the 
sentence on grounds that information boesky gave prosecutors 
unearthed other fraud cases including the charges against milken 
and charges that led to a separate 650 million criminal plea deal 
with drexel 
as these pending investigations mature into criminal and civil 
charges the extraordinary extent and value of mr boeskys 
cooperation will become even more evident than it was at 
sentencing the attorneys wrote at the time 
they asked lasker to wait until last october to hear the motion 
then requested another delay 
its likely that will be reactivated soon the attorney 
said but did not specify when the request would be made 
assistant us attorney bruce baird who heads the manhattan 
us attorneys office securities fraud division declined to 
comment on boesky 
boesky 52 paid 100 million in december 1986 to settle charges 
by the securities and exchange commission that he illegally used 
inside information to profit from securities deals 
he then cooperated in the governments wideranging probe of 
whitecollar wall street crime supplying information used toward 
civil or criminal charges in more than a dozen case in the united 
states and britain 
in exchange boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count of 
conspiracy to lie to the sec lasker in december 1987 sentenced him 
to three years in jail his earliest possible nonparole release 
date based on good behavior is april 4 1990 
the next parole hearing at the 689inmate lompoc facility 
known as club fed because of recreational facilities including 
tennis and boccie ball courts is set for may prison spokesman 
gavin oconnor said boeskys lawyers have not asked for his case 
to be placed on the docket 
even if he remains a prisoner boesky still could be summoned to 
testify as the main witness against milken if that case goes to 
trial milken has denied any wrongdoing and said he would fight the 
charges against him 
many of the charges against milken who was placed on leave as 
head of drexels highyield bond division after the indictment 
center on deals allegedly made with boesky involving takeovers 
stock manipulation and parking schemes to conceal securities 
ownership 
as part of his plea deal boesky agreed to cooperate with the 
government sources said the government has not contacted his 
attorneys yet about testifying at a milken trial

a criminal plea bargain by drexel burnham 
lambert inc could be jeopardized if the investment firm fails to 
resolve separate civil charges with the securities and exchange 
commission by monday a prosecutor said 
assistant us attorney bruce baird said thursday the government 
does not plan a lengthy extension of the deadline which already 
has been extended several times 
failure to reach a pact would nullify the manhattan us 
attorneys offices landmark plea deal with the wall street 
investment firm and raise the possibility of a far more serious 
indictment on fraud and racketeering charges 
settling civil charges including insider trading brought by the 
sec last september was a precondition for drexels criminal plea 
bargain three months later under which it agreed to plead guilty 
to six felonies and pay a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution 
if the deadline is not met or extended the government could 
bring a criminal indictment and force a trial of drexel which has 
been under federal investigation for more than two years 
drexel agreed to the plea deal partly so it could avoid a 
crippling indictment under the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act which carries enormous fines and allows 
prosecutors to seize assets before trial 
officials familiar with the sec talks said a pact could be 
approved by monday or shortly thereafter 
baird who heads the us attorneys securities and commodities 
fraud unit in manhattan said drexel and the sec initially agreed 
to complete their negotiations jan 30 just six days after laying 
out terms for negotiations 
that deadline was extended several times by mutual consent of 
prosecutors and drexel as talks snagged 
baird said no discussions were planned to try to extend the 
monday deadline if there is an extension he said it will be a 
brief one 
thomas newkirk sec chief litigation counsel declined to 
comment on whether the deal could be reached by monday 
i think were still hoping to have an agreement and well see 
how it goes drexel spokesman steven anreder said 
one of the major obstacles in the agreement designed to force 
drexel to crack down on internal policing reportedly has been an 
sec demand that drexel fire michael milken architect of its junk 
bond financing department that transformed the firm into a wall 
street power 
milken took a leave of absence after he and two others were 
charged march 29 with 98 counts of racketeering and securities 
fraud and his departure may satisfy the sec drexel has a policy 
that all indicted employees must be placed on leave 
but milken has undertaken a legal challenge to provisions of the 
criminal settlement that require drexel to fire him and withhold 
his 1988 pay of more than 100 million milken claims it violates 
his rights 
meanwhile sources confirmed thursday that david solomon chief 
investment officer of solomon asset management is negotiating with 
prosecutors to cooperate in the governments case against milken 
solomon whose firm manages about 15 billion in junk bond 
investments would be the first drexel client to testify against 
milken should he become a witness several former drexel employees 
have testified against the firm in exchange for immunity during the 
governments probe

senate democrats opened debate on a 
minimumwage bill by thanking president bush for his support of an 
increase but moving forward with their own plan after criticizing 
the presidents as too modest and his attitude as too reticent 
dont give us a takeitorleaveit proposal sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio said thursday after bush promised again to veto 
any bill other than his thats the kind of administration weve 
had the last eight years confrontation confrontation 
confrontation 
it appears however that a showdown is inevitable if not 
imminent 
sponsors were hoping for a final vote today but were unable to 
reach agreement with republicans meaning the debate likely will 
extend into next week amendments lowering the final minimum wage 
target to 455 from 465 and providing for a 60day subminimum 
wage for new workers were likely to be offered with the resumption 
of debate today 
sen orrin hatch of utah the republican floor leader urged 
democrats to accept bushs proposal as a compromise 
president bush has extended an opportunity to the congress to 
enact a minimum wage increase hatch said in my opinion it is 
a worthy alternative to the proposal now before us 
sen edward m kennedy dmass and chief sponsor of the senate 
bill entered into a compromise with southern democrats over the 
455 top minimum that appears to give him more than enough votes 
to win passage 
bush however appears to have the votes necessary to sustain a 
veto 
the amendments would bring the senate bill in line with a 
housepassed measure whether the bill would go straight to bush 
appears dependent on the senate provisions for the subminimum the 
proposal being discussed late thursday was slightly different from 
what is in the house bill 
the housepassed bill allows a subminimum to be paid to new 
hires for two months but only if it was their first job the 
tentative senate provision allows the subminimum to be paid to any 
worker in that workers first 60 days in the job market regardless 
of how many jobs the person held in that period both proposals 
would abolish the subminimum in october 1992 
kennedy opened the debate by saying bushs support for some 
increase was a welcome change after the reagan administrations 
dogged opposition to any boost 
eight years of stonewalling against the minimum wage are 
over said kennedy still he said bushs proposal gives too 
little protection to the nations lowwage workers 
the minimum wage has been 335 since 1981 
both the housepassed bill and the amendments kennedy promised 
to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to 385 on oct 1 
to 425 on oct 1 1990 and to 455 a year later 
bushs proposal calls for an increase to 365 on jan 1 1990 
to 395 a year later and a final jump to 425 on jan 1 1992 
the presidents measure would allow employers to pay new workers 
335 an hour for their first six months that subminimum would 
rise to 340 an hour in 1992

eastern airlines strikers calling their monthlong 
walkout a victory say theyre ready to take pay cuts and get back 
to work as long as its without boss frank lorenzo at the 
controls 
cautious union leaders however warned the strike wont end 
until new contracts are signed but most workers jubilantly greeted 
the sale to a group including former baseball commissioner peter 
ueberroth as a done deal even though it reportedly involves some 
210 million in union concessions 
the 464 million agreement would give employees a 30 percent 
share in the company in exchange for wage concessions eastern 
under parent company texas air corp had demanded 125 million in 
wage and benefits cuts 
this is better than winning the lottery because 30000 people 
won it together said flight attendant alice martinez its 
wonderful 
she and her husband jorge an eastern mechanic said all the 
workers know current wage levels will be dropping mechanics for 
example earn a top wage of 1883 an hour and ramp service workers 
1560 an hour pay at easterns major competitors ranges from 16 
to 2010 an hour for mechanics and 1551 to 1745 for ramp 
service workers 
but though the cuts will hurt they said they would gladly 
sacrifice to save the miamibased airline without texas air 
chairman lorenzo 
moreover broader issues were at stake martinez said 
whatever happens here at eastern is going to dictate what 
happens with the rest of the airlines and in other industries 
too he said we had been stripped of our dignity while we were 
working for frank lorenzo now we have it back and we are going 
to rebuild the airline 
employees blamed lorenzos attitude toward workers not wage 
disputes for the atmosphere of crisis that culminated in the march 
4 strike by 8500 workers mostly mechanics and baggage handlers 
most eastern pilots and flight attendants have refused to cross 
picket lines 
ken walters an eastern pilot expressed the strikers 
widespread admiration for ueberroth 
the first thing that came out of his mouth was he wanted to 
share the airline with the workers walters said the first 
thing to come out of lorenzos mouth was i dont talk to unions 
 
stephanie orent a mechanic said she knew the economic 
sacrifices made during the strike would be hard to make up but 
said it was worth it despite the expected pay cuts 
i dont know what it translates into in dollars and cents but 
were willing to give she said well just tighten our belts 
we all want eastern to survive and we cant wait to get back to 
work 
ramp service worker jose lorie said the cost of the walkout was 
not just economic 
ive been hurt my wifes been hurt economically emotionally 
my nerves have been affected and we know the airline has been 
hurt how much well have to find out he said 
he said he was a little taken aback about suddenly becoming an 
owner of a company he has been on strike against 
my feelings are confused he said but i feel a lot better 
now that ill be a part of the airline its like something extra 
not everyone was ecstatic about the sale with some saying they 
want to see the fine print 
ive seen so much deception that im not going to pick up my 
tools until ive seen the contract said julio valentine a 
terminal maintenance worker for 23 years who said he had emptied 
his bank account since the strike began 
but even valentine said that if union leaders recommended it he 
would be willing to make concessions to ueberroth 
pilot sal fallovallita said the strike had brought eastern 
workers together as never before and the new team spirit would 
help in rebuilding the airline 
people go where they get a good product he said and 
were going to give them a good product

two texas aampm scientists say the beef industry 
has done well by reducing the amount of fat served consumers in 
their steaks and hamburgers but they warned that the job isnt 
finished 
h russell cross and jeff savell said work continues on 
resolving questions about fats and health notably the dietary 
linkage to high levels of blood cholesterol 
savell on thursday told a conference sponsored by the national 
cattlemens association that if he had to send cattle producers and 
the beef industry a note from the teacher it might say 
excellent progress made in making product fit consumers needs 
keep working on leanness convenience and cost value remember to 
maintain taste or consumers will go elsewhere 
the beef industry drew praise from jay fletcher of the community 
nutrition institute a citizens interest group that conducts 
research on nutrition and food policy issues fletcher agreed that 
less fat is being sold to consumers 
i think they have done more than many other industries to 
recognize the dangers of excessive fat consumption and take steps 
to inform consumers about that fletcher said in a telephone 
interview 
but selling meat is also a business he said and the beef 
industry wants to recover the market share it has steadily lost to 
chicken and poultry in general over the past 10 years 
fletcher said that occurred largely because of consumer 
perception of beef as a highfat food 
it was just a year ago that the agriculture department released 
a study by texas aampm led by cross and savell that showed the 
trimmable fat on retail cuts of beef had been reduced 27 percent in 
two years 
the 45000 study paid for by the beef industry and usda 
showed that the average thickness of fat on steaks and roasts from 
primal cuts or the major wholesale cuts of beef was 014 inch 
while the average for all cuts from chuck roast to stew meat was 
011 inch or less than oneeighth of an inch 
most retailers have been using a quarterinch beef fat trim or 
less since 1985 compared with a standard of half an inch before 
that according to the industry 
at the conference cross said consumers have indicated they 
would pay for more closely trimmed beef preferably with external 
fat of less than oneeighth inch 
internal fat or marbling has been a factor in the taste of 
beef and cross said this still is important to consumers the 
challenge he said is to take fat off beef not out of it 
cross said that texas aampm meat scientists are currently working 
with medicine researchers at baylor college of medicine and the 
university of texas southwestern medical center on projects aimed 
at further improvements in the healthfulness of beef 
the work includes modification of the fatty acid content of meat 
products through changes in cattle feeds and products themselves 
fatty acids can potentially elevate cholestrol levels in human 
blood but cross said that even now only 27 percent of the total 
fat in beef is the type of saturated fatty acid that can raise 
cholesterol 
savell told of recent research on the composition of cooked as 
well as raw beef with reduced or no external fat for example if a 
slice of beef with all the fat trimmed off is cooked the fat 
content of the interior meat is reduced by 20 percent from a slice 
with a quarterinch layer of fat 
that is because less fat migrates from the outside into the meat 
tissue 
when you trim the fat off a steak that has a half inch of fat 
you get rid of half the total cholesterol savell said

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought more us corn and that china has been sold wheat 
at subsidized prices 
officials said thursday the soviet purchase was for 400000 
metric tons of corn to be delivered this year and that the wheat 
sale to china was for 300000 tons both deliveries are scheduled 
for this year 
more than 27 million tons have been purchased since the soviets 
resumed buying us corn on march 28 after a layoff of almost three 
months 
the latest sales brought total corn sold to the soviets for 
198889 to almost 13 million tons additionally sales include 4 
million tons of wheat 450000 tons of soybeans 14 million tons 
of soybean meal and 507400 tons of grain sorghum 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 400000 tons of 
corn would be about 158 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 245 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around 39 million 
john j reddington acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part 
of 2 million tons authorized feb 27 for china under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the latest sale boosted to about 85 million tons the amount of 
wheat sold to china for 198889 delivery under eep 
reddington said the latest sales were handled by garnac grain 
co inc 50000 tons bunge corp 50000 bartlett and co 
100000 and continental grain co 100000 
he said the wheat will carry an average subsidy rate of 633 
per ton or about 17 cents a bushel about 910000 tons are still 
available under the current authorization 
the 300000 tons would be about 11 million bushels and at 
recent prices of about 396 per bushel would have a farm value of 
around 44 million

the justice department says it will not oppose 
the proposed merger of time inc and warner communications inc 
to create the worlds largest entertainment and media conglomerate 
assistant attorney general charles f rule said thursday that a 
monthlong investigation of the proposed merger by the justice 
departments antitrust division concluded that the merger would not 
substantially lessen competition in any relevant market 
what we know suggests the merger is not anticompetitive and 
does not violate the law said rule who is in charge of 
antitrust division 
the investigation began after the march 4 announcement by time 
and warner of the stock swap that would create an 18 billion 
company combining the magazine publishing and cable television 
operations of time with warners recording and movie production 
interests 
rule said the antitrust division carefully examined the possible 
integration of warners movie and television production operations 
with times cabletelevision distribution systems 
time operates hbo and cinemax cable television networks warner 
owns cable interests through warner cable communications 
rule said the antitrust division did not object to the merger 
even though it would enable the combined company to both produce 
and distribute movies and television shows 
a survey of the industry showed that a number of cable outlets 
have exclusive relationships with movie studios we didnt feel 
this would substantially increase the exclusivity already in 
place in the industry rule said 
showtime another cable movie channel started the exclusive 
arrangements to enable it to compete more effectively against hbo 
rule said 
the department will continue to monitor the cable industry to 
ensure that these arrangements do not result in restraint of trade 
he said 
if there was harm to competition we would have gone into 
court to challenge the deal he said 
rule said both companies must still get approval from local 
cable franchising authorities 
the conglomerate timewarner inc is expected to have annual 
revenues of 10 billion 
if the merger is approved by shareholders the combined company 
would surpass rupert murdochs australia news corp as the worlds 
biggest media and entertainment conglomerate 
besides publishing time people and sports illustrated 
magazines time owns timelife books and the bookofthemonth club 
warner operates warner brothers movie and television studios as 
well as warner recording which counts madonna among its recording 
artists

federal law should treat insurance companies 
the same as other businesses says a senator who is leading his 
third charge against a special antitrust exemption for the industry 
the case for repealing the insurance industrys antitrust 
exemption is overwhelming sen howard metzenbaum dohio told a 
news conference thursday insurance is vital to the nation no 
one can be secure without it yet those who provide it do not have 
to comply with our national policy of free competition 
metzenbaum said the federal trade commission has been handcuffed 
by the exemption which makes it almost impossible to crack down on 
misleading advertising or deceptive marketing practices 
though attempts to ax the antitrust immunity failed in the 
previous two sessions of congress metzenbaum said the chances of 
repealing the mccarranferguson act have improved this year 
the only question is what is the timing he said my 
timing is now 
in february the american bar association formally joined the 
ranks of supporters and this week the insurance industrys biggest 
ratemaking organization bowed to pressure to stop distributing 
advisory rates 
companies had tended to keep their rates fairly close to those 
provided by the insurance services office inc leading to 
complaints that the advisory rates were akin to pricefixing the 
isos action is intended to squelch those complaints 
metzenbaum and sen paul simon dill who also appeared at the 
news conference stressed they were willing to negotiate with the 
insurance industry on the final shape of the legislation 
i dont think any harm would come to the insurance industry if 
it went into effect wordforword as sen metzenbaum is introducing 
it but neither he nor i nor anyone else is suggesting this is in 
concrete simon said 
david pratt the american insurance associations vice president 
for federal affairs said negotiation with metzenbaum would be 
pointless 
were not going to negotiate with him pratt said i dont 
think wed get very far theres no agreement on the basic 
premises 
pratt said the socalled safe harbors in the bill that 
shelter some combined endeavors would not work they are 
inefective in truly allowing for the joint activities we find vital 
to make sure insurance is fairly priced he said 
metzenbaums bill would repeal the insurance industrys 
antitrust exemption but allow states to continue individually to 
regulate insurance under his bill insurance companies would still 
be able to work together but joint activities would be limited to 
collection and exchange of historical loss data and information 
on fraudulent claims 
research for classifying public fire defenses 
preparation of standardized forms 
the bill also would leave untouched joint underwriting 
staterequired residual market mechanisms and pools that do not 
unreasonably restrain trade 
consumer banking and smallbusiness groups have been calling 
for repeal or amendment of the industrys antitrust exemptions 
a proposal in the house seeks to narrow those exemptions 
a bill sponsored by rep james florio dnj calls for a ban 
on the sharing of information to determine premiums or coverage 
areas 
it also would forbid tiein sales such as a requirement 
that a motorist buy a homeowners policy with the auto policy and 
ban any action to impair the availability or affordability of 
insurance 
the insurance industry also opposes that measure which a florio 
aide said has struck a nerve

taking advantage of eastern airlines monthlong 
absence from the regional market american airlines plans to add 11 
flights in miami and 13 in the caribbean by june 
american officials thursday said the move resulted from 
longterm planning by the airline saying the strike by easterns 
machinists union merely pushed ahead americans expansion program 
the strike that started march 4 has reduced easterns service to 
less than 10 percent of its normal daily flight roster 
thursdays announcement that peter ueberroths group is buying 
eastern and plans to return the miamibased carrier to full 
operation appeared not to bother americans senior vice president 
for operations robert baker 
the likelihood is that eastern will still be the largest 
carrier in the region said baker none of what we have 
announced today will rise and fall on what happens to eastern 
airlines or anyone else 
americans new schedule raises the carriers flights from 20 to 
31 a day out of miami and from 45 to 52 a day out of san juan 
puerto rico 
baker said easterns troubles were not a major factor in the 
expansion plans noting that american announced last august long 
before easterns labormanagement showdown that it would install 
a new crew base here 
but baker said american quickly decided to follow through on the 
plan when the eastern strike began march 4

walt disney co is grumpy no more it got an 
apology and dropped its lawsuit over the use of a snow white 
lookalike in the opening of the academy awards 
the academy sincerely apologizes to disney for the 
unauthorized use of disneys copyrighted snow white character and 
for unintentionally creating the impression that disney had 
sanctioned the opening production number on the academy awards 
telecast richard kahn president of the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences said thursday 
disney alleged in its suit filed in us district court that 
oscar producers lacked permission to use disneys fairy tale 
character 
the lawsuit was filed among other things to remedy the 
confusion surrounding disneys perceived involvement with the 
opening of the academy awards telecast said disney president 
frank wells 
in agreeing to drop the suit disney said there will be an 
appropriate court stipulation in which the academy agrees not to 
reuse the segment featuring disneys snow white for any 
purpose 
wells said last week the matter could have been settled without 
litigation if the academy had publicly apologized after the show 
for its own reasons however the academy unfortunately did 
not accede to our request wells said 
the spoof was created by steve silver producer of the camp 
beach blanket babylon revue which moved this week from club 
fugazi in san francisco to las vegas disney is also unhappy with 
that production which includes a snow white character played by 
the same actress 
we havent ignored it weve had discussions and thats all i 
can really say said disney spokesman erwin okun 
no lawsuits have been filed against silver so far he said 
the oscars broadcast seen in about 27 million american homes 
began with actress eileen bowman dressed as snow white following 
a chorus line of dancing stars into the shrine auditorium 
in a squeaky betty boop voice bowman then launched into a 
rendition of we only have stars for you to the tune of i 
only have eyes for you she also sang a rendition of proud 
mary with actor rob lowe 
we pride ourselves on our meticulousness in obtaining the 
proper legal clearances for all music film and other material used 
on our show and regret that we didnt do it with disney kahn 
said in his apology 
snow white and the seven dwarfs was released by disney in 
1937 and was the studios first featurelength animated cartoon 
critics praised the film calling it a turning point in disneys 
career and a milestone in movie history

as the american auto industry prepares to 
offer automatic restraints on all their cars at least half of 
americas drivers would fail a simple quiz about what air bags do 
a survey shows 
despite the lack of knowledge about the safety technology 
however 62 percent of the adult licensed drivers who had heard of 
air bags approved of their use according to the survey released 
thursday by the american coalition for traffic safety 
among the misconceptions about air bags widely held by american 
drivers were these 
seventyone percent were moderately or very concerned that the 
air bag might not inflate 
sixtysix percent thought the air bag might inflate when it 
shouldnt 
fiftyseven percent were worried the air bag might block vision 
fortyeight percent thought the air bag might pin them in their 
car 
twentytwo percent believed that kicking a car bumper could 
make an air bag inflate 
these myths and misconceptions reflect a knowledge gap that 
must be filled said philip haseltine executive director of the 
coalition a lobbying group supported by the major automakers 
the study based on 1500 interviews found that only 11 percent 
who knew what air bags were disapproved of them and 22 percent had 
no opinion five percent had never heard of air bags 
i think its difficult to educate the public about a 
technology thats not available in large numbers haseltine said 
i think its not so much a matter of somebody falling down on the 
job 
the publics knowledge of the passive restraints a term 
unfamiliar to 49 percent of the people surveyed likely will 
increase as such systems become more common in cars haseltine said 
cars sold in the united states beginning with the 1990 model 
year must be equipped either with air bags which inflate during a 
frontal collision or seat belts that automatically hook up when 
the door is closed or the engine started 
the nations largest automaker general motors corp said this 
week it will install driverside air bags as standard equipment on 
13 of its 1990 models 
ford motor co plans to equip 11 of its 1990 models with air 
bags and chrysler corp all of next years models 
eightytwo percent of the people surveyed said they would keep 
wearing safety belts even though their cars had air bags and 65 
percent said they believed auto insurers should reduce rates on 
airbag equipped vehicles 
the american coalition for traffic safetys survey was conducted 
by telephone between march 20 and march 28 and had a 26 percent 
margin of error 
the organizations members include the big three us automakers 
and american honda motor corp

the agriculture department says its premature 
to move forward with a drought assistance package for winter wheat 
farmers but members of congress are ignoring the advice 
legislation was introduced thursday in the house to make federal 
aid available to winter wheat growers by extending drought programs 
enacted last year 
usda has said the 1989 crop of winter wheat the breadmaking 
wheat planted last fall but not harvested until this year doesnt 
qualify for any of the 39 billion in drought assistance approved 
in 1988 
at a hearing of a house agriculture subcommittee top usda 
officials maintained a waitandsee approach to dry weather 
persisting in parts of the country particularly the major winter 
wheatgrowing states of kansas texas oklahoma southern nebraska 
and eastern colorado 
we dont know there is going to be a widespread disaster 
said ewen m wilson usdas assistant secretary for economics we 
will have to monitor the situation and see if it rains and see how 
bad it is 
in fact a highly tentative projection by usda suggests 
total wheat production might rebound 35 percent from last years 
droughtstricken harvest making it the biggest crop since 1984 
the agencys response frustrated and angered members of the 
committee who fear that wheat states might end up without the kind 
of assistance provided last year to corn belt farmers they took 
pains to note that in 1988 a presidential election year usda was 
quick to agree with the need for drought relief 
we know there is going to be a disaster we know people are 
going to be affected said rep glenn english dokla the only 
question is how many 
rep pat roberts rkan who introduced the new drought aid 
measure said we are suffering we were able to work with corn 
country last year it is our time 
according to usda the winter wheat outlook is especially gloomy 
in kansas traditionally the nations largest producer at the 
start of the month 70 percent of the kansas wheat crop was rated 
poor to very poor kansas normally accounts for 17 percent of total 
us wheat production and 35 percent of the nations hard red 
winter wheat 
the prospect of a damaged harvest comes at a time when global 
wheat supplies are at their lowest point in 15 years 
a private agricultural analyst john schnittker warned the 
subcommittee that poor us crops in 1989 would further shrink 
grain stockpiles and pose a serious threat to world food 
sufficiency and price stability 
wilson conceded that drought could sharply reduce winter wheat 
harvests in some areas but he and another usda official held out 
hope that spring rains might rescue part of the crop 
norton strommen usdas chief meteorologist said the next 30 to 
60 days would be critical the 90day weather outlook suggests near 
normal rainfall in much of the wheat belt across the great plains 
although below normal rainfall is expected in the short term 
because the winter wheat crop is developing later than usual 
strommen said we have a mixed picture 
its just a little premature to start to write the crop down 
to any specific level said strommen we simply have to watch 
and wait for the development and the timing and distribution of 
rainfall in the next two months

the white house is showing new flexibility on 
taxes but agreement with congress on any specifics is not imminent 
the chairman of the senate finance committee says 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said thursday that treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and president bushs budget director 
richard darman indicated in a meeting that the president would 
accept modifications of his plan to cut the capital gains tax rate 
and other tax proposals in his fiscal 1990 budget 
but the capital gains plan which the administration claims 
would raise 48 billion next year still stood little chance of 
passage bentsen said 
there is great disagreement on which taxes to raise or user 
fees as the administration prefers said bentsen we have a lot 
of negotiating to do on that and im not sure how it will come 
out bentsen said 
the grammrudman law mandates reducing the deficit to 100 
billion in fiscal 1990 which would require about 28 billion in 
new revenues or in spending restraint according to white house 
estimates 
bentsen said there was widespread agreement that about 14 
billion in new revenues will be included in a budget package this 
year that includes not only about 56 billion in taxes but sales 
of government assets user fees and increased enforcement of 
existing taxes 
brady and darman declined to comment on whether the white house 
was revising the 14 billion in revenues in its fiscal 1990 budget 
bentsen said the administration absolutely could find 
revenueraising ideas that congress would accept but he did not 
offer any specifics and said he doubted any would be nailed down 
soon 
no way they are going to get that agreement by today on the 
revenue side he said 
the meeting with bentsen was one of a series of visits brady and 
darman have had with senior members of the house and senate 
taxwriting committees they also continued talks with 
congressional budgetwriters on an overall spending and revenue 
framework for the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said thursdays discussions focused on spending 
restraint on entitlement programs including agriculture subsidies 
panetta said he was still hopeful a broad consensus could be 
reached on friday but he softened his talk of moving ahead 
immediately with his own package in his committee if the 
negotiations drag on 
im hopeful but i think theres also a chance that we are 
going to slip into next week he said

the board of directors of coleco 
industries inc once one of the nations largest toy companies 
has dropped plans to sell the company in a reversal of an earlier 
decision 
the reversal was made as the board voted to amend its bankruptcy 
reorganization plan to head off complaints that the company is not 
offering its unsecured creditors adequate compensation 
morton e handel chairman of colecos board of directors said 
the board decided against pursuing a sale of the company on the 
grounds that maintaining coleco as an independent ongoing 
business is in the best interests of the creditors and 
shareholders 
in february the board of directors had authorized management to 
explore selling coleco as a means of solving its financial problems 
the new reorganization plan announced thursday is intended 
to satisfy the needs expressed by the unsecured creditors during 
bankruptcy proceedings in new york federal court handel stated 
the avon connbased company which makes cabbage patch dolls 
and other toys filed for protection from creditors under chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in july 1988 
colecos unsecured creditors have criticized a reorganization 
plan filed by the company in january saying it did not offer them 
enough 
us district judge prudence b abram who is presiding over the 
bankruptcy proceedings said last month coleco should not be 
surprised that most creditors objected strongly to the original 
plan abram said i cant think of another plan where ive seen 
the unsecured creditors so wholly wiped out as they are in this 
case 
the board of directors said the amended version would 
represent a substantial improvement for the unsecured 
creditors who include bondholders manufacturers and advertising 
agencies coleco owes them more than 400 million 
under the proposed amendment which must be approved by the 
federal bankruptcy court the unsecured creditors will receive 
stock in coleco giving them ownership of about 37 percent of the 
company 
handel said the unsecured creditors will also receive a package 
of other securities cash notes and other debt instruments 
handel said the package will be worth about 40 million or 10 
cents per dollar of their claims 
the amendment also calls for the secured creditors those first 
in line for repayment to convert their current claim of about 80 
million into coleco common stock giving them 60 percent ownership 
of the company 
the remaining approximately 3 percent of the company will stay 
in the hands of current owners of preferred and common stock 
handel said the proposal has been approved by the secured 
creditors new york financiers isaac perlmutter and bernard marden 
he said it would be submitted to the bankruptcy court in new york 
before april 25

acme boots elephantskin boots will 
vanish from stores by midsummer as production of the 200apair 
footwear ceases because of possible poaching in africa 
acme the worlds largest boot manufacturer dropped the line of 
casual boots this week after several years of production the 
60yearold company continues to make footwear from the skins of 
exotic creatures including the ostrich snake lizard alligator 
and eel 
acme based in clarksville tenn said its purchases of african 
elephant hides made through an importer were legal but special 
interest groups had questioned the treatment of elephants by others 
we have seen increased concern by environmentalists and 
consumer groups about illegal poaching for tusks not for hides 
said bill whitlock acme vice president of marketing 
they have run ads showing grotesque pictures he said 
thursday this drew our concern we thought it best to 
disassociate ourselves with it in general even though this involved 
tusks and not hides 
no special interest groups had contacted acme about dropping the 
line there was no pressure whitlock said 
the elephantskin boots which were dyed mostly in light colors 
to fit a casual image accounted for less than 1 percent of acmes 
total production 
the boots are very masculine rugged looking whitlock said 
they were tough they wore well and had a long life they went 
well with jeans

a congressional panel rejected an attempt to 
force texas and other states with lax regulations to help pay for 
the savings and loan mess a provision one member said would have 
started a second civil war 
meeting as regulatory agencies made two announcements 
underscoring the urgency of swift action the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions on thursday also decided to 
permit regulators to charge higher deposit insurance premiums to 
institutions engaged in speculative lending 
by a 2720 vote the subcommittee authorized the federal deposit 
insurance corp if it chooses to levy higher premiums against 
sampls and banks making highrisk investments 
the bush administration opposes the measure it is trying to 
prevent delay of its sampl rescue package by deferring ticklish 
deposit insurance issues until the completion of an 18month study 
the fdic said it took over 38 institutions bringing the total 
number of sampls under its supervision to 215 in 31 states the 
agency is attempting to hold losses down at the sickest sampls until 
congress appropriates the money to close or merge them 
meanwhile the federal home loan bank board said the industry 
suffered 94 billion in withdrawals in february the 10th 
consecutive month of outflows and down only slightly from the 106 
billion record in january 
the house subcommittee in the first of three scheduled allday 
sessions slogged through 48 of 165 proposed amendments adopting 
two that would increase the power of the fdic over sampls and deny 
the bush administration some of the political control it had sought 
over the agency 
but it was a push by northern legislators to force texas 
california florida and other states with lax regulation of 
statechartered sampls to pay part of the bailout cost that generated 
the most heated debate 
the panel voted 397 against an amendment sponsored by reps 
paul e kanjorski dpa and marcy kaptur dohio requiring 
states with high numbers of statechartered thrift failures to 
contribute 20 percent of the cost of bailing them out 
the measure drew considerable sympathy but committee members 
argued against it for political reasons 
this would have sent the bill to fort sumter it would have 
started the second civil war rep barney frank dmass said 
after the vote 
rep jim leach riowa argued that attaching punitive measures 
to the sampl bill could draw a veto from president bush all i ask 
the people here is with this provision is there a slight chance 
that a texan in the white house will sign it 
kanjorski and kaptur argued that texas will get the lions share 
of the bailout 31 billion representing 1856 for every man 
woman and child in the state while most other states will pay more 
than they get 479 per capita in connecticut for instance 
what we are involved in here is the most mammoth transfer 
of resources from many regions of the country to one region of the 
country in the history of the republic everything else done by the 
government pales in comparison said rep john j lafalce dny 
however rep steve bartlett rtexas said the measure was 
unconstitutional arguing this is an excellent amendment for 
those who wish to vent anger but it is bad law 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the full banking 
panel called the amendment an outlandish and shoddily 
written concoction 
the fdic was one of the big winners in thursdays session it 
won support on a 3512 vote for an amendment giving it rather than 
the federal home loan bank system primary authority over 
statechartered sampls 
the measure was sponsored by leach who intended it as a rebuke 
to the bank system sampls chief lobby group the us league of 
savings institutions said in a letter thursday that they oppose a 
similar measure before the senate banking committee 
in a move to secure the political independence of the fdic the 
house panel provided fixed fouryear terms to its chairman and vice 
chairman the bush administration had proposed that the chairman 
serve at the pleasure of the president it also increased the 
fdics borrowing limit 
meanwhile the senate banking committee concluded three days of 
behindcloseddoor meetings intended to smooth the way for a full 
senate vote the week of april 17 the house subcommittee plans to 
finish its version of the bill next week

magistrates investigating italys biggest 
postwar banking scandal indicted 35 people friday but cleared 
financier carlo de benedetti of any wrongdoing in the collapse of 
banco ambrosiano 
licio gelli a financier accused of masterminding a ring of 
rightwing terrorism subversion and spying was among 34 people 
indicted on charges of complicity in fradulent bankruptcy 
the indictments also named gellis aide umberto ortolani an 
italianborn banker now living in brazil financier anna bonomi 
bolchini 23 board members and officials of the bank and eight 
other italian businessmen one woman was indicted for currency 
violations 
no truak date was announced 
the indictments stem from the 1982 collapse of banco ambrosiano 
italys biggest private bank it failed when it could not collect 
13 billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in latin america 
controlled by the vatican bank 
the vatican bank officially known as the institute for 
religious works was the largest shareholder in banco ambrosiano 
it agreed in 1984 to pay 250 million as part of banco ambrosianos 
bankruptcy settlement but said the payment was not an admission of 
responsibility 
italian courts ruled last year that a treaty between the vatican 
and italy prevents the prosecution of the vatican bank american 
archbishop paul marcinkus and two other top officials of that bank 
de benedetti who failed last year in a highly publicized 
attempt to take over the belgian group societe generale de 
belgique was notified in july 1987 that he was under investigation 
for his sale of banco ambrosiano shares shortly before it went 
bankrupt 
however the magistrates said friday there was no evidence of 
any wrongdoing by de benedetti whose financial empire includes the 
olivetti computer group and the mondadori publishing house 
i always expressed my total serenity in this area because i 
had full knowledge of not only having always acted in the full 
respect of the law but also of having exercised my duties as 
administrator with determination and transparency de benedetti 
said friday 
gelli was the grandmaster of the p2 propaganda due masonic 
lodge that investigators linked to crimes that included tax 
evasion bribery and conspiracy to topple the government he also 
was charged in connection with the 1980 bombing of the bologna 
train station that killed 85 people and injured 200 but wasnt 
brought to trial 
he was extradited to italy from switzerland last year on 
condition that he could be tried only on charges related to the 
collapse of banco ambrosiano

a judge ruled partially in favor of texas 
billionaire h ross perot in a breach of contract suit brought by 
the company he founded but later sold allowing him to continue 
operating his new perot systems co provided he makes no profit 
the ruling on thursday by fairfax circuit court judge william 
plummer followed four hours of debate by attorneys representing 
perot and electronic data systems the company based in plano 
texas he had founded 
attorneys for eds described perot as resolved to ruin his 
former company eds is trying to stop perot from operating his 
company and from recruiting employees away from eds 
perots lawyers replied that eds was overstating his contractual 
obligations to his former company and was laying legal traps to 
hold off a feared business adversary 
plummer left a final decision on the recruiting issue for monday 
when the trial reconvenes but he gave an opinion on the matter 
thursday that seemed to be a compromise 
the judge said perot may recruit from among his former eds 
colleagues but only those who were employed by the company before 
december 1986 when a noncompetition contract between the two 
firms was signed the usual contract prohibiting employees from 
joining a competing enterprise would be waived in the case of perot 
systems because the contract acknowledged their special allegiance 
to perot the judge said 
eds claimed perot had intended to recruit from within its ranks 
in perpetuity luring away the companys best talent even 
after the noncompetition contract lapses in december 
it said perot already has raided eds of 150 to 200 employees 
including eight executives

permitting random drug tests of employees is 
going off the deep end a little bit to fight the drug crisis 
us supreme court justice antonin scalia said 
in a lecture thursday at the university of georgia school of 
law scalia called the us constitution not only the token but 
indeed the substance of what continues to bind us together as a 
people but he said the document will last only as long as it 
endures in the hearts and minds of the people 
he said the court is merely a reflection of society and its 
beliefs and he warned that opposition to drugs could erode 
peoples rights 
we are facing a particular crisis i feel we have gone off 
the deep end a little to meet that crisis scalia said 
if society continues to feel that way 50 or 60 years from now 
you are going to have justices on the court who were plucked from 
that society he said i cant save you from yourselves 
scalia a conservative named to the high court in 1986 by 
thenpresident reagan wrote a stinging dissent in a supreme court 
decision in march upholding drug testing for some us customs 
officers though in another case decided at the same time he backed 
tests for railway workers after accidents 
he was greeted at hartsfield atlanta international airport by a 
handful of antibortion demonstrators but left via a side exit 
in athens a small group favoring legal abortions stood quietly 
outside the auditorium holding a banner reading we wont go 
back

when they talk about the economic outlook these 
days many wall street analysts use a term coined in the 1970s but 
not heard much since then stagflation 
the word a hybrid of stagnation and inflation describes an 
unpleasant set of circumstances once believed to be nearly 
impossible 
in a period of stagflation economic growth is weak at best but 
inflation keeps running at the kind of rapid pace that is supposed 
to occur only in times of strong expansion 
that condition prevailed for extended periods in the 70s amid a 
series of unusual influences including a runaway rise in world oil 
prices and a couple of long and severe recessions 
the precise causes of stagflation in those days are still being 
debated but lately a more urgent question has been raised after a 
decade of strong growth and relatively low inflation is 
stagflation coming back 
most analysts believe that growth of economic activity has begun 
to slow since early this year under the influence of a sustained 
period of credittightening by the federal reserve 
shortterm interest rates at 9 percentplus stand more than 3 
percentage points higher than they were a year ago that means that 
for many borrowers the cost of money has been increased by about 50 
percent 
yet some gauges of inflationary pressures have increased 
suggesting that the cost of living is now rising at an annual rate 
in the 5 percent to 6 percent range 
despite those symptoms however most observers dont believe 
the economy is about to come down with a sustained case of 
stagflation 
recent signs of slower economic growth and an escalation of 
inflation are typical for this stage of a business cycle 
maintains jack lavery research chief at merrill lynch amp co the 
conditions for a prolonged period of stagflation appear to be 
absent 
we expect economic growth to slow on balance for the rest of 
the year the momentum of inflation should start to abate shortly 
after the economy weakens 
wright investors service inc which recently lowered its 
estimates for economic growth and corporate profits through 1990 
takes a similar view 
inflation is probably now close to its peak rate for the 
current business cycle say analysts at the bridgeport conn 
money management firm 
by next year wright says inflation is likely to set no more 
than a 4 percent annual pace even lower if the economy falls 
into a genuine recession 
at nomura securities international inc economists david resler 
and carol stone declare we attach a small probability to the 
stagflation scenario 
at its heart stagflation pertains to an environment where the 
costs of essential production inputs are rising rapidly and 
retarding productivity 
in the 1970s that condition was first triggered by the 1973 
oil embargo though oil prices have risen recently a replay of 
anything like those earlier episodes seems improbable 
a brief period of rising inflation and falling economic growth 
is more likely reduced growth may be necessary to alleviate 
strains on production capacity 
but that also eases inflationary pressures so the conditions 
of stagflation should be shortlived

representatives of peter v ueberroth today 
met with eastern airlines unions hoping to clear another hurdle in 
the proposed sale of the strikecrippled carrier the former 
baseball commissioners demand for wage and other concesssions from 
the workers 
ueberroth met informally with union officials thursday night and 
formal negotiations began today at the headquarters of the 
international association of machinists which struck the airline a 
month ago 
an iam spokeswoman said the meeting began at 930 am and was 
expected to last all day she said she did not believe ueberroth 
himself was at the session which also involves unions representing 
easterns pilots and flight attendants which have honored iam 
pickets 
the talks came a day after a group led by ueberroth agreed to 
buy strikebound eastern for about 464 million the deal would give 
easterns 30000 employees a 30 percent stake in the airline in 
exchange for about 210 million in contract concessions 
union officials said they hoped the deal could end the monthold 
walkout at the nations seventhlargest airline and get eastern 
flying a full schedule 
but some daunting hurdles remain for the deal announced by 
ueberroth and lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
easterns major creditors and the us bankruptcy court must 
approve it in addition the deal requires eastern to reach new 
work agreements with its three unions by midnight tuesday 
ueberroths group is seeking about 210 million in pay cuts and 
workrule concessions from the unions sources close to the 
situation said lorenzo had sought 125 million in concessions 
under this agreement eastern can be back flying in very short 
order lorenzo said at the news conference eastern is prepared 
to be back flying within 24 hours after agreement is reached 
with the unions 
the miamibased carrier has been virtually grounded since march 
4 by the machinists strike that was supported by pilots and flight 
attendants and drove eastern to file for bankruptcy protection and 
reorganization on march 9 
to sum it up its a mammoth challenge said ueberroth who 
organized the 1984 summer olympics in los angeles im convinced 
that there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that i can 
help bring together to help this airline 
although texas air has endorsed the ueberroth plan others still 
might submit competing proposals to the bankruptcy court 
nevertheless the ueberroth deal was greeted with cheers by 
union members who have vilified lorenzo as a union buster 
at a crowded union hall in miami members chanted hey hey 
ho ho lorenzos got to go and sang take me out to the 
ballgame as they heard of the sale 
union leaders were more cautious 
were reviewing the documents and well be making a decision 
very shortly said charles bryan head of the machinists local 
at eastern who was in washington for the talks with ueberroth 
jack bavis chairman of easterns pilots union said his group 
was encouraged by the development and looked forward to working 
with ueberroth 
in new york lorenzo told reporters that under the proposed 
purchase texas air would get about 200 million cash would be 
forgiven 185 million that it owes to eastern and would get 79 
million worth of eastern assets 
a union analysis on the other hand reckons the value of texas 
air debt owed to eastern at 2886 million the debt includes loans 
to texas air and easterns sister carrier continental airlines to 
buy gates at airports in newark nj houston and cleveland and 
for aircraft purchases 
eastern is saddled with about 32 billion in debt 
the 79 million in asset transfers which the unions have 
vocally opposed would include easterns new yorkmontreal route 
plus eight landing slots and one gate at new yorks laguardia 
airport as well as 28 million in unspecified assets 
ueberroth and partner thomas talbot a former airline executive 
from california would own 30 percent of the airline 
drexel burnham lambert inc a major investment house and 
ardshiel inc a smaller new york firm would sell securities to 
investors for the remaining 40 percent of eastern 
eastern would get a 199 percent interest in texas airs 
computer reservations system system one as well as continentals 
miamilondon route 
ueberroth said his group also would receive proceeds of 
easterns 365 million sale of its profitable northeast shuttle to 
developer donald j trump the bankruptcy court must approve that 
sale too 
lorenzo said eastern intended to file a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan that would pay creditors 100 percent lorenzo 
will remain in charge of the airline until the deal is approved 
but ueberroth will participate in formulating the reorganization 
plan 
ueberroths group made a 464 million offer for eastern last 
week but withdrew the bid after texas air said it had been topped 
by another buyer identified by sources as billionaire hotel 
executive jay a pritzker 
takeover strategist carl icahn the wner and chairman of trans 
world airlines inc has publicly expressed interest in eastern and 
gained the support of its unions but has yet to make a formal offer

the opec nations produced about 196 
million barrels of oil a day in march slightly under the level of 
february but still ahead of their output targets according to 
estimates released friday 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that estimated production by the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries slipped about 200000 barrels a day 
last month 
total output was estimated at 198 million barrels a day in 
february and 202 million barrels in january 
the opec countries agreed in november to reduce their output to 
185 million barrels a day in the first half of this year from more 
than 22 million in an effort to push up prices 
since the accord prices have rallied more than expected 
surpassing opecs target of 18 a barrel the average price of a 
basket of seven crudes monitored by opec reached 1857 a barrel 
this week 
a panel of eight opec ministers met last week in vienna and 
reaffirmed their commitment to the accord 
all 13 ministers will meet in early june to decide the output 
levels for the second half of the year observers have said the 
ministers would likely boost the production ceiling if prices held 
at their current levels 
the report by the international energy agency estimated world 
oil supply outside such centrally planned economies as the soviet 
union at 50 million barrels a day in march about the same as in 
the previous month 
the oil tanker accident off the port of valdez reduced 
production in alaskas prudhoe bay to 800000 from 2 million 
barrels a day the report said 
shipping is being resumed on a limited basis which if it 
continues should restore alaskan supplies to normal levels in the 
near future it said 
it said production in industrialized nations belonging to the 
organization for economic cooperation and development registered 
about 164 million barrels a day last month up 200000 barrels 
from february about twodozen developed nations including the 
united states belong to the oecd 
the report said oil consumption by those industrialized nations 
in the first quarter of this year was 38 million barrels a day up 
16 percent from the first three months of 1988 
in north america it said there was moderate consumption 
growth in most products with jet fuel growth very strong 
consumption increased in japan it said because of strong 
economic growth 
for all of this year the report estimated oil consumption in 
the industrialized nations would increase by less than 2 percent 
most of the gain it said would likely be in fuel used in 
transportation

inflation fears drove up interest rates and 
depressed most of the credit markets during the first quarter but 
threemonth treasury bills and junk bonds stood out among the pack 
analysts say 
a quarterly analysis by moodys investors service inc released 
this past week found that highyield highrisk junk bonds had 
the best rate of return in the januarymarch period roughly 22 
percent 
threemonth tbills had almost as good a return 21 percent 
return 
but junk bonds contain a risk of default that must be factored 
in when considering their return said john lonski a senior 
economist with the securitiesrating firm 
one would have to say that the superior performance adjusted 
for risk unquestionably belonged to the threemonth treasury 
bill lonski said 
by comparison investmentgrade corporate bonds provided a 
return of about 14 percent and longterm treasuries those of 
730 years maturity 11 percent 
a separate index of government and corporate bonds compiled by 
shearson lehman hutton inc showed a total return of 11 percent in 
the quarter 
the rate of return includes accrued interest plus any capital 
gains through price increases 
investors that fared best during the quarter followed a 
socalled barbell strategy which calls for concentrating 
investments on the two extremes of the spectrum shortterm bills 
and longterm bonds according to james l kochan chief 
fixedincome strategist for merrill lynch capital markets 
the plan paid off during the first quarter because shortterm 
rates jumped while prices of longterm bonds held up fairly well 
he said 
threemonth treasury bills yielded 839 percent on jan 3 the 
first trading day of the year on march 31 they yielded 918 
percent 
the 30year treasury yielded 908 percent on jan 3 and 909 
percent on march 31 though it fluctuated many times due to 
economic news that jolted the market 
prices and yields on bonds move in opposite directions so a 
high yield means a low price 
the situation in which the yield on the threemonth tbill 
surpasses the 30year treasury bonds yield is what wall street 
calls an inverted yield curve 
the yield curve which illustrates the difference between 
shortand longterm interest rates normally slopes upward to the 
right with longermaturing issues yielding more than shorter 
issues to reflect the risk of keeping money tied up 
but shortterm rates rose during the quarter amid concerns that 
worsening inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome 
securities would lead to further credit tightening by the federal 
reserve 
an inverted yield curve is sometimes viewed as an early warning 
of a recession because it means shorter rates have risen so high 
that they could choke off economic growth 
the inflation news during the first quarter brought concern 
among the credit markets the government reported that wholesale 
prices rose 1 percent in january and february 
since then several other governmentissued economic reports 
have indicated the economy might be slowing easing fears of 
inflation and adding a lift to the credit markets 
prices of longterm bonds have risen back to the range 
prevailing before the march 17 figures indicating a high degree of 
resiliency in the bond market kochan said 
its extraordinary really its probably performing better 
than any of us had any right to expect said kochan

president bush said today he had no 
intention of budging one inch from his minimumwage proposal as 
senate democrats moved forward with their plan to raise the base 
wage higher than bush has said he will support 
it was the second veto threat from the president in as many 
days and bushs clearest statement about the fate of the 
democratsponsored plan if it reached his desk 
we fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first 
bush said at a meeting with reporters i have no inention of 
budging one inch on this i have too much at stake 
that drew fire from one leading supporter of the senate 
democrats plan as debate on it resumed today 
dont give us a takeitorleaveit proposal said sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio thats the kind of administration 
weve had the last eight years confrontation confrontation 
confrontation 
sponsors were hoping for a final vote today but were unable to 
reach agreement with republicans meaning the debate likely will 
extend into next week amendments lowering the final minimum wage 
target to 455 from 465 and providing for a 60day subminimum 
wage for new workers were likely to be offered with the resumption 
of debate today 
sen orrin hatch of utah the republican floor leader urged 
democrats to accept bushs proposal as a compromise 
president bush has extended an opportunity to the congress to 
enact a minimum wage increase hatch said in my opinion it is 
a worthy alternative to the proposal now before us 
sen edward m kennedy dmass and chief sponsor of the senate 
bill entered into a compromise with southern democrats over the 
455 top minimum that appears to give him more than enough votes 
to win passage 
bush however appears to have the votes necessary to sustain a 
veto 
the amendments would bring the senate bill in line with a 
housepassed measure whether the bill would go straight to bush 
appears dependent on the senate provisions for the subminimum the 
proposal being discussed late thursday was slightly different from 
what is in the house bill 
the housepassed bill allows a subminimum to be paid to new 
hires for two months but only if it was their first job the 
tentative senate provision allows the subminimum to be paid to any 
worker in that workers first 60 days in the job market regardless 
of how many jobs the person held in that period both proposals 
would abolish the subminimum in october 1992 
kennedy opened the debate by saying bushs support for some 
increase was a welcome change after the reagan administrations 
dogged opposition to any boost 
eight years of stonewalling against the minimum wage are 
over said kennedy still he said bushs proposal gives too 
little protection to the nations lowwage workers 
the minimum wage has been 335 since 1981 
both the housepassed bill and the amendments kennedy promised 
to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to 385 on oct 1 
to 425 on oct 1 1990 and to 455 a year later 
bushs proposal calls for an increase to 365 on jan 1 1990 
to 395 a year later and a final jump to 425 on jan 1 1992 
the presidents measure would allow employers to pay new workers 
335 an hour for their first six months that subminimum would 
rise to 340 an hour in 1992

attempts to produce lowtech nuclear fusion which 
electrified the scientific world when announced two weeks ago have 
produced no cries of success and at least one apparent failure 
a university of utah scientist and a british colleague touched 
off a scramble when they described creating nuclear fusion in a jar 
of heavy water they said the process generated four times more 
power than it used 
if true their technique could revolutionize power production 
yielding a steady supply of cheap clean electricity but neither 
they nor anyone else has offered a convincing explanation of the 
principles of physics involved 
at massachusetts institute of technology chemist mark s 
wrighton said he obtained technical details from university of utah 
officials and started a duplicate experiment it has been going 
continuously since march 27 with no evidence of nuclear fusion he 
said thursday 
spokesmen at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
livermore cal and the los alamos national laboratory in los 
alamos nm said their attempts at duplicating the work have not 
produced conclusive results 
wrighton said he was very skeptical of the utah claim as 
was john deutch mits provost 
it would be terrific if its true but i dont think its 
true deutch said 
wrighton said his lack of results could mean that the technique 
does not work but it could also mean that the fusion is so slight 
that it cannot be detected or the reaction may need more time to 
occur 
the fusion feat was announced at a news conference by b stanley 
pons of utah and martin fleischmann of the university of 
southampton in england they claimed to have achieved nuclear 
fusion at room temperature with equipment available in any college 
lab 
late last week wrighton and several other research groups 
around the country received copies of the teams scientific paper 
which he said confirmed that he had been doing the experiment just 
as they had 
we see no physical basis at the moment for thinking that 
nuclear fusion is going to occur wrighton said and we 
certainly have no evidence that theres a big effect one that 
would have technological consequences in the near term 
pons was in meetings all day thursday and could not be reached 
for comment on the mit experiment his office said university of 
utah spokeswoman pamela fogle noted that pons and fleischmann 
believe the reaction can take 10 days to three weeks to occur 
on thursday researchers from the los alamos laboratory met with 
pons to discuss his research the deseret news in salt lake city 
reported 
utah legislators were to meet today in special session to 
consider allocating 5 million to develop and commercialize fusion 
research however the state board of regents says the funds should 
be used only when the fusion research is confirmed 
the researchers paper has been published in the netherlands in 
the journal of electroanalytical chemistry 
we realize that the results reported here raise more questions 
than they provide answers and that much further work is required on 
this topic they wrote 
wrighton said some attempts to duplicate the work began even 
before the university of utah news conference as word of the 
discovery began to leak out 
we understand through the grapevine that the groups going that 
long havent seen any confirmation of the essential claims 
either he said 
last week steven jones of brigham young university said he had 
independently performed a similar experiment last year but obtained 
far less impressive output than the utah team 
scientists at the brookhaven national laboratory in upton ny 
have tried to duplicate jones approach in two experiments one 
produced nothing and the other turned up results too small to be 
statistically meaningful spokeswoman mona rowe said thursday 
fusion is the energy source that powers the sun and hydrogen 
bombs the energy produced by nuclear power plants comes from 
fission which splits atoms during fusion they are joined 
together 
ordinarily fusion requires hundreds of millions of degrees of 
heat but pons and fleischmann said they produced fusion energy in 
a 6inch glass jar at room temperature and normal pressure their 
equipment included a sixvolt battery rods of the precious metal 
palladium and heavy water or water with deuterium

trade negotiators from more than 100 countries 
reached an agreement in principle friday on agricultural subsidies 
officials said 
informal talks resolved remaining disputes on european economic 
community farm subsidies and the issue of food security the 
officials said 
the book is closed on agriculture we have reached an 
accord chief ec farm negotiator guy legras told a press 
conference 
but he added that an enormous amount of work remains in 
continuing world trade talks under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade he predicted intense and difficult negotiations over 
the next 1 years 
the tentative accord which delegates were expected to approve 
formally later friday calls for an overall cap on farm supports 
and import barriers through 1990 legras and other officials said 
it also calls for countries to reduce their subsidies in 1990 
but does not specify by how much chief canadian negotiator germain 
denis said 
the pact meets a community demand of letting the european 
trading bloc bring up in future negotiations the issue of 
redistributing its agricultural subsidies legras said 
he said that senior officials after three days of 
gattsponsored negotiations had set clear and precise 
objectives for the remainder of the running round of world trade 
talks under gatt 
denis said a committee will meet in six months to assess 
compliance with the farm accord however violators face no 
penalties 
the issue of food security which preoccupied japan indonesia 
the nordic countries and switzerland was resolved by requiring 
negotiators to address the problem in the next 20 months denis 
said 
officials said those countries were worried that liberalized 
trade arrangements could leave them dependent on food imports 
in the other main dispute the community insisted on the right 
to redistribute its payments to farmers even while reducing their 
overall level the united states and other producer countries 
charged the european approach ran counter to the goal of 
liberalizing trade under the current set of gatt talks known as 
the uruguay round 
gatt spokesman david woods said progress also was made regarding 
trade in textiles and clothing patents and other intellectual 
property rights and safeguards or escape clauses for countries 
confronted with a sudden surge of imports 
those issues together with the clash over farm policy held up 
other agreements reached at a gatt ministerial meeting in montreal 
last december the current fouryear round of talks is due to end 
at the end of 1990

the nuclear regulatory commission today 
approved the drastic streamlining of its procedure for the 
licensing of nuclear power plants that the commissions chairman 
said could halve the current time needed to build a plant 
however chairman lando zech said he knew of no company 
interested in building a new nuclear plant no one has ordered a 
plant since 1978 and the oldest active order was placed in 1974 
the new process provides for advance approval of possible sites 
and standard plant designs and combines most of the current 
construction and operating licenses into a single license to be 
issued only after all safety issues have been resolved in 
preconstruction proceedings 
currently many issues such as evacuation planning are left 
until the operating license usually not considered until the plant 
is complete 
recent plants have taken an average of 13 years to complete 
some of that delay has resulted from suspension of construction at 
some plants for financial reasons 
after a unanimous vote by the commission to approve the new 
licensing procedure zech told reporters we should be able to 
build a plant in six years or less in this country 
the commission has long wanted a more streamlined licensing 
procedure but has been unable to persuade congress to enact one 
without new legislation the commission must still hold two 
hearings one on whether to grant the combined construction and 
operating license and the second on whether all the license 
conditions have been met 
zech said he believed the new regulations had narrowed the range 
of issues to be considered at the second hearing so much that 
legislation would not be necessary 
many analysts have pointed to the proliferation of reactor 
designs as an impediment to management training maintenance and 
construction the nations 110 licensed plants and 11 under 
construction encompass more than 60 designs 
zech said general electric corp westinghouse corp combustion 
engineering inc and the electric power research institute all have 
asked the commission staff to review versions of a current plant 
design for possible licensing

hyatt corp the hotel chain renowned for stunning 
glass atrium lobbies swank service and pricey rooms is planning 
to try its hand at luxury grouphousing for seniors 
penny pritzker member of the billionaire family that controls 
hyatt said the classic residence subsidiary she heads is part of a 
broader trend by big business to get into the fragmented but 
potentially lucrative market of residences for retirees 
classic residence was a familygenerated idea she said i 
was very much involved in it but we do things as a family 
those things include 95 us hotels and 50 abroad a chicago law 
firm casinos farmland and about 60 industrial concerns the 
pritzkers are also known for dabbling in takeover situations most 
recently the mcorp banks of texas and eastern airlines 
hyatt researchers found that the top 10 providers of 
grouphousing for seniors had less than 10 facilities each she 
said in a telephone interview from chicago where the familys 
operations are based 
its been basically a developerdriven business she said 
and in our view its a service business and thats something we 
know very well 
she predicted there eventually will be brand consolidation 
and well be able to capitalize 
our expertise in food and beverage and maid and linen service 
and our general knowledge of consumer services will give us an 
edge in the business 
hyatt is developing classic residences in dallas teaneck nj 
and reno nev scheduled to open within weeks of each other this 
summer others are under construction in riverdale ny and chevy 
chase md 
our hope is to do four or five projects a year said ms 
pritzker 
the dallas version includes an atrium a trademark of hyatt 
hotels but that is just coincidence since the building was 
purchased by the company from another developer who originally 
intended it to be a condominium said gary anderson the director 
of the 147room project 
it wont be cheap to live in one of the hyatt homes rents in 
the dallas classic residence range from 1800 to 2600 per month 
but anderson said the cost is comparable to expenses for 
maintaining a house buying groceries and paying for transportation 
therell be maids linen service 24hour security planned 
activities a library 25 meals a month and a concierge to handle 
requests 
hyatt got into the business because we think our ability 
to provide quality service as well as our brand recognition is 
something that is familiar to seniors ms pritzker said 
potential residents are individuals who have generally set 
aside some money for retirement anderson said were looking 
for the retired school teacher the guy who retired from gm 
fairly everyday people 
the idea is that seniors who have recently sold a house will 
have a large amount of cash that they can add to pensions and 
social security to afford the rent easily 
the only concern we have is the real estate market 
anderson said houses in dallas frequently sit unsold for months at 
a time a consequence of the states depressed economy 
its just a fact of doing business in texas right now 
anderson said 
he predicted hyatts classic residences will appeal to folks who 
have sufficient resources to rent out their homes and live at 
luxury facilities 
included in the rent is longterm care insurance which will pay 
residents 40 a day toward nursinghome care should they need it 
eventually anderson said the insurance combined with what 
residents already were paying in rent should cover nursing homes 
charges 
hyatt was able to buy the dallas building which is within a 
block of a nursing home and two blocks of a major dallas hospital 
for less than it could build a in a similar location he said 
hyatt has reached agreement with the nursing home to provide 
assistance to any residents who might need it in other planned 
locations a section of the residence will be set aside for people 
who need assisted living 
the teaneck project already is 25 percent to 30 percent leased 
and were very pleased with that ms pritzker said 
end advance for monday april 10

the casino control commission voted 
unanimously friday to reject elsinores atlantis casino hotel 
application for license renewal the first such denial in new 
jerseys decadeold casino industry 
commission chairman walter read said the financially troubled 
casino failed to demonstrate the financial resources business 
ability or integrity to merit an extension of its current license 
the atlantis license expires next friday 
the conclusion is inescapable read said the esa 
elsinores shore associates has not demonstrated these if we 
were to grant relicensure these standards would be rendered 
meaningless 
elsinore shore associates is atlantis parent company 
the commission now has to decide what to do next with the 
atlantis close it down or appoint a conservator 
elsinore lawyer harry levin had asked the commissioners thursday 
to grant the license with the understanding the company could meet 
standards long enough to find a buyer the casino says any chance 
of fetching a fair price would be spoiled by a closing or 
appointment of a conservator 
levin cited the owners obligations to stockholders 
employees and creditors who are owed an estimated 2 million in 
overdue payments 
it occurs to all of us that the one certain way to make 
certain all of these entities are made whole and all constituents 
are served is to allow us to dispose of this property in a normal 
orderly fashion levin said 
elsinore president jeanne hood testified earlier in the week 
that several prospective buyers have surfaced and that a sale 
likely can be completed in coming months 
but state lawyer david arrajj told commissioners thursday that 
state gaming regulators have already given the atlantis more than 
enough leeway in allowing the company to stay in business while it 
worked through bankruptcy reorganization over the last three years 
he said elsinore merely has posted more big losses and fallen 
deeper into debt he also cited the casinos admission in testimony 
that it failed on occasion to maintain the staterequired minimum 
reserve aimed at ensuring payoff on a gamblers big winnings 
this is not the mark of an applicant possessed with sufficient 
ability to justify licensure arrajj said 
he said allowing the atlantis to stay open on shaky financial 
ground would heighten the risk of organized crime and other dangers 
the state casino control act was designed to prevent 
levin took offense and said the atlantis owners and management 
have always demonstrated exemplary conduct regardless of their 
financial struggle 
anytime you have a business that goes out of business 
anytime a book gets burned its bad for everybody levin told 
reporters after thursdays hearing 
in movement on its other front elsinore argued before the 
bankruptcy court wednesday that chaos would reign if the gaming 
hall lost its license 
closing arguments came less than 24 hours after the atlantis 
owners went before federal court to seek protection from state 
action to close down the casino or appoint a conservator 
the judge denied the owners bid for immediate protection but 
did not rule out action after the commission made its decision

michael milken former head of drexel burnham 
lambert incs highyield junk bond department pleaded innocent 
friday to a wideranging federal indictment that charged him with 
turning the investment banking house into a racketeering enterprise 
milken dressed in a navy blue pinstriped suit entered his plea 
in a courtroom packed with more than 200 reporters lawyers and the 
curious 
also entering innocent pleas before us district judge kimba 
wood at federal court in manhattan was milkens brother lowell 
40 a third defendant former drexel trader bruce l newberg was 
absent due to a skiing accident and will be arraigned at a later 
date 
all three were named in a 98count federal securities fraud and 
racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury march 29 
michael milken entered the courtroom smiling and when ms wood 
asked him how he felt replied ok your honor prompting 
laughter from the standingroomonly crowd 
both milkens were released without having to post bail after 
assistant us attorney john carroll said prosecutors and defense 
lawyers had made substantial progress during talks to reach an 
acceptable bond for the defendants and their assets 
the charges seek 18 billion in forfeitures from each of the 
three defendants or their total combined earnings from 1984 to 
1987 the government reportedly had asked the three defendants each 
to post a 1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on their 
assets 
under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
act assets found to be the result of racketeering activities are 
subject to forfeiture and prosecutors could ask the judge to freeze 
the milkens assets to guarantee their availability in the event of 
conviction 
if convicted each of the three also face maximum fines of 37 
billion if convicted on either or both of the racketeering counts 
those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal 
racketeering law that is double the gains made from the 
allegedly illegal enterprise that a judge may impose 
ms wood scheduled another court session for tuesday morning at 
carrolls request to finalize bond arrangements the judge also 
scheduled newbergs arraignment for april 25 
milken 42 following his indictment took a leave of absence 
from his job as head of drexels beverly hills califbased 
highyield junk bond division where he reportedly made more than 
1 billion between 1983 and 1987 
milken widely is considered a pioneer in making the lowgrade 
securities a key source of financing for a wide range of corporate 
deals 
the racketeering indictment followed a more than twoyear 
investigation of wall streets fifthlargest investment firm was 
triggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculator

shipments of washington state apples 
increased slightly last week after losing ground for a month an 
indication consumers may be overcoming fears of a chemical scare 
that began in february an industry official said friday 
total outofstate shipments last week were 1196 million 
42pound boxes compared with 1191 million the previous week said 
bill dewitt manager of the wenatchee valley traffic association 
which tracks sales of washington apples the largest apple crop in 
the nation 
washington state shipments represent the first increase in a 
month but the numbers are still below the annual average dewitt 
said for the same week last year more than 14 million boxes were 
shipped 
figures from other big applegrowing states new york michigan 
and virginia were not available friday but dewitt said other 
states appear to reflect washingtons upturn 
i do know what theyve been doing over the last three weeks is 
comparable and i would hope they are leveling out too he said 
included in the washington state figures is a 10000box 
increase in the red delicious variety a sign that consumers are 
overcoming fears of potential health risks posed by the 
growthregulating chemical alar dewitt said 
alar is used primarily on red varieties of apples to enhance 
color and keep them on the tree longer although industry officials 
contend the chemical is used on only 5 percent of the crop 
the good news is we had considerably more red delicious 
shipped last week dewitt said the shipments have been going 
down especially on red delicious for the past four weeks or so 
this is the first turnaround weve had we hope its a sign of 
things to come 
the national alar scare has prompted apple growers to consider a 
variety of tactics to ease the drop in sales including destroying 
all alartreated apples now in storage 
however dewitt attributed the turnaround to an aggressive 
marketing campaign by apple marketers and statements by health 
officials that the amounts of alar in the fruit pose no known 
health problems 
we think were beginning to see some results from the good 
advertising by retailers he said were beginning to see the 
results of statements by the usda department of agriculture the 
surgeon general the epa environmental protection agency and the 
fda food and drug administration that there is no problem with 
the amount of alar in some of the apples now 
apple shipments reached recordhigh levels in the two weeks 
following a report in late february by the natural resources 
defense council which contended alar was a cancercausing agent 
since then shipments have fallen steadily reflecting orders made 
since the reports release 
we should be doing more april normally is a good month for 
us dewitt said we need to be up in at least the 15million 
box range for the next few weeks to really be able to get our 
apples sold 
taiwan which canceled several orders immediately after the alar 
report has begun accepting shipments of about 30000 boxes a week 
which is good for this time of year dewitt said 
while shipments of the red delicious variety fell shipments of 
the states two other major varieties nonred golden delicious and 
granny smith have been extremely good he said

the world bank likely will lend mexico 
between 15 billion and 2 billion this year that institutions 
mexico representative said friday 
marco voljc told reporters the funds will be used to develop 
infrastructure and not to bolster mexicos balance of payments and 
foreign reserves similar credits could be extended on an annual 
basis he said 
the credit will help president carlos salinas de gortaris 
government press forward with its efforts to cut net outflow of 
capital needed to revitalize mexicos stagnant economy 
salinas has sought to reduce foreign debt servicing which will 
cost about 16 billion this year and to obtain 7 billion through 
lower payments and new loans each year for the next six years 
treasury secretary pedro aspe visited washington and new york 
this week to press for an accord with creditor governments and 
banks that would slice mexicos debt servicing from 6 percent to 2 
percent of its gross national product this year 
voljc said the world bank credit would apply to development 
projects involving roads and agroindustries among other projects 
in a related development the world bank will extend a 250 
million credit to mexico for the purchase of industrial equipment 
the government newspaper el nacional reported friday 
voljc noted that the goverment still must sign a letter of 
intent with the international monetary fund that pledges additional 
economic reforms before mexicos 107 billion foreign debt can be 
restructured 
mexico has enacted drastic reforms designed to end decades of 
protectionism and force domestic industries to become competitive 
internationally the government dismantled thousands of import 
barriers after it joined the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
in 1986 
painful austerity highlighted by liquidations of stateowned 
industries and federal spending cuts has cost thousands of workers 
their jobs workers have lost more than half their buying power 
since the onset of the foreign debt crisis in 1982 
mexicos reserves which stood at a record high of 16 billion 
in april 1988 have plummeted to 7 billion according to the 
center for private sector economic studies debt servicing and the 
need to finance capital and consumer goods imports under the trade 
reforms contributed to the drain

pay to outside directors of some of the nations 
major coporations rose last year with the biggest gains reported 
in the financial services industry according to a study released 
friday 
of 909 companies surveyed by the conference board 42 percent 
increased pay for outside directors last year while only 2 percent 
cut back on compensation the remainder held roughly at 1987 levels 
according to the survey the median annual compensation to 
directors in the financial services industry jumped 16 percent to 
19800 the increase followed a year in which virtually no gains 
were seen 
however it appeared more lucrative to sit on the board of a 
manufacturing concern where the median compensation in cash and 
stock grants amounted to 24000 up 9 percent 
manufacturing companies whose annual sales top 5 billion paid 
their directors a median 40000 
the conference board said the median compensation for directors 
of service companies like department stores and hotels held at the 
1987 median level of 17600 
jeremy bacon the boards specialist in directorship practices 
said the increases for manufacturing and financial service concerns 
are large enough to suggest that there is competitive pressure 
pushing director compensation higher 
he noted that increases are deserved directors are putting in 
longer hours than ever before and making tough calls there is a 
price for that kind of service and commitment 
bacon noted that retirement plans and stock options continue to 
gain in popularity as forms of compensation last year 28 percent 
of the companies polled provided a retirement plan for outside 
directors up from 21 percent in 1987 while 14 percent had stock 
options provisions up from 9 percent in the previous year

the failure of congress to raise federal 
salaries is accelerating a brain drain of computer experts from the 
government according to a report in the forthcoming issue of 
information week magazine 
fourteen computer chiefs have left federal service in the last 
three years most of them for sales and marketing jobs with 
companies that do business with federal agencies the magazine says 
in its april 10 issue 
now that we didnt get pay raises lots will be looking i 
am reed phillips director of information resources management 
at the commerce department told the magazine 
pay for computer chiefs is sometimes as little as a third what 
people could earn in private business the magazine said the pay 
raise which was snagged by controversy over a raise for congress 
would have lifted the ceiling on senior executive pay to 125000 
from 80000 
vacancies have caused serious trouble at the internal 
revenue service and nasa according to patricia ingraham a task 
force member of paul volckers privately funded national commission 
on the public service quoted by the magazine 
other departments having trouble with vacancies are the 
department of health and human services and the topsecret national 
security agency the magazine said 
at nasa spokeswoman terri sindelar said friday the low pay 
ceiling and other factors that caused professionals to leave were 
hurting the entire agency not just computer operations this is 
undercutting the space program by causing a brain drain she said

the labor department reported that the unemployment rate 
declined to 50 percent a new 15year low in march from 51 
percent the month before that surprised analysts who had been 
looking for a small increase 
by contrast the data also showed a smallerthanexpected gain 
of 180000 in nonfarm payroll employment providing some support 
for the view that the economy has been slowing since early this 
year 
brokers said the overall result was something of a letdown 
since many investors had been hoping for a more clearcut signal 
that pressures were abating on inflation and interest rates 
but traders also apparently interpreted the data as positive for 
technology stocks which have been depressed lately by earnings 
worries and concern about a possible business slump

gasoline prices nationwide are on average sharply higher 
following last months alaskan oil spill partly because of factors 
that already were inflating prices when the disaster occurred 
an american automobile association survey released friday 
indicated retail prices for selfserve unleaded gasoline as of 
wednesday were up an average of 12 cents a gallon to 1115 since 
easter weekend march 2426 
the survey showed most of the increase occurred after the march 
24 spill which resulted in the temporary closing of the oil port 
of valdez in california unleaded gasoline has risen 11 cents in 
iowa and kentucky 15 cents and in texas more than 10 cents since 
then 
the rise in retail prices closely followed a jump in wholesale 
prices even though there generally is a lag as service station 
companies scrambled to keep up with their own costs of supply and 
ensure that they had enough gas to meet demand 
people were afraid that the crude supply would cause a 
shortage of gasoline going into the summer driving season said 
ken miller analyst with the petroleum consulting firm of purvin amp 
gertz inc in houston 
there was a fairly rapid passthrough because of the 
presumption of a fundamental shortage or a perceived fundamental 
shortage as a result of lost crude supplies miller said 
gasoline prices were headed up even before the disaster 
particularly on the west coast where inventories were low due to 
refinery slowdowns caused by mechanical problems and annual 
maintenance 
in the two weeks before the spill unleaded wholesale prices in 
los angeles had risen by more than 10 cents a gallon to an average 
of 72 cents according to data compiled by the newsletter platts 
oilgram price report 
after the march 24 spill western wholesale prices surged more 
than 28 cents due to a combination of factors including the 
temporary shutdown of oil shipments through valdez from the prudhoe 
bay fields which supply 60 percent of west coast refiners 
the perception that the spillrelated supply squeeze would 
produce shortages at the onset of the driving season also helped 
boost prices as wholesalers began stockpiling and west coast 
motorists rushed to fill their gas tanks observers said 
nationwide wholesale prices also rose pushing pump prices 
higher as expectations spread that a supply squeeze in the west 
could create higher demand for crude from the gulf of mexico and 
foreign producers which account for the bulk of the nations oil 
alaska supplies 25 percent of us oil consumption just over 
half of that amount goes to west coast refineries although states 
like texas and areas of the midwest and east coast also depend on 
alaska crude 
but price increases were more dramatic on the west coast because 
of additional refinery problems observers said 
gary king supply manager for benito tank lines a large west 
coast gasoline wholesaler said some west coast refineries were 
shut down for repair while others were operating with low 
inventories and had to scramble for supply when the prospect of an 
alaskan crude squeeze developed 
annual refinery tuneups had further reduced capacity and 
available capacity was tightened somewhat as refiners prepared 
their facilities to meet federal regulations requiring higher 
octane levels 
andrew lebow an analyst with edampf man international futures 
inc said west coast refinery capacity was down to 73 percent in 
march from 84 percent in early january 
val ferrin western supply manager for oil refinerdistributor 
flying j inc of brigham city utah said one refiner raised prices 
by 10 cents a gallon in 24 hours 
at some point in time that has to transfer to retail ferrin 
said 
further price pressure has come from the 60 percent rise in 
crude prices over the last six months as worldwide production fell 
but some observers predicted gas prices could decline once oil 
operations in alaska stabilize and as western states look to other 
suppliers for their needs 
its a shortterm situation it wont last longer than the 
next couple of weeks said king 
prices also might ease as perceptions of a shortage diminish 
the us department of energy concluded this week that the dramatic 
rise in west coast prices was caused by market psychology and 
did not warrant emergency use of the nations strategic petroleum 
reserve 
we expect prices to go back down soon said claudia barker 
spokeswoman for the california energy commission we have 
additional crude oil supplies coming in and product supplies that 
we normally wouldnt have 
california wholesalers bought 2 million barrels of gasoline from 
ecuador china and kuwait although the state normally doesnt 
import refined crude barker said 
chevron usa the west coasts largest refiner purchased 1 
million gallons of foreign gasoline on the spot market to alleviate 
possible shortfalls said mike libbey chevron spokesman in san 
franciso 
since the spill chevron has raised its wholesale price for 
unleaded gasoline by 7 cents to 77 cents a gallon libbey said

the big three automakers are beginning to set up 
the order of succession as the automotive industry heads into the 
1990s and the pictures are clearing up a little 
but theres still one question who is the oddson favorite to 
follow roger smith at general motors corp 
there were reports through the week that allan gilmour now 
executive vice president at ford motor co is on track to be 
chairman donald petersens successor in the fall of 1991 when 
petersen reaches fords mandatory retirement age of 65 
the reports said an announcement could come as early as monday 
of gilmour becoming a vice chairman ford officials decline to 
comment 
over at chrysler corp chairman lee iacoccas contract runs out 
in december 1991 and theres speculation that he would not seek 
another he would be 67 years old then 
in november chrysler shuffled its upperlevel management 
leaving gerald greenwald as vice chairman and likely successor to 
iacocca 
so far no one has emerged as the favorite follower to smith 
who turns 65 in july of next year and stands to be the first of 
the current chairmen to move aside 
theres no question at gm theres a number of people in the 
running said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co its 
just a question of exactly who 
merlis said automotive chief executive officers of the 1990s 
will have to have some specific skills 
its going to be much more international than ever before 
he said of the industry managing joint ventures is going to be 
important running europe is going to be important 
greenwald and gilmour each have work in international automotive 
operations on their resumes gilmour currently is fords executive 
vice president for international operations 
before moving to chrysler in april 1979 greenwald served as 
president or a director of ford businesses in france and venezuela 
and at the companys european headquarters 
certainly the opportunities for the ford and gm ceos of the 
90s is crossfertilization between the united states and europe 
merlis said 
merlis added that for chrysler which doesnt have the same 
presence in europe as do its two larger cousins it is how to 
take its beachhead in europe and turn it into more meaningful 
penetration 
along with international operations merlis said new ceos will 
have problems in the united states which will require some 
experience in the financial end of the carmaking business 
from september 1979 through july of 1983 greenwald was 
chryslers executive vice president for finance gilmour joined 
ford in 1960 as part of the financial staff and rose to executive 
vice president for finance in 1968 a post he held until 1972 
the real challenge will be fixing the manufacturing 
overcapacity problem merlis said its not a problem that will 
last long clearly plants will have to close and thats a challenge 
the ceos will have to face

factors but said the market got a lift from news that exxon corp 
and british petroleum inc would not curtail crude shipments to the 
west coast because of the oil spill off the alaskan coast 
in addition british petroleum announced the shutdown of an oil 
platform in the north sea for repairs 
that takes production out of the market and impacts prices 
said richard kane energy broker with merrill lynch energy futures 
crude prices also continue to gain strength from investor 
confidence that the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
is serious about reducing production 
the international energy agency in its monthly oil market report 
on friday estimated opec production for march at 196 million 
barrels a day 200000 barrels less than in february the cartel 
has cut its production by about 3 million barrels since last

companies ranging from fastfood giant 
mcdonalds corp to aircraft maker grumman corp agree they need to 
attract older workers to stave off an impending labor shortage as 
baby boomers age 
there is really no choice daniel e knowles vice president 
for human resources and planning at grumman told a national 
council on the aging seminar in new orleans recently if were 
going to increase productivity and meet the needs of an aging 
workforce were going to have to totally change the concept of 
retirement 
statisticians say the average age is rising in this country 
people in the baby boom generation have had fewer children than 
their parents and have waited longer to have children while 
medical advances have kept their parents alive longer 
meanwhile the number of people available to take jobs has 
tightened said philip rones of the bureau of labor standards 
we have 3 million fewer younger workers than we did 10 years 
ago said rones were in the middle of the nations longest 
peacetime expansion unemployment is at a 15year low 
the dearth of teenagers coupled with a tight labor market has 
prompted mcdonalds to look for older people to work as everything 
from burgerflipper to managers for its fastfood restaurants 
we recruit from our customers said stanley stein a senior 
vice president at mcdonalds corp in oak brook ill we use tray 
liners counter cards brochures 
mcdonalds emphasizes that older workers can set their own hours 
and wont work enough hours to lose social security benefits said 
stein 
participants in the conference agreed that the possible loss of 
social security or pension benefits is one of the biggest obstacles 
to keeping older workers 
when travelers insurance co set up a job bank for its own 
retired workers it also had to change restrictions that kept 
workers from collecting their pensions if they continued to work 
harold johnson former personnel director for travelers and now 
senior vice president of a company that trains executives said 
retirees can work 1000 hours a year the equivalent of six months 
without affecting their pension 
travelers calls them when it needs a temporary worker and at 
least half of the 1000 or so temporaries called in each day are 
retired from the company said johnson 
he said travelers also eliminated its mandatory retirement age 
and set up a plan for workers who wanted to continue working 
parttime rather than fulltime after the age of 65 
not every company or even a majority is worried about a 
labor shortage or looking toward older people as its solution said 
participants at the conference 
for every company that does dozens and dozens arent said 
johnson downsizing is a fact of life in american industry and 
older employees are the most affected and dozens of dozens of 
companies are still laboring under the myths that we have blown 
away 
the myths include beliefs that a workers ability deteriorates 
with age and that older workers will cost a company more in sick 
leave and medical benefits than their work is worth said 
conference participants 
laura myers mccoy a spokeswoman for days inns of america inc 
said her companys elderly workers not only have a better 
attendance rate than their younger counterparts but stay longer 
she said the corporate headquarters in atlanta loses an average of 
40 percent of its reservation agents every year 
the turnover rate among the older workers at our corporate 
office is less than 1 percent she said 
knowles said grummans highly trained workforce has always 
tended to be older than average something which itself refutes 
the belief that a younger worker is a better worker 
when we put a man on the moon 20 years ago we made the lunar 
module he said our past president told me it wasnt a bunch 
of kids who put a man on the moon it was a bunch of middleaged 
and older workers 
that wasnt a putdown of kids it was just a positive 
statement acknowledging the long services of the older guys and 
that all that service and smarts made the place tick 
knowles said the average age at grumman rose from 37 to 45 
between 1970 and 1977 when a decreasing market forced 13600 
layoffs rather than age or seniority he said the layoffs were 
based on each departments ranking of its workers from best to 
worst

arraigned 
other businessmen and colleagues promised to mount a public 
campaign against charges that milken engineered a series of illegal 
deals cited by the government in a landmark 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment against he and two others 
its hard for those who know him to square what the 
governments alleging against what we see privately said ralph 
ingersoll chairman of ingersoll publications co and a friend of 
milkens 
milken 42 is credited with helping reshape corporate america 
in the 1980s from his beverly hills calif office of drexel 
burnham lambert inc through the sale of highyield junk bonds that 
allowed small and mediumsized companies to expand rapidly and 
gave corporate raiders a ready source of financing 
he has been a target of government prosecutors for more than two 
years and is charged with defrauding clients investors and the 
public by violating securities laws supporters and defense lawyers 
claim he has been unfairly persecuted 
more than 200 reporters courtroom artists lawyers and milken 
friends packed the courtroom to hear milken and his brother lowell 
plead not guilty to all charges another 50 people were kept 
outside for lack of space 
after the arraignment dozens of supporters cheered and shouted 
good luck michael as he descended the courthouse steps shook 
some hands and was whisked away in a limousine 
supporters also rallied for milken at the beverly hilton hotel 
site of drexels annual junk bond conference in beverly hills 
a handful of fans at the manhattan courthouse wore white 
baseball caps saying mike milken we believe in you the same 
message that appeared in fullpage ads paid for by friends and 
business associates in major newspapers last week 
supporters questioned by an associated press reporter refused to 
say whether they worked for drexel which has reached a plea deal 
with the government to settle securities fraud charges 
drexel denied reports that the government told it to bar a 
planned rally by drexel employees at the court in support of milken

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca received 
about 37 million and future stock options from the nations 
thirdlargest automaker last year down from 179 million in 1987 
according to the companys proxy statement released friday 
the main reason for the big decline was that iacocca exercised 
far fewer stock options in 1988 than he did the previous year 
in 1987 iacocca exercised 135 million worth of stock options 
while stock options represented about 22 million of what iacocca 
received in 1988 
his salary benefits and earnings incentives for 1988 were only 
17 percent less than what he received the previous year 
the proxy statement is being mailed to shareholders in advance 
of chryslers annual meeting set for may 18 in san francisco 
in a statement friday uaw president owen bieber and vice 
president marc stepp head of the unions chrysler department said 
the executive salaries continue to send a message reflecting 
misplaced priorities 
there can be no possible justification for the excessive 
salaries bonuses and receipts from stock transactions reported in 
todays proxy statement bieber and stepp said in a prepared 
statement 
last year stepp called the payments announced just before the 
union and the company sat down at the bargaining table an 
incredible ripoff 
chrysler is the first of the big three automakers to release its 
1988 proxy statement ford motor co is expected to release its 
statement next week and general motors corps is due after that 
the statement said iacocca 64 received about 147 million in 
salary and 1987 incentive payments 22 million in stocks or stock 
options exercised and 12000 in company contributions to a savings 
plan 
in addition the statement said iacocca will become eligible for 
several other stock option plans at the end of 1990 and 1991 when 
iacoccas current contract expires those options if exercised 
could bring him 181 million at the end of 1990 and another

the casino control commission voted 
unanimously friday to reject a bid by elsinores atlantis casino 
hotel to stay in business despite deep financial trouble the 
firstever denial of a license renewal in new jerseys decadelong 
casino history 
commission chairman walter read said elsinore shore associates 
the casino owners failed in their twoweek hearing to demonstrate 
that they could remain financially viable to merit an extension of 
their current license which expires next friday 
five hours after the 50 vote the commission took another 
unprecedented step and appointed a state conservator to run the 
atlantis until it can be sold 
the move at least temporarily ensured that the casino would stay 
open and the 2100 employees would keep their jobs despite the 
license expiration on april 14 
read referring to testimony by elsinore vice president bruce 
mckee scolded the company for shoddy operations and dubious 
financial projections 
mr mckee said that he would prefer not to call the licensee a 
seat of the pants operation read said before moving for the 
license denial but it is clear from figures regarding cash 
position and overdue payables that it is precisely that 
the casino which emerged from bankruptcy reorganization last 
september has posted losses each of the last four years including 
a whopping 75 million in 1988 it also has failed consistently to 
meet the financial projections upon which its previous license 
renewals were based read noted 
elsinore president jeanne hood said she was overwhelmed by 
the commission action she collected more than 352000 in salary 
and bonuses last year and the casinos past due bills approached 
2 million ms hood said she was most anxious to keep the 
atlantis open for the sake of the employees 
elsinore admitted during the hearing it could not show the 
financial wherewithal to stay in business and meet state standards 
for the entire twoyear license period instead the companys 
lawyers asked the commission to be flexible and let the casino stay 
in business long enough to sell out 
but read said to do so would compromise the credibility of the 
states vigorous casino regulations and heighten the risk of 
unethical conduct by the casinos strapped management read cited 
testimony by mckee acknowledging that the casino on occasion failed 
to maintain the staterequired minimum in its reserve to pay off 
winnings 
the conclusion is inescapable that if we were to grant 
relicensure these standards would be rendered meaningless read 
said 
anthony parrillo director of the division of gaming 
enforcement called it a somber day for the casino but hailed 
the denial as the right move for the health of new jerseys gaming 
industry 
if the case shows anything it shows that regulatory 
credentials have to predominate over economic consequences he 
said 
the commissioners admitted the conservator issue was unexplored 
territory fraught with hazards and despite the 41 vote for 
conservatorship the commissioners delayed until next week the 
decision of who the conservator would be and what powers one would 
possess it was unclear how the arrangement would affect efforts to 
sell the casino 
there are so many questions that have to be answered it could 
really be a fiscal minefield commissioner frank dodd the lone 
dissenter told reporters earlier in the day he said it might be 
preferable to padlock the casino 
another possible outcome is protection from the bankruptcy 
court where elsinore first turned in 1985 
company lawyers earlier in the week urged a federal bankruptcy 
court in camden to intervene and keep the atlantis in business the 
judge declined immediate action but agreed to consider the matter 
next tuesday 
in the commission hearing elsinore claimed the best hopes for 
the casinos creditors rested with a decision to keep the casino 
open under the current ownership the casino said any chance of 
fetching a fair selling price would be spoiled by a closing or 
appointment of a conservator 
mrs hood testified earlier in the week that several prospective 
buyers have surfaced and that a sale likely could be completed in 
coming months

a federal judge said friday he plans to deny a 
request to dismiss securities fraud charges against singer co 
chairman and takeover specialist paul a bilzerian 
us district judge robert j ward also said at a hearing that 
he would refuse to move the case scheduled for a trial beginning 
may 1 to federal court in tampa fla where bilzerian lives 
the judge indicated he would drop one of 12 counts in an 
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury last december but 
said he would not make a formal ruling on any of the matters until 
tuesday 
bilzerian 38 is accused of violating securities and tax laws 
conspiracy and making false statements to the government in 
connection with four securities transactions in 1985 and 1986 
the government contends that bilzerian made millions of dollars 
by accumulating stock in takeover targets concealing ownership of 
the stocks in secret accounts and then selling his holdings after 
the stock price had risen 
much of the governments case is derived from information 
supplied to the government by los angeles broker boyd l jefferies 
who has admitted to two felonies for violating federal securities 
laws 
jefferies also supplied information for the governments stock 
manipulation case against gaf corp which ended in a second 
mistrial last month 
bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a 
250000 fine on each count

nwa inc parent company of northwest 
airlines on friday rejected a 262 billion bid by los angeles 
billionaire marvin davis to acquire the airline concern but davis 
vowed to continue his efforts 
the nwa board based its decision on advice from its financial 
adviser that davis 90ashare offer was inadequate the board 
reaffirmed its intention to maintain the airline as an independent 
entity 
our board has carefully considered mr davis proposal as well 
as numerous other financial and strategic alternatives available to 
nwa it is clear that mr davis proposal does not fully reflect 
the value of nwa said steve rothmeier chairman and chief 
executive officer of nwa 
davis whose bid was set to expire april 21 has insisted his 
bid is friendly and that he would not sell off parts of the company 
we have a strong serious interest in owning nwa in that 
regard we are in the process of completing financing arrangements 
for the acquisition and expect to be in a position to describe them 
shortly a spokesman for davis jim fingeroth said after the nwa 
board rejected davis bid 
the boards decision was announced after the stock market 
closed in trading on the new york stock exchange nwa fell 50 
cents a share to close at 8875 on friday 
davis announced his bid about a week ago several days after nwa 
disclosed that an investor group whose identity has still not been 
revealed had a 49 percent stake in the company 
in the nwa statement rothmeier said northwests value is 
demonstrated by recent federal airline performance statistics and 
the companys expectations for earnings growth 
first according to us department of transportation 
statistics our airline achieved excellent ontime and customer 
satisfaction during the last quarter second we expect nwas 
firstquarter earnings to be at record levels rothmeier said in 
a statement 
our confidence in nwas potential is combined with a 
realization that our shareholders employees and customers are just 
beginning to see the benefits of our acquisition of republic he 
said in light of these considerations the board has concluded 
that it is not appropriate to seek a sale of nwa 
kurt rivard an analyst for dain bosworth inc in minneapolis 
said nwas anticipated record firstquarter earnings would make a 
90 a share offer inadequate and will figure significantly in 
future takeover discussions 
this sets a basis for a reevaluation of earnings estimates up 
and given that it would make the premium that would someone would 
have to pay to acquire the company higher rivard said 
northwest has not made money in the first quarter since 1985 
and the reason for that is the airline business especially for an 
international carrier is very seasonal yields are also weak 
during that period he said 
davis intends to proceed aggressively said fingeroth who is 
with the new york public relations firm of kekst and co 
we are disappointed that the board has rejected this very 
generous offer without even exploring it with us especially in view 
of our expressed willingness to consider a higher price if 
additional value can be demonstrated he said 
in washington rep james oberstar dminn told reporters that 
in a meeting he held earlier friday with davis the wouldbe 
purchaser described his financial plan to him and that he believed 
the suitors proposal was a very attractive offer 
the lawmaker said despite the rejection by the nwa board the 
proposal was one that would not burden the airline with an 
unacceptable debt load 
oberstar said davis had told him it would be financial folly 
to sell any of the carriers assets that he would not seek salary 
or benefit concessions from employees and that he would establish 
a major maintenance facility in minnesota for the europeanmade 
airbus aircraft northwest is purchasing 
the maintenance base would provide 1000 to 1500 jobs the 
legislator said 
according to oberstar davis will meet soon with northwest union 
leaders 
oberstar said davis would reveal the details of his financial 
plan to the public next wednesday the lawmaker said making the 
plan public might help davis because nwa board had not yet seen the 
specifics of his financing 
the congressman said he was not endorsing davis offer but he 
added this is a very attractive offer and we ought to think 
about it very seriously 
oberstar chairman of the house aviation subcommittee said he 
met with the nwa suitor aboard davis boeing 727 jet at the airport 
in nashville tenn oberstar who said he inititated the meeting 
had traveled to nashville to address a convention

the pittston co said it continued to 
operate most of its virginia and west virginia coal mines thursday 
the first full day of a strike by 1400 members of the united mine 
workers union 
pittston co spokeswoman susan copeland said that the company 
would not release details about which facilities were working 
we are operating most of them copeland said theyre not 
all up to par but they will be but we wont be outlining which 
operations we are operating and which we are not 
the umw said members of 22 local unions were called out on 
strike at 4 pm wednesday pittston operations in kentucky and 
some small operations in virginia and west virginia were not 
included in the work stoppage umw spokesman joe corcoran said that 
may change 
some 1700 miners in the three states have been working without 
a contract for 14 months since the 1984 national agreement expired 
on jan 31 1988 
corcoran said the union would like pittston to reconsider its 
plan to bring in replacements for the strikers he said he was not 
hopeful that they would 
its very easy to take advantage of the unemployment in 
appalachia corcoran said it seems theyd just as soon pit an 
unemployed miner against another miner on strike they dont care 
negotiations are due to resume in washington next week

winstonsalem nc ap a state judge issued an order friday 
blocking the acquisition of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co but rjr officials said he later limited his ruling 
to the companys assets in switzerland 
forsyth county district court judge james harrill jr issued the 
restraining order and set an april 17 hearing on a motion by swiss 
investors to block the merger 
harrill granted the order in connection with a suit filed in 
switzerland that charges the buyout hurt investors by improperly 
diminishing the value of rjr nabisco bonds 
later friday an rjr nabisco spokeswoman said the judge had 
clarified his order 
the north carolina courts clarified order holds that in light 
of a prior modification to the march 20 order by the civil court in 
basel switzerland the north carolina order does not prohibit the 
merger of rjr nabiscos assets located outside switzerland said 
spokeswoman pauline howes 
in essence they narrowed the scope of the order 
considerably she said it now applies only to assets located 
inside the country of switzerland 
rjr nabisco officials said they did not believe the court action 
would have any impact on the closing of the deal 
the record 2453 billion acquisition is expected to be 
finalized some time after an rjr nabisco shareholders meeting 
scheduled for april 27 the exact date of the closing is not yet 
known 
the swiss suit is one of several claiming the buyout 
significantly reduced the value of rjr nabisco bonds 
at least three insurance companies including jeffersonpilot 
corp metropolitan life insurance co and the insurance 
subsidiaries of itt corp have sued the company claiming the 
market value of bonds they held fell 20 percent after former 
company chairman ross johnson proposed a leveraged buyout in 
october 
johnsons proposal started the bidding war eventually won by 
kohlberg kravis roberts
