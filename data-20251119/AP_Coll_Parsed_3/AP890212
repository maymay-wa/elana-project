angola said its troops killed 40 south 
african soldiers who crossed the border violating a regional peace 
agreement the angolan news agency angop reported sunday 
the marxist government protested to south africa about the 
incident that also left seven angolan soldiers dead said the report 
monitored in lisbon 
the pretoria government rejected the charge and requested an 
immediate meeting of a commission monitoring the peace accord to 
discuss the matter 
the angolan defense ministry statement issued saturday said south 
african troops on wednesday crossed into angola from neighboring 
namibia in support of angolan rebels angop reported 
the angolan government troops drove the south africans back to 
the namibian frontier after heavy fighting that ended early friday 
angop reported it said 40 south african soldiers were 
in pretoria the south african foreign affairs department said it 
replied in the strongest terms to the allegations contained in a 
protest note sent by angolas government 
in the statement sunday south africa said it was on standby to 
attend an urgent meeting of the monitoring commission in luanda the 
angolan capital to discuss angolas allegations 
the us state department said last week it had no evidence that 
any south african troops entered angola 
south african military authorities say their forces are strictly 
observing the usbrokered peace agreement signed in december the 
agreement bars south african military aid to the antimarxist rebels 
in angola and calls for independence of namibia from south african 
control 
the peace accord established a joint commission comprised of 
south african cuban and angolan representatives to monitor 
observance of the various provisions 
as part of the peace agreement about 50000 cuban troops were to 
withdraw from angola where they have been helping the government 
fight the rebels belonging to the national union for the total 
independence of angola 
the rebel group rejects the peace accords and has vowed to 
continue fighting until the angolan government agrees to share power 
the area where the fighting reportedly took place is near a 
stretch of the border between angola and namibia which does not have 
monitoring posts called for in the peace agreement 
the rebels said saturday that 275 government soldiers died in 
heavy fighting last week when 4000 guerrillas clashed with the 
angolan army in southern cuando cubango province 
the rebels denied south african troops participated in the 
fighting

a former us marine says he was coerced into 
signing a confession admitting he was a spy but the government 
maintains that arnold bracy is a liar who gave away secrets for sex 
while in moscow cbs news reports 
in an interview to be aired sunday on the networks 60 
minutes program bracy of new york told correspondent mike 
wallace that he was forced to sign a confession and that naval 
investigators knew it was false 
as i said the things that they put in that statement that they 
accused me of doing i know never happened bracy said 
the government had just uncovered a spy for sex scandal in moscow 
in 1987 when bracy was interrogated in the confession which he 
later recanted he admitted a sexual relationship with a russian 
cook at the us embassy in moscow he also confessed to allowing 
kgb agents roam in the us embassy 
in the cbs interview bracy denied that he slept with the russian 
woman and said he never allowed kgb agents into the embassy bracy 
at one time faced a military courtmartial but all charges were 
dropped when military lawyers concluded they did not have any 
corroborating evidence to prosecute 
he was discharged from the marines last spring 
ron kessler a former washington post reporter and the author of 
a new book on the moscow spy scandal also was interviewed by 
wallace 
kessler said bracy allowed kgb agents into the embassys computer 
nervecenter where they planted electronic listening devices as a 
result kessler contends that 25 soviet citizens who worked for the 
cia were exposed and later executed 
bracy denied the charge saying he did not have access to the 
computer room 
but jim pender a naval investigative service agent who 
interrogated bracy told cbs he is convinced that bracy was a spy 
for the soviets while stationed in moscow 
its my feeling that bracy has been a liar all his life

a federal judge has dismissed payola charges 
against a san franciscoarea record promoter saying the counts in 
the muchpublicized justice department investigation were too vague 
us district judge pamela rymer in response to a defense 
motion on friday dismissed three misdemeanor payola counts against 
ralph tashjian of san mateo on the grounds the grand jury 
indictment wasnt specific enough to allow the promoter to defend 
himself 
court documents showed tashjian was charged with making regular 
undisclosed payments or distributions of cocaine to program 
directors so the records he was promoting would be added to radio 
station play lists 
prosecutor richard stavin a special attorney for the los angeles 
organized crime strike force said the government next week plans to 
charge tashjian with 200 individual counts of payola 
stavin attributed the dismissal to a weakness in the payola 
statute that addresses only specific incidents and doesnt 
contemplate a scheme or ongoing course of action 
tashjian and his wife are set to stand trial later this month on 
separate felony tax evasion charges stemming from the payola case 
reacting to the judges ruling tashjians attorney anthony p 
brooklier said the problem was the government charged my client 
with multiple offenses over a long period of time without specifying 
the dates of those alleged offenses or the records involved 
the tashjians along with another record promoter and a former 
radio station manager were indicted in february 1988 after the 
internal revenue service conducted a twoyear investigation under 
the direction of the organized crime strike force charges against 
the other defendants were pending

communist party chief milos jakes 
warned in a report published saturday that opposition forces are 
resorting to psychological terror against socialists 
jakes and party ideologist jan fojtik maintaining a hard line 
against dissidents made clear that the prague leadership is not 
prepared to listen to the charter 77 human rights movement or other 
independent groups 
various groups try to rally as an opposition and their 
actions are widely backed and assisted from the west jakes was 
quoted saturday by the ctk news agency as saying 
he alleged that the us governmentfunded radio free europe and 
voice of america and others directly participate in organizing 
antisocialist forces 
jakes said foes of the system are moving from covert action to 
attempts at open confrontation including psychological pressure 
intimidation and even psychological terror against people who hold 
the positions of socialism 
he apparently referred to 80 anonymous terrorist letters and 
calls the party daily rude pravo allegedly received some of them 
reportedly wishing communist leaders to be hanged on lamp posts 
jakes also expressed the leaderships concern over a petition 
signed by more than 1000 prominent artists and intellectuals 
calling for the release of jailed dissident and playwright vaclav 
havel 
the party chiefs toughly worded remarks contrasted with the 
official stands on nonconformists in neighboring hungary and poland 
hungarys parliament last month approved formation of independent 
political groups and polish authorities are negotiating with the 
outlawed solidarity free trade union on trade union freedom and 
other reforms 
we are not calling for dialogue with everybody only with those 
who are willing to contribute to the solution of the problems of our 
society fojtik was quoted as saying we wont have dialogue 
forced upon us by those who want to judge our problems from the 
positions of the defeated reaction in feburary 1948 when the 
communists took power 
according to ctk jakes lashed out at activities of illegal 
religious structures and of some church representatives and their 
efforts to misuse the religious feelings of part of the believers 
against socialism 
czechoslovak catholic cardinal frantisek tomasek in recent 
letters to the regime has sharply criticized police violence in 
breaking up peaceful demonstrations in prague and called for a 
conciliatory official stance 
also jaroslav cejka chief editor of the czechoslovak communist 
partys cultural weekly tvorba cejka has been fired apparently for 
criticizing a report on a meeting with cultural figures carried by 
the party daily rude pravo 
reporting on a politburo session friday ctk said cejka was 
relieved of his post and was entrusted with other duties a 
customary cliche for being dismissed 
the surprising ouster came only two days after cejka criticized 
rude pravo in tvorba wednesday for not doing a very good job 
covering a discussion between politburo member miroslav stepan and a 
delegation of cultural figures 
the meeting was apparently brought about by the artists petition

hundreds of calls to the police and fire 
departments 911 emergency number went unanswered saturday because 
of a technical problem that knocked out the system for more than 
four hours 
authorities said they plan to investigate whether the outage the 
first in the 911 systems five years of operation resulted in 
injury death or fire damage that could have been avoided had the 
system been working properly 
at this point we just dont know said police capt forrest 
lewallen i can say that this is a very serious problem it is 
something that quite obviously well have to find remedies to ensure 
that it never happens again 
the problems began at 1 pm when equipment that allows the 
police department to transfer calls to the fire department stopped 
working said lissa zanville a spokeswoman for pacific bell which 
operates the system 
the equipment failure created a backlog that allowed only one in 
five calls to reach a 911 operator at the central communications 
center in los angeles where all 911 calls within city limits are 
directed she said 
from 3 to 340 pm the system went down entirely and no calls 
got through by 514 pm pacific bell technicians had the system 
working again ms zanville said 
the number of calls that went unanswered was unknown but the 
system normally handles 5000 to 7000 calls a day and a fourhour 
breakdown would easily have left hundreds of calls unanswered said 
lewallen 
not all of those unanswered calls would be emergencies lewallen 
said that about 75 percent of the 4 million calls dialed each year 
on 911 are emergencies with the rest usually nonemergency calls or 
pranks 
the sheriffs department and the county fire department which 
dont operate on the citys communications system were unaffected 
by the outage authorities said

former gov jerry brown began what he said 
could be a political comeback saturday night by winning the 
previously obscure california democratic party chair 
brown defeated steve westly a party official unknown to the 
general public 1554762 in voting by some 2300 delegates at the 
partys annual convention 
browns bid to return to the public arena overshadowed other 
events at the convention including speeches by most of the major 
contenders for the democratic nomination for governor in 1990 and 
the addresses of 1988 presidential hopefuls richard gephardt and 
jesse jackson 
the twotime candidate for president picked the race as the 
vehicle to end the sixyear selfimposed political exile which 
began after he concluded his two terms as governor with a losing 
campaign for the us senate 
brown 50 once dubbed gov moonbeam by his critics spent 
part of that exile in seclusion writing in mexico and japan part 
working mother teresas hospital in calcutta india and part on a 
care hunger project in bangladesh 
brown readily confirmed friday that if he won the chairs office 
he would probably seek higher offices in the future but if he lost 
it would be the most embarrassing and possibly the final loss of 
his public career 
brown said he was confident of victory in saturdays vote but 
his opponent current vice chair westly of menlo park said he 
surveyed more than half of the voting delegates and found brown 
leading by only 556 to 525 with 585 undecided 
in speeches to the delegates saturday brown promised to 
mobilize the millions and millions of nonvoters to rejoin the 
political process 
you will not see my face on the cover of time magazine 
westly 33 an investment banker and longtime party volunteer told 
the delegates but i have a different strength i get the job 
done 
brown wrapped up a threemonth campaign for the post with 
endorsements from most of the states most prominent democratic 
politicians including us sen alan cranston assembly speaker 
willie brown and state senate president pro tem david roberti 
but at least two dozen democratic officeholders and county 
chairmen publicly opposed brown contending that his presence as 
official head of the party would breathe new life into republican 
attacks against the most controversial events of his governship from 
1975 through 1982 and be a liability for democratic candidates in 
1990 
the bid for the obscure post of party chair by a former governor 
was unprecedented in california politics and it overshadowed all 
other business of the threeday democratic state convention that 
started friday 
in an appearance friday before the sacramento press club brown 
described his 150000 campaign as his reentry into politics and a 
possible stepping stone back to higher office but he repeated his 
pledge that if elected he wouldnt seek any higher office until his 
term as chair is completed 
im not running for anything in the next four years brown 
said adding that obviously i dont intend it to be my terminal 
position in politics but where i go next or where im invited to 
go next will depend completely on the success of what ive embarked 
upon here 
brown said that as chairman he would devote his full attention to 
party fundraising building local committees and clubs and party 
registration and getoutthethe vote drives 
he conceded that he often ignored the party while governor and 
that the nutsandbolts administrative duties of state chair are 
exactly the things he tended to neglect as governor but he said his 
priorities are different now 
there has been a lot of discussion about my administrative 
ability ive thought a lot about that over the last six years and 
its true a good manager requires doing things in a very 
structured manner which is certainly not my natural inclination 
he said changes in state laws giving the party more influence and 
the need to reverse declining voter participation trends to 
revitalize the democratic party all make the chairs job more 
important and challenging

the norths official korean central news agency said the firing 
gravely threatened the safety of the civilian policemen of our

the still unsolved bombing of pan am flight 103 
over scotland has brought more stringent security for us airlines 
congressional inquiries and a move to increase international efforts 
against air terrorism 
although tight airport security has all but eliminated hijackings 
in the united states the dec 21 bombing of the boeing 747 that 
killed 259 people en route to new york and 11 more on the ground 
raises the spectre of a more deadly kind of air terrorism 
it also raises questions about how to respond to the more than 
900 threats against us airlines each year including when to warn 
the public 
federal aviation administration officials told two congressional 
committees last week that airlines have greatly increased security 
measures for foreign flights since the bombing of flight 103 
all checked baggage is xrayed passengers are denied any access 
to baggage after checkin passengers are matched with bags to guard 
against unaccompanied baggage additional measures prevent 
unauthorized access to luggage or planes and more passengers are 
subjected to random enhanced screening with suitcases actually 
opened by inspectors 
we will not hesitate to tilt the balance toward improved 
security and away from convenience when that is necessary to protect 
our citizens faa administrator allan mcartor told one of two 
congressional hearings last week 
he indicated those measures and others which airlines will not 
discuss have brought little complaint 
but airline officials and members of congress want the increased 
security imposed on foreign carriers flying into the united states 
as well the air transport association which represents us 
carriers estimates that 50 percent of international travel by us 
citizens is on foreign airlines 
beefing up security only for us carriers would be like having 
policemen patrol only odd numbered streets said richard f lally 
association vice president for security 
raymond a salazar faa director for civil aviation security 
told the house foreign affairs committee that us airlines are 
considered the major target for terrorists and that attempting to 
impose unilateral restrictions on foreign carriers could start an 
air war 
but transportation secretary samuel skinner hopes to reach a 
consensus on international security measures at this weeks special 
meeting of the 33member council of the international civil aviation 
organization in montreal the united states and great britain called 
for the meeting to discuss steps to take following the pan am 
bombing 
in addition to us inability to control foreign airlines and 
airports authorities trying to combat terrorist attacks against 
airliners face weapons that xrays cant detect and threats that 
often come from sources they cant identify 
at least two devices are under development that can detect 
plastic explosives such as those investigators believe were planted 
in luggage aboard flight 103 
one is an explosive vapor detection system that checks people for 
explosives faa officials say preliminary tests were conducted at 
bostons logan airport but it is still in the testing stage 
the faa has already tested and used two 1 million thermal 
neutron analysis machines at california airports and has ordered 
six more airline officials say the units should be sent right away 
to highrisk airports in europe and the middle east the faa has 
identified 73 airports which it considers the most vulnerable to 
terrorism 
rep stephen solarz dny has asked the faa to determine how 
many machines would be needed for critical airports how much they 
will cost and who ought to pay for them 
in another congressional inquiry rep cardiss collins dill 
chairwoman of the government operations transportation subcommittee 
which plans hearings on flight 103 next month has asked the faa to 
provide details of its procedures for warning of threats against 
aviation 
in letters last week to the faa and pan am collins asked for 
documents relating to a telephone threat received by the us 
embassy in helsinki against pan am flights from frankfurt to new 
york two weeks before flight 103 was destroyed the state department 
says the threat was a hoax and no public warning was made but a 
notice disclosing the threat was posted on the moscow embassy 
bulletin board eight days before the explosion 
l paul bremer ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism told 
congress the notice should not have been posted and said the 
government has a policy of not issuing such warning unless they are 
also made to the general public 
he said if warnings were issued for every threat it could 
cripple commercial aviation 
but survivors of flight 103 victims in a statement last week 
said passengers should be provided on request details of any 
threat against a flight they plan to take

americans overwhelmingly support washingtons 
overtures to the palestine liberation organization but are deeply 
suspicious of the plo and dubious of its claim to have abandoned 
terrorism according to a national poll 
only 6 percent of those interviewed in the media 
generalassociated press survey said they believed the plos recent 
renunciation of terrorism while 74 percent said the group just made 
that claim for political gain the rest were unsure 
respondents were split on whether the plo would coexist with 
israel or sought to destroy it and a strong majority said other 
groups could represent the palestinian people 
still the distrust was tempered by the desire for an end to the 
mideast conflict a majority said israel should negotiate with the 
plo although most said the united states should not force it to do 
so 
the survey also found some frustration with israels support 
groups in the united states with 35 percent saying they had too 
much influence on us policy twenty percent said propalestinan 
groups had too much influence 
the poll was conducted among 1162 adults jan 412 following 
plo leader yasser arafats statement recognizing israel and 
renouncing terrorism israel rejected the move as a ploy but the 
united states responded by opening its first talks with the plo 
sixtyseven percent approved of usplo talks with the rest 
split between disapproval and no opinion support was highest among 
collegeeducated americans with eight in 10 approving 
respondents moreover endorsed a major tenet of the palestinian 
cause sixtytwo percent said the palestinians should have their own 
country just 11 percent said no and 27 percent had no opinion 
roughly a quarter of the respondents had no view on many of the 
questions posed reflecting the distance of mideast issues from the 
daily concerns of many americans significantly more men expressed 
opinions than did women 
the mosteducated respondents those with postgraduate 
educations were more likely to favor dealings with the plo while 
62 percent overall said israel should negotiate with the plo for 
example that swelled to 79 percent of the mosteducated group 
also 60 percent of the mosteducated group said israel should 
allow the creation of a palestinian state on territory it now 
occupies in exchange for recognition from the plo among all 
respondents just 44 percent agreed 
but the share of respondents who believed the plo has given up 
terrorism remained low in all groups peaking at just 11 percent of 
the mosteducated onethird overall thought the plo wants to 
destroy israel about a third believed the plo would coexist with 
israel and the last third werent sure 
more of the mosteducated group 55 percent said the plo would 
coexist with israel but six in 10 of that group and five in 10 
overall said the united states should not recognize the palestinian 
state the plo declared in november the rest were split between 
support for recognition and no opinion 
israel has said that it will not negotiate with the plo because 
the plos charter calls for israels destruction but that it would 
negotiate with other representatives of the palestinians other arab 
nations however have declared the plo the only legitimate 
representative of the palestinians 
in the survey 63 percent said some group other than the plo 
could represent the palestinians in negotiations with israel and 
nearly seven respondents in 10 said the united states should not try 
to force israel to negotiate with the plo by threatening sanctions 
the survey had a threepoint margin of sampling error

the pilot of a taiwanese fighter jet that crashed 
in china said on staterun television sunday he had planned the 
flight and taiwan newspapers claimed he carried military secrets to 
the communists 
a local chinese television station broadcast an interview with 
lt col lin xianshun 35 who parachuted to safety saturday morning 
180 miles north of canton capital of southeastern guangdong 
province 
lin said he flew the f5e jet fighter to china of his own free 
will he also said none of his family knew about his plans he did 
not elaborate 
none of the chinese reports made clear whether lin requested 
asylum in the past the state media always have given prominent 
coverage to military defectors from taiwan 
chinas nationally televised news said sunday night that lin had 
been warmly welcomed by officers from chinas air force after 
his plane crashed into a rice paddy reportedly after running out of 
oil 
it showed lins mangled jet and of lin shaking hands with chinese 
air force officers it said he was treated in a hospital for slight 
injuries 
earlier reports from china and taiwan said lin wanted to find his 
relatives in china 
a china news service report said he had asked chinese authorities 
to find an uncle lin yuyi 
but authorities have yet to find the uncle said an official 
at the state news agency in canton contacted by telephone from 
beijing 
in taiwan a relative of the pilot said he believed lin defected 
to china to see his grandmother 
the relative who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity 
said lin complained that military officers were banned from visiting 
china 
in 1987 the nationalist government eased a ban to allow all 
taiwanese except military and government personnel to visit china 
in taiwan the liberal independence evening post quoted 
unidentified sources as saying lin took several important 
documents about the strength of taiwans air force to china it 
said he took the documents from his squadron which trained selected 
pilots as enemy forces during mock air battles 
the masscirculation china times express said lin might reveal to 
the chinese a military blueprint for the defense of eastern taiwan 
from possible chinese attacks defense ministry officials refused 
comment on the reports 
taiwans state broadcasting corporation reported authorities have 
taken lins wife daughter and son to chihhang air base for 
questioning 
more than a dozen taiwanese air force officers have sought asylum 
in china and 19 chinese military personnel have defected to taiwan 
since 1949 when the nationalists lost a civil war to communist 
forces on the mainland

writing 10 years ago jack kemp said the 
department of housing and urban developments programs are 
consistently misguided and scandalous 
kemp who took over last week as the new secretary of that 
department is getting his chance to improve those programs or what 
survives of them after a decade of pressure on domestic spending 
the former new york congressman comes to hud at a time when the 
problems it deals with have gained heightened visibility the 
nations homeless population is growing and increasingly includes 
families unable to afford or obtain housing according to surveys 
conducted by the nations bigcity mayors 
kemp and president bush have both acknowledged the problem of 
homelessness 
kemp who offered the harsh description of hud in his 1979 book 
an american renaissance last month called homelessness a 
national tragedy of appalling proportions he pledged new 
spending and last week bush included increases for emergency 
shelters in his new budget proposal 
but both also have stressed that there are limits to what the 
federal government will attempt on homelessness and housing and 
advocates of urban programs are watching kemp closely for evidence 
he will back up his enthusiastic talk about innovation and new ideas 
hes not got a good record but he has made very positive 
statements about homelessness lately and he has recognized 
homelessness is a major scandal that has to be addressed said 
maria foscarinis washington counsel for the national coalition for 
the homeless 
now the question is will he come through she said 
after a swearingin ceremony by bush at huds offices monday the 
new secretary plans to begin visiting inner cities starting tuesday 
with a trip to atlanta 
mayor andrew young will lead him on a tour of housing projects 
and to meetings with publichousing tenants including one at the 
martin luther king jr center said sandra walker youngs press 
secretary 
the atlanta visit is a logical one for kemp who frequently 
quotes the late civil rights leader the center if named after and 
actively sought black support as an unsuccessful rival to bush for 
the gop presidential nomination that outreach to blacks is a goal 
of the republican party under bush and as secretary of hud kemp is 
in a position to aid that cause 
kemp is a conservative republican who speaks forcefully of 
empowering the poor by encouraging the creation of more private jobs 
rather than more federal spending urban advocates some openly 
saying they want to educate him about the need for more federal 
spending have invited him to visit other cities too 
were convinced that mr kemp will change after seeing 
programs firsthand said richard y nelson jr executive director 
of the national association of housing and redevelopment officials 
although there is wide disagreement over just how many people are 
homeless in the country urban advocates are convinced the problem 
is growing the us conference of mayors in a survey of 27 major 
cities concluded last month that the problem increased in nearly 
all those cities during 1988 and that in twothirds of them people 
were turned away because shelters were full 
the mayors also found that one in four homeless people were 
children 
to deal with the emergency cases bush proposed 144 million in 
new spending in his fiscal 1990 budget including full funding of 
the mckinney act passed by congress providing temporary shelter 
the budget however includes no money for additional units of 
subsidized permanent housing for low income people beyond the level 
of former president reagans proposal spending for housing programs 
declined some 80 percent during the reagan years and a dwindling 
supply of affordable housing is what mayors cite as the major cause 
for homelessness 
shelters are not the answer boston mayor raymond l flynn 
said permanent affordable housing that is the answer 
like reagan bush would rely heavily on use of housing vouchers 
which are certificates for subsidy that renters use as partial 
payment of their rents but critics say those dont help a family 
find housing when no affordable units are available and that hud 
under reagan virtually stopped subsidizing the construction of new 
affordable housing units 
vouchers work in some housing markets but when the units 
arent there vouchers dont get you anywhere foscarinis said 
her organization is backing a bill introduced in the house that 
would provide 2 billion to fix up vacant housing units and backers 
say eventually house 1 million people so far she says the group 
is still waiting to hear from kemp

the prospect of the soviet unions mikhail 
gorbachev and chinas deng xiaoping shaking hands at their upcoming 
summit is causing surprisingly little anxiety in washington 
several years ago reports of highlevel chumminess between the 
two communist giants would have caused sleepless nights among us 
officials wary of a renewed military and political pact between the 
powerful neighbors 
but asian and soviet experts in and out of government say the 
relaxation of tensions between china and the soviet union while not 
totally to americas advantage could produce some positive steps in 
the pacific region 
whatever concerns we might have had four years ago had this 
come suddenly have now been gradually reduced said paul 
kreisberg a specialist in asian matters with the carnegie endowment 
for international affairs 
no one now expects the soviets and the chinese to restart the 
security alliance they had in the 1950s kreisberg said pointing 
to comments from deng that his moves toward easing tensions with the 
soviets are not designed to damage uschinese relations 
gorbachev is to travel to beijing in may for the summit with 
deng marking the first toplevel meetings between the two countries 
since nikita khrushchev met with mao zedong in 1959 the sessions 
are designed to formally end the 30 years of hostility between the 
onetime rivals for leadership of the communist world and achieve 
a complete normalization of relations soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze announced last week 
there may be some americans who are anxious about this said 
joyce kallgren a director of the institute for east asian studies 
at the university of california at berkeley 
ms kallgren points to the rapid growth of the economic 
relationship between the united states and china arguing that there 
is little reason for the chinese to disturb that trend and the 
sinosoviet relationship has a long way to go to match it she 
said 
are we beginning to see the kind of close chinesesoviet 
relationship that we saw 30 years ago it seems to me that there are 
a lot of reasons why that analogy is a very limited value she 
said 
there hasnt been much of a wringing of hands agreed a 
senior state department official who follows soviet affairs weve 
had a chance to get used to this idea its been coming for 
years 
the official who spoke on condition he not be identified by 
name said the soviet move to mend the ties that had been cut in 
1960 began under former soviet leader leonid brezhnev the chinese 
felt threatened by the sovietbacked vietnamese invasion of cambodia 
and the soviet intrusion into afghanistan and the effort to improve 
the atmosphere did not revive until gorbachev came into power 
needing to develop their economies both nations have strong 
domestic reasons to alleviate tensions and reduce military forces 
along their 4500mile border 
washington is not alarmed by the upcoming summit the us 
official continued because the two countries are not going to 
create a combined sinosoviet threat not a military one not an 
economic one not a political one 
the soviets also are meeting chinese concerns with their 
withdrawal from afghanistan and support for a vietnamese withdrawal 
from cambodia another positive result could be a lessening of 
tension on the korean peninsula where the two powers have vied for 
influence with north koreas kim il sung the experts point out 
and by appearing to be less of a military threat in the pacific 
the soviets are seeking to increase their economic and trade 
connections with nations enjoying the asian economic miracle 
such as japan the carnegies kreisberg said 
former secretary of state cyrus vance wrote recently that the 
united states might see more reason for hope than fear in the 
change 
these two men have it in their power not only to end 
formally a long period of hostility but also to make an enormous 
contribution to peace vance wrote in a joint essay published by 
time magazine with richard holbrooke who worked with vance as an 
assistant secretary for east asian affairs when president carter 
established full diplomatic relations with beijing 
although the united states may lose some of the advantage gained 
by having its own full diplomatic ties with two powers that did not 
speak formally to one another they wrote that the united states 
should not fear the ending of its monopoly of the big three summit 
dialogue 
other experts note that since the united states has entered a 
phase of improved relations with the soviet union it would be 
expected that china forge better ties with its own neighbor 
this brings a balance into the threeway relationship said 
another us official a specialist in asian affairs who also asked 
not to be quoted by name 
president bushs upcoming trip to china and his assertion that 
he is not deploying a china card by flaunting relations with 
beijing over moscow demonstrates that the level of diplomacy among 
the three nations has reached a new plane 
the need for each nation to play off one off another has 
markedly declined the senior us official said

as the last soviet troops prepare to 
leave afghanistan a key question remains can the afghan air force 
keep open kabuls airport the capitals vital link to the outside 
world 
col pavel vinokunov commander of a small soviet guard 
detachment at the airport has no doubts 
the afghan pilots have been trained in the soviet union and 
have continued to study here with us said vinokunov who has been 
in afghanistan more than two years theyll be able to handle it 
no worse than we did 
his words should be put to the test this week sometime before 
wednesday the deadine for the red army to be out of afghanistan 
kabul a city of about 2 million is surrounded by high mountain 
passes which are relatively easy for the usbacked rebels to 
block to cut the flow of goods to the capital winter snow and 
avalanches add to the problem of bringing in supplies 
with no obvious end in sight to the 10yearold civil war the 
kabul airport will be the key link to the rest of the world 
the rebels are armed with sophisticated heatseeking missiles 
the airport has not come under a rebel rocket attack in more than 
a month and no airliner has been shot down over kabul but the 
threat has scared off all civilian aircraft except afghanistans 
ariana airline and an occasional un plane 
on sunday though a un program to bring emergency supplies to 
the capital was interrupted when an ethiopian airlines jet carrying 
the goods was ordered by the ethiopian government not to fly in 
since early january giant soviet military transport planes have 
been airlifting daily hundreds of tons of flour to help ease food 
shortages in the capital 
helicopters circle the snowcovered mountains searching for 
guerrillas and providing a screen of flares to deflect their 
heatseeking missiles 
we would like to give it all up right now and go home said 
alexander kharenko 26 of byelorussia but well finish the job 
well help the afghans its winter and things are rough theres 
hunger in the city its no secret 
vinokunov invited western reporters to the airport to watch their 
operation and then to his quarters for tea sausage liver pate and 
vodka 
the mujahedeen as the moslem rebels are called say many in the 
air force are sympathetic to their cause and will not block the 
overthrow of president najib several afghan pilots have defected to 
pakistan which supports the rebels 
foreign diplomats in kabul however say the air force is an 
elite ideologically motivated group that is closely watched by the 
ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
rahman a 27yearold pilot who studied for three years in the 
soviet union does not hide his feelings about the mujahedeen 
they fire their rockets but they dont know where they will 
land they have no way of being accurate he said standing with 
several soviet pilots next to a helicopter gunship 
i like flying and i like to go out and meet them said 
rahman nicknamed eagle 
ive seen these groups and wiped them out he said as soviet 
soldiers laughed and patted him on the back im good at shooting 
them come for a ride with me and well find some to shoot at 
the soviet departure perhaps will have a psychological impact 
but in practice the afghan air force already shepherds afghan 
planes arriving in and leaving kabul 
afraid of them they are afraid of us said rahman

national leader now whether its at the presidential level or at 
other levels i think the american people will have to decide 
brown said the democratic party has to define itself more clearly 
so that it will have a better chance of winning back white male 
voters in the south and west who have voted republican in recent 
presidential elections 
i think if you asked the average voter in the 40s and 50s and 
60s what a democrat was what a democrat stood for theyd be able 
to tell you but in recent years we have allowed our opponents our 
adversaries our enemies to define us as a party he said you 
cannot win when your opponents set the ground rules 
brown added i think once we start defining ourselves in a 
clear and concise and consistent way that the american people 
understand were going to get back those voters theyre going to 
understand that the last thing we need in this country is two 
republican parties one is plenty enough

plans to expand the fbi crime computer to 
include tracking of suspects not charged with any crime pose serious 
problems for constitutional rights says a panel of computer 
scientists 
the files pose a potential threat to the privacy and civil 
liberties of persons included in the files and to the civil 
liberties of the public in general said the report by computer 
professionals for social responsibility 
the report prepared at the request of rep don edwards 
dcalif was made public sunday edwards is planning to hold 
hearings in march by his house judiciary subcommittee on fbi plans 
to update its crime computer 
edwards praised the computer organizations report and said the 
fbi should drop the tracking proposals 
they pose too many problems in terms of security privacy and 
accuracy and it seems that the tracking proposals wont be very 
useful to law enforcement anyhow edwards said in a statement 
the tracking plan is part of larger blueprints to modernize the 
fbis national crime information center or ncic 
established in 1967 the ncic has long been a focus of 
controversy involving issues of individual privacy it consists of a 
main computer at fbi headquarters plus an array of 
telecommunications lines and a network of state and federal criminal 
information systems 
through this system data is exchanged by more than 64000 state 
local and federal law enforcement agencies it contains some 20 
million records of wanted or missing persons stolen property and 
criminal histories 
according to the report the ncic system answers 750000 
inquiries a day and works almost instantaneously some police 
cruising in squad cars are able to query the computer through mobile 
terminals the report said 
it said the tracking proposals were part of an ncic 2000 
blueprint for updating the system prepared for the fbi under 
contract by the mitre corp 
under this plan the fbi would track individuals not subject to 
an arrest warrant but under investigation if for example such a 
suspect arrived in new york from abroad the system would be 
notified when he passed through customs 
the system itself would notify the law enforcement agency 
investigating the suspect and if on leaving new york he drove 
south on the new jersey turnpike and received a ticket for speeding 
the process would be repeated 
the ncic is a valuable law enforcement tool edwards said 
we should focus on making it better and more accurate but it 
should be limited to public record information like warrants and 
stolen car reports 
he said the agency should go slow in expanding the ncic 
adding that the experts who wrote this report found that the fbi 
still has not addressed the accuracy and reliability problems that 
critics say exist in the system 
the study was prepared by three computer scientists david d 
redell peter g neumann and james j horning along with diana 
gordon a professor of political science at city college of new 
york and janlori goldman an attorney with the american civil 
liberties unions privacy and technology project

president bush is standing up for defense 
secretarydesignate john g tower and expects the senate to confirm 
his nomination and clear him of allegations about his financial and 
personal affairs white house chief of staff john sununu said sunday 
every single allegation that is of significance that has been 
checked has produced a dry hole said sununu 
tower appeared headed for easy confirmation until conservative 
lobbyist paul weyrich testified before the senate armed services 
committee on jan 31 that he had seen the nominee intoxicated and 
accompanied by women other than his wife 
since then allegations have mushroomed a confirmation vote was 
delayed until at least feb 21 by a new allegation last week 
concerning towers campaign finances during his 24year career in 
the senate 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sam nunn 
dga has said that he could not vote in favor of tower until the 
allegations are cleared up nunn also expressed concern over towers 
drinking 
no date has been set for the committee to vote on the nomination 
the senate is in the process of doing about the same thing we 
did before the name went up sununu said on the abctv interview 
program this week with david brinkley we chased down through 
the fbi all those allegations 
the senate has to work its course we understand that thats 
the right thing to do but the president is convinced that the same 
thing will happen as they go through this that those allegations 
will be proven not to have any basis and that when they do vote 
john tower will be confirmed said sununu 
sununu denied that the administration had withheld from 
democratic senators material developed on tower by the fbi 
every time the senate has asked us for information we have 
encouraged the fbi to provide it he said 
sununu also said he did not think nunn was holding up the 
nomination in an effort to enhance his own power 
i dont think thats fair to sam nunn said sununu in 
response to a question ive had a number of discussions as has 
the president with the chairman and in each and every case i 
think sam nunn has put forward a very sincere set of concerns and 
concerns that ought to be followed to the fullest i think the 
senators track record proves that he care about the defense of this 
country we dont have any problems with what is going on 
tower has testified that he does not have an alcohol problem and 
authorized the release of a recent hospital test showing no evidence 
of alcohol abuse 
towers designated spokesmen paul eggers said tower sometimes 
drank too much in the early 1970s but hes not had a drinking 
problem for years

the romantic effect of giving someone a 
heartshaped box of chocolates on valentines day could be more than 
sentimental 
chocolate does have amorous value said george higgins a 
pastry chef instructor at the 8000student johnson amp wales 
university in providence one of the biggest cooking schools in the 
world 
a chemical in the chocolate hits a pleasure center in the 
brain higgins said as a gift from a lover to a lover it would 
certainly help do the trick 
chocolate contains phenylethylamine or pea a natural 
moodaltering chemical also found in the human brain 
win a lottery get a promotion fall in love especially fall 
in love and your pea level shoots up youre optimistic sociable 
and peppy according to chocolate an illustrated history by 
marcia and fredrick morton but if things go wrong especially if 
something goes wrong in your love life you turn listless and 
depressed because your pea level is down 
cocoa butter melts at about body temperature so when you put 
good chocolate in your mouth it begins to melt it becomes a sensual 
thing said gayle steinhart of gayles chocolates in newport in 
a telephone interview from her store in royal oak mich she said 
her sales are 20 times normal on valentines day and the day before 
the taste of chocolate is a sensual pleasure in itself 
existing in the same world as sex sex therapist ruth westheimer 
wrote in her column ask dr ruth 
but theres also an argument against the romantic effects of 
chocolate 
i really wonder whether giving chocolate for valentines day is 
really the best type of gift if one wants to pursue any type of 
intense romantic affair said judith wurtman a research 
scientist at massachusetts institute of technologys department of 
nutrition and food sciences the high fat and the high sugar 
content may make you very sleepy 
if youre dealing in a situation where the woman is being 
pursued by the man it might slow her down theoretically enough that 
she can be caught she added 
whatever the real effect of chocolate the origins of 
chocolategiving on valentines day are obscure 
centuries ago in central america chocolate was associated with 
divinities and so came to represent health and wellbeing according 
to chocolate 
by the 18th century chocolates reputation as an aphrodisiac had 
spread over europe and north america according to the language of 
sex from a to z by robert m goldenson and kenneth n anderson it 
was probably the original alleged aphrodisiac of the western 
hemisphere 
or maybe chocolate and valentines have a simpler relationship 
i have a feeling that sweetheart goes with sweet said lars 
johansson director of the pastry curriculum at johnson and wales 
but for us its just hard work because its a commercial day

the last time two respected black politicians in 
this town ran for the same office things got downright ugly 
that was in 1986 when civil rights movement veterans julian bond 
and john lewis spiked their 25year friendship and fought each other 
for the congressional seat lewis eventually won 
now maynard jackson atlantas first black mayor and michael 
lomax fulton county commission chairman both want to move into 
city hall as mayor when andrew young moves out young is prohibited 
by law from running for a third consecutive term 
lomax who has had designs on the mayors office for at least two 
years announced new years day for the oct 3 nonpartisan 
election jackson who has never ruled out another candidacy since 
he left office in 1981 because of the nothirdterm law is expected 
to announce his candidacy this week 
both insist the campaign will be polite and issueoriented 
history shows they may be wrong and some sniping and stunting has 
already begun 
were all going to work hard and run a clean campaign 
jackson said in a recent interview 
i dont think itll be dirty lomax said we all have to 
have opponents i dont view this with hostility 
atlanta political pollster claibourne darden disagreed 
without question this will be a dirty race they always end up 
that way darden said they always end up calling each other 
racists you can count on that happening 
this wont be an issue election this will be a personality 
election darden said 
lomax 41 has served on the fulton county commission for 10 
years eight of them as chairman at a time when the northern part of 
the county which encompasses predominantly black central atlanta 
has undergone an economic and population boom 
jackson 50 laid plans for the expansion of the citys airport 
and rail transit system he also fought to see that a portion of the 
construction work on those projects would go to minority contractors 
in the 1986 congressional battle lewis demanded that bond submit 
to a drug test and bond accused lewis of abandoning black voters 
for the sake of white corporate interests 
at one point bond said to lewis i had to wait 25 years to 
find out you really dont think i amount to much the men were 
barely speaking to each other by the campaigns end 
in this years mayoral race the issues are drugs and crime the 
niceties already are being thrown out the window 
lomax petitioned members of the fulton county commission to 
undergo drug tests he submitted to one himself and passed jackson 
responded if anyone wants to challenge me to a drug test ill 
meet them on the steps of city hall cup in hand 
lomax scheduled vigils at the bankhead courts housing project 
where various services were suspended when postal carriers and 
telephone repairmen were chased away by the gunfire of drug dealers 
jackson showed up and proposed eliminating the citys housing 
authority and turning the projects into tenantowned cooperatives 
he said cash rewards should be given to residents who turn in their 
drugdealing neighbors funds the residents could use toward the 
purchase of their homes 
jackson spoke at a midjanuary businessmens luncheon in 
atlantas ritzy buckhead section lomax responded by accusing 
jackson of sleeping in buckhead while he was camping out in 
bankhead 
when lomax announced his candidacy during a new years day 
rally at another drugridden housing project about 20 protesters 
toting placards reading no lomax for mayor rained on his 
parade some in the lomax camp suspected jackson forces sent them 
protest organizer roy yancy said they showed up on their own 
jackson said lomaxs newfound populist label is not going to be 
able to stick 
what weve got is people who view public service in different 
ways jackson said i think one of the things thats going to 
come out of this campaign is a difference in the candidates as to 
how we look at and treat people 
lomax who came from los angeles said the voters may not buy 
jacksons image as a concerned native son 
i understand that atlanta is a city which has a tremendous 
tradition of homegrown leadership lomax said but i think the 
issues have gone unaddressed in this city over the last 16 years

three months after republicans and democrats 
in the indiana house found themselves deadlocked at 50 members each 
and pledged to cooperate their marriage of convenience is showing 
signs of strain 
the honeymoon appears to be over and the inlaws have moved 
in is how house republican speaker paul s mannweiler put it 
recently 
the house became bogged down in a series of disputes after 
democrats began to exert their new power to block a 51vote majority 
and republicans showed frustration at losing control of the chamber 
for the first time in 12 years 
it was strained and there were times i think people were 
frustrated said rep stanley g jones the house democratic floor 
leader 
both sides in the house pledged unprecedented bipartisan 
cooperation after democrats picked up two seats in the november 
election which also made evan bayh the states first democratic 
governor in 20 years and the 100 seats split 5050 
after a deadlock on organization day in late november 
negotiations finished on thanksgiving yielded a unique powersharing 
agreement 
it called for cospeakers one from each party presiding on 
alternate days cochairmen of the houses 28 committees and new 
rules designed to prevent one party from holding the other partys 
legislation hostage 
it seemed to work after the session opened jan 4 but events in 
the last couple of weeks demonstrated one party can still impose its 
will on the other 
on a day when democratic speaker michael k phillips was 
presiding democrats prevented a committee report on a republican 
bill from moving to the amendment stage on the house floor 
two days later democrats voted as a block to prevent a majority 
and defeat 40 republicanwritten amendments to a bill to create a 
state lottery 
i think obviously weve been shown that 50 united people can 
deny 50 other people the opportunity to have input said 
mannweiler 
its easy to take 50 votes and stop something its not so easy 
to get 51 votes and enact something he said 
during the debate on the committee report house republican floor 
leader richard m dellinger argued that democrats were stepping back 
from a tievote rule they had insisted upon during novembers 
negotiations that rule allows a bill to emerge from committee on a 
tie vote previously a bill had to have a majority vote to advance 
dellinger said blocking a committee report was like having a 
red flag in front of a bull 
so a few days later the lottery bill which had been expected to 
enjoy broad bipartisan support triggered a partisan debate 
republicans offered a series of amendments proposing expenditures 
for education and human services programs that democrats have long 
favored that forced the democrats to vote against the amendments in 
order to preserve the lottery bill as bayh wanted it 
after that mannweiler said there was some frustration that 
partisanship on the part of the democrats was spoiling what had been 
a fairly evenhanded system so far 
jones responded that democrats presided fairly adding theres 
no question theres frustration among the gop theres the same 
frustration i felt as a minority member of this body 
jones said he hopes republicans would not get involved in tit 
for tat that serves no one republicans or democrats 
mannweiler said he hopes the displays of power will bring 
seasoned minds to think there has to be a better way 
other leaders were not so sure 
it appears to me we are headed for a long strange year or two 
years until another election gives one party a majority said 
house republican caucus chairman dan stephan

a judge who fled colombia after being threatened 
by the alleged head of a major drug cartel is living in detroit 
protected around the clock by guards paid by the united states a 
newspaper reported sunday 
consuelo sanchezduran and her husband augusto have lived in 
the detroit area since october under the protection of about 70 
guards hired by the us government the detroit news quoted 
unidentified law enforcement officials as saying 
it was unclear why federal officials chose the detroit area as 
sanchezs hiding place but the news said local police were 
concerned that her presence could endanger her neighbors or other 
people with whom she comes in contact 
sanchez described by the paper as being in her 30s fled 
colombia after issuing a murder charge against pablo escobar 
gaviria who the us drug enforcement administration says is head 
of the medellin cartel blamed for smuggling most of the cocaine 
that reaches the united states a rival cartel is based in the 
colombian city of calli 
the judge ordered escobar arrested and charged with murder in the 
dec 17 1987 killing of guillermo cano owner of the bogota daily 
newspaper el espectador fifteen others also were charged 
escobar who has been reported to have financed lowincome 
housing and parks in medellin has not been tried 
members of the organization are suspected of carrying out dozens 
of murders in latin america and the united states 
the organization sent sanchez a threatening letter before she 
signed the arrest warrant the letter published in colombian 
newspapers in august said that if she issued the warrant her entire 
family including ancestors and offspring would be killed 
we are capable of executing you anywhere on this planet the 
letter said there is no place you can hide 
officials say escobar offered a 1 million murder contract for 
sanchez 
in four years drug traffickers in colombia have killed two dozen 
judges a justice minister an attorney general three journalists 
and scores of policemen and soldiers the news said that in the past 
seven years more than 50 colombian judges have been killed 
officials told the news the us state department is paying the 
estimated 15000 weekly security and living cost from 5 million 
provided by the 1988 omnibus drug bill and earmarked for the 
protection of colombian jurists who indict drug dealers 
the dea helped sanchez leave colombia flew her to miami and 
eventually brought her to detroit according to the newspaper 
because the news learned and disclosed details about sanchez the 
government is likely to move her the newspaper said 
theyre going to have to change everything now that the cats 
out of the bag thats for sure the newspaper quoted one federal 
official as saying 
escobar also is under federal indictment in miami on several 
charges but is able to avoid extradition because colombia no longer 
recognizes its 1977 extradition treaty with the united states 
he was listed as a billionaire by fortune magazine two years ago

highaltitude winds forced a 
postponement sunday of the launch the air forces new delta 2 space 
rocket with an advanced navigation satellite 
the postponement was announced just 13 minutes before the planned 
liftoff after balloon data showed that shear winds several miles 
above the launch pad were too high for the rocket to pass through 
safely 
we have scrubbed the launch of the navstar mission because of 
the upper level wind conditions lt col ron rand the air force 
launch commentator reported wind velocities were not reported 
the launch was rescheduled for 130 pm tuesday 
rand said a twoday delay was needed to provide rest for the 
launch team 
the maiden launch of the delta 2 is to carry into space a 65 
million navstar satellite that will enable nato military users such 
as ships planes trucks and tanks to locate their positions within 
50 feet the accuracy for civilian users will be 300 feet 
the delta 2 is a more powerful model of the delta 1 which has 
logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960 it is the first of 
three new space boosters the air force ordered built to carry 
national security payloads after the space shuttle challenger 
explosion in 1986 
the grounding of the shuttle fleet and the titan 34d rocket also 
after a 1986 failure has left the pentagon with a backlog of about 
40 reconnaissance communications navigation and other military 
satellites to be launched 
the new titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month 
with the atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch 
the navstar satellite orbiting 11000 miles up is to join seven 
earlier model navstars already on patrol the air force goal is a 
constellation of 21 of the upgraded payloads in orbit by 1992 to 
provide total global coverage

the prospect that ferdinand marcos may 
soon die presents his successor corazon aquino with the 
unpalatable decision of whether to let him return home 
it also has led to speculation about who will lead marcos 
followers upon his death 
the former president has been hospitalized in honolulu since jan 
16 and last week suffered a relapse of pneumonia and bronchial 
asthma he remains in critical condition on a respirator in an 
intensive care unit 
supporters of the 71yearold marcos say he is dying and wants to 
return to the country he ruled for 20 years until he was ousted in 
1986 in a popular uprising 
mrs aquino has repeatedly banned marcos from returning citing 
security concerns but she allowed a filipino official to travel to 
the united states to talk with marcos representatives 
the decision suggested she might consider negotiating a deal 
possibly involving the return of some of the estimated 10 billion 
marcos and his associates allegedly embezzled during his 
administration 
because the governments position is not entirely clear rumors 
abound about an impending deal there is lively debate among 
politicians and commentators on what mrs aquino should do 
national interest demands that we deny him a homecoming 
wrote the independent philippine daily inquirer in sum 
marcos even in death should not be allowed to return to the 
philippines 
but senate president jovito salonga said marcos should be allowed 
to come home to die if he can settle federal racketeering charges 
us authorities filed against him in october 
even if marcos dies abroad the government would face the 
emotional question of whether to allow him to be buried in his 
native land 
the administration has given mixed signals on the issue and 
opinion among politicians and commentators is divided 
last week several manila newspapers quoted officials as saying 
the cabinet has opted for a napoleonic solution banning marcos 
body from being returned to the philippines 
the phrase was coined by sen john osmena who recommended the 
government follow the example of napoleon the french emperor died 
in exile on st helena island in 1821 and his body was not returned 
to france until 19 years later 
osmena said the government would face mass demonstrations by 
marcos followers and leftwing extremists if marcos body were 
brought to the philippines mrs aquino says the matter has not been 
settled 
forbidding a funeral here would infuriate marcos supporters and 
risk portraying mrs aquino as vengeful and unforgiving especially 
since she refused marcos requests to return home in may after his 
95yearold mother died 
considering the fact that we filipinos revere the dead and even 
forgive their misdeeds and wrongdoings while alive a marcos burial 
in his hometown should make cory rise above the pettiness and 
recriminations of the people around her wrote independent 
columnist emil jurado in the manila standard 
on friday filipino news organizations received anonymous letters 
that said a coup called operation valentine would be staged 
around valentines day wednesday military officers alleged to be 
part of the conspiracy included some of mrs aquinos most trusted 
lieutenants 
it appeared the letters were a rightwing attempt to sow distrust 
and to pressure mrs aquino into acceding to marcos demand to 
return home she dismissed the letters as a prank 
but military chief of staff gen renato de villa said three 
renegade officers including former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan met recently in secret to discuss joining forces honasan 
led an august 1987 coup attempt in which 53 people were killed and 
hundreds wounded 
another question raised by marcos poor health is who would lead 
his supporters should he die 
several candidates have emerged including vice president 
salvador laurel who met marcos in hawaii this month and sen juan 
ponce enrile whom mrs aquino fired as defense minister in 1986 
after a failed coup by his followers 
several politicians have pointed to eduardo cojuangco a wealthy 
former marcos ally who lives in california cojuangco is also a 
cousin of mrs aquino 
the figure to watch is really danding said rep bonifacio 
gillego calling cojuangco by his nickname people admire him 
because he did not bring his wealth out of the country and knows how 
to take care of his people 
former labor minister blas ople told the manila chronicle that 
cojuangco will be a serious competitor within the opposition for 
use of assets if he has a mind to use them

at least 55 people were killed in the 
last two days of campaigning for legislative elections including 36 
villagers massacred while they slept officials said sunday 
it is the worst and bloodiest election campaign in sri lankas 
history said elmo gooneratne a senior government official 
in the bloodiest attack tamil militants attacked the villagers 
in a remote jungle of central sri lanka 
officials blamed militant sinhalese for the other 19 slayings 
including the assassination of an opposition party candidate he was 
the 14th wouldbe legislator to die since campaigning for 
wednesdays elections began five weeks ago 
more than 1000 people have been killed since nominations for the 
elections began jan 6 
they will be the first parliamentary elections in sri lanka since 
1977 a 1982 referendum doubled the normal sixyear life of the 
legislature elected in 1977 
campaigning ends midnight sunday most of the 1400 candidates 
for 225 parliamentary seats spent the day addressing meetings and 
making lastminute appeals for votes 
the village massacre was perpetrated by more than 50 rebels who 
crept into the ricefarming village of dutuwewa and attacked with 
automatic rifle fire clubs and machetes late saturday said a 
police officer contacted by telephone in nearby horawapatana 
military officials in colombo said the 36 victims included 20 
children 
the rebels attacked a cluster of houses close to the jungle 
according to the police officer who said he was first to arrive at 
the scene other villagers heard shooting and screams but were too 
frightened to come out 
dutuwewa is about 60 miles northeast of colombo the capital the 
village is in the predominantly sinhalese north central province 
but lies just outside eastern province a main operational area for 
tamil separatists 
hundreds of army commandos and police fanned out in marshy 
jungles surrounding the village to search for the killers while 
helicopters made aerial surveys to prevent the rebels escaping the 
policeman said on condition of anonymity 
a foreign ministry official in colombo blamed the killings on the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most powerful tamil guerrilla 
group which has waged a bloody war for independence since 1983 
the tigers issued a statement denying responsibility 
more than 8500 people have died in ethnic violence as minority 
tamils press their attacks on the sinhalese majority that dominates

in southern sri lanka attackers wearing camouflage uniforms 
killed somapala amarakeerthi of the sri lanka freedom party his 
brother david and a supporter military officials said 
the killings happened saturday in karandeniya 37 miles south of 
colombo authorities blame most political killings in the south on 
sinhalese extremists of the peoples liberation front who have 
vowed to disrupt the election they accuse the government of making 
too many concessions to the tamils 
among 16 political party supporters killed in a series of attacks 
across central and southern sri lanka were six moslem supporters of 
president ranasinghe premadasas ruling united national party 
attacked while they were meeting to discuss election strategies

the white house budget chief said sunday that 
democratic members of congress are free to propose new taxes but 
insisted that more taxes are not needed to reduce the federal 
deficit 
what would happen in a negotiation is that we are certainly not 
going to bring up taxes said richard darman director of the 
office of management and budget the president has made his 
position extremely clear 
if the other side wants to bring up taxes we will have to 
discuss that on the merits and our position is that the merits 
dont require taxes darman said on the cbstv program face the 
nation president bush campaigned on a pledge not to raise taxes 
darman was to discuss the administrations budget proposal monday 
with the democratic chairmen of the senate and house budget 
committees sen jim sasser of tennessee and rep leon panetta of 
california 
i look forward to learning a little bit more about what theyre 
thinking of as their own possible budget darman said ive 
noticed some things that theyve said which suggest to me meaning 
no disrespect that they perhaps have not yet fully read the book 
a 193page budget proposal that bush sent congress last thursday 
bush said his proposal would leave a deficit of 911 billion 
well within the 100 billion required by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
the democratic chairman of the house ways and means committee 
rep dan rostenkowski of chicago said the bush proposal did not 
spell out how the government would ease the deficit 
i dont know whether were going to increase taxes 
rostenkowski said on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley but i do know one thing we cant increase them without 
the president of the united states 
darman said many details on revenue and spending were left to be 
worked out in negotiations between the democratic congress and the 
republican administration because if people take positions that 
are too sharp too partisan too publicly it tends to prevent the 
system from coming together 
proposing new taxes said darman would be entirely up the 
democracts but i can assure you that i am not going to bring it 
up 
i would think that the democrats i cant advise them but i 
would think that they would not wish to be in that position there 
isnt a need he said 
as soon as one opens the door for taxes then the system loses 
discipline said darman what we need in this system now is 
discipline if you were suddenly to say you know we can duck 
this whole problem by just having a little tax increase the next 
thing that happens is everybody starts saying well wed like to 
spend more on this more on that more on that and you dont cut 
the deficit

a comatose woman who received an abortion 
after a twoweek legal battle was in guarded condition sunday as her 
family explored moving her to a rehabilitation facility in new 
jersey or boston 
nancy klein 32 was at north shore university hospital sunday 
with all signs stable a hospital spokesman said one day after mrs 
klein was given an abortion requested by her husband she was 18 
weeks pregnant 
attorneys involved in the case said the courts decision to allow 
martin klein of upper brookville in long island to order an abortion 
for his wife broke legal ground 
it was a tough case because we didnt have a law to directly 
point to for an answer said anthony dauria an attorney for 
north shore university hospital 
mrs klein has been in a coma since she was severely brain 
damaged in a car accident dec 13 martin klein her husband of nine 
years began court proceedings on jan 26 to become her guardian so 
he could order an abortion doctors said could aid her recovery 
abortion opponents challenged klein from local courts to the us 
supreme court losing when justice thurgood marshall refused to 
issue a stay friday after overnight preparations the abortion was 
performed saturday morning as activists still tried to find a 
legal way to stop it 
mrs klein will remain in the hospital while her husband and 
other family members research a rehabilitation facility where she 
can be placed under consideration are places in new jersey near 
where kleins sister lives and one in the boston area family 
members said 
i couldnt bear to be that far away from nancy klein said 
last week 
one of the reasons klein sought the abortion he said is that 
some rehabilitation facilities would not accept a pregnant woman 
after the abortion was announced antiabortion activist john 
short vowed to press the appeal with the full supreme court even 
though it is moot to set a precedent so similar cases would not 
occur 
but the ruling may have dealt a blow to opponents who have 
attempted to intervene in cases where they apparently have no 
clearcut interest legally some lawyers said 
one of the important aspects of this case is that it is the 
first time a court has squarely said to these prolife groups it is 
inappropriate to interfere in the private decisions of a family 
said elizabeth bradford an assistant state attorney general whose 
office was called in to take part in the proceedings 
a new york state appeals court in dismissing an appeal from 
short and john broderick another activist called them absolute 
strangers who whatever their motivation have no place in the 
midst of a family tragedy 
the importance of this case is that it establishes that the 
next of kin need only prove that the patient is incapable of forming 
an opinion or granting consent said dauria under this ruling 
it would be no longer necessary in the state for courts to weigh the 
relative risks or advantages or even necessity of an abortion 
in issuing the first ruling in the case nassau county state 
supreme court justice bernard mccaffrey rejected the contention that 
this was a decision where there had to be clear and convincing 
evidence of what the womans wishes would have been before an 
abortion could be performed in new york state the supreme court is 
a triallevel court 
dauria said that fathers rights also may have been furthered by 
the case 
this case has marked a slight departure from previous existing 
law that stated that fathers do not have the right to determine 
whether a woman should have an abortion dauria said

a lebanese boy growing up amid the rubble of 
beirut has known little but war in his 14 years but his vision of 
peace has been singled out in an international poster contest 
the rendering of a dove emerging through shades of blue over a 
blooming red rose drawn by mustafa mustafa tahoukji captured the 
theme of the contest peace will help us grow said charles 
stuckey curator of 20thcentury painting and sculpture at the art 
institute of chicago and one of five judges 
it just came as a stunner when we found out the winning poster 
came from a child who was witnessing the nightmarish reality that 
one associates with lebanon for the last decade stuckey said 
saturday 
tahoukji will receive 500 and a trip to the united nations with 
his family to receive an award march 13 cannon said 
the lions club tried to call an affiliate in lebanon so officials 
there could tell the boy the good news but the language barrier 
prevented much exchange said patrick cannon spokesman for the oak 
parkbased lions club lions officials planned to send a telex to 
lebanon with more detailed information but cannon said the boy 
still may not have learned that his entry won 
the contest sponsored by lions club international examined 
entries from nearly 100000 children in 49 countries 
the 24 finalists posters and tahoukjis winning entry unveiled 
friday are on display at the art institute through feb 28 the 
finalists will receive 100 and a certificate cannon said 
it was the simplicity of the boys poster the shape of the 
doves body and the expression on its face that persuaded the 
judges to choose it over more abstract representations of peace 
its a difficult form of art because when one wants to reduce 
things down to essentials the risk is a oneliner stuckey 
said he made it more complicated without throwing away the 
simplicity 
the contest was designed to give young people an opportunity to 
think about peace and express it visually using their emotions and 
their talents said cannon 
many of the posters featured similar themes which stuckey 
attributes to the innocence of the participants ages 10 through 14 
and increased communication among nations 
theres something so uniform about the designs he said if 
this were done 30 years ago i would think it would be really rather 
obvious that these were coming from different parts of the world 
obviously doves were a common image but another from finland 
had a forest of trees growing in the night he said

food medicine and blankets over two weeks may be cancelled he

volunteer firemen ran out of water fighting 
a house fire that killed eight people and had to refill the water 
tanks on their trucks five miles away authorities said 
but officials said the fire spread so fast that more water 
probably would not have saved the lives of the eight family members 
who died in the blaze early saturday 
i dont think water would have made much of a difference as far 
as lives said deputy forrest brewster of the sheriffs office 
the roof had already caved in when i got there at 340 am 
brewster said it was engulfed in flames there wasnt any sounds 
coming from inside there then 
jb gibbs who is in his 50s and his daughter angela in her 
20s escaped his wife six of their children and a 2yearold 
granddaughter were found dead in their beds in two bedrooms five 
in one and three in the other 
gibbs was awakened by the fire and tried to wake his wife 
bernice but she wouldnt move said woodruff county sheriff 
leon creasey 
he was hysterical the sheriff said 
the fire which authorities believe started from a crack in the 
chimney attached to a woodburning stove used to heat the house was 
reported by neighbors just after 3 am 
brewster said the four 500gallon trucks from three volunteer 
fire departments responding to the blaze made five or more trips to 
fire hydrants in the grays community five miles away to fill up 
their tanks 
the home in revels about 60 miles northeast of little rock was 
due to be connected to the public water supply in the spring but 
was still relying on well water along with other homes in the rural 
community according to woodruff county judge john davis 
creasey identified the dead members of the gibbs family as 
bernice 46 audrey 25 shirley 30 kartarla 18 belisha 14

the special prosecutor for the irancontra 
affair credits the press with exposing the case and opening it to 
public scrutiny even if security blocks his case against former 
white house aide oliver north fails 
there are two ways of enforcing the law special prosecutor 
lawrence walsh told a group of oklahoma broadcasters saturday night 
one is the old way of prosecution which is long expensive 
cumbersome and sometimes has unforeseeable results 
and the other way is by exposure and education and that is 
what your profession does so well 
walsh an oklahoma city lawyer was in tulsa to be honored by the 
oklahoma association of broadcasters 
the chief justice of the supreme court on sunday ordered a delay 
in the start of norths trial to give the full court a chance to 
consider a dispute over the possible disclosure of national secrets 
us district judge gerhard a gesell had ordered the trial to 
begin monday but justice department attorneys asked the high court 
for the delay based on claims that north could release highly 
classified documents during his defense 
walsh praised the media for its coverage of the irancontra 
affair and the events leading up to the north trial saying he was 
surprised how accurate the media reports were about information he 
later obtained in his own investigation 
for six months i got more out of the papers than i did from my 
entire staff he said 
but he said the irony of a strong effective press is evident in 
the administrations request to forbid use of certain classified 
documents by north in his defense 
the commitment to a public trial leads to the sometimes very 
difficult choices of whether certain information can be used at 
trial or whether certain charges must be dropped he said 
walsh 77 said he believes the trial should continue without 
further limitations placed on use of evidence which could lead to 
the dismissal of some or all charges against north if he is not 
allowed to use the information to defend himself 
its important to see if we can apply the law to all people 
all levels of government and to all activities whether they are 
open or secret and at the same time preserve our obligation for a 
public trial walsh said 
walsh a former president of the american bar association was 
appointed special prosecutor dec 19 1986 by a panel of three 
federal judges

balloons bearing offers of a 24 million reward for the release of 
american prisoners of war said sunday he is confident the balloons 
will reach vietnam and laos 
william hendon 44 said he and relatives of three american 
servicemen missing from the war released 600 to 700 balloons from a 
trawler 40 miles south of hong kong and 375 miles off the vietnamese 
coast over the weekend 
our balloons will stay up 36 hours and i feel confident some 
will land in laos and vietnam hendon said in an interview 
each heliumfilled balloon carries a message in vietnamese and 
laotian offering the reward in cash or gold to anyone who turns over 
to us custody one or more american prisoners of war 
hendon a twoterm republican congressman from north carolina 
defeated in 1986 said his pow publicity fund is convinced us 
servicemen still are being held captive in the two countries 14 
years after the conflict ended 
the us government says it has been unable to prove that any of 
the 2383 americans listed as missing in action are held prisoner 
but it says the possibility cannot be discounted and investigations 
continue 
vietnam and laos deny holding us servicemen 
hendons group was formed by families of the missing men and 
others to advertise the reward pledged mostly by 21 members of 
congress 
the former congressman was accompanied by elizabeth stewart of 
washington and bobby bischoff of wilson nc whose fathers are 
among missing us servicemen and jeffrey donahue of cocoa beach

the first episcopal woman bishop preached a sunday 
sermon that mixed evangelical zeal with a call to social activism 
saying that if episcopal church leaders had faltered amid 
controversy she would not have been consecrated 
we live in a word that oppresses that dehumanizes that is 
replete with injustices and exploitation a world god did not 
intend said bishop barbara c harris in a sermon at the cathedral 
church of saint paul 
if jesus had not taken risks we would not be saved harris 
said a day after her consecration drew worldwide attention if the 
diocese of massachusetts had decided to play it safe i would not be 
here wearing a brochet and a chimere and a pectoral cross 
she received a standing ovation from most of the 400 worshipers 
but one tampa fla couple left the church with the wife in tears 
saying she was heartbroken by harris consecration the couple 
declined to give their name 
in a sermon that discussed the temptation of christ in a modern 
context harris called on the congregation to resist the temptation 
to shut their eyes to issues such as racism and aids 
under the guise of tradition and convention we temporize with 
oppression and compromise with injustice she said we avoid the 
problem and the responsibility for becoming involved and we 
rationalize to ourselves theres no harm in walking with the devil 
as long as hes going your way 
the mood was upbeat in the church 
i felt like i was out of my body said delois ward who came 
from philadelphia to watch her friend of 15 years be consecrated 
this weekend it was like the dream i didnt dare dream had come 
true 
also at the sermon was florence timoi li the first woman ever 
to be ordained as an episcopal priest li was ordained in 1944 in 
wartorn china so she could give communion to those in macao while 
the city was under japanese siege but two years later under 
pressure from other anglican churches she agreed not to continue 
being a practicing priest though she did not renounce her ordination 
i am very very happy said li now 81 and living in toronto 
i am yellow she is black it breaks down the barriers god 
creates boys and girls two sexes now this makes gods will 
realized 
ward predicted that the new bishops warmth would sustain her 
as harris entered the church sunday morning ward said i said 
to her come here let me kiss the bishops ring and she said

the foreign ministers of france greece and 
spain on sunday said their middle east tour demonstrates the 
european communitys decision to take a more active role in bringing 
peace to the region 
during a press conference at the end of a sevenhour visit to 
cairo spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said 
that despite all efforts he could not predict that 1989 could see 
the start of the peace process

the three ministers were designated by the european communitys 
council of ministers to explore peace possibilities in the middle 
east 
fernandez ordonez said the eec has adopted a new attitude toward 
the middle east peace process and he said the new policy includes 
the decision to move from a level of declaration to a level of 
active involvement this visit to egypt takes place within a 
framework of contacts with all parties concerned 
we emphasize the necessity of the early convening of an 
international peace conference we have three objectives first 
to exchange points of view with the main parties in the conflict 
second to contribute to push forward the peace process and third 
to assess the situation in order to consider further steps to be 
taken eventually

persuade israel to join an international peace conference which the 
jewish state has rejected it prefers direct negotiations with a 
joint jordanianpalestinian delegation

martha mitchell as played by estelle parsons in 
the unguided missile is a quirky opinionated woman far 
shrewder than her husband john mitchell at foreseeing the 
postwatergate downfall 
miss parsons does a formidable job she has the look of martha 
mitchell in a floral dress with a superfluous ruffle the stridency 
and the southern accent 
through it all comes a woman of charm warmth spirit and brains 
a free spirit believing its a free country 
in the play by david wolpe which opened sunday at the 
offbroadway american place theater mrs mitchell does such 
uncharming things as get drunk and rant that liberals should be run 
out of the country 
she also discerns postwatergate events shrewdly while her 
husband the attorney general thinking himself vastly smarter than 
his wife he tells her that hell be loyal to president nixon and 
that the president will protect him 
her husband calls her a bigot says he loves her for it and calls 
her an unguided missile because of her unpredictability 
jerome dempsey playing mitchell is convincing when he is 
proclaiming love for and frustration with his wife hes less 
convincing when he proclaims how powerful he is seeming more at 
home in a later scene where he admits that he was summoned to the 
white house but kept sitting around and never met with the president 
the play begins the day of the watergate breakin in 1972 with 
mrs mitchell kept a prisoner in her home by a man who says hes 
fbi he gives her pills and drinks has a doctor give her a shot and 
keeps her away from the phone when mitchell returns home five days 
later one hand is bandaged and the other arm in a sling 
later she tells reporters she has proof the president ordered 
the breakin while her husband is testifying that he didnt even 
tell the president about it an angry mitchell tells her that even 
her daughter hates her 
in a final scene in a hospital bed mrs mitchell blithely 
relies on the reporter she often telephoned at night lezlie dalton 
to do something about her money having run out 
one is left less with an analysis of political events than with a 
multifaceted portrait of a woman at a time of crisis miss parsons 
portrayal gains a viewers sympathy and even respect for martha 
mitchell 
the play was commissioned in 1984 and has since been rewritten 
it is being performed more than 12 years after martha mitchells 
death mitchell died last fall 
fred kolo directed holger designed the set and lighting and 
matthew heineman designed what is seen on tv monitors above the

invade that country saying pakistan has enough problems of its own 
without foreign adventures 
ms bhutto stopped short of ruling out an eventual confederation

troops which have been backing the government of afghan president 
najib in its war with moslem guerrillas 
lets see what the afghan people decide for themselves ms 
bhutto told a news conference on the second day of a visit intended

invasion he accused afghan guerrillas of having agreed to link the 
country in a confederation with pakistan in return for pakistani 
arms and money 
ms bhutto denied pakistan was moving troops to the border and 
said it would be naive for pakistan to try to annex afghanistan 
weve got enough problems of national integration she said 
we dont need foreign adventures 
people sometimes propose a confederation with one neighbor or 
another she added stray ideas like this may have come up 
in the past in relation to afghanistan i do not know because they 
have not gathered the weight to be considered by anybody

former gov jerry brown a twotime 
democratic presidential hopeful says it feels good to be back in 
politics after ending six years of selfimposed political exile with 
election to a party job 
it feels very good it feels great its been six years but it 
feels like six months brown told reporters after he won the 
chairmanship of the california democratic party 
he defeated investment banker steve westly a longtime volunteer 
unknown outside of party circles by 1591 votes to 777 in balloting 
late saturday among delegates to the state partys annual convention 
brown who dropped out of public view after ending his eightyear 
tenure as governor ended in a losing race for the us senate to 
republican pete wilson in 1982 described the race for the unpaid 
party post as his reentry into politics he said he hopes to run 
for other unspecified public offices in the future 
but the 50yearold twoterm governor who launched his first 
presidential campaign at age 36 pledged that he would devote 
himself to rebuilding the california democratic party and wouldnt 
seek any other public office during his fouryear term as state 
party chairman 
saturdays vote was browns first election victory in over a 
decade since winning his second term as governor in 1978 he lost a 
series of presidential primaries in 1980 and then was defeated for 
the senate in 1982 
asked by reporters if he might run for president or the us 
senate again someday brown replied that those are the kinds of 
intentions that lie deep in ones heart 
westly had argued that brown would be a lightning rod for 
political criticism breathing new life into republican attacks 
against controversial events of browns tenure as governor such as 
his appointment of unpopular former chief justice rose bird 
other critics said browns notoriously chaotic administrative 
style didnt suit the detailoriented duties of a state chairman 
and questioned browns new interest in a formal party structure that 
he frequently shunned or ridiculed as irrelevant when he was 
governor 
brown acknowledged all of those criticisms alternately joking 
about his reputation and seriously promising that he has reflected 
on both his successes and failure during the six years he has spent 
out of the public eye writing meditating and traveling around the 
world 
i can become the media dark hole that absorbs all the negative 
feedback and allows our candidate for governor to go on to victory 
unscathed brown said in an acceptance speech 
brown said he is seriously devoted to the nuts and bolts of 
party work laying out an agenda that ranged from redefining 
democratic constituencies to operational goals ranging from the 
revival of nearly dormant local democratic clubs which thrived in 
california in the 1950s to new technologies in communications and 
fundraising

pravda told its soviet readers on sunday that nato 
believes the east bloc economies are doing so poorly that they will 
fall further behind the west for another two decades 
in a short answer to a readers question the official communist 
party newspaper said voice of america did not lie when it reported 
the pessimistic economic projections given by nato official henning 
waggoner 
but pravda said the conclusions in the report were on 
waggoners conscience 
pravda summarized the nato report saying it projected no more 
than 2 percent economic growth per year and a widening economic gap 
between east and west until well into the next century 
the systems deficiencies are so obvious that the soviet 
union has no choice but to continue reforms this significantly 
reduces its opportunities to use national funds for military 
affairs pravda said in explaining waggoners stand 
pravda said the official recommended against any western aid to 
the soviet union

cardinal joachim meisner on sunday 
officially took over leadership of the powerful cologne archdiocese 
as thousands of protesters rallied against the vaticans strict 
stand on birth control 
meisners appointment and the pope john paul iis conservative 
policies have caused a widening rift between west germanys roman 
catholics and the vatican in recent months 
several thousand people jammed the square outside the massive 
cologne cathedral one group held up a banner that read end the 
papal dictatorship as meisner arrived by limousine for a mass 
marking the assumption of his duties 
other signs welcomed the new archbishop and he was given a 
standing ovation when he entered the packed church 
the hourlong ceremony was broadcast live by the national ard 
television network 
cologne church leaders were angered last year when the pope 
insisted on the appointment of meisner an east german who was 
previously bishop of berlin 
many cologne church leaders felt meisner was too conservative and 
expressed displeasure that their wishes were not considered in 
naming a replacement for the late cardinal joseph hoeffner who died 
in october 1987 
the cologne archdiocese is one of the most influential in western 
europe and one of the richest in the world 
the delay in a new appointment also led to a clash between state 
leaders and the vatican under a 1929 agreement local clerics and 
governments are given a say in the selection process 
in his sermon to the congregation on sunday meisner sought 
reconciliation with those who opposed his appointment but also 
clearly reaffirmed a conservative course that goes to the heart of 
divisions between west german catholics and the popes policies 
my hand is outstretched to all for whom i carry 
responsibility meisner said i ask all to return this gesture 
so that we may work together to fulfill the lords task 
but meisner also warned against the perils of adopting secular 
impulses and straying from church teachings 
the task of the church is not to align itself to the changing 
spirit of the times meisner said 
referring to the controversy over his appointment meisner said 
continued public assignment of blame on this or other addresses 
will not serve the future path of the cologne church 
the issue of meisners appointment has become part of a larger 
dispute in west germany over vatican policies in recent months 
in late january a group of 170 roman catholic theologians 
released a declaration strongly criticizing john paul ii and the 
church ban on artificial birth control 
the document called the cologne declaration complained that the 
pope recently has linked the churchs teachings on birth control too 
closely to fundamental articles of faith such as the holiness of god

bombings with a sitin at a palestinian mayors office sunday and 
five arabs were injured in clashes with soldiers israeli and arab 
reports said 
the protest underscored increasing settler vigilantism that this 
month included angry rampages into arab towns and stoning of arab 
cars 
me and my friends decided we should get the message across to 
qalqilya and the mayor that we have lost our patience settler 
shlomo katan told israel radio after the group barged into mayor 
mahmoud abu sneinehs office in the west bank city of qalqilya 
the settlers warned abu sneineh they would riot if he did not 
stop palestinians from stoning and firebombing their cars which pass 
through qalqilya to and from the west bank 
katan council head in alfe menashe settlement said the settlers 
wanted to talk with sneineh in a good atmosphere but israel 
radio said soldiers spirited the mayor out of the office before 
talks could take place 
a military officer forced the settlers out of the office about 
three hours later the reports said 
meanwhile two leftwing members of parliament sent a letter to 
attorney general yosef harish claiming the sitin in qalqilya was 
part of a wellplanned strategy by a newly created settlers militia 
of a few hundred members

of the leftwing citizens rights movement said the mayor of the 
west bank settement of ariel ron nachman is one of the militias

genevabased international commission of jurists applauded the 
report but said it was at times seriously understated

hungarys ruling communist party has 
moved toward sharing power with other political groups by becoming 
the first eastern european country to endorse a multiparty system 
party leader karoly grosz announced after a twoday meeting of 
the central committee that the policymaking body had decided a 
multiparty system was the only way to guarantee political pluralism 
in hungary 
he also indicated the party had revised its view of the 1956 
antisoviet revolt to acknowledge the uprising started with good 
intentions but went sour 
a multiparty system would certainly provide an opportunity for 
alliances and participation by groups the communists would not be 
able to mobilize on their own grosz said in an interview excerpted 
on hungarian radio late saturday and due for full broadcast sunday 
evening 
the system is expected to be legal under a new constitution to be 
written next year 
a communique from the central committee stressed that the 
transition to a multiparty system must be gradual and steady 
to avoid what it termed the danger of the process becoming 
destabilized and uncontrollable 
that is not in the interest of any force with a sense of 
responsibility said the communique released by the state news 
agency mti 
grosz said he expected the constitution to require new parties to 
operate on a socialist basis 
if they do not accept the constitution then they cannot 
operate legally he said without elaborating 
no date has been announced for multiparty local or national 
parliamentary elections but both are due by the end of 1990 
groszs remarks indicated that dozens of political movements 
many of which began in recent months will be allowed to participate 
unlike alternative parties in east germany czechoslovakia and 
poland hungarys groups are independent of the communists 
a new promarxist group with an antistalinist platform was 
founded saturday another group named after a leader of the 
national peasants party crushed in the communist takeover in 1948 
announced plans to form a party calling for individual land 
ownership 
hungarians from the alternative groups and western diplomats saw 
groszs statement as a victory for communist party reformers they 
include politburo member imre pozsgay who two weeks ago presented a 
startling reassessment of the 1956 antisoviet revolt 
pozsgay said the revolt was a popular uprising not a 
counterrevolution as it has been officially called for 32 years the 
comment triggered enormous public debate 
grosz indicated the committee had reached a compromise on the 
official view of the 1956 revolt 
he said it started as an uprising in which many honest people 
fought against a dated regime but ended with counterrevolutionary 
elements gradually gaining strength 
during the past 30 years the official view had become distorted 
and we forgot those popular elements he said 
many party conservatives owe their jobs to supporting the idea 
that the revolt was a counterrevolution justly crushed by the soviet 
military 
imre nagy led the revolt against the regime of the stalinist 
matyas rakosi it started oct 23 1956 and was brought to a bloody 
end nov 4 of that year 
in a statement to vasarnapi hirek the nations sunday newspaper 
party spokesman emil kimmel said the initial uprising took the 
form of the intention to establish democratic socialism 
before the central committee session opened friday 15 political 
groups issued a statement saying they could not cooperate with the 
communist government unless the party changed its stand on 1956 
ferenc koeszeg of the alliance of free democrats said the partys 
apparently revised stand seemed an attempt to find a compromise 
its little for us certainly but its the beginning of a process 
the reevaluation of 1956 and the emergence of alternative 
political groups have come at a time of increasing dissatisfaction 
over hungarys stagnant economy and austerity measures 
during the weekend the government announced the third round of 
price increases this year raising the cost of canned and preserved 
goods by up to 30 percent 
the official trade unions have publicly broken with the 
government over price increases and have demanded an immediate 
increase in the minimum wage now about 70 a month

the crew of a runaway train that caused a 
devastating explosion earlier this month apparently set the trains 
air brakes but it remains a mystery why the brakes failed federal 
inspectors said 
but montana rail link officials federal inspectors and employees 
disagree over whether the trains hand brakes also should have been 
set while the crew changed locomotives near the continental divide 
on feb 2 
fortyeight cars got away from the crew about nine miles west of 
helena and rolled back into town colliding with a threelocomotive 
unit 
twentyone cars derailed and one containing hydrogen peroxide 
exploded shortly before 5 am shattering windows up to two miles 
away spewing shrapnel for hundreds of yards and knocking out power 
for up to six hours in parts of helena 
about 2000 people were evacuated within a square mile of the 
accident in 30belowzero weather officials estimated the damage at 
3 million although only a few people suffered minor injuries 
david ditzel a member of the national transportation safety 
boards field investigation into the accident said an event 
recorder indicates that before the trains six locomotives were 
separated from the 48 cars a substantial application of the air 
brakes was made 
they air brakes should have held the train he said late 
last week but it is obvious they didnt 
postaccident tests indicated air brakes on four cars were 
defective and other brakes may have been coated with ice and snow 
possibly hampering their effectiveness ditzel adds 
william loftus executive director of the federal railroad 
administration said the hand brakes also should have been set but 
were not but montana rail link officials debate that contention 
william brodsky president of the company said he does not 
believe failure to set the hand brakes was a violation of operation 
procedure 
the general code of operating rules a set of regulations 
followed by 13 major railroads including montana rail link says 
air brakes must not be depended upon to hold a train engine or 
car when left unattended 
brodsky said the phrase left unattended means when cars that 
are left for an extended period without supervision perhaps as long 
as several days over long periods of time air brakes can lose 
their holding ability the hand brakes are used as a backup

former klan leader david duke has sidestepped 
several attempts to derail his candidacy for the louisiana 
legislature and is mounting a doortodoor push for the final week 
of the campaign 
opponents were thwarted last week in two actions designed to 
discredit dukes candidacy a lawsuit challenging his residency was 
not filed although it still might be later and militant jewish 
protesters were unable to obtain a lastminute parade permit 
duke 38 and john treen 62 are contenders saturday for a state 
house seat from a nearly allwhite district in jefferson parish a 
new orleans suburb both men are republicans 
i think were going to win with about 54 percent of the 
vote or better duke said i think that the attacks the 
character assassinations make people more determined than ever to 
make their own choice 
the race between the articulate duke and treen a conservative 
home builder whose brother dave was the first republican governor 
since reconstruction has generated contributions and comment from 
around the country 
the new yorkbased jewish defense organization held an indoor 
rally sunday to warn people about duke a protest march by the group 
through downtown new orleans was canceled because the groups leader 
mordechai levy failed to obtain a parade permit 15 days in advance 
of the event 
as a man i do not hate mr duke the rev marie galatas a 
black activist told the crowd of less than 100 but i think he is 
a threat and he is very dangerous for what he believes in and what 
he stands for 
duke who was imperal wizard of the knights of the ku klux klan 
before he left the group in 1980 led a field of seven candidates in 
last months primary with 33 percent of the vote treen came in 
second with 19 percent of the vote 
under louisianas open primary system the top two votegetters 
in the primary go into the runoff whatever their party if no 
candidates gets more than half the vote 
attorney dave sherman representing some of the failed 
candidates has delayed until after the election filing a lawsuit 
challenging dukes residency in the house district 
sherman said dukes claims that he lived in a condominium in the 
district appear to be fraudulent because utility records indicate 
the residence had no electricity until last september 
duke who said he wont talk about his living arrangements 
because of threats will spend the last week of the race going 
doortodoor in the 21000voter district 
people now know that we can win people have been waiting for a 
long time for a candidate to come across and talk about these 
issues duke said if david duke wins this race it will break 
the ice 
issues on dukes platform include requiring welfare recipients to 
work offering incentives for women on welfare to be sterilized 
providing tax credits for education eliminating affirmative action 
programs and keeping a property tax exemption for home owners 
i think nobody really understood how deep the support is for 
the programs i represent duke said 
treen accused duke of jumping on the republican bandwagon saying 
lower taxes less government and selfsufficiency have been gop 
goals for years 
dukes candidacy has brought widespread opposition 
president bushs son george jr appeared in metairie a week ago 
and backed treen saying the gop has no place for klansmen 
roman catholic archbishop philip hannan and other religious 
leaders had a vigil last week in apparent opposition to dukes 
candidacy although treen was never mentioned by name 
we cannot allow the philosophy of the white hood to gain 
acceptability said rabbi robert loewy 
gov buddy roemer has said the election of duke would send a 
terrible signal to the country about louisiana 
duke who joined the ku klux klan as a teenager left after 
being accused of trying to sell secret klan membership rolls he 
began calling himself a white civil rights worker and founded the 
national association for the advancement of white people but he 
said it is not racist but aims at civil rights for all people 
during the campaign he has answered accusations that a telephone 
number listed to the klan rings in his home by saying he is just 
trying to make it easier for people to contact him

the security council this week will approve 
a un peacekeeping force in namibia of 4650 troops officials 
said far fewer than the number demanded by black african nations 
after weeks of lobbying for 7500 peacekeepers african countries 
and nonaligned nations have agreed to send the smaller contingent 
proposed by secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
soviet union britain france and china had pushed for the less 
costly smaller force which is still expected to cost about 416 
million for one year 
the 7500 peacekeepers would have cost about 700 million un 
officials have said 
the black african nations contended that cutting the size of the 
namibian force would signal the population there that the united 
nations was more concerned about costcutting than ending south 
africas 74year rule over the territory africas last colony 
black african nations also feared that a reduced peacekeeping 
force would tempt south africa to tamper with elections in namibia 
in november to prevent the main guerrilla group the southwest 
africa peoples organization from winning a majority 
namibians are to election a constituent assembly that will adopt 
a constitution and organize a black majorityruled government 
in a report released friday perez de cuellar assured the black 
african nations that the permanent security council members would 
allow him to dispatch up to 7500 troops if the military situation 
in namibia warrants 
perez de cuellar also authorized the peacekeepers to carry 
weapons an exception to the normal policy under which peacekeepers 
are unarmed 
un spokesman francois giuliani said friday that he expected the 
security council to approve the secretarygenerals recommendations 
monday or tuesday the five permanent security council members who 
together pay 57 percent of the cost of peacekeeping contended that 
a peace accord signed in december by south africa angola and cuba 
reduced the need for peacekeepers 
under the accords 50000 cuban troops are to be withdrawn from 
angola by mid1991 with half of them out by november as south 
africa cooperates with the uns oneyear plan for namibias 
independence beginning april 1

president francois mitterrand on sunday called on 
iran to prove that france had agreed to free a terrorist in exchange 
for the release of french hostages in beirut 
iran has claimed that france promised to free anis naccache a 
lebanese national and convicted leader of a proiranian terror 
squad in exchange for three french hostages released in may 
naccache is serving a life sentence for leading an assassination 
attempt against former iranian prime minister shapour bakhtiar in 
1980 bakhtiar survived but a french woman and a police officer were 
killed 
mitterrand said that when chirac submitted his resignation 
following elections that returned a socialist government to power 
last spring he did not ask for naccaches release 
speaking on the weekly television news show seven on seven 
mitterrand said that chirac assured him that the only committment 
france had made was to promise to restore diplomatic relations 
with iran 
i have no reason to doubt the words of mr chirac the 
president said adding that it was necessary for the iranians to 
provide proof that france has failed to meet its committments 
if such is the case it is understood that frances word will 
be kept but to my knowledge this is not the case 
foreign minister roland dumas discussed the matter with his 
iranian counterpart ali akbar velayati while on a trip to iran last 
week velayati said there was a gentlemens agreement to free 
naccache confirmed in telephone calls from chirac to iranian 
officials 
the president of irans parliament hachemi rafsandjani on 
saturday repeated the claim that iran was guaranteed naccaches 
release 
interior minister pierre joxe said last week unfortunately we 
have no official report no trace of the conditions in which the 
release of the hostages was negotiated by the chirac government 
he said he asked for a written report from his predecessor 
charles pasqua who led the effort to free the hostages but was 
turned down 
mitterrand noted in the interview sunday that naccache and four 
other members of the terrorist gang were convicted of crimes 
they are not hostages we do not take hostages he said 
there are 15 foreign hostages in lebanon they include nine 
americans three britons one belgian one irishman and one italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press who was abducted march 16 1985

the yacht thursdays child sailed 
triumphantly under the golden gate bridge on sunday breaking by 
eight days the new yorktosan francisco speed record set in 1854 
the 60foot sloop crossed the finish line at 1232 pm and was 
met by cheers and yells from hundreds of spectators thursdays 
child set sail nov 23 on a 14500mile voyage that took it around 
treacherous cape horn on the tip of south america 
i wouldnt do anything different but i wouldnt do it again 
once is enough said skipperowner warren luhrs after he stepped 
ashore 
luhrs and the other two crew members waved to the crowd after 
bettering the 89day eighthour trip by the 229foot clipper ship 
flying cloud during the gold rush 
the crew docked the 10ton vessel at blossom rock about two 
miles from the golden gate because they said the submerged point is 
where clipper ships used to drop anchor 
about 80 ships were out on san francisco bay to greet the modern 
racing sloop while other spectators gathered on the roof of fort 
point and at the south tower of the golden gate bridge a biplane 
flew overhead trailing a sign that read we love you tc 
thursdays childs entrance into the bay was delayed for hours by 
a fourknot outgoing tide and by a lack of wind 
the crew tried everything including putting out a large sail 
called a spinnaker but all its sails drooped finally under a 
bright cloudless sky the yacht was able to sail under the golden 
gate 
dozens of sailboats and powerboats had headed out the golden gate 
for the occasion and the coast guard sent a 95foot cutter and four 
utility boats to escort the yacht into the bay and lessen the danger 
of a spectator boat accidentally ramming thursdays child 
the yacht left from sandy hook bay 18 miles south of new york 
city and arrived in san francisco after 80 days and 20 hours said 
thomas conroy race timekeeper at the st francis yacht club he 
said thursdays child broke three other sailing records new york to 
the equator set in 1856 new york to cape horn 1857 and cape horn 
to san francisco 1854 the times and old records were not 
immediately available 
in a shiptoshore interview earlier sunday crew member courtney 
hazleton said he had that cominghome feeling 
its kind of like a mixed bag of emotions right now said 
hazleton both relief letdown that the whole things over and 
just a general feeling of accomplishment 
the crew hazleton 32 of palmetto fla luhrs 44 of 
alachua fla and lars bergstrom 54 of sarasota fla who helped 
design the vessel had spent saturday zigzagging north against a 
stubborn headwind that delayed the ships arrival by one day 
luhrs launched thursdays child for the 1984 solo transatlantic 
race in which she was the first american entry and the first 
singlehulled boat to finish 
the flying cloud was a merchantman that also ferried gold rush 
adventurers around the dangerous cape horn at the tip of south 
america and up to san francisco it could carry 35 sails on its tall 
masts and was the fastest of thousands of clippers that raced each 
other across the atlantic and pacific 
the ship wrecked on rocks off st johns newfoundland in 1874 
and nothing is left of it 
in the past seven years five racing boats trying to beat flying 
clouds record sank in the howling gales and treacherous rocks of 
cape horn 
a second boat also attempting to break flying clouds record was 
damaged last week in a storm off cape horn the bark of the west a 
60foot monohull was in its 56th day of sailing 
thursdays child also had trouble during its run at the record 
it had to stop at the falkland islands for repairs after it struck 
an unknown object 
the modern vessel survived cape horn but hazleton expressed awe 
and respect for the power of the sea when he recalled the passage 
around the cape 
it got pretty bad very unpleasant hazelton said in an 
interview by radio last week he said they spent six days and nights 
sailing into the teeth of wind gusting to 60 knots through seas 
that raged from all directions

of foreign affairs has had no contacts wth the plo and that he had 
no knowledge of planned attacks on plo leaders 
plo officials have held unofficial meetings with members of the 
centerleft labor party and leftwing members of parliament

israeli authorities and in the past there were also these kinds of 
indirect contacts also during the occupation of beirut there were 
negotiations through philip habib the special us envoy from

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
will visit jordan and egypt this month officials said indicating 
an increasing soviet role in the middle east conflict 
king hussein said the soviet minister will visit jordan on feb 
19 and the king indicated he had little objection to renewed soviet 
relations with israel if they lead to an arabisraeli peace 
conference 
if there is a move toward the establishment of peace obviously 
any objections to anyone restoring relations with anyone in this 
part of the world become of secondary importance hussein said in 
an interview with japanese reporters 
restoration of sovietisraeli relations severed during the 1967 
arabisraeli war are an israeli condition for the soviet role in 
middle east peace talks demanded by hussein and other arab leaders 
hussein said he was quite optimistic that an international 
conference peace could take place soon given recent us and soviet 
efforts to solve other regional problems 
he urged israeli leaders to abandon their opposition to involving 
the palestine liberation organization in peace talks 
i cant see any solution to the palestinian problem without the 
participation of the palestinians the king said 
hussein refused to commit jordan to a confederation with a 
proposed palestinian state an idea floated earlier partly to 
overcome israeli and american opposition to an independent 
palestinian entity 
in cairo soviet ambassador gennady zhuravlev told reporters 
shevaradnadze is expected to visit the egyptian capital some time 
this month though no exact date has been set zhuravlev spoke to 
reporters after a meeting with egypts foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid 
the last soviet foreign minister to visit cairo was andrei 
gromyko in 1975 three years after late president anwar sadat 
expelled 15000 soviet military advisers in anger over moscows 
refusal to supply egypt the arms it wanted 
relations between cairo and moscow remained sour during the 1970s 
and improved only after president hosni mubarak took office in 1981 
diplomatic ties were resumed at the ambassadorial level in 1984

attorney general dick thornburgh and the 
prosecution in oliver norths irancontra case agreed sunday on more 
stringent safeguards for classified material whose threatened 
release delayed the trial 
chief justice william h rehnquist on sunday granted a justice 
department request to delay norths trial from mondays scheduled 
start until friday when the full supreme court is scheduled to 
consider the departments objections to the planned release of 
classified material by norths defense 
hours later thornburgh and independent counsel lawrence walsh 
announced a motion had been filed asking the judge in the case us 
district judge gerhard a gesell to impose more stringent 
safeguards on norths use of classified material 
the requested relief if granted would provide necessary 
assurance that the attorney general would remain in a position 
throughout the trial to protect against unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information the justice department said in a 
statement thornburgh and walsh agreed that this protection does 
not interfere in any way with the independent counsels ability to 
carry out his duties said the statement 
if the proposal is approved by gesell the justice department 
will ask the supreme court to lift the stay immediately so the north 
trial may proceed according to separate statements issued by the 
department and walsh 
walsh and the department filed a sealed motion with gesell 
which requests that the district court enter an additional 
protective order preventing the release of classified information 
vital to us national security interests the justice department 
said 
norths attorneys brendan sullivan and barry simon did not 
return phone calls to their business answering service seeking 
comment 
rehnquist on sunday ordered that the trial proceedings in 
united states versus oliver l north be stayed pending 
consideration by the full supreme court on friday 
a jury in the case was selected thursday and returns to court 
monday morning 
walsh whose office is prosecuting north had opposed the justice 
departments efforts to delay the trial and wanted to proceed 
immediately with opening arguments saying that national security 
concerns had been amply addressed 
the justice department reflecting concerns of us intelligence 
agencies feels that gesell has imposed inadequate controls on north 
and that the fired national security council aide would be permitted 
to pour out secrets in the courtroom that are damaging to national 
security 
the department of justice concluded and the independent 
counsel concurred that the trial could not go forward without an 
additional protective order and that it is essential for the court 
to enter such an order said the justice department 
it said that without such an order the justice department 
concluded and the independent counsel concurred that it will be 
impossible during the defenses opening statement and presentation 
of evidence to protect against the unnecessary and uncontrolled 
disclosure of classified information the information was 
described in the justice department statement as of vital 
importance to the national security and the foreign relations of the 
united states 
the department said that an enormous number of the 300 
classified documents north may use at his trial are not yet 
clearly covered by a protective order of the court 
the department said it believes that the joint motion will 
resolve any remaining differences with respect to the handling of 
classified information 
walsh issued a separate statement saying that the independent 
counsel filed the motion with gesell and that the justice department 
agreed to the motion 
government sources familiar with the agreement say the justice 
department retreated from the drastic position it took wednesday 
the department at that time sought a court order saying north 
would be permitted to introduce no classified information unless the 
court ruled that it was relevant and the us government had no 
objection to its disclosure 
under the motion filed with gesell the justice department 
compromised by narrowing the broad objections it had to many 
categories of classified material that north plans to introduce at 
his trial said government sources familiar with the proposed 
agreement 
gesell on wednesday rejected the depatments request for the 
order seeking stringent controls over classified material north 
plans to present and the justice department on thursday began its 
efforts to delay the trial the department sought to appeal but an 
appeals court twice rebuffed the departments attempt to obtain a 
stay late last week 
the department on saturday went to the supreme court in an 
attempt to delay the trial and the special prosecutors office 
quickly filed counter arguments 
the possibility of a compromise by the justice department came up 
saturday when a government source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the department wanted to try to work with walshs 
office to resolve differences which surfaced wednesday 
the source said there would be a twoprong approach with the 
attempt at cooperation taking place at the same time the department 
worked on preparing an affidavit to the court from the attorney 
general that would in effect bar disclosure of certain classified 
material north plans to use on the grounds that it would harm 
national security 
depending on the scope of the affidavit such a drastic step 
could have led to dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal 
charges against north because he would be barred from using 
classified material in an attempt to prove his innocence 
gesell issued orders dec 12 and jan 19 spelling out how much 
censorship could be applied to classified material that the 
prosecution and defense planned to use at trial the justice 
department criticized gesells efforts in a supreme court filing on 
saturday 
the categories of information covered by the two orders were by 
no means exhaustive said the justice department much 
classified information remained unprotected and was not the subject 
of any pretrial ruling on admissibility

the designated successor to ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini called for an end to extremism in remarks 
published sunday and urged irans leaders to make up for past 
mistakes that isolated the islamic republic 
ayatollah husseinali montazeris comments published by the 
official islamic republic news agency and tehrans abrar daily 
echoed recent calls by other iranian leaders for critical 
selfexamination as the iranian revolution moves into its second 
decade 
montazeri went further however by questioning the official 
doctrine that iran won the eightyear war against iraq 
people in the world got the idea that our business in iran is 
just murdering people montazeri was quoted as saying in criticism 
of the selfimposed isolation he spoke in the holy city of qom on 
saturday at the climax of 10 days of celebrations marking the 
revolutions 10th anniversary 
montazeri 64 has been increasingly critical of the revolutions 
shortcomings and repeatedly has called for a relaxation of its 
stringent religious social and political restrictions 
in another indication of a more open political atmosphere the 
iranian news agency reported sunday that irans only legalized 
opposition party demanded that the government allow opposition 
newspapers and provide security needed for open political activity 
it quoted ibrahim yazdi an official of the iran freedom movement 
party as saying the opposition group is not opposed to the rule of 
the islamic clergy provided a free press freedom of gatherings 
and freedom of thought we will not turn our backs he was quoted 
as saying 
the group said it would participate in any open presidential 
elections 
montazeris latest criticism was his strongest and all the more 
telling because it was delivered on the anniversary of the day in 
1979 when the late shah mohammad reza pahlavis government collapsed 
and khomeinis revolutionaries took over 
speaking about the iraniraq montazeri asked a question that a 
year ago would have been considered political heresy did we 
succeed in doing well during the imposed war or did the enemies who 
imposed it turn out to be the victors 
hostilities halted aug 20 after iran battered by a string of 
military defeats accepted a unsponsored ceasefire a year after 
iraq said it was willing to do so 
we should consider how many people we lost how many splendid 
young men were martyred how many cities were destroyed we should 
take all these into account then if we say we have made a mistake 
we should repent montazeri said 
we used slogans that frightened the world have we succeeded 
in protecting the revolution and realizing its objectives have we 
delivered the promises we gave to the people 
his hardhitting comments follow unusually frank interviews by 
other iranian leaders including parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani and chief justice musavi ardebili in which they 
acknowledged that irans war strategy was flawed and that us 
intervention tipped the scales against tehran 
montazeris remarks contrasted with a saturday speech by 
president ali khamenei to a rally in tehran which was long on 
praise for the revolutions survival and short on criticism of its 
failings 
khamenei admitted there were differences in irans leadership but 
denied a power struggle exists 
montazeri touched on one of the points of disagreement by 
advocating that iranians who fled abroad be allowed to return to 
help rebuild an economy nearly ruined by the war 
those abroad are terrified he said in an apparent reference 
to a wave of executions in iran over the past six months 
iranian leaders have admitted some political prisoners have been 
executed dissident iranians claim as many as 12000 people have 
been killed the united nations and amnesty international estimate 
there have been 1000 executions 
set aside past mistakes and harsh treatment extremism is to 
our detriment try to treat the exiles with affection and islamic 
behavior montazeri said 
montazeri praised khomeinis decision last week to pardon all 
political prisoners except those with sinister intentions a 
reference to about 900 considered hardcore opponents 
filling the prisons will not heal any wounds montazeri 
declared

small investors removed funds from the nations 
banking system particularly savings and loans at the rate of 6 
billion a week late last month according to information gathered 
for an investment survey 
since early january investors pulled nearly 19 billion from 
commercial banks and thrifts according to data provided to money 
magazine for its small investor index 
savings and loans lost 25 percent of their savings and 
moneymarket account assets the survey found much of this money 
flowed to moneymarket funds offered by mutual fund companies and 
brokerages the magazine said 
the magazine said the investors actions are driven by several 
factors 
a fear that they might not see their money for weeks or months 
should their savings and loan fail 
concern that federal action to bail out the troubled thrift 
industry could end up hurting small savers 
the belief that banks and thrifts will pay lower yields in the 
future after the closure of weak savings and loans that paid 
extremely high rates to lure cash 
the higher rates of return being offered by moneymarket mutual 
funds 
on friday the federal home loan bank board reported that savings 
and loan customers withdrew a record 81 billion from their 
accounts in december 
it was the eighth consecutive month of net withdrawals from the 
thrifts the bank board said

parties involved in the dispute over the long 
island lighting co and its idle shoreham nuclear power plant spent 
sunday pondering a federal judges ruling and a proposed settlement 
that may finally end the debate 
there are lots of things to think about said judith vladeck 
an attorney representing lilco ratepayers who was in her manhattan 
office sunday going over the weekends developments with her clients 
on saturday us district judge jack b weinstein threw out a 
228 million judgment against lilco saying the case involving 
electricity rates belonged before the state public service 
commission not the courts 
on monday the parties were scheduled to gather in weinsteins 
chambers to review a settlement outlined saturday by a federal 
mediator that would close the 54 billion shoreham plant on long 
island which has never operated commercially 
suffolk county officials also planned to meet monday to consider 
appealing weinsteins ruling 
im quite confident that it is in the interest of all the 
parties to settle this case monday the mediator kenneth r 
feinberg said sunday 
feinberg said the settlement calls for the shutdown of shoreham 
and a 400 million reduction in lilcos planned rate increases over 
the next 10 years 
the settlement would take effect if gov mario cuomo approves it 
within 15 days of its approval by lilco and suffolk county 
the financially troubled utility company and cuomo declined 
comment on the proposed settlement a spokesman for suffolk county 
executive patrick halpin expressed cautious acceptance 
under a similar settlement proposed by the governor last year 
the state would have bought shoreham for 1 and closed it lilco was 
to get annual rate increases of about 5 percent the proposal was 
criticized as too expensive to ratepayers and it died when the 
legislature failed to act on it 
feinbergs proposal reduces the proposed increases by about 400 
million and contains provisions to settle a lawsuit by lilco against 
the town of brookhaven which the utility says overassessed shoreham 
by more than 500 million 
weinsteins ruling came more than two months after a federal jury 
found that lilco had lied to obtain rate increases to help pay for 
shoreham the verdict exposed lilco to the possibility of a 
classaction suit that could have resulted in billions of dollars in 
damages 
though he allowed the trial to continue weinstein ruled saturday 
that the issue should not be decided in federal court under the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
what the trial proved was that rico cannot and should not 
be applied in a case such as this to permit a federal jury in a 
civil case to second guess the ratemaking authority of the state 
weinstein ruled 
construction on the shoreham plant 60 miles east of manhattan 
began in 1973 and it was largely finished a decade later 
but legal objections to the plant were raised by state and local 
governments and many long island residents who contend they could 
not safely evacuate the area should there be a plant emergency the 
delays pushed the cost of shoreham to 54 billion more than 70 
times the original estimate 
the dispute has taken lilco to the brink of bankruptcy several 
times

millions of dollars to try to document alleged unfair trading 
practices by leading steelexporting nations 
the move is part of a campaign by the american steel industry to 
win an extension of a series of pacts that set productbyproduct 
limits on the amount of foreign steel that can be shipped into the 
united states 
the pacts were negotiated by the reagan administration with 
japan south korea brazil and other nations in 1984 in response to 
complaints by american steelmakers that they could not compete with 
a flood of subsidized foreign imports 
the agreements expire sept 30 and usx corp bethlehem steel 
corp and other leading steelmakers want to be certain they are 
renewed the bush administration has pledged to support the pacts 
although no specifics have been offered on whether they would be 
continued in their present form 
the wild cards in the negotiations will be the nations 
themselves they are under no obligation to restrict their imports 
again as they did voluntarily five years ago 
in order to pressure the trading partners american steelmakers 
have been paying millions of dollars to lawyers to compile unfair 
trading cases against the countries according to usx and 
bethlehem executives 
in the cases the lawyers are detailing allegations of foreign 
government subsidies to steelmakers and dumping or selling 
products in the united states at below fairmarket value 
the unfair trading cases may never actually be filed with the 
us international trade commission an independent agency with 
authority to order tariffs or other import relief for injured 
domestic industries 
but the american companies are compiling the cases anyway so the 
united states can use the information as leverage in negotiations 
trade cases are an alternative an expensive undesirable 
alternative robert boni chief executive officer of armco inc 
said in a recent interview 
while steel industry officials are reluctant to publicly discuss 
the specifics of such cases boni said armco of parsippany nj 
spent 2 million recently just on lawyers who are compiling them he 
said larger steelmakers probably were spending more 
under the fiveyear trade pacts imports have been reduced from 
264 percent of the american steel market in 1984 to about 205 
percent last year meanwhile employment levels and profit among 
us steelmakers were up last year over 1987 
while us steelmakers say they continue to need the protection 
of import curbs some other american manufacturers contend the 
restraints have created steel shortages in the united states and 
driven up prices

under which its transportation group which provides investment 
banking services to the airline and aerospace industry will become 
a separate corporation that will retain ties to the wall street firm 
as part of the agreement painewebber will provide approximately 
32 percent of the new corporations 10 million in equity capital 
and will work jointly with the transportation group on public 
offerings placements of highyield or junk bond securities 
and other transactions for the airlines and aerospace industries 
officials said

director of painewebber and director of its transportation group 
since 1984

employees who decided to form the new company wanted the opportunity 
to invest their own funds in the transportation group

investment areas that are not part of the traditional businesses of 
painewebber such as fund and money management for institutional 
investors 
painewebber is one of wall streets largest investment firms 
with both individual and institutional clients 
last month painewebber reported sharply lower earnings for the 
fourth quarter of 1988 and for the year as a whole it said the 
results reflected a slowdown in the financial markets and onetime 
costs

from the 7 million in the same period of 1987 for all of 1988 
profit dropped 41 percent to 424 million compared with 72 
million in 1987 
revenue for 1988 totaled 251 billion up from 244 billion in 
1987 
the company said it would continue a program to boost 
profitability by reducing support staff consolidating offices and 
shrinking marginal businesses

declined 
the dollar opened at 12860 yen up 095 yen from fridays close 
of 12765 yen 
a rise in prime lending rates by many american commercial banks 
and the news of a higherthanexpected us producer price index for 
january both announced on friday combined to spur the dollars 
rally said a dealer from the bank of tokyo 
the dealer who spoke anonymously said the report showing the 
nations producer price index for finished goods rose 1 percent last 
month was stunning news 
also friday numerous banks in the united states raised their 
prime lending rates from 105 percent to 11 percent 
the rate is closely watched because bankers use it as a basis for 
calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining various 
types of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans including home 
equity loans 
higher us interest rates tend to make the dollar more 
attractive to foreign investors 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225

about 30 texas savings and loan executives some 
representing thrifts that later failed met secretly in june 1985 to 
discuss ways to continue making deals and keep federal regulators 
off their backs a newspaper reported sunday 
about 19 thrifts were represented at the houston meeting 
including 15 that have since failed been declared insolvent or 
closed and merged with other institutions the houston post reported 
leonard thomas of colonial savings of western kansas an 
executive who attended told the post he thought the session was a 
secret meeting colonial based in liberal kan was the only 
outofstate thrift represented 
there was a general concern that if the regulators found out 
that all the sampl guys got together they might misconstrue the 
situation thomas said in 1985 there were a lot of scared 
people running around 
the june 11 1985 meeting was called by continental savings 
president david wylie and chairman carroll kelly in a may 22 1985 
letter written on continental savings stationery a copy of the 
letter was obtained by the post 
continental savings based in the houston suburb of bellaire 
later failed 
we discovered the letter over a year ago said rosemary 
stewart director of enforcement for the federal home loan bank 
board which regulates savings and loans we turned it over to the 
department of justice as part of an ongoing criminal investigation 
sources who attended the meeting told the post that several 
issues were discussed including how to evade loan limits to one 
borrower and how to remove delinquent loans and foreclosed real 
estate from thrift books by selling them to other thrifts 
industry sources familiar with the meeting said the effect of 
those actions would have been to move bad loans around to hide them 
from regulators and make the thrifts appear to be in better 
financial shape than they were 
ms stewart said such actions could be illegal depending on the 
particular circumstances 
selling reo real estate owned can be perfectly lawful under 
certain circumstances but if they were selling reo to fool the 
regulators that would be a violation of federal home loan bank 
board rules and very likely a criminal violation willful 
misstatement of the books and records she said 
i remember them talking about selling reos said bg wylie 
former chairman of american savings and loan in lake jackson and the 
father of david wylie 
if something was done it was after i left i dont know 
whether any of them got together on the reos wylie said 
another source who attended said the sale of reos was discussed 
along with evasion of loan limits and growth limits wylie said he 
didnt remember anyone at the meeting discussing loan limits to one 
borrower
