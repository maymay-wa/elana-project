a key figure in the pentagon procurement 
scandal violated a conflictofinterest pledge not to associate 
with his previous employer boeing co while working at the 
pentagon it was reported 
a senate oversight subcommittee recently reviewed the records of 
a 1983 criminal investigation of possible conflicts of interest by 
melvyn r paisley in his dealings with boeing co questioning 
pentagon lawyers at a recent unpublicized hearing the subcommittee 
made available records of the hearings to the los angeles times 
the subcommittee said paisley the former assistant navy 
secretary urged government officials days after meeting with the 
president of boeings helicopter unit to speed the development of a 
tiltrotor helicopter on which boeing was the eventual winning 
bidder senate investigators told the times on friday 
paisley once the navys most powerful procurement official 
also recommended several top boeing executives for positions on 
sensitive pentagon advisory boards during times he had disqualified 
himself from dealings with the firm the subcommittee said 
among them was james e gaines who later became a deputy 
assistant navy secretary 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella jr said it was 
appropriate for paisley to recommend boeing officials for service 
as pentagon advisers 
the fact he had previously been employed by boeing certainly 
should not prohibit one of the countrys major defense contractors 
from participating in naval advisory boards barcella said 
gaines and paisley are under investigation in operation ill 
wind the farranging probe of pentagon procurement expected to 
result in indictments within a month federal agents said 
paisley joined the pentagon in 1981 after a 27year career at 
boeing 
investigators are trying to determine whether paisley received 
payments from military contractors while serving as assistant navy 
secretary and whether he improperly obtained confidential pentagon 
data after he left the pentagon in 1987 to become a defense 
consultant 
sen carl m levin dmich chairman of the oversight 
subcommittee told pentagon lawyers he was deeply disturbed by the 
disclosures of paisleys dealings with boeing according to a 
transcript of the sept 29 hearing

an opposition party leader has called 
for a plebiscite to decide the sandinista governments future 
erick ramirez head of the nicaraguan social christian party 
proposed a referendum that says no to the continuation of the 
sandinista government and totalitarian project and no to the 
violence and the repression 
ramirez set no specific date for the referendum which he 
proposed while presiding over his partys 31st anniversary 
celebration there was no immediate response to the call from the 
sandinistas 
the opposition party leader also said he might ask the recently 
formed fiveparty coalition the democratic alliance of the 
opposition to condemn sandinista leaders who have driven 
nicaragua to a fatal precipice 
the sandinista national liberation front has ruled nicaragua 
since july 1979 when it overthrew the rightist dictator anastasio 
somoza 
nicaraguas five opposition political parties formed the 
alliance on oct 4 to invigorate the fight of the people using 
civil democratic and patriotic solutions to the severe crisis 
shaking nicaragua 
ramirez on sunday accused the sandinistas of failing to honor 
the esquipulas ii peace accords signed by central american 
countries last year 
they are opportunists who only have sought their own 
wellbeing he said 
just before the alliances formation ramirez announced a 
broad block of civicpolitical opposition with the 
participation of former sandinista eden pastora known by his war 
pseudonym commander zero pastora helped lead the fight against 
somoza 
at that time ramirez defined the new opposition block as the 
third option that would offer different alternatives to the 
radical polarized positions that exist in nicaragua 
the reference was to the leftist sandinista and a usbacked 
rebel band called the contras 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega later responded that 
nicaragua does not have three options you are either with the 
revolution or with the foreign aggressor the sandinista 
president said 
when proposing the plebiscite sunday ramirez said nicaraguas 
opposition parties should be on the offensive and coordinate 
forces in the common fight for national salvation 
the socialchristian leader also said he would continue to fight 
for total amnesty for political prisoners who have been jailed 
in the nine years since the fall of the somoza regime

she lives in a white castleshaped 
building with a room full of miniature european castles cathedrals 
and houses surrounded by tiny brass cars and handpainted people 
trudy thuijs late husband arthur constructed the 45 buildings 
on a scale of inch per foot 
with a strauss waltz playing in the background visitors walk 
around the blackpainted room and its islands of tiny buildings 
encircled by moving trains 
the miniature kingdom has a replica of the castle neuschwanstein 
in fussen germany the kremlin and red square in moscow and a 
hotel on the riviera with a beach covered by umbrellas and chairs 
the cathedral of the assumption of the holy virgin recreates the 
original 1479 building in moscow down to the domes gilded with real 
gold and silver 
to me these buildings are works of art its a view of 
architecture and times past said mrs thuijs 48 you cant 
experience it the real building the way you could here 
miniature kingdom is one of five tiny villages researched 
designed and built by her husband a native of holland who died in 
1984 he sold the others located in the hague holland lake 
lugano switzerland klagenfurt austria and dusseldorf west 
germany 
thuijs started crafting miniatures in the 1950s after years of 
designing hotels restaurants and government buildings in europe 
he built the miniature kingdom buildings in holland and was 
persuaded to move them to the great adventure theme park near 
jackson in 1974 by the parks builder warner leroy according to 
mrs thuijs 
she met her husband while working at great adventure where the 
miniature buildings were kept outdoors 
eventually the couple looked for an indoor home for the display 
and a place to retire they chose washington a rural northern new 
jersey community about 15 miles east of the pennsylvania border 
mrs thuijs said the exhibit was valued at 550000 when built 
in the 1960s and now is worth more than 1 million but she has no 
plans to sell miniature kingdom 
each building made of swedish masonite to withstand the 
weather took three to six months to build thuijs spent 1 years 
working on the castle neuschwanstein patterned after its 1869 
german namesake constructed for king ludwig ii of bavaria 
the castle and the georgian house a model of a 1710 london 
mansion are among mrs thuijs favorites 
i tend to the more ornate buildings she said 
she thinks her husband chose the buildings he recreated because 
he had seen them during his travels in belgium holland germany 
the soviet union poland england and switzerland 
only one miniature scene is out of place among those of europe 
new york harbor 
it was the first step in what was going to be a very expanded 
miniature village at great adventure mrs thuijs said he was 
to create another set of miniatures but because of financial 
problems at the theme park he didnt continue

the rev barry harris admits he 
sometimes gets the itch to play the horses and its a difficult 
urge to avoid working around 1100 of them on the back side at 
fairmount park race track 
harris began ministering to the nomadic peoples on the back 
side the area behind the grandstand where horses train and 
trainers sleep in may 1985 
i had the feeling that some of my brother ministers treated me 
with some suspicion and were a bit cool toward me the southern 
baptist said recalling his start 
just for the simple fact that im here where betting gambling 
takes place i just figured it wasnt my job to judge but to 
minister 
thrice weekly starting at 8 am harris broadcasts an 
economical prayer and devotional message over the 
publicaddress system to the tracks 1500 workers 
he then strolls around to the stables meeting members of the 
horseracing industry including jockeys horse owners and trainers 
the 44yearold harris born in nearby east st louis says 
people seek his counsel for many reasons including problems with 
relationships health or downright boredom 
whatever turns up thats what ill deal with said the 
silverhaired reverend wearing brown leather boots faded blue 
jeans a crisp white shirt a grayblueandbrown tie and a 
creamcolored jacket 
thats where i find out about the wedding thats being 
planned i did one in the winners circle he recalled laughing 
the groom was a jockey 
harris who also works at the track two evenings weekly holds a 
bible study tuesdays in the horsemens lounge on thursdays before 
racing starts he has a devotional service for the jockeys 
he says people who work the back side which at fairmount 
shelters about 1100 horses need a chaplain because their 
migratory life doesnt permit them to put down roots 
theyre a nomadic people he said theyre not plugged 
into the community where they are 
harris said it wasnt that he dreamed of growing up to become a 
track chaplain he never gave it much thought really though his 
father a steel worker traded horses part time 
he graduated from a belleville high school in 1961 got married 
and started working on the railroad then around age 24 in search 
of another career harris entered the ministry 
while serving as pastor at highland southern baptist church 
harris sought to supplement his churchs income to finance a 
building expansion in 1985 the track job came open and he took it 
replacing another southern baptist minister 
the job has existed since 1979 supported by the horsemens 
benevolent and protective association 
i love it here harris said yeah you get the urge every 
once in a while to bet but its not in my game 
he doesnt try to justify the legalized betting at the track 
which southern baptists dont look kindly upon its not there 
for me to approve or disapprove he said its there 
i am not god i cannot stop these things i am here to 
administer to persons

people living in the west were the most likely 
to have been crime victims last year while residents of the 
northeast were the least likely to have been victimized the 
government says 
nationally crime levels in the united states rose 18 percent 
in 1987 ending a fiveyear decline the bureau of justice 
statistics reported sunday 
the number of criminal victimizations rose some 613000 in 1987 
to more than 347 million with increases compared to 1986 in the 
amount of both personal and household crime 
even with the increase over 1986 there were 16 percent fewer 
crimes last year than in 1981 the peak year for crime with 415 
million criminal victimizations said joseph bessette the bureaus 
acting director 
in 1986 the number of crimes hit the lowest level in the 
15year history of the governments national crime survey 341 
million 
last year the number of personal crimes rose nearly 250000 or 
14 percent from 1986 to just over 19 million with increases in 
all four categories of rape robbery assault and theft 
the amount of household crime rose by nearly 360000 or 23 
percent to 157 million with increases in burglary larceny and 
motor vehicle theft 
reagan administration officials have tried to depict declines as 
a result of sterner law enforcement and a more cooperative public 
some academic experts analyzing the data have stressed that the 
size of the most crimeprone age group those in their middle to 
late teens has grown smaller in the 1980s 
the numbers of personal crimes per 1000 people last year were 
125 in the west 101 in the midwest 91 in the south and 71 in the 
northeast the household crime figures per 1000 residents were 223 
in the west 166 in the midwest 179 in the south and 116 in the 
northeast 
the west was the only region to show an increase in the personal 
crime rate last year compared to 1986 up 86 percent in the south 
the rate fell by 48 percent while the northeast and midwest 
showed no significant change

advocates of failed legislation to combat 
urban smog acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals are looking to 
the next president to supply leadership to help break congress 
biggest environmental impasse 
i suspect whoever gets elected george bush or michael 
dukakis will be better than ronald reagan says sen tim wirth 
dcolo summing up what is becoming a bipartisan litany among 
environmentalists 
whichever administration comes in will probably be much more 
supportive of environmental legislation than this one says sen 
robert stafford rvt who frequently found himself at odds with 
the reagan white house 
it looks like its going to take a new president adds 
richard ayres chairman of the national clean air coalition a 
consortium of environmental public health and labor groups 
sounding a note of pessimism is sen george mitchell dmaine 
who spent much of 1988 trying to unite disparate factions on what 
would have been the first major rewriting of the clean air act in 
11 years 
i believe that many who say they support clean air have 
naively placed too much confidence in vice president bushs 
environmental statements than they warrant mitchell said last 
week as he ended efforts to find an airquality compromise this 
year 
i dont think it will make much difference with him said 
mitchell adding that bushs call for a reduction of millions 
of tons of the acidrain chemical sulfur dioxide is vague compared 
to dukakis call for a 12 million ton cut in sulfur dioxide 
emissions from coalburning plants 
he could push for a 3 million ton cut and not still violate a 
campaign pledge says mitchell calling for a minimum reduction 
of 10 million tons 
both presidential candidates have been talking up a cleaner 
environment on the campaign trail which contrasts sharply with the 
reagan administrations early frontal attacks on environmental laws 
and running battles with congress 
the administrations record hasnt been entirely negative 
spurred by the warnings of scientists it supported the 
international agreement to reduce emissions of chemicals that are 
destroying the earths ozone layer 
but on a number of other environmental issues including acid 
rain toxic wastes and strip mining it has been widely accused of 
footdragging or worse 
the next president and the 101st congress are likely to find an 
increasingly global focus to the issue of air quality which 
heretofore has been framed in terms of smoggy cities and lakes and 
trees harmed by acid rain 
for the last two years scientists have been appearing before an 
ever widening circle of house and senate committees to deliver 
frightening warnings about global warming called the greenhouse 
effect 
they say a variety of factors from burning fossil fuels such as 
coal and petroleum to destruction of tropical rain forests are 
overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases that trap heat 
that normally would escape into space 
no one is directly linking this summers drought and record 
temperatures to global warming but witnesses say more such 
conditions along with coastal flooding can be expected sometime 
in the next century 
scientists are divided over when average temperatures will climb 
to dangerous levels but some warn that even if greenhouse gases 
were controlled tomorrow the earth may already be committed to its 
hottest period in 100000 years 
greenhouse control bills have been introduced on both sides of 
congress calling for a variety of remedies including better energy 
efficiency development of alternatives to fossil fuel and 
international cooperation 
wirth who has chaired some of the greenhouse hearings says 
global warming may be the catalyst that can break the airquality 
impasse that stems from competing economic and regional interests 
in this country 
i think thats where the possibility may be said wirth who 
along with sen john heinz rpa is trying to interest the 
presidential candidates in a joint plan relying heavily on economic 
incentives to curb greenhouse emissions 
witnesses have told wirths hearings there would be daytoday 
side benefits from attacking the greenhouse problem saving energy 
could reduce emissions of acid rain chemicals vehicles with better 
fuel mileage not only would cut carbon emissions contributing to 
the greenhouse effect but also would emit less smogproducing 
chemicals 
the global warming threat also offers the next administration a 
new frontier for relations with the soviet union the two nations 
are estimated to be responsible for 45 percent of the worlds 
greenhouse gases 
wirth says failure of the latest effort to strengthen the clean 
air act demonstrates the need for a partnership between the white 
house and congress in dealing with the far more complicated and 
ominous problem of global warming 
it shows how difficult it is to push something uphill without 
administration support he said

this agricultural hamlet of 350 people 
on the banks of the rio grande has languished for decades but 
residents say a planned bridge to texas to handle mexicos booming 
trade will spark change 
but nearby towns already with bridges spanning the border are 
concerned they may lose business 
one is hedging its bets its helping finance construction of 
colombias bridge to make money off the tolls 
we need industries to come for our youth said farmer 
tiburcio tapia lopez born in colombia in 1910 this town needs 
some life 
tapia and colombias 93 other communal farmers barely eke out a 
living on the sorghum and corn they sell at market he and his wife 
yolanda have nine children all but one of whom went to other 
mexican cities or to the united states to work 
eloy cantu nuevo leon state secretary for development and 
planning said the bridge linking colombia with a private tract of 
land near an unincorporated site called dolores texas could be 
under construction as soon as february 
cantu said the bridge will offer the most streamlined customs 
operation along the nearly 2000mile border and may include 
shared customs so cargo trucks are checked by american and 
mexican officials simultaneously 
itll be a showcase cantu said in an interview in the state 
capital of monterrey northern mexicos largest and most 
industrialized city 
nuevo leon is the only usmexico border state without an 
international bridge cantu said 
mexico in a severe economic crisis since 1982 joined the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt two years ago the 
move lowered import duties on hundreds of foreign products and for 
the first time made exports of manufactured goods a no 1 priority 
joining gatt was a sign the country is trying to reduce its 
reliance on petroleum export revenues which plummeted with the 
price of oil from 147 billion in 1983 to 78 billion last year 
exports of manufactured goods meanwhile soared by 116 percent 
during the 5year period from 1983 to 1987 
total manufactured exports in 1987 hit 99 billion according 
to banco de mexico figures 
in the first six months of this year manufactured exports were 
up by 23 percent over the same period last year according to the 
industry and commerce department 
now theres talk of building or improving international bridges 
all along the border to handle the unending streams of 18wheel 
cargo trucks that go back and forth from mexico to the united 
states 
tapia said colombia had a short heyday in his youth when his 
father operated a ferry that carried mexican workers to the coal 
mines at dolores and brought supplies from the united statess 
that ended about 1925 he said since then theres been no 
work here 
nuevo leon still has to make major road improvements to 
colombia build customs houses and upgrade water and electricity 
systems 
but while colombia is rejoicing the twin cities of nuevo laredo 
in tamaulipas state and laredo texas just 24 miles downstream 
are concerned 
laredo which will pay half the estimated 1 million cost of the 
bridge and earn toll revenues from it would fare the best 
although city managuer marvin townsend said laredo will fight any 
attempts to build a road bypassing it on the texas side 
both cities earn millions on the truck trade through bridge 
tolls customs brokers trucking companies motels restaurants 
banks insurance companies and government offices that monitor the 
industry 
both laredos agree another bridge is needed but they had hoped 
a third one would be built there first 
nuevo laredos main source of income is international trade 
said sergio lujan vice president of the nuevo laredo association 
of customs agents 
my colleagues are very very concerned about the competition 
they fear nuevo leon will try to sponsor its own border town and 
make it grow he said 
cantu said limited development is planned in colombia and that 
the states main goal is to slow growth in the sprawling 
watershort monterrey by encouraging growth in anahuac a city of 
about 30000 people 40 miles south of colombia

one year after the stock market crash 
americas business leaders are looking back on a year of 
surprisingly strong growth and ahead to what in some ways would be 
a welcome slowdown 
economists widely expected the economy to topple into a 
recession this year or at best into a period of sluggishness 
instead business has been good and many of the executives gathered 
last weekend for the semiannual meeting of the business council 
sounded like roger b smith chairman of general motors corp 
the us auto industry is just finishing their 1988 model 
year which needless to say was a very very good year for us 
said smith who in 1989 and 1990 will serve as chairman of the 
council composed of 62 chief executives from the countrys biggest 
corporations 
a panel of about 20 economists from member companies is 
predicting growth this year as measured by the gross national 
product of 4 percent if realized that would be the best since 
1984 
however economic growth will slow to 25 percent next year and 
to below 2 percent in 1990 the panel predicted theyve been 
making a similar prediction for two years now 
citicorp chairman john s reed who delivers the councils 
economic report said that once again the groups consultants 
suggest that next year things will begin to slow down a little 
bit 
even another year of unexpected growth would only put off for 
another year the expected slowdown he said 
but if the economists undershoot again the implications could 
be grim 
the federal reserve board has been pushing up interest rates in 
an attempt to fight inflation by curbing growth 
if the fed doesnt see the soft landing it desires it may 
force rates still higher precipitating an actual contraction of 
the economy a recession instead of just sluggishness 
so when reed was asked how he could describe a prediction of a 
slowdown as optimistic he replied there is nothing called a 
recession in this forecast 
the area of the economy expected to slow the most according to 
the economic panel is consumer demand and the executives are 
tailoring their plans to that expectation 
smith predicted a rationalization of capacity in the auto 
industry over the next few years meaning outdated plants will be 
closed and perhaps jobs lost 
philip m hawley chairman of carter hawley hale stores inc a 
department store chain said retailers are expecting only 
reasonably moderate growth in holiday sales 
if growth in consumer spending was more vigorous as it was in 
198286 that would have longrange implications for the economy 
that were not good including higher imports at a time when the 
united states is trying to shrink its trade deficit 
in between rounds of golf and sets of tennis at the homestead a 
posh resort in the mountains of western virginia the executives 
met behind closed doors to hear from politicians and experts on two 
subjects education and the federal budget deficit the news was 
not good 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said only 15 to 20 percent of the nations children are 
receiving an adequate education 
yet according to ernest l boyer president of the carnegie 
foundation for the advancement of teaching and a former us 
commissioner of education in the carter administration neither of 
the presidential candidates has put forward a coherent education 
program 
theres been a strange silence he said 
robert s strauss cochairman of a highlevel government 
commission working on a budget deficit reduction plan for the next 
president said he is of reasonably good cheer about the 
prospects of proposing a constructive and worthwhile solution 
but strauss and his fellow cochairman former reagan 
administration transportation secretary drew lewis said their 
recommendation would fail without the support of the next president 
republican candidate george bush has already said he will ignore 
the recommendation if it includes a tax increase democrat michael 
dukakis chief revenueraising proposal is more efficient tax 
collection neither candidate has proposed substantial spending 
cuts 
without support from the white house congress isnt going 
to fall on its sword to please our commission lewis said 
theres got to be a joint effort here

cattle prices are being pushed higher this 
fall by hefty demand and smaller supplies but agriculture 
department analysts say consumers may not see much further effect 
at retail beef counters 
livestock producers are coping with substantially higher feed 
costs as a result of the 1988 drought says the departments 
economic research service feed grain and protein meal prices are 
up and beef and dairy farmers in drought areas will face higher 
winter forage costs 
but the agency added that producers are adjusting gradually 
without major liquidations or drops in production 
cash receipts from livestock sales are expected to rise slightly 
from last years 762 billion but higher feed costs will reduce 
net incomes 
the commercial slaughter of cows from beef and dairy herds 
through the end of august remained at about 7 percent below a year 
earlier indicating that no massive herd liquidations occurred as 
had been feared earlier when the drought worsened 
even so this summers drought likely resulted in some cows 
being slaughtered ahead of the normal culling period because of 
poor forage conditions the agency said in a new issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine an even greater increase could 
occur later this year 
but cow slaughter in the third quarter was expected to be about 
16 million head down 4 percent from july august and september 
1987 thirdquarter increases in cow slaughter are common and this 
years seasonal increase was about average for the last five years 
in the fourth quarter cow slaughter a major source of 
hamburger and other beef for processing also usually increase 
but this time the gain is expected to be far less than the 5year 
average of 18 percent 
the fourthquarter slaughter increase slowed to 10 percent in 
1986 and to 5 percent last year the report said this falls 
increase is also expected to be around 5 percent 
fewer cows going to slaughter as well as seasonally declining 
steer and heifer slaughter in coming months should reduce 
available beef supplies during the remainder of the year the 
report said 
market prices of fed cattle dropped to the mid60s per 100 
pounds by late september from more than 71 earlier in the month as 
more animals went to slaughter 
the relatively strong prices this summer reflected increased 
demand for beef exports and continued strong demand by retail 
hotel restaurant and institutional establishments at a time of 
nearly record retail prices the report said cattle prices 
could move even higher during the fourth quarter as beef production 
declines by up to 10 percent from the summer quarter 
however the report added the rising cattle prices are not 
expected to push retail beef prices much higher because marketing 
margins or the markup between producer and consumer should 
begin to narrow and a larger share of the consumers dollar will be 
returned to producers

the public has almost a month to file comments 
with the agriculture department on a rulechange proposal that 
would allow a wider variety of binders in processed meat and 
poultry 
binders are additives that act as extenders and to hold products 
together for example the proposal would allow such additives in 
chili con carne and a number of other products 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said the agency has received 
requests from a number of companies asking for the rule change 
the petitioners have made a reasonable request considering 
that these binders including wheat gluten tapioca dextrin whey 
protein concentrate and sodium caseinate are generally approved as 
safe for use in food and are already approved for use in many 
products including spaghetti and meatballs and poultry rolls 
but the binders are currently allowed in specific meat and 
poultry products as part of individual product standards he said 
under the proposal the binders would be listed in federal 
regulations under a table of approved substances 
the listing would name the binders the products they can be 
used in the approved purpose and the use levels 
interested persons should submit comments by nov 7 to policy

the soviet union says its 1988 grain harvest 
is almost wrapped up somewhat ahead of last year when heavy rains 
delayed progress says an agriculture department report 
soviet watchers in the departments foreign agricultural service 
said soviet press reports put the harvest at 93 percent complete as 
of sept 26 with threshing of grain done on 1009 million 
hectares a year ago 957 million hectares had been threshed by 
sept 28 
the usda has forecast total soviet grain output this year at 205 
million metric tons down from 2114 million tons in 1987 and 2101 
million tons in 1986 but still one of the largest yields on record 
one hectare is about 247 acres and a metric ton is 
approximately 2205 pounds

when ronald reagan entered the white house in 
1981 the national debt was less than 1 trillion today it has 
soared to 26 trillion and the interest alone is costing 
taxpayers 210 billion more than the nations elderly receive in 
social security benefits 
so what do republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis 
propose to do about the budget deficit 
despite bushs talk of a flexible freeze on most government 
spending and dukakis hopes of reaping tens of billions of dollars 
through vigorous tax collection economists say neither 
presidential candidate has put forward a credible plan for mopping 
up the tidal wave of red ink 
the deficit however has not emerged as a major campaign issue 
despite gloomy prognostications from some economists neither bush 
nor dukakis has felt much pressure to fill in the blanks of his 
deficitreduction promises 
bushs oftrepeated vow is i will not raise your taxes 
period in 1980 he derided reagans promise to balance the 
budget while cutting taxes and raising military spending as 
voodoo economics now the vice president is following in 
reagans footsteps by promising more tax cuts and vowing to keep 
hands off social security 
the vice president has offered a flexible freeze on 
government spending except for social security and interest 
payments on the national debt he would limit the overall growth of 
other government spending to the rate of inflation with increases 
in some areas offset by unspecified cuts elsewhere 
its a commitment to slow the growth of government spending to 
make even better progress in reducing the budget deficit than we 
have been doing and are projected to do said michael j boskin 
a stanford university economics professor and senior bush adviser 
exactly when it would lead to a balanced budget depends on how 
well the economy does 
boskin said the annual deficit which in 1983 was the equivalent 
of 63 percent of the gross national product is down to 32 
percent of gnp and is headed to 18 percent of gnp in 1993 even 
without the flexible freeze according to a congressional budget 
office forecast 
to critics who question how bush will achieve his goal while 
exempting social security boskin says it leaves most of the 
budget he said bush is committed to negotiating spending 
restraints with congress but he doesnt think its appropriate 
that he lay out a detailed fiscal 1990 budget during the 
presidential campaign 
like reagan bush espouses a balanced budget amendment and 
lineitem veto authority dukakis opposes both says bush the 
most important action we need to take on the budget deficit is to 
hold the line on taxing and spending 
dukakis says tax increases would be only a last resort but 
that no serious candidate can rule out the possibility of new 
taxes his first resort he says would be tougher tax 
enforcement 
dukakis knows that fellow democrat walter mondale helped doom 
his 1984 campaign against reagan by declaring that higher taxes 
were inevitable so dukakis talks of raising tens of billions of 
dollars through a onetime tax amnesty and tougher enforcement 
this is not a pieinthesky formula says dukakis who 
estimates that 110 billion in taxes go uncollected each year 
tom herman a senior dukakis campaign adviser said dukakis 
hopes to net 10 billion from tax cheats in the first year and 30 
billion annually by 1993 
there are only four ways to reduce the federal budget deficit 
cut spending increase revenue lower interest rates and improve 
economic performance we must do all four says the democratic 
nominee 
dukakis has called for spending cuts on star wars the 
spacebased missile defense system and some weapons programs he 
promises to make tough choices elsewhere in the budget 
including unspecified savings on agriculture welfare and health 
care 
he also would cut back development of a supersonic space plane 
and pare support for nuclear fission and fusion research he rules 
out social security cuts 
alice rivlin senior fellow at the brookings institution and 
former director of the nonpartisan congressional budget office 
said both candidates have been vague about what they would do about 
the deficit 
neither has put out any kind of a solid plan to bring the 
deficit down she said the reason for that is there really 
isnt a good plan which can avoid an increase in taxes nobody 
wants to dramatize that fact 
lawrence chimerine chairman and chief economist of the wefa 
group said bush would aggravate the deficit with a series of tax 
cuts or credits he has promised from lower taxes on capital gains 
to a 1000 toddler tax credit for poor families 
dukakis might find some savings in military and domestic 
spending and bring in more revenues by bolstering the internal 
revenue service but were talking very small numbers 
chimerine said 
both candidates are counting on lower interest rates to help 
reduce the deficit but that is not necessarily within the 
presidents power to deliver 
its catch22 said chimerine you cant get the drop in 
interest rates until you put forth a credible program but 
fundamentally the drop in interest rates is essentially what their 
program is 
david keating executive vice president of the national 
taxpayers union said bushs flexible freeze could work if he 
could get congress to follow it but every time the vice president 
is in a debate or public forum he seems to come up with another 
spending program 
economist michael evans said both candidates are up a tree 
in their quest for lower interest rates 
interest rates are likely to rise if the deficit rises he 
said the fed federal reserve board is going to have to defend 
the dollar next year and thats going to push the deficit higher 
the fed often raises interest rates to defend the dollar but 
that also would drive up the governments own borrowing costs and 
increase the deficit 
rivlin said the flexible freeze idea sounds good but when you 
look at it it means medicare and medicaid would have to be cut 
substantially or youd have to cut a lot of other spending 
while bush has said cutting the capital gains tax rate will 
generate revenues the congressional budget office has estimated it 
will result in lost revenues of 39 billion a year some estimates 
are even higher 
democrats on capitol hill say bushs other proposals such as 
child care tax credits and taxdeferred savings accounts for 
middleincome families would cost several billion dollars in 
revenues 
bush and dukakis have another excuse for staying mum on deficit 
reduction a bipartisan national economic commission is to report 
early next year on ways to do the job 
both candidates disavowed a recent statement by the commissions 
cochairman robert strauss that the only way to solve the deficit 
problem is to go after social security and other entitlements 
the commission could help the country end its deficitspending 
binge of the 1980s rivlin said but only if the new president 
wants it to if the president wants it hell have lots of help

as election day nears education remains at 
best a marginal issue in the 1988 campaign the stuff of political 
rhetoric and modest promises but not a cuttingedge issue for 
either candidate 
more attention has been paid to whether teachers should be 
compelled to lead the pledge of allegiance at the start of each 
school day than to what students learn after that patriotic ritual 
george bush has said repeatedly he wants to go down in history 
as the education president the republican candidate tells 
voters wherever he goes that better schools are the key to a better 
future for america 
michael dukakis too asserts that he wants to be the 
education president the democrat gets big cheers every time he 
promises were going to make teaching a valued and honored 
profession again 
whichever candidate wins on nov 8 educators are confident the 
education budget will be in safer hands under the next president 
than under ronald reagan 
but they say neither bush who attended private schools as a 
youngster nor dukakis who attended public schools has done 
enough to dramatize the problems facing american schools or to 
spell out a convincing plan to improve performance 
ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said we hear strong inspirational 
statements about how important education is but the direction the 
education president would take is still not clear 
at the outset of the campaign the candidates were stumbling 
all over themselves to say this was americas most urgent 
obligation said boyer it faded as a central issue 
richard berendzen president of the american university in 
washington said i grade both on what i hear and what i dont 
hear id give both a dplus 
berendzen said 25 percent of american young people drop out of 
high school and 20 percent grow up in poverty and the united 
states is far back on international scholastic tests 
if you take a sober look at the matter you could say that the 
preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year 
2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing america said 
berendzen 
despite the generalities said college board president donald m 
stewart it is obvious both candidates are making the link 
between economic productivity and international competitiveness and 
the underserved undereducated poor 
however dennis doyle a hudson institute scholar said it is 
inevitable that education will slip to the back of the presidents 
agenda 
education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will 
actually keep as apart from a campaignlist said doyle the 
deficit defense international relations economic problems even 
health care social security transportation and housing all are 
higher on their priority list 
both candidates have outlined ways to help families cope with 
the soaring costs of college bush with a taxfree savings bond 
plan and dukakis with a new loan program that students would repay 
through payroll deductions 
bush whose administration tried to cut 5 billion from the 
education department last year now is proposing bigger spending 
increases than his rival 
here are their major education proposals

500 million for a merit schools program that would reward 
schools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students 
schools would get up to 100000 each to spend as they saw fit 
50 million for matching grants to create more magnet 
schools that emphasize various academic subjects 
expanding from 12 million to 50 million a proposed fund for 
innovation and reform of schools and teaching to give each state 1 
million for an experimental district trying such concepts as 
parental choice merit pay or yearround schools 
money for head start the 12 billion preschool program for 
disadvantaged children would be sharply increased by an 
unspecified amount bush said he is committed to building head 
start to a level where all eligible 4yearolds can attend 
classes the childrens defense fund says the 453000 children 
now in head start are only 16 percent of those eligible 
bush has also promised to spend more on chapter 1 a 46 
billion remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible 
poor students 
taxfree us savings bonds for college tuition this would 
eventually cost the treasury 200 million a year the tax break 
would be phased out for families earning 60000 to 80000 or 
above

program for talented teachers 
25 million for a citizens literacy corps to support 
volunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read 
a student tuition and repayment system stars allowing 
students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions in 
their working years it would supplement not replace existing 
federal grants and loans at least at the start students would get 
stars loans from banks 
dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of oneeighth to 
onequarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per 1000 borrowed 
meaning a tax of 25 to 5 percent for a 20000 borrower 
the rate stays the same for low and highincome earners but 
the loan is never paid off

the other day darleen reilly picked up the 
phone and called a local radio station to play a game it calls 
name that sound she correctly identified a rack being rolled 
into the dishwasher and came away 4000 richer 
then the disc jockeys turned to politics 
one of them described the irony of lloyd bentsen and dan quayle 
these two millionaires he said derisively sharing a stage 
in omaha to discuss all the good things they would do for the 
common man 
it was a cynical moment but the presidential campaigns have 
invited this sort of contempt from the moment the conventions 
ended in august its been a dispiriting race it began trivial 
quickly turned negative and now its gotten worse 
george bush generally gets the blame for touching off the 
trivia budget deficits are enormous a drug epidemic has hit 
practically every strata of society superpower relations at a 
turning point farmers coming off another tough year nine 
americans remain hostage in lebanon 
with all this facing the next president bush has been 
bludgeoning dukakis over the pledge of allegiance and a 
massachusetts prison furlough program he initiated a madefortv 
battle of cop endorsements and summoned reporters to boston harbor 
to ridicule dukakis over its filth while refusing to answer 
questions about administration environmental vetoes 
it got so bad that richard nixon of all people described 
campaign 88 as trivial superficial and inane nixon said bush 
and dukakis have found that the surest way they could make the 
evening news was to be silly or irresponsible or both 
barry goldwater summoned for an arizona campaign appearance 
startled quayle by telling his fellow republican i hope youll 
take this kindly but i want you to go back and tell george bush to 
start talking about the issues 
dont hold your breath trivializing is working for bush hes 
come from behind to enjoy a comfy lead in the polls and he 
continues to put dukakis on the defensive on these gut issues 
dukakis finally answered on saturday after a week of bush abuse on 
crime policy 
behind in the polls the dukakis people figured they better 
answer in kind they saw that voters seemed to respond to the 
negative campaign and though it would be nice to get off the 
defensive for a change 
dukakis had been delivering some issueoriented speeches on 
defense health insurance college education but now the high road 
would take a back seat to a new series of starkly negative campaign 
ads 
no sooner did the millionaires debate end then dukakis hit the 
air with some antiquayle commercials 
a spot called oval office features scenes of harry truman 
lyndon johnson and gerald ford taking their presidential oaths as a 
narrator says one in five vice presidents has had to rise to the 
presidency 
for this job after five months of reflection george bush 
made his personal choice j danforth quayle the ad says 
hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that 
really was 
the bush campaign meanwhile is airing tough ads criticizing 
dukakis prison furlough program tax hikes and other aspects of 
his record as massachusetts governor spending about 4 million 
last week alone 
the victim of one furloughed inmate flew to california last week 
to cut some radio ads for bush what the ads wont say is that 
president reagan as governor of california supported furloughs 
even after two convicts killed people while on furlough in the 
early 1970s and reagan raised taxes when he had too just as he 
did as president 
one of these days maybe tomorrow the campaign may focus for 
a minute on something like strategic doctrine or central american 
policy or a real war not a phony war on drugs but unless there 
is a sudden sea change in the tenor of campaign 88 millions of 
registered voters are going to wake up on nov 8 scratching their 
heads and asking where do these guys stand 
what are the issues so far wonders a perplexed new york 
gov mario cuomo pledge of allegiance furloughs death penalty 
are you kidding

if the presidential race were to go to the 
candidate with the fastest plane republican george bush would 
leave democrat michael dukakis in his jetstream 
one only need to hear the nickname of the dukakis plane sky 
pig to get the general idea 
the name comes partly from the bloated look of the aircraft a 
stubby 20yearold boeing 737 but mostly the description is based 
on flying time it takes the plane seven hours to cross the country 
a 4hour flight on most commercial airlines 
method of travel is just one of many contrasts of daytoday 
life on the campaign trail for the two men who would be president 
because hes the vice president bush gets to draw from a fleet 
of fast air force planes hangared at andrews air force base near 
washington 
as any plane the president flies automatically becomes air 
force one whatever plane bush is on becomes air force two 
usually a converted boeing 707 or a mcdonnelldouglas dc9 bushs 
planes are fast meticulously cared for and flown by air force 
pilots 
bushs campaign reimburses taxpayers in part for the use of 
the plane which is blue and white with the words the united 
states of america emblazoned across the sides 
dukakis plane chartered from presidential airlines is the 
same aircraft that bushs former rival kansas sen bob dole used 
designed for shortrange flying sky pig cannot cross the 
country without one or more refueling stops 
that was fine for the kind of campaigning dole did during the 
gop primaries after all dole used to joke that hed fly over a 
state and direct the pilot to land wherever he spotted a crowd 
but it poses some scheduling problems in the final weeks of a 
national campaign 
aides to dukakis however say the candidate is comfortable with 
the plane likes the presidential designation on the side in 
green letters and has no plans to trade it in for a sleeker model 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one reason dukakis may like the plane is food 
he has been known to eat with delight meals that aides and 
reporters flying with him have pronounced indigestible the airline 
also stocks plenty of raisin bran and milk the massachusetts 
governors favorite breakfast 
bush by comparison smothers nearly everything he eats on the 
plane ranging from pork rinds and taco salads to tuna fish 
sandwiches with hot red pepper sauce but then the usual 
offering on air force two is bland military fare served by 
government employees 
when possible bush treats plane meals as snacks or skips them 
altogether saving most of his appetite for large meals in 
restaurants 
bush usually hits a restaurant unannounced then mingles with 
the other patrons for some impromptu campaigning dukakis by 
contrast seldom eats in restaurants while on the campaign trail 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both candidates travel with an entourage of aides secret 
service agents and reporters 
but air force two has room for only a small pool of six to 
nine representatives of the news media the rest of the traveling 
press corps is put on one and sometimes two press planes 
dukakis plane has more seats for members of the news media 
about 30 but there is also a backup plane for camera crews and 
reporters unable to get seats on sky pig 
for a reporter the main advantage of riding on dukakis backup 
plane a boeing 727 is that it always gets there first the main 
advantage of riding on bushs press plane the food is better 
bush frequently comes back and chats with the small group of 
reporters on his plane sometimes inviting them up to his cabin for 
drinks and informal chitchat 
by contrast dukakis seldom speaks to the reporters or secret 
service agents who travel with him 
however dukakis aides are generally more plentiful and more 
talkative 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
security for both candidates is tight but bushs motorcades are 
longer in addition to two bulletproof black limousines both 
flown in on cargo planes in advance bushs motorcades routinely

a rusting cylinder of poison has been 
destroyed and the 3500 residents who were cleared out are home 
but officials say more evacuations can be expected if new hazards 
are found at an abandoned chemical plant 
residents within 1000 yards of the plant were told to leave 
their homes sunday while the us environmental protection agency 
blew up a tank of what it thought was hydrogen cyanide 
as little as 50 milligrams of the chemical or less than 
onesixth the weight of the average aspirin tablet can kill 
the evacuations took two hours 2 hours less than expected 
there is a possibility almost a certainty that there will be 
future evacuations here said epa spokesman harold yates 
more than 3400 drums and barrels most unidentified rusting 
or both were left behind in this kanawha river town of 9000 when 
artel chemical co couldnt pay its workers and a federal judge 
ordered the site closed in june 
with the hydrogen cyanide cylinder blown up the most pressing 
problems now are a 9000gallon tank of methyl mercaptan which is 
toxic and highly flammable and a bunker full of sodium which 
reacts violently upon contact with water 
there could be surprises too as the cleanup continues at the 
superfund site yates said 
we have found a number of incompatible materials stored in 
close proximity yates said its a threat to public health 
sundays explosion occurred at 155 pm and a fire was started 
to burn off the tanks contents none of the gas was detected 
downwind but a cyanide monitor held directly over the burning 
cylinder read 1 part per million said jerry heston the epas 
onsite coordinator 
there was no reason to think it was anything other than 
hydrogen cyanide heston said but added that more tests will be 
done to find out 
the epa took over the plant and closed it after the federal 
government declared it a threat to public health yates said the 
cleanup could take years and mayor don karnes said future 
cooperation could be limited 
ill tell people they should leave if they the epa tell me 
to but im not sure theyre going to go karnes said they 
made all this fuss about this and then it turned out to be almost 
nothing 
elmer fike who for 33 years operated fike chemical co now 
artel chemical co said venting the poison to the atmosphere over 
a 24 to 36hour period would have eliminated the need to disrupt 
so many people 
ive told them other ways to taking care of this fike said 
before the explosion theyre blowing this way out of 
proportion 
but heson said the epa believed a controlled explosion of the 
tank and its contents was the best solution 
im not going to open the valve and see what it is he said 
the evacuation was scheduled to last from 1220 pm to 5 pm 
but the detonation went so smoothly that the all clear signal was 
given 2 hours early nearly everyone who was asked to leave did 
heading to nearby shopping malls or to relatives homes rather than 
the official evacuation center where only 26 people went 
the federal government built the town of nitro in world war i to 
manufacture explosives and munitions there are now more than two 
dozen chemical plants in a 12mile stretch along the river thats 
known as chemical valley

the sovietstyle government is 
changing its tactics against moslem guerrillas in the battle for 
power as moscows army withdraws 
the government dominated by a communist party that has been 
trying to portray itself as the real defender of the moslem faith 
is campaigning for international pressure to halt american and 
pakistani support for the guerrillas 
both the soviet union and the afghan government have been 
maneuvering for a negotiated settlement rather than a military 
showdown although moscow continues to arm the kabul government 
the guerrillas have also achieved some changes such as the 
ability to move weapons faster from pakistan to the hills outside 
kabul but they still lack the coordination for a significant new 
strategy 
however some western diplomats believe the fierce afghan winter 
poses less of an obstacle to the guerrillas ability to mount 
attacks on kabul than in the past 
the withdrawal of about 50000 soviet soldiers this summer gave 
the guerrillas greater control of roads and highways especially 
those leading from their supply bases in pakistan to kabul this 
means they are no longer restricted to taking circuitous routes 
through mountains where winter snows often block the passes 
the remaining soviet soldiers estimated at 50000 to 55000 
are to withdraw by feb 15 under an accord signed in geneva last 
april 
the rebels supply situation has improved vastly a western 
diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity a few years 
ago they depended on camels donkeys and horses now theyre 
depending on mercedesbenz trucks 
but the real test will be whether the rebels can mount a serious 
enough siege of kabul to curtail the citys fuel and food supplies 
this winter 
already sugar has virtually disappeared from the markets in 
kabul in the last week after key highways leading to the capital 
were closed by the guerrillas 
residents also report a shortage of flour for bread an afghan 
staple and say the prices of basic foodstuffs have risen by 20 
percent or more in the last two months 
the april 14 geneva agreement that provided for the soviet 
withdrawal was signed by the united states the soviet union 
pakistan and afghanistan 
both afghanistan and the soviet union have increasingly targeted 
pakistan as a violator of the accord in an effort to pressure 
pakistan to force the guerrillas to negotiate in addition the 
death of pakistans president mohammed zia ulhaq in august 
deprived the guerrillas of their most ardent suppporter 
so far the rebels dont appear willing to negotiate 
foreign diplomats estimate the soviets now have 35000 men 
defending kabul and an additional 20000 or more deployed outside 
the capital 
washington has predicted the afghan government and its armed 
forces will collapse after the soviets complete their withdrawal 
the morale of the 40000man afghan army is considered low but 
the army is not the backbone of the governments military strength 
its real clout as one wellregarded western analyst pointed 
out rests with three other forces that have a total of at least 
100000 men who are highly motivated and equipped with heavy armor 
field guns and aircraft these are the sarandoy a paramilitary 
force of 25000 the 15000man secret police force known by the 
afghan acronym of khad and 60000 to 70000 tribal militiamen paid 
by kabul 
the rebels strength has been variously estimated at between 
40000 and 200000 but there is no clear indication how many are 
fulltime fighters or even inside afghanistan instead of across the 
border in pakistan 
more important the analyst said is that the biggest band of 
guerrillas in any location numbers no more than 100 men and local 
commanders have little contact with each other 
the rank and file of afghanistans regular army is generally 
regarded as little more than cannon fodder foreign diplomats and 
afghans said vacancies caused by desertions and casualties are 
filled by forced conscription of draftees as young as 14 and by 
giving amnesty to political prisoners and then drafting them 
as part of the governments attempt at changing its image this 
spring it started allowing the international committee of the red 
cross to visit political prisoners and has announced the release of 
4000 such prisoners so far this year 
the belief is that half of them have gone straight into the 
army theyre given one day of training and then theyre put 
into the front line the western analyst said 
he and other diplomats said boys of 14 and 16 continue to be 
rounded up for army duty

prime minister yitzhak shamir drew cheers 
in this working class town by vowing to use more force to quell the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories if he is 
reelected next month 
the 72yearold leader also said sunday he would never agree to 
an independent palestinian state which plo leaders may declare at 
a meeting planned later this month in tunisia shamir said he would 
seek other ways of reaching peace with arab neighbors 
he told the associated press he would propose peace talks with 
arabs on the basis of an autonomy plan outlined in a 1979 peace 
treaty with egypt asked why he would pursue the idea despite its 
rejection by palestinians shamir replied whoever wants to 
propose something the arabs will accept has to say goodbye to the 
state of israel 
i will initiate and attempt to persuade arab states to 
negotiate by this plan shamir said if they say no outright 
i wont be deterred 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc spoke after being 
flown by army helicopter to israels negev desert where he 
campaigned for five hours in three towns including dimona 50 
miles south of jerusalem 
dimona like many other immigrant towns in israel is a likud 
stronghold whose residents are mostly of sephardi origin sephardi 
israelis make up a large percentage of the nations disadvantaged 
and have long enjoyed more political influence in likud than in the 
leftleaning labor party 
dozens of children waving plastic israeli flags surrounded 
shamir as he arrived in dimona a local official invited him home 
for a light dinner of fried sole eggs and cheese 
later at an election rally in a shopping center shamir 
enthralled some 3000 supporters with calls for tough treatment of 
arab violence 
waving a fist in the air shamir unleashed attacks on labor 
party leader and foreign minister shimon peres his main rival in 
the nov 1 parliamentary elections shamir warned that peres 
conciliatory approach to the arabs is liable to bring us the 
greatest tragedy 
if likud wins the arabs will understand there is no more 
hope for an international conference or a palestinian state 
shamir said theyll see they have to hold dialogue with the 
likud and that we are ready for negotiations without 
preconditions 
peres has backed an arabsupported plan for a conference of 
western countries including the us and soviet union who would 
mediate a settlement of the arabisraeli conflict shamir opposes 
the plan claiming such a wide forum of nations would put 
inordinate pressure on israel to concede lands captured in the 1967 
middle east war 
whoever withdraws from judea samaria biblical names for the 
west bank and gaza opens the door to a palestinian state 
shamir warned 
a palestinian state he said would be a trap every country 
would come to its aid america the soviet union europe there 
would be war forever 
shamir also promised to crush the uprising that has claimed the 
lives of more than 290 palestinians and six israelis since dec 8 
we will use all the means at our disposal so that the arabs 
will see there is not much point to their war shamir added 
privately in remarks to reporters 
the premier also warned supporters against disrupting labor 
party rallies after two likud fans nearly broke up three labor 
rallies this week heckling peres and calling him a traitor in one 
town likud backers sprayed water from hoses at labor ralliers on 
saturday 
labor reportedly planned to protest the violence to the central 
elections committee today 
the election campaign has grown tense largely over charged 
emotions generated by the unrest in the disputed territories and 
because public opinion polls show both large parties at a virtual 
deadlock 
dont vent your anger so freely shamir cautioned we must 
control ourselves exercise selfrestraint keep our anger in our 
hearts and express it only at the ballot box

home secretary douglas hurd says britain needs to 
change the law that gives suspects a legal right to remain silent 
at present if they stay silent under police questioning this 
cannot be held to weigh against them at their trial 
no one can take out the thumbscrews and force reluctant people 
to speak hurd said in an filmed interview for the british 
broadcasting corp program panorama 
the question is to what extent can a court take into account 
the fact that someone has been dumb has not spoken or has spun a 
yarn at the last minute which didnt emerge at the police 
station 
in the end he said we will need im quite sure in england 
and wales to change the law on the right to silence 
the interview was filmed in advance for broadcast tonight but 
made available to journalists before screening 
cabinet member hurds home office is the government department 
responsible for police and law and order among other matters 
scotland has its own legal system 
a year ago the head of scotland yard metropolitan police 
commissioner peter imbert said a suspects legal right to remain 
silent in police custody without this weighing against him or her 
at the trial hampered the fight against crime and should be removed 
both the judge and prosecution should be able to draw a jurys 
attention to a suspects refusal to answer questions imbert told 
an internatinal police conference in london 
its a puzzle to me how a privilege against selfincrimination 
ever gained a respectable place in the english legal system if we 
are to deter people from criminal acts then increasing the 
prospects of conviction for them would be a most significant 
step imbert said 
civil liberties organizations and some lawyers groups have 
protested that removing the right to silence would cause a 
fundamental change in the law to the detriment of defendants 
at present the socalled burden of proof at a trial is on the 
prosecution it must show conclusively that an accused person is 
guilty before he or she can be convicted critics say that if the 
right to silence is removed the burden of proof will be shifted to 
the defense to show that an accused person is innocent

is widespread among young people but that nearly half said tuition 
costs block many from college

tuition costs of a college the better the quality of education a 
student will receive

percent of 1315 yearolds felt that way 41 percent of 16 and 
17yearolds surveyed agreed but among current college students 
and recent graduates 27 percent agreed 
college officials have lately dubbed that belief the chivas 
regal syndrome after the premium scotch whisky as an 
explanation for why ivy league and other expensive colleges 
continue to attract so many applicants students and parents seem 
ready to pay almost any price for what they believe is a quality 
education

support of education and conducted aug 24 to sept 7 by the gallup 
organization it was based on telephone interviews of persons ages 
1321 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points

not go to college 48 percent said they thought the reason was that 
college is too expensive and they cant afford it 
fiftynine percent of high school juniors and seniors polled

wanted 37 percent said theyd try to get loans 32 percent would 
look for parttime jobs 14 percent said they would select another 
college and 2 percent said they would not attend college the rest 
werent sure 
other findings 
54 percent of americas high school juniors and seniors said

particular courses and curriculum was extremely important 44 
percent cited the schools academic reputation 45 percent said 
college expenses were a crucial factor 
only 20 percent cited social life or athletic reputation as 
extremely important

to free american war prisoners 
us officials in bangkok said the laotian government has 
informed the us embassy in vientiane that it had arrested donna

intended to pass out dollar bills stamped with an offer of 24 
million to any laotian vietnamese or cambodian who could produce a 
live american being held in indochina

while antiabortion activists assaulted 
clinics during last weeks siege of atlanta a lowerkey though 
no less intense battle raged in michigan over a ballot measure 
aimed at outlawing taxfinanced abortions for the poor 
the referendum in michigan one of three states with 
abortionrelated questions on novembers ballot is being closely 
watched because so much money is being spent more than 3 million 
budgeted by both sides 
abortion foes here have passed out lifesavers candies in hopes 
of mobilizing the likeminded without offending anyone else 
the prochoice side is considered the underdog outfinanced and 
outorganized by the antiabortion forces 
michigan is certainly the bellwether state theres no 
question about it said dr john willke president of national 
right to life but im not going to predict any of this i dont 
know whos going to win 
in arkansas where officials say no state funds are used to pay 
for abortions voters nonetheless are being asked to enshrine the 
noabortion spending policy in the state constitution and to 
declare the policy of the state of arkansas is to protect the 
life of every unborn child from conception until birth 
jerry cox executive director of the unborn child amendment 
committee said a victory at the polls would put arkansas in 
position to outlaw all abortions if the us supreme court ever 
modifies roe vs wade the landmark 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
in colorado prochoice forces are trying to repeal a 
constitutional amendment similar to arkansas since 1984 medicaid 
abortion spending has been prohibited except in extreme situations 
campaign officials estimate total spending on the ballot 
question could reach 1 million 
the current prohibition against public funding is extreme 
its unfair and its expensive said ed zorensky of colorado 
taxpayers for choice 
according to the state office of budget and planning it would 
cost four times as much in welfare costs to force unwilling women 
to bear unwanted children and support them on welfare than to 
provide public funding for abortion 
prochoice activists there believe they lost the 1984 campaign 
because the ballot wording confused voters 
colorado is a very strong prochoice state if we get the 
message out i think well win zorensky said 
the campaign is hottest in michigan where attention has 
centered on the impact of the committee to end taxfunded 
abortions not with my money you dont advertisements 
i worry about the tremendous amount of resources the other 
side is putting into misleading media said debra ness who 
tracks the state ballot campaigns for the national abortion rights 
action league unless we have the resources to counter those 
messages its not a fair test of the question of choice 
the message from the committee to end taxfunded abortions 
deliberately is not about choice 
its commercials put together by the agency handling george 
bushs presidential campaign advertising feature welldressed 
people talking in a nice restaurant about how theyre going to vote 
the ads make a distinction between the issue of abortion and the 
issue on the ballot 
the way that its framed is very very clever ness said 
money buys sophistication the antis are trying to make their 
stand in michigan 
the state league of women voters which wont choose sides 
between political candidates is working with the prochoice 
coalition and has lambasted the antiabortion campaign claiming it 
is disguising its longterm goals behind the ads 
the peoples campaign for choice a coalition of womens 
religious and labor groups thats fighting to defeat michigans 
proposal a says 6 million a year in welfare abortion spending is 
not the only thing at stake in the campaign 
the group contends that if voters strip the poor of the right to 
a statepaid abortion it will give momentum to those seeking to 
end all abortions 
in atlanta more than 450 people were arrested last week in four 
days of protests dubbed the siege of atlanta by operation 
rescue the new yorkbased antiabortion group that staged the 
demonstrations

president augusto pinochet acknowledged 
defeat in a referendum on extending his rule but again rejected 
opposition demands for his resignation and vowed to stay in power 
for another 18 months 
a key opposition leader meanwhile was quoted sunday as calling 
for talks with the military government on the nations political 
future 
in a surprise television appearance from his country home at 
bucalemu gen pinochet said sunday i acknowledge the 
oppositions victory but i am not going to change what the 
constitution says march 11 1990 is going to be the day that the 
government is handed over 
the situation is very simple he said we fulfilled the 
constitution that was set up so now that the opposition has 
triumphed why should we change 
the comments of the 72yearold commanderinchief of chiles 
armed forces came during a threeminute tv newscast pinochet was 
dressed in a shortsleeve blue shirt he appeared relaxed and spoke 
clearly and firmly 
nearly 7 million chileans went to the polls wednesday to vote on 
the armed forces proposal that pinochet remain president until 
1997 pinochet who ousted elected marxist president salvador 
allende in a 1973 coup that left allende dead lost by about 
800000 votes or a margin of more than 11 percent 
the vote was carried out under a 1980 constitution that 
document also calls for elections for president and congress to be 
held in december 1989 with the winners taking office in march 
opposition leaders have pressed pinochets military government 
to move up the date of elections and make other constitutional 
changes 
their proposals include eliminating a constitutional ban on 
marxist groups and allowing the entire senate not just 
twothirds to be elected rather than appointed 
opposition leaders also want to streamline the process by which 
future constitutional changes can be made 
we will formally call on those holding power now to talk to 
reach an agreement opposition spokesman patricio aylwin said in 
an interview published sunday in the newspaper la epoca we will 
take the initiative by making a proposal and call to the armed 
forces 
aylwin is spokesman for the 16party coalition that urged 
chileans to vote no in the referendum 
a 4man military junta acts as the legislature of this south 
america country which has been ruled by freely elected democratic 
governments for most of its 178year history as an independent 
nation 
the junta is empowered to change the constitution but pinochet 
said in a speech broadcast nationwide the night after the 
referendum that he had no intention of doing so 
ricardo lagos a prominent moderate socialist acknowleged that 
negotiations if they take place would take time the people are 
mature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship dont end 
in 15 hours 
but other pinochet opponents already have served notice they 
dont intend to wait long or peacefully on saturday a coalition 
of leftist parties publicly called for pinochets immediate 
resignation 
the situation sets up potential clashes between the government 
and its opponents in the two days following the election tens of 
thousands of chileans celebrated pinochets defeat with spontaneous 
demonstrations in the streets of the capital and other major cities 
on friday an estimated 350000 chileans gathered in a downtown 
park in a rally organized by the opposition 
hundreds of youths have clashed with riot police since the 
referendum leading to two shooting deaths as well as dozens of 
injuries and arrests 
about 20 reporters and photographers suffered minor injuries 
last week when they were attacked by riot police as they covered 
opposition celebrations 
on sunday two national policemen guarding the us consulate 
fired on two unidentified gunmen who shot at them from a parked 
car the state orbe news agency said no injuries were reported

yoko ono and her son will spend most of the next 
few years in europe partly out of fear that a recent unauthorized 
biography of her slain husband could set off a violent reaction 
the new york post reported today 
her husbands assassin mark david chapman said he had decided 
to kill john lennon in 1980 after reading an article about the 
former beatle in a magazine ono said 
the esquire magazine article in 1980 was a nasty one she 
said before leaving for switzerland we laughed it off at the 
time but 45 days later john was killed 
some people such as chapman took it seriously and he said 
in public that it actually made him do it she said 
ono said she does not think the lives of john lennon by 
albert goldman should be taken seriously at all and called the 
book a vicious inaccurate character assassination but she 
added some people might 
ono said her wish to spend more time in europe also stems from 
wanting her son sean lennon to go to school overseas sean 13 
attends a boarding school in switzerland 
i certainly have no reason to want to move out of new york 
she told the post but because sean is in switzerland for a few 
years it opened up the opportunity for me to travel 
ono said her home remains in new york and that she and sean will 
return here often

one of the worlds earliest 
feature films a french production that was thought lost forever 
has turned up intact in new zealand a news report said today 
new zealand press association said an 1896 production by french 
film maker georges melies rescued and restored by the new zealand 
film archive has been identified as the earliest of almost 100 
missing melies films 
jonathan dennis director of the film archive said the 
discovery of le manoir du diable was a major event in world 
film archaeology 
he said the archives search for rare new zealand films 
constantly turned up prints of foreign films that in many cases 
were the only surviving copies of these films 
last year we sent back to the united states 39 crates of rare 
films about 250000 feet in all representing films made there 
between 1898 and 1948 and most of it pre1910 
all of this was film that did not exist elsewhere and was 
thought to have been lost forever he said melies was the 
first great master of the cinema he demonstrated the art and 
potential of the cinema with some classic fantasies and cinema 
magic at a time when other filmmakers were merely recording trains 
arriving at a station 
he said the print of le manoir du diable was worn but intact 
and that a restored copy of the film was taken to paris and shown 
to madeleine mathetemelies the film makers granddaughter 
she identified it and identified her grandfather in the 
film dennis said

a former top city officials indictment for 
allegedly patronizing a bordello with girls as young as age 14 
pulled the covers from liaisons between wealthy powerful men and 
young drugtaking runaways 
roger boas a 67yearold car dealer prominent in local politics 
for nearly 30 years was one of 14 people indicted a week ago today 
he is accused of visiting the bordello during a 2year period 
that included part of his decadelong tenure as the citys chief 
administrative officer and his unsuccessful mayoral campaign 
the bordello in a nondescript twostory building in a mixed 
residentialcommercial neighborhood housed part of a prostitution 
ring that served customers in three states and earned 20000 a 
week authorities said 
the grand jury indictment issued after a 16month 
investigation contains 86 criminal counts against defendants 
including a city police officer and a locally prominent jeweler 
eight of those charged were alleged patrons of the flourishing 
sexforpay operation the others were charged with various counts 
of pimping and pandering 
authorities reportedly learned of the ring in may 1987 through 
an anonymous tip when authorities failed to follow up the tipster 
tried again two months later accusing police of failing to 
investigate because officers were among the patrons 
vice officers put the building under surveillance in september 
five months later the operation was shut down 
although up to eight officers were under investigation by the 
prosecutors office police officials have consistently denied 
allegations that policemen were protecting the operation 
a grand jury began hearing evidence in the case in june 
including testimony from several girls who worked at the bordello 
said john carbone jr assistant district attorney in charge of 
special prosecutions 
some defense attorneys complain their clients are being 
victimized by an investigation targeted to get boas 
district attorney arlo smith denied that 
i dont care whos involved said smith if we dont 
prosecute the case i think it would be a scandal for the city 
just because youve been a prominent candidate doesnt give you 
immunity from your own behavior 
boas who has been married 30 years has four children and won 
the silver and bronze stars in world war ii has been identified by 
five underage prostitutes as the regular client they knew as 
george authorities said he faces 19 counts of unlawful sex 
with a minor stemming from visits between november 1985 and last 
may 
boas released on 5000 bail last week after surrendering said 
he would address the charges in the proper manner but added 
for my familys sake and for the sake of the many friends i 
have in san francisco i am truly saddened that someone in the 
criminal justice system tried to convict me in the media using 
leaks rumors and innuendo in advance of the legal process 
after the indictments came out the san francisco chronicle 
published a lengthy profile of darlene a 15yearold former 
prostitute who said she earned 600 a day at the bordello she 
reportedly became a key witness in the investigation 
a child victim of sexual abuse the girl said she used to act 
young and innocent and would sometimes dress up as a schoolgirl to 
please customers who according to authorities were from san 
francisco los angeles idaho and washington state 
the girl said she and other young prostitutes would sit around 
watching soap operas between appointments stirring cocaine into 
their coffee and smoking marijuana customers were offered a mint 
as they left she said 
smith dismissed as absurd speculation his office leaked 
information before the indictments were announced 
patrick j roberts 40 accused of owning the bordello faces 
more than two dozen criminal counts including felony charges of 
pimping pandering and forcible rape of a 14yearold he is in 
custody on 500000 bail 
roberts recruited girls by cruising polk street in a white 
rollsroyce authorities said 
polk street one of the citys bestknown sexforhire 
districts is noted for the young prostitutes many of them 
homeless runaways who line its sidewalks at all hours

the nations tourism industry stands to 
lose more than 100 million without emergency repairs to the damage 
hurricane gilbert did to the islands reputation as a tourist 
mecca officials said 
they expressed their worries last weekend after prime minister 
edward seaga announced friday that his government is preparing a 
huge advertising campaign to convince foreign tourists that jamaica 
is ready to welcome them again 
government officials acknowledge that the storm the most 
intense on record devastated much of this caribbean island nation 
when it barreled through on sept 12 they say tons of food 
medicine and other supplies are pouring in but much more is needed 
to feed and shelter tens of thousands left homeless by the storm 
the aid is reaching the people the problem is the magnitude 
of their need said an official close to seaga its like an 
endless pit the suffering of the people is greater than the amount 
of aid available 
but damage to jamaicas tourist areas was limited officials 
said 
peter rousseau president of the jamaica hotel and tourist 
association said the country suffered more damage to its 
reputation as a tourist haven than it did to its facilities 
its only about seven properties that have been damaged he 
said what has been hurt is the perception of jamaica 
he said the island must counter its new reputation as a disaster 
area turn the overall tourist trade back on and attract as much of 
the vital us midwest market as possible 
association members have prepared their own advertising blitzes 
and promotions abroad 
hugh hart minister of mining energy and tourism said gilbert 
wreaked havoc over the island and parts of the economy were badly 
damaged but he said some industries including tourism suffered 
only slight damage 
the tourist industry sustained about 45 million damage to hotel 
roofs and windows but 85 percent of hotels are back in operation 
the jamaica tourism board reported it said business could return 
to normal by the end of the month 
however tourism officials said the industry could lose up to 
130 million without quick action 
right after gilbert we had more cancellations than we wanted 
and not as many bookings hart said now its started to level 
off and things seem to be going the other way 
jamaica earned 600 million from stopover visitors in 1987 and 
it was expected to earn about the same this year however gilbert 
forced a reduction in the target figure of 170000 visitors for the 
last four months of 1988 
seaga told parliament that gilbert caused 818 million to 1 
billion damage in jamaica far less than the 8 billion he 
estimated earlier the latest government damage report said the 
storm killed 45 people severely damaged or destroyed half the 
countrys homes and caused 200 million in damage to banana 
coconut coffee and other crops 
a team from toronto is heading to jamaica this week to check 
reports that vast amounts of aid supplies are not getting to the 
people who need them 
paul kafele executive director of the jamaican canadian 
association which is sending the team said his group has heard 
rumors that supplies arent reaching their rightful 
destinations 
because things are so chaotic a dogeatdog mentality has set 
in he said 
meanwhile col franklin thompson director of the kingston 
chapter of the salvation army said 300000 pounds of food and 
medical supplies donated by new yorks west indian population was 
stranded at kennedy international airport for lack of 
transportation

police superintendent joseph a walsh 
was the law in this tough town but after nearly half a century 
with the department hes called it quits to his legendary battles 
with crooks and lawmen 
walsh who retired thursday fended off attempts by several 
mayors and police boards to wrest away control of the police 
department during his 27 years at the helm and he walked away 
unscathed from efforts to link him to organized crime and bribery 
some enemies regarded the man known as the boss jaws 
and the super as the citys own j edgar hoover claiming he 
kept files on power brokers to insure he maintained his grip on the 
department but colleagues on the force like lt roger falcone 
head of special services considered him a cops cop 
joe walshs greatest attribute was that he was a human 
being said attorney joseph mirsky a close friend you either 
loved him or hated him there was no in between 
walsh a bridgeport native who joined the force in 1941 as a 
30aweek patrolman and continued to go out on drug raids in his 
final years dismissed his critics and defended his tenacious grip 
on the department in an interview 
i was a rough cop he said i fought with everybody i 
always thought a police department should be run by a policeman 
he also defended bridgeport an aging industrial city that is 
the states largest and said its reputation as a center for crime 
and drugs is undeserved 
thats a hysteria all over the country its not confined to 
bridgeport he said 
walsh 72 scored his biggest victory when he turned the tables 
on an fbi attempt to entice him to accept a 30000 bribe in 1981 
he had been identified as the target of a grand jury 
investigation into the police department that year when the fbi 
sent tommy marra jr a convicted car thief whose family had known 
walsh for decades to meet him and offer the bribe wearing a 
concealed microphone 
but marra allegedly tipped the chief who showed up at the 
meeting wearing his own concealed microphone when marra handed 
over a 5000 installment on the bribe walsh arrested him marra 
is now serving a 65year sentence for kidnapping a former associate 
walsh owned the town and whatever he wanted to do he did 
said richard gregorie who was then attorney in charge of the 
organized crime strike force in connecticut and now a us attorney 
in florida 
there were a number of allegations regarding organized crime 
connections with the chief of police 
walsh dismissed the allegations and said the sting was the 
work of overzealous prosecutors 
everyone knows im honest when i was a detective captain i 
bought my clothes at the pawn shop thats how honest i was he 
said 
former mayor leonard paoletta tried unsuccessfully to remove 
walsh from 1983 to 1985 for what he claimed was poor leadership he 
said walsh made himself virtually untouchable by keeping files on 
politicians 
he is known to have what i think of as insurance policies on 
many individuals skeletons in their closets paoletta said 
everyone was concerned about those things going public so they 
backed off tucking their tail between their legs and going home 
walsh scoffed at that i never had a file i knew a lot of 
people and if they violated a law they would have been locked up 
earlier this month in walshs last battle in office current 
mayor thomas w bucci stripped him of his power to authorize 
overtime turning it over to the police board because of a city 
fiscal crisis walsh responded by halting foot patrols in four 
highcrime areas but to no avail bucci ordered walsh to restore 
the details without giving back his overtime authority 
bucci said he has the greatest respect for walsh and didnt 
pressure him to retire but some colleagues who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said walsh who suffered pneumonia earlier this year 
and whose wife christine has had two strokes recently had lost 
the taste for fights 
walsh said he retired to spend more time with his wife three 
children and eight grandchildren 
ive been on the job for 47 years and i feel guilty ive been 
away from my wife to play cops and robbers while she raised our 
family he said

but marra allegedly tipped the chief who showed up at the 
meeting wearing his own concealed microphone when marra handed 
over a 5000 installment on the bribe walsh arrested him marra 
is now serving a 65year sentence for kidnapping a former associate 
walsh owned the town and whatever he wanted to do he did 
said richard gregorie who was then attorney in charge of the 
organized crime strike force in connecticut and now a us attorney 
in florida 
there were a number of allegations regarding organized crime 
connections with the chief of police 
walsh dismissed the allegations and said the sting was the 
work of overzealous prosecutors 
everyone knows im honest when i was a detective captain i 
bought my clothes at the pawn shop thats how honest i was he 
said 
former mayor leonard paoletta tried unsuccessfully to remove 
walsh from 1983 to 1985 for what he claimed was poor leadership he 
said walsh made himself virtually untouchable by keeping files on 
politicians 
he is known to have what i think of as insurance policies on 
many individuals skeletons in their closets paoletta said 
everyone was concerned about those things going public so they 
backed off tucking their tail between their legs and going home 
walsh scoffed at that i never had a file i knew a lot of 
people and if they violated a law they would have been locked up 
earlier this month in walshs last battle in office current 
mayor thomas w bucci stripped him of his power to authorize 
overtime turning it over to the police board because of a city 
fiscal crisis walsh responded by halting foot patrols in four 
highcrime areas but to no avail bucci ordered walsh to restore 
the details without giving back his overtime authority 
bucci said he has the greatest respect for walsh and didnt 
pressure him to retire but some colleagues who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said walsh who suffered pneumonia earlier this year 
and whose wife christine has had two strokes recently had lost 
the taste for fights 
walsh said he retired to spend more time with his wife three 
children and eight grandchildren 
ive been on the job for 47 years and i feel guilty ive been 
away from my wife to play cops and robbers while she raised our 
family he said

nation of islam leader louis farrakhan rejected a 
grand jurys conclusion that a black teenager fabricated her story 
about being raped by six white men and has vowed vengeance 
you raped my daughter and i will kill you and dismember your 
body and feed it to the fowl of the air the black muslim 
minister declared sunday before an audience of 10000 people at the 
religious sects annual meeting 
as farrakhan spoke about tawana brawley he held and patted the 
16yearold girls hand 
they would have us believe she did this to herself 
farrakhan said 
they tell us she took dog excrement a girl of her 
intelligence and wiped dog excrement on her and got into a 
plastic bag that she scrawled kkk on her chest and nigger on her 
body and faked the condition she was in after the brutal beasts 
took her into their hands 
farrakhan referred to miss brawley as a mighty young 
warrior and said she had asked him to give her a muslim name 
she arrived friday for the groups annual meeting and told a 
news conference saturday she stood by her story and had evidence 
to back it up 
on thursday a new york grand jury issued a 170page report 
based on a sevenmonth investigation saying it had found no 
evidence that miss brawley had been sexually assaulted 
the panel contended the teenager herself was responsible for 
the condition in which she was found after a fourday disappearance 
last november in wappingers falls ny 75 miles north of new york 
city 
miss brawley was found nov 28 seemingly dazed outside an 
apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in 
wappingers falls her body was smeared with dog feces and marked 
with racial slurs 
she claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by 
several white men including one who carried a policetype badge 
and she implicated several law enforcement officials in the attack 
but miss brawley and her mother glenda refused to cooperate 
with the grand jury investigation on the recommendation of their 
advisers who had accused authorities of a racially motivated 
coverup 
miss brawley was accompanied to chicago by her mother and 
family advisers the rev al sharpton and lawyers c vernon mason 
and alton maddox jr 
before the speech maddox announced that he mason and sharpton 
would donate 1000 to the nation of islam 
farrakhan called sharpton the baddest black brother on the 
east coast and on the west coast 
farrakhan has steadfastly supported brawley and sharpton called 
him the only credible national leader left in black america

the federal trade commission is interviewing 
hundreds of florida doctors and demanding minutes from medical 
societies meetings in an investigation of emergency room boycotts 
last year a newspaper reported 
i dont see any smoking guns said john thrasher general 
counsel for the florida medical association my guess is had they 
had something it would have developed by now and something would 
have been done about it 
the ftc is questioning doctors to determine if they acted as 
individuals or as a group when they began refusing emergency calls 
in response to a 33 percent to 42 percent hike in insurance 
premiums the miami herald reported sunday 
federal antitrust laws prohibit businesses from acting together 
for financial gain 
were intimidated said dr charles lipman a thoracic 
surgeon in north miami beach its kind of like youre up against 
the big boys and thats scary 
the ftc wont discuss the growing investigation but lipman and 
dade county hospital officials said hundreds of doctors have been 
questioned either voluntarily or after being subpoenaed 
some doctors who canceled their insurance saw eliminating 
emergency room work as a way to reduce the risk of being sued 
their actions captured the attention of politicians who promised to 
do something about the cost of malpractice insurance in florida 
last spring the legislature passed a law making it harder to 
gain damages in lawsuits from doctors who deliver babies and work 
in emergency rooms injured people must now prove the doctor showed 
reckless disregard for their care and all lawsuits involving 
braindamaged babies are handled by a state compensation system 
instead of the courts 
the changes stabilized insurance premiums and brought some 
doctors back to emergency rooms 
but many more are refusing to return unless florida voters 
approve amendment 10 on the november ballot the law would ease 
their malpractice insurance burden by capping noneconomic damages 
or those a jury would give for pain and suffering at 100000 
the ftc began last year to investigate whether doctors were 
legally trying to change the state malpractice law or illegally 
trying to pad their wallets 
the agency has forced some medical societies to hand over 
minutes from meetings and all written communication between its 
members that includes identical letters the palm beach 
obstetricians sent to hospitals announcing the boycott 
ftc spokeswoman dee ellison said the agency will try to make 
doctors found to have violated antitrust laws to agree to stop 
refusing emergency room care if an agreement cant be reached the 
agency can bring the doctors to trial and impose civil penalties of 
fines or community service if it wins

nationalist china celebrated its national 
day today with a massive military parade that was considered a show 
of support for taiwanborn president lee tenghui 
the 70minute parade in front of the presidential building 
where lee and other officials watched included a march by 13000 
goosestepping cadets soldiers and barechested frogmen and 600 
armed vehicles as well as domesticallydeveloped longrange 
missiles and other weapons 
air force jet fighters and helicopters flew in formation over 
the large crowd in the parade area that included 30000 overseas 
chinese many of whom will be taken later at government expense to 
visit major military bases hightechnology companies and scenic 
spots around the island 
lee 65 has been president since january when president chiang 
chingkuo died he is the first native taiwanese to hold the post 
and there have been reports that the islands generals have gained 
added power at his expense since strongman chiangs death 
analysts said the emphasis on military might may also have been 
intended to emphasize to china that there has been no softening of 
taiwans anticommunist stance despite an easing of tensions 
between the rival governments in the past year 
our armed forces have proved their strength in the parade 
lee told the gathering after the parade we can give the 
warmongering chinese communist authorities a frontal attack 
lee said the nationalists are determined to recover the chinese 
mainland and reunite china under the three principles of 
nationalism democracy and social welfare advocated by sun yatsen 
founded of the chinese republic who died in 1925 
taiwan held 15 military parades after 1949 when the nationalists 
were defeated on the china mainland and retreated to taiwan but 
since the mid60s the parades have concentrated more on 
publicizing taiwans economic successes and civilian lifestyles 
rather than its military strength 
the nationalists and communists are technically still at war but 
the late president chiang adopted a more open policy toward china 
in 1987 when he lifted martial law and relaxed a ban on travel to 
the mainland to allow family reunions 
national day celebrations were also held in other cities and 
they included mass rallies folk dances concerts exhibitions and 
fireworks

lucianno pavarotti named 40 singers who are 
winners of the third opera company of philadelphialucianno 
pavarotti international voice competition 
but i must tell you they are all winners said pavarotti 
late sunday as he stood on stage at the academy of music at the 
conclusion of the final auditions that featured 70 finalists 
he had them all join him and take a bow along with the winners 
the competition began 1 years ago with 1500 singers that was 
narrowed to 140 finalists from 18 countries who completed their 
auditions during the last week here 
they werent competing for medals money or first second or 
third place the 40 winners now get the chance to perform with 
pavarotti 
just to get a chance to sing for him to listen to what he has 
to say is worth it said izabella labuda a polish soprano who 
was among the 70 but not among the winners 
there were 19 winners in the first competition that began in 
1980 with 500 singers and 54 in the second from a field of 1000 
the format for selecting winners has drawn criticism 
rumanianborn bass julian rodescu now a us citizen living 
here was in the audience three years ago and said he was like 
those critics in asking how could they have 54 winners 
but as one of this years winners he said the whole thing makes 
sense 
no one else but he pavarotti could do something like this 
rodescu said there is no other competition where there is 
someone of his caliber to hear you and to help you 
this is where someone is trying to find to single out and to 
help talented singers by giving them recognition 
pavarotti who owes his own beginnings to a voice competition 
decided to start his own so he could return the favor to the 
audiences who made him what he is today also he said he wanted to 
help find new talent 
the proof of his competition pavarotti said is that 85 percent 
of previous winners are fulltime singers and the competition 
proved to be a big boost for them 
pavarotti will return to the academy in march and april in his 
normal role of opera superstar to lead casts for two operas 
featuring competition winners 
each opera will have two sets of cast members from the winners 
others not in those productions will be offered roles in other 
operas during the next two seasons according to margaret anne 
everitt opera company general director and one of the three 
judges the third judge was antonio tonini pavarottis own vocal

opposition sen juan ponce enrile 
denied today that he or any of his relatives had any links with an 
alleged new plot to topple president corazon aquino 
enrile made the denial during a radio interview after mrs 
aquinos speechwriter wrote in the philippine daily globe that 
enrile and his sister were linked to a new plot codenamed oplan 
three kings 
in the report teodoro locsin the globes publisher quoted 
national security adviser emmanuel soriano as saying that the plot 
involves an unidentified senator and a sister 
but locsin claimed the senator was enrile and his sister irma 
ponce enrilepotenciano who owns a bus company 
soriano was quoted as saying the unidentified senator will fund 
the rebellion which will be pulled off next january around the 
feast of the epiphany on jan 6 
the feast marks the visit of the three kings to the infant 
jesus thus the codename 
according to the globe report the plot called for buses to 
ferry a main force of renegade soldiers led by cashiered lt col 
gregorio honasan 
i am calling soriano a liar enrile said i challenge 
soriano to come out with details of the oplan three kings so that 
we can discuss it in any proper forum 
soriano later denied having told locsin of the alleged plot 
i dont know who came out with that story i am making an 
official denial soriano said in a radio interview 
defense secretary fidel ramos told reporters that he was aware 
of the rumored plot but said his information was based on raw 
intelligence he said it was unlikely honasan was capable of 
mounting another coup 
mrs aquinos government has survived at least six coup attempts 
since it was catapulted to power during a civilianmilitary revolt 
in february 1986 
honasan with a force of more than 2000 soldiers led the most 
serious attempt against mrs aquinos government at least 53 
people were killed and more than 300 others wounded during the 
failed aug 28 1987 coup 
the renegade colonel was arrested in december but escaped from a 
prison ship the following april 
honasan was enriles security chief when the senator was defense 
minister under former president ferdinand marcos and mrs aquino 
enrile was fired on nov 23 1986 after a failed coup by his 
followers

skoplje to belgrade when its last two cars jumped off the rails at 
full speed at the lapovo station and rammed into an engine of a 
parked freight train tanjug said 
a belgrade radio report described the impact as tremendous 
initial findings suggest that technical failure rather than 
human error was the cause of the accident as the engine driver 
reportedly entered the station observing all signals and did not 
exceed speed limits the agency said

the antigraft court today dismissed 
a petition by ousted president ferdinand marcos to return home to 
witness the testimony of a former official on alleged kickbacks 
during his 20year administration 
in a ninepage resolution the court said marcos presence would 
not be necessary when former public works minister baltazar aquino 
who is reportedly ailing gives his deposition nov 7 to nov 11 
marcos asked the court to allow him to return for the deposition 
and act as his own defense counsel but the court said the granting 
of marcos request to return was a political question which the 
government of mrs aquino must decide 
marcos fled the country during the february 1986 
civilianmilitary rebellion that ended his 20year rule and 
catapulted mrs aquino to the presidency he has lived in exile in 
hawaii since 
in its decision the court said marcos can be represented by a 
lawyer in manila 
marcos can answer the charges by disposition which is by 
issuing legal statements from his home in honolulu the decision 
said 
it added that marcos recourse is to ask mrs aquino to 
issue him travel documents to return to the philippines 
mrs aquino has repeatedly refused to allow marcos to return 
citing national security 
lawyers for marcos in manila had earlier stated that if the 
lower court rejected the former presidents petition they would 
appeal the case to the supreme court 
marcos has not been formally charged in any philippine court 
philippine law bans trials in absentia and the mrs aquinos 
government has delayed criminal proceedings for fear marcos would 
insist on attending the trial 
marcos is facing 39 civil cases on charges he embezzled up to 
10 billion during his term 
much of the money is believed to have been stashed in secret 
swiss bank accounts swiss authorities have refused to lift banking 
secrecy laws until the philippine government files criminal charges 
against marcos

a fugitive financiers return to the united states 
could lead to the recovery of some of the 25 million he allegedly 
embezzled from investors an official said 
the fbi arrested henry gherman 52 as he got off a plane in 
tokyo on saturday after he was expelled from taiwan said fbi agent 
william wells 
he has been a federal fugitive since august on charges of 
embezzlement and mail fraud he may have been in taiwan as long as 
six weeks wells said 
there is a stronger likelihood now that he has been arrested 
that we will recover substantial funds said james feltman the 
courtappointed overseer for ghermans two investment concerns 
authorities said gherman stayed in luxury hotels costing up to 
300 a night and spent lavishly on room service and telephone calls 
to the united states 
at the time of his arrest gherman was carrying up to 30000 in 
us money and a sizable amount of taiwanese currency wells 
said 
gherman is accused of masterminding a scheme that may have 
swindled nearly 50 investors us attorney dexter lehtinen said in 
a federal complaint filed aug 29 in us district court 
authorities said the investigation of ghermans activities 
continues and additional charges are expected 
we think well be successful in locating some of those 
funds wells said we dont know how much we just dont know 
how much is left 
feltman said actions against third parties can help mitigate 
losses 
there are a lot of financial institutions who aided him 
knowingly or unknowingly said john schulte attorney for an 
association of seven doctors for whom gherman handled a 15 
million pension fund they could be subject to claims 
the secret is to get this guy back without him you have to 
speculate and recreate but with him you have the person who is 
the star witness 
gherman had a longstanding pattern of embezzlement from 
about 25 professional associations handling pension funds and other 
assets for members lehtinen said ghermans scheme could have 
affected nearly 50 investors including smaller investors such as 
clerks and nurses 
gherman made telephone calls to his wife and to miami attorneys 
after his disappearance but authorities were unaware of his 
whereabouts until us citizens in taiwan reported his possible 
location there agents said authorities then found him and 
arranged his expulsion said wells 
wells said that if gherman agrees he could be brought to miami 
within a week but if he fights extradition the process could take 
as long as 45 days 
gherman is charged with five counts of embezzlement and two 
counts of mail fraud he faces 35 years in prison and fines in 
excess of 15 million if convicted on all counts lehtinen said

pope john paul ii called today for a new 
economic restructuring in an homily delivered to roman catholics 
in a smokestack region of france afflicted by the decline of mining 
and heavy industry 
at a mass here on the third day of his fourday trip to 
northeastern france the pontiff urged roman catholics to look to 
their faith for courage in confronting crisis in society 
today the economic recession is leaving a large number of 
residents of lorraine without work he told thousands of people 
packed into the soaring gothic cathedral of st etienne in metz 
it is a difficult problem you are all invited to do 
everything you can to bring about a new economic restructuring that 
will offer everyone the possibility of work and a dignified life 
although the alsacelorraine region reports an unemployment rate 
only slightly higher than the national average of 105 percent the 
jobless rate in industrial cities in the region is higher 
the decline in heavy industry and mining has particularly hurt 
immigrants who came in waves from europe and north africa during 
the industrial boom years of the 1960s and 1970s and now make up 
nearly 10 percent of the population of metz and the surrounding 
area 
the 68yearold pope resplendent in a glittering gold robe 
spoke to an overflow crowd bathed in sunlight pouring in through 
brilliant stained glass windows 
he appealed to them to build a strong faith to withstand changes 
in society although france is overwhelmingly roman catholic only 
a small percentage practice their faith 
the pope called on catholics to construct a more humane society 
and added the task is immense but god will not abandon you 
on sunday the pope sailed down the rhine river between france 
and west germany to bless boatmen and port workers as men whose 
vision transcends national boundries 
you constitute an inspiring milieu which shows a solidarity 
frontiers cannot stop the pontiff 
his speech delivered in german and french stressed the main 
theme of this trip the unification of europe 
later sunday the pope condemned antisemitism in a meeting with 
representatives of strasbourgs jewish community saying it was 
opposed to the principles of christianity 
masses were also to be said today in nancy on tuesday the 
polishborn pontiff was scheduled to talk to the european 
parliament a speech that will be the centerpiece of his visit and 
will set forth the roman catholic churchs vision of a unified 
continent 
the parliament represents the european economic community or 
common market whose 12 member nations have agreed to eliminate all 
trade barriers between them and integrate their economies by 1992 
the decision has has touched off widespread debate about whether 
western europe should move toward becoming a single political unit 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain recently provoked 
protests when she declared a usstyle european union would be 
highly damaging to the individual states 
pope john paul has addressed european unity in a broader sense 
during this trip urging the eec countries as well as eastern 
europe and those nations of western europe that are not part of the 
eec to nurture their common heritage which includes christianity

a divorced father is helping to make a 
movie about his sevenyear custodyvisitation battle over his 
daughters but the girls mother has gone to court in hopes of 
stopping what she sees as exploitation 
don chavez president of the national congress for men in 
washington and founder of the albuquerquebased dads against 
discrimination said the movie will be about dad trying to regain 
a meaningful place in the lives of his children 
the plot has a father organizing a group of other fathers in the 
same situation in an attempt to change the way judges award custody 
and visitation rights 
what fathers do not see coming is the reality of getting 
laundered from their children or emotionally amputated from their 
children when they get divorced from their wives and thats what 
happened to me chavez said and so the story starts with that 
kind of a loving father who struggles for the better part of a 
decade to regain his status as a real parent 
a real parent does not mean being uncle dad or a disneyland 
dad who visits with his children on weekends 
the girls mother marilyn chavez newhouse has asked state 
district judge robert thompson to appoint a guardian to determine 
if the movie is in their best interest and to decide how to protect 
them from future publicity 
daughters leticia 13 and michelle 11 live with chavez 38 a 
bureau of indian affairs administrator during the school year and 
with their remarried mother during the summer 
mrs newhouse contends in her petition that chavez who also has 
remarried failed to consult with her about the effect or 
advisability of exposing the children to additional media 
exploitation 
chavez said mrs newhouse wont communicate with him except 
through their attorneys he said his daughters favor the idea of a 
movie 
chavez would not say what production company is making the film 
and said hes unsure when the movie will be ready because of delays 
caused first by the writers strike and now by the hollywood 
teamsters strike

communist authorities today imposed 
urgent measures in the capital of the tense southern republic 
of montenegro where thousands of people demonstrated in defiance 
of a presidential order 
the state news agency tanjug carrying a statement by 
montenegros state presidency said the urgent measures are being 
applied because of a sudden deterioration of the political and 
security situation and the possibility that it will spread 
today thousands of workers and students in the republics 
capital of titograd and two other montenegrin towns continued to 
stage rallies and a protest fast twelve people were reported 
arrested 
the statement carried by tanjug said the unspecified urgent 
measures will be of a restrictive nature aimed only against 
those who are abusing the rightful demands of workers and other 
citizens 
the language indicated police patrols would be stepped up and 
firm action taken against provocative public protests but it 
suggested authorities would stop short of using restrictions such 
as curfews at least for the time being 
on sunday president raif dizdarevics warned that emergency 
measures would be imposed if ethnic and economic unrest in 
yugoslavia did not cease 
a national economic crisis fueled by 217 percent inflation a 
21 billion dollar debt and 15 percent unemployment has combined 
with tensions between serbs and ethnic albanians to fuel three 
months of protests and calls for an overhaul in the party hierarchy 
in kosovo one of two autonomous provinces in the southern 
republic of serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics 
serbs have rallied against the ethnic albanian communist leaders 
the mainly christian serb demonstrators want more control over the 
mainly moslem ethnic albanian majority in kosovo 
the statement carried by tanjug today specifically attacked what 
it branded nationalist and anticommunist demands voiced during a 
titograd rally that was broken up by clubwielding riot police 
early on saturday 
this morning in the north montenegrin town of niksic several 
hundred high school and university students rallied in front of a 
government building tanjug said several thousand striking steel 
workers rallied at factory management offices 
the news agency said that 12 people were arrested during an 
overnight rally in niksic and face charges for disturbing the peace 
the continuing protests defied a warning made by dizdarevic in a 
hastily scheduled speech on national television sunday night 
dizdarevic who heads the ninemember collective state 
presidency which acts as supreme commander of the armed forces 
appealed sunday for calm promised changes in the communist 
leadership and urged the government to undertake effective 
economic measures 
in his speech dizdarevic said recent serbian nationalist 
rallies and worker protests are seriously jeopardizing public 
order 
there is a real danger that the actions which are imperiling 
constitutional order could continue and spread he said 
dizdarevic promised unspecified measures to combat yugoslavias 
economic problems 
he also said the policymaking central committee which is 
scheduled to meet oct 17 will make changes in the countrys 
leadership but he did not say who might be replaced 
in troubled kosovo province on sunday 20000 people rallied to 
press serbian claims of harassment by the ethnic albanian majority 
no violence was reported at the rally in titovo mitrovica 145 
miles south of belgrade 
albanian halit trnavci told the crowd that serbs and albanians 
should protect links forged through the centuries 
serbs have been pushing for greater control over kosovo and 
vojvodina provinces and have embraced the drive of serbian leader 
slobodan milosevic who wants to increase his republics power

attorneys for john demjanjuk the retired 
american autoworker convicted as a nazi death camp guard accused 
israeli authorities today of telling a potential defense witness 
not to testify during the trial 
defense attorney yoram sheftel said a motion to present evidence 
from richard glazier a treblinka survivor living in switzerland 
was submitted today to the supreme court 
glazier refused to testify for the defense sheftel said 
the attorney said a taped conversation between glazier and an 
american attorney indicates that israeli authorities pressured 
glazier to withhold information that could have vindicated 
demjanjuk 
we are asking the court to inform mr glazier that he is not 
obliged to keep his mouth shut sheftel said this is a clear 
cut case of obstruction of justice 
demjanjuk 68 was sentenced to death in april after being 
identified as ivan the terrible a sadistic guard at the nazis 
treblinka death camp who operated gas chambers that killed 850000 
jews during world war ii he denied he was the guard 
he was convicted of crimes against humanity and crimes against 
the jewish people and is now in an israeli prison awaiting the 
outcome of an appeal of his conviction sentence 
sheftel reading from a transcript of the taped conversation 
involving glazier quoted him as saying i promised the general 
attorney who investigated me the israeli attorney not to talk to 
anybody as long as the trial is not closed 
sheftel said that when asked if demjanjuk was ivan the 
terrible glazier replied i cant tell you maybe he wasnt 
at treblinka 
the conversation took place in 1986 when william wolf an 
attorney from phoenix ariz who assisted the demjanjuk defense 
questioned glazier sheftel said defense attorneys submitted a 
transcript of the conversation today and asked the court to allow 
the evidence in demjanjuks appeal sheftel said the appeal is 
scheduled for dec 5 
a spokesman for the prosecuting attorneys in the case said they 
have not seen the motion filed by sheftel and would not comment on 
it glazier who lives in zurich switzerland could not 
immediately be reached for comment 
sheftel said he spoke to glazier a few times since the 1986 
conversation with wolf and each time glazier told him he was asked 
by authorities to keep quiet during demjanjuks trial 
he promised not to talk but he doesnt say why sheftel 
said its clear the defense was not able to bring all of the 
evidence to the trial this casts strong reservations on all of the 
proceedings 
during demjanjuks trial defense attorneys said there were 
death camp survivors who failed to identify the defendant as ivan 
the terrible but the defense did not produce any of them as

about 1000 guerrillas trying to seize a 
government post fought fierce battles with soldiers along the river 
border with thailand today a government spokesman said 
the karen guerrillas raided perimeter outposts on sept 26 then 
sent reinforcements to attack government troops at methawaw on the 
western bank of the moei river said the spokesman kyaw sann 
more than 150 rounds from mortars and recoiless rifles fired 
from the thai side of the river crashed into methawaw on sunday 
he told reporters shells fired by the guerrillas inside burma also 
struck thai territory he said 
the area is about 130 miles northeast of rangoon 
the fighting occurred less than a month after military commander 
gen saw maung seized power from a civilian government and brutally 
suppressed widespread antigovernment protests led by students and 
buddhist months 
kyaw sann who gave no casualty figures said the fighting 
continued today in the second biggest engagement since sept 30 
when government forces drove back 2000 guerrillas of the burma 
communist party from mong yang in the east the guerrillas had 
attacked the government outpost sept 23 
the government had said more than 200 communist guerrillas and 
47 soldiers including five officers were killed in that fighting 
in the northeast near mongko and kyukok areas we noticed the 
burma communist party massing troops recently kyaw sann said 
we are also preparing for any assault from them 
the karens an ethnicbased group and the communists are the 
countrys two most powerful insurgencies they have been fighting 
the government for decades the karens seeking greater autonomy for 
their areas 
kyaw sann also acknowledged that more than 3000 students had 
joined the rebel groups since saw maung seized power in rangoon 
sept 18 he said some of the students were receiving military 
training 
officials of three rebel groups told reporters in thailand on 
sunday that 4000 students and other civilians had joined their 
ranks 
students were at the forefront of prodemocracy demonstrations 
in rangoon but they were driven underground by saw maungs troops 
who have killed at least 440 people since the takeover 
kyaw sann said 2000 of the students had joined the karens and 
500 joined the communists while the rest joined five other rebel 
groups 
the karens are among a dozen major ethnic minority groups in 
burma a country of 38 million people the karens who live largely 
along the thaiburmese border and in the irrawaddy delta number 2 
million during the colonial period large numbers were converted to 
christianity by american and other missionaries and enjoyed 
relative freedom under the british rule 
feeling that the promise of autonomy within a federal system 
after independence had been broken a number of karens fled to 
jungle areas along the thaiburmese border and in 1949 rose up in 
rebellion managing to fight their way to the gates of rangoon 
before being pushed back to their sanctuaries 
karen leader gen bo mya said recently that his insurgent group 
called the karen national union fields 17000 troops

vice president george bush said today he 
would study the federal prison furlough system to make sure it 
never slips into the massachusetts model 
bush said he would review everything about the system if 
elected 
bushs remarks came aboard air force two as he flew to new 
jersey one of several key tossup states the vice president will 
focus on in the final weeks before the nov 8 election his 
columbus day speech today was to focus on crime and the rights of 
victims 
reporters asked bush about a remark by his chief of staff craig 
fuller that bush favors reviewing the federal furlough system 
asked if he had any specific reservations about the program he 
said i dont have any specific feelings at all i just want 
to be sure it never slips into the massachusetts model 
bush has been highly critical of the massachusetts furlough 
system accusing rival michael dukakis of overseeing a system that 
allowed murderers out on weekend passes 
bush had a light campaign schedule this week ahead of the 
thursday night debate with dukakis 
aides to bush known in the past for deliberately seeking to 
lower expectations for their candidates performances suggested 
that the republican nominees preparations this time would be less 
intense than the last perhaps even dispensing with a mock 
practice debate 
we view it the second debate as being important but we 
dont look for it making a big difference in the campaign fuller 
said 
on sunday bush participated in a parade in an ethnic chicago 
suburb the visit marked the fifth time the vice president has been 
to illinois which has 24 electoral votes since formally accepting 
the republican nomination in august 
aides said both illinois and new jersey with its 16 electoral 
votes are deemed critical battlegrounds where the contest could go 
either way 
the vice president also will take advantage of the los angeles 
site for this weeks presidential debate to base operations in 
california for several days beginning tuesday bush will prepare 
for the debate interrupted by short campaign forays in the state 
with the most electoral votes 47 
aides said bushs california campaigning will be capped by a 
daylong bus tour of rural communities in the states central valley 
next saturday 
the presidential debate is scheduled for thursday although the 
date could change if rainouts force the national league baseball 
series to be extended 
fuller said the vice president engaged in several hours of 
debate preparation with aides on sunday morning bush was spending 
this afternoon alone with briefing books at his washington 
residence without aides or advisers fuller said 
the aide said former deputy treasury secretary richard darman 
bushs sparring partner in practice for the first debate would be 
in los angeles on a standby basis but there is a good chance 
there wont be a mock debate fuller said 
he bush is comfortable with debate preparations so far 
the chief of staff said 
on sunday bush and his wife barbara rode in an oldfashioned 
fire truck and waved as thousands of people lined a twomile parade 
route between cicero and berwin ill in the annual houby day 
parade a czechoslovakian celebration of bountiful mushroom crops 
houby is a czech word for mushroom 
this is the day we celebrate family we celebrate faith and we 
celebrate freedom bush said in brief remarks at the beginning of 
the parade and none of us will ever forget there is not freedom 
in eastern europe and i have pledged as president to never forget 
that 
to scattered protesters chanting the antibush chant where was 
george bush at one point gestured toward himself and said im 
here he then called out where is mike

at the end of three days of intensive talks among several 
palestinian factions at palestine liberation organization 
headquarters in tunis tunisia 
the plo has been debating for months its agenda for the future 
of the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip in light of the 
10month uprising by the 15 million palestinian inhabitants it

jordans administrative links with the occupied territories in july 
on sunday the staterun newspaper alittihad of abu dhabi 
quoted plo spokesman jameel hilal as saying that oct 25 has been 
fixed as date for the council session and that the meetings will be 
held as scheduled in algiers 
but khalaf indicated the algiers site might be changed possibly 
because of the riots in the north african country 
khalaf also known as abu iyad denied reports that the soviet 
union asked the plo to postpone declaration of a palestinian state 
the soviets have told us they support any plo decision he 
said 
khalaf said that a plo delegation led by farouk kaddoumi head 
of the plo political department had left tunis for moscow to sound 
out soviet leaders on future plo steps

abortion opponents have ended their 
demonstrations for the time being leaving 282 people still in jail 
today after a week of protests 
about 137 of those still jailed have applied for bond but have 
not been processed tom pocock deputy director of the atlanta 
corrections bureau said this morning 
he said the 137 had given their names to authorities and should 
be released by thursday police arrested 463 people during the 
recent protests and had released 181 by this morning pocock said 
he said 145 others in custody had not applied for bond and had 
not given their real names 
many of those arrested identify themselves only as baby jane 
doe or baby john doe and cannot be freed on bond the city 
says the protesters say the doe names symbolize their 
solidarity with aborted fetuses 
operation rescue the new yorkbased organization that organized 
the protests has accused the city of purposely delaying the 
releases to keep the demonstrators in jail until the organizers 
leave 
the city accuses operation rescue of boasting that it would clog 
the citys judicial process with hundreds of arrests and says the 
demonstrators succeeded 
the aim of the week of demonstrations was to block clinic 
entrances to prevent women from entering or persuade them not to 
have abortions clinic operators said most of the appointments were 
kept and some brought patients in before dawn to avoid the pickets 
processing of the prisoners has been delayed because city 
officials have refused to separate the paperwork of operation 
rescue prisoners from that of other cases the prisoners have 
complained of inadequate bedding and towels 
pocock said the city had received a list from operation rescue 
of those who should be released first based on family job or 
health concerns and about 40 of those on the list had been 
released 
since operation rescue came to atlanta in july for the 
democratic national convention police have arrested 1235 
demonstrators even before last weeks resumption of 
demonstrations city officials said they had spent more than 
500000 on security arrests jail and court costs

michael dukakis today visited this 
postworld war ii model community to unveil a housing program that 
would allow firsttime buyers to use ira and pension savings for a 
down payment on a home 
the democratic presidential nominee told a levittown gathering 
that the reaganbush administration had broken the federal 
governments longstanding promise to help families buy their first 
home 
we rolled up our sleeves democrats and republicans alike 
and made a great national promise a promise to provide affordable 
housing for all americans dukakis said of the initiatives which 
helped build levittown 
the administration that mr bush has been a part of broke that 
promise in the early 1980s dukakis said he delivered the speech 
at a high school after visiting with lou and betty tolano owners 
of one of the original levittown homes and several of their 
children 
among them was to be steve tolano and his wife lisa who are 
expecting a baby and are living with the elder tolanos because they 
cannot afford a home but lisa tolano went into labor prior to the 
meeting and was taken to an area hospital 
dukakis was headed next into new york city to march in the 
columbus day parade 
dukakis chided the vice president for declaring that housing 
is up during their recent debate and also kept the heat on 
indiana sen dan quayle the republican vice presidential nominee 
hes right dukakis said of bushs debate statement 
housing is up so much its almost out of sight in much of this 
country since this administration took office the price of houses 
has raced ahead of peoples wages and has made it impossible for 
many people to buy the homes they grew up in 
george bush has no housing program he continued he has 
no solutions he has no new ideas 
dukakis blamed reagan administration cuts in housing programs 
for the escalation of homelessness in the past eight years and said 
much of the problem was rooted in the lack of affordable housing 
for young families 
the dukakis plan called home start would allow firsttime 
homebuyers to use their individual retirement account or other 
taxdeferred pension savings for a down payment on a home dukakis 
said the plan was a natural extension of the goal behind such 
accounts 
under current law young families can speculate on stocks or 
gold or soybean futures with these funds dukakis said home 
start will let them make the best investment they can in a home 
for their families 
dukakis in the speech said the program also would include 
provisions to lower down payments and closing costs and to raise 
borrowing limits on federally guaranteed mortgages he did not cite 
a cost estimate and campaign aides were not immediately available 
to discuss the plan 
dukakis said the program would complement his proposal for a 
national partnership for affordable housing which is modeled after 
a massachusetts program that uses some state money and agreements 
with private developers to build moderately priced housing for 
firsttime buyers 
george bush and his friends are satisfied they say all is 
well dukakis said dan quayle is the only cloud on their 
horizon theyre right to worry about mr quayle and so are the 
american people 
dukakis who was accompanied on his new york stops by gov mario 
cuomo and john f kennedy jr was returning to boston after the 
parade and was spending the afternoon preparing for his second and 
final debate with bush thursday in los angeles the massachusetts 
governor was flying to california on tuesday and was to remain 
there through the debate

cheryl pierson the high school 
cheerleader who hired a classmate to kill her father after what she 
said were years of sexual abuse has married the wellheeled gucci image 
suffered its first jolt when paolo 
proposed more inexpensive products and licensing and his relatives 
opposed the plans 
the disagreement exploded into an argument at a 1982 board 
meeting and according to a suit filed by paolo his relatives 
smashed a tape recorder over his head 
they denied the charge and the case was eventually dismissed 
in a subsequent lawsuit by paolo charging that his family had 
blocked his efforts to trade under his own name produced documents 
alleging that his father 81yearold aldo evaded taxes in the 
united states the suit was dismissed but the us internal 
revenue service picked up on the documents and in january 1986 
aldo pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a federal court in 
new york city he was sentenced to a year in prison but was allowed 
to serve part of his sentence at a halfway house in west palm 
beach fla 
gucci relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart 
the family and the firm it had built 
the company was a part of my life says giorgio paolos 
older brother i had always smelled the perfume of leather had 
always watched my grandfather in the shop in florence working with 
so much energy 
in 1984 maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize 
control and oust aldo the young bespectacled maurizio brought in 
a new team of managers 
the board decided the company had to be professionally 
managed explains cucchiani one of the young americaneducated 
executives 
but older family members saw it differently 
maurizio wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm says 
his cousin giorgio 
peace did not reign for long maurizios relatives alleged that 
the papers giving him half the company on his fathers death in 
1983 had forged signatures maurizios shares were frozen 
based on his relatives charges courts in florence and milan 
charged maurizio with exporting capital and evading taxes an 
arrest warrant was issued and maurizio took refuge in switzerland 
to replace him stateappointed custodians of his shares 
appointed a milan business professor maria martellini 
a new era has begun martellini says the company has a 
place in the market that is more important than the specific 
problems of the gucci family 
under its new management the company has launched a program to 
expand production standardize the quality of its stores and trim 
its product line which had expanded beyond leather goods to 
100000 items 
sales increased by nearly 4 percent from 2297 billion lire in 
1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 about 170 million at current 
exchange rates 
guccio guccis linked initials still adorn the firms handbags 
luggage and scarves and in workshops in florence apronclad 
artisans cut black and cobaltblue alligator skins and guide 
handbags through sewing machines 
but the guccis are nearly gone from gucci 
last spring giorgio and his brothers roberto and paulo decided 
to sell most of their shares in the company the purchaser was 
investcorp an arab investment bank 
while a judge ruled in july that 40yearold maurizio could 
return to italy his shares are frozen if he loses his court 
cases he may have to sell some 
giorgio says he parted with his shares because the new 
management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional 
standards 
the new managers however insist the company will continue to 
reflect the vision of guccio gucci 
there is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and 
feuds says cucchiani the strength is the consumer who wants 
this brand the strength is also with the people who work with the 
company that want the gucci splendor and the artisans that want 
that splendor 
the name has got a magic connotation

the states chief medical examiner has 
reopened an investigation into the death of a state police academy 
cadet in the wake of the hospitalization of 16 cadets at another 
state academy 
james whitehouse 22 of braintree died in 1985 after training 
at the police academy in framingham thenmedical examiner luke 
tedeschi ruled that whitehouse died from a genetic tendency to 
develop a disorder known as malignant hyperthermia 
however tedeschi has since called for the case to be reopened 
saying he made his diagnosis on the basis of faulty information 
including police claims that whitehouse had been exercising only 
moderately 
brian blackbourne the current state medical examiner has 
agreed to the request and started a new investigation into 
whitehouses death 
last month 16 cadets out of a class of 50 were hospitalized for 
dehydration kidney failure and other problems shortly after 
beginning training at another state police academy the one at 
agawam in western massachusetts one of the cadets later had to 
have a liver transplant and remains in critical condition 
academy officials have said the training was stressful to 
prepare the cadets for the stresses of police work but not abusive 
those who inherit the tendency toward malignant hyperthermia as 
whitehouse apparently did may fall prey during surgery to a 
potentially deadly combination of rapidly rising body temperature 
shock and other problems 
but tedeschi said there are no recorded cases of a person with 
the tendency dying after exercising in fact he said several 
professional football players have the disorder 
police instructors have maintained that whitehouse died of the 
genetic disorder and that the cadet was not subjected to enough 
strenuous exercise to cause heat stroke in a normal person they 
also have said that he received prompt medical attention 
however attorney john marani who is representing the whitehouse 
family said the cadet collapsed from heat stroke and was not given 
medical assistance for 45 minutes 
i feel the 45minute delay directly resulted in his death 
the attorney said

a judicial council today decided to 
extradite to the united states a palestinian accused of planting a 
bomb that killed one person and injured 15 aboard a pan am jetliner 
over hawaii in 1982 
however defense lawyers appealed to the areos pagos greeces 
supreme court to revoke the decision to extradite 39yearold 
mohammed rashid the countrys highest judicial body will hear the 
case within a month 
there is a majority decision by the council for extradition 
its decision is based on a portion of the us request appeals 
court judge stavros gardikiotis said under greek law the appeals 
council examines cases that involve crimes committed outside greece 
gardikiotis said there was enough evidence presented by the 
united states to back up its charges that rashid planted a bomb 
aboard the jetliner a japanese teenager was killed and 15 people 
injured in the explosion 
the council rejected as insufficient other us claims 
linking rashid to the attempted 1982 bombing of another pan am 
jetliner in rio de janeiro brazil no details of the alleged 
bombing attempt were released in court 
the council had twice postponed hearing the extradition request 
for rashid a member of the palestine liberation organization and 
delayed issuing its decision for one week 
this decision is a blow to the plo rashid told the 
associated press i will repeat once again that neither i nor the 
plo engage in terrorism i trust the greek justice system and will 
be vindicated by the areos pagos 
rashid also may be linked to an attack aboard the greek cruise 
ship on july 11 that killed nine people and injured 98 police 
theorize the attack may have been a botched attempt to take the 
ship hostage and force rashids release 
the palestinian was arrested at athens airport may 29 after a 
tip from the us embassy he was sentenced to seven months 
imprisonment on july 14 for entering greece on a forged syrian 
passport 
in a separate hearing today an appeal court upheld rashids 
passport conviction but reduced the sentence to five months he was 
allowed to pay a 400 fine instead of serving the sentence 
this doesnt mean he can go free he continues to be held 
until the extradition request is heard by the areos pagos said 
rashids lawyer spyros fitrakis he said the defense will argue 
that the greek constitution forbids the extradition of aliens 
prosecuted for their action as freedom fighters 
as a member of the plo my client is a freedom fighter 
fitrakis said 
the united states considers the plo a terrorist organization 
us officials have claimed rashid also was involved in the 1986 
bombing of a twa jetliner flying over southern greece that killed 
four americans the twa blast is not mentioned in the extradition 
request

george bushs presidential campaign hastily 
changed todays campaign event after a local knights of columbus 
official said the vice president was not welcome to make a 
political speech to the group 
bush toured an italian bakery and neighborhood before speaking 
to a gathering sponsored by an italianamerican group press 
secretary sheila tate said the knights of columbus a roman 
catholic mens group decided not to sponsor the speech because of 
its tax status as a nonprofit organization 
the knights of columbus cannot and will not take part in a 
program to be held for bush grand knight ben valeri told the times 
of trenton were not a dictatorship if members of the knights 
want to greet bush or any other political figure or want to go to 
the bush speech they can do so on their own but not as members of 
the knights of columbus 
however the head of the state knights of columbus bernie 
mcglone stood up at the bush gathering and declared i want to 
make it perfectly clear that the state council is sponsoring the 
event and were proud of it 
valeris wife had said earlier that her husband objected to the 
visit because the knights are supposed to be nonpolitical 
william palatucci executive director of the bush campaign in 
new jersey insisted that valeri agreed during phone conversations 
last week to take part in a bush visit 
i was as surprised as anyone to see his comments in the 
paper palatucci said when i spoke to him thursday and friday 
he said it would be an honor to have the vice president 
local bush organizer john hansburg said valeris remarks 
resulted from pressure by democratic committeemen 
hes closely connected to the democratic organization 
hansburg said they got to him 
hansburg said he didnt know which committeemen may have 
pressured valeri and said he had no evidence to support his claims 
palatucci said roman hall where the vice president was 
scheduled to speak monday is frequently rented but not owned by

two cars of an express passenger 
train derailed and slammed into a parked freight train at a 
station killing at least 33 people and injuring 15 the state 
tanjug news agency reported today 
one passenger was quoted as saying the express train entered the 
station in eastern yugoslavia at high speed then slammed on its 
breaks but the news agency said the driver obeyed all signals 
while entering the station 
the crash occurred at 720 pm sunday in lapovo 50 miles south 
of belgrade rescue teams worked through the night to reach the 
victims using blow torches to cut through the derailed coaches 
tanjug said 
the train was traveling from the southern city of skoplje to 
belgrade when its last two cars jumped off the rails at the lapovo 
station and rammed into an engine of a parked freight train tanjug 
said 
a belgrade radio report described the impact as tremendous 
initial findings suggest that technical failure rather than 
human error was the cause of the accident as the driver of the 
passenger train reportedly entered the station observing all 
signals the agency said 
i felt the train arrived in the station at full speed before 
braking suddenly we kept on sitting for 15 minutes without knowing 
what was going on merima cvetkovic of belgrade told the 
newspaper politika 
citizens offered their private vehicles to help ambulances 
transport the injured to hospitals 
the government of serbia today asked federal authorities to 
proclaim wednesday a day of national mourning for the victims but 
there was no immediate word on whether the request was approved

democrat michael dukakis today blamed the reaganbush 
administration for economic conditions that put affordable housing 
out of reach for many americans while republican george bush 
continued to depict his rival as soft on crime 
both candidates kept their schedules light in advance of a 
second presidential debate which campaign staffers now say will be 
held thursday night barring a rainout in the baseball playoffs 
dukakis and bush campaigned this morning but planned to spend 
the afternoon in preparation for their los angeles encounter 
in levitttown ny dukakis used the backdrop of a postworld 
war ii community to charge the administration with breaking the 
federal governments postwar promise to help families buy their 
first home 
since this administration took office the price of houses has 
raced ahead of peoples wages and has made it impossible for many 
people to buy the homes they grew up in dukakis said unveiling 
a program that would allow firsttime homebuyers to use their 
individual retirement account of taxdeferred pension savings for a 
downpayment on a home 
bush continued to rail against liberals on the crime issue 
saying frankly lawabiding americans are fed up with the cruel 
and unusual punishment inflicted on them by those who are soft on 
crime 
though he did not mention dukakis by name today bush has 
relentlessly criticized the former massachusetts furlough program 
under dukakis governorship he said in a conversation with 
reporters on air force two today that he favors review of the 
federal furlough program to make sure it doesnt slip into the 
massachusetts model 
meanwhile a series of state polls indicated that the republican 
nominee is solidifying his lead over dukakis 
statewide polls in kansas ohio new mexico and missouri showed 
bush leading dukakis while a survey of voters in 15 southern and 
border states found the republican nominee holding a 12point 
regional advantage over his democratic rival 
the poll of 2102 registered voters conducted last week by the 
atlanta journalconstitution showed bush leading dukakis 4937 
percent with 12 percent of those surveyed undecided 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage 
points 
bush led in every state including florida where he held a 
26point advantage and texas where despite the presence of lone 
star state sen lloyd bentsen on the democratic ticket the gop 
nominee enjoys a 14point lead 
both are highstakes electoral college states florida has 21 
electoral votes texas is the third biggest prize with 29 
the survey also included alabama delaware louisiana maryland 
mississippi oklahoma south carolina virginia west virginia 
georgia kentucky arkansas and north carolina 
with his support strong in the south bush turned his attention 
sunday to the midwest and the crucial state of illinois which has 
24 electoral votes 
the vice president and his wife barbara rode in an 
oldfashioned fire truck along a twomile parade route between 
cicero and berwin in the annual houby day parade a 
czechoslovakian celebration of bountiful mushroom crops 
this is the day we celebrate family we celebrate faith and we 
celebrate freedom bush said in brief remarks before the parade 
began and none of us will ever forget there is not freedom in 
eastern europe and i have pledged as president to never forget 
that 
earlier bush prepared for the nationally broadcast 90minute 
debate scheduled for thursday in the pauley pavilion on the 
university of california at los angeles campus 
the date had depended on the length of the american league 
baseball playoffs but that series ended sunday when the oakland 
as completed a sweep of the boston red sox 
if however rainouts extend the national league series the 
debate date could change dukakis spokesman mark gearan said sunday 
the bipartisan commission on presidential debates which assumed 
sponsorship of the debate after the league of women voters 
withdrew said friday that the confrontation would follow the 
format of the candidates first meeting in which bush and dukakis 
responded to questions from a panel of four reporters 
after days of conferring with their advisers the two candidates 
are expected to be ready with their rhetorical salvos unlike the 
comments bush made in a meeting last summer with an australian 
official 
newsweek magazine reported sunday that when prime minister bob 
hawke voiced concerned that dukakis might pull back us forces in 
the pacific the vice president sought to reassure the australian 
leader 
if dukakis wins youve nothing to worry about bush told 
hawke hes a solid fellow hell do all right by you

prospects for a 4nation agreement to pull 
cuban troops out of an african war were brighter today after 
negotiators substantially narrowed the gap on their 
differences us officials said 
although no final deal was struck cuban officials indicated 
they were willing to step up the pace of the withdrawal of 50000 
troops from angola as well as the 16000 to 18000 stationed near 
the border with namibia the officials said 
in exchange south africa would pull its troops from namibia and 
prepare the territory for independence and an election under united 
nations supervision of an assembly to draw up a constitution 
but the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
negotiators would have to meet again and that further significant 
decisions will be required before a final agreement is concluded 
the talks were held over the weekend in new york and involved 
officials from angola cuba south africa and the united states 
there already was a tentative understanding that the cuban 
troops would withdraw over 24 to 30 months some trainers were to 
remain behind to assist the sovietbacked government in its war 
with guerrillas supported by the united states and south africa 
however the questions were whether the withdrawal would be 
frontend loaded meaning a sizable pullout in the early stages 
to make the retreat irreversible and how quickly the troops near 
the namibian border would leave 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said further 
talks would be held soon but that it may not be possible to reach 
the nov 1 deadline set by the united nations for transition to 
independence for namibia 
still negotiators substantially narrowed the gap one of 
the officials told the associated press 
in johannesburg roland darroll a foreign affairs spokesman 
said south africa cuba and angola had agreed that cuban troops 
should be withdrawn from angola within 24 to 30 months 
that was the agreement in brazzaville it was subject to 
consultation with the governments he said 
he said he had no further information 
negotiators had not expected a breakthough at the new york 
meetings they were hastily arranged because senior diplomats from 
all the nations involved were in new york attending the 43rd un 
general assembly 
south africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with a 
oneyear independence plan for neighboring southwest africa which 
it rules to the withdrawal of the cuban troops pretoria which 
pulled its soldiers out of southwest africa earlier this year 
says cubas forces threaten the territorys independence 
diplomats involved in the talks had said they were working 
toward reaching agreement on a cuban withdrawal timetable at a 
formal meeting to be held sometime later this month in the west 
african nation of congo 
that meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are running 
out of time to achieve a compromise before nov 1 south africa has 
suggested that date for putting into effect the uns independence 
plan for southwest africa also known as namibia

the coast guard icebreaker polar star is at 
prudhoe bay in northern alaska preparing to travel east through 
the northwest passage after finding its usual route to the west 
blocked by ice the coast guard said today 
however whether the polar star will be allowed to make the 
trip through waters claimed by canada has been left up to the 
us state department lt pete marsh said 
the icebreaker polar sea traveled through the northwest passage 
in 1985 drawing canadas ire the united states government 
maintained then that the northwest passage was an international 
waterway 
rita ragsdale of the state departments watch office said 
today that no press officer was on duty to comment because of the 
columbus day holiday 
a decision on whether to dispatch the polar star presumably 
could have a further political impact in that the uscanada trade 
agreement has stalled in the canadian parliament congress has 
already approved it 
if the vessel doesnt head east said marsh it would have to 
winter over in the arctic with a skeleton crew as it did in 1981 
he said that while the polar star was preparing for departure 
no decision had been made to head east 
its definite only that they cannot head west he said 
they tried a couple of days ago and couldnt break through 
the polar star had been on a normal arctic research trip 
supporting scientists and their work when it was delayed because 
of assistance rendered to two canadian icebreakers and because of 
its own mechanical problems marsh said 
it took a couple of days and it was a couple of days too 
many marsh said 
if the polar star is to escape to the east a decision will have 
to be made soon he said before that route also freezes in 
the polar star wintered over in 1981 in the arctic and it could 
again said marsh most of its 140member crew would be shipped 
south to wait 
but if the polar star is out of service over the winter he 
said it could not be used as backup to its sister ship the polar 
sea the polar sea leaves seattle in a few weeks for the antarctic

when soviets set their clocks ahead 
next spring for an extra hour of daylight estonia wont switch 
with them 
the tiny baltic republic will no longer tick to the time in 
moscow 500 miles to the south but to the time in finland 50 
miles to the north 
thus even the clocks will reflect the new spirit of 
independence among estonians 
long viewed as one of the most progressive of the 15 soviet 
republics estonia is trying in many other ways to set its own 
course its leaders hope to use their independence to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of president mikhail s gorbachevs social and 
economic reforms 
with the blessing of the republics communist party officials 
are planning to open trade offices abroad enter joint ventures 
with western companies without moscow approval return to family 
farming and even issue their own currency that unlike the ruble 
could be traded on world markets 
the communist party of estonia can be regarded as one of the 
frontrankers of the reconstruction drive estonia has been the 
initiator of many reforms said estonian party chief vaijno 
vyalyas 
vyalyas a gorbachev protege appears to have his blessing but 
he and the estonian activists leading the reform drive have been 
careful not to go too far as they say the armenians have done in 
their campaign for annexation of a region in the republic of 
azerbaijan 
at the bottom of our hearts all estonians want secession 
said ulo kaevats head of the auditing commission of the peoples 
front a grassroots organization pushing for reform but if we 
did put forward this question we would have martial law and we 
all know that very well 
marju lauristin a journalism professor who helped found the 
peoples front also argues against extremism citing the 
armenians troubled campaign as a lesson 
if we demand only maximalist ends we will get nothing 
lauristin 48 said in an interview 
the selfrestraint seems to be paying off for the peoples front 
the groups blue red and green emblem can be seen on posters 
flags and buttons throughout tallinn estonias ancient seaside 
capital staterun radio broadcast the fronts organizing 
conference live oct 12 and newspapers reported it on their front 
pages 
even in moscow the centrally controlled press which has 
branded other such groups as antisocialist carried generally 
sympathetic reports on the peoples front 
the group which formed in april and claims a membership of 
60000 in estonia approved a platform at its conference that in 
effect calls for estonia to establish its autonomy from moscow in 
all matters except defense and foreign policy 
the peoples front demanded decolonization and seeks local 
control of agriculture industry and businesses without 
interference from moscow the group also wants estonian to be the 
republics official language and proposes curbs on the settlement 
of nonestonians who make up 40 percent of the republics 
population 
the group also is after political power it has fielded 
candidates in local elections and plans to put up more in 
legislative elections next spring 
so far however it has been careful not to challenge the 
communist party directly 
about 28 percent of its members also belong to the party and 
vyalyas the partys estonian first secretary sat through most of 
the fronts organizational congress lending it a measure of 
official backing 
in a sept 9 speech vyalyas told the estonian partys central 
committee that he endorsed the fronts demands for economic 
selfmanagement restoration of historical truth creation of 
estonian citizenship and preservation of estonians as the ethnic 
majority in the republic 
to compensate for what it calls a mistake of history the 
peoples front wants moscow to renounce the 1939 nonaggression 
pact with germany that led to the soviet takeover of estonia and 
the other baltic states of lithuania and latvia unlike a smaller 
citizens group called the estonian independence party however 
the peoples front does not call for a return of estonian 
sovereignty 
giving estonia a measure of independence is not without risk 
the soviet union has more than 100 nationalities and ethnic groups 
all with their own concerns the central government must perform a 
constant balancing act showing tolerance for national and ethnic 
goals while holding the union together 
the experiments could reap rich rewards for the republic if 
estonian agricultural production increases if foreign trade grows 
and if consumer goods appear in stores but they also could benefit 
gorbachev who is trying to prove to conservatives that giving 
soviets more responsibility and incentives will improve life more 
than the methods of central planning he blames for years of 
stagnation and political repression 
estonia with a population of 15 million seems wellsuited as 
a proving ground for perestroika it had experience deciding 
matters for itself during 22 years of independence between the two 
world wars and many estonians have been watching the prosperity of 
their neighbors and linguistic cousins the finns while their own 
growth was stifled under soviet control 
estonians receive daily exposure to capitalism by watching 
finnish tv and the results are apparent in fashions on display in 
tallinn shops 
but while estonians enjoy some western pleasures they are 
reminded constantly that they are still part of the soviet union 
even as jazz musician lembit saarsalu sat in the living room of 
his tallinn apartment watching the cosby show on finnish tv he 
pulled out a white slip of paper 
it was the latest in a series of rejection slips on his 
application for a telephone hes been trying to get one for 10 
years

the human rights now rock tour 
filled this west african nations national stadium for ninehour 
concert that ended early monday 
sting bruce springsteen tracy chapman and other stars 
performed under hazy tropical skies in a concert whose aim was to 
celebrate the 40th anniversary of the universal declaration of 
human rights 
more than 30000 people filled the stadium many of them 
dancing waving and singing on the grass as hundreds of fruit bats 
circled overhead 
sting asked at a preconcert news conference what hope he had 
of persuading dictators to democratize said the dictator is not 
our target the dictator doesnt listen to our records he doesnt 
know our faces he doesnt care 
our target are his children and his grandchildren and his 
grandchildrens friends maybe his mistress people who will 
inherit the political infrastructures of the countries we visit i 
think there are more young people than old people in the world 
today we have a great deal of influence with that constituency 
and 10 15 years from now we hope that the seed we plant when we 
come to a country will bear fruit in a very real way in a very 
pragmatic honest way when these people achieve real power 
springsteen recalling the previous stop in zimbabwe on the 
20city concert tour noted that he plays to mostly white audiences 
in the united states i had a chance in harare for the first 
time to really play to an integrated audience 
and for me it was one of the most important concerts of my 
life there was a moment towards the end of the night when i ask 
everyone to raise their hands and looking out and seeing the black 
hands raised with the white hands was a very emotional moment for 
me 
because i think when that happens when black hands and white 
hands are raised together and when rich hands and poor hands and 
when hands from the east and hands from the west that is when 
governments tremble and thats the day they will pay more attention 
to the articles of this document 
other artists on the tour whose next stop was sao paulo 
brazil included peter gabriel johnny clegg and his group savuka

a judge today dismissed federal 
hostagetaking charges against indian activist timothy jacobs but 
said he would leave it to a jury to decide whether his fellow 
defendant was guilty on that charge 
four other charges against jacobs still stood 
attorneys for jacobs on friday had argued that prosecutors had 
failed to prove that he and eddie hatcher had made a demand on the 
federal government during their takeover of the robesonian 
newspaper in lumberton on feb 1 
us district court judge terrence boyle said this morning that 
his reading of the statute showed that a demand on the government 
had to be not just incidental but material 
up to 20 people were held hostage in the newspaper office for as 
much as 10 hours while the two defendants demanded an investigation 
into what they said was local corruption and racial discrimination 
no one was injured 
boyle said prosecutors had presented no evidence that jacobs had 
made a demand or had aided hatcher in making a demand to the 
federal government in hatchers case though he said the jury 
should decide the question testimony had indicated that hatcher 
did most of the talking during the incident 
the hostagetaking charge was linked with a second charge of 
committing a violent crime with an illegal firearm boyle also 
dismissed that charge against jacobs 
jacobs still faces charges of conspiracy making an illegal 
firearm possessing an unregistered firearm and conveying false 
information concerning explosives 
in his ruling today boyle also indicated he would not accept a 
necessity defense for the two defendants because there was no 
direct relationship between the hostages taken at the robesonian 
and the threats perceived by the two 
the two defendants had argued that their lives were in jeopardy 
because of information they had allegedly linking law enforcement 
officers to drug trafficking in robeson county they claimed they 
had no choice but to take hostages at the newspaper to publicize 
their case and save their lives 
last week defense attorney lewis pitts had argued for dismissal 
of the hostage charge against jacobs saying that there is 
absolutely no proof as to timmy jacobs making a demand on the 
federal government 
pitts argued that the federal hostagetaking law was designed to 
deal with international seizures and that congress had specifically 
wanted strict limits on its use in domestic cases 
what may have been done may have been conspicuously a crime 
but the question is whether its a criminal matter against the 
united states boyle had said friday 
it appears we have here a situation that the evidence appears 
to show was a locally generated grievance boyle said it arose 
in robeson county and it had to do with matters in robeson county 
the demand on the federal government arose from a demand for 
state action a special prosecutor which state law apparently 
did not allow 
the federal prosecutor assistant us attorney john bruce had 
argued that the federal charges were relevant because the two asked 
to surrender to fbi agents and included in their written list of 
demands a requirement for a federal investigation in robeson county

its electionyear antennae in full working 
order congress is aiming to finish fashioning a 
somethingforeveryone antidrug bill and a 27 billion tax 
measure this week and then adjourn for the year 
both measures would satisfy a compelling urge that overtakes 
lawmakers each election year to churn out legislation popular with 
large numbers of voters 
work on both however is being influenced by another instinct 
that becomes unusually potent on capitol hill late in evennumbered 
years the desire to flee washington in time to campaign for 
reelection 
thus when the senate turns to the drug measure possibly on 
wednesday legislators will be struggling to finish their work 
quickly or going home with no bill at all 
ninetyfive percent of the good well do with this bill is in 
the core bill insists one of the sponsors of the drug 
legislation sen sam nunn dga if members from both sides 
continue to insist on the more controversial amendments we wont 
get a bill 
the drug bill is a twoyear 26 billion collection of programs 
ranging from an expansion of the availability of treatment programs 
to a stiffening of penalties for people convicted of distributing 
drugs to children 
but lawmakers are lining up to offer an assortment of amendments 
that are so contentious that the bill just might be debated to 
death 
senators and their aides spent the long columbus day weekend 
trying to figure out how to slash the number of amendments the 
chamber will have to sort through with republicans ready to offer 
six to 10 amendments and democrats poised to introduce more than 70 
others 
among the more controversial amendments are proposals to allow 
courts to consider illegally gathered evidence that police obtained 
in good faith narrow the rights of prisoners to claim they were 
jailed illegally require a waiting period for people wishing to 
purchase handguns and apply tougher sanctions against the apartheid 
government of south africa 
an effort may be made to strip from the bill a provision that 
would allow capital punishment for drug dealers who order killings 
for hired killers who commit murder as part of a drug enterprise 
and for anyone who kills a law enforcement officer during the 
commission of a drug crime 
one matter the measure skirts is where the money will come from 
for the very programs the bill would create 
although 14 billion of the legislations spending would be 
expected to occur over the next 12 months lawmakers say the 
government right now can only scrape together 450 million the 
senate has so far voted down efforts to raise some taxes and to cut 
other federal programs to provide the extra money 
even if the senate finishes its work the house and senate will 
have to agree on an identical bill before they can send it to 
president reagan for his signature the house passed a drug measure 
on sept 22 that provides the government with tough weapons against 
drug dealers and users including the death penalty 
before the senate gets to the drug bill however it will have 
to finish work on the catchall tax legislation 
the senate is ready to resume debate tuesday on the measure 
which would extend expiring tax benefits to firsttime homebuyers 
and companies that increase research spending it would also 
provide benefits to farmers and freelance artists and writers 
the bill would require the internal revenue service to fully 
inform people who are being audited of their rights and it would 
require the government to purchase 540 acres of land that was the 
site of the second battle of bull run in manassas va in order to 
block construction of a shopping mall

seven months of bad weather mosquitoes 
and fear of living alone on the streets havent halted jacqueline 
smiths stubborn sidewalk protest outside the small motel where 
martin luther king jr died 
ill be here for as long as it takes she said standing 
beside a makeshift plastic tent that serves as her living quarters 
outside the lorraine motel where king was assassinated 20 yuears 
ago 
miss smith 37 was evicted from the motel by sheriffs deputies 
on march 2 
a resident of the lorraine since 1972 she refused to leave when 
the crumbling motel was closed last january to eventually become 
the centerpiece of a civil rights museum 
ive been maintaining i dont have any complaints miss 
smith said last week i knew this wouldnt be easy 
she sleeps on a reclining lawn chair covered by sheets and 
plastic and preaches to all who will listen that the museum is part 
of a conspiracy to gentrify her downtown neighborhood 
what theyre trying to do is force the black people out and 
theyre using the lorraine as a focus she said 
the area of the lorraine made up largely of warehouses and 
rundown rental housing was designated a historic district in 1982 
and developers have launched several renovation projects there for 
apartments condominiums and offices 
theyre using the lorraine motel to get this land theyre not 
fooling anybody miss smith said 
the lorraine belongs to the people she said and should be 
used as housing for the homeless or for some other public purpose 
while hesitant to talk about her life on the street she said 
her food is supplied by friends and supporters who also donate 
money from time to time she has toilet privileges at a nearby 
apartment and she said a security guard has kept her company at 
night for part of her vigil 
the majority of the time im here alone but i have great 
moral and spiritual support she said 
a folding table beside her tent held several large pictures of 
king a jar for donations and a notebook for visitors to sign 
three scraggly potted plants offered the only softening to the 
concrete scene 
every now and then there are people who come by and scream 
things out of their cars but they pass so fast i cant even 
understand what theyre saying miss smith said 
once she said a street person hit her with his fist for some 
unknown reason 
a rainy cold wave struck shortly after her vigil began and 
temperatures during the summer topped 100 degrees insect repellant 
used to combat mosquitoes caused a rash on her arms and hands 
darmy bailey a principal supporter of the museum said he has 
failed to convince miss smith that the project will be a monument 
to king 
there doesnt seem to be any rational logical tone to her 
perception of things bailey said 
part of the motel will be razed but the wing where king was 
killed will be restored and will be at the heart of the museum 
construction will begin in about three months bailey said and the 
museum should be finished in 1991

onetwentieth of what it was only five years ago 
gulf coast officials say erratic weather patterns and pollution 
have combined to devastate the local oyster reefs this seasons 
harvest is expected to be fewer than 20000 sacks compared with 
the 365560 sacks taken in 1983 
each year its getting worse and worse said kirk ladner 
whose business terrys seafood in waveland buys oysters from 17 
boats 
ladner said because of the limited oyster population in 
mississippi waters and because the commercial dredging limit has 
been lowered to 10 sacks per day many oystermen will likely head 
for louisiana waters where they can take 30 sacks a day 
however ladner said mississippi oysters are in demand because a 
sack of them produces twice as much meat as a sack of any other 
kind 
marshes once protected oysters in the mississippi sound by 
acting as a natural buffer between salt water and fresh water 
barge canals through marshes and the channelization of rivers and 
bayous has sent flood waters directly into the sound these sudden 
pulses of fresh water kill oysters 
in 1983 flood waters rushed through the bonnet carre spillway 
and into the mississippi sound destroying nearly 4000 acres of 
oyster reefs in 1986 a drought left the sound saltier which made 
conditions ripe for snails called oyster drills to wipe out the 
harvest 
while clam shells have been planted in the mississippi sound 
this year to provide a base for young oysters to grow on many feel 
the salvation of the oyster industry is four years away a proposed 
62 million spillway along the bonnet carre spillway could allow a 
regulated flow of fresh water into the mississippi sound 
if estimates are correct this us army corps of engineers 
project could increase oyster production to 38 million pounds a 
year by restoring the flow of fresh water through the marshes of 
louisiana and into the mississippi sound 
but even with this freshwater regulator droughts floods and 
pollution could continue to kill oysters 
basically i believe youre talking mother nature said john 
cirino a biotechnician at gulf coast research laboratory cirino 
is coordinating the bureau of marine resources bmr shellfish 
program 
in the last 10 years weve had three major floods and three 
years of high salinity and in between three years of good 
production he said

rebels in southern sudan today claimed 
they killed 62 government soldiers and captured a small town during 
a threeday battle 
the clandestine radio of the sudan peoples liberation army said 
in a report monitored in nairobi that 300 soldiers fled to nearby 
uganda when its guerillas captured ikotos town in eastern 
equatorial province on friday 
spla fighters have taken positions on the sudanese side but 
because of the respect we have for international borders we cannot 
cross into uganda the radio said we urge the fugitives to 
surrender if they surrender without their arms no harm will be 
done to them 
the radio made no mention of rebel casualties and it was not 
possible to independently verify its report 
the sudan peoples liberation army took up arms in 1983 against 
the moslemdominated government in khartoum demanding more 
autonomy for the mainly christian and animist south the rebel 
movement claims control of 90 percent of the southern countryside 
and small towns 
thousands of civilians fleeing the war and the food shortages it 
has caused have headed to larger towns such as juba or to northern 
sudan but relief officials say many have starved to death on the 
way

czechoslovak premier lubomir 
strougal who headed the federal government for more than 18 years 
and slovak premier peter colotka resigned today the state news 
agency ctk reported 
the announcement was made by communist party chief milos jakes 
in a speech at a plenary session of the partys central committee 
he said the resignations were accepted 
strougal believed to be the longestserving premier in europe 
replaced oldrich cernik in january 1970 
colotka has served as slovak premier since may 1969 and as 
czechoslovak deputy premier since september 1969 
czechoslovakia consists of two republics of equal rights the 
czech socialist republic and the slovak socialist republic 
each is governed by a national council which delegates to an 
overall federal assembly responsibility for constitutional and 
foreign affairs defense and important economic decisions 
the primary source of power in czechoslovakia is the communist 
party 
the shakeup in czechoslovakia follows similar government 
reorganizations in the soviet union hungary and poland 
in his speech jakes also said changes were made in the 
topruling politburo the party secretariat the central committee 
itself and federal czech and slovak governments however he did 
not name the effected officials 
jakes was quoted as saying the proposed changes proceed from 
the need for a new deployment of leading cadres in the intereest of 
mastering the demanding tasks of economic and social 
restructuring 
there have long been rumors about toplevel changes in 
czechoslovakia and jakes and other officials indicated for some 
time that younger people would be promoted to senior positions 
in remarks winding up a twoday session of the central committee 
on april 9 jakes said the leadership wanted to elevate younger 
comrades and thus create conditions for further successful 
fulfillment of party tasks 
he then also said it was an important requirement to ensure 
that qualified young people are more frequently proposed for key 
economic and other jobs 
at todays meeting opening a twoday plenary session on 
ideology jakes also proposed that the next party congress be moved 
forward by one year and take place in 1990 
jakes also made clear that unlike in neighboring hungary 
independent human rights ecological and other groups would not be 
allowed to operate 
he warned that formation and operation of antisocialist 
political structures will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted 
the meeting was called a week after the communist partys ruling 
presidium or politburo met wednesday to discuss personnel changes 
amid speculation that politburo member vasil bilak who has long 
held the key ideology portfolio may also retire 
a fellow ideologist jan fojtik was promoted to the ruling 
politburo in april and has appeared increasingly to oversee the 
important function 
fojtiks promotion was one of the few changes made in 
czechoslovakias top leadership since milos jakes replaced 
president gustav husak as communist party leader in december 
the ctk news agency earlier reported the meeting would discuss 
an evaluation of conclusions from two recent party sessions and 
the tasks of ideological work of the party in the conditions of 
restructuring 
in a highly surprising article carried by the party daily rude 
pravo last week a senior party official called for resolute 
condemnation of egocentrism the wish to stand at the head of the 
party as long as possible and thus to prevent the younger 
generation from enganging in decisionmaking 
rudolf hegenbart who heads a central committee department 
responsible for state administration demanded accountability of 
all leading cadres and more personal courage in admitting that i 
am no longer able to carry on the entrusted office 
most czechoslovak leaders are well into their sixties and some 
such as president husak and federal assembly parliament president 
alois indra were known to be ailing or gravely ill 
the working people want to elect representatives whom they 
trust and not those who twist and turn like a weather wane when the 
socalled new wind starts to blow or those who bear 
responsibility for having brought the economy and other social 
sectors into critical situations and yet call today for new 
principles of management hegenbart told rude pravo

the army opened fire with machineguns on 
demonstrators in western algiers today killing at least 25 people 
and wounding dozens more witnesses said 
the gunfire occurred in babeloued a district in western 
algiers as 10000 people responded to a call by the islamic 
fundamentalists for a peaceful march of protest 
an islamic group said more than 250 people have died in weeklong 
antigovernment protests against high prices and the economic 
policies of president chadli bendjedid 
there were bodies lying on all sides one witness at 
babeloued reported the soldiers were piling them into trucks 
one body on top of another 
the witness and others reported several dozen people were 
injured and taken away in ambulances they spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
one participant reported seeing the body of a teenager wrapped 
in a sheet and taken away by friends other witnesses spoke of at 
least 25 and perhaps 30 dead in the latest outbreak of violence 
no official death toll has been issued in the riots the worst 
in this north african nation since its independence from france in 
1962 
the movement for algerian renewal an islamic fundamentalist 
group that claims to lead the demonstrations reported 256 dead 
since tuesday and 600 injured hospital and police sources have 
said about 200 have died with several hundred wounded 
bendjedid prepared to address the nation tonight about the 
crisis 
the army fired volleys of machinegun fire into the air today to 
disperse the march from belcourt three miles to the east of 
babeloued which violated regulations under the state of 
emergency declared thursday 
the demonstrators split up and many went to babeloued where 
troops fired into the crowd according to witnesses 
riots also have occurred in the western port city of oran to 
annaba in the east and a dozen provincial centers said interior 
minister el hadi khediri appearing on state television over the 
weekend 
we have tried in vain to stop the troubles khediri said 
earlier today the city of algiers was calm most shops reopened 
in downtown algiers and traffic moved troops and tanks were posted 
at main intersections and at the harbor 
clashes between the army and rioters spread late saturday and 
early sunday in algiers as protesters defied a 10 pm to 6 am 
curfew and a ban on demonstrations 
kouba on the southern fringes of algiers apparently suffered 
the largest number of dead and injured hospital sources reported 
more than 60 people killed when the army according to witnesses 
fired into a crowd after it repeatedly ignored calls to disperse 
unrest began about 10 days ago with nonviolent strikes 
demanding higher wages to keep up with inflation 
algerias annual unemployment rate is estimated at 40 percent 
and food prices have risen by at least 40 percent since january 
but the government has vowed to stick to an austerity plan prompted 
in part by the falling price of oil the nations main export 
at mustapha hospital in algiers physicians moved patients out 
of the hospital to make room for the hundreds of injured 
demonstrators 
its terrible beirut like beirut the same thing said a 
french citizen arriving sunday in paris on air algerias only 
scheduled flight of the day he was interviewed on french 
television he was not identified 
the islamic movement on sunday demanded removal of the 
president interior minister khediri and the head of the ruling 
national liberation front party mohamed cherif messaadia 
the movement came to public attention saturday when it demanded 
cheaper food and the dismantling of the political apparatus

negotiators have moved closer to an agreement 
to withdraw 50000 cuban troops from angola over 24 to 30 months in 
a tradeoff for south africa granting independence to neighboring 
namibia us officials said monday 
the gap has been substantially narrowed an official told 
the associated press 
while no final deal was struck in weekend talks in new york 
cuban officials suggested they were willing to step up the pace of 
withdrawal from the 2000 a month they had proposed said the 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
south africa had demanded that 8000 a month quit angola where 
the cubans are helping a sovietbacked government defend itself 
against guerrillas armed by the united states and south africa 
the cuban officials also indicated they were willing to step up 
the pace of withdrawing the 16000 to 18000 troops stationed near 
the border with namibia or southwest africa the us sources 
said 
the twin issues have been major sticking points in working out a 
settlement 
but the us officials said negotiators would have to meet again 
and that further significant decisions will be required before 
a final agreement was concluded 
the talks were held over the weekend and involved officials from 
angola cuba south africa and the united states 
there already was a tentative understanding that the cuban 
troops would withdraw over 24 to 30 months some trainers will 
remain behind to assist the angolan forces fight the guerrillas 
however the question was whether the withdrawal would be 
frontendloaded a sizable pullout in the early stages to 
make the retreat irreversible and how quickly the troops near the 
namibian border would leave 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said further 
talks would be held soon but that it may not be possible to reach 
the nov 1 deadline set by the united nations for transition to 
independence for namibia 
in johannesburg roland darroll a foreign affairs spokesman 
said south africa cuba and angola had agreed that cuban troops 
should be withdrawn from angola within 24 to 30 months 
that was the agreement in brazzaville congo it was subject 
to consultation with the governments darroll said 
he said he had no further information 
south africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with a 
oneyear independence plan for namibia which it rules to the 
withdrawal of the cuban troops the pretoria government pulled its 
soldiers out of namibia earlier this year and says cubas forces 
threaten the territorys independence 
diplomats involved in the talks had said they were working 
toward reaching agreement on a cuban withdrawal timetable at a 
formal meeting to be held sometime later this month in congo 
that meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are running 
out of time to achieve a compromise before nov 1 south africa has 
suggested that date for putting into effect the uns independence 
plan for namibia

four years after the irish republican army blew up 
her seaside convention hotel margaret thatcher and her 
conservative party reassembled monday in the same place with the 
political fundamentals unchanged 
arriving in brighton on the eve of the fourday convention mrs 
thatcher gazed at the repaired facade of the grand hotel and said 
her strongest memory from the oct 12 1984 bombing was that the 
day after the convention started on time and people flooded in 
they werent going to be defeated 
the ira in a statement to the irish media said it takes 
great delight from the hysteria and the expense surrounding the 
security of mrs thatcher and the tories at their brighton 
conference 
the british leader and the ira remain pledged to wiping each 
other out she is britains longest continuously serving prime 
minister this century while the iras bombandbullet campaign to 
drive britain out of northern ireland has become one of the longest 
onandoff wars of the century 
mrs thatcher said she chose to return to the graceful old 
victorian hotel because after the incident last time we could not 
possibly have stayed anywhere else 
so far this year 81 people have been killed in northern 
ireland compared with 93 in 1987 and a new ira campaign against 
british servicemen has cost five lives in england and continental 
europe this year 
what has changed irrevocably is the atmosphere of british 
political party conventions since the bomb ripped through the 
eightstory grand hotel in the south england resort five people 
were killed and 30 injured 
mrs thatcher emerged unscathed having left the bathroom of her 
suite two minutes before falling masonry demolished it today we 
were unlucky said an ira statement but remember we have only 
to be lucky once you will always have to be lucky 
terrorism will never win riposted mrs thatcher 
until the bombing tory party conventions were relaxed affairs 
reporters delegates lobbyists and bystanders rubbed shoulders 
with cabinet ministers in lobbies and bars guards at the entrances 
merely glanced at identity badges 
as the tories returned for the first time since 1984 however 
more than 2000 police have been mobilized to provide security 
sidewalks mail boxes and sewers around the hotel and adjacent 
conference center are sealed off overflights by civil aircraft are 
banned and a royal navy destroyer patrols offshore 
in a 26 million operation codenamed radcot bomb experts and 
dogs have scoured the grand hotel where mrs thatcher and many of 
her 22member cabinet are staying again for the fourday conference 
police have checked more than 50000 brighton hotel guests 
staff and residents 
we assess the level of risk quite clearly as very high 
said sussex county police chief constable roger birch 
but richard ingrams a columnist in the liberal observer 
newspaper wrote this expensive farce is a great tribute to the 
ira he said the security measures were so extreme and so alien 
to our way of life that it is worth wondering whether in fact 
terrorism has not already won 
the ira statement recalled that mrs thatcher was saying seven 
years ago that the ira was finished and added the british 
public can now judge for themselves how safe their prime minister 
feels when she has to surround herself with the royal navy the 
royal air force the special air services the special boat 
service the british army and a police force 
the bomb killed lawmaker sir anthony berry lancashire tory area 
director eric taylor jean shattock wife of another regional 
official roberta wakeham wife of the parliamentary chief whip 
and muriel maclean wife of the president of the scottish 
conservative association 
it also indirectly cost mrs thatcher one of her closest cabinet 
allies norman tebbit who had to quit active politics and go into 
business in order to pay for the care of his wife margaret who 
was paralyzed for life by the explosion 
tebbit was trade and industry secretary at the time of the 
bombing and then party chairman before resigning this year 
patrick magee the ira man who is serving a life sentence for 
the five murders planted the 20 to 30pound timebomb behind the 
wall panels of a bedroom four floors above mrs thatchers suite 
magee checked into the grand hotel under a false name a month 
before the convention and was traced after police painstakingly 
combed the hotels register and questioned hundreds of previous 
guests 
mrs thatcher who turns 63 on thursday was elected in 1979 and 
won an unprecedented third consecutive term last year 
unlike the opposition labor party which ended its convention 
last week deeply divided over how to reverse its repeated defeats 
the tories look more united than ever before 
also unlike labor the tories do not make policy at their 
conventions and this years gathering is expected simply to 
endorse a continuation of mrs thatchers freemarket economics 
hawkish foreign policy and tough stance on law and order 
the conservatives command 45 percent support in opinion polls 
five points ahead of labor and mrs thatcher remains the choice of 
61 percent of britons as the most effective leader on offer

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis bidding for the support of young middle class voters 
proposed monday allowing firsttime home buyers to use up to 
10000 of their iras for a down payment 
while outlining his housing proposal dukakis also sounded an 
optimistic note in the face of polls showing him trailing 
republican george bush he told a partisan crowd at gen douglas 
macarthur high school this one is out there to be won you know 
it and i know it 
we can taste it we can feel it 
dukakis spoke in one of the communities that came to symbolize 
the postworld war ii homebuilding boom and recalled bipartisan 
efforts to promise to provide affordable housing for all 
americans 
he said the reagan administration broke that promise in the 
early 1980s 
from levittown dukakis went to midtown manhattan to march in 
the annual columbus day parade 
with new york gov mario cuomo at his side and mayor edward koch 
just behind him dukakis walked up fifth avenue on a clear cool day 
to the cheers of a largely friendly crowd 
john f kennedy jr who was on crutches after breaking his foot 
in a bicycling accident marched part of the way with dukakis 
red white and blue dukakisbentsen signs lined the route 
punctuated only rarely by bush placards 
while dukakis appeared to have the parade crowd on his side 
bush received the endorsement of il progresso the nations largest 
italian language daily newspaper 
bush supporters passed out copies of the newspaper which said 
the traditional values of italianamericans can be found in the 
electoral program of vice president bush 
after the parade dukakis was returning to boston to resume 
preparations for his second and last debate with bush 
im looking forward very very much to that debate on thursday 
night he told the audience at the gen douglas macarthur high 
school 
this is a tight race folks and its getting tighter every 
day he said then in a reference to the vice presidential 
debate between his running mate lloyd bentsen and the republican 
nominee dan quayle dukakis said and the events of the last week 
have tightened it up some more 
as usual he laced his speech with disparaging references to 
quayle 
george bush and his friends are satisfied he said they 
say all is well they believe dan quayle is the only cloud on their 
horizon dan quayle is more than just a cloud hes a major storm 
system this is one storm the american people can avoid 
dukakis dubbed his housing proposal home start and said it 
was aimed at giving families a chance to buy their first home a 
start on the ladder of opportunity and security that homeownership 
represents 
he said it was a simple solution no new bureaucracies no red 
tape whyat it will do is permit firsttime homebuyers to invest 
their ira savings or their taxdeferred pension plans to make 
downpayments on their homes 
myles lynk a dukakis adviser who worked on formulating the 
proposal said there would be a 10000 cap on the amount that 
could be withdrawn from individual retirement accounts 
we dont want to create an incentive to liquidate iras he 
said 
in addition dukakis would reduce the down payment required for 
federally insured mortgages 
lynk said the principal cost of the home ownership plan would be 
the estimated 400 million loss in tax revenue resulting from the 
increased incentive for people to contribute to individual 
retirement accounts

the numbers that pentagon planners had been 
crunching led them to predict that if more high school graduates 
enlisted in the allvolunteer armed forces fewer would drop out 
before completing their service 
so they were a little surprised to find that starting in 1979 
although more recruits had high school diplomas more of them were 
dropping out 
defense department officials have already implemented one 
solution telling drill sergeants to ease up on recruits at boot 
camp and they are preparing a detailed questionnaire to be 
introduced as early as next october that they hope will enable 
them to forecast more accurately the type of recruit most likely to 
persevere 
according to analysis by the defense department and the rand 
corp the tale begins with a pay raise that had the desired result 
of attracting more people into the armed forces said steven 
sellman director of accession policy in the pentagons personnel 
policy office 
the surge in recruits caused a change in the attitudes of 
trainers at boot camps he said 
in 1980 the number of recruits went up trainers in the boot 
camps thought there are a lot of people queuing up wanting to 
get in so sensitivity was low to the problems of enlistees 
said sellman 
in the 1980s there was not the same kind of sensitivity to 
people as in the 1970s when recruitment was low and boot camp 
trainers were willing to counsel recruits who were having problems 
he said 
the word went out to the boot camps to lighten up and the 
dropout rate dropped 
the pentagon wants to retain welleducated recruits because 
training processing and replacing each dropout costs 18000 
sellman said in an interview 
so reducing the dropout rate even by 1 percent can mean big 
bucks he said 
pentagon officials also want to assure a steady flow of 
welleducated recruits to handle the increasingly sophisticated 
weaponry of the hightechnology battlefield 
a rand report written by richard buddin found that from the 
beginning of fiscal 1980 through the end of 1983 the percentage 
of highquality recruits rose from 28 percent to 49 percent for 
men and from 33 percent to 66 percent for women but the sixmonth 
attrition rate also rose 09 and 15 percentage points for men and 
women 
for the army rand found the sixmonth attrition rate for men 
rose from 66 percent in fiscal 1979 to 109 percent in fiscal 1985 
after new policies were introduced providing greater counseling 
for troubled recruits the attrition rates went back down to 72 
percent 
attrition rates for highquality recruits vary from base to 
base with the highest levels consistently at fort jackson next to 
columbia sc and the lowest at fort bliss near el paso texas 
and fort mcclellan near anniston ala 
despite the improvements said sellman we are still dabbling 
with the recruitment profile that includes asking rand to review 
the records of thousands of recruits to determine why they dropped 
out 
at the same time sellman and his associates are working on a 
long questionnaire they hope will give them a better handle on the 
kinds of people likely to fulfill their service contracts 
the questions ask potential recruits about such issues as 
previous work trouble with authorities drug or alcohol use 
problems in high school grades and the types of courses taken 
people in academic programs tend to have a little more 
sticktoitness than people who followed a vocational program 
said sellman 
the answers will be compared to those given by earlier recruits 
who finished their enlistment he said the questionnaires which 
will take about 30 minutes to fill out may be introduced by 
october 1989 
introducing the questionnaire will add an additional index to 
the two the armed forces have used since the beginning of the 
allvolunteer force to measure the quality of recruits whether 
they received a high school diploma and how they scored on the 
armed forces qualification test 
previously said sellman the biggest predictor has been the 
high school degree recruits with high school degrees are twice as 
likely to make it

authorities have frozen two foreign bank accounts 
belonging to a fugitive financial planner who was captured in 
japan spurring hopes that clients may be able to recover some of 
the 20 million reported missing 
courtappointed receiver james feltman said monday he filed 
lawsuits freezing henry ghermans bank accounts in two countries 
the miami accountant said investigators were preparing to freeze a 
third foreign account 
feltman said the freezing of the accounts increases the 
likelihood that a substantial amount of the missing money will be 
recovered and allen said ghermans arrest over the weekend will 
only help the case 
both feltman and his attorney richard allen refused to 
identify the countries where ghermans accounts were found but 
they said the countries are known for strict banking secrecy laws 
details of ghermans financial arrangements could alert the 
money managers associates fletman and allen said and allow them 
to empty the accounts before pending court actions are resolved 
the fbi announced saturday gherman had been arrested in tokyo 
gherman was sought on federal charges filed aug 29 of mail 
fraud and embezzlement he fled miami two weeks earlier leaving 
notes of apology to his bilked investment clients 
up to 50 miamiarea investors including several doctors and 
nurses may have lost as much as 20 million through gherman over 
the past decade 
feltman said the accounts frozen could hold anywhere from 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars 
but nothing has been verified he said we dont know 
exactly how much because of the banking secrecy laws in those 
countries and thats making this stage of our investigation a very 
thorny and delicate process 
gherman is being held at tokyos kosugi prison in a detention 
center for foreign prisoners he is expected to face a preliminary 
extradition hearing later this week according to fbi spokesman 
paul miller 
feltman said japanese authorities have been asked if gherman is 
willing to cooperate in the investigation but have not responded 
yet 
miller said gherman first arrived in taipei taiwan on a 
legitimate visa in his own name 11 days after fleeing florida he 
subsequently registered at two taipei hotels under his own name and 
made numerous intercontinental telephone calls to the united states 
using his own name after us authorities located him they 
arranged for his expulsion to japan 
feltman said the foreign bank accounts were traced through 
records gherman left at his north miami beach offices and through a 
series of financial transactions the financial planner made before 
his disappearance in august

a man who claimed he found a mouse in 
a can of coors beer pleaded innocent monday to charges of extortion 
and tampering 
james n harvey 30 was charged sept 27 with a state law that 
prohibits tampering with consumer products and with extortion for 
asking representatives of the adolph coors co for 35000 in 
exchange for the can of beer and the mouse 
he remained free on bond and a pretrial hearing was scheduled 
for friday if convicted of both counts harvey could face up to 30 
years in prison 
harvey a construction worker claimed he purchased a can of 
coors on july 27 and discovered a mouse after taking a few swallows 
on july 29 harvey called the coors consumer hot line and 
reported finding the rodent coors initially offered to pay 1500 
for the mouse and the can but he refused and later asked for 
35000 
a judge later ordered harvey to turn over both the mouse and the 
can for testing 
a university of florida pathologist determined that based on 
the amount of decomposition the rodent could not have been in the 
can when it was packaged on may 13 that conclusion however was 
disputed by a pathologist hired by gary pajcic an attorney 
representing harvey at the time 
harvey is charged with violating the state statute of consumer 
product tampering enacted in 1987 following cases involving 
painreliever capsules including tylenol said assistant state 
attorney e mcrae mathis 
the statute carries a maximum sentence of 15 years and a 5000 
fine the extortion count also carries a 15year prison term 
coors has sued harvey claiming that he defamed the companys 
product and attempted to defraud the company 
coors based in golden colo claims it has spent 500000 
defending its reputation as a result of the adverse publicity and 
the local coors distributor neal tyler and sons inc said it has 
lost 100000 in sales

the inter american press association has 
sent a formal protest to chilean president augusto pinochet 
condemning police attacks on reporters covering antigovernment 
demonstrations 
the note sent sunday said iapa is shocked and outraged by 
the brutal attacks on journalists last thursday friday and 
saturday following the presidential plebiscite in your country 
the message was signed by iapa president ignacio e lozano jr 
and wilbur g landrey chairman of the freedom of press and 
information committee 
it is difficult to believe that these attacks were isolated 
spontaneous actions especially in the circumstances in which they 
took place at a time when chileans had just voted their 
preferences the statement said 
pinochet had just lost an election in which the people voted 
whether they wanted him to continue as president for another 
eightyear term 
at its salt lake meeting iapa is compiling a countrybycountry

a judge on monday ordered cbs records to turn 
over the master tape of the rock group judas priests stained 
class album so it can be examined for subliminal messages that 
may have prompted two teenagers to enter into a suicide pact 
cbs has not been completely cooperating with discovery in this 
case washoe district court judge jerry whitehead said before 
delaying trial of a lawsuit against the group and giving the 
company 30 days to hand over the master tape 
cbs has told plaintiffs in the lawsuit it cannot find the 
24track master tape for the 1978 album the judge said the tape 
would be a key piece of evidence in separating sounds among the 
music and lyrics to determine whether any subliminal messages exist 
without evidence of subliminal messages whitehead said the case 
would not go to trial since music and lyrics are protected by the 
first amendment right to free speech 
if subliminal messages are found within the stained class 
album whitehead said the trial would concentrate on whether such 
hidden communication deserves the same first amendment protection 
the court did not believe that it was automatic that the first 
amendment protects the right to subliminal speech whitehead said 
the case is the first of its kind to advance this far in an 
american court 
judas priest members werent present in the courtroom monday 
in 1986 the families of raymond belknap and james vance both 
of nearby sparks filed suit claiming the music words and 
subliminal messages in the album drove the two into a suicide pact 
after listening to stained class for six hours drinking 
alcohol and smoking marijuana belknap 18 killed himself with a 
shotgun two days before christmas 1985 vance then 19 shot and 
seriously injured himself with the same shotgun 
reno attorney suellen fulstone who represents the band members 
said neither her clients nor cbs has possession of the master tape 
and cbs used a twotrack tape dub to record the album 
we have not been able to locate it ms fulstone said 
outside the courtroom i dont know how were going to comply 
with the courts order 
attorney kenneth mckenna representing belknaps mother aunuette 
roberson of reno scoffed at that claim 
i have never believed that the master tape was unavailable 
he said adding he has found some subliminal messages on the album 
but might discover more if the master tape were used mckenna 
refused to reveal the content of the alleged subliminal messages he 
heard

officials in eight northeastern states are 
working to adopt californias strict air pollution standards for 
cars and trucks in an effort to reduce smog 
fifteen cities or rural areas in the region have been named by 
the environmental protection agency as failing to meet its ozone 
standard eleven cities violate the standard for carbon monoxide 
most of which comes from motor vehicles metropolitan new york is 
the nations worst offender for carbon monoxide and third worst for 
ozone 
the eight states new jersey new york connecticut rhode 
island massachusetts maine new hampshire and vermont already 
are implementing regulations to reduce gasoline volatility in the 
summertime starting next year in an attempt to lower smog levels 
air pollution directors of those states are slated to discuss 
the california plan again this week before formally proposing 
regional adoption according to michael bradley executive director 
of the bostonbased northeast states for coordinated air use 
management environmental officials in vermont massachusetts and 
new york have authority to proceed without legislative approval he 
said 
experts agree that much of the ozone at any point on the 
northeastern seaboard originates with pollution upwind in the 
bostonwashington megapolis and it is practically impossible for 
any state to control the problem by itself 
an epa gasoline regulation expected to be issued later this 
year would not lower volatility to the new nescaum level until 
1992 gasoline vapors help form ozone the major component of smog 
the more volatile the fuel the more vapor that escapes and the 
more smog that is formed 
few states have been willing to get out in front of the federal 
government on initiatives against air pollution with california 
the most notable exception 
california pioneered auto air pollution controls in the 1960s 
and the clean air act of 1970 gave the state the right to impose 
stricter requirements than the federal standards for the rest of 
the country 
to avoid the confusion of 50 potentially different standards 
congress said no other state could develop its own plan but any 
state with epas permission may adopt the entire set of 
california regulations so far none has 
according to nescaum the regional adoption of the california 
standards would cut emissions of the three principal auto 
pollutants carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides and gasoline vapor 
by 50 percent within 15 years as the car and truck fleets are 
replaced with models with superior pollution controls 
one of the questions were researching is are we buying into 
future revisions of the california standards bradley said 
the assessment though is extremely favorable to air 
quality and my directors have said lets go forward 
the move likely means the elimination of the entire fleet of 
lightduty diesel vehicles and the emission requirements could 
mean a slightly higher pricetag for gasolinepowered cars and 
trucks california models look the same except for required 
dashboard indicators tied to pollution control components 
california exhausts may contain only 40 percent of the nitrogen 
oxides and 64 percent of the unburned gasoline permitted elsewhere 
california permits twice as much carbon monoxide as the federal 
standard but is planning to bring that limit down to the federal 
level 
the auto industry has built cars to the california standards 
since the mid1970s although they dont like building two versions 
of the same car california accounts for 11 percent of the national 
auto market 
the eight northeastern states account for 13 percent of the 
market 
for some makes of cars only the california version is built and 
it is marketed nationwide all basic models are offered in 
california but some enginetransmission combinations may not be 
available there 
bradley said nescaum had discussed its intention with the motor 
vehicle manufacturers association and mvma had not raised any 
concerns ann carlson of mvmas washington office said i dont 
know that weve taken a position 
bill noack of general motors corp said he was unable to locate 
any executives who were aware of nescaums plans 
according to the epa the cities or areas in the eight states 
which have violated the carbon monoxide standard are in descending 
order of severity new york city hartford conn manchester 
nh nassausuffolk ny syracuse ny nashua new hampshire 
newark nj springfield mass bergenpassaic nj jersey city 
nj and boston 
those identified as failing to meet the ozone standard are new 
york city and suburbs a connecticutmassachusetts area including 
the cities of springfield mass and bristol hartford 
middletown new britain new haven and new london in connecticut 
providence ri knox county maine york county maine atlantic

acid rain ozone depletion and the greenhouse 
warming are related to one another and must be faced together not 
as three separate problems an environmental researcher said 
monday 
the three widely discussed climate problems are related 
chemically and their effects are related economically irving 
mintzer of the world resources institute reported 
mankind must begin to think comprehensively about these 
problems and deal with them he told the opening session of the 
global greenhouse network first international conference 
the title of the meeting comes from the greenhouse effect a 
warming of the earth that scientists say appears to have begun as a 
result of increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals released 
into the air 
some researchers have speculated that the greenhouse effect may 
have been a factor in this summers extraordinarily hot dry 
weather although most say they are unsure as yet 
while conference participants concentrated on the dangers of the 
greenhouse warming minzter pointed out that chlorofluorocarbons 
one of the chemicals blamed for the warming also damage the 
earths ozone layer when they reach high altitudes these chemicals 
are widely used in refrigeration and other processes international 
efforts are underway to reduce their use 
ozone helps deflect damaging radiation from the sun and 
depletion of this shield could lead to a rise in skin cancer among 
other problems scientists fear 
burning of fossil fuels produces in addition to carbon dioxide 
sulfur and nitrogen compounds which can dissolve in the water vapor 
in the air causing the rainfall to become more acidic that 
damages trees and other plants and can even kill fish in 
increasingly acidic lakes 
getting control of this set of linked problems means dealing 
with both complex scientific issues and finding ways to coordinate 
the policies of the nations of the world mintzer said 
already the worlds temperature has increased slightly and is 
likely to continue doing so he said and work needs to begin on 
finding ways to slow down the rate of climate change 
the average telperature of the earth is about 05 degree celsius 
08 degree fahrenheit warmer than a century ago an increase 
which has been attributed to the carbon dioxide released from coal 
and other fuels being burned 
at current rates that could rise another 15 degrees to 45 
degrees by the year 2010 mintzer said while sincere efforts to 
curtail release of gases could delay that warming until 2075 or so 
he said 
while that warming doesnt sound like much it would be greater 
than any climate change in human history mintzer pointed out 
meaning there is no precedent for coping with such a shift 
that kind of warming could have serious consequences for 
agriculture including a northward shift in croplands increased 
droughts and changes in which kinds of crops can be grown said 
cynthia rosenzweig of columbia university and the national 
aeronautics and space administrations goddard institute for space 
studies 
some climate change is probably inevitable she told the 
conference and urged both scientific and policy research on coping 
with the changes that will come 
the warming will also have serious consequences for beaches 
coastal wetlands and cities and towns along the coasts added 
stephen p leatherman of the university of maryland 
warmer temperatures can be expected to cause melting of some of 
the global ice caps raising sea levels and inundating many coastal 
areas he said 
worldwide sea levels have risen a halffoot during the last 
century leatherman said potentially threatening such modern 
communities as miami beach fla and ocean city md as well as 
rural coastal marshes in louisiana and third world countries such 
as bangladesh

of the capital ambushed 40 rebels hiding in the jungle after the 
massacre of the villagers killing 12 of the insurgents according 
to the indian high commission in colombo 
the massacre was the worst burst of violence since the indian 
soldiers landed in sri lanka on oct 10 1987 to quell the 
5yearold tamil rebellion for a separate homeland in the 
northeastern part of the island 
in another development in the southern city of matara 85 miles 
south of colombo soldiers opened fire on antigovernment 
demonstrators who attacked a police station according to police 
five people were killed and four wounded also on monday two bombs 
exploded in the suburbs of colombo injuring four people including 
two soldiers police said 
in colombo and most other cities on the island shops and 
businesses remained closed monday in a protest by the majority 
sinhalese population against the governments peace overtures to 
the tamil insurgents 
the government imposed a 48hour curfew monday beginning at 6 
am ordered schools closed in many districts and put security 
personnel on alert 
there were no private vehicles on the roads and 
governmentowned buses were escorted by heavily armed soldiers

set on fire in the attack said the official he said the victims 
who were sinhalese were either fatally shot or hacked to death 
with knives and swords 
the village massacre occurred on army day which honors sri 
lankan soldiers involved in a drive against the insurgents in april 
1987 on the northern jaffna peninsula 
the sinhalese claim the government is granting too many 
concessions to the tamils including a peace accord signed in july 
1987 to end the civil war that has claimed at least 8500 lives 
under the accord the rebels agreed to surrender their weapons 
in exchange for limited autonomy but they reneged on the plan in 
october 1987 claiming they were not satisfied with the provisions 
for selfrule 
the attack on the village occurred one day before nominations 
for local elections in the province were scheduled to end the 
largest rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam called 
for a boycott but three other insurgent groups have filed

elections has not been set 
about 47000 indian soldiers were stationed in the islands 
tamildominated northeastern province to put down the rebellion 
india became involved in the ethnic conflict of its southern 
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 mllion tamils for 
the rebel cause 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
claim they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 
75 percent of the population and control sri lankas military and 
government

opposition sen juan ponce enrile on 
monday denied a published report that he and his sister were 
involved in an alleged plot to topple president corazon aquino 
the philippine daily globe quoted national security adviser 
emanuel soriano as saying a senator and his sister whom the 
newspaper identified as enrile and irma ponce enrile potenciano 
were linked to the plan 
the newspaper quoted soriano as saying enrile would fund the 
alleged plot to be staged jan 6 
enrile denied the allegations in a radio interview on monday 
i am calling soriano a liar enrile said i challenge 
soriano to come out with details of the plan so that we can 
discuss it in any proper forum 
soriano also denied the globe report in a separate radio 
interview saying i dont know who came out with that story i 
am making an official denial 
according to the globe buses owned by mrs potenciano were to 
transport renegade soldiers led by lt col gregorio honasan who 
organized an attempted coup against mrs aquino on aug 28 1987 
in which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 others 
wounded 
defense secretary fidel ramos told reporters he was aware of the 
rumored plot but said his information was based on raw 
intelligence and that honasan was unlikely to be capable of 
mounting another coup 
honasan was arrested in december and escaped from prison in 
april he was enriles security chief when the senator was defense 
minister under former president ferdinand marcos enrile was fired 
in november 1986 after a failed coup by his followers 
also monday a manila court dismissed a petition by marcos to 
return home where he was to testify in a trial on alleged bribes 
his administration received during 20 years in power 
marcos and his family fled to hawaii after the 1986 revolt that 
swept mrs aquino to the presidency 
the court dismissed marcos petition to return home where he 
faces 39 civil cases on charges he embezzled up to 10 billion 
during his rule he has not been charged with criminal violations 
and philippine law bans trials in absentia 
marcos can answer the charges by disposition which is by 
issuing legal statements from his home in honolulu the court 
resolution said 
marcos had asked the court to let him return and act as his own 
counsel during the deposition but the court said marcos return 
was a political issue requiring a decision by the aquino government 
mrs aquino has repeatedly refused to allow her predecessor to 
return on grounds of national security 
in another development philippine and us officials have 
finished talks on us bases and an agreement on their status 
through 1991 would emerge within a week according to a highly 
reliable source 
the source said philippine and us officials have finished 
talks to determine compensation security and other issues 
regarding four us bases 
its over an agreement is possible within a few days maybe 
within a weeks time said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity there was compromise on both sides he added without 
elaborating 
the philippine panel was reportedly asking 12 billion a year 
for the use of the bases but us officials are offering only half 
that amount

about 1000 guerrillas of the karen ethnic 
minority attacked burmese army posts along the moei river frontier 
with thailand a government spokesman said monday 
kyaw sann said the guerrillas had raided perimeter outposts 
sept 26 then attacked the army at methawaw on the moeis western 
bank 
more than 150 shells from mortars and recoilless rifles crashed 
into methawaw on sunday and some shells struck thai territory 
kyaw sann told a news conference the area is about 130 miles 
northeast of rangoon 
he gave no casualty figures for the battle which he described 
as one of the largest since sept 30 when government forces drove 
about 2000 burma communist party guerrillas from mong yang in 
eastern burma the guerrillas had attacked the government outpost 
sept 23 
the government said more than 200 guerrillas and 47 soldiers 
including five officers were killed at mong yang 
karens and the communists are the countrys two most powerful 
insurgencies and have fought for decades the karens seek greater 
autonomy for their areas 
burma has about 2 million karens among its 38 million people 
most live along the thaiburmese border and in the irrawaddy delta 
western diplomats in rangoon say the military government is 
trying to highlight alleged threats from the communists insurgents 
among the dozen ethnic minorities and outside powers to justify 
ruthless actions of recent weeks 
the army has no crediblity left a western diplomat based in 
rangoon said monday the military is occupying its own country 
he said the army has killed thousands of antigovernment 
demonstrators and lost its image as the protector of the 
countrys unity 
gen saw maung seized power sept 18 in an attempt to stop weeks 
of antigovernment protest and at least 440 people have been 
killed since by official count burma has been ruled by repressive 
military governments since a coup in 1962 by gen ne win 
kyaw sann said monday the government will permit freedom of 
organization and speech when law and order is restored but the 
situation now does not permit such freedoms 
he acknowledged more than 3000 students had joined the karens 
and other rebel groups since the saw maung coup 
though they could be classified as rebels we still consider 
them youths gone astray by mistake and will accept them back into 
the legal fold but we will have to regard them as rebels after a 
certain period which will have to be determined later kyaw sann 
said 
saw maung has promised to relinquish power to whoever wins 
general election but has not set a date for the vote 
the western diplomat said it is a reasonably good assumption 
that there will be elections the military doesnt want to stay in 
power that long but looking at it realistically you cannot expect 
free democratic elections to defuse the political situation 
there has to at least be a pretense of elections 
he said the military did not want to become intricately involved 
in daytoday government operations

some university of maryland students 
say theyd rather study than party in fact the campus motto may 
become id rather be studying 
people are really sitting down and taking things seriously 
said georgette kiser 20 a junior from baltimore county and an 
officer in student government i think students are saying we 
have to start studying 
ive never studied harder in my life said senior eric 
young 21 of potomac young said he was sick to death of 
marylands partyschool image something that almost kept him from 
attending the school 
after the student government association voted on the new 
slogan students presented acting president william kirwan with a 
12foot banner bearing the motto and hundreds of signatures about 
4000 students signed petitions supporting a referendum on the 
slogan 
i think the enthusiasm of some of the administrators to make 
the school top 10 is rubbing off on the students said kevin 
kalmbach 26 a sophomore from arnold and sga legislator active in 
the campaign as standards go up they students know they cant

students get the credit they deserve or 
dont deserve under a new program at daviess county high school

puts theory into practice on cases including homecoming and 
cafeteria expenses 
first county high trust had its grand opening oct 2 in the 
front lobby of daviess county high school 
as bank president davida howard welcomed customers two student 
marketing directors karla koller and michelle carter answered 
reporters questions student loan officer mike royal meanwhile 
explained the application forms to students already thinking ahead 
to homecoming expenses 
if 10 percent of the schools 1500 students open accounts the 
program will be considered successful said jim howell a business 
and dataprocessing teacher at the high school 
while the program will introduce many students to handling 
personal finances howell said the most instructive experience 
might be for those students whose loan applications are rejected 
if somebody has a lot of dms discipline marks and a lot of 
absences hes probably not going to pay back the loan without a 
lot of hassle said student banker derek sexton 
one pending loan application is from a student who wants 150 
for homecoming weekend 
among the first to start a savings account at the bank was 
junior mark girten who was lured by the 7 percent yield on savings

palestinians contend arab 
rioters are casting votes when they hurl stones in the occupied 
territories because the arab rebellion has critically influenced 
israels upcoming general election 
we are very aware of the impact of throwing stones said 
burhan attalah 24 a teacher from bethlehem who was jailed for six 
months without trial for antiisraeli activism the palestinian 
problem is reaching the bedroom of every israeli 
in campaigning monday in the coastal city of ashkelon labor 
party leader shimon peres met with loud applause when he said the 
only result of israel giving up occupied territory would be ridding 
itself of 15 million arabs 
but attalah like many palestinians believes the 10month 
uprising has strengthened the electoral prospects of rightwing 
rival yitzhak shamir and stymied hopes of a negotiated 
arabisraeli peace settlement soon 
the uprising which has left more than 290 palestinians and six 
israelis dead has become a major issue in the nov 1 parliamentary 
election films of stonethrowing palestinian protesters even have 
been used in campaign ads 
some palestinians said they favored peres leftleaning labor 
party because he supports exchanging some land in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip for peace 
however even labor supporters conceded that though peres the 
foreign minister might bring peace talks more quickly only prime 
minister shamirs hardline likud bloc can deliver a longterm 
solution to the conflict 
the peace process might start earlier with the labor party 
said jack khazmo owner of the propalestine liberation 
organization weekly al bayader assiyasi but with the likud it 
could ultimately be stronger 
the reason khazmo said is that without likud there cannot be 
the nationwide consensus required to initiate a peace process or 
make the territorial concessions demanded by palestinians 
shamir has opposed a usbacked international conference on 
middle east peace supported by peres his governing partner shamir 
also has refused to concede any of the land israel seized during 
the 1967 middle east war and supports expanded jewish settlements 
on the land 
if shamir wins this means israel isnt convinced there is a 
palestinian problem but after another year or two when israelis 
see they cannot crush the palestinian uprising by force and the 
only answer is to negotiate at that moment the peace process 
could be stronger than with a labor victory khazmo said 
if the likud wins it will introduce even stronger tactics to 
try to crush the uprising said ziad abbas a 24yearold 
freelance journalist from bethlehem who served six months in 
prison for allegedly inciting protests and that will cause the 
rebellion to explode even further 
with labor and likud running neckandneck in polls khazmo said 
the worst possible scenario would be a draw leading to another 
uneasy coalition between the two parties which he called another 
government with its hands tied in terms of a peace process 
later monday assailants threw a stone at peres car as it 
passed through kiryat gat a town developed by the government and 
mainly populated by north african immigrants who lean toward likud 
the stone caused minor damage to the roof israel radio said 
peres was not hurt and the assailants fled the radio said

the campaign for pakistans first 
free elections in a decade began over the weekend with the 
formation of alliances inspired by the memory of dead leaders 
the political battle lines were drawn between the eightparty 
islamic democratic alliance and the pakistan peoples alliance 
two groups whose members supported the late president mohammed zia 
ulhaq and the opposition pakistan peoples alliance a moderate 
threeparty coalition led by benazir bhutto 
zia who led pakistan for 11 years died in an aug 17 plane 
crash he seized power in a 1977 coup by ousting ms bhuttos 
father socialist prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto and 
ordering him hanged two years later 
ms bhutto will lead her party into nov 16 elections that are 
widely considered to be the first free elections in pakistan since 
bhuttos death 
on sunday ms bhutto invited pakistani reporters into her 
karachi home to announce that her party if elected would form a 
coalition government with the eight parties that form the movement 
for the restoration of democracy a leftleaning coalition 
mohammed khan junejo who served as zias prime minister for 
three years failed to heal a split among zia loyalists zia in may 
fired junejo and other members of the pakistan muslim league who 
formed the cabinet but kept on several other loyalists in an 
interim government 
that governing group headed by chief minister nawaz sharif 
formed its own faction in september 
the islamic democratic alliance headed by the nawaz faction 
and the pakistan peoples alliance headed by the more moderate 
junejo forces both support zias program of making islam the law 
of pakistan and his staunch military backing of anticommunist 
moslem rebels in afghanistan 
both groups draw support from zias traditional power base of 
business wealthy landowners and the military but the division 
among the zia loyalists is fueled by junejos bitterness after zia 
accused his government of corruption and incompetence 
ms bhutto espouses her fathers populism and has inherited his 
broad support among the masses but she has pulled her party away 
from his socialist economic policies including nationalization of 
industries 
she also has pledged to continue zias afghan policy and has 
called for continued close ties with the united states 
but ms bhutto has said that islam should remain a religion and 
not enter politics saying islamisation would affect womens rights 
and the countrys system of justice 
ms bhuttos allies are expected to do well in the elections 
possibly winning a simple majority in a new national assembly 
later this week the federal election commission is to allocate 
symbols to each party to aid the illiterate who comprise nearly 
threefourths of the countrys 48 million voters the approved list 
of 82 symbols include pictures of a car a slingshot and a 
butterfly

about a dozen people still are imprisoned under 
two of the main laws that have been used against political 
dissidents a soviet official said monday 
alexei glukhov deputy chief of the soviet foreign ministrys 
department for humanitarian and cultural relations also told the 
tass news agency that western estimates of more than 200 soviets 
jailed for religious or political beliefs under those laws or 
others are untrue 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international 
estimated that about 200 soviets were prisoners of conscience as of 
the beginning of september 
without mentioning amnesty international glukhov said such 
estimates are four to five times too high and include many people 
who are black marketeers and thieves murderers and spies people 
who committed military crimes traitors and mental patients under 
compulsory medical treatment glukhov said 
the soviet union released many political prisoners beginning in 
1987 and prominent figures such as independent journalist sergei 
grigoryants and religious activist alexander ogorodnikov have 
stayed out of jail for the most part since then despite periodic 
scrapes with the law 
those arrested for taking part in demonstrations now are more 
likely to be sentenced to 10 or 15day jail terms or fined 
glukhov said about a dozen people convicted under articles of 
the soviet criminal code against antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda or defaming the system remain in jail 
soviet officials have said they are studying those two laws as 
part of a review of the criminal code to make them more precise and 
prevent future abuses 
others who were tried under those laws have been found to be 
mentally ill and have been sent for compulsory treatment glukhov 
said 
the soviet union quit the world psychiatric association in 1983 
in the face of almost certain expulsion because of revelations of 
the use of psychiatry against mentally healthy political dissidents 
in january the soviet union announced new laws that it said 
would prohibit such abuse of psychiatry 
glukhov said the number of soviets held under laws on political 
and religious activity keeps diminishing every day as cases are 
reviewed people are released from penal institutions even before 
completing their terms or checked out of psychiatric hospitals 
after a reexamination 
the continuing propaganda campaign in the west does not take 
into account the stable trend for creating a lawgoverned state and 
humanizing every aspect of life in the ussr glukhov said 
he charged that the western reports were aimed at sabotaging a 
vienna conference on security and cooperation in europe and soviet 
proposals to hold a human rights conference in moscow the head of 
the us delegation to the conference ambassador warren 
zimmermann confirmed last week that soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze told secretary of state george p shultz last month 
about 40 political prisoners will be released

two men claiming fatherhood of a 7yearold 
girl are asking the us supreme court for a solomonlike decision 
which could affect other fathers in socalled reverse paternity 
cases 
this case arises out of a societal phenomenon of men assuming 
the responsibility weve always told them to assume as parents 
says attorney larry hoffman the case is scheduled to be heard 
tuesday by the high court 
in the classic paternity case a man who denies fathering a 
child out of wedlock may be forced by the courts to take financial 
responsibility for the child 
i consider this a double reverse paternity case hoffman 
says we have not one but two men coming forward wanting to 
support and care for this child 
hoffman represents a married couple gerald and carole dearing 
who are fighting a suit by michael hirschensohn mrs dearings 
former lover 
hirschensohn who says he is the biological father of victoria 
dearing wants visitation rights and the opportunity to be 
involved in the childs life says his attorney joel aaronson 
all he wants is to be able to visit with the child and give 
the child the warmth and nurturing a parent gives a child says 
aaronson 
the problem is a california law which mirrors similar statutes 
in other states it holds that a womans legal husband unless he 
is impotent or sterile is the father of any child born during the 
marriage 
aaronson says the law is outdated and unfair and wants the 
supreme court to overrule it 
the lawyer notes the increasing role of stepfathers and 
stepmothers in the lives of children of divorce and says victoria 
would not be unique among her classmates if she was sharing her 
time with two fathers 
the events which created this legal triangle reflect the 
complxities of life in the 1980s the facts acknowledged by both 
lawyers are these 
gerald and carole dearing were married in 1976 there were 
separations and from 1978 to 1984 mrs dearing had an intermittent 
sexual affair with hirschensohn in los angeles and st thomas in 
the virgin islands 
in september 1980 mrs dearing became pregnant her husband 
attended lamaze classes with her and was present in the delivery 
room when the baby was born by caesarean section on may 11 1981 
gerald was the proudest of fathers his lawyers brief 
states 
but hirschensohn says mrs dearing told him soon after the 
babys birth that the infant probably was his 
just after victorias first birthday dearing the us 
representative of a french oil company was transferred from los 
angeles to new york his wife and daughter stayed behind 
mrs dearing hirschensohn and the child then had blood tests 
which showed a 9807 percent probability that hirschensohn was the 
father dearing has not had a blood test and his lawyer claims it 
is irrelevant because the law says he is the father 
in the fall of 1982 hirschensohn sued to be named victorias 
legal father 
there were upheavals in the dearing marriage and mrs dearing 
and victoria lived with hirschensohn intermittently until april 
1984 when she accused him of peculiar behavior and obtained a 
restraining order to keep him away from the little girl that june 
she reconciled with her husband in new york 
since then hoffman said the dearings have had another child 
and a third baby is due any day 
hirschensohn a businessman who divides his time between st 
thomas and los angeles has not seen victoria again except for one 
brief visit in 1986 
appeals courts in california have ruled against hirschensohn 
upholding a law they say was designed to protect the integrity of 
the family 
marriage is a really sacred institution in the law says 
hoffman this law is traceable to antiquity 
in california the concept of husband as father was written into 
the states first laws in 1872 aaronson says its time for the 
courts to respond to societal changes 
weve come to the point in society where we can prove a 
biological connection between people who wish to be biologically 
connected he says addingthere may be a psychological father 
as well as a biological father hoffman insists the biological 
link is irrelevant 
we think other things mean as much or more he says 
because a man has biological responsibility does not make him a 
better father

the people of the falkland islands are demanding 
that immigration to the south atlantic archipelago be restricted to 
10 families a year according to the falkland islands association 
the londonbased association which fosters links with the 2000 
inhabitants of the british colony says citizens attending a recent 
public meeting in the capital of stanley said immigration should be 
restricted to 40 people a year 
the associations newsletter reported in its latest issue that 
the islanders supporters in britain were startled because many 
in britain would like the population to rise to 10000 and expand 
the economy which relies solely on fishing and sheep farming 
the newsletter canvassed opinion among residents of the island 
300 miles east of argentina and reported a variety of responses 
kitty bertrand of stanley worried that britain would dump 
undesirables on the islands 
we do not want masses of people rushed in who cannot do a 
hands turn for themselves we want doityourself types good 
sensible british people suitable for our way of life she wrote 
sydney miller said we need people especially tradesmen but 
we have nowhere to put them 
legislative councilor robin lee of port howard also cited a 
housing shortage and added if you increase immigration too 
quickly the local population becomes the minority and will have 
little say in the way the country is being run 
lee said the islanders feel that a population of 5000 in 10 to 
15 years is about right 
tim miller of manybranch farm wrote to suggest 100 immigrants a 
year for the next three years i feel most of us want change 
but we want it to be at a pace we can influence to minimize the 
bad things and maximize the benefits of the 20th century 
norma edwards a former stanley councilor wrote weve plenty 
of space for lots more people but we cant expect them to sit on a 
windblown peat bog without being able to offer them a satisfying 
and rewarding future 
mike summers an association member told the associated press 
that hundreds of britons have applied to immigrate to the islands 
but are being turned away for lack of housing 
summers said the issue was controversial because the islanders 
tend to be protective about their way of life theyre most 
afraid that their quiet wellbehaved sort of place will be affected 
if its flooded with immigrants 
the islands are claimed by argentina as the malvinas in 1982 
argentine troops overran the archipelago but surrendered to a 
british task force after a 74day war 
talks have since deadlocked over britains refusal to accept an 
argentine demand that the question of sovereignty be on the agenda

after more than three years of arguments 
motions and other legal maneuvers a federal trial is set to begin 
tuesday for five people accused in the 71 million theft from a 
wells fargo depot in 1983 
the five are accused of participating in a conspiracy to plot 
the heist and transport the stolen cash not of carrying out the 
robbery 
the government contends that the robbery the secondlargest in 
us history was plotted by los macheteros a puerto rican 
nationalist group with a history of violence 
the fbi says that a wells fargo security guard was responsible 
for the theft of the west hartford depot on sept 12 1983 victor 
m gerena formerly of hartford is accused of tying up coworkers 
loading the cash into a car and fleeing to cuba where he is still 
believed to be hiding out the fbi says 
the torn halves of a 10 bill are the only money that has been 
recovered the government contends that the money was used to 
finance the activities of los macheteros 
the trial of nine other defendants was postponed after a ruling 
by us district judge t emmet clarie earlier this year tossing 
out some wiretap evidence collected by the fbi the government is 
appealing that ruling 
two of the seven remaining defendants pleaded guilty last month 
during jury selection they are awaiting sentencing 
their pleas left five men who will stand trial tuesday 
harvardeducated segarra carlos ayes suarez norman ramirez 
talavera roberto maldonado rivera and antonio comacho negron 
ayes attorney james w bergenn said monday he expects the 
trial to last until late january 
there are expected to be few surprises during the trial with 
the possible exception of previously undisclosed evidence the 
government collected through wiretaps on the defendants in the 
united states and puerto rico 
the attorney for segarra told the court during jury selection 
that his client knew in advance that the heist would occur and 
later came into possession of some of the stolen cash but the 
attorney leonard weinglass said his client didnt plan the 
robbery and didnt participate in it 
weinglass said he would argue that is not a crime to keep silent 
about a planned robbery 
the us justice department has indicated that it considers this 
an important case the defendants arrests in august 1985 were 
announced by thenus attorney general edwin meese iii 
during arraignments in us district court three years ago 
heavily armed federal agents closed streets and mounted rooftops to 
provide security 
but security has been relaxed during the more than 18 months of 
pretrial arguments some defendants have settled in hartford 
sending their children to local schools 
clarie ordered the names of the 12 jurors and six alternates 
kept secret the judge said he wanted to protect the jurors 
particularly from mass mailings by supporters of the defendants

mount washington nh three lightly clad hikers emerged safe 
today after 24 hours in snow fog and wind on mount washington 
where the windchill at the summit was 17 below zero this morning 
the three ignored advice from a shelter caretaker on the 
6288foot mountain sunday evening and continued toward the summit 
said peter crane a member of the staff at a mountaintop weather 
observatory 
a search official michael torrey of the appalachian mountain 
club said the three and a companion who turned back part way 
probably set out from pinkham notch on the eastern side of the 
northeasts tallest mountain at about 2 pm sunday 
he said the hikers had no rain gear or warm clothes and were 
wearing blue jeans and poor boots one had a sweatshirt another a 
sweater and the third a parka their only provisions were two 
apples and a soda bottle full of water 
maj henry mock of the state fish and game department said they 
reached crawford notch a pass on the western side of the mountain 
around 2 pm in good condition 
he identified them as steve sardella 20 of marlboro mass 
matt dube 21 of bethany conn and andy stewart 23 of syosset 
new york he said the man who turned back is noel bouvier of boston 
washington is notorious for severe and quickly changing weather 
to survive in that kind of weather conditions you have to be 
very well equipped mock said before the three were found 
fish and game employees and volunteers helped search for the 
men but weather conditions were too poor to send out planes 
officials said 
inexperienced hikers frequently get into trouble in the white 
mountains because the weather changes quickly and is much harsher 
at higher elevations than at trailheads in valleys below 
the 6288foot mountain has some of the worst weather on earth 
snow has fallen on the summit in every month and numerous hikers 
have died after getting lost in blowing snow and fog in the past 
century

lubomir strougal who was 
considered an economic reformer and had been the nations premier 
for more than 18 years resigned monday and gave up his seat on the 
12member communist party politburo 
peter colotka premier of slovakia also quit his job and 
membership on the partys ruling body communist party chief milos 
jakes announced the resignations at a plenary session of the party 
central committee the official news agency ctk reported 
the shakeup in czechoslovakia follows similar government 
reorganizations in the soviet union hungary and poland as well as 
unrest in yugoslavia 
the names of strougal colotka and foreign minister bohuslav 
chnoupek came up in a corruption scandal last year 
stanisdlav babinsky who ran a catering and supply operation in 
rural slovakia was sentenced to 14 years in prison after a 
threemonth trial that ended june 30 1987 
nine other defendants also were sent to prison for stealing 
socialist ownership on a large scale for several years and 
committing other criminal acts 
babinsky named strougal and colotka during the trial but it was 
not clear what favors they were supposed to have received chnoupek 
was said to have been given furniture which he later paid for 
when he took over as party chief from gustav husak in december 
last year jakes said the fight against corruption would be among 
his priorities 
in his speech monday to the central committee jakes also 
announced other changes in the politburo party secretariat 
central committee and the federal czech and slovak governments 
czechoslovakia consists of two republics of equal rights the 
czech socialist republic and the slovak socialist republic each is 
governed by a national council which delegates to an overall 
federal assembly responsibility for constitutional and foreign 
affairs defense and important economic decisions 
the primary source of power in czechoslovakia is the communist 
party 
ctk quoted the party chief as saying the actions were taken in 
the interest of mastering the demanding tasks of economic and 
social restructuring but its report did not mention other names 
rumors of leadership changes have circulated for months jakes 
and other officials have indicated younger people would be promoted 
to senior positions 
strougal63 said during interviews with western journalists 
earlier this year that he wanted to step down 
he was considered a strong advocate of economic reform similar 
to that being promoted in the soviet union by president mikhail s 
gorbachev but his proposals were diluted and delayed by a party 
leadership that has appeared reluctant to follow the soviet example 
jakes said monday there are persistent serious shortcomings 
in the economy he praised the soviet unions peace policy but 
did not mention gorbachevs political and economic changes 
last april in remarks ending a twoday central committee 
session jakes said the leadership wanted to elevate younger 
comrades and thus create conditions for further successful 
fulfillment of party tasks 
he said it was an important requirement to ensure that 
qualified young people are more frequently proposed for key 
economic and other jobs 
colotka has been premier of slovakia since may 1969 and deputy 
federal premier since september 1969 strougal replaced oldrich 
cernik as federal premier in january 1970 
at mondays meeting first of a twoday plenary session on 
ideology jakes also made clear that independent human rights 
ecological and other groups would not be allowed to operate as they 
do in neighboring hungary 
formation of antisocialist political structures will not be 
tolerated and will be prosecuted he declared 
the politburo met wednesday to discuss personnel changes and 
there was speculation that vasil bilak long in charge of the 
ideology portfolio also would retire 
jan fojtik also an ideologist was put on the politburo in 
april and his authority has appeared to grow 
jakes replaced gustav husak as party leader in december

leaders of the fading florida campaign of michael 
dukakis got out their sweaters monday and began heading to ohio and 
michigan 
im going to miss this place said paul pezzella the 
dukakis state campaign director as he and steve rosenfeld state 
political director handed over their titles and duties to miami 
attorney alan g greer and volusia county commissioner clay 
henderson 
pezzella goes to cleveland as getoutthevote director for 
dukakis in ohio and rosenfeld will be based in columbus handling 
communications and scheduling a 1000ahead fund raiser on miami 
beach will go on as scheduled tuesday without dukakis who is 
staying home to prepare for his thursday night debate 
five other dukakis staffers in florida have been transferred to 
ohio and three are going to michigan last month the state 
campaign press secretary and a handful of other workers were moved 
to illinois there are no campaign visits to florida scheduled for 
dukakis or running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen 
pezzella said dukakis wasnt writing off floridas 21 electoral 
votes but the national campaign obviously decided that ohio with 
23 electoral votes and other midwestern states were better 
opportunities than florida republican presidential candidates have 
carried florida in seven of the last nine elections 
pezzella dukakis former chief lobbyist in massachusetts and 
rosenfeld the governors former chief legal counsel directed 
dukakis surprising lopsided victory in the march 8 democratic 
presidential primary in florida then returned to the state in 
august 
greer whos been a leader of the florida dukakis campaign for 
more than a year said every transferred staffer is being replaced 
by experienced floridians and the campaign maintains 30 fulltime 
staffers and some 15 offices in the state 
obviously this is not a florida election it is a national 
election greer said we have to have a national surge 
assuming we get that national surge we have the organization here 
to move 
greer said dukakis is substantially behind in florida but 
not nearly as badly as an atlanta constitution survey that gave 
bush a 26point bulge in the state 
cori zywotow who has taken over as state campaign press 
secretary said some florida workers are offended at the idea that 
the departure of bostonians means the campaign is giving up 
we have a lot of talented people she said 
she came to the campaign after being spokeswoman for the city of 
miami police department rocked in the past three years by 
indictments of several police officers on drug charges 
talking about having experience with crises she said 
adding quickly thats not the right word i mean experience with 
excitement

christian members of parliament 
authorized the head of the dominant maronite catholic community on 
monday to negotiate with rival moslems to elect a new lebanese 
president in efforts to end a political crisis 
we have given patriarch nasrallah sfeir authorization to 
negotiate in order to reach agreement as soon as possible on the 
president who will be elected by parliament deputy speaker 
albert mokhaiber said 
we have pledged to abide by any agreement the patriarch 
reaches in order to resolve the current crisis 
mokhaiber made the statement after the 29 parliamentarians met 
for 2 hours with sfeir in suburban bkirki 
mokhaiber indicated that a new president might be elected before 
oct 18 when the term of parliament speaker hussein husseini a 
shiite moslem expires 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 23 when 
former president amin gemayels sixyear term ended without 
parliament having chosen a successor that spawned rival christian 
and moslem governments with each claiming legitimacy 
parliament failed to convene before gemayels departure to elect 
a successor when christians boycotted three electoral sessions to 
block the election of syrianbacked candidates 
the crisis is cementing lebanons de facto partition into 
sectarian cantons in the nations 13yearold civil war 
the christians new move suggested that sfeir may sound out 
moslem leaders and possibly syria and the united states on a 
compromise candidate 
syria the main power broker in lebanon backs lebanons moslems 
and sought to promote a prosyrian christian into the presidency in 
a bid to end the civil war 
minutes before gemayel stepped down he handed power to army 
commander gen michel aoun a maronite naming him caretaker prime 
minister of a sixman military cabinet 
all three moslem officers named to the aoun cabinet refused to 
serve and moslem leaders declared allegiance to the incumbent 
government of acting prime minister salim hoss a syrianbacked 
sunni moslem 
under an unwritten covenant dating from lebanons independence 
from france in 1943 maronites have held the posts of president 
army commander and central bank governor the premier traditionally 
was a sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite 
christians were deemed to be the majority in 1943 moslems now 
comprise an estimated 55 percent of lebanons 4 million people 
however and demand an equal share of power 
hoss warned monday that formally partitioning lebanon would lead 
to endless fighting between christians and moslems 
i challenge the advocates of federalization or partition to 
draw up the borders of their cantons this cannot be done hoss 
told the associated press 
he was responding to a suggestion by samir geagea leader of the 
main christian militia that federalization would end the deadlock 
over the presidential crisis and the civil war 
political decentralization or federalization will not 
bring an end to the state of war but will kindle an endless war on 
the borders of the cantons it will also lead to endless wars in 
the streets alleys hills villages and towns hoss declared 
rightwing christians favor a federal system they believe it 
will safeguard their western way of life from what they perceive as 
the threat of irans brand of islamic fundamentalism such 
fundamentalism is growing among the shiites here lebanons largest 
single sect 
shiite fundamentalist leaders held a mass rally in a south 
beirut mosque monday under sheikh mohammed hussein fadlallah 
spiritual guide of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
they said later in a statement that they unanimously rejected 
any form of partition as a blow against islam and also rejected a 
french proposal that un forces be sent to beirut to oversee the 
election of a new president

republican george bush accusing rival 
michael dukakis of having so much sympathy for criminals 
proposed on monday to increase criminal penalties and to give 
victims an expanded role in criminal proceedings 
im going to bring an attitude to the white house that has 
more sympathy for the victims of crime than for the criminals 
the vice president said in a columbus day addresss to an 
italianamerican group 
bush said victims of crime should have the statutory right to 
be informed of be present and be heard at every critical stage of 
the criminal justice process 
he told his audience at a knights of columbus hall that because 
of the holiday you will be spared my usual political speech 
then he proceeded to hammer away at his familiar campaign theme 
that dukakis is soft on crime 
ive spoken at length about the differences i have with my 
opponent on this fundamental issue and thats not my purpose 
today suffice it to say that i think there is something very wrong 
when there is so much sympathy for criminals and very little left 
over for victims the gop nominee said 
bush proposed making it easier for victims to collect civil 
judgments for restitution and allowing them to get more money 
automatically if a convicts financial circumstances improve 
he also called for expanding a federal fund created to 
compensate victims of crimes 
i believe we should consider raising the fees charged 
defendents upon conviction so that more money can be channeled to 
victims he said 
on this columbus day we are rediscovering america it is a 
kind and gentle nation with opportunities limited only by our 
dreams bush said and we refuse to let criminals snuff out 
those dreams 
earlier meeting with reporters on his air force two campaign 
plane bush said he favors review of the federal prison furlough 
program although he has no specific revisions in mind i just 
want to be sure it never slips into the massachusetts model 
he said 
bushs criticism of the massachusetts program which until 
modified allowed convicted murderers to be released on weekend 
furloughs has prompted dukakis the governor of that state to 
criticize the federal furlough system 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen was quick to 
respond to 
bushs decision to review the federal system after 2818 days 
of sitting on the sidelines george bush has finally admitted that 
there is something wrong with a federal furlough program that gives 
45day vacations to drug traffickers bentsen said in a statement 
issued in washington 
the bentsen said more than 7000 drug offenders received 
furloughs last year and 138 prisoners on federal furlough escaped 
in 1986 including a man who hijacked a helicopter and returned to 
prison to free his bankrobber girlfriend 
bush walked down the main thoroughfare of an italianamerican 
neighborhood he stopped at a bakery and at an athletic club where 
he briefly joined a game of pool with a single shot bush drove a 
purple 4 ball diagonally across the length of the table and 
into a corner pocket to the cheers of club patrons 
the vice president returned to washington at midday to prepare 
for his second debate with dukakis in los angeles on thursday and 
to play tennis with professional ace pam shriver and members of the 
bush family 
the vice president has frequently visited new jersey which his 
campaign officials regarded as a crucial election battleground with 
its 16 electoral votes 
were going after reagan democrats youre not going to see 
many republicans here richard bond the campaigns political 
director told reporters during the tour of the chambersburg 
section of trenton 
reagan democrats are traditionally democratic voters who voted 
for president reagan in 1980 and 1984 
bush aides were heartened by a poll in sundays editions of the 
record of hackensack showing him leading dukakis by eight 
percentage points in new jersey 
asked by reporters if he thought the debate performance of 
running mate dan quayle had hurt the gop ticket in the polls bush 
replied the only poll i heard of i like very much 
he was referring to a survey by the atlanta constitution and 
journal which showed bush with a solid lead over dukakis in 15 
southern states 
but bush said how can i say i believe in polls im the guy 
thats been getting kicked in them not so many days ago 
bush leaves tuesday for an eightday campaign swing that will 
include the thursday debate and at least four days of campaigning 
in california

the dalai lama said he will shun 
politics if tibet gains independence from china and any talks he 
has with the chinese will center on tibets future not on his own 
return home 
the exiled spiritual leader said he would stay out of any future 
government because his status as godking of tibetan buddhists 
would inhibit the development of democracy 
my participation would be a hindrance of a healthy democratic 
athomsphere he told a news conference at the swedish 
international peace research insitute on the last stop of a nordic 
tour 
let the young intelligent tibetans carry the responsibility 
for leading the government i want to remain a simple buddhist

independence but expressed the hope of independence in his 
lifetime 
the dalai lama left tibet in 1959 
asked monday when he thought he might be able to return he 
said the issue is not my return but the fate of 6 million 
people when the situation inside tibet becomes satisfactory then 
the refugees will return including myself 
he urged china to ease restrictions on tourists and journalists 
and let them judge whether the country is as calm as the 
chinese claim 
government officials in finland norway denmark and sweden did 
not meet him officially during this tour because chinese embassies 
let it be known beijing would not approve 
the dalai lama called his visit nonpolitical and said he 
had no special thing to say to scandinavian governments 
during five days in sweden he plans to address the foreign 
policy institute and attend public peace functions

pope john paul ii on monday urged the 
creation of a new economic system providing greater employment as 
he toured the rustbelt area of northeastern france 
john paul has made the dignity of work and the need for jobs a 
persistent theme of his 10year papacy and one which figured 
prominently in his speeches in metz and nancy on the third day of 
his fourday visit to the alsacelorraine region 
the pope also announced he was sending a letter of encouragement 
to inmates in french jails 
in strasbourg a shouting match broke out during the opening 
session of the european parliament over the speech the pope was 
scheduled to deliver tuesday niall andrews an irish catholic 
conservative accused the rev ian paisley of planning to disrupt 
the speech 
he called paisley another parliamentarian and leader of the 
hardline irish protestant democratic unionist party an 
institutional terrorist paisley shouted back that he opposed 
both the pope and the roman catholic church and that he planned to 
express his opposition during the pontiffs address 
in nancy john paul told more than 40000 faithful jammed into a 
square that economic and social problems should not blind them to 
the presence of god in the world 
certain human hopes seem to be sinking said the 68yearold 
pontiff wearing a bright red cape and speaking under a white 
coneshaped canopy 
he said mines and heavy industries that once flourished are in 
decline and demanded that a whole new economic restructuring be 
invented and put in place to solve the unemployment dilemma 
if faith does not dictate readymade answers it does provide 
the courage to undertake the search to seek the appropriate type 
of development it suggests that human work be reevaluated in 
accordance with the dignity of the person 
although alsacelorraine reports an unemployment rate only 
slightly higher than the national average of 105 percent the 
jobless rate in industrial cities of the region is higher the 
decline in heavy industry and mining has particularly hurt 
immigrants who came in waves from elsewhere in europe and north 
africa during the industrial boom years of the 1960s and 1970s and 
make up nearly 10 percent of the population of metz and the 
surrounding area 
the pope complimented the region for welcoming foreigners and 
called on residents to reject the secularizing trends that have 
resulted in a sharp drop in french attendance at mass since world 
war ii 
ultraconservative elements of the roman catholic church in 
france have expressed concern about the large number of moslem 
immigrants islam now the secondlargest religion in france 
arrived with the influx of immigrants from north africa 
the conservative catholics were prominent among the suporters of 
national front leader jeanmarie le pen who won 14 percent of the 
vote in the first round of presidential balloting last spring and 
campaigned against immigration

trumpets blared and fireworks lit the sky 
monday night as president hosni mubarak inaugurated cairos new 
opera house 17 years after fire destroyed the one built a century 
ago for the opening of the suez canal 
japan paid for the 50 million ivorycolored neoislamic 
cultural complex which is officially called the cairo education 
and culture center and presented the first kabuki theater 
performance on the nile its unofficial name is the opera house 
for the building destroyed by fire in 1971 
floodlights bathed the ivory domes as officials and members of 
the art world walked into the 1300seat main theater monday night 
the center represents japans largest aid outlay for a project 
with a primarily cultural function mubarak specifically requested 
money for such a project during a visit to japan in 1983 
because of emperor hirohitos grave illness the japanese royal 
family was not represented at the inaugural official japanese 
parties and receptions were canceled 
kajima corp began construction 40 months ago the complex was 
completed ahead of schedule and turned over to egypt last march 
on monday night vans full of security police stood by the white 
gates and traffic was diverted from the area hundreds of people 
gathered near the gates and between mounted soldiers on a nearby 
bridge to catch watch the pomp and ceremony 
mubarak arrived in a convoy of at least 10 mercedes automobiles 
preceded by cabinet ministers he unveiled a plaque and cut a 
ribbon 
in the rosecolored hall egypts national anthem played before 
the japanese musicdance drama performed by male actors dressed in 
exquisite costumes 
khedive ismail built the original opera house which was 
inaugurated in 1869 as part of an extravagent suez canal 
dedication ismail commissioned the opera aida from the 
giuseppe verdi for the opening but the italian composer did not 
finish it in time and the work premiered in the opera house two 
years later

either end of the lawn in the new complex on gezira island in the 
nile one of cairos wealthiest quarters 
in addition to the main space the education and culture center 
also has two smaller theaters a museum an art gallery a 
conference hall and training facilities 
japanese artists worked until less than two months ago with 
complex director magda saleh to prepare the opening nights kabuki 
performance and for later musical and ballet shows 
then a new director ratiba hefny was named without explanation 
we werent even told officially about the change until two 
weeks after it was made said hiroshi shiojiri first secretary 
for cultural affairs at the japanese embassy 
customs officials also had delayed the arrival of 40 crates of 
equipment and luggage for monday nights show officials said they 
held up baggage because of a rumor that a drug smuggler was on the 
egypt air flight bringing the troupe of 50 from tokyo 
the baggage was delivered later 
the japanese give grants only for educational not cultural 
purposes said mohammed salmawi of the culture ministry so we 
agreed to call it an educational and cultural center but its 
really mainly cultural 
kajima employed about 500 egyptians on the project with 30 
japanese engineers and administrators 
the opening prompted lastminute cleanup jobs on gezira island 
four huge bronze lions guarding the bridge were washed down 
nearby buildings painted and fences mended workers planted 
greenery and cleared trash from nearby plazas 
some egyptians grumble about so much money being spent on a 
complex to bring basically alien culture to the nation they say 
egypt with a population of 54 million and a per capita annual 
income of 600 would be served better by a hospital lowcost 
housing or schools

an opera director who once staged antony and 
cleopatra in a swimming pool is now portraying the main character 
of richard wagners opera tannhaeuser as a fallen television 
evangelist 
peter sellars production of tannhaeuser was set to open 
monday at the chicago lyric opera 
i want people to realize that tannhaeuser is about wagners 
own fleshly struggles and his invention of his own morality 
sellars said 
in wagners opera tannhaeuser is a german knight in the middle 
ages who is in love with a virtuous woman but who also indulges in 
orgies with the pagan goddess venus he eventually achieves 
salvation through a miracle 
sellars tannhaeuser is set in a nevada motel room with the 
hero modeled after televangelist jimmy swaggart who made a tearful 
televised confession last february that he had committed an 
unspecified sin against god and his family 
there were a lot of parallels between jimmy swaggart and 
wagner both were cult figures who cloaked themselves in public 
religiosity and promoted themselves shamelessly sellars said 
we admire them sure but we also in a strange way distrust 
them 
sellars 31 says he wants to shock people into a greater 
understanding of wagners opera 
i want to give people something profound and sad and beautiful 
to think about he said 
sellars whose recent operatic triumphs include last years 
acclaimed production of nixon in china was invited to chicago 
to do tannhaeuser so audiences could get a taste of 
contemporary opera says ardis krainik general director of the 
lyric opera 
peter sellars is without question one of the presentday 
musical theater geniuses of america ms krainik said theres 
always a lot of controversy surrounding peter 
sellars production credits range from the odd to bizarre he 
once set mozarts cosi fan tutti in a diner and set the same 
composers the marriage of figaro in the trump tower his only 
previous experience with wagner was a condensed version of the 
ring of the niebelung done with puppets in a denver shopping 
mall 
sellars says he is happy with the controversy that surrounds his 
work 
i think it will be the first tannhaeuser that will feel 
active he said people will say my god theres a lot 
happening here

communist authorities put more 
police on the streets and imposed unspecified urgent measures 
in montenegros capital monday but protests kept up fed by 
economic crisis and ethnic tension 
protest has swept much of southern and eastern yugoslavia in 
recent weeks police used violent tactics for the first time over 
the weekend to disperse montenegrin students and workers demanding 
dismissal of local communist party leaders 
several yugoslavs reported that civil defense units in belgrade 
were put on a higher level of alert saturday the sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
no sign of trouble surfaced in belgrade 
president raif dizdarevic appealed for calm on national 
television sunday night warning of unspecified emergency measures 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and communist party 
structure 
unrest persisted monday in titograd the capital of montenegro 
280 miles southwest of belgrade and the regional party leadership 
held an emergency meeting the official news agency tanjug reported 
about 15000 people at niksic 30 miles north of titograd 
joined 2800 striking steelworkers monday for a street rally 
tanjug said twelve demonstrators were detained there sunday night 
police used clubs and tear gas to break up weekend crowds in 
titograd and to disperse marchers in niksic who were on their way 
to titograd 
the titograd rally was an explosion of anger over hardships 
resulting from the austerity program imposed by the government in 
may because of a 21 billion foreign debt and an annual inflation 
rate of 217 percent the unemployment rate is about 15 percent 
concern for montenegrins in southern serbias troubled kosovo 
province also has stirred passions serbs and montenegrins in 
kosovo most of them christians are a minority to the mainly 
moslem ethnic albanian population 
tanjug reported without details that urgent measures were 
imposed monday in titograd it said later 1000 construction 
workers called off a strike after local party leaders promised to 
consider their demands 
an official reached at the government information office in 
titograd reported more police patrols in some parts of the city and 
said civilian defense units were told to display special 
vigilance and prevent any repetition of the unrest of the past 
weekend 
he said steps would be taken to ease shortages of meat bread 
and cooking oil 
in belgrade the federal government said it was rescinding a 
285 percent increase in electricity prices announced oct 1 
workers in titograd blame local party leaders for the economic 
troubles and demand they be dismissed 
the party leadership in vojvodina an autonomous province of 
serbia was dismissed last week after a similar public outcry 
protesters in niksic demanded monday that montenegros police 
chief be fired because of the weekend violence dramatizing their 
point by hoisting a man wearing a gas mask on the shoulders of the 
crowd tanjug reported 
we are not demanding the gallows for those who ordered the 
beating up of our comrades we are only demanding their sacking 
the agency quoted worker miloslav michunovich as saying 
mondays rallies in montenegro were largely the work of those 
who support slobodan milosevic the serbian communist party leader 
who is popular among serbs and montenegrins for his defense of 
their fellow slavs in kosovo 
two of yugoslavias six republics slovenia and bosnia 
herzegovina issued statements supporting dizdarevics 
denunciation of nationalist protests 
but the leadership in serbia defended its drive for more control 
of its two provinces which are nominally autonomous 
that indicated a showdown between rival politicians and 
republics at a key meeting set for oct 17 to decide changes in the 
national communist party leadership 
stern response to protests could work against milosevic who 
opponents fear will ride the wave of ethnic emotion to greater 
national power

the wife of president augusto pinochet 
apparently wants her husband to stay in office but his chief of 
staff said monday its too early to discuss whether the general 
will run in the open presidential election next year 
pinochet has said nothing on the issue but the widely read 
conservative daily el mercurio on monday quoted pinochets wife 
lucia as urging supporters to form a grand support movement so 
that the president will change the constitution and can be 
reelected 
it said mrs pinochet made the comment sunday at the couples 
summer retreat bucalemu 
when asked whether the 72yearold general might run in the 
election planned for december 1989 orlando poblete told reporters 
the question was premature 
poblete is secretarygeneral of the military government a 
cabinetlevel post similar to chief of staff he spoke after the 
15member cabinet met with pinochet who lost a plebiscite last 
week on extending his presidency to 1997 
pinochet ratified his confidence in our carrying out the 
functions of our various portfolios and discussed the economic 
social and political future poblete said all cabinet members 
offered their resignations after the plebiscite defeat but 
pinochet rejected them 
lawyers disagree on whether pinochets 1980 consitution allows 
him to be a candidate in open elections 
most including several supporters say he cannot because of the 
stipulation that presidents cannot succeed themselves the general 
seized power in september 1973 ousting the elected government of 
president salvador allende an avowed marxist who died in the coup 
defense minister patricio carvajal a retired admiral said 
lawyers told him pinochet could run if he stepped down a little 
before the election in which case there would be an interim 
president and pinochet technically would not be succeeding himself 
carvajal told reporters he thought changing the constitution 
could be more complicated than stepping down before the vote 
pinochet received 31 million yes votes in last wednesdays 
vote about 840000 fewer than the no votes promoted by his 
political opposition even in defeat he remains in power until 
march 11 1990 when the winner of the 1989 general elections is to 
take office under terms of the constitution 
opposition leaders want it amended to move up the election and 
pinochets departure the general has said he will not permit 
changes and will serve out his term

premier nikolai i ryzhkov scolded north atlantic 
treaty organization nations on monday for trying to extract 
concessions from moscow in negotiations aimed at reducing 
conventional forces in europe tass reported 
ryzhkovs attack came in a speech at a kremlin dinner honoring 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky who came to the soviet capital 
on monday for four days of talks with soviet officials 
regrettably some nato countries delegations are still unable 
to overcome the temptation of pressing the socialist countries yet 
one more time in a bid to gain concessions ryzhkov said 
eastern and western european countries have been trying for 
years in vienna the austrian capital to agree on mutual cuts in 
conventional arms and troops on the continent 
western countries led by the united states have claimed that 
purported soviet superiority in these forces has become more of a 
threat now that the superpowers are scrapping their medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles worldwide 
ryzhkov said the vienna talks could be sucessfully completed 
soon if it were not for what he said was the wests intransigence 
tass did not immediately report vranitzkys speech or indicate 
whether he responded to ryzhkovs charges about the conventional 
force talks 
earlier in the day the two met privately

a powerful beam striking the earth from 
a twin star system 14000 light years away could herald a new type 
of particle that physicists said confounds the standard theories of 
physics 
the beam carrying a million billion electron volts of energy 
comes from a neutron star half of a binary star system named 
hercules x1 in the constellation hercules said dr guarang yodh 
a physicist at the university of california at irvine 
the neutron star is nearly the size of earths moon but is 
extremely dense with a mass nearly double the suns 
the other half of the star system about 4 million miles from 
the neutron star is a star similar to the sun 
the neutron star is a large spinning magnet generating massive 
electromagnetic fields and giving off powerful radiation 
the beam first detected at los alamos national laboratory in 
july 1986 initially was believed to be electrically neutral gamma 
rays which are highenergy light waves or photons 
the problem with that interpretation was that the beam hits 
way up in the atmosphere and produces a shower of particles yodh 
said friday in a telephone interview 
gamma rays are not supposed to do that said dr darragh nagle 
a physicist at the los alamos lab 
thats the thing thats interesting and puzzling about the 
finding he said there is the possible presence of a new 
particle that is coming out of the study of a powerful neutral beam 
it isnt the power of the neutral beam its this peculiar 
interaction in the earths atmosphere nagle said in a telephone 
interview 
yodh said the discovery should lead to new insights about 
sources of energy in the universe and about the elementary 
structure of matter 
both of them are extremely relevant to our understanding of 
our universe i think that is the main impact it will make on 
society yodh said 
yodh said scientists have come up with several explanations for 
the strange beam which also has been detected by observatories in 
arizona and hawaii one explanation is that it is made of a 
previously unknown particle 
it is unexplainable by conventional theory presentday 
knowledge yodh said 
scientists delayed in publishing their findings because they 
have been rechecking their research and trying to come up with an 
explanation he said 
weve been trying to make it go away weve been trying to say 
its some mistake but we cant yodh said 
a technical paper on the research will soon be published in the 
international scientific journal physical review letters nagle 
said

oring seals in the joints of space 
shuttle discoverys left booster rocket suffered no damage during 
last months launch nasa reported monday as workers began 
disassembling the right booster 
the shuttle challenger was destroyed and its crew of seven lost 
on jan 28 1986 when superhot gas and flames burned through the 
synthetic rubber orings in a faulty joint in one of its boosters 
discoverys sept 28 launch was the first since the accident 
and its two solid fuel rockets burned for two minutes as planned 
and then parachuted into the atlantic ocean where they were 
recovered and returned to the kennedy space center for inspection 
officials reported earlier that an initial inspection after 
recovery indicated the rockets were in excellent condition 
ed medal a spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administrations marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
reported late monday that engineers had completed dismantled both 
booster rockets 
all six field joints were taken apart and looked at he 
said everything looks great there was no evidence of hot gas or 
heat on any of the orings the new bonded installation did its 
job 
there are three joints in each of the 149foottall rockets 
each joint has three orings 
he said new insulation added to the joint area also worked as 
intended in keeping burning gases away from the rings 
on challenger each joint had two orings in redesigning the 
rocket engineers at the marshall center and at morton thiokol the 
manufacturer added a third oring as part of a metal lip called a 
capture feature intended to prevent joint movement under pressure 
of ignition 
discovery and its fiveman crew landed at edwards air force base 
in california on oct 3 after a fourday flight during which the 
astronauts deployed a communications satellite conducted 
experiments and tested new orbiter systems 
the shuttle was ferried back to canaveral on saturday riding 
piggyback atop a modified boeing 747 jetliner it was back at its 
launch site monday being inspected in a processing facility at the 
kennedy space center 
discoverys crew will describe their mission at a news 
conference tuesday at the johnson space center in houston 
nasa officials said discovery returned to earth in good shape 
and would require little refurbishment once a few protective 
thermal tiles have been replaced workers will begin preparing it 
for its next flight scheduled feb 18 with another communications 
satellite as the cargo 
meanwhile atlantis is being readied in an adjoining processing 
bay for the next shuttle flight a classified defense department 
mission set for launch in late november 
a payload for a future mission arrived saturday by truck from a 
martin marietta plant near denver colo it is the unmanned 
magellan spacecraft scheduled to be released from atlantis cargo

a federal judge monday acquitted one of two 
indian activists on a hostagetaking charge in the takeover of a 
newspaper office but let stand weapons charges against both 
defendants 
us district judge terrence boyle in dismissing the charge 
against timothy jacobs said his reading of the statute showed that 
a demand on the government had to be not just incidental but 
material 
boyle said he would let the jury decide if codefendant eddie 
hatcher was guilty of the charge 
we have achieved a great victory jacobs attorney lewis 
pitts said at a news conference during a court recess we 
predicted several months ago that the federal hostagetaking 
charges would be dropped and they have been at least against 
jacobs 
we believe the judge should have in fact ordered an 
acquittal on those charges against eddie hatcher pitts said 
it underscores how unfair it is to eddie not to have his lawyer 
with him 
boyle ordered hatcher to represent himself after hatcher refused 
to accept other counsel his attorney william kunstler is 
involved in a case in new york and has been unable to participate 
in hatchers trial 
attorneys for jacobs argued friday that prosecutors had failed 
to prove that he and hatcher had made a demand on the federal 
government during their takeover of the robesonian newspaper in 
lumberton on feb 1 
the court is of the opinion that it is premature concerning 
the evidence with respect to defendant hatcher to make a ruling and 
that this should proceed to the jury boyle said 
but he said prosecutors had presented no evidence that jacobs 
had made a demand on the government or had aided hatcher in making 
a demand 
the hostagetaking charge was linked with a second charge of 
committing a violent crime with an illegal firearm boyle also 
dismissed that charge against jacobs 
hatcher and jacobs still face charges of conspiracy making an 
illegal firearm possessing an unregistered firearm and conveying 
false information concerning explosives 
in a written order boyle advised defense attorneys that he 
would not accept their necessity defense the judge said there 
was no direct relationship between the hostages taken at the 
robesonian and the threats perceived by hatcher and jacobs 
the two had argued that their lives were in jeopardy because of 
information they said linked law enforcement officers to drug 
trafficking in robeson county they claimed they had no choice but 
to take hostages at the newspaper to publicize their case 
but boyle wrote that the action should have been taken against 
the people who posed the threat not innocent people 
pitts said that decision would force lawyers to try an alternate 
defense 
the judge in his ruling said allowing the necessity defense 
would create chaos and anarchy but chaos and anarchy already 
existed in robeson county prior to feb 1 pitts said 
monday afternoon hatcher attempted to call one witness and 
questioned another witness ending his twoweek refusal to 
participate in the trial hatcher agreed to question former 
pembroke police chief kirby ammons who had been called by jacobs 
attorneys 
im not an attorney but yes sir i do have some questions 
hatcher responded when boyle asked him if he wished to question 
ammons 
did you not tell me my life was in danger with this 
information i had hatcher asked ammons referring to alleged 
information on drug dealing involving law enforcement officers 
i dont remember that ammons said 
hatcher also attempted to call a witness to the stand but boyle 
said he would hear defense evidence for jacobs first and then hear 
from hatcher

hungarianborn brothers charged with 
spying against nato said monday they approached the cia about 
selling classified material but were turned down according to a 
news report of the trial 
sandor and imre kercsik naturalized swedish citizens ages 48 
and 34 respectively were arrested in august after a spy ring 
allegedly run by former us army sgt clyde lee conrad was 
uncovered 
conrad was stationed at a nato base in west germany and had 
access to classified data on operations of the western alliance he 
faces espionage charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in 
prison 
the trial of the kercsik brothers began monday at molndal 
district court outside goteborg in southwestern sweden 
the report said the brothers told the court conrad invented an 
imaginary highranking intelligence officer named david in hungary 
then had them write a letter offering classified material and 
saying conrad wanted to defect 
according to the swedish news agency tt the brothers testified 
the cia paid tens of thousands of dollars for sample material but 
ended the contacts later because of dissatisfaction with the 
information 
it said the brothers contested prosecutor sven olof hakanssons 
suggestion they wanted to approach the west out of fear of being 
disclosed as east bloc agents saying their only aim was getting 
money from the americans 
the agencys report said conrad tricked the brothers by 
inventing a man named mike who provided information from the north 
atlantic treaty organization and saying he needed money to pay the 
fictitious agent 
according to the charges the kercsik brothers were couriers in 
europe for conrad who sold nato secrets to hungary 
hungary enlisted the elder brother in the 1960s and the younger 
in 1980 they told the court and they were pressured by agents who 
constantly reminded them of their sister and ailing mother in 
hungary 
they have denied espionage charges claiming they did not 
collect secret material but only acted as couriers the defense 
says they did not operate in sweden and their activities were not 
directed against this neutral nation

israel inoculated more than 500000 residents 
against polio monday on the second day of a nationwide vaccination 
campaign that began after nine cases of the paralyzing disease were 
diagnosed 
israeli television meanwhile reported that two infants from 
northern israel were hospitalized with symptoms of the disease 
their diagnosis has not yet been confirmed hospital officials said 
polio was thought to be eradicated in the region and the recent 
cases have been blamed on inadequate sewage systems 
health ministry spokesman shmuel algrabli said 14 million 
israelis have been inoculated since the country was alerted last 
month 
the armys civil administration began vaccinating palestinian 
residents of the occupied west bank and gaza strip sunday algrabli 
said 
there have been no problems with the intefadeh in this 
regard he said referring to the 10monthold palestinian revolt 
against israeli rule we have had the complete cooperation of the 
residents and the physicians 
no figure was available on the number of arab residents 
inoculated 
the campaign to encompass 32 million israelis under 40 years 
of age and more than 1 million palestinians in the same age group 
is expected to be over in four weeks 
tourists planning to visit israel do not need an extra polio 
vaccination but those now in the country may be inoculated free of 
charge the health ministry said

publisher malcolm stevenson forbes as 
usual made forbes magazines list of the 400 richest people in 
america and as usual he chose not to disclose his own wealth 
forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret and 
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know 
where he falls on the list 
saying no official wealth estimate is available the magazine 
has made him no 113 on the list between laszlo nandor tauber 
worth 500 million and john thomas lupton worth 480 million 
but really how much is he worth 
one thing i can say for sure hes definitely worth between 
225 million and 6 billion said harold seneker a forbes editor 
being publisher has its privileges for the far hills 
millionorbillionaire in short he doesnt publish how much hes 
worth because he doesnt have to 
there is no dollar figure for him simply because he feels 
its his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his 
net worth said forbes spokesman ray healey he just chooses to 
keep it to himself 
but really how much is he worth 
i dont think he even knows what it is and i dont think hes 
in any hurry to have it figured out said don garson director of 
corporate communications for forbes 
it would be unfair to forbes to print his worth garson said 
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are 
presumed estimated and forbes would be presumed factual since it 
is his magazine 
while the oct 24 issue includes outsiders estimates of forbes 
worth they range dramatically the london daily mail guesses 400 
million newsday estimates his worth between 400 million and 700 
million and new yorks daily news simply says hes a

secretary of state george p shultz on 
monday warned america to steer clear of protectionism and 
isolation which he said is an ingredient in a recipe for 
economic and political disaster not success 
shultz said the concept of democratic and free market values is 
taking hold in latin america asia and africa and the failure of 
the socialist command model has become plain to everybody 
the tide of marxism and with it communism as a model for 
development is a tide that is going out he told the financial 
executives institute 
shultz said he was surprised but pleased with a call for a freer 
economy by the new chief ideologist in the soviet union 
i had to keep pinching myself this is a communist talking 
he said 
but shultz said the words he says are important words 
shultz referred to a speech by vadim a medvedev published last 
week in pravda in which the kremlin ideologist called for 
borrowing ideas from the west in order to restructure the soviet 
economy 
medvedev spoke of expanding to heavy industry the experiments 
already under way on cooperatives and rentals for farmers and small 
entrepreneurs 
shultz related the soviet officials statement to a worldwide 
expansion of the open market system and in an obvious nod to the 
soviet unions glasnost or openness reform policy the 
secretary used the english word himself some halfdozen times 
the big communist countries china and the soviet union are 
also discovering these truths he said 
we will welcome the actions and ideas of others on the world 
stage whether developed or developing capitalist or communist 
if they are pared to promoting openness and world economic 
growth he said 
shultz in a swipe at the stifling regulatory overlay on much 
of europe added it would be a tragic irony for a group of 
nations to create a common market among themselves and then erect 
new trade barriers against countries outside its bounds 
reminding the financial officers that the world economy cannot 
get along without the united states and the economic clout it 
represents shultz added in order to ensure continued national 
and global economic expansion the us budget and trade deficits 
must shrink the sooner the better 
he counseled not to forget that the wealth and size of our 
market are vital to many countries and to the world economy 
american purchases of manufactured goods from developing countries 
nearly doubled between 1982 and 1986 from 41 billion to 81 
billion

an official said monday the 
government will not send delegates to a panama canal commission 
meeting because the united states invited an ambassador loyal to 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
oyden ortega one of four panamanian delegates to the 
commission said the united states also denied entry visas for two 
delegates to attend the oct 1213 meeting in new orleans 
ortega told a news conference the united states had invited juan 
b sosa whom it recognizes as panamas ambassador to washington 
to the meeting 
he said sosas presence introduces an element of politics into 
the canal commission meetings and an institutional meeting would 
have been preferable 
ortega called the invitation one more maneuver by the us 
government to impede the adequate execution of the panama canal 
treaties 
he said panama would send a document to us commission members 
stating that its decision to boycott the meeting did not affect 
panamas compliance with canal treaty obligations 
at no time is panama abandoning its responsibility in 
commission matters he said 
the commission oversees administration of the canal until dec 
31 1999 when panama is to assume full responsibility for the 
waterway that connects that atlantic and pacific oceans 
sosa served as panamas envoy under delvalle who was deposed in 
february after he tried to fire gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega panamas de facto ruler as head of the defense forces is 
under us indictment on drug trafficking charges noriega denies 
any wrongdoing 
the reagan administration continues to recognize delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president 
ortega said the united states denied a visa to maj daniel 
delgado panamas executive director for treaty affairs for what 
he called political declarations against the united states 
delegate arnulfo suarez also was denied a us visa but ortega 
declined to say why 
in july panama ordered its commission representatives not to 
attend a scheduled meeting in savannah ga because of us 
sanctions against noriega 
board chairman william gianetti said in july that noriega also 
was upset because the canal board canceled a meeting to be held in 
panama last april 
in the panamanians absence the five american members voted to 
suspend commission regulations calling for at least two of its four 
annual meetings to be held in panama

george bush and michael dukakis courted the support of 
italianamericans in competing columbus day appearances monday that 
left plenty of time to polish their lines in private for this 
weeks second and final presidential campaign debate 
dukakis proposed a plan to make it easier for firsttime home 
buyers to finance their residences before he marched in a columbus 
day parade up fifth avenue in midtown manhattan alongside gov 
mario cuomo new york mayor ed koch and john f kennedy jr 
bush took a turn at a pool table in an italian neighborhood in 
new jersey bouncing the no 4 ball in the corner pocket while the 
morning patrons cheered after that came a speech on crime 
their daily campaign rounds over both men hustled back to their 
political lairs to resume preparations for their primetime debate 
later in the week 
both camps said they expected the 90minute debate to be held at 
9 pm edt thursday night on the campus of ucla and the 
presidential rivals were flying to the west coast on tuesday to 
prepare 
the candidates exuded confidence as they began the final four 
weeks of campaigning which opened with two new polls putting the 
two candidates in a virtual dead heat 
an abc newswashington post poll monday gave bush 50 percent to 
47 percent for dukakis the survey wednesday through sunday of 600 
likely voters had a 5 point margin of error 
the poll also gauged the negative impact of quayle on the 
republican ticket of all the voters surveyed 2 percent said they 
favored dukakis only because they disapproved of sen dan quayle 
the republican vice presidential nominee six percent of the voters 
said they supported dukakis and quayle was the major reason 
a los angeles times released poll results monday showing the 
effects of quayles presence on the gop ticket the two tickets 
were in a virtual dead heat 44 percent for the republicans to 41 
percent for the democrats but bush leads dukakis 4839 if the two 
candidates are presented as running alone 
the weekend survey of 893 registered voters also found that 
dukakis negatives were very high he had a 45 percent unfavorable 
rating compared with 40 percent unfavorable for quayle the 
survey had a fivepoint margin of error on the questions about 
presidential preference 
quayle was in ohio and michigan where he offered another 
refinement of the answer to the question in last weeks debate that 
plagued him what would he do if he suddenly became president 
he said he would make a request to speak to the nation and would 
consult with us allies 
obviously you do different things under an assassination the 
first thing you do in an assassination i would still say a prayer 
for myself and the nation but the first thing you do is you get 
on the phone and call the head of the cia and see what he thinks it 
was you dont convene a cabinet meeting right away quayle said 
you get your secretary of defense your national security 
adviser your secretary of state and meet with them immediately in 
the situation of an illness it would be a different type of 
situation he said 
dukakis attacked bushs record on housing issues in his first 
stop of the day 
george bush has no housing program he has no solutions the 
democrat said in a speech in levittown a long island community 
that was the embodiment of the postworld war ii boom in affordable 
housing he has no new ideas 
the vice president streetcampaigned in new jersey walking 
through an italian neighborhood in south trenton before delivering 
a speech on crime 
he proposed making it easier for victims to collect civil 
judgments for restitution and allowing them to receive more money 
automatically if a convicts financial situation improved 
while refraining from the type of harsh attack on dukakis crime 
record that has become a regular part of his campaigning bush 
criticized liberal thinkers who he said thought it was 
compassionate to lighten up on sentencing to allow early releases 
and furloughs 
that was a muted remark directed at the massachusetts prison 
furlough program that bush has repeatedly criticized during the 
campaign in one infamous incident a murderer out of jail on a 
furlough escaped and brutally attacked a maryland couple 
bush told reporters aboard air force two en route to new jersey 
that he favors a review of the federal furlough program but said he 
doesnt have any specific feelings in mind in a jab at 
dukakis he added he wants to make sure the federal program doesnt 
slip into the massachusetts model 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen jabbed right 
back at bush saying the federal program allowed more than 7000 
convicted drug offenders to receive furloughs last year 
after 2818 days of sitting on the sidelines george bush has 
finally admitted that there is something wrong with a federal 
furlough program that gives 45day vacations to drug traffickers 
bentsen said in washington 
campaigning in levittown dukakis outlined a plan that he dubbed 
home start that would allow firsttime home buyers to use their 
individual retirement account or taxdeferred pension savings for a 
downpayment on a home current law prohibits the use of those funds 
without payment of deferred taxes and in some cases a penalty for 
withdrawal 
dukakis said his program would also include provisions to lower 
down payments and closing costs and to raise borrowing limits on 
federally guaranteed mortgages aides said the federal government 
would lose about 400 million in taxes that under current law would 
have to be paid on iras and pension accounts but would be exempt 
from taxes under the program 
as a sign the dukakis national campaign has lowered its sights 
in florida that states campaign director and political director 
left monday for assignments in ohio eight other staffers have 
already been transferred to ohio or michigan there are no visits 
to florida scheduled for dukakis or bentsen 
but the democratic national committee disputed the claim by 
republican strategists meeting monday in atlanta that the south is 
theirs unless the campaigns become complacent 
theres not a question in my mind that george bush is going to 
win every state in the south bush campaign manager lee atwater 
said in atlanta 
will robinson national political director of the democratic 
national committees campaign 88 said if the republicans want 
to take the south for granted thats fine with us they did that 
two years ago and we won the senate let them do it again this year 
and well take the white house 
robinson pointed to several polls showing democratic candidates 
behind in senate races in 1986

waterway between the two countries be reopened

said both iran and iraq will withdraw their troops to the

a pair of surveys released monday showed the 
republican ticket of george bush and dan quayle ticket in a virtual 
dead heat with democrats michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen and 
quayle was seen as having a negative impact in both surveys 
one of the surveys by the los angeles times also showed that 
dukakis had a comparable negative rating with quayle 
the times survey showed the republican ticket leading the 
democratic ticket 4441 but when bush and dukakis were pitted 
against against each other without their respective running mates 
bush led 4839 a 5 point margin of error closed the difference in 
both cases 
in an abc newswashington post poll bush had 50 percent to 47 
percent for dukakis that survey also had a 5 point margin of error 
the times poll conducted over the weekend by telephone also 
found that texas sen lloyd bentsen far outperformed quayle in last 
weeks vice presidential debate but it also found that dukakis had 
a 45 percent unfavorable rating compared with 40 percent 
unfavorable rating for quayle 
the abcpost poll in an effort to assess the quayle drag 
among the electorate found that 2 percent of all voters supported 
dukakis only because of their negative feelings about quayle and 6 
percent said quayle was the major reason for supporting dukakis 
the abcpost survey of 600 likely voters was conducted 
nationwide by telephone from wednesday through sunday the times 
survey of 893 registered voters was conducted over the weekend

government soldiers fled into uganda on friday when the guerrillas 
captured ikotos a town in eastern equatorial province 46 miles 
from the border 
spla fighters have taken positions on the sudanese side but 
because of the respect we have for international borders we cannot 
cross into uganda the radio monitored in nairobi said 
we urge the fugitives to surrender if they surrender without 
their arms no harm will be done to them 
the radio made no mention of rebel casualties and it was 
immediately impossible to independently verify its report

moslemdominated government in khartoum demanding more autonomy 
for the mainly christian and animist south the rebel movement 
claims control of 90 percent of the southern countryside and small 
towns

a carbon dioxide tank exploded 
at a plant that makes airplane and rocket parts monday killing at 
least two people and injuring seven others authorities said 
the explosion at reinhold industries which is about 15 miles 
southeast of los angeles occurred about 230 pm as employees 
were installing a highpressure molding machine said fire marshal 
stan boettcher several carbon dioxide cylinders were beside the 
building and one or more may have been hooked up to the machine 
he said 
the blast caused telephone and electrical outages said 
sheriffs sgt thomas heller 
the explosion of the colorless odorless gas did not result in a 
fire or further chemical leaks he said 
one portion of the building was totally demolished where the 
equipment went through part of the roof said boettcher he added 
that unseasonable temperatures in the high 90s didnt appear to 
have contributed to the explosion 
heat is developed in their manufacturing process so i dont 
think climatic heat had anything to do with it 
boettcher said the company made airplane propellers and nose 
caps and nose cones for rockets and aircraft 
about 580 customers were briefly without electricity after the 
blast said pat messigian a southern california edison

nearly 500 physicians and others in a letter 
sent to president reagan on monday called for an executive order 
banning the use of intentionally aborted fetal tissue for research 
the plea came 10 days before a national institutes of health 
special advisory committee meets to finalize its recommendations on 
the controversial subject 
although its actions at a threeday meeting last month were 
informal the discussions and a series of straw votes left no 
doubt even among opponents that a majority of the 21member 
panel will formally recommend going ahead with such research 
however the advisory committee will not officially forward its 
recommendations to a standing nih ethics committee until nov 15 
a week after the presidential election and it is unlikely any 
recommendations will make their way up through the federal health 
bureauracy until after a new president takes office 
at least some officials in the white house are pushing for an 
early order from reagan regardless of what the nih panel 
recommends 
a week before the advisory committees first meeting last month 
copies of a proposed executive order accompanied by a memo from 
white house domestic adviser gary bauer were obtained by reporters 
in his memo bauer told health and human services secretary otis 
r bowen he wanted his comments on the friday before the fetal 
tissue panel began its deliberations the following wednesday 
bowen said he had no intention of making a recommendation before 
the matter was fully studied including by the advisory committee 
appointed by nih director james wyngaarden on orders of dr robert 
e windom the no 2 official in bowens department 
referring to the proposed white house draft that became public 
last month the letter sent to reagan on monday said 
the proposed executive order is we believe superbly crafted 
in its moral perspective with its clear recognition of the inherent 
dignity of the human fetus 
we are convinced that it responsibly addresses the looming 
abuses of a crass pragmatism which would reduce the human fetus to 
a research object for the convenience of other human beings and 
medical experimentation

physician walker percy author nat hentoff and former education

leaders of the paperworkers union told 
grimfaced members monday they were abruptly ending a bitter 
16monthold strike against international paper co mills by 2300 
workers in three states 
the union said the move will give strikers first crack at any 
jobs vacated by nonunion employees who now run the mills in jay 
de pere wis and lock haven pa 
this stage of the war is over we have lost this battle but 
the war for justice in the work place is not over said felix 
jacques executive vice president of united paperworkers 
international union local 14 in jay 
local union presidents from the three mills reached their 
decision sunday after a weekend of private meetings at union 
headquarters in nashville tenn union officials said the company 
was informed by telegram sunday 
the workers including 1200 at the jay plant went on strike 
june 16 1987 when the union rejected a concessionary contract 
the company imposed the contract and kept the plants open with 
replacement workers 
about 720 union members went on strike at the pennsylvania 
plant and 350 were on strike in wisconsin 
a mill spokesman at the jay plant said the union members by 
calling off the strike gained the right to be given first 
preference for any openings but he said the mill was at full 
complement and hires new employees at an average rate of only 
three per week 
as openings occur we will welcome workers who have been on 
strike who qualify for those openings said richard white 
stressing that none of the replacement workers would be asked to 
leave 
during the strike this central maine town of 4000 has been the 
scene of boisterous rallies and marches as well as occasional 
violence and vandalism that led to court orders limiting activities 
on the picket line a series of chemical leaks and onthejob 
accidents at the mill heightened tensions in recent months with 
the union blaming the problems on the inexperience of the new 
workers 
the unions decision to end the strike does not affect the 
companys mobile ala mill where more than 1000 union members 
have been locked out the union had sought to consolidate the labor 
disputes at the four mills but with little success 
international paper one of the largest paper companies in the 
world has said that the strike has had little effect on production 
jacques said the unions national leadership had left the local 
presidents no choice he said it was clear the national union could 
not provide the support needed to continue the strike much longer 
strikers had been receiving 55 a week in strike benefits 
some of the strikers in jay many of whom earned more than 
35000 a year at the plant took other jobs during the prolonged 
strike 
jacques announced the end of the strike to reporters and about 
80 somber union members at the union hall where a sign out front 
read stand tall we will all go back together 
although the union has taken no position on whether members 
should return to the mill he said we will stand here in total 
support of anyone who goes into that mill 
said striker roland samson its not that we dont want to 
fight its just that we cant we have nothing to fight with 
maine gov john r mckernan whose vetoes of legislation 
supported by organized labor made him a lightning rod for the 
strikers anger called the jay situation a tragedy he 
reiterated his view that the strikers were pawns in a fight between 
an international company and an international union 
i believe this would have been resolved if the dispute had 
remained at the local level mckernan said we just werent 
calling our own shots either at the management level or the 
union level 
an election to decertify the paperworkers union as the 
bargaining agent for mill employees has already been held in de 
pere and the results are under challenges by both the union and 
management similar elections are anticipated at the other two 
mills the strikers automatically lose the right to vote in such 
elections after one year on the picket line

a page the size of a door from a 550yearold 
manuscript copy of the koran the sacred book of moslems sold for 
272745 monday at sothebys auctioneers 
the page measuring 6 feet by 37 feet came from a work 
commissioned by prince baysanghur of the persian timurid dynasty to 
embellish the tomb in samarkand of his grandfather timur the 
mighty mongol conqueror known in the west as tamerlane or 
tamburlaine 
before the sale appraisers estimated the page would fetch up to 
60000 pounds 102600 in mondays auction in london of oriental 
manuscripts and miniatures said a sothebys spokeswoman who spoke 
on condition she not be indentified 
the middle eastern buyer of the manuscript page wanted to remain 
anonymous she said 
sothebys said only two other pages of this size from the 
manuscript are known both owned by private collectors 
the page sold monday contained a sevenline fragment in arabic 
of two of the korans 6236 verses it read as for those their 
portion of the book shall reach them until our messengers come to 
them causing them to die 
scholars doubt whether a complete version of the manuscript was 
ever completed because the project was so huge the spokeswoman 
said a complete volume of the manuscript would have been 3500 
pages long 
nabil saidi sothebys expert on oriental manuscripts said 
nobody knows why it is so big but it may have been just for the 
grandeur the lavishness of it the prince wanted to impress

the roundtable talks between communist 
authorities and the opposition could last three to four weeks and 
should focus on basic issues of political and economic reform a 
politburo member said monday 
in an interview with the staterun news agency pap jozef czyrek 
said the talks would be held in the latter half of this month 
but gave no date last week opposition mediator andrzej 
stelmachowski said they were tentatively set for oct 17 
czyrek said the talks should aim for an agreement on a 
proreform coalition that would help work out and implement reforms 
agreed upon at the roundtable 
czyrek did not mention the banned labor movement solidarity by 
name but said agreement on a model for trade union activity in 
poland would be an important aspect of the talks 
another key task would consist in arriving at joint 
conclusions on accelerating economic reform and consequently 
working out a polish economic model as well as reaching agreement 
on the matter of the trade union model in poland pap quoted him 
as saying 
solidarity leaders met over the weekend and agreed that 
legalizing the movement was essential if the talks were to succeed 
a solidarity communique said 
the statement was issued by solidarity national spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz and was released monday 
it also said more than 100 people were fired from their jobs 
after the august strikes and that stopping all the repressions is 
a necessary condition to create the atmosphere of good will during 
the coming talks 
authorities agreed to talks with the opposition during a 19day 
wave of strikes in august polands worst labor strife in seven 
years 
onyszkiewicz also said monday that a statement he made at a us 
congressional hearing last month concerning human rights in poland 
should be published in the polish press 
he was responding to a statement by a foreign ministry spokesman 
on sunday that his appearance before congress had done some 
harm to poland abroad 
last week the government said a prosecutor would look at the 
statement to see if polish law was violated 
onyszkiewicz said the helsinki commission of congress invited 
him to talk about human rights in poland and he told the group when 
he appeared sept 23 that polish authorities did not respect rights 
guaranteed by international conventions 
he said in a prepared statement monday that he demanded 
publication of the full text of his testimony before congress in 
the mass media as well as questions and answers polish society 
will be able then to judge the groundlessness of accusations and 
only then it will appear who serves whom

washington where the windchill at the summit was 17 below zero in 
the morning 
fish and game officials and volunteers had organized search 
parties for the three who had no rain gear or warm clothes after 
a fourth companion had turned back and reported the situation to 
officials

it was fine then two minutes later there were 60 mph winds 
and heavy snow he said the snow was up to my chin all the way 
down

dollar bills to keep it going they resumed their hike down the 
mountain about 8 am

aldo went to jail maurizio became a 
fugitive paolo claimed his relatives beat him 
the guccis creators of some of fashions bestknown status 
symbols have known constant trouble as a result of family feuds 
now there are signs that peace is returning to the luxury goods 
company but as a result of the turmoil the company held tightly 
by generations of male guccis now is halfowned by arabs run by a 
team of mbas and headed by a woman 
the woman is marina martellini a 48yearold former professor 
of economics at milans bocconi school one of italys leading 
business institutions 
of the guccis only ashes remain laments giorgio gucci the 
firms honorary president 
gucci was one of the pioneers of the international italian 
fashion boom combining centuriesold florentine artisanship with 
modern snob appeal 
that recipe won it a following among such stylesetters as 
actress audrey hepburn princess grace of monaco and jacqueline 
onassis 
money has been no object to customers who have snapped up 
everything from a 11 bar of soap to a 50000 handsewn alligator 
trunk 
the people in the market want gucci notes enrico cucchiani 
the companys managing director unfortunately theres this 
gucci dynasty side to the story 
the company was founded in 1922 by guccio gucci a leather goods 
salesman who emphasized florentine quality and tight family control 
of the business 
it was with some reluctance that he watched his son aldo expand 
overseas a drive that has resulted in 180 stores and about 82 
percent of the parent companys sales today 
aldo nonetheless maintained many of his fathers principles 
bringing his sons giorgio paolo and roberto and his nephew 
maurizio into the executive ranks 
the wellheeled gucci image suffered its first jolt when paolo 
proposed more inexpensive products and licensing and his relatives 
opposed the plans 
the disagreement exploded into an argument at a 1982 board 
meeting and according to a suit filed by paolo his relatives 
smashed a tape recorder over his head 
they denied the charge and the case was eventually dismissed 
in a subsequent lawsuit by paolo charging that his family had 
blocked his efforts to trade under his own name produced documents 
alleging that his father 81yearold aldo evaded taxes in the 
united states the suit was dismissed but the us internal 
revenue service picked up on the documents and in january 1986 
aldo pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a federal court in 
new york city he was sentenced to a year in prison but was allowed 
to serve part of his sentence at a halfway house in west palm 
beach fla 
gucci relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart 
the family and the firm it had built 
the company was a part of my life says giorgio paolos 
older brother i had always smelled the perfume of leather had 
always watched my grandfather in the shop in florence working with 
so much energy 
in 1984 maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize 
control and oust aldo the young bespectacled maurizio brought in 
a new team of managers 
the board decided the company had to be professionally 
managed explains cucchiani one of the young americaneducated 
executives 
but older family members saw it differently 
maurizio wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm says 
his cousin giorgio 
peace did not reign for long maurizios relatives alleged that 
the papers giving him half the company on his fathers death in 
1983 had forged signatures maurizios shares were frozen 
based on his relatives charges courts in florence and milan 
charged maurizio with exporting capital and evading taxes an 
arrest warrant was issued and maurizio took refuge in switzerland 
to replace him stateappointed custodians of his shares 
appointed a milan business professor maria martellini 
a new era has begun martellini says the company has a 
place in the market that is more important than the specific 
problems of the gucci family 
under its new management the company has launched a program to 
expand production standardize the quality of its stores and trim 
its product line which had expanded beyond leather goods to 
100000 items 
sales increased by nearly 4 percent from 2297 billion lire in 
1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 about 170 million at current 
exchange rates 
guccio guccis linked initials still adorn the firms handbags 
luggage and scarves and in workshops in florence apronclad 
artisans cut black and cobaltblue alligator skins and guide 
handbags through sewing machines 
but the guccis are nearly gone from gucci 
last spring giorgio and his brothers roberto and paulo decided 
to sell most of their shares in the company the purchaser was 
investcorp an arab investment bank 
while a judge ruled in july that 40yearold maurizio could 
return to italy his shares are frozen if he loses his court 
cases he may have to sell some 
giorgio says he parted with his shares because the new 
management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional 
standards 
the new managers however insist the company will continue to 
reflect the vision of guccio gucci 
there is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and 
feuds says cucchiani the strength is the consumer who wants 
this brand the strength is also with the people who work with the 
company that want the gucci splendor and the artisans that want 
that splendor 
the name has got a magic connotation

the quandary facing britains labor 
party emerged starkly at its recent annual convention here how to 
broaden its appeal without seeming to clutch at prime minister 
margaret thatchers coattails 
splits were apparent across the spectrum at one end was bryan 
gould the polished collegeeducated labor campaign manager 
pleading for more openness to market forces at the other was 
miners leader arthur scargill ridiculing labors leadership as 
yuppies and capitalists 
speaker after speaker rose to level roughly the same accusation 
that by diluting its leftwing doctrines the labor party was 
simply trying to copy mrs thatchers conservatives 
i didnt join the party to have a yuppified approach to run 
capitalism better than the tories grumbled scargill during the 
weeklong conference in early october 
but labor has lost three elections in a row to mrs thatcher 
since 1979 and has lurched further left in opposition so when 
party leader neil kinnock spoke of the need for realism he meant 
recognizing the irrevocable change wrought by nearly 10 years of 
mrs thatchers rigorous brand of conservatism 
the kind of economy we are faced with is a market economy 
and we have got to run it better than the tories kinnock told 
delegates in this north england resort there is no concession to 
thatcherism as great as letting it win again 
on the economy kinnock succeeded in edging the party to the 
right with broad endorsement for the first stage of a twoyear 
reform package 
but to his dismay the big bluecollar unions used their 
overwhelming voting power to narrowly reaffirm the partys most 
proven voteloser unilateral nuclear disarmament 
it is a decision kinnock signaled he may ignore when the 
conference votes next year on the final version of a new platform 
to try to win again in a changed nation 
the fact is that in britain stockholders have trebled in number 
to 9 million since 1979 roughly equal to the number of labor union 
members 
the trades union congress the national labor federation is 
down from 122 million members in 1979 to 91 million this summer 
smokestack industries such as that stateowned british steel 
which now is being readied for privatization have shed thousands 
of workers in thatcherordered shakeups 
the manufacturing industry now employs 5 million people 2 
million fewer than in 1979 service industries often 
nonunionized employ 15 million up 200000 
the economy is growing at 4 percent a year faster than most 
other industrialized countries fueled by creditcard buying that 
has sent the trade deficit heading toward 20 billion this year 
four times higher than originally estimated 
but opinion polls indicate that most britons still feel better 
off and doubt the labor party can preserve their prosperity 
twothirds of britons own their homes up from 50 percent when 
mrs thatcher came to power and enabled tenants mostly 
bluecollar to buy statesubsidized houses the laborites 
initially opposed the policy but now espouse it 
kinnock wants to ready labor for the next general election 
probably in 1991 but the conference left question marks over how 
far the party will let him go 
the unions block votes helped kinnock crush a leftwing bid to 
unseat him and adopt the firststage policy reforms these include 
jettisoning commitments to renationalize all stateowned industries 
sold by mrs thatcher and to repeal all her unioncurbing laws 
but the resentments conflicts and class overtones burst through 
when ron todd leader of the powerful 125 millionmember transport 
and general workers union turned against the leadership calling 
it all sharp suits and cordless telephones clipboards and 
scientific samples 
todd a workingclass cockney further embarrassed kinnock by 
using his unions block vote to kill an attempt to water down the 
pledge of unilateral nuclear disarmament 
it illustrated labors main problem the party is funded by the 
unions that founded it in 1900 but the very power the union bosses 
exercise 90 percent of the conference voting strength portrays 
labor as a prisoner of trade union militancy 
todd 61 characterizes an old and shrinking workingclass 
constituency 
kinnock a welsh miners son is a university graduate and at 
46 a generation away from his workingclass origins 
gavin laird moderate leader of the engineers union saw the 
kinnocktodd battle as hastening the day when labor governments 
finally disengage from the unions 
come the day when we have the next labor government there 
will be no tea and cookies at downing street any more he said 
we will have a healthy armslength relationship

when marisa fernandez de sanda went to a 
doctor in 1981 to complain about terrible itching and aches all 
over her body she was told these were normal signs of spring 
but as spring turned to summer and her condition grew worse the 
25yearold mother of a small son and a baby began to think about 
the fivequart plastic jug of bargain olive oil she bought on 
the advice of a neighbor and the news she was seeing on television 
about people dying from something called atypical pneumonia 
eventually more than 700 people would be dead and 25000 others 
would become mysteriously ill 
marisa fernandez was one who became ill 
i had always bought sunflower oil but after my second 
pregnancy the doctor recommended olive oil she said in a recent 
interview in her home in the province of madrid so when my 
neighbor said she knew a man who was selling it real cheap i 
thought heres a bargain 
her friend clara burgues de dominguez bought three jugs of the 
oil at a street market because her husband was unemployed and 
every peseta counts when youre trying to make ends meet 
in july 1981 both marisa fernandez and clara burgues were 
admitted to the hospital and told they were suffering from what had 
gone from atypical pneumonia to a mysterious toxic syndrome 
that developed from the oil the two women thought was olive oil but 
in fact allegedly was rapeseed oil processed for industrial use 
not for human consumption 
the state brought 38 defendants to trial on charges of 
involvement in the import refining and sale of the oil 
fifteen months of hearings ended in june but the verdict of the 
threejudge tribunal is not expected for six months possibly a 
year 
the state claims the oil was the cause of the deaths and the 
illness that affects the respiratory system nerves joints and 
muscles 
i used the oil for everything making stews frying meat and 
potatoes salads making mayonnaise marisa fernandez said i 
loved to dip bread in it when i was cooking and eat it on the 
spot 
her husband juan and son david fell ill briefly but were not 
hospitalized the baby did not become ill but was without his 
mother for the first six months of his life something juan sanda 
thinks was equally as serious 
the first time i was hospitalized for 25 days my weight had 
fallen from 56 to 43 kilos 123 to 94 pounds marisa fernandez 
said i was in a room with about 25 other women and they pumped 
us full of pills and shots every day someone would leave and we 
would know they had died 
said clara burgues when the pain got too bad we would grab 
on to lamp posts when we were walking in the street 
when we went to the hospital they treated us like guinea 
pigs they didnt know what to do with us how to treat us what to 
treat us for they didnt have enough beds so they processed us 
through real quick then we just had to be readmitted again when it 
became unbearable 
marisa fernandez returned to the hospital in september 1981 
unable to use her hands or feet or to feed herself 
i had no appetite and all around me people particularly 
young girls were dying 
at 33 after three years of acupuncture and continuing twice 
weekly physical therapy sessions with other toxic syndrome 
sufferers she still has frequent cramps and little feeling on the 
right side of her body 
she can no longer type and cant work outside her home and 
receives from the government a monthly disability pension the 
equivalent of 270 
there is something all those affected seem to feel she 
said looking at a photograph of herself emaciated in a bathing 
suit following her hospitalization we all carry the disease on 
our faces like a shadow 
although the spanish press and most of those affected by the 
toxic syndrome blame the oil for the illness clara burgues is not 
so sure 
when i testified at the trial they asked me to say whether i 
believed the oil was the cause of my problems i told them how did 
they expect me a housewife from a lowermiddle class neighborhood 
to answer that question i told them of 28 people among my 
neighbors who all used the oil i was the only one who got sick 
but then they all ate tomatoes too 
that was a reference to the claim of some defense attorneys that 
the illness was due to organophosphate pesticides used on tomatoes 
grown in southeastern spain around almeria 
dr richard doll chief pathologist for britains imperial 
cancer research fund testified at the trial that the oil was the 
cause of the illness researchers from the centers for disease 
control in atlanta and the european branch office of the world 
health organization agreed with dolls finding 
both marisa fernandez and clara burgues say they are not sure 
they will ever get out from under the shadow of the mysterious 
illness 
when it first struck we were treated like lepers by neighbors

premier andreas papandreou came through 
openheart surgery in london but politicians here at home are 
already discussing what they call the postpapandreou era 
the 69yearold socialist leader had a heart valve replaced and 
triple bypass surgery in a sevenhour operation sept 30 
but the health problems together with his plans to divorce his 
american wife and marry a 34yearold greek airline stewardess 
suggest to some politicians that papandreou is likely to put his 
private life ahead of politics in future 
the papandreou government has been a oneman show with him 
unfit its hard to see how the socialists are going to carry on 
said dimitris nianias a member of parliament from the small 
liberal democratic renewal party 
leading personalities in papandreous panhellenic socialist 
movement pasok are already cautiously lobbying to stand in for 
or to even succeed the premier if he steps down 
elections are due in eight months but with a weakened leader 
pasok may find it hard to repeat the easy victories of 1981 and 
1985 
papandreou will come back from london a hero and the 
government will muddle along for the next few months said 
political columnist haris bousbourelis but after that will 
people really be prepared to vote for a sick man 
pasok could have an indian summer but the feeling around 
athens is that the socialist era is coming to an end 
a us citizen for more than 20 years and an economics professor 
at the university of minnesota and the university of california at 
berkley papandreou swept to power in 1981 on an antiamerican 
antinato platform pledging a socialist transformation of 
greece after a generation of rightwing rule 
the pledge failed to materialize but the charismatic premier 
kept voters loyalty despite reversing his promises to shut down 
us military bases and loosen greek ties with the west pasok won 
a second fouryear term in the 1985 election with 46 percent of the 
vote down from 48 percent in 1981 
papandreous autocratic style has triggered charges from 
opposition conservatives that the socialists practice 
parliamentary tyranny leftwingers accuse him of betraying his 
radical past and backsliding into social democracy 
his muchpublicized relationship with dimitra liani the airline 
stewardess is likely to have a negative effect on the socialists 
popularity according to other politicians 
the tall blond ms liani stayed with papandreou in london 
cooking his favorite greek food and posing for photographers in 
the hospital corridors his american wife margaret did not go 
there 
there is a broad margin of tolerance about these things in 
greece said leonidas kyrkos who heads the small greek left 
party but people already think the dimitra affair has damaged 
the countrys image and there will be real trouble if she seems to 
be actively involving herself in politics 
socialist officials said that even if his recovery stays on 
track papandreou will have a sharply reduced workload in the 
coming months 
the officials said the premier will handle only pressing foreign 
policy issues like the us bases negotiations and a delicate 
10monthold rapprochement with fellow natomember turkey after 
years of rivalry over control of the aegean sea 
the bases negotiations are stalling over greek insistence that 
the highprofile us air force base at athens airport close down 
after the current agreement runs out in december 
domestic issues such as a sagging economy a 14 percent 
inflation rate and huge deficits along with grassroots 
preparation for next years election campaign will be left to 
trusted aides the officials said 
in keeping with his personalized style of rule papandreou 
refused to name a standin during his absence cabinet ministers 
have been flying to london for instructions and the conservative 
opposition has charged the premier was trying to fill a power 
vacuum with government by telefax 
to avoid the suggestion that he was appointing a successor 
papandreou asked both deputy premiers yiannis haralambopoulos and 
agamemnon koutsogiorgas to supervise daytoday running of the 
government 
papandreou hasnt given any hints about who might eventually 
succeed him as pasok leader but koutsogiorgas 69 the premiers 
personal lawyer and his closest political confidant is considered 
the strongest contender 
pasoks membership includes oldfashioned centrists ambitious 
technocrats and radical leftwingers who are likely to clash if 
papandreou steps down papandreou founded the party in 1974 and has 
always kept a tight grip on its decisionmaking 
there is speculation too that koutsogiorgas might eventually 
hand over the socialist leadership to 36yearold george 
papandreou the premiers son and current education minister 
keeping alive the family political dynasty 
the premier got his start in politics when his father centrist 
premier george papandreou appointed him to a cabinet job in 1963

this long island sound community is 
exploding with things oneill it is the focus for celebrations to 
commemorate the centennial of the playwright eugene oneill a 
nobel and pulitzer prizewinner who summered in new london as a 
child and young writer 
after months of hard work sculptor norman legassie will share 
the limelight with oneill who was born 100 years ago on oct 16 
1888 legassie has sculpted a bronze statue based on a famous 
photograph of the playwright the work will be unveiled during 
ceremonies in new london on oct 16 
the photograph shows a 7yearold oneill dressed in his sunday 
best holding an open book while sitting on a rock overlooking new 
london harbor the photograph was apparently taken near monte 
cristo cottage a home used by the oneill family during the 
summers of 1889 to 1915 
the sculpture was assembled at a rhode island foundry and will 
be placed atop a huge boulder at the foot of the city pier 
it has considerable meaning to it its creating its own 
meaning legassie said 
new london has had a lovehate affair with the playwright for 
years 
to some in new london theres no doubt that oneill should be 
celebrated they note that hes the only american dramatist to have 
won the nobel prize for literature and four pulitzer prizes also 
oneill did some early writing while in the city and featured some 
of the citys residents in his plays 
but there also were those in new london who recalled oneill as 
a harddrinking young man who ran with the wrong crowd and while 
he based some of the characters in his plays on the citys leading 
citizens the depictions were often unflattering 
the two visions of oneill clashed in 1972 when the city 
recognized its local celebrity and named its main street in his 
honor sharp criticism of the playwright surfaced during the debate 
over renaming the street mayor thomas j griffin stood to oppose 
the propsal calling oneill a stew bum 
the monte cristo cottage is maintained as a museum and listed on 
the national historic register a short distance from the cottage 
in waterford there is the eugene oneill theater both the theater 
and museum have participated in the yearlong centennial 
celebration 
the cottage was the setting for ah wilderness and long 
days journey into night moon for the misbegotten was also 
set in new london 
the oneills first visited new london in 1883 at the insistence 
of a family friend they liked it and a year later bought a summer 
home here it was the only true home the family had since james 
oneill the father was a traveling actor 
as eugene grew older though some frictions developed more 
wealthy and aristocratic families from new york and boston had 
settled in new london which became a wellknown resort town 
eugene cemented his reputation as a stew bum in 1912 after 
his failed first marriage he went to work for a local newspaper 
covering news and writing poetry he spent his salary at local bars 
and was a wellknown womanizer this led to friction with some of 
the towns more upstanding citizens he made matters worse by 
taking considerable pleasure in living up to his rogue reputation 
his newspaper job ended in the fall when he contracted tuberculosis 
oneill told acquaintances that new london wasnt a friendly 
town and that he disliked it but his actions spoke otherwise as 
he grew famous he maintained close contacts with new london 
friends and inquired about events in the town 
yale university where oneill donated his papers presented 
some of his plays last fall while connecticut college and lyman 
allyn museum in new london also have participated in the marking of 
oneills 100th birthday with exhibits of eugene oneill photos and 
memorabilia 
there also will be tours of new london the oneill homes and 
eugene oneill theater as well as a centennial ball and celebrity 
cocktail party with actress dina merrill and actor jason robards as 
honorary chairmen 
in addition local residents have helped organize a weeklong 
celebration that will end oct 16 with a parade and unveiling of 
the statue 
the bronze figure will be slightly larger than life 1125 times 
as large to be exact legassie used a 7yearold boy to model for 
the statue and then set out to bring three dimensions to the old 
blackandwhite photograph 
it has been a considerable challenge since this is the first 
major work the 37yearold artist has done on his own he 
previously worked with adlai hardin sculpting three lifesize 
figures of st paul st peter and st jude at st patricks 
cathedral in new york city 
the project seemed very interesting to me in that it was 
eugene oneill and im familiar with him and his works since its 
a local project i felt even more drawn to it said legassie who 
lives in old lyme 
the bulk of legassies work was making the statue itself but 
two other major obstacles were finding a boulder similar to the one 
in the photograph and locating a site for the statue 
legassie was unable to locate the rock shown in the photograph 
and failed to find a good replacement in new london a friend 
knowing of his problem invited him to look in her back yard in old 
lyme near the connecticut river there he found just what he was 
looking for a 5ton boulder with a lot of character that was 
hauled to new london 
the rock has been placed near the city pier a site where many 
people will be able to see the statue 
the longrange benefit of this is new london with the arts 
community said michael lamparelli director of the marine 
commerce and development committee eugene oneill was one of the 
lost sons for a long time

with a 169percent 
unemployment rate britains highest by far northern ireland 
desperately needs jobs as an antidote to its conflict and it goes 
to extraordinary lengths to attract outside investment to create 
them 
but as the province marks its 20th anniversary of political and 
sectarian violence obstacles persist 
these include a disinvestment movement in the united states the 
potential hassle factor of new employment laws designed to 
combat job discrimination against the roman catholic minority and 
northern irelands violent image 
to compensate local businessmen have used sheer persistence and 
the government has resorted to enticements such as rentfree 
factories and hefty matching funds to attract foreign 
manufacturers and they have achieved a small measure of success 
it is very very difficult said bob nicholson manager of 
du ponts chemical plant near londonderry 
entrepreneur jim bloomer recalls his difficulties in getting 
neotech industries a maker of electronic pressure gauges based in 
dallas to set up a joint manufacturing venture 
i made 21 journeys to the states bloomer said they were 
most definitely not interested in northern ireland at that time 
perseverance succeeded for this antrim businessman who said 
with obvious pride about northern irelands newest american 
investment we have people here who have never worked before 
michael bohill an executive director of the governments 
industrial development board in belfast said our aim is to 
create longterm employment opportunities in northern ireland that 
is a social as well as an economic challenge 
a slump in manufacturing industries has left 117000 jobless in 
northern ireland the catholic male unemployment rate is 2 times 
higher than the protestant rate and the job scarcity fosters an 
atmosphere in which catholic and protestant armed groups flourish 
one sides gain is quite definitely another sides loss this 
is a difficulty we all face said a government official who 
requested anonymity saying his life recently was threatened 
not everybody is convinced that jobs are the answer 
in fact sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed 
irish republican army believes the creation of more catholic jobs 
will prompt more violence 
sinn fein spokesman jackie donnelly said that while he welcomes 
more jobs for catholics he believes they anger protestants who 
feel the employment opportunities should go to them these 
protestants donnelly added retaliate by physically attacking 
catholics 
the ira is fighting to oust britain from northern ireland 
officially the province of ulster and unite it with the republic 
of ireland to the south critics maintain the real reason for sinn 
feins stance is the fear that jobs mean normality and normality 
entrenches british rule 
northern ireland relies heavily on outside investment which 
accounts for 35000 or onethird of the provinces 105000 
manufacturing jobs 
americans are the largest outside investors with 26 us 
companies employing 10000 workers or about 10 percent of the 
manufacturing work force 
the importance of american investment to northern ireland 
cannot be overstated said the government official 
but now american investors are being frightened off by the 
movement in the united states calling for disinvestment to punish 
what it sees as bias against catholics who represent 40 percent of 
the population of 16 million 
since 1986 11 us states have enacted legislation inspired by 
the late irish statesman sean macbrides fair employment 
principles and the british government has mounted a concerted 
lobbying campaign to prevent the trend from spreading 
the macbride principles call for disinvestment measures against 
companies in northern ireland that fail to operate by a code of 
antidiscrimination measures which include affirmative action and 
personal protection for workers 
more states are considering such legislation which is being 
promoted by irishamerican politicians and pressure groups and 
which sinn fein supports 
we expect to face challenges in quite a number of states 
said simon johnston of ulsters department of economic development 
we could have had more american funds and we have not got them 
and macbride is part of the reason said the departments gerry 
lavery 
the british government has sought to counter the disinvestment 
drive with its own laws against job discrimination which take 
effect next year 
these will force companies to monitor the religious makeup of 
their work forces and demonstrate that they are trying to recruit 
among minority groups offenders will face fines and denial of 
government contracts 
the macbride principles are credited with spurring this action 
which the government says makes the principles redundant but there 
are concerns that these will only magnify the hassle factor 
people say to hell with this well go to holland said 
du ponts nicholson 
ford the us automaker was targeted by an irishamerican 
boycott in 1986 over the lack of catholics in the management of its 
northern ireland operations ford had to mount a fullscale 
investigation which resulted in an admission that catholics were 
underrepresented and a promise of corrective action 
sinn fein excepted all northern irelands parties oppose the 
disinvestment campaign including the social democratic and labor 
party the largest catholic party which argues that since 
unemployment breeds violence nothing should be allowed to hinder 
job creation regardless of who benefits catholic or protestant 
the us state department also has come out against the macbride 
principles 
meanwhile the industrial development board which employs 300 
people and has 11 offices abroad is focusing on finding smaller 
private companies and potential investors in asia which all are 
less vulnerable to pressure and is pushing joint ventures that 
reduce the risk to the outside investor 
the financial incentives we offer are extremely attractive 
bohill said 
the board wont elaborate but for example neotech got its 
factory rentfree for three years 
the cost is high in its first five years the board has put up 
27 million pounds 46 million in aid to create an additional 61 
million pounds 103 million of investment and the 2600 jobs it 
has created through promoting new inward investment have hardly 
dented unemployment 
but by offering incentives and stressing such selling points as 
northern irelands welleducated work force the board helped 
create 867 new jobs at 12 new inward investment projects in its 
most recent financial year a large increase over the previous 12 
months 
were very confident that we will better that this year 
bohill said 
the oldest and probably biggest obstacle to investment remains 
the fear of violence which has killed about 2700 people and has 
escalated in recent months 
no american company or executive has ever been directly touched 
by the conflict but sam lord an american who heads du ponts 
british operations said the perception is like a little beirut 
or south africa its very difficult to get around that 
perception

listen you can come out from under your seat 
now the really gross parts are over 
yes masochists will shed a tear but the filmic fun of flying 
body parts exploding brains and chainsaw haircuts is fading 
todays horror filmmakers abandoning the pointblank plasma of 
recent years are returning to psychological thrillers with a 
wealth of lively style replacing heaps of dead teenagers 
dead ringers which opened to brisk business at the box 
office steers away from the entrails so prevalent in director 
david cronenbergs previous efforts the fly and scanners 
george romero who charmed us with cannibalizing zombies in 1979s 
dawn of the dead just delivered monkey shines a taut 
chiller with hardly any viscera 
while the splatter is gone the suspense is back both dead 
ringers and monkey shines critics agree are profoundly 
frightening 
theres been a lot of good scaring in the last 1520 years 
and you cant do the same old thing anymore said wes craven 
director of the acclaimed original nightmare on elm street 
the audience was bored they had seen it they were ready for 
something different 
hackandslash movies championed in the mid1980s by the 
blockbuster friday the 13th series and later installments of 
the halloween sequels arent producing the packed houses they 
once did in fact this summers grisly shockers the blob and 
phantasm ii both croaked at the box office 
if your film is all a butcherblock collection of death i 
dont think youre working with as large an audience as you could 
be said pen densham director and coproducer of the kiss a 
spooky supernatural thriller opening oct 21 the challenge now 
is to take the audience into your imagination 
few have succeeded at that better than cronenberg while his 
films have always been upsetting the shock value in dead 
ringers is in a twist as fancied as it is real among the most 
disturbing scenes in the movie a tale of psychotic twin doctors 
is the simple unveiling of a halfdozen malformed gynecological 
devices 
the instruments are physical things that im using to 
represent a state of mind cronenberg said its only an 
extrapolation from what we used to feel sitting in a dentists 
chair suddenly the tray of little instruments is wheeled up you 
know that technically they are to help you but experientially 
theyre going to hurt 
the challenge for todays fright masters is to snare the 
mainstream not just those who for lack of anything better to do 
love being scared to death toward that goal directors are 
concentrating on more traditional storytelling with a greater 
emphasis on inventive visuals tighter more logical plots and 
creative music and sound effects 
the directors who are committed to the genre are maturing 
said veteran horror specialist john carpenter director of 
halloween and the thing and the upcoming they live 
horror newcomers too are exploring unusual strategies to 
induce fear in the kiss director densham gives life to a 
swimming pool a wind chime and an escalator my goal is to try 
to fuse vision with emotion densham said in childs play 
coming nov 9 director and cowriter tom holland has created a 
fresh and sometimes funny white knuckler about a toy doll with a 
really bad attitude 
weve all become much more sophisticated in what weve grown 
accustomed to on the screen said richard rubinstein producer of 
stephen kings pet sematary due out early next year if the 
audience cares about the characters then they will care when they 
get into trouble if you introduce a group of teenagers who climb 
off a bus nobody cares when they get popped off 
furthermore the dead teenager movies focused on one fear 
fear of attack when manipulations of that emotion grew too 
frequent the genre lost its original snap when you got down to 
that level with anonymous children dying anonymous deaths what 
youre really doing is pornography carpenter said youre only 
setting the audience up for the meat 
said craven there are different kinds of terror one is just 
terror of having your body harmed something like friday the 
13th with jason coming after you with a machete but there are 
other kinds there is the terror of whether youre sane or not or 
whether your perceptions are accurate or not or whether your 
dreams are real 
those sorts of things to me are much more interesting and 
much more complex and have more of a potential for fright 
cravens new untitled movie scheduled for release next year will 
focus on premonitions hallucinations dreams religious trances 
and possession 
still there will be some gore 
unless you have one scene that really scares people that 
really makes them feel that not only is the killer beyond normal 
rational actions but the filmmaker is too then the audience is 
not really frightened craven said but once you do that you 
dont need to do it over and over again 
entrails enthusiasts however need not panic completely while 
there is room for style in hollywood there will always be a place 
for lowbudget sliceanddice coming soon to theaters near you

it is the tradition of our politics and a 
very poor tradition that the vicepresidency is a shelf henry 
cabot lodge wrote to theodore roosevelt it ought to be and 
there is no reason why it should not be a stepping stone 
pretty slippery stepping stone 
roosevelt did not get to put lodges theory to the test after 
being elected vice president in 1900 he was catapulted into the 
white house by the assassination of president william mckinley 
every vice president who has had the chance to in the last 60 
years however has tried for the presidency while holding the no 
2 position 
so far they have all failed 
alben barkley harry trumans vice president in 1952 could not 
even win his partys nomination he was forced to withdraw in the 
face of labor opposition 
richard nixon as dwight eisenhowers vice president in 1960 
captured the republican presidential nomination easily but lost to 
john f kennedy in a campaign in which he got little help from 
eisenhower he had to wait eight years to win the white house on 
his own 
the candidate he defeated was hubert h humphrey running while 
serving as vice president under lyndon b johnson at the height of 
the unpopular vietnam war 
now george bush is trying it if he wins on nov 8 he will be 
the first vice president to succeed to the presidency by election 
since martin van buren followed andrew jackson into the white house 
in 1836 
political scientists and professional political strategists say 
that although bush is doing better than most vice presidents face 
formidable problems when they try to become no 1 
there is the burden of defending an incumbent administration 
plus the fact that the job is in a way a wimpy job said leo 
ribuffo a specialist in political history at george washington 
university 
a vice president for better or for worse is defined in large 
part by the publics view of the president he serves said frank 
j donatelli president reagans chief political aide 
the fact that we have to hear talk about the reaganbush 
administration as we once had to about eisenhowernixon is 
nonsense said stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution who was an aide in the eisenhower white house its 
not the reaganbush administration its the reagan 
administration 
ryan barrileaux a professor at miami university in oxford 
ohio is a member of a new school of political scientists who 
regard the vice presidency as an important post but even he agreed 
that a lot of vice presidents have the problem that they are 
regarded by people as being generally insignificant 
i think what happens is that they tend to regard him as 
nothing more than a senior presidential aide said barrileaux 
they dont really think of him as an independent politician or as 
someone with a standing in his own right 
scholars say that during much of us history vice presidents 
were not regarded as presidential contenders except for those like 
theodore roosevelt or andrew johnson who became president when an 
incumbent died 
during most of the 19th century with a couple of exceptions 
such as john calhoun vice presidents were nonentities said 
ribuffo 
it was other offices that were regarded as breeding grounds 
for presidents said barrileaux for much of american history 
the secretary of state was regarded as a sort of potential 
president 
for more than a century after van buren no vice president ran 
for president according to presidential alsorans and running 
mates 17881899 compiled by leslie h southwick 
the last one who passed up a shot at it however was charles g 
dawes in 1928 when president calvin coolidge announced that he did 
not choose to run vice president dawes did not choose to run 
either 
in each of the next four presidential elections 1932 through 
1944 the incumbent was running for reelection so there was no 
realistic chance for the vice president to step in in 1948 with 
truman filling out roosevelts term there was no vice president 
then came barkleys abortive try in 1952 in 1956 eisenhower 
was on the ticket in 1964 the vice presidency was again vacant in 
1972 1976 1980 and 1984 incumbents were on the ballot for 
president first nixon then gerald ford jimmy carter and reagan 
which brings up 1988 and bush 
this is different not only to the degree that reagan is 
anxious to do something to help bush on the stump as a campaign 
speaker but also to the degree that he seems almost to have turned 
over major decisions of government to bush where bush cared to 
involve himself said hess 
as examples the brookings scholar cited reagans veto of a 
defense authorization bill and his decision to allow a trade bill 
to become law without his signature instead of vetoing it even 
though it contained a plantclosing amendment that he stoutly 
opposed both actions were favored by bush although opposed by some 
other reagan advisers 
other examples said hess are reagans appointment of secretary 
of the treasury nicholas brady and attorney general dick 
thornburgh both bush allies and the choice for education 
secretary of lauro f cavazos an hispanic from politically crucial 
texas 
also the country is at peace and feeling prosperous he 
said in 1960 we were coming out of a recession in 1968 there 
was a war we are not talking about so many cases that we can 
crunch them through a computer we are talking about a couple of 
cases and each one is a little different but this one is very 
different 
hess and other scholars agreed that reagan has given bush more 
work to do as vice president than most previous presidents have 
although he did not make a key adviser of him as carter did of his 
vice president walter mondale 
bush was not as important as mondale but certainly more 
important than say lyndon johnson was in the kennedy white 
house said barrileaux 
although reagan has often pointed to bushs accomplishments as 
vice president barrileaux said i guess many people didnt think 
of these things as terribly important 
when you mention things like the task force on regulatory 
relief that sounds very enigmatic to many voters i would 
imagine said the miami university scholar 
ribuffo who is writing a book on carter said that carter 
really did include mondale in policy discussions and used him 
extensively as a capitol hill lobbyist 
i dont get the impression that reagan used bush nearly so 
much or included him so much the political historian said 
however he added it doesnt seem to have hurt much so far

editors note preservationists remember penn station the way 
texans remember the alamo indeed the demolition of the old 
station that began 25 years ago this month marked the rise of the 
preservation movement in new york and around the nation

it was a monument to the glory of the roman 
empire and the pennsylvania railroad a great temple of marble and 
granite married to a soaring tent of steel and glass here was a 
building wrote thomas wolfe vast enough to hold the sound of 
time 
built to last for centuries pennsylvania station was only 53 
years old when jackhammers began pounding its walls on oct 28 
1963 25 years ago to make way for a drumshaped sports arena 
and a bland glassandsteel office building 
except for a few protesters who circled disconsolately in a 
drizzle the station passed unmourned 
the demolition crew foreman said it was just another job if 
anybody seriously considered it art they would have put up some 
money to save it his boss added 
this citys got the right name new york observed a man 
behind the counter of the station restaurant nothing ever gets 
old around here 
over the next two years penn station was broken into pieces 
dumped in a new jersey swamp and replaced by the subterranean 
station that bears its name today 
the only reminder of the landmark that filled two blocks on 
seventh avenue between 31st and 33rd streets are two eagles that 
once perched on a ledge over the front door but now squat on the 
ground 
but the old station has monuments wherever people have fought to 
save the buildings they love because the fall of penn station 
marked the rise of the preservation movement in new york and around 
the nation 
most preservation groups form around a preservation battle 
and often they lose the first one says sally oldham of the 
national trust for historic preservation the whole story of the 
movement is the story of lost buildings 
pennsylvania station was the greatest loss of all 
through it one entered the city like a god architectural 
historian vincent scully has written one scuttles in now like a 
rat

at the turn of the century the pennsylvania railroad was the 
largest company in the greatest industry the world had ever known 
the railroads president alexander cassatt wanted a building that 
would make a trip into the city an occasion 
inspired by the baths of carcalla in rome architect charles 
follen mckim designed a station twice as large as the hamburg 
railroad station then the worlds largest and nearly three times 
larger than any american station 
mckims vision was set on the edge of hells kitchen a rough 
west side neighborhood of factories stockyards slaughterhouses 
and tenements five hundred buildings were razed to make way for 
the station and 1500 people displaced 
when work began in 1906 people compared the excavation to the 
panama canal the great hole as it was known reached 58 feet 
into the ground 
when it was finished in 1910 observers were equally impressed 
on seventh avenue a twoblocklong row of doric columns each 35 
feet high and 4 feet thick rose to meet a low roof 
fourteen granite eagles each 5 feet tall and 5700 pounds 
roosted on a ledge under the roof each of the four main entrances 
was topped by a clock with a dial 7 feet in diameter flanked by 
the statues of women symbolizing night and day 
but the new stations real attractions were inside the general 
waiting room the size of the nave of st peters featured 
sixstory high corinthian columns and a vaulted ceiling 150 feet 
high through it passengers moved to the train shed whose soaring 
glassandsteel roof achieved the same affect as the waiting room 
only on modern terms 
william faulkner heard in the rafters the voices of all the 
travelers who have ever passed through that ranged from 
president franklin d roosevelt heading for his home in hyde park 
to the depression homeless going nowhere 
in those days it did not matter that the station was 
architecturally unrelated to anything around it or that its huge 
spaces exhilarating on first sight became tiresome when crossed 
repeatedly so what if there were no seats in the main waiting 
room or an information booth 
but the end of world war ii was the beginning of hard times for 
railroads by 1951 the pennsylvania railroad was running a 72 
million annual deficit four years later the railroad quietly 
agreed to sell the stations surface space to developers and build 
a new smaller station below street level 
meanwhile the pennsys deteriorating finances were reflected in 
its station the train sheds glass roof became grimy with soot 
and broken windows were replaced with metal the huge topographic 
wall maps which depicted the railroads territory were almost 
obliterated the pink granite had turned a dull city gray 
the general waiting room was marred by a modern structure that 
housed ticket booths as well as incongruous advertising signs and 
displays that critic lewis mumford said turned the room into a 
vast jukebox 
finally in 1961 the railroad broke the news penn station 
would come down to make way for the third madison square garden 
critic ada louise huxtable noted that americans could never 
again afford to build a nineacre structure of superbly detailed 
solid travertine any more than we could build one of solid 
gold and a few young architects organized in protest and 
picketed the station

the outcome was never in doubt the public had no interest in 
saving the dirty neglected old building and the city had no 
authority 
but that began to change almost as soon as the stations 
destruction began the next day the new york times called it the 
shame of new york and concluded we want and deserve tincan 
architecture in a tinhorn culture and we probably will be judged 
not by the monuments we build but by those we have destroyed 
in death the station became more precious than in life as it 
slowly was demolished over the next two years people had time to 
contemplate the twisted steel and broken marble to which the 
station had been reduced the railroad was deluged with requests 
for the stations remains ranging from the eagles to squares from 
the floor 
suddenly the preservation issue was on the front page across 
the country and it created the feeling of we are not alone among 
local preservation groups says elliott willensky an architect 
who protested the stations destruction 
penn stations destruction touched a nerve because it was the 
most visible sign of what had been going on across the nation for 
the previous 15 years 
between 1930 and 1946 depression and war curtailed construction 
of new buildings and thus the destruction of old ones but in the 
boom that followed the end of world war ii virtually no historic 
building was safe 
in south philadelphia hundreds of late 18th and early 
19thcentury buildings were destroyed to make way for an interstate 
highway in bridgeport conn an 1848 gothic revival mansion that 
had been willed to the city was torn down to make way for a parking 
lot boston lost its opera house in 1957 and a group of buildings 
designed by bullfinch on india warf five years later 
but penn stations loss seemed to mark a turning point its 
death was necessary to make us realize what could be lost 
journalist lorraine diehl later mused 
largely in response new york city created the landmarks 
preservation commission although a few cities notably charleston 
sc and new orleans already had such agencies new yorks could 
designate entire neighborhoods as historic districts 
although the commission cannot grant a building absolute 
protection there are circumstances under which an owner can tear 
a landmark down the new law made their destruction far more 
difficult 
to date the commission has landmarked 824 individual 
structures 75 interiors and 9 parks plus 14415 buildings in 50 
historic districts including the upper east side greenwich village 
and brooklyn heights flatbush alone has three separate districts 
without commission protection many architectural jewels 
notably the radio city music hall almost certainly would have 
been destroyed or significantly altered 
federal highway and urban renewal funds had been used to destroy 
thousands of historic buildings but in 1966 the national register 
of historic places was created to hamper such destruction 
before the national register the federal government recognized 
only about 900 landmarks and afforded them no protection today 
the register has more than 50000 entries including whole 
neighborhoods like washingtons georgetown 
at the local level where buildings are saved or lost more than 
1000 communities have preservation zoning ordinances compared to 
fewer than 40 in 1963 
in the years since penn stations demise many great buildings 
have been saved the wainwright building in st louis an early 
skyscraper designed by louis sullivan grand central terminal in 
new york whose protection by the landmarks commission was upheld 
by the supreme court the ornate old executive office building 
next door to the white house which was saved when congress refused 
to appropriate funds for its demolition 
today preservationists remember penn station the way texans 
remember the alamo when some of them wanted to protest a proposed 
change in the city landmarks law earlier this year they returned 
to the scene of the crime 
the lesson we learned here is that if we fail to be vigilant 
we will lose the things that matter one speaker said 
the lesson is about all thats left of the old station for a 
time train passengers riding to and from new york through the new 
jersey meadowlands could see the remains including the sculpted 
female figures of day and night 
a few pieces were claimed by the brooklyn museum and ringwood 
manor state park in new jersey some of the eagles were shipped to 
the pennsys 30th street station in philadelphia as well as to 
stations along the long island rail road 
the stations destruction could not save the pennsylvania 
railroad which merged with the new york central in 1968 and filed 
for bankruptcy two years later leaving railroading to the federal 
government 
the new penn station which needed a massive renovation 
less than 25 years after its completion has been dismissed by new 
york times critic paul goldberger as a depressing maze of 
underground corridors pretending to be a train terminal and one 
of the more notable architectural disasters of the 20th century 
irving felt chairman of the madison square garden center corp 
had higher hopes in 1963 when he predicter wane when the 
socalled new wind starts to blow or those who bear 
responsibility for having brought the economy and other social 
sectors into critical situations and yet call today for new

politics and taverns used to go together like

manuel maloof runs his campaign not from 
some sterile tv studio but from a smoky old tavern that two 
generations of dixie politicians have come to refer to reverently 
as the shrine 
maloff is chief executive officer of booming dekalb county 
population 534000 and growing up for reelection to a second term 
he is as unlikely a candidate you could find running a major 
urban government rumpled gruff outspoken emotional the proud 
antithesis of the blowdried politician of the 80s 
such is his popularity that ordinarily this might not be such a 
tough race for him but this year his health could become an issue 
it has not been the easiest of years for manuel j maloof 
first he went in the hospital for a bad foot and wound up 
receiving last rites twice as he nearly died from pneumonia 
then he had some trouble breathing and wound up with 
quadruplebypass heart surgery 
but fighting the odds is nothing new to maloof son of a 
lebanese immigrant and perhaps atlantas most famous tavern owner 
manuels tavern on the nowhip fringe where atlantas 
commercial east side gives way to dekalb county and the dignified 
druid hills neighborhood is a quintessential tavern not a joint 
or a nightclub but a real tavern where a body can find a properly 
cold beer a burger at reasonable prices and a place to talk 
regulars call it the shrine the wall street journal once 
called it a a smoky dive which the staff promptly put on 
tshirts 
manuels is smoky the wagonwheel light fixtures looking like 
they came from a longclosed family steakhouse dont match there 
are pictures of john and bobby kennedy over the bar and beer signs 
on the walls and a painting of a nude woman over the booths a 
patron once handed it over as payment for his bar tab 
manuels has big round tables so friends can gather and talk 
and its bright enough for patrons to see who theyre talking to 
thats important to maloof and its his tavern and his years of 
holding court there that propelled him into politics where he 
landed as chief executive officer of booming dekalb county 
population 534000 and growing 
maloof now 64 grew passionately interested in government in 
his youth listening to the politicians and the government workers 
in the tip top billiard parlor the atlanta tavern and gme room run 
by his father gibran maloof a 1907 immigrant from beirut 
manuels own tavern which he opened in 1956 soon became a meeting 
place for politicians journalists and academics who talked into 
the night about the issues of the day 
my father was one of the best americans that ever lived 
maloof says he just believed that we owed this country while he 
never encouraged me to go into government he sort of instilled 
in me that we owe it and we ought to pay it back 
maloof at first thought politics wouldnt be open to him because 
of his foreign extraction the fact that he was a catholic not 
too popular in the county in those days and because he was in 
the bar business 
by 1972 maloof had become known as the behindthescenes 
godfather of democratic politics in dekalb county the tavern was 
an unofficial party headquarters and maloof supported the party 
financially when it was strapped for cash that year brought a race 
for a dekalb county commission seat and nobody would run as a 
democrat he recalls 
i was trying to get some people to run and everybody copped 
out so it came down to the clock running out and i said what 
the hell ill just do it just to be a token candidate we cannot 
allow it to go unchallenged 
he lost but he was pleasantly surprised to land 42 percent of 
the vote and two years later he tried again winning this time an 
atlarge post he served until 1978 then stepped aside maloof 
said he couldnt take it anymore 
but in 1980 he jumped back into politics beating the incumbent 
county commission chairman in 84 he won the newlycreated post 
of chief executive officer 
maloof is hardly a polished politician he sporadically 
threatens to quit he says what he thinks i believe they take my 
word if i tell them something they know im not going to lie to 
them he says 
and he plunges into the nutsandbolts of government running 
the county the way he runs his business never spend money unless 
you have to and never pay the asking price

this year maloof is seeking his second term as ceo the last 
hes allowed by law and that he says will be it ill be 68 
years old if i even live that long ill be thankful 
maloof has long fought diabetes a disease underlying his other 
health problems one leg is larger than the other leaving him with 
a laborious gait he was soaking a painful foot earlier this year 
when he was scalded and complications set in infection 
pneumonia blood clots in both lungs 
they wrote my obit maloof says with a laugh theyve 
still got it out there in the office they wrote me off 
he recalls lying in his hospital bed terribly ill seeing 
this cliff in my mind that i was going to fall off of and die 
it was all covered with all this slimy green vegetation vines and 
stuff and i could look down in there and see this hole i was 
going to fall off of there and all of a sudden they just pushed 
me back 
it was maloof believes firmly the prayers of his many friends 
which saved his life ill believe that til my dying day he 
says 
maloof hears that hes mellowed 
no thats not so he growls ive always said theres the 
blessed and the damned the blessed are those who dont give a 
damn and the damned are those who do somehow or another i was 
always the damned because if i think somethings not right 
im not going to just let it slide 
maloof acknowledges that coming close to death gave me a lot 
to think about you get in these jobs and you get to wondering 
everything i do must make somebody mad but there was a genuine 
outpouring of affection in those prayers that was the nicest 
surprise 
maloof was a delegate to this summers democratic national 
convention in atlanta for another son of immigrants michael 
dukakis maloof is an unabashed oldstyle democrat in a time when 
liberal is a political profanity and ronald reagan calls 
dukakis an invalid maloof worries what has happened to his 
country and its politics 
they throw up these walls and youre a wayout leftwinger 
because you care about people he says all of a sudden it 
isnt right to say what you think and we are losing that ability 
i think 
what happened to us maybe its because ive gotten old 
these days manuels tavern only sees manuel once or twice a 
week he doesnt have the time his brother robert maloof and his 
children run the original tavern and two branches in the suburbs 
but there was a time when maloof ran his bar morning til night 
and his friends gathered round politicians and journalists would 
argue politics faculty members from nearby emory university would 
hold afterclass seminars a religion professor named tom alitzer 
was explaining his god is dead theory at manuels long before 
the rest of the world heard about it 
maloff still prides himself on building a tavern where cussing 
too loudly will get you tossed where a woman can sip a beer 
without getting hit on and where talk and friendship are the best 
entertainment 
maloof has firm ideas about he wants people to remember him 
years from now when hell be running neither their county nor 
their bar 
i hope they just say he knew what he was doing he cared he 
really cared

editors note american consumption of poultry has increased 
dramatically in the past couple of decades but there are few 
stores left where you can pick out your chicken while its still 
clucking one of them is johns live poultry and egg market in 
an ethnic neighborhood in chicago 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the shop sounds like a barnyard roosters crow 
chickens cluck and squawk pigeons coo and rabbits thump and jostle 
in their cages 
step inside back to a time when there were no giant supermarket 
chains or frozenfood sections and momandpop grocery stores kept 
crates of live chickens out back 
at the small store tucked away in a polish and italian 
neighborhood customers who order a fryer broiler or roaster take 
home chicken so fresh it was squawking 15 minutes earlier 
the butcher who wields his knife with a surgeons pride also 
sells fresh rabbit quail pigeon duck geese and the bantam 
roosters favored in some italian kitchens for stews and sauces 
ive been here for 27 years and the stores been here since 
the second world war says the proprietor al gordon 51 
although esh turkeys 
time has sharpened his skills though he says he still works up 
to 50 hours a week and at least 15 hours a day around thanksgiving 
and christmas 
on average gordon sells 400 to 500 chickens 40 to 50 rabbits 
and 15 to 20 ducks a week 
ninety percent of the poultry is raised by amish farmers in 
indiana gordon says 
they dont use any chemicals theres no preservatives in 
them he says all of your storebought poultry are dipped in a 
preservative to give them a longer shelflife

community foundations for a long time the quiet 
arms of philanthropy are coming of age and providing funds for 
more serious projects than ever before the hartford foundation is 
a prime example of the change in size and activity 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the ford foundation decided to lend 
a helping hand to aids patients and their families it found that 
even with its billions of dollars it couldnt handle the project 
alone 
it sought the help of much smaller community foundations 
nonprofit organizations that are emerging as key players in 
philanthropic work in this country 
in the last five years community foundations have come of age 
and are being recognized for their potential and what theyre 
doing said r malcolm salter director of the hartford 
foundation for public giving 
since the first community foundation was founded by bankers in 
cleveland in 1914 many of the organizations have been content to 
fund such activities as planting flowers or supporting the local 
symphony 
but increasingly community foundations are being called on to 
tackle more serious issues such as aids a trend their leaders 
attribute in part to the reagan administrations eight years 
promoting volunteerism and reducing federal spending on social 
services 
the result is that community foundations now make up the 
smallest but fastest growing faction of the council on 
foundations a washington dcbased group that represents most of 
the nations foundations 
there are now about 325 community foundations and another 20 
have been proposed and are in various stages of organization 
according to council officials 
the combined assets of those groups are estimated at about 4 
billion and they made grants totaling about 300 million last year 
ford meanwhile has assets of about 55 billion and made 
grants totaling 204 million in 1987 said joanne b scanlan who 
directs the councils effort to bolster community foundations 
for a long time community foundations have been kind of a 
quiet type of philanthropy scanlan said over time partly 
because assets have built up and partly because community 
foundations have started working together and promoting themselves 
a lot more private foundations have started working with them 
the hartford foundation is recognized as a leader among 
community foundations in both its size and activity its assets of 
roughly 125 million make it the sixth largest in the nation while 
it doles out about 6 million annually to various hartfordarea 
projects 
the wealthiest of the community foundations in the country is in 
new york followed by foundations in cleveland chicago boston 
san francisco and hartford 
new yorks community foundation has assets of about 500 
million while clevelands has about 450 million in assets 
scanlan said 
every foundation is organized under federal tax guidelines as a 
nonprofit organization 
unlike the united way which must solicit funds each year to 
give money to specific groups community foundations have 
endowments from which they draw earnings to fund their grant 
programs 
the foundations rely on donations from individuals and 
corporations to continue expanding their endowments 
a donor can have a longterm impact since it is the interest on 
a gift and not the donation itself that is spent from year to year 
said tom smith the council on foundations public affairs director 
its more than a onetime gift because what a community 
foundation does is it pools those funds and your money can go 
farther smith said 
connecticut has 19 community foundations most of them very 
small in comparison to hartfords which is the states largest 
waterbury established the states first community foundation in 
1923 followed by hartford in 1925 
the hartford foundation is unlike most other community 
foundations in the value of its assets and how it uses its wealth 
ninetyone percent of its funds are unrestricted meaning it can 
use those assets to make grants to any project salter said most 
other foundations are limited to spending their money on very 
specific projects he said 
the foundation is particularly blessed to have most of its 
funds unrestricted which gives the distribution committees now 
and in the future the discretion of where the money can best go 
salter said 
for instance the foundation has a 35 million project to 
combat poverty in hartford it also provides millions of dollars 
more in grants to local hospitals civic organizations as well as 
the symphony arts groups and colleges 
the foundation gives up to 75000 to a firsttime recipient 
with the money paid in one year or spread over three years a 
repeat client can receive up to 300000 paid in one year or 
spread over three 
the hartford foundations recent experience exemplifies what is 
happening to community foundations around the country particularly 
in terms of demand 
applications to the foundation were up 28 percent this year 
compared to last and the amount of money requested was up 70 
percent in the past eight years the foundation has given out 34 
million compared to just 25 million in its first four decades 
in response the foundation changed its rules it will no longer 
accept requests for funds on a firstcomefirstserved basis its 
distribution committee will now meet seven times a year to dispense 
funds 
i think well be much more visible in the future than in the 
past because were becoming more actively involved in initiating 
and bringing people together salter said

editors note they may be the luckiest kids in alaska or all 
of the united states for that matter they have a mountain of 
garnet they can mine as they wish but its often the parents stuck 
with the dirty work the children are mostly the peddlers and like 
in the modeling profession theirs is a trade where youth is 
allimportant

a mayors gift of a mountainside of 
garnets to the children of this remote island town has turned two 
generations of its youngsters into industrious gem dealers 
paper routes and lawn mowing provide small change compared to 
the 1000 or so a wrangell child can earn each summer by hawking 
garnets to cruise ship passengers and other tourists 
crowds of children meet almost every ship at the wrangell 
waterfront carrying their gems in everything from muffin tins to 
tupperware some stand shyly and depend on tourists curiosity to 
draw customers but most warble wanna buy a garnet 
tourists pay a quarter for a peasized purple gem 20 or more 
for a golf ballsize garnet embedded in a chunk of the silvery 
schist from which it was chiseled 
the garnets come from a mountainside at the mouth of the stikine 
river on the mainland about nine miles from wrangell 
the property was deeded to the boy scouts of america in 1962 by 
the late fred hanford a former mayor of wrangell a town of about 
2100 in southeastern alaska under the terms of the gift only boy 
scouts and the children of wrangell have rights to mine and sell 
the garnets 
in reality garnet collecting is a backkinking kneescraping 
thumbsmashing chore that falls to the gem sellers parents 
i dont know whats more work the kids homework or selling 
garnets says kay jabusch one of the selfdescribed garnet 
moms who accompany their children to the docks 
about every six weeks mrs jabusch and her husband jeff pilot 
their river skiff through the shifting channels of the stikine to 
reach the garnet ledge and replenish their sons supplies they lug 
pails chisels and hammers up the quartermile trail that climbs to 
the garnet ledge 
a few stones can be screened from loose soil and rock next to a 
nearby stream but most must be chiseled out of huge faces of rock 
power tools and blasting are forbidden adults who want to go to 
the ledge are asked to buy a 10 permit at the wrangell museum and 
turn over a portion of their take to the boy scouts the scouts 
also ask people to sign a liabilityrelease form 
old wrangell newspapers say the ledge was mined from 1907 to 
1923 by the alaska garnet mining and manufacturing co of 
minneapolis minn a company run by two sisters 
a geological study done in the 1940s says wrangell garnets are 
superb for industrial uses such as sandpaper but that few become 
jewels the garnets have quartz inclusions that cause them to 
fracture when cut most buyers want them as curiosity pieces 
though some say they will try to set the stones 
im going to get mine polished for my granddaughter for her 
21st birthday says rhoda west of rancho cucamonga calif 
a north carolina couple getting off the same ship bought garnets 
for their son a geologist and a new mexico woman bought a 
garnetstudded rock for her mothers knickknack shelf 
selling can be hard work children get up before dawn to meet 
early ferries and often stand in drenching rain to make their sales 
watching her sons work the state ferry dock rynda hayes 
explains why its worthwhile for raymond 7 and ryan 9 
they want new bikes theyve always had secondhand 
puttogether bikes says hayes who recalls selling garnets when 
she was their age 
the jabusch boys bought their own tickets to hawaii for this 
years family vacation garnet moms also say their children dont 
ask for allowances and get better grades in math class after a 
summer of making change 
many young garnet sellers have opened their own savings 
accounts though in their minds the saving for college angle 
is mostly a sales gimmick 
most people say theyre doing it for college then they go buy 
a bike says 11yearold mike jabusch confiding his sales 
secrets adds friend toby dow if its for college more people 
buy 
toby also 11 likes to tell people they can buy one garnet and 
get another free tenyearold bob roppel has another sales tip 
try to look sad 
the boys talk business over cups of hot cocoa at a dockside 
restaurant one proposes lowering prices to boost everyones sales 
launching an earnest debate over whether the discount should be 50 
cents or a quarter 
earnings are secret the only boy who will say what he makes is 
the undisputed sales champ 7yearold jake jabusch 
in less than an hour on the dock jake collected 3320 he 
quickly added it up and figured his threeday take 98 
with a mop of blond hair and an urchin grin jake doesnt have 
to do much to make a sale tourists many of them grandparents 
flock to tousle his hair hug him and buy his garnets 
but mrs jabusch says jakes glory days are numbered like other 
wrangell youth hell find sales dwindling as he gets older they 
get taller and the tourists like the younger kids she says 
most children abandon their garnet trays she says the day they 
look around and realize theyre the oldest kids on the dock

the masters are gone but today the rodgers and 
hammerstein office is more than just a clearing house for the great 
shows of broadways most successful musical partnership 
from what was once richard rodgers madison avenue office 
theatrical properties are licensed protected polished and even 
rediscovered for an empire built upon such smash hits as 
oklahoma carousel south pacific the king and i 
and the sound of music 
from high school drama society to a big producer in londons 
west end if you want to do a rodgers and hammerstein show you 
start there at the office when the beef amp boards dinner theater in 
indianapolis for example decided to do the sound of music in 
september its first task was to contact the ramph office 
what the dinner theater eventually received according to its 
artistic directorproducer douglas stark was a stack of sound of 
music scripts and orchestrations which the theater adapted for 
its own fivepiece orchestra royalties were based on a percentage 
of boxoffice gross for the 400seat theater which has a top price 
of 2795 for dinner and a show on saturday night 
thats a standard package of material says theodore s 
chapin the ebullient 37yearold executive director of the rodgers 
and hammerstein office and son of schuyler chapin once general 
manager of the metropolitan opera 
the history of the ramph office dates to 1943 somewhere between 
the time oklahoma went into rehearsal and when it opened on 
broadway when rodgers and oscar hammerstein ii realized what 
valuable commodities they had created 
the two men had worked for years with other collaborators 
rodgers with lorenz hart and hammerstein with jerome kern sigmund 
romberg and rudolf friml among others 
their goal was to keep as much inhouse as they could 
chapin says they got to the point where they were writing 
producing managing and publishing their own music through the 
williamson music co both had fathers named william 
among the successful nonrodgers and hammerstein shows they 
produced were irving berlins annie get your gun i remember 
mama john loves mary and the happy time 
what we know today as the stock and amateur market never did 
musicals chapin says high schools did straight plays like 
charleys aunt it wasnt until the rise of summer tent theater 
in the 1950s that the whole secondary market for these musicals 
opened up 
oklahoma has always been the most popular rodgers and 
hammerstein musical with strong competition from south pacific 
and the sound of music 
one of the amazing things about the rodgers and hammerstein 
canon is that there are five big shows chapin says and five 
big shows are enough to go in cycles so that when one of them is 
dormant another comes back strong 
the rented scripts used for most of the big shows are the london 
scripts chapin says one of the things his staff is trying to do 
is go through them and change the dialogue to more american 
english taking out the anglicized words oklahoma has already 
been done and south pacific is being worked on now 
chapin also got the original scores from the library of congress 
and had the orchestrations recopied so copies sent to theaters 
could be more authentic 
you would think that there would be absolutely letterperfect 
scripts and orchestrations chapin says but there werent 
these two men were savers but in the backroom and the trunk they 
would change things to make them work on stage 
the companys rental library also handles shows by other 
authors it rents most of the rodgers and hart musicals like the 
boys from syracuse babes in arms and pal joey it also 
has kurt weills the threepenny opera and the recent musical 
hit big river in its catalog 
when he has a chance chapin keeps an eye on different 
productions rodgers and hammerstein license in one recent week he 
was in dallas to catch a sound of music with debby boone and 
then in chicago to take in pal joey starring kevin anderson and 
carlin glynn 
one of the strangest productions he has seen was a 
showwithinashow version at new york university the director set 
the musical in a rehabilitation ward where the recovering veterans 
put on south pacific 
it was a little peculiar he says what we did in that 
instance was let them run the contract out they wanted to extend 
the run but we said no to that 
chapin has not permitted anyone to videotape their productions 
because it violates the various shows movie contracts 
i am very aware of the fact that the authors are not alive 
chapin says we are basically in a caretaking position their 
families have some very strong ideas on how to keep their fathers 
and their husbands work alive and what changes will or will not be 
allowed 
chapin has his own ideas for rodgers and hammerstein revivals 
one is a television production of pipe dream an unsuccessful 
musical written for wagnerian opera singer helen traubel chapins 
version would star the muppets 
the musical is based on john steinbecks sweet thursday 
which has a great collection of people who are just hanging around 
a skid row chapin says he envisions miss piggy playing the 
helen traubel role 
chapin is also gearing up for the 50th anniverary of 
oklahoma in 1993 which should prompt an avalanche of 
productions and interest in songwriting team 
america has not forgotten who rodgers and hammerstein are 
chapin says hammerstein died in 1960 and rodgers in 1979 but 
their music is still around the sound of music is played on 
television every year it has been on the video sales charts for 
more than 150 weeks the last time i looked 
and they still get live productions 
these shows are classics says stark whose production of 
the sound of music is running in indianapolis through nov 6 
people love them and keep coming back six years ago we did the 
sound of music and its selling better now that it did the last 
time

the government does not publish figures on gold production but 
the soviet union is recognized as a world leader shilo who still 
works in the prestigious academy of sciences in moscow estimates 
that perhaps 20 percent of the nations gold comes from the far 
east 
one exploration chief in the area vladimir zinchenko said the 
government buys gold from the mines for 18 rubles a gram a third 
of an ounce on paper that works out to 29 at the official 
exchange rate of the ruble and adds up to more than twice the world 
market price of about 400 an ounce but such figures have little 
meaning because the ruble is not a convertible currency on world 
markets and its black market value is only a fraction of the 
official rate 
but gold itself can buy the goods now unavailable to soviets in 
poorly supplied stateowned stores 
zinchenko said the black market price for gold is about 78 
rubles 125 a gram more than four times the official price 
fifty years ago magadan was little more than a passthrough 
point for the gold fields and labor camps of the kolyma river basin 
a couple of stone houses and rows of wooden barracks resting on 
the hills overlooking the harbor were all that greeted prisoners 
who had endured weeks on crowded filthy eastbound trains to 
vladivostok from there they were loaded on ferries for the 
1350mile trip north to magadan and then sent inland from there 
shilo passed through magadan on his way north in 1938 as did 
asir sandler who was a prisoner 
sandler who said he was accused of spying was on his way as a 
forced laborer in the gold mines where he recently recalled 
prisoners could expect to be overworked underfed and dead within a 
year 
sandler survived however and lives today in magadan as a 
writer 
mayor gennady dorofeyev of magadan said the last of the old 
prison barracks were torn down in 1987 
magadan residents dorofeyev added had discussed turning some 
of them into monuments to the horror of stalins repression but 
decided its better that we build homes and kindergartens instead 
of such gloomy places 
officials insist that economic development and the heavy 
migration to the far east makes it look to the future instead of 
the past 
klyuchnikov the academy of sciences researcher said 
development of the far east must emphasize joint projects by small 
and midsized enterprises with japan china and other pacific 
countries 
officials in magadan said they are eager to work out agreements 
with pacific neighbors including the united states one joint 
fishprocessing agreement already has been set 
vyacheslav kobets government leader of magadan province who 
headed a delegation that visited alaska in september said the 
soviets think there are much greater opportunities for joint 
sovietamerican cooperation in fishing oil exploration and tourism 
we have taken only the first step in our common 
relationship he said

kirakasyants and five other crew members work 
flying eight to nine hours a day in their propellordriven 
35yearold ilyushin 14 they chart passages through dense ice 
packs for the soviet arctic fleet to tiny outposts like pevek on 
the east siberian sea check water temperatures and observe the 
movement of whales and walruses 
and although kiraksyants is proud of his work and is accustomed 
to many of the difficulties of life in the far east he sometimes 
questions whether its worth the struggle 
like most others who live in the isolated territory 
kirakasyants was born elsewhere his fathers decision a generation 
ago to take a mechanics job in pevek led the family from 
leningrad the soviet unions secondlargest city to a settlement 
only a handful of soviets will ever see 
thousands of soviets have made a similar decision heading north 
and east for adventure or pay that averages three to four times 
more than workers in the european part of the country 
i went with my father to the airport many times and he showed 
me the planes kirakasyants said taking a break during a recent 
flight to lavrentiya on the bering strait it determined my 
future i always dreamed of being a pilot 
like many residents here in the arctic circle kirakasyants 
brushes off the effects of temperatures that reach 67 degrees below 
zero the cold is bearable he said because the air is dry 
but life in pevek is hardly stimulating he said touring groups 
from the big cities to the west provide what little cultural 
activities are available 
food is flown in or brought by ships when ice conditions permit 
in september harvest time in the southern soviet union stores 
here had grapes watermelons plums and other fresh foods but at 
other times of the year such perishables are unavailable and the 
supply of staples other than canned goods is uncertain 
kirakasyants hopes to move someday but not necessarily back to 
a european city perhaps he said hed go to magadan the 
provincial capital of 160000 people to the southeast on the sea of 
ohkotsk and fly passenger jets for aeroflot the soviet airline 
life is getting better for us here he said but not as 
fast as i would like 
yuri moskvin 37 and boris savekin 38 the men of the earth 
live south of pevek in palatka a goldmining area just inland from 
magadan where kirakasyants would like to go 
they too are thinking of where they might want to go once they 
have reaped their rewards from the soviet far east and retire 
moskvin a goldmine shift leader already knows hes going 
someplace warmer and less remote savekin a mechanic in the same 
mine isnt so sure 
savekin came to the mine near palatka 14 years ago and now earns 
a salary of 800 rubles 1200 a month four times more than the 
nationwide average for an industrial worker like others with jobs 
underground he works a sixhour shift gets 54 days of vacation a 
year and will be eligible to retire at age 50 
palatka where savekin and moskvin live is a town of 
brokendown wooden buildings and dreary housing blocks 
moskvin a 12year veteran of the mine told visiting reporters 
that his mother was one of the first komsomol or young communist 
league workers sent to open up the far east so his ties to the 
area are long 
but he said he already has decided to retire somewhere in the 
european part of the country 
savekin who hasnt made any definite plans for his future said 
he is satisfied here with the tworoom apartment he shares with his 
wife and two children ages 10 and 16

a few months ago linda clark 
struggled in brooklyn to write the opening pages of her first 
novel familiar voices 
two or three nights a week after commuting home from a job 
writing technical manuals in manhattan she would scribble ideas in 
a spiral notebook or capture a passage or two on her ibm selectric 
typewriter 
shed tell friends she had a class but still the phone would 
ring periodically or shed get hungry or a growing laundry pile 
would cast a dim shadow over her prose 
her novels gestation period lengthening with each passing day 
clark mailed off an application to use an isolated artists studio 
at new hampshires macdowell colony she was one of more than 220 
writers painters composers sculptors and photographers granted 
temporary use of 31 secluded wilderness studios this year 
the daytoday routine at the 450acre colony is not real life 
nor does it try to be founded in 1907 by the widow of composer 
edward macdowell its a place says president david heleniak 
where life is simple where artists work well 
that simplicity includes a private oneroom cabin in the woods 
a basket lunch catered to fussy diets and delivered daily and the 
guarantee of distractionfree seclusion from breakfast to dinner 
total price whatever the artist can pay toward the 90aday 
cost 
apparently the formula works in 81 years 43 pulitzer prize and 
41 prix de rome winners have found tinder for their creative fires 
in the woods of macdowell the nations oldest and some say most 
prestigious artists colony 
its not for everybody some artists cant stand the isolation 
and in fact need diversions to work but for the right person at 
the right time a stay at macdowell can be manna from heaven 
pulitzer prizewinning dramatist thornton wilder said the colony 
gave him kindness when he needed it and a place to hear myself 
think composer aaron copeland said it carried out its goals 
magnificently and has provided a unique contribution to 
american cultural life composerconductor leonard bernstein said 
macdowell inspired works of vastness dealing with subjects of 
astronomical if not mystical and astrological dimensions 
you have a perfect day and then you realize youre going to 
have another the pulitzer prizewinning historian barbara 
tuchman said 
for the 28yearold clark privacy and support of her fellow 
artists provided the atmosphere for her to produce almost a third 
of her book in the first four weeks 
i even took a day off and finished a story she said ive 
never been able to write a story this fast 
the scene of this epic productivity was watson studio a 1915 
gray stucco bungalow graced with six grand white pillars mimicking 
a southern plantation house one of the colonys only livein 
studios this miniature tara lies nuzzled in the woods at the end 
of a dirt road marked with the threatening sign no vehicles or 
viewers beyond this point 
other artists sleep in homey dormitory rooms and trek each 
morning down roads marked with similar warnings to their 
studios 
clarks typewriter sits on a chunky victorian table in the 
20by30 foot room which is decorated in a style described by a 
former resident as impoverished nobility other furnishings 
include a grand piano an antique bed a gilt chandelier and a 
threadbare couch 
enhancing this obvious long history are 10 wooden plaques 
tombstones hanging on the walls beside watson studios red 
brick fireplace they contain the many signatures of the studios 
famous and notsofamous previous occupants dating back to the 
1920s author james baldwin signed his name in the 60s 
bernsteins appears several times in the 60s and 70s 
for some the idyllic conditions the isolation or the legacy of 
success create stifling fears 
i dont think i would be constitutionally able to head off 
into the woods after breakfast and hear nothing until dinner except 
the thump of the lunch basket on the front porch author william 
styron said in august before receiving the 1988 macdowell medal for 
his lifes work in fact i think my sanity might be at risk 
some colonists have been known to turn over the tombstones in 
their studios to escape the scrutiny of hundreds of absent artists 
the first time i was here when i was younger i freaked out 
the first three weeks said debra weisberg 35 a sculptor from 
somerville mass it was just paralyzing its perfection and 
you feel like if you dont do the best work you ever did then 
youre not using this well 
ten years after her initial visit weisberg says shes matured 
as an artist and is comfortable working at mixter a slateroofed 
stone cottage whose latticed windows look out on a dark pine 
forest this time shes concentrating on translating the energy of 
her sculptures into two dimensions her earthtone drawings 
inspired by decaying forms in nature cover several rolling display 
panels in the 30s studio 
weisberg said shes learned to trust her instincts about when to 
work and when to take a walk or write a letter or just think 
youre not a factory youre not a machine you have to take care 
of yourself physically and mentally and spiritually to keep making 
artwork 
making the decision to set aside five or six weeks for work also 
seems to help artists get into the right mental state to write 
paint compose or edit 
author martha weinman lear credits the formalization of 
commitment 
a writer does not come here to have writers block she 
wrote not to deny or be disrespectful of the muse is simply 
isnt done 
in this new england climate not parsimonious but spare 
commendably frugal a writers block which in new york is 
something to dine out on and bemoan in a boastful way like new 
york itself would be a frivolous shame and a waste 
in 1928 virginia woolf wrote the essay a room of ones own 
about the conditions artists specifically women artists need to 
create works of genius her conclusion was that in addition to 
education and a sense of tradition and history an artist needs a 
private room in which to work and an independent income 
imaginative work is not dropped like a pebble upon the 
ground she said fiction is like a spiders web attached ever 
so lightly perhaps but still attached to life at all four corners 
 
but when the web is pulled askew hooked up at the edge torn 
in the middle one remembers that these webs are not spun in midair 
by incorporeal creatures but are the work of human beings and are 
attached to grossly material things like health and money and the 
houses we live in 
macdowell temporarily provides a room and the illusion of 
independent wealth and when an artists stay ends perhaps he or 
she has the momentum to move beyond lifes mundane chores

sex says lita ford goes with rock n 
roll like tires on a cab 
the compact blonde offers no apologies for the skimpy outfits 
and pouty looks she displays on the cover of her third album 
lita which produced the hit single kiss me deadly 
its advertisement ford said during a recent dressing room 
interview at the glens falls civic center besides you make 
money off selling merchandise i mean how do you sell a pack of 
cigarettes without advertising 
ford a brash 29yearold rocker whos posed for publicity 
photos wearing nothing more than her guitar may or may not have 
benefited from her particular form of advertising but shes 
leaving little in her career to chance 
shes taken lessons from vocal coaches and called on wellknown 
producer and writer mike chapman to add his pop sheen to her songs 
chapman who produced much of blondies best work helped ford 
write some of her material and convinced his friend mick smiley 
to give her the song kiss me deadly 
the love or lust song with a chiming melody and metallic 
crunch made it all the way to no 12 on the billboard top 40 chart 
and the video earned ford a nomination for best video of the year 
by a female artist suzanne vegas luka beat her for the trophy 
our main goal on this album was to go gold and were almost 
platinum so we definitely accomplished what we were looking to 
accomplish said ford whose first record for rca has already 
sold about 800000 copies its not over yet 
ford angrily eschews the label heavy metal but shes 
cowritten songs on lita with two of that genres major stars 
ozzy osbourne and nikki sixx of motley crue 
and shes parlayed her success with the album into opening act 
slots on tours led by metal popsters poison and bon jovi assuring 
her of captive audiences of rabid teenagers for the next few 
months to come 
her songs run the gamut of easilyidentifiable teenage 
emotions with such titles as broken dreams back to the 
cave and fatal passion 
the blunt cant catch me advises a potential boyfriend to 
stay away from strongarm tactics youd better think twice i 
aint no sandra dee ford sings dont think im easy i wasnt 
born blonde 
ford whos pictured on the back cover of her record hoisting a 
belt of silver bullets said she considers herself a role model for 
girls who want to enter the world of rock n roll she advises 
them to toughen up 
if thats what they really want to do just go with it 
dont let any idiots steer you the wrong way she said 
her own career started young at age 16 with the allfemale los 
angeles band the runaways 
the runaways who played punk rock were never big sellers and 
they took their share of critical lumps before breaking up in the 
late 1970s over fights about future direction but they boast two 
successful alumni in ford and joan jett currently riding high 
herself with the hit i hate myself for loving you 
we were all poor but we all loved what we were doing ford 
said of her days with the runaways it was my way of going 
through life 
she said she keeps rocking because its what i do best 
though its not always the easiest career as she watched a road 
crew member drag a cooler of beer and soda across the dressing room 
floor she mused that shell spend her day off horsebackriding 
every business has its ups and downs whether youre a taxi 
driver or a rock n roller she said it gets lonely on the 
road sometimes the guys can pal around with the guys but it gets 
real hard for me to just go out and pal around with the guys 
because im not one of the guys 
although she appreciates the power and excitement of the music 
ford also recognizes its a job leading to a slightly cynical 
view of what shes doing 
its a product its something that you sell she said 
music cigarettes an amp a carpet whats the difference its 
all a material thing that you sell

praise from critics and adoration from 
college students does not pay the rent for novelist fred exley 
he drives a 1974 oldsmobile he bought several months ago for 
600 lives in an apartment over a garage in upstate new york eats 
boiled potatoes and chicken noodle soup and has a will but no 
money 
but the 58yearold author whos first book a fans notes 
is considered an american classic is not looking for people to 
have some kind of corny romantic vision of him 
hes not looking for compassion because he already has composure 
i dont have any sympathy for myself in the sense that this is 
the life i chose for myself nobody chose it for me exley said 
in an interview at a friends house im not without my inner 
peace 
he says without a doubt in his gruff monotone voice that if 
he had wanted he could have been a handsomely paid vice president 
of public relations somewhere waiting to collect a big pension and 
driving a new expensive car instead he chose to roll the 
dice and write literature that has been described as sadly funny 
bonechillingly honest overpowering and passionate 
his new book last notes from home random house 1895 
is his third novel and the conclusion of an autobiographical 
triology that readers had to wait two decades for him to finish 
when exleys first novel was published in 1968 he received rave 
reviews won several awards and seemed on his way to becoming one 
of this countrys great authors seven years later his second 
book pages from a cold island came out to mixed reviews 
neither book sold very well and the excitement disappeared 
he didnt exactly reinvigorate the enthusiasm by taking 13 years 
to write last notes a period when he struggled with trying to 
figure out how to insert recurring themes into the new novel and to 
convince his publisher that he could complete the book 
now that its finished exley is hoping for a big comeback 
however he certainly isnt going out of his way to encourage the 
success of the book no tv talk shows no barrage of interviews in 
new york city 
in fact as his book starting showing up in book stores across 
the country in september exley was hiding out at the home of a 
former college roommate just outside syracuse ny from his 
apartment on wellesley island located about 30 miles from his 
hometown of watertown ny 
its not that exley is shy or reclusive or that he doesnt want 
to be bothered exley just isnt comfortable dealing with the 
scores of people he considers either phony or pretentious or both 
when college students stumble into the thousand islands club 
after driving all night from columbus ohio to see exley our 
god the author joins his friends in the finger pointing game of 
im not exley hes exley 
when he goes to his favorite bar in manhattan the famous 
literary haunt the lions head and he overhears two customers 
doing the celebritywatcher refrain thats fred exley where 
over there see he gets up and walks out 
last notes has brought exley even more fame 
with such colorful characters as james otwoomey an excessive 
and outrageous irishman who takes exley hostage in hawaii and 
robin glenn a stewardess and pathological liar who marries exley 
the novel is funny downright hilarious at times 
the author believes the book contains some of the funniest and 
most powerful writing hes ever done and that it probably has the 
most commercial appeal of his three novels 
as he talks his words are preceded and followed by various 
profanities used as tools of humor not anger his doleful and 
penetrating brown eyes usually look away 
his books tell the story of fred exley the alcoholic son of a 
watertown sports legend who travels from mental hospitals to 
taverns to living room couches to hawaii seeking fame and 
selfawareness 
while many of the events in the books from the electric shock 
therapy to two divorces to trying to shoot his teenage twin sister 
with an antique rifle are based on reality exley said hes never 
written a word about himself 
autobiography is impossible it never occurred to me to do 
that he said when i started out i said why do it that 
way i thought this would be different 
it doesnt matter how much of the book is true yes the author 
likes to drink vodka yes he likes attractive women yes he plays 
golf and yes hes a male chauvinist but the character is 
fictional 
from the letters i get i know that a lot of people dont 
understand that they dont realize i was employing a novelistic 
technique exley said they think im hunched over the 
typewriter with a water glass full of vodka sloshed when i write 
he said hes not guilty of drinking while writing ive never 
written a line even with a hangover 
because he shares the same name and similar life with his main 
character many people who read exley believe they know him like 
the nextdoor neighbor college students in particular they 
affectionately and fondly write to him telling him how insightful 
and perceptive he is then they leave large blocks of space for 
his reply 
what theyre asking you to do is write their term paper for 
them those go right in the trash basket exley said they 
think im so lyrical and i sit around and talk about james joyce 
and ernest hemingway when actually i go to the bar and talk 
about the same thing that the college girls father who sells 
refrigerators talks about 
exley warns readers to stay on their toes with the closing scene 
of last notes 
robin who has been cited for her endless delusions and lies 
seems to add a final fantasy to the heap by telling exley she can 
surf quite well exley of course believes it to be another wild 
tale 
but then she climbs on the surfboard in her grandmothers 
wedding gown and effortlessly puts on a surfing exhibition 
robin who lies all the time obviously doesnt maybe exley 
the author who writes about himself all the time doesnt either 
perhaps the insistence of equating the character with the author 
will subside anyway now that exley is working on his fourth book 
a spy thriller that will introduce a new main character dan 
gunther a st lawrence university professor and exgreen beret 
im sick and tired of that exley guy he said 
will this new book take 13 years to finish 
no way i aint gonna live 13 years

bob bailey has been fired by jim bakker 
and appeared in the movie animal house 
his odyssey now continues in nashville where he sings rhythm and 
blues in a city more famous for its country licks and 
cryinyourbeer weepers he has a new wellcrafted album bob 
bailey with his version of marvin gayes inner city blues 
and stevie wonders heaven help us all 
the lp is the latest addition to baileys bulging resume that 
darts from the silver screen to the ptl club to the nashville 
recording studios 
thirteen years ago bailey was singing in a nightclub in eugene 
ore when the late john belushi walked in and asked him to play a 
bit part in animal house bailey played piano in the movie as a 
member of the band otis day and the knights a band that also 
included guitarist robert cray later to become a top rock singer 
and musician 
he was a nice man the 32yearold bailey recalled about 
belushi he was out of control even back then several times they 
delayed production so he could get his thoughts together he loved 
to party 
he was a gifted performer and in the way he handled himself in 
front of the camera he was a master 
in 1978 bailey began a threeyear stint as a singer on the ptl 
club on television he was one of seven members of the ptl singers 
and did some solos 
he was fired in 1981 for refusing to sing on sundays his day 
off in the music department of a new ptl church in charlotte nc 
bailey has mixed memories of jim and tammy bakker the leaders 
of the ptl ministry at that time and stars of the ptl club show 
i think both jim and tammy were quite covetous of their 
stardom and were not willing to share it with anyone he said in 
an interview i think they misunderstood the concept of family 
and that when one aspect or one member of the body does well it 
reflects on everybody and doesnt take away from anybody they were 
afraid their stardom or their position was being threatened by 
myself and others 
but on the other side they could be very warm giving 
supportive people they were extremely kind to me and others on the 
singing staff 
it was a marvelous learning opportunity for me both 
spiritually and musically and otherwise this was one of the best 
if not the best examples of how to do live television 
after leaving the ptl show he moved to nashville and continued 
singing gospel music in 1981 he released his first album a 
gospel lp titled looking forward then in 1984 he was a 
finalist for a grammy award in gospel music for his second album 
im walkin 
it was an interesting year said bailey a native of 
middletown ohio who was raised in portland ore 
bailey a native of middletown ohio who was raised in 
portland ore also participated in the exaltation album that 
won a dove award from the gospel music association for best worship 
lp 
he developed his songwriting talents and planned his move into 
the rhythm and bluesurban contemporary field a step previously 
undertaken by such stars as aretha franklin sam cooke and al green 
the first single release from his current album is project 
girl which carries a message of hope to young people born into 
ghetto poverty the song has the compelling line she might be 
poor but she aint cheap 
i believe in music with a message bailey said i believe 
in the power of music it reaches peoples lives that can not be 
reached otherwise i want to be positive and sing songs that 
inspire people and change their lives

threeyearold stephanie rendons world is dark 
and muffled but she and other deafblind children are getting some 
help they need to reach out and take the risks that lead to 
learning 
stephanie already speaks a few words signs about 15 is slowly 
learning how to walk and is being toilet trained all major 
accomplishments for a child born without any hearing or sight 
whose bright mind is difficult to reach 
most with her handicaps remain helpless passive individuals 
unable to do anything but express the most basic needs 
it is difficult to teach profoundly deafblind children 
communication and language so they function far below their 
potential and usually as a retarded individual said cathee m 
christensen a san diego state university associate professor of 
communicative disorders 
christensen runs an experimental program at san diego state 
aimed at finding out how to motivate deafblind children to learn 
four of about 25 profoundly deafblind san diego county children 
are participating in the program this year with another four 
joining next year 
the education department which is spending 286000 for two 
years on the program freeman many 
more children may not be included in that figure because states 
report them under the category multiple severely handicapped 
the helen keller national center in new york estimates there are 
between 30000 and 40000 deaf and blind adults in the united 
states said freeman 
helen keller who became deaf and blind after a serious illness 
at 19 months went on to speak read earn a college degree and 
become a writer but that was a different story she had a few 
years where she had hearing and sight said christensen all 
the kids we work with had nothing at all 
a deafblind persons success in education depends on 
intelligence quality of education level of parents involvement 
whether training began at an early age and if they have any 
residual hearing or sight said freeman 
children who are deaf and blind have so little data of sensory 
stimulus you have to start out at ground zero you have to 
experiment to determine what motivates them what works it takes a 
lot of time a lot of patience 
these children dont have concepts they come to school 
without knowing what a square is or a ball but before you 
teach them the concept of the mirror you must establish some kind 
of common link once you establish that you can start their 
education 
thats where christensens program comes in 
with a studentteacher ratio of 13 it allows more personal 
attention than is normal in programs for handicapped children she 
said 
much of the childrens time is spent in a laboratory classroom 
where teachers use such devices as a handheld microphone that 
vibrates to sound waves or puzzles made of various textured pieces 
new teaching devices also are being developed through the 
colleges electrical and computer engineering department for 
example a musical walker was built to encourage stephanie who 
wears hearing aids and responds to music to walk 
parents participate during the twiceweekly instruction and 
staff members make regular home visits therapy sessions are 
videotaped and the childrens oral and physical communication signs 
are analyzed 
already there have been some revelations christensen said food 
failed as a motivator while a swimming pool and a trampoline 
worked wonders 
standing with help from her gymnastics instructor during a 
recent session stephanie swayed to the reggae beat of a childrens 
album before being led to a minitrampoline for jumping exercises 
that will strengthen her leg muscles so she can walk alone 
later in the pool the toddler held by a swimming 
instructorcommunications student slowly dragged her tongue a 
chief sensory tool through the water she stopped briefly to 
cough up swallowed water smiled and then continued 
meanwhile george garcia a skinny 9yearold who a year ago 
refused to do anything alone but lie down jumped off a diving 
board in the pools deep end oblivious to a crowd of children 
watching him in awe 
this program helps them to learn what is beyond their physical 
appendages christensen said it teaches them about exploration 
of the environment about what they can do with their bodies my 
theory is that will all come out enhancing cognitive and linguistic 
development 
besides being fun for stephanie the exercise is building up her 
muscles which are generally underdeveloped in deafblind children 
because they dont move much on their own said her mother janet 
rendon for her the exercise has been fantastic 
georges mother mary garcia credits the physical program with 
inspiring her son to more independence he recently climbed steps 
into a bus by himself a motor development skill he perfected on 
the pools ladder 
hes more active mrs garcia said hes come a long way 
stephanie who hears somewhat muffled sounds through her hearing 
aid says hi dadda and mama and signs such words as 
eat water music bath up down 
happy sad and no 
george began therapy at age 3 and also wears a hearing aid he 
says a few words and signs about a dozen to express basic needs 
but understands many more christensen said 
i would have loved to see george at stephanies age to see 
whether he was a passive nonlearner at that point or whether 
sitting at a desk or being treated as a retarded child has affected 
him to the point where he doesnt have the same spark that 
stephanie does 
georges mother has been ill limiting how much energy she could 
put into shuttling him to school and therapy christensen said 
mrs rendon on the other hand has made her only childs education 
a fulltime job while her husband james works as a landscape 
foreman 
ive always had high expectations for her the moment i found 
out she was deaf and blind made me love her probably more than a 
normal child said mrs rendon who hopes stephanie will become a 
selfsufficient communicating adult 
in the meantime she accepts compliments from strangers about 
her cute bright daughter but adds they dont see the pain and 
anguish that went into making her the sweet little person she is

giving voice commands to a computer 
batia directed her hand to shakily write out good morning in 
hebrew 
a small accomplishment but meaningful for the woman who has 
been paralyzed from the neck down since an automobile accident five 
years ago 
batia is one of a small group of quadriplegics at tel hashomer 
hospital working with an experimental computer that has restored 
their ability to make some voluntary movements 
roger natan a mechanical engineering professor at bengurion 
university in beersheba has spent 12 years developing the system 
in which muscles are electrically stimulated by electrodes hooked 
to a computer 
we can write programs to control movement of the arm and to 
get coordinated movements of the muscles said natan from this 
we can do different hand grips 
the patient has control over it using voice commands which 
trigger off programs in the computer 
with simple vocal commands like grip batia grasped a 
felttipped pen with her right hand she tightened her grasp by 
saying more 
we are stimulating about 12 muscles in the arm each one 
individually from our stimulator and we are controlling this from 
our microcomputer natan said 
batias arm resting on a metal support and wrapped in 
electrodes moved haltingly the pen slipped from her hand natan 
put it back 
after a struggle lasting more than a minute she wrote a shakey 
but discernible boker tov or good morning 
i want to do it on my own said batia a former computer 
programmer for the israeli army who declined to give her family 
name for reasons of privacy 
she said the device could be useful for other tasks such as 
reading eating or even cooking but she added it would only be 
possible with hard work and a lot of patience 
natan said he had developed a pressuresensitive pen to 
compensate for uneven lateral movements of the arm brace 
others using the system include an 18yearold man who lost the 
use of his hands in a swimming pool accident and soren hershku a 
soldier paralyzed from the neck down in the 1976 entebbe raid in 
which israeli commandos freed hijacked airline passengers from 
palestinian guerrillas in uganda 
the machine would not help some quadriplegics whose muscles have 
atrophied to the point that they cannot be stimulated by electrical 
impulse natan said generally if theyre not used muscles will 
degenerate in a few years 
the electrical pulses are similar to those the brain normally 
sends to the muscle he said the stimulator gives out brief 
pulses which go in to the electrodes they pass in one electrode 
go through the muscle and out the other electrode the computer 
controls the level of stimulation 
natan 41 an immigrant from london and a specialist in 
biomedical engineering said he is now trying to reduce the 
shelffull of equipment to a shoebox sized unit that can be used 
in the home 
the next stage is to miniaturize the electronics to take 
voice input computer and stimulator boxes and reduce them for a 
portable unit he said adding he hoped to have the job done 
within two years

scattered across leslie m loews desk 
are hundreds of color photographs of a battlefield in which the 
victors devour the vanquished its a microscopic war that has been 
fought for ages and one that has serious consequences for humans 
loew studies the parasitic amoeba so small that 1000 could fit 
on the head of a pin yet so powerful it causes a disease that 
researchers say sickens an estimated 50 million people a year and 
kills as many as 100000 
most people think of the amoeba as the innocuous little 
creature you learn about in school said loew a university of 
connecticut health center physiologist the freshwater amoeba 
that people play with is harmless 
but one form is a parasite that lives in people and causes 
amoebic dysentery it is connected to sanitary conditions it 
occurs in tropical and subtropical climates 
the amoeba is one reason travelers are advised not to drink 
water in foreign countries he said in mexico for instance an 
estimated 6 percent of the people are infected with the cell 
properly known as entamoeba histolytica 
scientists are interested in the parasitic amoeba because of its 
ability to kill other cells if they can understand how it kills 
they may be able to understand for instance how human cells kill 
cancer cells 
loew 41 began his research six years ago at the weizmann 
institute of science in israel with carlos gitler who discovered 
the amoebas holepunching ability loew gets 100000 a year from 
the national institutes of health 
the thing that fascinates is that its a killer on an 
individual cell level said loew who has built a laboratory that 
provides him with a closeup view of the killing his microscope is 
connected to a computer that enlarges and enhances images of the 
cells the images are sent to a still camera and video recorder 
providing photographs and videotape to examine 
the victims appear as small uniform circles that glow brightly 
the amoeba is a much larger darker blob that approaches a cell 
gives a kiss of death and moves on within a short time the 
cell begins to die and fade the amoeba eventually returns engulfs 
the cell and digests it 
an active amoeba can eat up to 10 cells in an hour loew said 
research suggests that the amoeba punches holes in the membrane 
of a cell it has kissed loew said it delivers a little 
packet one part of which includes hole punching material and the 
other part of which is toxins 
scientists know that the holepunching material is a protein 
they know its molecular weight and they know some of its chemical 
properties loew said we have a pretty good handle on it as for 
the toxins we know what they are or we know what they do 
whats missing is an understanding of the mechanics he said 
adding that the knowledge could lead to an understanding of how 
human immune cells kill and possibly the development of cures for 
some diseases

threeyearold stephanie rendons world is dark 
and muffled but she and other deafblind children are getting some 
help they need to reach out and take the risks that lead to 
learning 
stephanie already speaks a few words signs about 15 is slowly 
learning how to walk and is being toilet trained all major 
accomplishments for a child born without any hearing or sight 
whose bright mind is difficult to reach 
most with her handicaps remain helpless passive individuals 
unable to do anything but express the most basic needs 
it is difficult to teach profoundly deafblind children 
communication and language so they function far below their 
potential and usually as a retarded individual said cathee m 
christensen a san diego state university associate professor of 
communicative disorders 
christensen runs an experimental program aimed at finding out 
how to motivate deafblind children to learn the us education 
department which is spending 286000 for two years on the 
program serves about 5520 deafblind children and young adults 
said program specialist charles freeman 
the helen keller national center in new york estimates there are 
between 30000 and 40000 deaf and blind adults in the united 
states said freeman 
a deafblind persons success in education depends on 
intelligence quality of education level of parents involvement 
whether training began at an early age and if they have any 
residual hearing or sight he said 
these children dont have concepts they come to school 
without knowing what a square is or a ball but before you 
teach them the concept of the mirror you must establish some kind 
of common link once you establish that you can start their 
education 
with a studentteacher ratio of 13 christensens program 
allows more personal attention than is normal in programs for 
handicapped children 
much of the time is spent in a laboratory classroom where 
teachers use such devices as a handheld microphone that vibrates 
to sound waves or puzzles made of various textured pieces new 
teaching devices also are being developed through the colleges 
electrical and computer engineering department 
parents participate during the twiceweekly instruction and 
staff members make regular home visits therapy sessions are 
videotaped and the childrens oral and physical communication 
signs are analyzed

giving voice commands to a computer 
batia directed her hand to shakily write out good morning in 
hebrew 
a small accomplishment but meaningful for the women who has 
been paralyzed from the neck down since an automobile accident five 
years ago 
batia is one of a small group of quadriplegics at tel hashomer 
hospital working with an experimental computer that has restored 
their ability to make some voluntary movements roger natan 41 a 
mechanical engineering professor at bengurion university has 
spent 12 years developing the system in which muscles are 
electrically stimulated by electrodes hooked to a computer 
we can write programs to control movement of the arm and to 
get coordinated movements of the muscles said natan from this 
we can do different hand grips the patient has control over it 
using voice commands which trigger off programs in the computer 
the machine would not help some quadriplegics whose muscles have 
atrophied to the point that they cannot be stimulated by electrical 
impulse similar to those the brain normally sends to the muscles

bacteria that can cause an often fatal infection 
in infants and the elderly has been linked to the consumption of 
raw hot dogs and undercooked chicken says a government report 
the us centers for disease control in atlanta found that 
people infected with the bacteria listeria monocytogenes were 
significantly more likely than others to have eaten raw hot dogs or 
undercooked chicken suggesting that those foods were the source of 
the infection 
in a report in the lancet a british medical journal the cdc 
said that infection with listeria or listeriosis was reported in 
154 americans in 1986 and 1987 onethird of the cases occurred in 
newborns who got the infection before birth from their mothers 
the rest occurred in the elderly and in people whose immune systems 
were impaired for other reasons 
twentyeight percent of those infected died the cdc said 
several outbreaks of listeria have attracted wide attention 
during the past few years the outbreaks have occurred in 
vegetables and more often in cheese or other dairy products 
one of the most notable outbreaks which occurred in 1985 in 
california led to 239 illnesses and 81 deaths 
our results add to a growing body of evidence that consumption 
of contaminated food is a risk factor for listeriosis the cdcs 
report said although our findings need to be replicated they 
suggest that undercooked poultry and uncooked hot dogs need to be 
added to a list of foods associated with listeriosis a list that 
already includes vegetables and dairy products

the american academy of pediatrics has 
recommended against structured exercise programs for infants 
saying there is no evidence they promote skills or provide any 
longterm benefit to normal children 
adults may inadvertently exceed an infants physical limitations 
in such programs the academys committee on sports medicine said 
this month in a policy statement 
most programs involve massage techniques and passive exercises 
and some involve the purchase of exercise equipment the academy 
said 
parents do not need specialized skills or equipment to provide a 
stimulating environment which is very important for infant 
development the committee said 
an infant should be provided with opportunities for touching 
holding facetoface contact and minimally structured playing 
with safe toys if these opportunities occur an infants intrinsic 
motivation will guide his or her individual development course 
the committee said 
later in the childs life parents should exercise to set a good 
example prevent televisionwatching from taking up exercise time 
and stress physical activities that the child can continue for a 
lifetime academy president richard narkewicz said in a telephone 
interview 
lifelong activities including cycling jogging swimming 
running fast walking and tennis he said parents should also ask 
schools to stress such activities he said

fifteen nursing home residents will get 
frequent massages in a study aimed at learning if the human touch 
is better than medication in treating depression withdrawal and 
other behavior problems 
previous studies have demonstrated a strong psychological need 
for touch in both humans and animals said dr james dietch a 
psychiatrist at the university of california irvine some 
studies suggest touch may be as important as food 
dietch said his study is meant to determine if inadequate 
physical stimulation contributes to anxiety withdrawal violence 
and depression among elderly nursing home residents suffering 
alzheimers disease or other loss of mental powers 
the study supported by a 15000 grant from the retirement 
research foundation involves 30 patients at the hillhaven special 
care unit a 60bed skilled nursing facility in anaheim 
after two weeks of physical tests and behavioral assessments 15 
of the patients will receive hourlong upper back and shoulder 
massages three or four times weekly for six weeks starting in 
midoctober nurses aides will perform the massages the other 15 
patients wont get massages 
we will try to address such issues as the extent to which 
massage therapy can reduce a patients need for tranquilizing 
medication the optimum amount of therapy needed to produce the 
maximum benefit identification of patients most likely to respond 
to such treatment and the cost effectiveness of the treatment 
dietch said 
sedatives and tranquilizers usually are used to treat behavior 
problems among nursing home patients 
yet studies show that less than half the behaviorally 
disturbed patients who receive these drugs benefit from them and 
many suffer adverse effects such as sedation dizziness and 
increased confusion dietch said these drugs also have been 
shown to increase the risk of falling which can lead to serious 
problems such as hip fractures

children who gave themselves morphine at the 
touch of a button suffered less pain after major surgery than those 
who had to call a nurse for shots a new study says 
the children ages 5 to 15 reported significantly less pain in 
the two days after their operations said researcher edwin dodd 
he reported preliminary study results wednesday at the annual 
meeting of the american society of anesthesiologists dodd 
director of the jackson anesthesia associates pain clinic in 
jackson miss did the work while a fellow at the bowman gray 
school of medicine at wake forest university 
patientcontrolled analgesia has become commonplace for 
adults in the past five years a patient who wants a dose of 
painkiller pushes a button which makes a pump adminster a small 
dose through an intravenous line 
to avoid overdoses the pump puts a minimum amount of time 
between doses in dodds study for example children could get 
morphine no more frequently than once every six minutes 
through random selection half the 20 children in the study were 
hooked up to a pump while the others had the standard treatment of 
calling a nurse for morphine shots they were asked about the 
degree of pain they were feeling right after surgery and in the 
mornings and afternoons of the following two days 
they indicated their degree of pain on a 10point scale that 
featured five faces ranging from a happy one to a crying one 
as expected both groups reported the same amount of pain 
immediately after surgery dodd said but each time they were asked 
in the next two days children on the pump averaged significantly 
less pain than the other children did 
no sign of addiction appeared in children using the pump dodd 
said

hang on to your seatbelts home computing is about to enter its 
teens 
and if the rush of oncoming technology is anything like the rush 
of hormones home computing is going to see changes at least as 
dramatic as puberty and maybe as painful 
figure the beginnings of personal computing from 1975 with the 
introduction of the altair 8800 to 1977 with apple and radio shack 
since the introduction of the ibm pc in 1981 the notion of a 
personal computer has become commonplace and the very idea of 
having one no longer draws much attention now the focus is what 
the machines will do 
for all the talk from hobbyists who have figured out ways to 
computerize everything from sundials to switches personal 
computers for most of us do four things they process words they 
count money they play games they file things 
word processing financial spreadsheets games and data bases 
all existed before personal computers they were called 
typewriters calculators and pencils board games and filing 
cabinets putting a computer to work on those tasks enhanced them 
in some ways and made them easier to perform but didnt basically 
change them a handcalculated spreadsheet is exactly like a 
computercalculated spreadsheet the difference being drudgery 
the next few years of personal computing may see something 
different springing from three major and interrelated developments 
the tremendous growth of processing power data storage and 
handling techniques and interconnectivity may contribute to 
fundamental changes in many areas of ordinary life 
take processing power the raw ability of a computer to handle 
information it has two ordinary measurements the speed at which 
the computer performs instructions and the number of bits binary 
digits the machine is able to handle at once 
the last 10 years or so have seen a change from machines that 
could process around 800000 instruction per second and handle 8 
bits at a time to machines that rip through 20 million instructions 
per second and handle 32 bits at a time 
a machine with that power can handle multitasking doing more 
than one job at the same time and can be equipped with very 
sophisticated software it isnt stretching things to say that the 
individual can have more raw computing power sitting on a desktop 
than was available in entire rooms of computer gear not many years 
ago a computer on that level is perfectly capable of running a 
small home business in the basement a terminal for word processing 
and doing a search in a data base all at once 
even with the power of a single chip more power and production 
may be had by grouping the chips and having each of them work on a 
different part of a given task at the same time thats called 
parallel processing and its a computer version of many hands 
make light work 
since its unreasonable to expect that the growth of computing 
power is going to stop it isnt outlandish to begin to wonder 
whether our homes will replace individual computers for family 
members with a central computer just as central heating replaced 
the individual room fireplaces of an earlier time

that processing power increase is matched by new developments in 
the technology of storing and retrieving information cdroms 
compact diskread only memory use lasers to encode and read 
millions of characters of information in tiny pits on the surface 
of a disk easily able to fit into a coat pocket first popularized 
as digital recording of music that wouldnt deteriorate with 
multiple plays cdrom technology can bring inthehome access to 
billions of characters of information a single disk can hold more 
than 500 million characters and referencework disks are already 
being published including groliers encyclopedia 
a system that would allow you to store that many characters of 
information and change any of it at will readwrite has yet to 
hit the marketplace although at least one manufacturer tandy has 
announced plans but even at the readonly level the ability to 
pack so much information in such a small space holds spectacular 
promise teaching and entertainment programs that package realistic 
video sound and computeraided interaction are possible on a level 
formerly reserved for science fiction when the information that 
would require a handtruck load of bound books may fit comfortably 
in pocket or purse 
with the ability to store information escalating the ability to 
search it must keep pace and the developments in hypertext software 
may do that as an idea hypertext dates back to world war ii and 
the term itself was coined more than 20 years ago but this is data 
base software with a difference it allows you to search for things 
in the same way scientists think you think by association 
most data bases are sequential and organized according to some 
artificial and fixed hierarchy perhaps the alphabet or a number 
system a hypertext data base is different topics are linked by 
association so that an examination of the topic apple could 
flow into an examination of either tree or fruit or 
computer or orchards or cider depending upon what you 
wanted to know and what questions that prompted 
a hypertext system hypercard is already included with mac 
plus ii and se computers from apple and other software is 
available for msdos machines 
finally there is the beginning of something dubbed 
interconnectivity defined as the ability to get different 
machines from different mediums to work together and exchange 
information when you receive a facsimile transmission via the 
telephone network on the facsimile board of your personal computer 
and use ocr optical character recognition software andor a 
scanner to convert it into a digital form and then print the result 
out on either a printer or a plotter while storing the information 
on a magnetic disk thats interconnectivity 
interconnectivity is also cellular telephones and midi musical 
instrument digital interface and the smart photocopy machines 
called laser printers being used for desktop publishing its the 
images scanned from a video camera and run through graphics 
software to produce everything from tshirts to art 
interconnectivity is also the beginning of order from the 
oftenchaotic marketplace with the emergence of standards that 
cut across more than one manufacturers product line although 
still in its infancy interconnectivity should bring to gadgetry 
what the interstate highway network brought to personal travel 
ease speed and convenience in moving people things and ideas 
across borders 
of course none of the above may happen it may be back to quill 
pens parchment and candlelight since there isnt a surefire way 
to predict the future of anything as complicated as the application 
of societys technologies to individual lives but if we continue 
in the directions that seem to be now the course cornering the 
goosefeather market for the next several years is probably not a 
great investment

klaus k obermeier used to compute only in his 
office now that he has a laptop computer he computes in the back 
seat of the car on the plane beside the pool and even he admits 
in bed 
obermeier who works for battelle memorial institute in 
columbus ohio is the kind of person who is making laptop models 
into one of the hottest segments of the computer business 
until recently laptop computers tended to be underpowered and 
overpriced with small poorly lit screens and batteries that ran 
out at inconvenient times 
those problems have not been conquered completely but enough 
progress has been made to release a flood of pentup demand among 
business people students writers and others 
sales of laptop computers will surpass 1 billion in the united 
states this year and are growing at a rate of 40 percent annually 
according to dataquest inc a market researcher 
this fall in some ways marks the coming of age of laptop 
computers 
early in october toshiba corps us arm introduced two 
portable computers 
the t5200 which uses intel corps topoftheline 80386 
microprocessor is not a true laptop computer because it cannot run 
on batteries it is also heavier than most laptops at just under 
19 pounds 
the t1600 which is built on intels 80c286 chip can run on 
batteries and weighs in at 116 pounds toshiba called it the top 
of its batterypowered pc line 
the t5200 has a suggested retail price of 9499 to 10999 and 
will be available later this year the t1600 is priced at 4999 
and will be available early next year according to toshiba america 
inc in irvine calif 
nec home electronics usa inc the us arm of japans nec 
corp announced a new line of laptop computers including the 
thinnest lightest one yet a 44pound model that could fit into a 
12inch by 9inch interoffice envelope the ultralite has 90 
percent of the power of the original ibm pc at and starts at 2999 
necs prospeed 386 laptop resembles the highpowered machine 
introduced by toshiba except it is cheaper it can run on batteries 
and it has an optional docking station so it can be used as a 
conventional desktop computer in the office it starts at 7699 
compared to 9499 for toshibas 
compaq computer corp was expected to follow in unveiling a new 
model for the laptop market and analysts say international 
business machines corp will come out soon with a successor to its 
2yearold pc convertible 
as a sign of the markets importance zenith electronics corp 
which dominates the government market for laptops has made the 
machines the linchpin of its entire data systems business 
the laptop market is one that is coming into its own after 
many years of really being a niche market said margaret 
rodenberg vice president of marketing for entre computer centers 
inc a retail chain 
laptop computers have always gotten good press perhaps because 
journalists were some of their earliest users tandy corps radio 
shack trs 80 model 100 even earned an affectionate nickname on the 
campaign trail the trash 80 
but people who needed more computing power shied away from them 
john vanden brink a consultant in des plaines ill said he once 
destroyed an entire data base when he tried to transfer something 
out of his radio shack and exceeded the memory limit 
the newest models in contrast are loaded with power 
the problem with speedy computers is they are ravenous for 
electricity and drain batteries quickly seizing an opportunity 
chips and technologies inc of san jose calif recently 
introduced a set of chips that will double or triple the length of 
time that many laptops can run on batteries 
prices for laptops are relatively high 2000 to 10000 
because of the expense of the batteries energysaving cmos memory 
chips and the complex technology of flat screens 
the flat screens of laptops flip up like the top of a clamshell 
and usually display 25 lines at a time in comparison to the 40 
lines of a regular personal computer brightness and contrast 
although much improved still dont match those of fullsized pcs 
once on the road laptop owners have abundant headaches no 
place to recharge batteries no modular phone jacks hotel phone 
switches that cant handle data transmissions 3inch disks that 
arent compatible with other peoples 5inch disks 
still something keeps laptop users tapping away 
laptops like cellular phones allow people to keep working 
while others are stuck in traffic or thumbing through the inflight 
magazine they also encourage spontaneity by letting people record 
or try out ideas while they are fresh

in a scene from the futuristic movie robocop a shiny silver 
disc is inserted into a playback machine to produce a recorded 
audiovideo message on a wall of television monitors 
video from what looks like a compact disc 
yes and you dont have to wait until the year 2000 to have 
cdvideo in your home actually there were laser videodiscs before 
audio compact discs the videodisc format dates back to 1978 
this year laser video is trying to create a new image its 
being touted as cdvideo a format that offers the best of both 
worlds to audiovideophiles 
like its audio cd cousin the videodiscs offer true digital 
sound on many programs but instead of just music the library of 
videodiscs includes classic and current movies concerts 
educational material and operas 
cdvideo programming appears on discs of three different sizes 
5 8 and 12inch 
the 5inch gold cdvideo singles have a capacity of five 
minutes of digital audio with video plus 20 minutes of additional 
digital audio per side 
programming on the 8 and 12inch discs theyre silvercolored 
are primarily all videoaudio the 8inch discs can hold up to 20 
minutes of both video and audio material per side the 12inch 
discs boost the time to 60 minutes per side 
players currently in playbackonly format are manufactured by 
pioneer magnavox yamaha and sony 
players can be bought for under 500 but one with all the 
frills will list out at about 2000 some of the players use only 
the 8 and 12inch videodiscs but newer combination models 
play all consumer optical discs 
no matter which player is selected the audiovideo quality 
cannot be matched signaltonoise ratio on the audio portion of 
cdvideo players is rated 97 decibels or better the players offer 
420425 lines of horizontal resolution providing an exceptional 
picture 
since the discs are read by a lowpower laser beam there is 
no wear on them 
cdvideo singles list for about 10 with feature films ranging 
from 35 to 50 in many instances a movie on laser video will 
cost less than videotape 
cdvideo also offers jitterfree freeze frame and slow motion 
plus a variety of other programming capabilities pick out a 
favorite song from an entire concert on a 12inch disc and the 
player can search it out in a matter of seconds and play it 
consumers can also program a player to scan for a single frame of a 
movie and freeze it on the screen 
a search through a cdvideo brochure reveals art collections and 
an encyclopedia as well as games and programs from nasa national 
geographic and other special interest discs

electronics fans seem to be getting a chance 
to pause and catch their breath this year a time between surges in 
technology 
the most popular innovations of recent years compact disc 
players and videocasette recorders are now in millions of homes 
indeed sales of videocasette recorders have dipped for the first 
time 
and the items expected to mark the next great tides on the 
market digital audio tapes and high definition television 
arent yet on the market 
in the past year theres been nothing really new but theres 
been sort of a penetration on all levels of whats out there 
commented electronics writer peter mcwilliams 
mark v rosenker of the electronic industries association 
stressed the continuing tremendous markets for stereo color 
television compact disc and other items that have become popular 
in the last couple of years 
vcrs have grown up they are in more than half the homes in 
america he said and now attention is turning to the innovations 
of the future particularly high definition television 
consumers are improving what they have moving up to a better 
more complex versions of vcrs and other items but theres no 
product that retailers are worried about being able to keep in 
stock for christmas reported the author of peter mcwilliams 
personal electronics book 
producers sold 132 million vcrs last year down from 135 
million the year before the electronic industries association 
reports the first decline in sales for these popular devices 
that probably indicates that most of the folks initially 
interested in such new technology have a vcr commented mcwilliams 
but that doesnt meen sales will fall sharply he added since 
this is a time when many people will want to move up to a better 
model 
prices have fallen mcwilliams noted so many people will be 
shopping for vcrs with more features others confronted with a 
possibly large repair bill for an older set will likely decide to 
buy a new more sophisticated model he added 
this years consumer electronics show was kind of dull said 
mcwilliams whats out there is getting better and better but 
he found nothing so new that everyone is going to want to run out 
and buy it 
one minor chance for a trend he said is portable video small 
televisionvcr combinations being produced by sony and casio which 
people can take with them on trips but mcwilliams added these 
are new and thus costly 
video games have made a strange resurgence this year he 
added they have kind of revitalized the whole video game market 
that surprised a lot of people 
sales seem to be doing best among kids that dont remember 
that video games arent popular any more so they want them he 
added also some makers have begun marketing golden oldies 
video games such as pong in forms than can be played on more 
modern machines 
another curiosity he said is a resurgence in video discs 
which seems to be being pushed by sony 
rosenkers emphasis was on the future with standard setting now 
under way for the improved highdefinition television systems 
the system could offer pictures with double the clarity of those 
now available but arent likely to hit the marketplace until 1992 
or later he said 
meanwhile audio combination units are proving popular allowing 
consumers to buy a product that includes a compact disc player 
tape player and radio sales are strong and growing for home 
computers cordless telephones and microwave ovens also as well as 
electronic toys home security systems and other products

while video purveyors promote sharper pictures and bigger 
screens audio manufacturers are shouting about sounds that try to 
reproduce the movie theater experience at home 
the operative word is surround 
as the quality of televisions and vcrs continue to improve 
consumers are looking for better performance from their audio 
products as well says brian williams director of product 
planning and merchandising for nec home electronics 
he says that more than 1400 movies in the home video market 
have been recorded in dolby surround sound increasing the demand 
for products that can recreate movie theater sound effects at home 
surround sound technology uses a minimum of four speakers 
decoders amplifiers and receivers connect directly into most 
existing home audio systems williams says 
there are other types of highquality video speakers as well a 
recent issue of video magazine analyzed them 
powered a powered speaker is one with a builtin amplifier 
the main advantage of having a speaker with an amplifier builtin 
is that it can be plugged into the audio output of any audiovideo 
component even one without an amplifier making for elegantly 
simple audio systems powered speakers range in price from 200 to 
380 per pair 
cordless video speakers you can hang on a wall or perch on 
bookshelves without unsightly cables or wires trailing behind them 
cordless speakers employ a number of techniques to achieve their 
cordlessness including an infrared transmitter that plugs into 
the headphone jack of an audio amp or a monitorreceiver it sends 
audio signals to the speakers which must be located within the 
line of sight 
shielded speakers are those that lend themselves to video use 
without unduly sacrificing audio quality speakers not shielded for 
use near a tube cant be moved close to the set shielded speakers 
are manufactured by fisher nec pioneer quasar rca sony and 
technics among others and range in price from 50 to 1000 a 
pair without a shield the magnet inside the speaker can distort 
the video picture and bend or change the color 
and for those whod like to eliminate any physical appearance of 
speakers from their living rooms pioneer offers the bssf1 
bodysonic chair retailing for about 2000 its a cushy black 
leather swivel chair with 32inch diaphragm ear speakers and a 
subwoofer in the seat it has its own surround sound processor

only about half the adults who have a computer 
at home actually use it as opposed to nearly threequarters of all 
children the census bureau reports 
youngsters use computers for learning and for games and many 
children are also exposed to the machines in school said bureau 
statistician robert kominski 
even though many adults use computers at work the home computer 
may have been bought by one adult for a specific use and not be of 
interest to others in the home kominski suggested 
in addition many computers were bought as learning tools and 
game machines for children he said so there probably are 
quite a few situations in households where children use a computer 
and not the adults at all 
the report was based on a survey taken in october 1984 the only 
time the bureau has looked at computer use the report was delayed 
because of other priorities he said 
computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million home 
computers in use at the time of the survey 
international data corp a bostonbased market research group 
estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly 
165 million as of last year 
electronic industries association a trade group estimates the 
total at 176 million homes as of january 
while it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use the 
census analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses the 
machines 
of 221 million americans aged 3 and over in 1984 more than one 
in five 211 percent reported using computers in some direct 
way 
among children aged 3 to 17 153 percent had a computer at 
home and 742 percent of those used it of those enrolled in 
school 28 percent reported using computers 
among youngsters the study found boys generally use computers 
more than girls 
if you want to risk saying anything is a sociocultural 
difference at this time thats certainly where it lies kominski 
said people who study computer games find boys use these things 
much more than girls do they go to video parlors more and they 
use computers more at home and school too

american schools have only one computer for 
every 30 students and even those pupils with access to computers 
get to use them an average of just one hour a week according to a 
report to congress 
the report by the congressional office of technology assessment 
said todays classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50 
years ago more closely than operating rooms or business offices 
resemble their 1938 versions 
the agency estimated that schools have spent 2 billion on 
computer hardware over the past decade there are now 12 million 
to 17 million computers in public schools and fewer than 5 
percent have no computers 
but the agency said it would cost 4 billion to buy enough 
equipment to reduce the studentcomputer ratio from 30to1 to 
3to1 
the 246page report based on two years research said that 
between 1981 and 1987 the percentage of schools equipped with 
computers for instructional use grew from 18 percent to 95 percent 
but the vast majority of schools still do not have enough of 
them to make the computer a central element of instruction it 
said 
computers are not the only new machines in american classrooms 
the 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use of 
advanced technology of all types the report said 
in 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders today 
roughly 90 percent do it said adding that the availability of 
cable and satellite transmission has made the television a more 
potent teaching tool especially for schools in remote areas 
in practice there is wide disparity one computer in a 
classroom clusters of computers in the library or classrooms full 
computer laboratories and classrooms with no computers it said 
not all students use computers and those who do spend on 
average a little more than one hour per week on the computer 
the report said that although new interactive technologies 
cannot alone solve the problems of american education they have 
already contributed to important improvements in learning these 
tools can plan an even greater role both by helping children 
acquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticated 
skills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over their 
lifetimes 
it said there are more than 10000 educational software products 
on the market but the quality could be much better 
the office of technology assessment is a nonpartisan analytical 
agency for congress the report was commissioned by the house 
committee on education and labor

taking a cue from the automobile industry some companies are 
beginning to offer extended warranty packages on consumer 
electronics products 
some offer packages that can cover the component for up to three 
years after purchase of the videocassette recorder television 
tuner or other home electronics product 
dealers like them says robert p minnick president of 
componentguard inc of the plans because they add an attractive 
dimension to their sales effort and the customer is secure in the 
knowledge that if the product fails within the contracted period it 
will be serviced and repaired at no cost 
componentguard is an extended warranty service plan company 
headquartered in new york 
the plans vary minnick says with some designed to cover high 
quality equipment and others providing a tollfree 
customerassistance telephone number for troubleshooting damages 
basic service plans might cover parts and labor on lower end 
items while more comprehensive plans take the warranty coverage 
further one componentguard plan for example offers a guarantee 
that the covered product will meet the original manufacturers 
specifications 
most independent warranty companies are backed by insurance 
firms says minnick providing more investment security

an estimated 2 million homes in america have satellite tv 
systems with access to some 150 channels of programming says 
chuck hewitt president of the satellite broadcasting and 
communications association of america sbca who estimates there 
could be 10 million by the mid1990s 
by then he says todays 8to10foot will have given way to 
smaller 18to24inch dishes 
the cost for an average system says hewitt is about 2500 
hewitt says satellite tv owners can receive 5300 sporting 
events a year as well as movies childrens and family programs 
news weather concerts stock market information and college 
courses 
private homes or buses arent the only receivers many private 
television networks have been established to provide outlets for 
business and ninprofit corporations 
ive been amazed at how many churches have used memorial funds 
to purchase a satellite dish said pat correll of the united 
methodist churchs network in nashville tenn she said 25000 
sunday school leaders recently viewed a threesession workshop 
aired at 350 sites nationwide the jc penney merchandising chain 
is equipping 650 of its largest stores with satellite dishes 
there are 12000 receiving sites with satellite dishes around 
the country up from several hundred a few years ago said elliott 
gold publisher of business tv magazine in altadena calif he 
predicts 42000 locations by 1992 
receiving sites cost about 5000 apiece to build sending sites 
to beam the signal to a satellite run 200000 to 300000 said 
louis bransford of the public service satellite consortium 
comprised of churches trade groups educators and health 
organizations using television 
one obstacle to the growth of the home satellite industry has 
been the issue of piracy 
federal communications commission official richard smith 
recently estimated that nearly half of the satellite dishes used to 
receive pay tv programs have illegal devices that unscramble the 
picture and let the viewer watch for free 
if unchecked fcc chairman dennis r patrick has said the 
growth of the illegal chips threaten the viability of the 
satellitetohome program market 
 
patrick has said the devices not only steal from those who 
created the programming but from viewers who pay for the service 
and may lose it if the problem is not brought under control

home video is an integral part of most american households 
today with some 60 percent of american households having a 
videocassette recorder but its not that long ago that home video 
was in its infancy 
a recent issue of video magazine recounted the milestones in the 
short history of video 
the first practical videotape recorder was introduced at the 
national association of radio and television broadcasters 
convention in the early 50s says video the ampex vtr was almost 
as big as a room and cost more than 100000 making it practical 
only for professional use 
after many attempts to develop a consumeracceptable home taping 
system sony finally delivered the sl7200 in 1975 kicking off the 
home video revolution with a maximum onehour taping time and no 
prerecorded video available to speak of owners of the new sony 
vcr were restricted to taping programs off broadcast television 
victor co of japan a subsidiary of matsushita debuted its 
competing vhs format the following year 
prerecorded movies appeared in 1980 when magnetic video signed 
with 20th century fox to distribute 50 movies these included 
patton the french connection hello dolly the sound 
of music and butch cassidy and the sundance kid it would be 
a few more years before video stores and rental videos began to 
appear 
the first home video cameras were introduced in 1980 reports 
video magazine 
in the fall of 1983 the first camcorder appeared on the scene 
the sony bmc110 betamovie camcorder combined all the taping 
essentials camera vcr record only and power source in a

a national cable television center and 
museum has opened to preserve the roots of an industry that in 40 
years has gone from using simple wires leading from a shared 
antenna to satellites 
more than 30 past and present cable television executives and 
cable tv aficionados gathered at the opening of the center and 
museum at penn state university oct 4 
among the displays at the museum are an old rca television with 
gauges added to measure the strength of a cable signal a model of 
the first satellite uplink truck papers photographs and other 
memorabilia 
the center also includes a room with oral histories from cable 
pioneers and information about cable companies around the country 
a viewing room for a videotape collection now being gathered and a 
conference room 
marlowe froke a penn state professor and the centers director 
said students taking courses in cable television and scholars would 
get a good idea of the industrys history from the exhibits 
it provides a dramatic visualization of some of the history of 
the industry that couldnt be captured in conventional textbooks 
froke said 
benjamin j conroy jr chairman of the board of the museum 
said he hoped the museum would expand beyond its temporary location 
in a building basement 
while this is a good start its only a beginning said 
conroy who is from austin texas he said he hoped the museum one 
day would occupy a building or at least its own wing in a building 
since the early cable stations the industrys technical 
knowhow and audience has increased dramatically 
cable television began in 1948 in pennsylvania and oregon and 
quickly spread to remote communities across the country that 
couldnt pick up standard tv signals 
microwave was used in cable television for the first time in 
1953 and experimental satellite systems were tested in 1973 as the 
number of viewers increased 
more than 42 million viewers in 20000 communities now receive 
cable television close to 60 percent of all tv viewers 
most of the funding for the museum and center came from cable 
television pioneers national cable televisions association and 
community antenna television association

millions of eyes today are focused on computer monitors or video 
display terminals whether at work home or school 
while studies have shown no indications that these monitors 
cause vision problems the american optometric association has some 
advice on ways to reduce eye stress and fatigue when working on the 
terminals with prolonged concentration 
take a 10 or 15minute rest break every hour 
use glasses with a mild near vision prescription for wear only 
when using the video display terminal 
room lighting for video display terminal work should be about 
half that recommended for general office work or a 30 to 
50footcandle level about the equivalent of a 60watt bulb in a 
small room 
the light source should not reflect directly on the screen 
for maximum comfort and ease of seeing flexibility is the 
key you should be able to adjust the table chair screen 
brightness and contrast monitor position and keyboard to meet 
individual needs 
copyholders should be adjustable to hold reference material at 
the same height and distance as the screen eliminating the need to 
change focus when looking from one to the other

the television of the future will be a high definition system 
with the clarity of movie film and the sound of compact discs say 
representatives of the broadcast and electronics industries 
the federal communications commission recently endorsed the 
advanced television systems declaring them in the public interest 
and approving some preliminary rules for bringing them into 
american homes 
but the commission said many technical and procedural problems 
still must be ironed out and the systems probably will not be 
available from the us broadcast industry before 1993 
us broadcasters are concerned that us research efforts to 
develop an industry transmission standard for high definition tv 
may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable japanese 
invasion of the new technology 
the japanese have been working on an advanced system for two 
decades and expect to introduce high definition tv to homes in 
their country in 1990 
the picture on a standard television set in the united states is 
produced by a signal that scans more than 200000 dots on 525 
lines the japanese system has 1125 scanning lines 
michael rau national association of broadcasters vice president 
for science and technology said the fcc made a strong commitment 
to bring advanced tv to the public they seemed to reaffirm support 
for free overtheair broadcasting but the commission must solve 
the difficulties of delivering the system over broadcast outlets 
in a series of preliminary rulings the fcc said 
existing broadcasters and stations are best equipped to bring 
the new system to viewers 
advanced television programs must be received on existing 
television sets so viewers wont have to replace their equipment 
if additional frequency space is needed it should be found 
within existing vhf and uhf television bands the fcc found that 
looking for frequencies outside those bands would delay the 
service and noted that bands now suitable for the systems are in 
use for other purposes

deere amp co says its new threeyear contract 
with the united auto workers will keep the farm machinery maker 
competitive while also giving union members their first pay raise 
since 1981 
it gives us a framework to successfully operate in a very 
competitive environment deere spokesman robert combs said sunday 
after union members ratified the pact giving them a raise better 
retirement benefits and increased job security 
the ratification followed months of negotiations and prevented a 
repeat of the bitter fivemonth strike in 198687 that ended with

the new contract which covers 13500 employees in illinois 
iowa atlanta minneapolis and denver takes effect immediately 
uaw secretarytreasurer bill casstevens said it was approved by 
a 90 percent margin but the union declined to give the actual vote 
totals 
the contract gives workers at deere the nations leading 
manufacturer of farm implements an average pay raise of 443 cents 
an hour in the first year followed by lumpsum payments equal to 3 
percent of their base salary in each of the second and third years 
average earnings under the old contract were 1547 per hour or 
32177 a year based on a 40hour week 
deeres union workforce has not received a general pay raise 
since 1981 the company has given costofliving increases using a 
formula tied to the consumer price index 
the contract also calls for a threestep increase in early 
retirement benefits the monthly pension benefit for those on early 
retirement go from 1205 to 1400 the first year to 1500 the 
second year and 1600 in the third 
the union also won important safeguards protecting workers from 
layoff 
the union now plans to resume contract negotiations with 
caterpillar inc 
caterpillar a leading manufacturer of earthmoving equipment 
and the union agreed to extend their contract originally set to 
expire sept 30 until the deere talks were completed 
the caterpillar contract affects 17500 factory workers in five 
states

investors staggered by last years stock 
market crash still are trying to sort through their finances 
unable to get complaints against their brokers resolved state 
securities regulators say 
two out of three small investors who experienced problems during 
the stock market crash have not been able to get a resolution of 
their complaints according to the findings of a survey released 
sunday 
the north american securities administrators association said 
its survey also showed that 82 percent of investors now have less 
confidence in securities markets and one out of every seven 
investors has left the market entirely 
a lot of people with unresolved complaints dont know where to 
go for help said john baldwin the new president of the 
association which represents state regulatory offices our 
survey shows that these burned investors are not rushing back into 
the arms of wall street 
of those still in the market 29 percent said they had 
substantially less money invested now and twothirds said they had 
changed or were planning to change brokerage firms 
baldwin director of the utah securities division said it was 
important for investors to know what help was available to get 
complaints resolved he called it particularly disturbing that 40 
percent of investors who had incomes of 30000 a year or less had 
taken no action to resolve their complaints suggesting a lack of 
sophistication among these investors about how to proceed 
baldwin said a good place to seek help is the securities 
regulatory bureau in the state where the investor lives baldwin 
said state regulators often are able to get results simply by 
getting the brokerage firm and the investor together to discuss the 
problem 
he said taking the case through arbitration or filing a court 
suit are also options although timeconsuming the survey found 
that of the cases which had gone to court 90 percent were still 
pending while 87 percent of the arbitration cases were unresolved 
the association which released the survey results at its 
convention in santa fe nm said the typical respondent was a 
male aged 55 or older with a gross income of around 30000 who 
had lost between 1000 and 5000 in the stock market crash 
half of the respondents to the survey complained that their 
brokers executed trades late or got them wrong during the hectic 
period surrounding the oct 19 crash 
the next most common gripes were that brokers had misled 
investors or put them in unsuitable investments such as highly 
risky ventures for a customer without a lot of money to lose 
asked about the disposition of their complaints 64 percent of 
those responding said their problems were still unresolved only 
36 percent had been lucky enough to get a resolution in less than 
one month 
the survey turned up a number of horror stories from what 
baldwin termed the invisible victims of black monday 
an elderly woman in wausau wis wrote i have lost 5000 
and it hurts because i lost my husband in march 1988 and depended 
on him for support the social security check does not cover all 
the expenses in a month 
a florham park nj housewife said she had lost 50000 
invested in stocks commenting even if i were in a financial 
position to invest now i would never put my money anywhere but in 
the bank i could never have faith in brokers again 
a retiree in cape gable fla said he had lost basically 
everything and had been forced to go back to work to earn 
enough to live on 
a new york city public relations man wrote this continues 
to be one of the most painful situations ive ever experienced to 
have lost so much money which was hardearned and difficult to 
save and to feel that i have nowhere to go for help and dont know 
how to rectify the problem or recoup the loss 
not all investors had complaints a port orange fla man said 
his discount brokerage house had returned 6500 to him to cover 
the full amount of loss because his sell order on oct 20 1987 
had been mishandled 
the survey was based on responses to questionnaires mailed to 
2500 callers selected at random from 15000 investors who have 
used a hotline set up following the crash by the nasaa a total of 
829 investors returned the mailed surveys

merv griffins organization said today it had 
given itself an option to drop its bid for resorts international 
inc a move that could give it leverage to lower its takeover 
offer 
we have not made any decision that were going to terminate 
on the other hand were not giving them any assurance that the 
deal is going to go forward said thomas gallagher a spokesman 
for griffin co 
griffin is offering 36 a share for resorts which owns resorts 
international casino hotel in atlantic city nj and vast real 
estate holdings there as well as a casino and property in the 
bahamas 
under his plan griffin would take the company private by buying 
out all the stock including that held by billionaire developer 
donald trump 
griffins latest move could be a signal that the millionaire and 
former talkshow host believes he can get resorts at a lower price 
by threatening to withdraw from the deal altogether 
griffins acquisition depends on several conditions including 
approvals by the new jersey casino control commission and 
authorities in the bahamas 
one key approval was granted last week by the internal revenue 
service the casino control commission was scheduled to vote 
tuesday regarding griffins eligibility to hold a casino license in 
new jersey 
the latest deadline for completion of the acquisition was 
allowed to expire last friday without extension griffin said that 
means that any party to the deal is free to terminate its 
obligations at any time 
in a separate matter griffins organization said it had decided 
that if it does complete the acquisition it will be by means of a 
merger rather than a tender offer the amount paid to shareholders 
36 a share in cash is not affected by the decision 
a merger offer was approved on aug 30 by the requisite number 
of shareholders griffin said 
the proposal calls for griffin to pay trump 135 a share or 96 
million for trumps class b stock trump also would receive 
another 63 million from griffin to break trumps management 
agreement with resorts 
griffins tender offer for holders of class a stock would cost 
him 2052 million griffin would also invest 50 million in 
resorts to help it generate enough cash flow to cover interest 
payments on resorts debt 
in turn trump would pay resorts 273 million for the 
unfinished 1250room taj mahal casino which is next door to the 
resorts international casino hotel and is owned by resorts

go into any business and look past the 
desks the computers the file cabinets the telephones and chances 
are youll find a copier 
its a machine thats taken for granted now that copiers have 
found their way into schools shopping centers and even homes 
but it was just 50 years ago on oct 22 1938 that chester 
f carlson a patent worker invented the process thats at the 
heart of every copier 
his discovery of xerography the dry method for making 
duplicates helped give birth to the billiondollar xerox corp 
now based in stamford conn and in the process changed the way 
the world communicates 
in the history of mankind there were very few revolutions in 
communications and they all led to the democratization of the 
media the last big revolution prior to carlson was gutenbergs 
invention said paul a strassman a former xerox vice president 
now working as an author teacher and consultant in new canaan 
george white vice president for research at the university of 
pittsburgh and another former xerox vice president agreed that 
carlsons invention was as important as johannes gutenbergs 
invention of printing with moveable type in the 15th century but 
he said it also enabled all workers to participate in business 
communications and established the office supplies business as a 
multibilliondollar market 
it liberated the personal initiatives of everyone in the paper 
stream you didnt have to write a book to distribute your notes 
you could type them up and distribute them by xerography he said 
this freedom is something that doesnt exist with other office 
equipment including the personal computer white said using a 
copier requires no training little expense and time and works in 
all languages this is particularly important in such countries as 
japan where copiers are immensely important because of the 
complexity of their written language he said 
it is probably culturally unbiased more than anything else you 
can think of white said 
dataquest inc a market research firm in san jose calif 
estimates that more than 48 million copiers were in use in the 
united states last year combined the machines produced an 
estimated 490 billion copies and generated revenues in excess of 
15 billion according to dataquest 
what makes the numbers truly astounding is that the first 
easytouse office copier wasnt marketed until 1960 when xerox 
introduced its famous 914 model the machines name was derived 
from the fact that it produced a copy as large as 9 inches by 14 
inches 
in between 1938 and 1960 millions of dollars and countless 
hours were spent by carlson and hundreds of other scientists to 
make his invention accessible to everyone 
but the story of xerography actually began while carlson worked 
in the patent office of the pr mallory amp co in new york city 
because of legal requirements numerous copies of patents had to be 
made often by hand carlson who suffered from arthritis 
determined there had to be a better way 
with a physics degree from the california institute of 
technology carlson began researching scientific literature at the 
new york public library this led to experiments at a laboratory he 
built and financed out of his own pocket 
the experiments consisted of putting an electrostatic charge 
into metal plates and then exposing the plates to light in this 
manner he was able to create patterns that could be used in 
printing 
on oct 22 1938 at his laboratory in astoria ny he 
produced his first successful duplicate using this process the 
first words reproduced through xerography said simply 102238 
astoria 
carlson knew he had made a discovery of immense importance but 
he couldnt find a company interested in developing his invention 
more than 20 companies including general electric and rca 
rejected his invention as insignificant 
six years after his discovery he mentioned his invention to dr 
russell w dayton of the battelle memorial institute then a small 
research organization in columbus ohio battelle asked to see the 
process and then agreed to undertake its development 
among those who worked on developing xerography was paul andrus 
who joined battelle in 1947 shortly after graduating from the 
university of wisconsin andrus who still works at battelle went 
on to earn 15 patents in the xerography field 
i can remember the first day i saw the process in a fairly 
crude form and i thought this is really an interesting process a 
person can really get his hands on it and understand the physics of 
it i was impressed andrus said 
but andrus said no one working on xerography had any 
indication that it would become a process of such tremendous 
significance he recalled that his boss speculated battelle might 
someday need one copier to satisfy its needs 
over the years battelles share in xerography profits has 
provided the organization with about 300 million said douglas e 
olesen battelle president and chief executive officer 
it was the major milestone in our history by any measurement 
financial or technical olesen said it did more than anything 
to establish battelle as an organization that could put technology 
to work 
but battelle couldnt develop xerography alone in 1946 
battelle realized it needed additional financing to make carlsons 
invention practical a year later it signed an agreement with a 
small rochester ny company known as haloid co 
battelle and haloid working together unveiled their first 
copier in 1948 but it required 14 complex steps to operate and it 
was not enthusiastically received by businesses still the 
machine known as the oxbox or the model a eventually did fill a 
need in the offset printing business 
encouraged by this limited success battelle and haloid 
continued to work on the machine with haloid eventually assuming 
the bulk of the scientific as well as manufacturing 
responsibilities the first machine was improved again and again 
through subsequent models until 1960 when the 914 was introduced 
following the success of that copier the haloid company 
formally changed its name to the xerox corp it had spent 60 
million and obtained more than 200 patents in advancing xerography 
from carlsons crude invention to a truly automatic machine

general motors corps ambitious egyptian 
compact car project brought in with a bang 2 years ago has crept 
out with a whimper 
while gm says it expects the project to be revived egyptian 
officials appear convinced that the whole idea is a thing of the 
past 
at this point we are waiting for the egyptians to take a step 
to give an indication which way they are about to proceed said 
john pekerek of gms international public relations office in 
detroit 
weve indicated to the government our presence and our 
continuing interest 
egyptian officials on the other hand say theyve heard nothing 
of the project since its kickoff in 1986 
gm announced the project in june of that year for the creation 
of general misr co a joint venture with the governments elnasr 
automotive co 
general misr was to build and market opel corsa compacts and 
midsized opel asconas with production to begin by mid1987 
according to the gm plan additionally the plan envisioned the 
manufacture of auto parts for export to markets in the middle east 
and to opel headquarters in west germany 
the announcement was accompanied by a lavish reception for press 
and officials to celebrate the occasion 
but by may 1987 elnasr automotive had decided with little 
fanfare to pull out the decision followed a setback from there 
detroit for internal gm reasons ezzeldine heikal elnasrs 
president told the associated press 
he refused to elaborate on the setback or the reasons except to 
say that the founderstobe decided the subject was not economic 
we decided to end it it is finished 
as a result egypts compact car industry lost a proposed loan 
from the us agency for international development of 30 million 
to 35 million that had been earmarked for the project 
an american source said since the merger never took off and 
there was no formal request for the loan money never was allocated 
in detroit gm officers acknowledged elnasrs withdrawal and 
say the giant company has found no substitute but they said gm has 
not written off the project and remains optimistic 
the chairman of egypts general authority for investment 
mohieddin ghareeb said his office gave the goahead but he 
understood that problems cropped up between the two parties 
the project ended ghareeb said and since then nobody 
has presented anything to us 
ostensibly a private organization ghareebs agency gives or 
withholds the green light for privatesector projects in 
consultation with a variety of ministries including labor industry 
and agriculture 
its been two years since we talked about the gm opel car 
said yousef mazhar undersecretary of state at the industry 
ministry they gm have not pursued their first interest in 
passenger cars studies they put together showed it would be highly 
priced 
western diplomats agreed that the price issue was at the 
center of the misunderstanding between the two sides but also 
were hopeful for an eventual rebirth of the project 
the two sides have different expectations of what the market 
can handle said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
that deal as originally thought through is not going to work 
for a number of reasons the price issue is at the center of 
it he said 
nevertheless he warned be careful dont write the gm 
project off the gm relationship with egypt is not over 
gm has shared a long past with egypt it began with a busy 
assembly plant in alexandria on the mediterranean coast which was 
nationalized with scores of other industries by the late president 
gamal abdel nasser in 1961 
the american automaking giant made a comeback in the early 
1980s after egypt moved away from nassers socialism to welcome 
private foreign investment again and set up a truck manufacturing 
plant on the outskirts of cairo 
the 1986 announcement of the compactcar project said gm would 
provide 30 percent of the new companys capital the rest was to be 
held by egyptian investors including elnasr wholly owned by the 
government the projects estimated cost was to have been 171 
million 
detroit said the new venture would have complemented general 
motors egypt a jointventure company manufacturing and 
distributing commercial vehicles here since 1984 
initially 52 percent of the components of the compact cars 
would have been made in egypt with plans to increase that 
percentage to 80 percent in 10 years 
mohamed razzaq the pakistaniborn general manager for gm egypt 
refused to discuss the stalemate in the compactcar project or 
answer questions about it 
the demand for cars in egypt totals about 40000 to 60000 a 
year elnasr imports automobile parts mostly from italys fiat 
and combines them with locally made parts to manufacture a 
familysized car and two smaller models

union leaders from ip mills across the country said robert frase 
executive assistant to upiu president wayne glenn in nashville 
tenn 
the company was informed by telegram sunday he said 
international paper had continued to run its mills with 
replacement workers it boasted that production was nearly at 
prestrike levels and insisted the nonunion employees are there 
to stay 
elections are pending to decertify the upiu and the 
international brotherhood of firemen and oilers as bargaining 
agents for mill employees once the strike was a year old only the 
replacement workers were eligible to vote 
a small number of firemen and oilers are included in the 
decision to end the strike 
frase said ending the strike was a strategic move that will 
force ip to rehire strikers when openings occur 
the decision was made by the rank and file by their elected 
leaders he said 
no one twisted their arms or put a gun to their heads frase 
said 
more than 1200 members of the upiu and the ibfo walked out in 
jay in june 1987 in a contract dispute over premium pay for work on 
sundays and holidays and ips demand for looser work rules the 
company has continued to run the mill with nonunion replacement 
workers 
since the walkout began this oncesleepy western maine town has 
seen boisterous rallies and marches and a court order to curb 
namecalling vandalism and occasional violence on the picket lines 
mill spokesman richard white said today that ip intends to keep 
the replacements and said the mill was currently at full 
complement still he acknowledged that strikers will now be 
legally entitled to first preference for any job openings which he 
said occur at average of three per week 
as openings occur we will welcome workers who have been on 
strike who qualify for those openings he said 
the mood was somber this morning at union headquarters where a 
sign out front urged the strikers to stand tall we will all go 
back together inside scores of union members milled about 
its not that we dont want to fight its just that we 
cant we have nothing to fight with said one striker roland 
samson 
felix jacques executive vice president of the local said upiu 
lawyers would explain the implications of the action in detail at a 
union meeting in jay on wednesday night but that essentially it 
would entitle the strikers to any jobs that become available at the 
mill 
by law they cannot hire any permanent replacements as of 
today jacques said 
frase maintained that the walkouts at the jay mill as well as 
at ip mills in depere wis and lock haven pa had successfully 
sent ip and other paper companies the message that such disputes 
are something thats not going to be won easily however he 
refused to concede defeat for the union 
just because the strike is over doesnt mean the conflict has 
ended he said 
the paperworkers union had sought to consolidate the strikes at 
the three mills as well as a lockout at the ip mill in mobile 
ala where todays action by the union has no direct impact

gaming analysts are keeping an eye on golden 
nugget inc chairman steve wynns latest move the purchase of the 
troubled claridge hotel and casino in atlantic city 
wynn announced the purchase last monday saying las vegasbased 
golden nugget will buy the property for 110 million if the sale is 
approved by the hotels management groups and new jersey gaming 
regulators 
the claridge property lost 788 million last year 
daniel lee a gaming industry analyst for drexel burnham lambert 
inc a new yorkbased investment firm said wynn has the potential 
to turn the claridge into one of the more profitable casinos in 
atlantic city 
this is the chance for steve wynn to prove himself as a 
genius lee said he has always talked about the golden 
nuggets marketing now the claridge gives him the perfect place 
to prove himself right 
marvin roffman a gaming analyst with janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia said wynn will offer a challenge to atlantic citys 
11 other resorts 
because the purchase price is relatively low wynns overhead 
will be such that he can offer favorable odds to the gambler 
roffman said 
steve wynn in my opinion is the most creative marketing man 
ive ever seen in the casino business roffman said 
wynn sold his golden nugget hotel and casino in atlantic city to 
bally manufacturing co 20 months ago for 440 million he retained 
25 acres of land in the city for a possible return to gaming in new

club casino in laughlin nev he bought the casino for 40 million 
from del webb the same company that owns the claridge

strip is scheduled to open late next year

is america really in decline economically 
the issue is usually posed as a question because the plain 
truth is that nobody really knows even those who have written 
profound tomes on the subject and by reason of having done so 
claim the designation expert 
the new york times magazine and newsweek in cover stories this 
year asked is america in decline us news amp world report 
phrased it diffently asking are we losing it all major news 
magazines have run similar stories 
while the question is the most pervasive that can be tackled by 
the political candidates they seldom take more than a jab at it 
usually in reference to trade and budget deficits rarely treating 
it as a whole 
scholarly tomes have not been totally convincing and popular 
texts such as that written by ravi batra about the great 
depression supposedly to come in 1990 have been so bludgeoned by 
critics that they their credibility quickly wanes 
nevertheless the doubts generated by the questions and the 
evasions and by the very fact that they are being asked have left 
i iidespread feeling that the great minds of american economics are 
pessimistic about the future 
well not 
fact many highly respected economists believe 
that the entire gloomy thesis has been overstated and seldom 
documented and that popular and academic thinking alike mightb 
caught in a rut 
jfmes griffen economist at aen life amp casualty is one 
edward yardeni of prudentialbache securities is another 
each has been concerned enough to examine the thesis not just by 
the current evidence but through history too each believes that 
analysts are misleading themselves by viewing events through dated 
perspectives 
says griffen though enthusiastically publicized the story is 
now being undercut by events leading to its own decline and 
ultimu demise good riddance 
and yardeni the pessimists do play a very important role in 
our society by identifying the problems but they tend to 
exaggerate the forces of darkness always seem to be superior to 
the forces of light 
the case for american decline is narrowly based says griffen 
who offers this insight into the trade deficit often viewed as 
amexidan weakness 
at its core is a misperception of the implications of 
globalization much lip service is paid these days to the idea of 
one world economy but many commentators then reason within an 
essentially nationalist framework 
in his view critics portray the trade deficit as a case of 
shoddy american goods getting bested in economic competition by the 
higher quality higher value products of rising nations the 
deficit becomes an emblem of decline 
but he says a cooler and more broadly based version of these 
events is that the american deficits of the 1980s provided a 
keynesian fiscal boost to a global economjn danger of pitching 
into the abyss 
far from supporting the case for decline the twin deficits of 
this decade will be seen by future historians as the bold 
initiative of us policy which in the formative years of the 
global economy substantially cuhioned the great depression of the 
1980s 
argues griffen when others shrank from leadership the united 
states accepted a disproportionate share of the burden 
yardenis optimistic view of current events and future 
possibilities is so detailed that it has evolved into an entire 
econlc framework called new wave economics 
new wave economics rejects many of the old businesscycle 
frameworks such as monetarism and supplyside economics as too 
rigid and dogmatic often irrelvant to modern events and 
downright useless at other times 
an example powerful demographic forces related to the aging of 
the baby boom often unexamined by others should push personal 
savings toward 10 percent and the unemployment rate down to 4 
percent within the next five years 
the baby boomers savings will help finance government and 
industry they will help keep interest rates down and as they come 
into their own the baby boomers will become more productive 
rather than a drain on the economy 
in his view capitalism has never been more dynamic and 
eventually wil

trans world airlines inc said monday that most 
holders of twa preferred stock have agreed to give up their voting 
rights clearing another obstacle to chairman carl c icahns plan 
to take the airline private 
twa said it expected the privatization to be completed about 
oct 24 
the airline said around 83 percent of the holders of its 
remaining class of preferred shares who cast ballots consented to 
icahns proposal to eliminate their right to vote in elections of 
twa directors last month the other twa preferred issues were 
converted into 12 percent notes due in 2008 
this was the last major procedural block related to twas 
capital structure that remained in the way of the privatization 
plan said mark buckstein senior vice president and general 
counsel for the airline 
other roadblocks remain however the union representing twa 
flight attendants has asked the department of transportation to 
block the privatization and freeze the airlines assets while it 
investigates icahns fitness to continue managing twa 
the consumer federation of america has filed a similar petition 
and a lawsuit filed by the twa pilots union alleges that icahns 
plan to go private is a breach of the agreements the union made 
with him during his takeover of the carrier 
the battle between icahn and twas unions spilled over into 
congress late last month as lawmakers dueled over whether a house 
subcommittee should scrutinize the dispute 
icahn an aggressive bidder for corporations reportedly has had 
recent discussions with texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
about acquiring ailing eastern airlines from texas air 
the twa chairman who now owns around 77 percent of twas 305 
million common shares outstanding won approval from shareholders 
in early september for his privatization plan 
under the plan icahn and the financial entities controlled by 
him would own about 90 percent of twas stock while the remaining 
shares would be held by an employee stock ownership plan 
airline industry analysts estimate the bid puts a value of 
around 40 a share or 3048 million on the twa shares that icahn 
does not already own 
shareholders not affiliated with icahn would receive for each 
share of common stock 20 in cash and 30 in face amount of the 12 
percent notes due 2008 holders of the remaining class of preferred 
stock would receive 25 cents a share

the securities and exchange commission has 
failed to investigate most reports of suspicious foreign trading of 
us securities despite a growing number of illegal trades 
originating from abroad a house panel said monday 
a report by the government operations committee said the sec had 
actively investigated only 61 of 229 reports from stock exchanges 
of suspicious foreign trades mostly those appearing to involve 
insider trading in 1986 and 1987 
the report was based on a yearlong investigation by the panels 
subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs 
the 168 incidents not investigated by the sec the subcommittee 
said involved 503 foreign individuals banks or other entities in 
25 countries and represented gross potential profits for the 
foreign investors of at least 381 million 
when fraudulent trading from abroad is not comprehensively 
investigated and prosecuted the integrity of us equity markets 
is threatened all investors are put at risk and a tougher standard 
of prosecution for domestic traders is created the house report 
said 
the director of the secs enforcement division gary g lynch 
said monday he had not seen the reports final draft but that in 
testimony before the panel last june the commission had taken issue 
with the way the probe was being conducted 
we at that time pointed out the problems we saw in the 
methodology that they employed lynch said 
he said the house subcommittee investigators had underreported 
the number of sec staffers working on cases involving foreign 
purchases and sales of us securities and that the report was 
based on an incorrect assumption that all trading activity brought 
to the secs attention automatically warranted a federal 
investigation 
lynch said many trades by domestic and foreign investors alike 
are reported to the sec as suspicious because they are 
executed near the time of a major price move on a securties 
exchange most of these trades he said are legitimate 
besides cases of potential insider trading the house report 
said the suspicious trades referred to the sec included 
possible sales of unregistered securities and unspecified other 
acts of market manipulation 
the subcommittee chaired by rep doug barnard dga found 
that the dollar volume of us securities bought and sold by 
foreigners increased from 256 billion in 1977 to 2775 billion 
in 1986 last year it leaped to 4819 billion 
it said expert testimony before the panel last summer indicated 
that the number of illegal trades also had grown in recent years 
although the report gave no figures on this 
foreign transactions accounted for 18 percent of the total 
dollar value of all us equity market transactions last year the 
subcommittee said but they represented more than 30 percent of the 
suspicious trades reported to the sec by stock exchanges 
the report blamed the secs failure to investigate more 
suspicious foreign trades on a shortage of enforcement staff a 
lack of bilateral agreements with other countries to share 
information on securities trades the existence of bank secrecy 
laws in many countries and delays by the stock exchanges in 
reporting suspicious trades to the sec 
in response to the subcommittee investigation the report said 
the sec promised to assign more people to its international 
enforcement activities and give them more responsibility to pursue 
new bilateral informationsharing agreements and to renegotiate and 
expand the scope of existing bilateral agreements 
the house report said these changes would be inadequate to 
correct the enforcement problem 
only six countries switzerland britain japan canada the 
netherlands and italy have bilateral informationsharing 
agreements with the united states the report said and the sec 
rarely pursues suspicious trades originating from other countries 
during 1987 the report said about 141 billion in securities 
transactions in american equity markets originated in foreign 
countries and were not subject to any formal informationsharing 
arrangement with the sec 
the report recommended congress enact legislation prohibiting 
trades in us securities that originate in countries that have 
banking secrecy laws or that refuse to enter into bilateral 
informationsharing agreements on securities matters 
it also recommended congress give the sec more money to step up 
enforcement efforts

soybean futures prices closed higher wheat 
finished lower and corn futures closed mixed monday on the chicago 
board of trade reflecting differing opinions about the size of the 
nations corn and soybean crops 
the agriculture department will release its updated crop 
production estimates wednesday afternoon trading activity ahead of 
the report typically revolves around speculation about the 
government report 
traders generally expect the government to increase its 
production estimates from last months predictions of 147 billion 
bushels of soybeans and 446 billion bushels of corn analysts said 
higher numbers are expected because with the harvest about half 
finished farmers are reporting better yields than most experts had 
projected said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
on monday the respected chicagobased crop analyst conrad 
leslie pegged 1988 us soybean production at 148 billion bushels 
and predicted a corn harvest of 455 billion bushels 
the predictions prompted some buying of soybean futures and 
selling of corn futures lespinasse said but in general he added 
were all just marking time waiting for wednesday 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 427 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 292 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with december at 247 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents higher with november at

first boston corp faced with increasing 
competition from its sister company financiere credit suissefirst 
boston will merge with the londonbased firm in a 11 billion 
deal 
the merger approved by first bostons board and announced on 
sunday follows six months of negotiations 
the new structure will help the two organizations overcome 
strains that have developed in their relationship because of the 
farreaching changes in the global marketplace the firms said in 
a statement 
the combined entity which will be privately held is to be 
called cs first boston inc and headquartered here the merger will 
involve buying out first bostons existing public shareholders at 
5250 a share in cash a total buyout cost of 11 billion 
the swiss banking conglomerate credit suisse will own 445 
percent of the combined new entity giving it effective control and 
the largest foreign stake in a major wall street securities house 
credit suisse will also become the only commercial banking 
concern to control a major securities house banks are prohibited 
in the united states from holding such large stakes in securities 
firms as a provision to separate commercial banking and securities 
underwriting activities 
first boston and credit suisse created financiere credit 
suissefirst boston as a joint venture in 1978 
credit suisse among europes largest banking companies with 
almost 68 billion in assets at the end of last year is able to 
take the stake because it held its interest before the law against 
such holdings took effect staff at the federal reserve approved 
the arrangement last week the new york times reported monday 
the merger of the two firms both among the worlds largest 
providers of financial services is part of a trend toward partial 
foreign ownership of top us investment houses 
peter t buchanan first bostons chief executive said the firm 
is negotiating to bring in other foreign investors to purchase 305 
percent of the new entity 
buchanan indicated that the additional investors would be from 
japan or elsewhere in the pacific basin to give the firm better 
contacts in that market 
until other investors are found the 305 percent stake will be 
bought and held by a friendly investor first boston said 
in an unusual step the firm refused to name the friendly 
investor it said it would be identified before the merger is 
completed 
first boston has suffered several setbacks in the last two 
years including the departure in february of its two best 
dealmakers bruce wasserstein and joseph perella the men left to 
form their own investment bank 
among other troubles the firm had a loss of about 100 million 
in trading risky options on treasury bonds in the summer of 1987 
and had another 50 million loss in trading mortgagebacked 
securities its mortgage securities chief its head of municipal 
finance its head of risk arbitrage seven members of its leveraged 
buyout group and several others either left or were asked to 
leave the wall street journal said 
the merger will shake up senior management credit suisse 
chairman rainer gut 55 who has been outspoken in his displeasure 
with aspects of first bostons performance will become chairman of 
cs first boston upon completion of the transaction 
buchanan will become chief executive of cs first boston but only

not regard the dollars drop as a reliable indicator of its

saudi arabia reaffirmed monday it 
will adhere to an opec oil production quota if other members of the 
cartel do a move clearly aimed at reining in overproduction that 
is driving prices down 
the affirmation was made at the weekly cabinet session chaired 
by king fahd and reported by information minister ali alshaer 
he said saudi arabia affirms anew its keenness to abide by the 
opec quota as soon as other members of the organization adhered to 
their prescribed quotas 
he added that the kingdom also affirmed full consolidation 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries in this 
direction and keenness to preserve cohesion of the organization 
oil industry sources have reported that saudi arabia has 
recently been producing about 6 million barrels of oil a day far 
above its opec quota of 4343 million barrels 
saudi arabia the leading member of the 13nation cartel and the 
worlds largest oil exporter indirectly confirmed these reports 
when it served notice after last weeks cabinet meeting that it 
will not freeze its output while others were violating their quotas 
the sharply worded statement stressed the saudis belief that 
adherence to the opec quota system was the best way to restore 
full stability on the world oil market 
the saudis stiff statements have triggered speculation that 
they might pull out of the cartel it helped found 25 years ago but 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer has denied that 
a glut has pushed down prices by about 6 a barrel from opecs 
benchmark of 18 a barrel in recent weeks to a twoyear low prices 
rose on monday 
industry sources believe that the saudis production increase 
which helped depress prices was primarily aimed at pressuring opec 
members who are overproducing to curb their output before the 
biannual ministerial session nov 21 in vienna the conference 
will review production and pricing problems 
the respected middle east economic survey published in nicosia 
said monday the purpose of saudi arabias upside swing is 
obviously therapeutic that is to say it is designed to hasten a 
return to opec production discipline by advancing the point in time 
when the pain factor will be sufficient to break up the logjam of 
entrenched antagonistic positions among member governments and pave 
the way towards a new agreement 
the weekly newsletter noted that efforts to curb overproduction 
by iran iraq and the united arab emirates were also elements of 
an overall solution 
iran and iraq which badly need oil revenue for postwar 
reconstruction are producing more than their quotas 
iraq which has refused to accept an opec quota of 15 million 
barrels a day is producing an estimated 27 million barrels a day 
and has said it plans to boost that 
it initially demanded parity with iran which has a quota of 
236 million barrels a day but has now made clear it seeks a far 
higher level 
oil sources said that iran hiked production for a test 
period in midseptember to around 29 million barrels a day 
following the gulf war ceasefire aug 20 
but they said irans wardamaged oil industry was clearly not 
able to sustain that production level and has fallen back to a 
daily output of around 24 million to 25 million barrels 
middle east economic survey noted that opecs prices and 
strategy committees will meet oct 20 probably in madrid to 
discuss the crisis 
it noted that a solution will be aided by the fact that the 
time has certainly arrived when volume maximization at the expense 
of price is totally selfdefeating 
the newsletter said that a new opec production agreement hiking 
the ceiling to an overall 19 million barrels a day more than 2 
million barrels above the current limit was likely 
by accommodating members who want higher production without 
cutting other producers output ceilings this would represent a 
cutback of some 2 million barrels a day from current opec output 
which now appears to be running somewhere in the region of 21 
million barrels a day the newsletter said

mci communications corp has agreed to refund 
as much as 33 million to current and former customers who were 
billed for longdistance telephone calls that rang but were 
unanswered 
if approved by a chicago court the agreement will settle 
several classaction lawsuits alleging that mci improperly billed 
customers for longdistance calls that didnt get through 
under the agreement people who were mci customers from 1978 
through 1985 are entitled to a refund or credit of either 21 cents 
for every unanswered call the person can show as having been 
billed or 63 cents for each of the eight years the person was an 
mci customer 
a hearing on approval of the settlement is set for next jan 5 
in cook county circuit court in illinois details of the agreement 
were made public last week 
billing for unanswered calls was a problem for other 
longdistance companies as well us sprint communications co 
settled a similar lawsuit in july 1987 agreeing to pay customers 
as much as 48 million spokesman syd courson said 
the problems date to the early days of longdistance competition 
when new competitors generally got connections with local phone 
companies that were inferior to those used by american telephone amp 
telegraph co 
this unequal access caused a number of problems including 
insufficient and sometimes false electronic signals that determine 
whether a call has been answered some companies considered calls 
that rang more than a certain number of times or for a certain 
length of time to have been answered and the customer was billed 
for the call 
now with about 85 percent of the regional bell phone companies 
lines converted to offer comparable connections to all 
longdistance companies the problem of unanswered calls has been 
nearly eliminated mci said

the cocacola co on monday named ira c herbert 
president of its flagship division cocacola usa in a move aimed 
at increasing its advertising firepower in the cola wars 
herbert executive vice president of the parent company will 
replace edwin r mellett as president of both cocacola usa and the 
companys north america business sector 
mellett a senior vice president of the cocacola co will take 
over the new job of president of international postmix sales 
where he will be in charge of fountain sales outside the united 
states 
we are convinced that the key factor to success in the decade 
ahead will be the ability to serve excite and communicate with the 
consumer in cooperation with our bottlers and the retail trade 
said donald r keough president of the cocacola co 
he called herbert our most experienced and senior marketing 
executive 
pepsico inc cocacolas chief rival in the soft drink market 
has staged splashy advertising campaigns this year linked to the 
americas cup race and heavyweight boxing while cocacolas 
advertising has been more conventional 
emanuel goldman a beverage industry analyst for painewebber in 
san francisco said cocacola has not necessarily been upstaged by 
the pepsi campaigns but he said herberts appointment may indicate 
a concern about marketing among the companys top management 
you cant really be sure but i would say the fact that its 
ike herbert and not somebody else says something goldman said 
herbert worked for the mccannerickson advertising agency before 
joining cocacola in 1965 he later was vice president of marketing 
for cocacola usa and president and chief executive officer of 
cocacola foods he became chief operating officer of the parent 
company in 1982

chicago may be displacing hawaii as the third most popular spot for 
japanese buyers a new study finds 
if purchases continue at the present pace japanese investment 
in us real estate in 1988 should surpass last years record of 
1277 billion according to a study released monday by kenneth 
leventhal amp co a real estate consulting firm 
the companys thirdquarter report which covers only eight 
months because september figures were slow in arriving found 
california attracted the most yen 248 billion worth followed by 
new york state with 15 billion 
illinois climbed to third place with 134 billion in japanese 
purchases primarily of chicago commercial buildings hawaii which 
has consistently placed third in such lists followed illinois with

striking shipyard workers at the electric 
boat division of general dynamics corp prepared monday to vote on 
a tentative 4year contract similar to one rejected two months ago 
by union negotiators 
joseph messier president of the striking metal trades council 
said there were a number of recent developments in the 14week 
strike that put pressure on negotiators to get some 10000 strikers 
back to work 
not only did we have a national labor relations board 
complaint to deal with but we got the boilermakers international 
cutting off their strike benefits and it just caused a big 
problem said messier whose metal trades council is an umbrella 
organization for 10 unions at electric boat 
and people started getting worried about the loss of their 
jobs and some of them being finally unable to cope anymore so we 
were under a lot of pressure to get it settled messier said 
electric boat which builds submarines is a division of st 
louisbased general dynamics a major defense contractor 
due to the columbus day holiday electric boat was closed monday 
and company officials couldnt be reached for comment 
a ratification vote on the proposed contract was to be conducted 
from 6 am to 6 pm tuesday at the groton city municipal 
building and messier said he expected the contract to be approved 
the proposed contract reached saturday evening after four days 
of negotiations in washington dc and connecticut calls for a 3 
percent pay increase and bonuses averaging about 2250 plus 
increased costs to workers for health insurance 
before walking off the job july 1 workers had rejected the idea 
of lumpsum bonuses in lieu of wage increases they had insisted on 
a 3year contract with a 5 percent raise in the first year and 4 
percent raises in each of the next two years

which competitors hadnt been able to duplicate if hamilton were 
to disclose what he knew to minute maid it would cause lasting 
and irreparable harm to tropicana the company said in its court 
filings

dislike of tropicana and stated he would get the company

injunction in late march

proprietary information was against company policy

1982 to march 4 was involved in secret processes that enable 
tropicana to produce its pure premium brand orange juice 
in early 1988 tropicana became aware of industry reports that 
cokes minute maid division intended to produce a pasteurized 
orange juice to compete with pure premium 
tropicana has devoted 40 years to producing the highest 
quality product available anywhere not just in orange juice but in 
all its juice beverages said brent gabler vice president of 
manufacturing for tropicana 
we simply could not stand by and allow the results of 40 years 
of work to suddenly reach the hands of our competition we are very 
grateful that the florida legislature is aware of the needs of 
companies which have developed sophisticated processes to protect 
their trade secrets gabler said

publisher malcolm stevenson forbes as 
usual made forbes magazines list of the 400 richest people in 
america and as usual he chose not to disclose his own wealth 
forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret and 
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know 
where he falls on the list 
saying no official wealth estimate is available the magazine 
has made him no 113 on the list between laszlo nandor tauber 
worth 500 million and john thomas lupton worth 480 million 
but really how much is he worth 
one thing i can say for sure hes definitely worth between 
225 million and 6 billion said harold seneker a forbes editor 
being publisher has its privileges for the far hills 
millionorbillionaire in short he doesnt publish how much hes 
worth because he doesnt have to 
there is no dollar figure for him simply because he feels 
its his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his 
net worth said forbes spokesman ray healey he just chooses to 
keep it to himself 
but really how much is he worth 
i dont think he even knows what it is and i dont think hes 
in any hurry to have it figured out said don garson director of 
corporate communications for forbes 
it would be unfair to forbes to print his worth garson said 
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are 
presumed estimated and forbes would be presumed factual since it 
is his magazine 
while the oct 24 issue includes outsiders estimates of forbes 
worth they range dramatically the london daily mail guesses 400 
million newsday estimates his worth between 400 million and 700 
million and new yorks daily news simply says hes a 
billionaire 
in addition to forbes magazine which his father launched in 
1917 forbes 69 owns american heritage magazine somerset press 
a 400squaremile colorado ranch a south sea island a london 
mansion and a french chateau among other holdings
