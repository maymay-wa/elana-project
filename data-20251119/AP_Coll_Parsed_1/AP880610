the editor of a leading african magazine 
has publicly apologized to kenyan moslems for an article alleging 
arabs introduced homosexuality together with the islamic faith to 
kenya 
it has been pointed out to the publishers of the magazine that

way linked to islam benjamin g bundeh said in a statement 
published in nairobi newspapers thursday 
the article which appeared in junes issue of the monthly true 
love magazine alleged that homosexuality is widely practiced for 
money at the indian ocean port of mombasa and other resort towns 
along the coast 
moslem leaders and politicians in mombasa reacted angrily to the 
report as soon as the magazine hit the newsstands on june 2 
such reports are malicious and calculated to create disunity 
and hatred between christians and moslems in the country said

a veteran agriculture department narcotics 
expert says he was forced out of his job because he declined to 
recommend use of a powerful herbicide on cocaineproducing areas in 
south america 
walter gentner 66 former national technical advisor on 
narcotics said thursday he refused to be pressured into 
recommending use of the herbicide spike because of concerns 
over its potential environmental impact 
eli lilly amp co based in indianapolis touched off a 
controversy two weeks ago when it decided not to sell spike known 
formally as tebuthiuron to the us government for use in an 
anticocaine campaign in peru and other andean countries 
the state department said last week the safety and 
effectiveness of spike has been confirmed and that the shortterm 
impact of lillys decision will be serious 
but gentner defended lillys position in a telephone interview 
thursday saying we need the facts before we go and do something 
irreversible 
gentners former boss thomas army deputy administrator of the 
agricultural research service could not be reached for comment 
thursday but he told the washington times that gentner wasnt 
aggressive enough in the war on drugs 
you got to get after it with a sense of urgency army was 
quoted as saying 
gentner who said he visited 43 countries on drug control 
assignments during his long government career decided to retire 
rather than accept a demotion 
he said spike is manufactured in the form of pellets and is 
ideal for use along railroads and highways 
but he said the herbicide might not be safe if it is applied to 
wet soils which are later drenched by heavy rains in that case 
the pellets could roll downhill and affect plants outside the 
target zone he said adding that coca plant growing areas in the 
andes often have an inch of rain a day 
expressing sympathy for lillys position gentner said a 
cocaeradication campaign in south america would represent only a 
small part of the companys overall operation 
but if the herbicide proved to be ecologically damaging lilly 
could be faced with a wave of liability suits which would give the 
product a black mark affecting its marketability in the united 
states and elsewhere he said 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the herbicide 
is widely used in the united states and brazil and noted that lilly 
stands by the safety of its product 
but lilly spokesman ted mckinney said the herbicide is safe only 
when used according to labeled directions for approved purposes 
lilly has not tested tebuthiuron for use in controlling coca 
nor has the company tested tebuthiuron under the actual conditions 
found in peru he said 
the washington times reported in thursdays editions that an epa 
report concluded that the toxic effect of spike and two other 
products under consideration in the antidrug war have not been 
fully evaluated

a new reagan administration report urges state 
and local governments to do more to provide outdoor recreation a 
recommendation that a democratic lawmaker quickly criticized as 
reflecting the administrations policy of no spending for 
parkland or facilities 
the report thursday by the task force on outdoor recreation 
resources and opportunities also suggests that higher fees be 
charged to cover the cost of operating and maintaining recreation 
facilities in the national parks 
but the report stops short of endorsing recommendations made 
more than a year ago by a presidential commission to establish a 
trust fund of recreation money to aid states and communities and to 
create a network of greenways to tie together existing and new 
trails waterways and bike paths 
rep bruce vento dminn who heads the house interior 
subcommittee on national parks and recreation contended that the 
new report just reflects the administrations policy of no 
spending for parkland or facilities 
the report he said is an example of this administration not 
taking care to pass on these resources to future generations 
vento said that he believes the task force was appointed to do 
damage control to push the commissions report under the rug the 
administration doesnt want new trust funds or to buy new land but 
the truth is that congress is moving forward on both 
paul pritchard president of the national parks and conservation 
association also faulted the new report maintaining that it 
does nothing but blur the original version pritchard said he 
served as an adviser to the presidents commission on americans 
outdoors commission that produced the original report 
he said his group opposes any additional fee increases at 
national parks butanything further would be totally punitive on 
the poor and the elderly 
the national park service imposed entrance fees at 73 parks 
monuments and other installations for the first time and raised 
entrance fees at 61 other sites in february 1987 but it is 
generally acknowledged that those fees fall short of what is needed 
to cover maintenance and operations at the parks 
the task force report says the new or higher fees do not appear 
to have kept people away from national parks and adds there are 
indications that people are seeking more comfortable and convenient 
facilities and a higher quality of services than in decades past 
and are more willing to pay for them 
in a statement issued thursday interior secretary donald hodel 
praised the task forces report and called it a blueprint for 
future development of americas great outdoor recreation potential 
in ways that will truly benefit all americans 
hodel said he was especially pleased that the new report 
emphasized community action as the basis from which outdoor 
recreation needs are determined and met 
jacqueline e schafer a member of the presidential council on 
environmental quality said in introducing the new report that it 
already has been sent to the cabinet for implementation by federal 
departments and agencies 
she said the task force had focused on a finding in the original 
report that americans were looking for outdoor recreation 
opportunities close to home therefore she said the task 
force recommended that the federal government encourage all of 
americas communities to make the most of their own recreation 
resources and potential 
the report also emphasizes the role of private business in 
developing recreation facilities on national parkland and on 
reservoirs maintained by the army corps of engineers and it points 
to efforts by private industry to open up land to the public 
citing numerous instances of power companies providing land for 
public fishing hiking and boating

congress has approved and sent to the white 
house legislation to ban most uses by private employers of lie 
detectors described by one senator as inaccurate instruments of 
intimidation 
the senate voted 6824 on thursday to approve a compromise 
version of a housepassed bill that would prohibit most polygraph 
tests labor secretary ann dore mclaughlin has said she will ask 
president reagan to sign the bill 
the final version of the legislation approved by housesenate 
negotiators last month would prohibit most private sector 
employers from requiring their workers or job applicants to take 
lie detector tests exceptions would be made for drug companies and 
those providing security services 
the bill would prohibit an employee from being discharged 
dismissed disciplined discriminated against or denied employment 
or promotion solely on the basis of the test or solely because of 
refusal to take the test to take action against the worker an 
employer would have to have additional supporting evidence 
the congressional office of technology assessment estimated that 
2 million polygraph tests were administered in 1987 with 90 
percent given by private employers most of those were job 
applicants although they also were given to workers under 
investigation 
the accuracy of test results has been questioned and so has the 
competency of some examiners 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
committee called the legislation long overdue 
for too long we have known the widespread and growing use of 
these socalled liedetectors was subject to misuse and abuse he 
said before the senate voted for too long we have allowed 
millions of employees and job applicants to be strapped to these 
inaccurate instruments of intimidation 
judy goldberg of the american civil liberties union said the law 
will affect 28 states which have no regulation of polygraph 
examinations or only regulate the examiners 
states with no regulation of examinations include colorado 
indiana kansas missouri new hampshire new york north dakota 
ohio and wyoming 
states regulating polygraph examiners only include alabama 
arizona arkansas florida georgia illinois kentucky louisiana 
mississippi nevada new mexico north carolina oklahoma south

the federal aviation administration and the 
coast guard would both receive large increases in their budgets 
under the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations bill approved 
by a house committee 
the bill also would continue federal support for amtrak the 
passenger rail line against the reagan administrations wishes 
the bill was sent to the full house on thursday by a voice vote 
of the appropriations committee it would provide 109 billion for 
the governments transportation programs in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
the legislation also would give the government authority to 
spend an additional 169 billion from special accounts set aside 
for various aviation highway and mass transit programs 
it gives the coast guard a budget of nearly 31 billion and 
directs that at least 492 million of that amount be used for drug 
interdiction programs faa spending would grow to nearly 67 
billion with enough money to increase the number of air traffic 
controllers from 16020 to 16800 by sept 30 1989 
both amounts are increases of about 16 percent over spending 
levels this year 
the appropriations bill would provide 33 billion for mass 
transit 18 billion more than proposed by the reagan 
administration and 594 million for amtrak the administration had 
sought to end all federal assistance to the passenger railroad 
which expects to carry 34 million passengers next year 
another provision of the bill would threaten the coffers of 
bostons logan international airport if it pursues plans to reduce 
congestion by raising landing fees for small planes 
logan officials plan to increase charges for small aircraft on 
july 1 in an effort to reduce the number of private planes landing 
there and thus ease delays for commercial airliners 
groups representing private aircraft owners have filed federal 
suits aimed at blocking the plan claiming the fees discriminate 
against small plane owners 
in addition the transportation department has opened an 
investigation of the program and asked logan officials to delay 
implementing the new fees until the inquiry is complete probably 
in november airport officials have refused 
an amendment to the appropriations bill introduced by rep 
silvio conte rmass and adopted by a 1915 vote would withhold 
federal assistance to logan unless the courts and the 
transportation department decide that the new fee structure is 
legal 
logan spokesman tom champion said the measure would affect 112 
million in federal money to be used mostly for noise reduction and 
runway improvement the loss of the aid would have little effect on 
the airports operations he said

a new strain of virus isolated from an african 
blood sample by a california research team attacks with a lethal 
aidslike infection that scientists say cannot yet be explained 
according to a report published friday 
jay a levy leader of the university of california at san 
francisco team that conducted the study said the new isolated 
virus strain is able to cause a fatal infection but does so without 
killing cells in the human body 
this suggests said levy that the lethal mechanism of the virus 
is different from the aids virus that is infecting and killing 
americans 
still another new virus strain from the family that causes 
aidslike disease in africa has been isolated by a team at the 
university of alabama birmingham this new strain appears to be 
less virulent than aids viruses identified earlier said george m 
shaw leader of the alabama research group 
both studies of the new virus strains are reported in fridays 
issue of the journal science 
the new isolates found by the researchers are both strains of 
human immunodeficiency virus two or hiv2 this virus is a subtype 
of the hiv1 that is blamed for the aids epidemic in the united 
states 
both hiv1 and hiv2 have been found in aids patients in africa 
but only one patient has been found in the united states to be 
infected with hiv2 that patient who died in this country is 
believed to have been infected in africa 
levy said his group isolated its strain of hiv2 from a blood 
sample taken from a native of mali who was hospitalized in ivory 
coast a west african nation he said the patient suffered from 
chronic diarrhea and weight loss and died last fall from neurologic 
complications all symptoms seen in aids patients 
but levy said the researchers are unable to say how the virus 
caused these disease symptoms 
in laboratory studies of us aids cases the hiv1 virus has 
been found to infect cells in the blood brain bowel and bone 
marrow and to kill cells in the immune system levy said that 
while the new strain of hiv2 will infect a variety of cells in 
laboratory tests it will not kill the cells 
it doesnt have to kill cells to cause disease he said 
he suggested that the new strain may infect cells of the brain and 
bowel and paralyze the cellular function or force the cells to 
make products that are toxic to the body 
the key here is that maybe all hiv viruses do this levy 
said maybe killing cells is something we see in the laboratory 
but it is not a major aspect in disease induction in a person that 
is where were looking now 
shaw said the hiv2 strain found by his group was isolated from a 
blood sample taken from a healthy prostitute in senegal west 
africa 
shaw said his team now is looking at the genetic differences 
that cause one type of hiv virus to kill infected cells while 
another strain does not 
this will provide an important scientific tool to study the 
cellular and biological basis for cellkilling disease he 
said all of this can be combined to better understand the 
biology of the hiv family of viruses 
levy said there are many strains of hiv viruses and scientists 
will need to understand their diversity and commonality to develop 
an antiviral medication that will work against all types of aids 
infections 
howard streicher one of the leading aids researchers at the 
national institutes of health said isolation of the two strains of 
hiv2 virus gives an important advance in the war against the killer 
disease 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been shown 
among us patients to kill by destroying the bodys immune system 
this leaves the patient susceptible to fatal opportunistic diseases 
and infections 
aids is spread mostly through homosexual contact and from 
needles shared by drug abusers it also can be spread through 
infected blood transfusions and from a birthing mother to her child 
according to figures released monday by the centers for disease 
control aids has been diagnosed in 64506 americans of whom more 
than half or 36255 have died no one is known to have recovered 
from aids

michael dukakis plans a positive fall campaign 
touting his own record as massachusetts governor while questioning 
whether george bush has any real accomplishments of his own 
at the same time aides say dukakis is prepared to fend off 
attacks from bush on foreign policy issues by reminding voters of 
bushs ties to controversial reagan administration actions 
including the irancontra affair 
dukakis who clinched the democratic nomination with a sweep of 
the final four primaries tuesday says he is eager to debate the 
republican nomineetobe 
dukakis will promote his management of the booming massachusetts 
economy and support of universal health care he also will point to 
the reagan administrations failure to promote affordablehousing 
programs and to the presidents veto of a trade bill that required 
advance notice of plant closings dukakis aides say 
on the international front bush has tried to depict dukakis as 
a novice whose views pose a threat to national security aides say 
dukakis will try to keep pressure on bush by criticizing reagans 
policies in central america dukakis also will continue to demand 
that bush fully disclose his roles in the irancontra affair and 
administration dealings with panamanian strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega aides say 
campaign aides are working on speeches and ads that list 
dukakis major campaign themes competent management and new 
leadership for the 1990s while seeking to portray bush as a 
career politician without a true legacy 
if were talking about our record it will remind people that 
he doesnt have one dukakis campaign spokesman leslie dach said 
in an interview he suggested that dukakis will avoid direct 
attacks on bush but force voters to question the vice presidents 
positions 
if we talk about the tough stands dukakis has taken it will 
remind people that bush hasnt taken any positions dach said 
vital to any dukakis fall strategy is a relatively smooth 
resolution of differences with jesse jackson and adoption of a 
strong but general platform that does not create the appearance 
that dukakis is beholden to special interests the dukakis camp 
said 
planning for the fall campaign is still in the early stages but 
dach said dukakis may use an approach used by kansas sen bob dole 
who sought the gop nomination the dole campaign came up with an ad 
that showed a man walking across a field of snow but leaving no 
footprints 
in speeches dole questioned the vice presidents record saying 
bush had an impressive resume but few actual accomplishments 
some dukakis aides already have adopted doles message in their 
rhetoric 
he cant tell us or wont tell us what his role in this 
administration has been said dukakis issues adviser christopher 
edley a former carter white house aide he doesnt seem to leave 
any footprints 
dukakis also plans to counter bushs effort to portray the 
massachusetts governor as a member of the liberal elite by 
pointing to bushs privileged background dukakis is the son of 
greek immigrants 
i think it is very important to the american people that the 
next president be someone who understands their problems and their 
concerns said dukakis campaign manager susan estrich 
while the dukakis camp is uneasy over the prospect of convention 
fights with rival democrat jackson most dukakis aides concede 
those battles should help dispel bushs characterization of dukakis 
as an ultraliberal in the mold of jimmy carter or george mcgovern 
bushs strategy seems to be to go out and attack somebody who 
isnt even in the race said edley 
one issue that could put dukakis on the defensive is taxes 
dukakis has refused to rule out new federal taxes as a means of 
reducing the federal deficit while bush has ruled out a tax hike 
dukakis also will have to sign a new state budget that includes 
some tax increases 
recent national polls have suggested dukakis has a doubledigit 
lead over bush but dukakis aides believe the race will tighten now 
that the primaries are over and voters can focus on the nominees 
dukakis plans to campaign hard during the summer 
were not going to make the mistake of underestimating george 
bush or the republicans estrich said theyve got some very 
talented people and they are going to have a lot of resources

a house chairman is urging the nuclear 
regulatory commission and the justice department to develop a 
systematic way of handling atomic industry cases under 
investigation by both agencies 
the nrcs lack of cooperation combined with bureaucratic 
petulance could have damaged a potential justice department case 
involving steven a white director of the tennessee valley 
authoritys nuclear power program said rep sam gejdenson 
chairman of the house interior subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations 
the connecticut democrat said thursday that the nrc took 
offense when the justice department did not object to a house 
subcommittee request for commission officials to answer questions 
about the white case at an april hearing 
the nrc decided to go ahead with its own civil enforcement 
proceedings irrespective of how this could affect a criminal 
prosecution of the case by the justice department gejdenson 
said he called the nrcs action apparent retaliation for the 
departments cooperation with congress 
this reflects a lack of regard by the nrc both for the process 
of congressional oversight and for the governments pursuit of 
wrongdoing in the courts gejdenson said in a letter to nrc 
chairman lando w zech jr 
a new policy spelling out procedures for investigations 
involving the two agencies needs to be explicit and it must place 
the need for tough enforcement over bureaucratic petulance 
gejdenson said the two agencies have been negotiating for several 
years to create an investigations policy said gejdenson aide john 
scheibel 
nrc spokesman robert newlin said agency officials would not 
comment because they had not seen the congressmans letter 
gejdenson also released an exchange of letters between zech and 
the justice department regarding the white case 
deputy assistant attorney general victoria toensing wrote to 
zech that the only reason the justice department did not object to 
the april hearing was that the nrc had given to other congressional 
committees substantially all of the investigative materials in 
the white matter that had been provided to the department for 
review for possible criminal prosecution 
knowing of such wholesale public dissemination of these 
investigative materials we believed that it would be an empty 
gesture to object to the april 21 hearing she wrote 
zech in an earlier letter to the justice department said he 
was going ahead with consideration of civil enforcement proceedings 
in view of the departments lack of objection to a full public 
discussion of the case 
white has been under investigation by the nrc for allegedly 
misrepresenting safety conditions at tvas watts bar plant in 
spring city tenn 
the nrcs top investigator told congress in april that white 
deliberately misled the agency in a march 1986 letter in which he 
assured regulators that there were no pervasive quality 
assurance problems at the stillunlicensed reactor an nrc review 
group disagreed no nrc action has been taken 
white has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and tva chairman 
marvin runyon has defended the program manager 
the nrc referred the case to the justice department last year

abortion foes are claiming victory from a 
house committee vote to exempt abortioninducing drugs and 
contraceptive devices from a proposed shield against punitive 
damages in liability lawsuits 
the proposal was tacked onto a controversial product liability 
bill by the house energy and commerce committee on a 2119 vote 
thursday shortly after the panel had rejected a much broader 
antiabortion amendment 
the amendment sponsored by rep thomas j tauke riowa would 
deny manufacturers of abortioncausing drugs and devices the same 
protection against punitive damages that the bill would extend to 
other drugs approved by the food and drug administration 
the tauke amendment would affect oral contraceptives 
intrauterine devices and new experimental abortion pills now 
marketed in several foreign countries it would not cover such 
contraceptive barriers as condoms spermicides or cervical caps 
douglas johnson legislative director of the national right to 
life committee hailed the committees approval of the tauke 
amendment as the most important prolife victory in congress in 
the past two years 
johnson said the vote sends a crystalclear message to the 
pharmaceutical industry that developing and marketing 
abortioncausing drugs will be a risky and unprofitable business 
because congress wont shield them from liability suits 
but bill hamilton chief lobbyist for planned parenthood inc 
predicted the antiabortion provision will be stripped from the 
bill by the house judiciary committee which will consider the 
measure next if the energy and commerce committee approves it 
in any case hamilton said the bill has no chance of passing 
congress in this election year an assessment shared by rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce panel 
approval of the tauke amendment came as dingells committee 
neared the end of drafting the compromise bill which is intended 
to preempt conflicting state liability standards with a uniform 
but limited set of federal standards opposed by consumer groups 
proconsumer lobbyists say the measure will make it harder for 
victims of unsafe products to recover damages from manufacturers 
business supporters of the bill say it will help ease the costly 
burden of liability suits and make american products more 
competitive on foreign trade markets 
hamilton scoffed at johnsons claim that the tauke amendment 
effectively places abortioninducing drugs and devices in the same 
category with alcohol tobacco and asbestos as dangerous products 
under the bill 
we think its outrageous hamilton said basically 
contraceptives are a great deal safer than many other products 
protected by that legislation safer than penicillin safer even 
than driving a car 
the tauke amendment eagerly sought by antiabortion lobbyists 
would cover any drug or device that interferes with the implanting 
of a human embryo in the uterus or subsequently aborts a pregnancy 
the committee rejected on a 2121 tie vote a broader proposal by 
rep gerry sikorski dminn that would have exempted all drugs 
that might cause abortions or threaten a man or womans ability to 
produce children 
dingell who opposed both amendments protested that sikorskis 
proposal would unfairly penalize such necessary products as 
aspirin heating pads eye drops and drugs necessary for treating 
cancer and the aids virus 
rep henry waxman dcalif said the real purpose of taukes 
amendment was to drive contraceptive manufacturers out of 
business he and dingell noted that such drugs must pass fda 
clearance procedures that are far stricter than those required for 
other drugs

justice ended its public hearings i am personally relieved and 
prepared to go forward if articles of impeachment are approved 
against me 
the subcommittee will make a recommendation to the full house 
judiciary committee on whether hastings who still sits on the 
federal bench should be impeached if hastings is impeached by the 
house the senate will conduct a trial to determine whether he 
should be removed from office 
it will be a donnybrook of a trial hastings said when 
the dust settles ill be standing 
he said his best estimate is that the subcommittee will vote 71 
against recommending that he be impeached with rep patrick l 
swindall rga probably casting the only negative vote against 
him 
he said however that the vote may go against me because 
were in a political situation here 
chairman john conyers dmich said the panels record would 
remain open for another week for additional comments by hastings 
attorneys conyers declined to predict when the subcommittee would 
act saying it depended on what hastings lawyers submitted 
conyers ended the public hearings after permitting hastings to 
call two witnesses against allegations he conspired to take a bribe 
in exchange for modifying the sentences of two racketeers hastings 
had requested that the panel hear more than 100 witnesses 
florreyn joyette joy royals a member of the metro miami 
action plan a civil rights organization contradicted testimony 
from dade county mayor steve clark that hastings gave him 
information which fbi agents have said caused them to stop three 
major investigations because a wiretap had been compromised 
clark testified before the subcommittee that he talked to 
hastings after a speech on sept 6 1985 and the judge told him to 
stay away from kevin waxy gordon against whom hastings had 
approved an fbi wiretap gordon was the target of an fbi corruption 
investigation 
miss royals told the subcommittee that hastings left the hotel 
ballroom as soon as he completed making his speech and did not talk 
to the mayor 
the rev bryan o walsh a catholic priest in the miami diocese 
testified that he talked briefly with hastings and clark together 
before the breakfast meeting 
hastings declined to testify before the subcommittee 
in addition to the charge that he compromised the three 
investigations by leaking the fact that the fbi had a wiretap 
hastings also is accused of conspiring with washington lawyer 
william borders to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the 
sentences of two convicted racketeers 
borders convicted in 1982 of arranging a 150000 bribe for 
hastings was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 35000

this years estimated winter wheat harvest 
will be down 3 percent from last months forecast because of 
drought and disease agriculture department economists say 
inadequate moisture and disease plagued winter wheat in the 
central and northern great plains during may the departments 
agricultural statistics board said in its report released thursday 
it estimated winter wheat production at 157 billion bushels 
slightly more than last year but still 3 percent below mays 
forecast of 162 billion bushels last years output was 156 
billion bushels 
satellite photos reportedly show disease is taking a toll on 
soft red winter wheat in kansas and some usda officials think that 
drought could worsen the situation but they say a healthy rainfall 
could ease the problem considerably over much of the country 
the report put this years average yield at 394 bushels an 
acre down 04 bushels from the 1987 level and 13 bushels an acre 
below the may estimate 
the report said crop conditions vary through most of the country 
but are mostly fair to good except in the plains where they are 
fair 
development of the crop was average or better except in the 
pacific northwest and colorado it said it said the wheat was 
turning color in illinois kansas and missouri and that the harvest 
had moved into oklahoma and expanded across the delta and southeast 
harvested acres are expected to be 398 million acres this year 
the same same estimate that the department issued last month and 1 
percent above the level for last season 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
summer it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production 
the report did not include 1988 production estimates for spring 
wheat corn and other springplanted crops the department will 
make those forecasts later in the growing season 
a separate supply and demand report from the economic research 
service said that flour and related food production would be lower 
by perhaps 35 million bushels and the reduction should offset 
somewhat the reduced supply of winter wheat thus it projected only 
a slight reduction in the nations wheat stockpile 
the kansas winter wheat crop as usual the largest by far was 
estimated at 329 million bushels down from 3663 million in 1987 
the yield was put at 35 bushels per acre compared with 37 bushels 
last year the states farmers also trimmed their acreage to 94 
million acres from 99 million in 1987 
indicated production of winter wheat and average yields in 1988 
by major producing states based on june 1 prospects included 
arkansas 41800000 bushels and an average yield of 44 bushels 
per acre california 35640000 and 81 colorado 86950000 and 
37 georgia 19780000 and 43 idaho 56880000 and 72 illinois 
61600000 and 55 indiana 34300000 and 49 kansas 329000000 
and 35 kentucky 15990000 and 41 michigan 29140000 and 47 
missouri 65800000 and 47 montana 52800000 and 24 nebraska 
86100000 and 42 north carolina 18900000 and 42 ohio 
49920000 and 48 oklahoma 176400000 and 36 oregon 42900000 
and 66 south dakota 46500000 and 30 tennessee 14820000 and

agriculture department economists are 
estimating soviet wheat imports for 198788 at 215 million tons 
down 500000 from last months forecast but still the second 
highest on record 
the department said thursday that the pace of that nations 
imports has slowed in recent weeks possibly a reaction to higher 
wheat prices combined with the healthy outlook for the estimated 92 
millionton soviet crop 
the united states with wheat sales of over 12 million tons thus 
far this year will account for more than 50 percent of the soviet 
market for foreign wheat followed by canada and the european 
community the report said 
it said the united states also is expected to be the largest 
supplier of coarse grains to the soviets with 40 percent of this 
years market nearly threefourths of the imports are expected to 
be corn 
most of the remainder will be barley primarily from canada and 
western europe the report said

it takes more than presidents and painters to 
keep the white house going 
it also takes five calligraphers one accountant four florists 
two shifts of electricians and 39 domestic employees who serve 
meals greet visitors and keep house 
the 57 million budget for the executive residence is now 
working its way through congress and details are disclosed in 
hearing records published by the house appropriations committee 
they show a staff of 94 people working in a 132room rabbit 
warren of a building with floors badly damaged by 37 million people 
who have walked on them 
they also show that in the white house as in many other houses 
things tend to accumulate and not get disposed of 
manus j fish jr director of the national capital region of 
the national park service outlined the budget before the 
appropriations subcommittee on the treasury postal service and 
general government appropriations 
the budget request covers fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 it 
is down 17 million from the amount appropriated for this fiscal 
year 
that amount however included 24 million for a major project 
to remove between 30 and 50 layers of paint from the pennsylvania 
avenue side of the building and repaint it 
after you subtract this amount the new budget request is a 13 
percent increase 
a major share of the increase is requested to replace floors in 
the state dining room and a private dining room next to it 
an estimated 37 million visitors had walked on the floors 
since they were installed during the 19481952 renovation fish 
told the subcommittee 
he brought along a piece of the floor which had been removed to 
show how it had been worn almost to nothing at one end 
high heels that type of thing you can see cause some 
indentations in the wood he told the lawmakers 
fish said the park service is asking for 65000 to make the 
position of curator fulltime bringing the fulltime staff to 94 
the curator was a parttime job shared with the state department 
until recently the present curator rex scouten works full time 
but is paid by the white house historical association under a 
temporary arrangement 
the curators job is defined as to assure proper preservation 
of artifacts and objects of each presidency there are plenty to 
preserve 
fish told the subcommittee that the white house inventory fills 
1100 pages it is also computerized and contains information on 
more than 50000 museum objects and utilitarian objects that 
belong to the executive mansion 
many of them are in a warehouse after the election the new 
president and his wife will probably go to the warehouse and pick 
out the items they want in their new home fish said 
fish said 50000 is requested for refurbishing the mansion for 
the new family 
when asked by rep joe skeen rnm whether the park service 
ever decides it can get rid of some of the material fish said 
we do a onceayear review but there arent too many items 
fish outlined the staff as follows 
a staff of 39 domestic employees accomplishes general 
housekeeping prepares and serves meals greets visitors and 
provides services as required in support of official ceremonies and 
functions a staff of 33 tradespersons including plumbers 
carpenters painters on a single shift electricians on a double 
shift and operating engineers on a 24hour basis maintains and 
makes repairs minor modifications and improvements to the 132 
rooms and the mechanical systems and provides support for official 
and ceremonial functions 
a staff of 14 specialized employes includes four florists 
five curators and five calligraphers 
there is also an administrative staff consisting of the chief 
usher three assistant ushers an executive grounds superintendent 
two administrative assistants and one accountant 
elaine crispen press secretary to first lady nancy reagan said 
the 132 rooms include service rooms many of them in two 
subbasements in addition to the family quarters and the two 
floors that are open to public tours

the government would have more muscle when it 
seeks penalties against railroad workers who commit safety 
violations under legislation on its way to the white house for 
president reagans signature 
the senate passed the measure on a voice vote thursday giving 
final congressional approval to legislation sparked by a railroad 
disaster that occurred 17 months ago 
the legislation was developed after 16 people were killed and 
175 hurt jan 4 1987 when three connected conrail locomotives 
passed a stop signal and collided with an amtrak passenger train in 
chase md 
the measure approved thursday and having the support of 
administration officials would make it illegal for train workers 
to tamper with safety devices the conrail crew was found to have 
placed tape over a device that whistles if a train passes a stop 
signal 
the bill also would increase federal civil penalties levied for 
safety violations the maximum fine would increase from 2500 to 
20000 
under the measure the government would acquire the right to 
penalize individual workers for safety violations currently 
federal authorities only have the power to penalize railroad 
companies if rules are broken 
the power to pursue civil penalties would be in addition to the 
right the government already has to seek criminal charges 
the bill does not address another concern that arose from the 
chase md accident drug use by railroad workers members of the 
conrail crew have admitted they were smoking marijuana shortly 
before the crash 
separate legislation that would require random drug and alcohol 
testing of more than 3 million transportation workers has passed 
the senate but remains at committee level in the house 
in addition to toughening penalties the bill awaiting president 
reagans signature gives the department of transportation a year to 
create a licensing system for engineers including requirements for 
training and knowledge of operating practices 
the government also would be empowered to examine applicants 
automobile driving licenses in an effort to learn if they have drug 
or alcohol convictions 
in addition the measure requires installation within three 
years of black boxes that would record a trains operating data 
in case of an accident 
the legislation was written largely by sens frank lautenberg 
dnj john danforth rmo and j james exon dneb 
the bill passed the house may 23 by a voice vote

fired national security council aide oliver l 
north is first on the prosecutions lineup of defendants to be 
tried individually in four separate irancontra conspiracy trials 
ordered by the judge in the case 
but independent counsel lawrence e walsh is trying to minimize 
the tactical setback imposed by us district judge gerhard a 
gesells decision to hold separate trials of north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and richard v secord 
walsh on thursday proposed trying north and his former boss 
poindexter simultaneously before two juries and then holding a 
similar proceeding for hakim and secord former business partners 
who brokered the usiran arms deals and the diversion of profits 
to the nicaraguan rebels 
gesell said four separate trials are needed to allow the 
defendants to use each others immunized congressional testimony to 
defend the charges a joint trial would compromise an individual 
defendants right not to have what he told congress last year used 
against him as evidence the judge said 
all the defendants except secord received limited immunity from 
prosecution for their testimony before last years congressional 
hearings the law bars walsh from using a defendants immunized 
congressional testimony against him 
but walsh said conducting two dualjury trials would meet the 
courts interest in protecting the rights of the defendants while 
alleviating the enormous burdens on the government of trying each 
defendant sequentially 
one jury would leave the courtroom when information prejudicial 
to the defendant whose case it was hearing was introduced in court 
four separate and sequential trials will result in at least 
some of the defendants living under the cloud of an indictment for 
several months walsh said in a court filing thursday 
legal experts say it would also force walsh to disclose the 
heart of his case to the other defendants long before they go to 
trial trying each defendant separately could also have the effect 
of diluting evidence that they participated in a conspiracy 
according to former federal prosecutors 
walsh said it was logical to try north and poindexter together 
because they were both charged with using their positions of 
trust and power to facilitate and protect an illegal financial and 
logistical network set up to help the nicaraguan rebels after 
congress banned us military aid to the contras 
both are accused of numerous acts of obstruction and false 
statements intended to cover up the activities of the 
enterprise walsh said 
although evidence against the defendants would overlap two 
dualjury trials would offer clear advantages in terms of 
judicial efficiency conservation of the governments resources and 
speedy adjudication of the cases walsh said 
legal experts said north was a logical choice as the leadoff 
defendant 
you pick north first because he is the top banana in terms of 
expansiveness of the evidence said former us attorney joseph 
digenova 
it gives you the chance if you are only to have one trial to 
get most of your evidence in and tell your story about the 
conspiracy he said referring to the possibility of presidential 
pardons that might avert subsequent trials 
normally you lead with strength said e lawrence barcella 
a former federal prosecutor here if you get a conviction you 
therefore may likely get a succeeding defendant to cave in and 
plead guilty 
the strategy could backfire if you lose the strongest case and 
the evidence against the other defendants is the same barcella 
said you have a bit of a dilemma as to whether or not you can go 
forward with succeeding prosecutions 
gesell had given walsh until today to decide whether he wanted 
to proceed first with north or poindexter the judge said they 
should be tried first because the independent counsel law deals 
with prosecution of high government officials 
by sheer numbers the probability of getting a conviction 
against north is greater he is named in 16 counts of the 
indictment while poindexter is charged in seven 
north is accused of conspiring to illegally use a taxexempt 
foundation to raise money to help arm the contras and he is charged 
with converting to his own use 4300 of the 90000 in travelers 
checks he was given by a contra leader for expenses incurred 
helping the rebels 
unlike poindexter he is also accused of personally profiting 
from the venture 
the indictment also charges him with accepting an illegal 
gratuity a 15000 security fence that was installed around his 
suburban virginia house that secord is accused of financing 
north is also charged with obstructing the fbis investigation 
to determine who paid for the fence

survey published today in the washington post suggested 
and another poll conducted for usa today and cable news

the ticket but the abc newspost survey found that twothirds of

a jordanian couple were convicted 
thursday of plotting to murder their unwanted soninlaw and two of 
his relatives and have their bodies mutilated to avenge the family 
honor 
a broward circuit court jury deliberated six hours before 
finding saud tarawneh guilty of three counts of conspiracy to 
commit murder and one count of solicitation to commit firstdegree 
murder 
his wife ghada was convicted of the three conspiracy counts but 
was acquitted of solicitation no one was injured in the alleged 
plot 
i love my daughter mrs tarawneh 44 said after the 
verdicts were announced 
the prosecution contended during the weeklong trial that the 
plot was hatched because the tarawnehs were angered that their 
daughter raniah had married her syrian cousin in 1986 over their 
objections and moved to tamarac 
the tarawnehs who left jordan 18 years ago and live in toledo 
ohio were arrested last february prosecutors said tarawneh a 
gynecologist and his wife a nurse plotted the murder of mouataz 
abdulsamad his sister and mother to avenge the elopement 
the prosecution also argued tarawneh believed the killings 
along with the preservation of certain body parts and color photos 
of the corpses would enable him to restore the familys honor in 
his native jordan 
the tarawnehs plans allegedly included instructions for the 
killer to hang all three people take photographs of the bodies and 
mutilate them 
the defense portrayed tarawneh 46 as a paranoid alcoholic 
easily manipulated and sometimes out of touch with reality his 
wife is a borderline psychotic according to a clinical 
psychologist called by the defense 
defense lawyer barry roderman said the tarawnehs were exploited 
and deceived by ron petrillo a private investigator who uncovered 
the alleged plot

republican george bush has shifted his 
selfproclaimed underdog presidential campaign into a frontal 
lookattherecord attack on democratic candidate michael 
dukakis 
saying its time to start swinging now that the party 
nominating processes are all but finished bush on leveled a 
broadside against dukakis accusing him of camouflaging leftwing 
views with moderate tones 
bushs harddriving speech thursday to a receptive texas state 
gop convention marked the first time this year that the vice 
president has taken on the massachusetts governor in a 
pointbypoint recital of their differences 
en route to texas aboard air force two campaign manager lee 
atwater had billed the bush speech as signaling a major change in 
strategy although bush had often spoken negatively of various 
dukakis stands in recent weeks the vice president had not gone to 
such lengths to show where the pair part company 
bushs campaign aides said the time had come for the vice 
president to say where he and dukakis differ on issues 
if the public doesnt see any difference between the two by 
election day said one highranking campaign official then the 
time for a change thing is going to benefit dukakis 
atwater indicated that the emerging bush strategy between now 
and the august nominating convention in new orleans will involve 
the vice president holding almost daily news conferences and make 
his position clearer on a number of issues 
bush trailing dukakis in public opinion polls and leading the 
democrat by only seven percentage points in a texas poll of his 
adopted home state told reporters that he wanted to begin 
spelling out the differences 
i will do it factually i will do it fairly i want to get it 
all together he told a news conference here 
and ill begin with five words that are an underlying theme of 
this campaign lets look at the record 
both bush and atwater indicated the vice president will give 
little thought to choosing a running mate until dukakis makes his 
choice in atlanta in july 
he wants to see the democrats throw their card on the table 
atwater said 
the campaign manager also said the bush camp believes that 
president reagan will prove a great campaign asset although 
atwater said there has been no decision yet on just what specific 
role the president will play in the fall campaign 
in the meantime bush said he was happy with his campaign 
organization despite negative poll results and atwater suggested 
publicly that treasury secretary james a baker iii might soon be 
named campaign chairman 
in his speech interrupted frequently by applause bush attacked 
dukakis on several fronts accusing the democrat of favoring tax 
increases aggressive irs audits of taxpayers and being soft on 
crime bush also said that dukakis would undermine us military 
strength and weaken americas ability to wield influence around the 
world 
bush was traveling to denver today to carry the same message to 
a meeting of westernstate republicans 
leslie dach a dukakis campaign spokesman reacted to the bush 
speech by saying the vice president had resorted to mudslinging 
and tearingdown because of bushs standing in the polls 
bush said dukakis is an articulate defender of a flawed world 
view a man who holds strong convictions and who speaks in moderate 
tones but his views and values are often in my judgment out of 
the mainstream 
bush said its uphill for us because there may be a large 
sentiment among us voters in favor of change 
after eight years of one party in the white house no matter 
how successful some good people will yearn for a change he 
said hoping that change will mean improvement 
and its our job to let them know that this time in this 
case change and improvement comes from the incumbent the 
incumbent vice president 
governor dukakis his foreign policy views born in harvard 
yards boutique would cut the muscle of our defense he said 
i will not do that 
bush said dukakis would undermine economic growth as well 
when i wanted to learn the ways of the world i didnt go to 
the kennedy scool i came to texas i didnt go to a symposium on 
job creation i started a business i didnt study a monograph on 
the effects of economic growth i met a payroll

interns and residents in new york hospitals will 
no longer be scheduled for mindnumbing 36hour shifts and 
100hourplus work weeks under hospital rules adopted thursday by 
a state health panel 
the action curbs a training system for young doctors that 
critics have condemned as part hazing and part labor exploitation 
dehumanizing to the trainees and dangerous to patients 
a resident typically is paid 24000 a year which works out to 
less than 5 an hour for a 100hour work week 
the state health commissioner dr david axelrod a champion of 
the reforms said he expected new yorks example to spearhead a 
national trend 
new york with 13000 residents and interns has 16 percent of 
the nations doctors in training while an additional 6 percent are 
in teaching hospitals in massachusetts where similar rules are 
about to be adopted axelrod said 
a review of doctor training was pushed by axelrod in the wake of 
a grand jury report faulting the hospital care that resulted in the 
death in 1984 of libby zion 18yearold daughter of a wellknown 
writer sidney zion 
among major benefits of the hospital code revisions will be 
better judgment by the physicians in training because they will 
no longer be sleepdeprived and fatigued axelrod said 
the new rules put a 12hour limit on emergency room shifts for 
interns residents and attending physicians 
in other services young doctors in training will not be 
required to put in more than 24 hours a shift and their work week 
may not average more than 80 hours during any four consecutive 
weeks 
they will have at least eight free hours between work shifts and 
at least one full day off every week 
they also will be barred from moonlighting at other hospitals 
axelrod said the 12hour er shift which is to take effect as of 
oct 1 already is followed in 95 percent of the states teaching 
hospitals most of the other new rules were adopted with an 
effective date of next july 1 1989 
the 32member state hospital review and planning council adopted 
the code revisions without dissent 
its a great day for patients and doctors long overdue 
said dr robert schwartz leader of the committee of interns and 
residents at kings county hospital where he is completing a 
fouryear residency in psychiatry 
schwartz said he worked 100 to 105 hours a week as an intern and 
that 36hour shifts are scheduled routinely and you generally 
dont sleep he said when youre on call and you sleep two 
hours thats a great night 
schwartz said the reforms will not require hospitals hiring 
more interns and residents but rather a redistribution and 
rethinking of how the work is currently done reorganizing the 
shift

sex for sale at harrods prince charless polo 
manager in a massage parlor sex frolics in a parliamentary shower 
room englands cricket captain fired for having female company in 
his hotel room 
recent weeks have yielded an unusually rich harvest of lurid 
tales for londons anythinggoes tabloid newspapers with the 
firing of captain michael gatting on thursday it seems that not 
even the genteel world of cricket is being spared 
gatting 31 was summoned by the team selectors to answer 
newspaper allegations that two of his players had sex on a lawn 
outside their hotel sunday night and that he took a woman to his 
room for sex 
the alleged offense as far as the selectors were concerned was 
that it happened while a fiveday game or test was in progress 
against the west indies in nottinghamshire 
warnings had previously been issued to all england players 
concerning the standard of behavior expected of them at all times 
both on and off the field and these had been ignored said a 
statement by the test and county cricket board the games 
governing body 
gatting who is married and has two children issued a statement 
saying i categorically deny allegations of sexual impropriety 
which have been made against me by certain newspapers and said 
he would sue them the allegations appeared wednesday and thursday 
in the sun today and the daily mirror 
the cricket board said the selectors believed gattings account 
so why fire him 
because the statement said gatting behaved irresponsibly 
during a test match by inviting female company to his room for a 
drink in the late evening 
therefore it added in the genteel language that still governs 
the cricketing world the invitation to mike gatting to captain 
the england team has been withdrawn and gatting did not 
wish to be considered for selection for the team for the second 
game starting june 16 
the other three scheduled games were not mentioned and gatting 
brushed reporters aside as he left 
youve got to be extra careful for the good name of cricket 
former captain ted dexter said in a tv interview at the same 
time its a pretty sad day if a young man cant meet a nice girl 
and spend a happy evening with her without being accused of frolics 
and romps 
today editor david montgomery told the same interviewer 
perhaps the selectors should have more of a sense of humor about 
lively behavior off the pitch 
but team manager micky stewart told a news conference cricket 
has been let down by it english cricket 
the scandal isnt yet over four other players will be 
questioned about sex allegations today stewart said 
gatting a stocky bearded londoner did not attend an 
uppercrust school like most previous captains and his appointment 
as captain in 1986 was greeted by the observer newspaper as 
another step toward the classless society 
but although gatting was decorated by queen elizabeth ii for his 
cricketing prowess his captaincy has been lackluster he has won 
only two of his 23 international games as captain and the west 
indies match ended tuesday in a draw last year he was officially 
censured for having a foulmouthed shouting match with a pakistani 
umpire during a match in faisalabad 
gatting got into further trouble for writing a book giving his 
version of the faisalabad incident and had to promise the cricket 
board he would withdraw the relevant chapter 
cricket is not the only english institution to take a tarnishing 
in recent weeks 
ronald ferguson father of sarah the duchess of york and polo 
manager of prince charles narrowly escaped expulsion from his polo 
club last month after the tabloid sunday people photographed him 
leaving a london massage parlor 
two weeks ago a lawmaker for the opposition labor party publicly 
denied newspaper allegations that he frolicked with a secretary in 
a house of commons shower room and on wednesday the mirror claimed 
saleswomen at the harrods department store were selling sexual 
favors to customers 
harrods said the women worked for perfume sellers using space in 
the department store and were not harrods employees but added an 
investigation was under way

the maker of the suzuki samurai took the 
offense in a battle over the vehicles safety disputing the 
validity of tests by consumer reports magazine that found the 
samurai dangerously prone to roll over 
the tests by consumers union the magazines publisher 
apparently were intended to persuade the government to adopt new 
stability standards for sportutility vehicles like the samurai 
suzuki executive doug mazza said thursday 
the suzuki samurai has been falsely accused and it does not 
have a design error mazza said we have absolute confidence in 
its safety record and roadworthiness in the united states 
calling the test results inaccurate and defamatory mazza 
vice president of breabased american suzuki motor corp said the 
company was considering a lawsuit against consumers union 
consumers union stands by its tests said david berliner 
assistant director of the nonprofit organization based in mount 
vernon ny he denied the tests were intended to influence federal 
regulations 
consumers union said last week the samurai rolled over in abrupt 
maneuvers because it is too tall for its small wheelbase similar 
vehicles passed the test the group called for the immediate recall 
of all 160000 samurais on us roads and reimbursement of their 
owners 
but mazza said government accident statistics along with tests 
conducted by an automotive engineering consultant for suzuki show 
the fourwheeldrive vehicle is safe under typical driving 
conditions safer than some other vehicles of its type 
at simultaneous news conferences in new york detroit and los 
angeles mazza showed films of samurais passing a number of what 
were described as rigorous tests of the cars ability to stay 
upright 
for years the consumers union has been pressing the government 
for an unrealistic rollover standard mazza said what better 
way than pressing the smallest japanese automaker with the no 1 
selling sportutility vehicle 
publicity about the consumers union tests is expected to cut 
samurai sales mazza said adding that the company has boosted its 
advertising budget by 15 million a week to counter consumer fears 
raised by the tests the 8500 vehicle is promoted as a fun car 
for the youth market 
suzukis auto engineering consultant jon mckibben of irvine 
said it appeared the consumers union test driver deliberately 
turned the samurai more sharply than other sportutility vehicles 
in the obstacleavoidance test sportutility vehicles are 
jeeplike light trucks 
mckibben acknowledged that he knew of the test only by watching 
a videotape of it 
berliner of the consumers union responded we never suggested 
that the samurai will turn over every time a driver swerves to 
avoid an obstacle in the road we said that its design creates 
enough chance of that happening to the typical driver that it poses 
an unacceptable risk 
the samurais in the consumers union tests may have been made 
unstable by 300pound outriggers bolted to the cars to keep 
them from rolling over completely mckibben said 
however consumers union contends the outriggers actually should 
make the vehicles more stable 
the national highway traffic safety administration said there 
have been 44 reported incidents of samurais rolling over involving 
53 injuries and 16 deaths 
consumers union filed a petition with the nhtsa seeking rules 
requiring that sportutility vehicles be put through road tests for 
safety rather than just requiring them to meet design standards 
suzuki said its study of federal statistics on fatal accidents 
found that in the last two years there were three fatal accidents 
in which a samurai may have rolled over on a relatively flat 
surface in two of those cases the drivers had been drinking and 
none of the victims wore seat belts mckibben said

the leftist sandinista government and 
the usbacked rebels have broken off peace talks that the 
insurgents called the final attempt at negotiating an end to the 
6yearold war 
after the negotiations ended thursday both sides said a 
temporary truce would remain in effect for an undetermined amount 
of time 
no new date was announced for resuming the talks aimed at 
fashioning a permament halt to the fighting that has claimed more 
than 26000 lives 
despite the breakdown rebel leader alfredo cesar told 
journalists thursday night we have reiterated our deep 
conviction to look for solutions to the conflict in our motherland 
in a civilized way 
each side blamed the other for the discussions failure 
the nations defense minister gen humberto ortega head of the 
sandinista delegation said the contra rebels held irrational 
positions and maintained an antinegotiation attitude against 
the peace 
in a statement released in washington rebel leader adolfo 
calero countered that the government demonstrated its hostility 
toward any meaningful solution to the oppression in nicaragua 
the goal of the fourth round of negotiations which began on 
tuesday was to end the war and install democratic reforms in 
accordance with a preliminary peace plan signed on march 23 in the 
village of sapoa on the costa rican border 
thursday morning the government put forth its most liberal 
proposal to date and granted a key rebel demand to institute 
democratic reforms before the rebels put down their weapons 
the contras rejected the proposal saying the sandinistas did 
not guarantee that the measures would be enacted before they 
disarmed 
the sandinista proposal included freedom of expression reform 
of electoral laws separation of the ruling sandinista party from 
the state and the right to strike 
the government proposal also would have granted political 
amnesty in steps with the first 200 prisoners freed after the 
signing of an agreement and the last freed on sept 28 
the contras offered a proposal calling for total amnesty for all 
political prisoners within five days of signing 
the rebels said there are 4207 political prisoners while the 
international red cross seen here as sympathetic to the 
government put the figure at 3324 
the contras also demanded separating the armed forces from the 
ruling sandinista national liberation front in name as well as 
actions the govenment agreed to the separation and independence 
of the powers of the state 
the rebels have insisted on a timetable for enacting political 
reforms including pluralism freedom of expression the right to 
strike electoral reforms and guarantees of a mixed economy 
the sandinista proposal said those changes would be discussed 
during 60 days among the 14 opposition political parties and eight 
rebel representatives after rebel fighters gathered in designated 
zones to disarm 
the talks would be held before the date set for the fighters to 
lay down their arms the contras said they needed guarantees that 
the democratic measures would not only be discussed but enacted 
the government said in earlier meetings that several points in 
the rebel plan were unacceptable they included a temporary 
suspension of the military draft permission for the contras 
nicaraguan resistance group to open offices in nicaragua and 
licenses for private television stations 
the rebels said that if the sandinistas wanted to show good 
will they would bend to their demands 
it is with deep consternation we announce that an agreement 
for a permanent ceasefire was not reached cesar told reporters 
the war that our people have suffered for seven years and that 
has stopped almost entirely should not be renewed the resistance 
will not initiate offensive military operations he said 
ortega speaking later to reporters blamed recalcitrant 
positions of the reagan administration and said the rebels had 
not intended to sign an agreement 
american lawyer paul reichler who serves as a sandinista 
negotiator said earlier that members of the reagan administration 
did not want a peace plan to be signed so there would be a chance 
for additional military aid to the rebels 
congress voted down president reagans request earlier this year 
for renewed contra military funding which ended feb 29 the 
united states has backed the rebels since 1981 
reichler put most of the fault for the talks failure on col 
enrique bermudez highestranking contra military leader he quoted 
cesar as telling him during private meetings that bermudez would 
respond to orders from the us state department 
cesar and bermudez said reichlers comments were an attempt to 
create divisions within the rebel ranks

each night she builds a dam each 
morning he breaks it down 
this frustrating relationship has been going on since last month 
between a beaver just doing what comes naturally and a town 
official just doing his job 
we havent come up with a name for her yet said 
conservation commission chairman james mcbride but you should 
hear some of the names i call her when im out there in the morning 
knocking down the dam 
the beaver bedevilment began for mcbride in late may when a dam 
built by the animals on deep brook caused flooding on nearby 
streets snares were placed around the stream to catch the pair of 
beavers alive but only the male beaver was nabbed and released in 
a 330acre bog across town last week 
attempts to apprehend the beavers mate have been unsuccessful 
shes a shrewd one said mcbride she hasnt come near the 
traps but dont worry well catch her 
mcbride who theorizes the female beaver may have become 
familiar with the traps appearance pulled the snares on thursday 
well put them back on monday and maybe well catch her off 
guard said mcbride maybe shell get careless 
mcbride also has hopes that the urge to mate may deflect some of 
the beavers attention from her dambuilding mission 
its mating season so we want to get them together he 
said right now the mate is out in the bog by himself eating 
poplar trees their favorite thing to eat 
despite mcbrides matchmaking aspirations the beaver may yet 
get to keep her dam after all if the beaver is found to be 
nursing she will be returned to the brook 
if shes already given birth then well put her back for the 
summer said mcbride theres nothing else we can do she would 
win 
meanwhile the commission has delayed installation of a 
stateordered pipe system to regulate water flow through the brook 
he said the pipes could kill any beavers in the brook by 
lowering the water depth to a point where it would freeze solid to 
the bottom in winter 
one way or another well get the flooding problem figured 
out said mcbride the first thing on my mind at this point is 
catching that beaver

yasser arafat and the plo emerged from 
the arab summit meeting greatly strengthened for their 
confrontation with israel by the unqualified material and moral 
support of the arab leaders 
saudi arabia and the other oilrich persian gulf states for the 
first time agreed to pay the palestine liberation organization a 
substantial subsidy to intensify the 6monthold palestinian 
uprising in the west bank and the gaza strip 
the amount of the subsidy officially was kept secret to avoid 
showing the arab hand to the israelis but delegates said it was 
set at 118 million for the first year 
this fell short of the 600 million a year arafat said he needed 
to keep the full heat of the revolt on the israelis but it meant a 
solid boost to what the palestinian leader has described as the 
stonethrowing revolution 
the oilexporting states told the plo they could not meet its 
full financial needs because their income has been hurt by an 
unstable world oil market and by the effects of the iraniraq war 
arafat was widely believed to have overstated his real needs in the 
expectation that his demands would not be fully met 
arafats associates made no secret that he was overjoyed with 
the outcome of the summit 
the plo leader said the money would be used to pay relief and 
medical treatment for injured rioters help the families of those 
killed or injured and compensate strikers for lost wages 
arafat did not specify what other uses he had in mind for the 
windfall but it was clear the subsidy could also allow the plo to 
step up its efforts to smuggle small arms and communications and 
sabotage equipment to the rioters 
the conference stresses its full commitment to extend all the 
support needed to secure the continuation and escalation of the 
uprising under the leadership of the plo the summits final 
communique declared 
however tightly israel tries to keep the 15 million 
palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip sealed off from 
the outside world never an easy task at best of times the plos 
riot fund will not make it any easier 
the arab leaders made a further significant gesture in arafats 
favor by deciding the plo henceforth should be the sole master of 
the insurgency fund this meant arafat will no longer have to share 
any part of his funds with jordan or with a joint plojordanian 
support committee 
the summit also endorsed previous arab decisions to recognize 
the plo as the sole and legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people automatically branding nonplo palestinians 
who choose to work with the israelis in the occupied territories as 
traitors 
it reiterated arafats earlier scornful dismissal of us 
secretary of state george p shultzs latest peace plan and 
insisted that the plo must participate with full delegation status 
in any international peace conference 
the united states and israel regard the plo as a terrorist 
organization and refuse to envisage any role for it in the peace 
process 
the arab leaders went beyond previous summits by endorsing more 
strongly than ever the palestinians right to set up a sovereign 
state in the west bank and east jerusalem captured by israel in 
the 1967 war israel has proclaimed the reunited holy city as its 
capital and is unlikely to relinquish its control of it 
nonetheless the summits endorsement in effect strengthened 
arafats status as a fullfledged head of state in arab eyes it 
was likely to boost him even further in the eyes of soviet leaders 
who have long supported him 
arafat also strengthened his position against his more militant 
rivals within the plo by apparently achieving a full reconciliation 
with syrias sovietbacked president hafez assad their relations 
seemed to have warmed considerably since they met in damascus in 
april following five years of open hostility 
assad conferred privately with arafat for more than two hours 
shortly before the final session 
on the strength of what he believes is a new relationship with 
assad arafat soon may be in a position to beat down his rivals in 
the palestinian camp these include the syrianbacked abu moussa 
who has led several armed revolts against the plo chairman in 
recent years

in addition 80 percent of 1500 adults surveyed in february 
said they knew a lot about aids compared with only 69 percent 
who said they knew a lot or a fair amount in a similar 
survey last year 
it is gratifying to see that the aids education efforts of the 
past year have helped said dr james h sammons ama executive 
vice president in a statement accompanying results of the survey 
although we are encouraged by the progress the ama will 
continue to work toward having 100 percent of the public confident 
in their knowledge about aids he added in the statement in the 
organizations weekly newspaper american medical news 
the february survey found that 68 percent of adults said 
children with aids should be allowed to attend regular class 18 
percent said they should not and 14 percent were unsure 
that compares with a 1987 survey in which 57 percent of adults 
favored regular school attendance for youngsters with aids 23 
percent opposed it and 20 percent were unsure 
the ama said two years ago that no valid reason exists to bar 
most children with aids from classes and the american academy of 
pediatrics has since expressed a similar view 
surgeon general c everett koop said in his report on aids a 
year ago that children could be allowed to attend classes with a 
physicians approval 
more than 1000 children under age 13 have been diagnosed with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the national centers for 
disease control in atlanta began tracking cases in 1981 the cdc 
said thursday 
most children with aids have gotten the deadly disease from 
their mothers with the rest contracting it through transfusions of 
contaminated blood or blood products or from undetermined causes 
the survey commissioned by the ama was conducted by 
tarrancesri of houston and involved interviews with 1500 adults 
using a random sample of all residential telephones in the united 
states the ama said its margin of error was plus or minus 25 
percentage points 
in a separate recent survey of 1000 physicians the ama found 
that 80 percent thought children with aids should be allowed to 
attend classes compared with 78 percent in 1987 the organization 
said 
only 11 percent of the physicians surveyed said children with 
aids should be barred from school compared with 14 percent in 
1987 the ama said nine percent were unsure in this years survey 
compared with 8 percent in 1987 it said 
the margin of error in the physician survey was plus or minus 3 
percentage points the ama said 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

there is no evidence that mr hart or the other senatorial 
candidates were aware of the illegal contributions us attorney 
robert bonner said at a news conference 
thirteen of karls former employees who were used as conduits 
for the alleged contributions were not indicted because most of 
them cooperated in the investigation and have been given limited

while 38300 went to us house and senate candidates

the working soviet mother spends no more than 30 
minutes a week raising her children and her mate spends only six 
minutes a sociologist said in a plea for mothers to make children 
their prime mission 
such negative phenomena as juvenile delinquency are largely 
explained by the inadequate attention shown to children by their 
parents tatyana zaslavskaya told the official tass news agency 
in an interview published thursday 
the remarks of the prominent sociologist one of the 
theoreticians of mikhail s gorbachevs drive for economic and 
social change clash with longstanding soviet orthodoxy 
the government has maintained for decades that its network of 
daycare centers kindergartens and schools could raise children 
while both parents occupy fulltime jobs 
but ms zaslavskaya who conducted a poll of soviet parents 
rejected that logic 
the time spent by working mothers on spiritual communication 
with their children that is directly on their upbringing does 
not exceed according to our poll findings a weekly 30 minutes 
she said 
the figure for men is even lower or six minutes a week the 
soviet sociologist said 
ms zaslavskayas conclusion the high rate of employment 
among workingage women 94 percent tells especially adversely 
on their prime mission the upbringing of children 
the recent western phenomenon of the super mom has been 
known for years in the soviet union where it is wryly referred to 
as the problem of two jobs 
after a typical soviet woman finishes her job at the factory 
shop or office she heads home where shopping cooking cleaning 
and keeping house await her 
her husband traditionally feels it is beneath him to help 
either with the housework or the children 
a 1987 report to a soviet national conference on women said that 
because of the lack of home appliances and the need to spend hours 
in lines while shopping the time expended on housework by a 
woman is almost equal to the length of another entire working day 
ms zaslavskaya the president of the soviet sociological 
association proposed that more soviet women stay home and rear 
their children fulltime 
so far that has not been possible in the soviet union because 
of economics she said most men wont be able to ensure a 
dignified life for their families if their wives dont work and 
earn money too 
the average soviet industrial wage is now only about 200 rubles 
or the equivalent of about 330 a month 
but ms zaslavskaya said that as economic reforms instituted by 
gorbachev begin to bear fruit wages will be pegged to individual 
job performance or the output of a given work collective and two 
incomes will not be needed to keep a family financially afloat 
the choice between having a job and being a housewife is thus 
going to become a reality tass quoted her as saying 
ms zaslavskaya said surveys show that 40 percent of soviet 
women with children would like to be homemakers if the wages of 
their husbands were at least equal to the current combined 
earnings of man and wife 
she called on a nationwide conference of the communist party 
convening june 28 to discuss ways to reduce excessively high 
employment levels among women 
but that seems doubtful as the kremlin leadership tries to 
mobilize all the countrys economic resources behind gorbachevs 
restructuring campaign 
women now constitute 51 percent of the nations 130 
millionmember labor force and often perform exacting and delicate 
work that managers say would be more poorly done by men 
the soviet union remains a resolutely maledominated society 
although the 1917 bolshevik revolution proclaimed the equality of 
the sexes only one woman aleksandra p biryukova serves on the 
powerful communist party secretariat and all 13 voting members of 
the ruling politburo are men

the supreme court has upheld an injunction 
barring japanese fleets in an area off the alaska coast from salmon 
fishing with huge gillnets a technique that traps porpoises and 
other marine mammals 
the move thursday was hailed by environmentalists and a native 
alaskan fishermens organization it was a defeat for the reagan 
administration and the commerce department which had issued the 
permits for fishing with the gillnets 
we know at least were not going to have this ecological 
disaster played out in our waters this summer and were hopeful it 
is going to be stopped for good said alan reichman a 
seattlebased spokesman for the greenpeace environmental group 
the federation of japan fisheries cooperative association and 
the reagan administration had asked the high court to overturn the 
injunction and permit fishing to resume pending the high courts 
consideration of a formal appeal 
the justice department said preventing the japanese from fishing 
for salmon may prompt japan to withdraw from the international 
convention that currently prohibits japanese fishermen from fishing 
for north american salmon in a large area of the north pacific 
the order also will almost certainly lead to the removal from 
japanese fishing vessels of the united states observers who now 
monitor the incidental taking of marine mammals by japanese 
fishermen it said 
the injunction bars gillnet fishing by japanese fleets during 
the junejuly salmon season in an area of the bering sea and north 
pacific 
the us circuit court of appeals last february upheld a federal 
judges preliminary injunction halting gillnet fishing by the 
japanese inside the zone 
the appeals court by a 21 vote said a commerce department 
permit to allow use of the ninemilelong gillnets violated a 
federal animal protection law 
the permit would allow the unintentional catching in the nets of 
5250 dalls porpoise plus seas lions fur seals and killer 
whales the mammals become ensnared in the nets which stretch for 
hundreds of miles 
the injunction in the case does not prevent the japanese from 
using gillnets beyond the 200mile protected zone 
the injunction was obtained by the center for environmental 
education and the kokechik fishermens association 
supporters of the ban said the government was exaggerating the 
impact of the injunction 
they said the japanese already had scaled down their fishing 
operations in anticipation that the court ban would remain in 
effect during the current season 
the environmentalists said if the injunction was lifted it 
would have enormous and irreparable impact on marine mammals 
within a 200mile zone off the alaska coast that is at issue in the 
dispute 
the cases are secretary of commerce vs kokechik fishermens 
association a906 and federation of japan salmon fisheries vs 
kokechik a907

us sanctions designed to push gen 
manuel antonio noriega from power are hurting american companies in 
panama and could force some of them to close businessmen say 
american companies are caught between their obligations to 
panama and to the united states which has ordered them not to pay 
taxes to their host country 
under a complex 52page us treasury department order signed 
in april by president reagan as part of the economic sanctions 
aimed at overthrowing noriega the companies face fines or 
imprisonment if they pay taxes services or duties to panama in 
addition they are prohibited from contributing to the panamanian 
social security institute 
they are shooting at the wrong target said federico denton 
executive director of the panamanianamerican chamber of commerce 
in a recent interview 
you could not even buy a panamanian air mail stamp if you were 
an american company operating here when this was first announced 
said denton who added that some exceptions were made later when 
us companies protested 
noriega who has been indicted in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges heads the panamanian defense forces and is the 
power behind panamas goverment 
when president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire him in 
february noriega had him ousted delvalle is now in hiding 
there are more than 60 us subsidiaries here with a total 
investment in plant and inventory of more than 2 billion 
the sanctions practically keep us from operating here said 
carlos rodriguez manager of colgatepalmolive it is a catch22 
situation we abide by us law and we violate panamanian law or 
vice versa 
the panamanian government has been very flexible and has not 
demanded payments or taken over any of the companies company 
managers say 
the government does not want the us companies to leave and 
knows that it is not their fault rodriguez said 
denton said that to keep their employees covered under the 
panamanian social security system some of the companies simply 
hand over the money to the employee to pay into the system 
directly others have expanded their own private medical plans for 
the employees 
companies like texaco had to collect a gasoline sales tax and 
turn it over to the government every month to avoid us penalties 
texaco now does not collect the tax but at the moment of purchase 
the buyer separates the tax and hands it over directly to a 
government collector 
now the government gets the tax money every day instead of 
once a month said a us businessman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
meanwhile tons of supplies stack up in panamanian customs 
because the companies cannot get them out without paying taxes 
the companies also cannot repatriate dividends because they must 
first pay taxes 
we told them in washington that they were hurting the wrong 
people that we would have to dismiss panamanian workers someone 
there detached from reality told us that there is a sacrifice 
quota that must be paid rodriguez said 
us businessmen believe the measures are not going to overthrow 
noriega and his regime 
but they are going to affect us international 
competitiveness rodriguez said us companies should not be 
used as tools of us policy 
colgatepalmolive has not dismissed any employees but has 
reduced working hours by 50 percent 
danilo gutierrez sale manager for alambres y cables de panama 
a subsidiary of phelpsdodge said the company is about four weeks 
away from using up all its inventory it manufactures cable and 
telephone wires for local markets and exports to the caribbean 
including puerto rico 
our sales to us markets were also reduced considerably 
becasue we were removed from the preferential treatment system

europe could be heading for a cocaine epidemic as 
drug dealers search for new markets to replace dwindling demand in 
the united states experts at an international conference on drug 
abuse said 
researchers at the fourday international drug abuse 
epidemiology conference in rome said thursday there are signs that 
cocaine use is increasing in europe especially among users of 
heroin and amphetamines 
nicholas kozel an official with the usbased national 
institute on drug abuse a sponsor of the conference said cocaine 
traffickers have moved into europe because use of the drug has 
leveled off in the united states 
the weak us dollar has contributed to the spread because the 
drug has become more affordable to europeans he said 
the economic conditions really influence the spread of drugs 
because the bottom line of drug trafficking is dollars and very big 
dollars kozel said in an interview 
cocaine use in europe is expected to follow patterns set in the 
united states in the last three to five years said christopher 
luckett secretary to the pompidou group a francebased drug 
research organization representing 19 european countries 
weve learned that cocaine use booms it peaks and then it 
drops and we know we have to go through this in europe the 
question is how big is this boom going to be luckett said 
heroin currently is the most abused drug in europe followed by 
amphetamines he said 
in the united states a 1985 survey by the national institute on 
drug abuse showed that 22 million people over the age of 11 had 
used cocaine at least once kozel said 
more recent surveys show cocaine use is tapering off among the 
general us population because there is a growing awareness of the 
drugs dangers kozel said but cocaine use has spread into the 
inner city areas as the drug has become more affordable he said

japan has asked the us navy to move its night 
practice landings from a densely populated area to the remote 
island of iwo jima site of one of the fiercest usjapanese 
battles in world war ii 
foreign ministry spokesman koichi haraguchi said thursday that 
us officials have not yet responded to a suggestion that they 
move the practice flights from atsugi air base in the tokyo area to 
iwo jima about 750 miles to the south 
haraguchi said the japanese government proposed the temporary 
move to counter mounting complaints from atsugi residents about 
noise 
in addition strong opposition from citizens of miyake island 
selected by the government as the site of a new permanent night 
landing strip has slowed construction plans there 
the japanese government position is still the same regarding 
miyake haraguchi told reporters at a regular news briefing 
defense administration officials selected miyake island 115 
miles from tokyo as the most suitable site for a new night landing 
airstrip for us planes from the carrier midway based in japan 
but 85 percent of the islands 4300 residents have signed 
petitions against the planned air strip 
miyake village head haruo terasawa elected in 1984 on an 
antiairstrip platform welcomed the iwo jima proposal as one 
fruitful outcome of the islanders opposition movement 
but we will not give up on our fight against a permanent air 
strip here until the government completely abandons its plan he 
told the associated press 
setsuko sakuraba spokeswoman for the defense facilities 
administration agency said a temporary site was necessary 
because construction of the landing strip on miyake will take a 
long time due to the opposition movement 
the agency handles all construction projects designed to support 
us military needs in accordance with the usjapan security 
treaty implemented in 1952 and revised in 1960 
foreign ministry spokesman haruguchi said iwo jima was only one 
proposed landing site but he did not name any other possible

a promising vaccine to prevent 
recurrence of melanoma is being tested in nationwide clinical 
trials involving at least 200 patients suffering from the deadliest 
form of skin cancer its developer says 
what it means is there is potential for some hope and perhaps 
were going to be able to immunize a patient against potential 
recurrence said marc wallack a cancer specialist and chairman 
of general surgery of mount sinai medical center 
wallack on thursday announced the beginning of the threeyear 
trial of the vaccine he has been testing for 15 years 
melanoma which strikes about 27000 americans each year is 
easily treated by removing the tumor if the disease is discovered 
before cancer cells spread but death rates can climb as high as 70 
percent if it spreads to lymph nodes 
the disease resists traditional chemical and radiation 
treatments making it the hardest skin cancer to treat said 
wallack 
cancer vaccines arent a new idea and vaccines for various 
cancers are being studied around the nation like others wallacks 
aims to prevent the disease from recurring by energizing the bodys 
immune system to seek out and destroy stray malignant cells that 
may have broken off tumors 
we specifically activate the immune system against the 
patients melanoma said wallack who will oversee the trials 
involving at least 200 patients whose tumors have been recently 
removed and whose lymph nodes have been invaded 
it will be a doubleblind study meaning neither doctors nor 
patients will know who gets the vaccine and who gets a placebo 
the trials are beginning at the university of florida duke 
university in durham nc the md anderson cancer institute in 
houston the university of alabama and emory university in 
atlanta wallack said 
the vaccine is created by infecting four types of melanoma cells 
with smallpox vaccine viruses membranes from the infected cells 
are injected into patients weekly for 13 weeks then biweekly for 
the rest of a year 
wallack believes the smallpox wakes up the immune system 
prompting it to act against the cancer 
wallack plans to compare in followups the cancer recurrence and 
survival rates of the two groups of patients he hopes to repeat 
the results of early experiments which helped at least 15 percent 
of smaller numbers of patients 
surgery is very important to remove the primary lesion and 
also any lymph nodes that are positive after this thats when 
this approach specific immunotherapy comes into play he said 
a different type of melanoma vaccine is being developed by dr 
philip livingston of sloankettering cancer center in new york 
im not saying one is better than the other but its a 
different approach said livingston whose work uses purified 
chemicals taken from cancer cells 
researchers wonder if extracts from the melanoma cells used in 
wallacks study will trigger immune systems for the dozens of types 
of melanoma livingston said 
its a little bit of a shot in the dark in that regard he 
said 
wallack said the four cell types hes using should prove 
effective on all melanomas 
skin cancers are diagnosed in about 500000 americans each year 
and are readily cured by surgical removal except for advanced 
melanoma recent american cancer society figures show of about 
7800 annual skin cancer deaths 5800 were melanoma victims

george bush engaged abctvs nightline anchor 
ted koppel in a combative debate for an hour but the vice 
presidents mind kept wandering back to the memorable 9minute 
faceoff last january with cbs dan rather 
on several occasions during thursday nights nightline 
interview bush called koppel dan and koppel kept reminding 
bush that his name is ted 
koppel spent several minutes of the interview program grilling 
bush on the vice presidents knowledge of the clandestine sales of 
us arms to iran as rather had done in the jan 25 interview on 
cbs evening news 
and after saying at one point that he had no regrets about that 
stormy cbs encounter bush aggressively challenged koppels line of 
questioning telling the abc anchor at one point that theres a 
fatal flaw in your analysis of the impact of the irancontra 
affair on his presidential prospects 
koppel opened with sharp questioning of bushs knowledge of the 
alleged drug dealings of panamanian military leader manuel antonio 
noriega and then challenged bushs statement that it wasnt until 
december 1986 that he knew the full details of the 
armsforhostages deal with iran 
after koppels nightline producers showed a clip from the 
bushrather interview the vice president told the abc anchor 
and yes things went wrong dan ill take the credit for that if 
 
no dans the other fellow koppel retorted 
the abc anchor was in washington interviewing bush live via 
satellite at affiliate ktrk here 
bush said at one point that it was only when he was 
debriefed by sen david durenberger rminn a ranking member 
of the intelligence committee that he became fully aware of the 
armsforhostages connection in december 1986 a month after the 
story became public 
koppel then interrogated bush about a meeting the vice president 
had in july 1986 in israel with amiram nir a counterterrorism 
adviser to thenprime minister shimon peres koppel cited a memo 
written by bush chief of staff craig fuller indicating that nir had 
told the vice president the nature of the armstoiran connection 
i didnt say that i never knew anything about this bush 
said 
said koppel i rarely keep notes for questions but i thought 
i might have to today 
when you were talking to dan koppel said you were 
saying sure we did it to get cia station chief william buckley 
out of lebanon 
you want to start back over it with the rationale of why we 
didnt think it was arms for hostages bush asked 
no i understand the rationale koppel replied 
but you just dont like my answer the vice president 
snapped 
no what im saying is i find your answer inconsistent 
koppel said 
well thats your opinion bush said you ask the 
questions but you dont like the answer what do you want me to 
say 
when bush addressed koppel again by the name dan a few 
moments later the abc anchor said ill tell you what if you 
stop calling me dan try calling me peter or tom or 
did i do it again bush asked hey listen its freudian 
i am not trying to be clever i promise you its freudian 
as they were wrapping up the show bush said to koppel ted i 
apologize for calling you dan i wasnt being smart i cant see 
you im in houston texas and i was not trying to be 
provocative 
not at all responded koppeland i didnt take it that 
way 
next time call me barbara

death by injection early friday for the sexrelated murders of five 
boys an execution he sought hoping to bring peace to his victims 
families 
there was nothing unusual he went peacefully to the execution 
chamber myron march department of corrections director of field 
operations said after bishop was pronounced dead at 1216 am he 
said a statement from bishop would be released later 
bishop 36 was the 99th person to be executed in this country 
and the third in utah since a 1976 us supreme court ruling ended 
a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment and convicted killer 
gary gilmore demanding death was executed by a utah firing squad 
in early 1977 
in the hours before three drugs in succession sodium 
pentothal the muscle relaxant pavulon and potassium chloride 
were dripped by iv into his right arm bishop was lowkey and 
contemplative 
its unbelievable how calm and cool he is even the guards 
cant understand it said mormon bishop heber geurts a volunteer 
chaplain at utah state prison who counseled bishop in his final 
days ive dealt with thousands of inmates in 33 years and hes 
the most sorrowful and repentent and remorseful man ive ever dealt 
with 
an excommunicated mormon eagle scout and bookkeeper bishop 
spent thursday in a 10by15 holding cell in the prisons 
maximumsecurity section his only reading materials were three 
issues of ensign magazine a publication of the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints 
because bishop shunned further appeals civil rights groups did 
not plan to intervene to try to halt the execution 
prison chaplain jay lowe said bishop during a thursday 
afternoon visit said he felt at peace and was not afraid to die 
prison psychologist al carlisle said bishop was a man with 
religious feelings who read the book of mormon 10 times during his 
fours year in prison and used television earphones to block out 
inmates swearing but is afraid that if he were to go back on the 
streets his old impulses would come back 
ive seen remorse in him from the beginning carlisle told a 
news conference bishop believes he will be going into the spirit 
world that it will be more peaceful than here he doesnt believe 
hes been forgiven 
he believes he can continue to work on the other side on these 
problems 
bishop saw his parents for the last time on tuesday and prison 
officials suspended their usual nocontact policy removing 
bishops handcuffs so he could embrace them 
it was a good visit sorrowful they hugged each other 
geurts said 
geurts said bishop generally was in good spirits wednesday but 
wept when they prayed together following a long discussion of 
spiritual matters 
geurts was one of three people bishop asked to witness the 
execution along with l kay gillespie a weber state college 
professor studying the death penalty in utah and kathy luck 
bishops biographer 
bishop was convicted in 1984 of the murders of alonzo daniels 
4 kim peterson 11 danny davis 4 troy ward 6 and graeme 
cunningham 13 
bishop fired his attorneys in february and said he wanted to die 
after the utah supreme court rejected his initial appeal 
bishop murdered his first victim daniels on oct 16 1979 
bishop lured the boy into his apartment with an offer of candy 
when bishop tried to fondle the boy the child cried and threatened 
to tell his mother 
panicking bishop struck daniels on the head with a hammer the 
boy fell to the floor crying and bishop drowned him in the 
bathtub he carried the body out in a box past a woman apparently 
the boys mother who was frantically calling his name 
in the months that followed he relived the experience by 
killing 15 or 20 puppies the same way he killed four of his five 
victims 
it was so stimulating he said a puppy whines just like 
alonzo did i would get frustrated at the whining i would hit them 
with hammers or drown them or strangle them

injection last august for the 1974 torturemurders of three people

the bodies of 22 soldiers who fought and died 
during the war of 1812 are coming home to america for an honorable 
burial 
researchers who studied 36 skeletons unearthed at a battle site 
on the canadian side of the niagara river said thursday they know 
what food the men ate some of their daily hardships and the way 
they died but not their names 
i never expected to be able to identify the bodies said lt 
col joseph whitehorne a historian with the us army 
he said army records of the day were used mostly for tracking 
deserters by making notes of hair color and scars 
whitehorne is part of a 40member team of archeologists and 
historians from the united states and canada who studied the 
remains and compiled a report on their findings 
a study of the bones revealed that hardships the soldiers faced 
led to premature arthritis in men as young as 20 
their legs showed fatigue fractures from carrying heavy packs 
over hundreds of miles in most of the skeletons as many as seven 
discs in each spine were collapsed from physical labor 
seven of the skeletons showed signs of amputations before the 
soldiers died one 17yearold youth had both arms amputated below 
the elbow 
insignia on shirt buttons the only clue to nationality 
identified 22 of the skeletons as those of american soldiers their 
remains will be buried june 30 at bath national cemetery in new 
york state with full military honors 
six more of the skeltons are suspected to be slain american 
soldiers the others will be studied further at the university of 
tennessee 
the skeletons were found last fall at snake hill a strategic 
mound of earth on the canadian side of the niagara river where 
occupying us forces established a battery and a field hospital in 
1814 in their war against britain the site overlooks buffalo ny

western hotels heightened security today and 
children were told not to talk to strangers because of a warning 
from the us embassy that americans may become targets of 
terrorist attacks 
we are on the alert for all unusual occurrences and have added 
a few more people to our security staff said max wilhelm 
manager of the sheraton great wall hotel but its hard to say 
where to look and what to look for 
the embassy sent out an urgent notice to american citizens 
thursday saying chinese authorities told the embassy nationals 
of a third country may be planning a terrorist attack on americans 
in beijing 
embassy officials in beijing said the chinese reported there was 
middle east involvement but provided no details they said 
highlevel chinese public security officers informed the embassy of 
the threat on wednesday 
there are approximately 1500 american businessmen diplomats 
students teachers and their families in beijing 
scott chambers principal of the international school of 
beijing said the school blocked off the road leading to the school 
building locked the back doors and notified security officers to 
increase their vigilance 
our security perimeter is pretty vulnerable he said 
chambers said children were told of the warning at a morning 
assembly and that teachers will stress to their students not to 
talk to strangers 
were trying to keep it below the panic stage its a fine 
line he said the school is supported by the governments of the 
united states britain australia canada and new zealand 
embassy officials said they were taking ordinary precautions and 
few signs emerged of an increase in already tight security around 
embassy buildings 
solitary chinese guards continued to man posts outside the 
buildings and as usual young chinese hoping to receive a visa to 
go to the united states milled around the outside of the consular 
affairs building 
the embassy on thursday circulated to staff members and some 
american business people a 15point list of security tips it 
advised people to vary their activities and travel routes avoid 
wearing clothes and carrying bags which identify one as an 
american and stay away from restaurants and bars which are popular 
hangouts for americans 
dont be embarrassed or afraid to seek help if you note 
unusual activity or believe you are being followed it said 
it urged people to be alert and dont daydream while traveling 
to and from work 
the notice sent out to american residents said the embassy 
believes that this warning reflects a genuine threat and that 
american citizens in the beijing area should take appropriate steps 
to protect themselves 
it recommended that people steer clear of popular gathering 
points and asked that suspicious activity be reported to the 
embassy immediately 
the notice also went to americans in the port city of tianjin 
60 miles to the southeast 
embassy spokeswoman sylvia rifkin said the us mission in 
beijing sent out warnings before to americans based on worldwide 
alerts against terrorists but this was the first time the warning 
specifically concerned china 
no past incidents have arisen of terrorist attacks in china 
against chinese or foreign residents china also has good relations 
with mideast nations which have been accused of fostering terrorist 
activities 
china deals harshly with chinese caught stealing or committing 
other crimes against foreigners and foreigners in beijing and 
other cities generally have little concern over their personal 
safety 
im bewildered like everyone else said an american lawyer 
when asked how she planned to respond to the terrorist threat

a media watchdog group says mighty mouse 
is teaching the nations children to sniff cocaine but cbs says 
such accusations against its longtime cartoon hero are ridiculous 
mighty mouse is down in the dumps and he reaches in his cape 
pulls out a substance and sniffs it through his nostrils and from 
that point on in the cartoon he is his normal self said the rev 
donald wildmon who heads the tupelobased american family 
association 
wildmon claimed thursday that mighty mouse used cocaine during 
the cartoons april 23 episode cbs and the cartoons producer 
ralph bakshi says thats hogwash 
the whole affair smacks of burning books and the third reich 
it smacks of mccarthyism im not going to get into who sniffs 
what bakshi said this is lunacy 
wildmons organization has sponsored boycotts and other 
activities against businesses that sponsor what it sees as too much 
sex and violence on television and in magazines 
wildmon is seeking the resignations of bakshi an animator best 
known for the risque fritz the cat cartoons in the 1970s and 
judy parker cbs televisions vice president for childrens 
programming he said they attempted to cover up what was aired on 
april 23 
mr bakshi told reporters from detroit after calling me all 
kinds of names that mighty mouse was sniffing crushed flowers 
he said 
we had a state narcotics officer and a university professor 
both experts to view the scene in question and they were convinced 
it was cocaine wildmon said 
cbs on thursday released a twopage letter to wildmon from 
george dessard the networks vice president of program practices 
in which he accused the methodist minister of taking three 
seconds of air time out of context and made it the subject of 
a fanciful and irresponsible misrepresentation 
dessard said the substance was clearly crushed flowers he said 
that in the episode in question the littlest tramp the 
principal story line revolves around mighty mouses efforts to 
assist polly a poor but industrious flower seller 
in the cartoon the villain repeatedly destroys pollys flowers 
and she is forced to make substitute flowers using fallen leaves 
strawberries and even wedges of overripened tomatoes 
he said mighty mouse is shown collecting and saving the fake 
flowers and later when a speaker at a serviceoriented lodge 
meeting of ants talks of wanting to help those less fortunate 
mighty mouse announces that phrase reminds him of someone else 
and pulls out a pink mass of crushed stems tomatoes and flowers 
which he holds out as if to show them 
we see the aroma reach his nose in typical cartoon fashion as 
the scene changes to another story event dessard said there 
is no powder he is neither shown to be nor described as 
rejected or down in the dumps before he brings out the remains of 
the flowers

reindeer featured in the movies climactic scene suddenly shed 
their antlers en masse 
there was nothing you could do about it writer and unit 
director coke sams said as the films final scenes were being shot 
this week at berry field 
you couldnt yell at them you couldnt offer them more money 
they had molted he said 
the deer provided by steve martins working wildlife in los 
angeles were flown in from california and oregon up to six weeks 
ago to appear in the emshell producers group inc motion picture 
the deer sported lovely antlers right up until the moment their 
cue was called 
we talked about prosthetic antlers sams said the problem 
is when the antlers fall off there are these little bloody stumps 
theyre real touchy about 
styrofoam antlers were made for silhouette shots but didnt 
work for scenes in which the reindeers were to pull a sleigh 
through the sky 
the only alternative was to put the deer out to pasture along 
with everybody else until the problem solved itself 
they grew their little horns back varney said as the 
animals trotted out this week in full regalia at last

a bulgarian helped two soviet cosmonauts guide 
their capsule toward a docking with the soviet space station mir 
and prepared for the busiest program of experiments of any soviet 
space flight involving a foreigner 
alexander alexandrov a 36yearold cosmonaut from the bulgarian 
town of omurtag will help the soviets perform more than 40 
medical metallurgical astronomical and geological studies on mir 
russian for peace 
todays schedule calls for the crew to conduct vision 
experiments in the weightlessness of space activate a 
bulgarianmade device to study the stars and other distant objects 
try mixing metals and look for natural resources in bulgaria 
live blackandwhite video broadcast on staterun soviet and 
bulgarian television thursday showed the mir complex with its 
three solar battery panels shaped like an upsidedown letter t 
getting bigger and bigger as the soyuz tm5 capsule approached 
docking occurred shortly before 8 pm 
about 90 minutes later soviet television broke into its evening 
news program vremya for a live color broadcast showing 
alexandrov wearing a dark blue flight suit aboard mir with four 
soviet cosmonauts 
among those shown applauding the docking at the soviet mission 
control center in kaliningrad northeast of moscow was georgy 
ivanov a bulgarian who along with a soviet cosmonaut failed in 
april 1979 to link a soyuz33 capsule with the soviet space station 
salyut6 
alexandrov was the backup bulgarian cosmonaut for the 1979 
mission and began training last year for the current mission which 
is scheduled to end june 17 he and soviet cosmonauts viktor p 
savinykh and anatoly y solovyov blasted off tuesday from the 
baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia 
aboard mir the three are guests of soviet cosmonauts vladimir 
titov and musa manarov who boarded the space station dec 23 
if the cosmonauts have any spare time mission controls 
planning director boris a sirotkin told reporters they can listen 
to music tapes watch movies on videotape or read books and 
newspapers 
the 1979 docking failed because a maneuvering engine aboard the 
soyuz33 malfunctioned the docking was aborted 
the soviet labor newspaper trud said wednesday that the 
cosmonauts aboard the capsule could have become prisoners in 
orbit because the same engine would have to be used to return to 
earth a backup engine also didnt work properly but it was able 
to return the cosmonauts safely 
soviet reports on the current mission have emphasized that the 
soyuz capsules propulsion systems have been improved since the 
1979 failure 
two other soviet space missions with foreigners are planned 
later this year with astronauts from france and afghanistan 
the mir station has been aloft since february 1986 it is the 
base to which several scientific modules supply craft and 
cosmonaut transport craft have been attached soviet officials say 
it will be manned permanently

the guardian angels have begun patrolling chic 
restaurant row in manhattans theater district where restaurateurs 
blame the crack trade and inadequate police protection for a drop 
in business 
the 30 guardian angels unarmed teenage volunteers who patrol 
neighborhoods and subways were given a closed french restaurant to 
use as their headquarters and promises of meals from 15 fashionable 
cafes on west 46th street between eighth and ninth avenues 
theyre not even fully operational yet but you can feel the 
difference joe allen owner of a restaurant bearing his name 
said recently people are smiling again old people are coming 
out of their homes without feeling in danger and tourists can cross 
eighth avenue without fear 
eighth avenue has a history of drug dealing and prostitution 
but the arrival of crack has altered everything making the 
problem much more pervasive and dangerous allen said 
some restaurant owners estimated business had dropped off 20 
percent in recent months 
restaurateurs said the police presence has dropped as crime has 
risen 
police spokesman sgt edward burns said there had been a 
decrease in the number of officers at the precinct in the past six 
months as there had in all precincts 
however burns said in the threeblock area around restaurant 
row police made 600 arrests last year and 600 already this year 
the highest figures for any section of the city 
since their founding in 1979 the guardian angels have expanded 
into a nationwide group drawing both strong praise and criticism

an experimental vaccine may act as a 
contraceptive for as long as six months without serious side 
effects according to a preliminary study of 30 women 
in the study the vaccine created blood proteins or antibodies 
in the women that attacked a key hormone required for pregnancy 
researchers said 
the effectiveness of the proteins could not be tested directly 
because the test subjects had already been surgically sterilized 
but the level of proteins appeared to be high enough to block 
pregnancy researchers said 
no significant side effects appeared in the women studied said 
the scientists from australia ohio state university and the world 
health organization in geneva switzerland the study appears in 
saturdays issue of the lancet a british medical journal 
several groups are also studying vaccines similar to the one 
used in the new study said gabriel bialy chief of the 
contraceptive development branch of the national institute of child 
health and human development 
some foreign governments have approved use of matchstick sized 
capsules that are implanted just under the skin of a womans arm 
under local anesthetic by slowly releasing a drug they provide 
contraception for five years unless removed sooner 
a variety of strategies is needed to allow choices in birth 
control bialy said 
the vaccine was designed to spur the immune system into making 
antibodies that attack a hormone called human chorionic 
gonadotropin which is produced during pregnancy 
animal studies had shown that an antibody attack on this hormone 
can halt pregnancy at an early stage researchers wrote 
scientists are not sure whether the attack prevents the 
blastocyst a clump of cells that grows from a fertilized egg from 
implanting itself in the uterus wall or whether it prevents 
further development soon after implantation bialy said 
implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the 
egg is fertilized 
the study focused on 30 women ages 26 to 43 twenty received 
one of five dosage levels of the vaccine and the rest a placebo 
injection each received two injections six weeks apart in the 
buttocks they were studied for six months after the first 
injection 
all vaccinated women showed antibody levels that apparently 
would be high enough to block pregnancy researchers said 
on average the four women who got the highest dose exceeded the 
critical antibody level by the fifth week after the first 
injection and stayed above that level after six months two women 
remained at or above the level for nine and 10 months researchers 
said 
women who received lesser doses reached the critical level about 
six weeks on average after the first injection which was at the 
time of the second injection and stayed there almost six months 
no participants showed any serious side effects researchers 
said several in the highestdose group had mild and temporary 
muscle pain within two days of the injection 
twentyfive of the 30 women reported no change in their 
menstrual patterns of the remaining five one who had received a 
placebo reported an early menopause three who received the vaccine 
had slight bleeding called spotting between periods and one 
reported excessive menstrual bleeding

tens of thousands of armenians have been marching 
daily through a southern city and have shut down most businesses 
and public transportation pravda said today in an update on the 
countrys severest ethnic dispute 
the communist party newspaper said the unrest in 
nagornokarabakh an autonomous region of the republic of 
azerbaijan has cost the government 411 million since it began in 
february 
pravda said a general strike in the area has lasted for three 
weeks 
such an unusual and unexpected word for us the newspaper 
said 
the soviets used to say strikes were a purely western phenomenon 
that were anathema to their socialist system of rule by the working 
class but strikes have become a frequent way for armenians to 
press their demand that nagornokarabakh be taken away from 
azerbaijan and made part of the neighboring armenian republic 
pravda admitted the central soviet press had been ignoring the 
story in nagornokarabakh since february when the unrest began 
but that in the meantime tension in the region did not subside 
it said it was providing an update because readers had written 
letters asking if the situation had improved 
residents of the area and moscowbased dissidents have been 
reporting the latest wave of unrest to western journalists but the 
soviet press carried nothing on the situation until today 
pravda said strikes that began may 23 had shut down the majority 
of industrial enterprises and mass transit in stepanakert the main 
city of nagornokarabakh whose population of 160000 is mostly 
armenian 
also affected were three regional centers within 
nagornokarabakh martunin mardakert and askeran nearly all 
cafeterias and stores are also closed according to pravda 
every morning tens of thousands of people move sidebyside 
in columns along streets toward the center of the city with banners 
and signs conducting meetings the newspaper reported 
armenians have set up selfdefense posts around the clock to 
prevent attacks by azeris the main national group in azerbaijan 
pravda said such measures are unnecessary because there havent 
been any attacks it said 
but it said armenians have been mixing rumors and facts about 
what happened in the azerbaijani city of sumgait and that this has 
led to unwarranted fear 
azeris went on a rampage at the end of february in sumgait and 
32 people mostly armenians were killed 
pravda disclosed that azeris staged counterdemonstrations 
rejecting the territorial demand may 1415 in the republics 
capital baku and other azerbaijani cities 
the newspaper blamed nagornokarabakhs party officials for not 
ending the strike 
the partys top official in the region boris kevorkov was 
fired feb 24 and kicked out of the party altogether in late may 
for negligence that soviet media said exacerbated the ethnic 
conflict 
demonstrations also have been taking place in yereven the 
capital of armenia armenians mostly students began a sitin 
outside the citys opera theater on may 25 they want the 
parliament of armenia the supreme soviet to consider their demand 
at a june 15 meeting 
armenian residents of nagornokarabakh have complained of poor 
cultural and social services and discrimiation by azeris and say 
the area is part of their ancestral homeland armenians are 
predominantly christian while most azeris are moslem 
the central government has rejected the demand to give 
nagornokarabakh to armenia and instead ordered improvements in 
living conditions for its residents

president corazon aquino signed a 
land reform bill today and said she hoped the measure would uplift 
millions of rural filipinos from their ancient poverty 
she congratulated congress for enacting the legislation after 
nearly a year of debate and said the measure would contribute to 
the true independence of the filipino people 
the bill approved by congress last wednesday gives landowners 
the choice of dividing their property among tenants or sharing 
profits with them 
it is expected to benefit two million landless farmers in this 
largely agricultural nation of 7100 islands land reform is 
considered essential to defeating the 19year communist insurgency 
which draws its support primarily from rural areas 
few measures have been as rigorously scrutinized and discussed 
as this program has been by representatives of the people and by 
the people themselves mrs aquino told a national television 
audience after signing the measure 
i should hope that now the various interests in the land will 
be able to work together to achieve the twin goals of the program 
a radical leap in agricultural productivity and therefore a 
significant contribution by the agricultural sector to philippine 
progress and the upliftment of the filipino masses from their 
ancient poverty 
under the plan each landowner may retain 12 acres and an 
additional seven acres for each direct heir over age 15 who will 
till the land a landowner has the option of sharing profits or 
giving workers shares of stock instead of physically dividing the 
property 
let us see the program not as a taking of property from some 
and a giving of it to others but rather as a way of liberating the 
hitherto suppressed energies and creativity of the nation for the 
material upliftment of the many and prosperity of all she added 
leftist farm groups have branded the plan a grand deception 
because they claim it does not go far enough in breaking up huge 
estates and redistributing property to the landless 
rep bonifacio gillego who sponsored the bill in the house but 
voted against the measure after amendments claimed the law would 
bring about agrarian reform through a revolution 
he predicted communist rebels would seek to undermine the 
program by trying to convince rural filipinos that it was a sham 
other critics said the success of the plan will depend on the 
governments success in providing credits expertise and other 
support to new landowners 
the main responsibility for the implementation of the program 
lies with the department of agrarian reform mrs aquino said 
but i expect all the other departments the entire apparatus of 
government civil and military to be as deeply involved and as 
committed to its success 
the law also provides for the distribution to farm workers of 
tracts of public land greater than 2470 acres now leased to 
multinational corporations 
government lands will be the first distributed in the 10year 
program private holdings of more than 1235 acres will be 
parcelled out in the first four years and smaller holdings later 
owners of more than 1235 acres will be paid 25 percent of the 
value in cash and those with less than 60 acres will be paid 35 
percent in cash tax exemptions shares of stock in governmentrun 
corporations or land bank of the philippines bonds will make up the 
rest of the compensation 
officials say the program estimated to cost 70 billion will 
be financed by foreign aid and assets of exiled former president 
ferdinand marcos and his associates that were seized on grounds 
they were illegally acquired 
marcos ruled the philippines for 20 years and was driven from 
the country by a civilianbacked military uprising that swept mrs 
aquino to power in february 1986 
the philippines attempted about a dozen land reform programs in 
the past but they failed either for lack of funds or resistance 
from landowners 
land reform was among the demands of prosoviet huk rebels in 
the 1950s and early 1960s and is a major demand of communist rebels 
in the current insurgency which began in 1968

brian sullivan finished his 42day 800mile 
hike from chicago to philadelphia in a steady rain he did it on 
two pairs of running shoes almost 30 spaghetti dinners and one 
kidney 
his brother kevin has the other one 
the two wet men followed by relatives and wellwishers walked 
with their arms around each other thursday to the philadelphia 
hospital where nearly four years ago brian donated the kidney that 
saved his brothers life 
brian a 31yearold recreation supervisor from carol stream 
ill walked most of the distance by himself to emphasize the need 
for organ donation and demonstrate that he has suffered no ill 
effects from donating one of his kidneys 
you dont have to do something this stupid or crazy 
obviously but its nice to know if you wanted to you could he 
said 
his brother kevin 36 developed kidney failure in 1984 and 
needed a transplant two brothers and a sister were eligible 
donors but after a family discussion it was decided that brian was 
in the best shape to give a kidney 
the experience taught him that organs of all types are in scarce 
supply whether they come from living or dead donors 
he decided on the walk as a way to bring attention to the 
importance of organ donation and set a goal of signing up 100000 
people to organ donor cards brian said he has personally signed as 
a witness on 561 donor cards during the walk 
he and officials with organ donor networks estimate he spoke to 
more than 10000 people during the trip and that many more were 
reached through the publicity surrounding the walk 
brian who began the trip on april 24 in chicago averaged about 
20 miles a day walking from chicago through indiana to cleveland 
through the mountains of pennsylvania to philadelphia 
on thursday he wended his way through downtown philadelphia to 
thomas jefferson university hospital where the transplant was 
performed a crowd of about 30 hospital staff members and 
transplant recipients waited to welcome him 
its really unbelievable i find it hard to believe god did 
six weeks go by he said 
brian insisted that the trip proved there are no physical 
limitations for donors he did drop 12 pounds from of his 
5foot11inch frame though he remains solid at 198 pounds due in

the border about 5000 bottled up by police in yonsei university 
tried to force their way out 
we fight for unification students chanted as they tried to 
break through police lines to make their way to the border 30 miles 
north of seoul 
police hit by firebombs screamed with pain as they were 
enveloped in orange flames in the fighting around yonsei students 
wielding wooden and iron clubs beat troopers trying to ward off 
blows with shields both sides pelted each other with rocks and 
bricks 
black police armored cars fired volley after volley of choking 
tear gas into the charging students and police martial arts squads 
counterattacked students tried to immobilize the vans with 
firebombs and clubs 
police arrested more than 500 students in various parts of 
seoul and about 40 students who managed to reach imjingak at the 
edge of the demilitarized zone along the border were immediately 
detained 
police battled several thousand students who held demonstrations 
to support the reunification march in the provincial cities of 
taejon iri chunju chonan and kongju troopers fired tear gas to 
drive protesters back into college campuses as students hurled 
firebombs and rocks 
protesters at one point dragged a 20foot baseball backstop to 
the main gate at yonsei to deflect exploding gas bombs fired by 
police but riot troopers attacked and dragged it away 
dozens were injured at the university but authorities had no 
overall figures police officers and students with burns or blood 
pouring from cuts were carried away or staggered to safety a 
student hit in the head by a teargas shell was in critical 
condition 
radical students called for the march to force reunification of 
the communist north and the prowestern south radicals claim the 
united states enforces partition of the korean peninsula to rule 
the south and the protests were vehemently antiamerican 
yankee go home and skin the yankees screamed the 
students 
about 60000 riot police in green combat fatigues and helmets 
were deployed in seoul and on roads leading to the border to block 
the march banned by the government as a national security risk 
police guarded train and bus stations to stop students from 
slipping through to the border riot squads ringed government 
buildings and us diplomatic facilities to prevent attacks 
riot squads seized dozens of students in clashes around the 
railway station some students hurled rocks but most did not fight 
back as charging police roughly scattered marchers 
officers were seen brutally punching and kicking students as 
they dragged them away blood poured from faces of beaten students 
pedestrians ran for cover or choked and coughed from swirling 
tear gas the running clashes repeatedly brought traffic to a 
standstill on many main streets 
fighting erupted around yonsei today when students attempted to 
march out after a rally at which speakers called for reunification 
and denounced the united states a giant picture of an enraged 
student slashing a us flag was used as a backdrop

dictatorship a speaker shouted as cheering students waved red 
blue and black antigovernment and antius banners

troopers other students in nearby sidestreets tried to attack 
police from the rear and seized several high rooftops 
radical leaders said two representatives were sent to slip past 
police blocks and reach the border truce site of panmunjom to meet 
with the northern delegates the heavilymilitarized border is off 
limits to all civilians 
the north korean government korean central news agency said in a 
report monitored in tokyo that the norths delegates and many 
students had reached panmunjom and were waiting the delegates 
would be government appointees 
the student delegation from our side is now waiting for the 
moment when it will have an emotioncharged meeting with fellow 
students from the south the report said 
most south koreans oppose the radicals reunification drive 
people fear the totalitarian north is as determined to conquer the 
south as it was when it invaded in 1950 to start the korean war 
the radicals a small but powerful minority on campuses claim 
reunfication overrides any ideological considerations radicals 
demand expulsion of the 42000 us troops based in the south under 
a mutual defense treaty 
the south korean government says the radicals are procommunist 
or idealists who risk being used by the north it insists it alone 
should handle contacts with the north and the mainline opposition 
parties opposed the student march

three inmates who shot a guard while 
escaping from a maximumsecurity prison may have fled to the united 
states after releasing their two hostages provincial authorities 
said 
the escapees two of whom were believed to be wounded in a gun 
battle with guards commandeered a car thursday outside the laval 
institute a prison north of montreal 
they took both its driver and a guard with them the guard 
therese gagne and the motorist an unidentified middleaged woman 
were found unharmed three hours later at a farmhouse about 20 miles 
from the prison they phoned police from candiac about 30 miles 
from the new york state border 
constable andre blanchette a provincial police spokesman said 
the two women reported that one of the convicts was shot in the 
elbow and another in the shoulder 
paul fournier assistant director of the institute said the 
injured prison guard pierre blouin was shot in the shoulder and 
leg but was expected to survive 
the escapees were identified as rene starnaud 26 serving 12 
years for armed robbery his brother pierre 24 serving seven 
years for robbery and robert henley 29 serving life for murder 
the elder starnaud has a large spider web tattooed on his 
forehead blanchette said 
they could be anywhere including the united states he said 
the breakout began about 1030 am as gagne was returning to 
her post after checking a disturbance in one of four workshops she 
guards from a tower fournier and pierre chapleau an official with 
the guards union said the three prisoners overpowered her

researchers say theyre encouraged by animal 
tests of a genetically engineered human hormone for treating one of 
the more common forms of infertility in women 
it does everything we want it to do so far said dr james 
simon one of four authors of a study in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
the hormone produced by recombinant genesplicing technology 
is called rechlh and is biologically identical to the substance 
produced by a womans pituitary gland to induce ovulation called a 
luteinizing hormone or lh 
in primate testing rechlh initiated ovulation it helped 
stimulate normal hormonal production through the entire menstrual 
cycle the eggs were fertile and the monkeys produced embryos 
simon said 
but until we try it in humans we cant be sure all the 
advantages are real said simon who is director of the 
reproductive endocrinology and infertility services at the 
georgetown university school of medicine 
serono laboratories inc the worldwide pharmaceutical concern 
that is developing rechlh estimates it could be seven to nine 
years before the product is clinically tested on humans approved 
by the food and drug administration and put on the market 
one of the more common causes of infertility in women is 
hormonal abnormalities that prevent a woman from regularly 
producing fertile eggs 
the hormonal abnormalities in turn can frequently be traced to 
a womans inability to produce either lh or another hormone called 
a folliclestimulating hormone fsh in the proper sequence and 
ratio 
supplies of both fsh and lh used to treat infertility are now 
extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women 
sources of pure fsh which causes follicles in the ovary to grow 
and mature prior to the start of ovulation have been available 
commercially for about a year 
prior to development of rechlh no source of pure lh existed 
the delicate balance between the two hormones is what makes up 
a menstrual cycle and getting both together limited our ability to 
mimic the normal pituitary processes simon said by having a 
pure source of lh we can add it back in such a way to tailor the 
relationship to each individual we treat 
and that says nothing about the obvious advantages of 
availability and consistency of production we can maintain by being 
able to produce rechlh through genetic engineering simon said 
lh also is involved in sperm production and rechlh may help 
battle sterility in men as well said simon though its potential 
application for males now is much less understood by researchers

a newspaper today said indias 
intelligence service tried to overthrow fijis melanesiandominated 
government by smuggling tons of weapons to its indian community 
the report in the australian drew a quick denial from australian 
prime minister bob hawke who said he would have known of such 
shipments the indian embassy in canberra also issued a vigorous 
denial 
the australian the countrys only national broadsheet said in 
its leading story that western intelligence services blamed the 
indian government for recent arms shipments to the volatile south 
pacific nation of fiji a former british colony 1860 miles 
northeast of sydney 
it said the sovietmade arms which included rockets launchers 
antitank mines automatic rifles and grenades were part of a plan 
to overthrow the nominally civilian melanesiandominated 
government which came to power after two coups last year 
the newspaper quoted australian intelligence sources and a us 
government official in washington it did not identify them 
fijis security forces this week seized two large caches of arms 
from two indianowned sugar cane farms authorities followed with a 
roundup of indian businessmen 
on thursday police detained two former cabinet ministers in the 
ousted indiandominated government of timoci bavadra 
bavadras government was overthrown by lt col sitiveni rabuka 
one month after it was elected rabuka said he mounted the may 14 
1987 coup to protect political rights of ethnic fijians who are 
outnumbered by indians in the 715000 population rabuka carried 
out a second coup four months later citing the same reason 
rabuka has since handed power to the nominally civilian 
government and appointed himself head of the army and home affairs 
minister in charge of internal security 
he has said the arms shipments were part of a foreign plot to 
destabilize the nation but he did not specifically accuse any 
particular group

a federal appeals court decision to 
reconsider a landmark ruling striking down the armys ban on 
homosexual soldiers was a setback but not a reason to despair says 
a homosexualrights groups lawyer 
the struggle for equal rights for lesbians and gay men is a 
longterm struggle leonard graff legal director of national gay 
rights advocates said following thursdays decision 
realistically we have to expect some setbacks that doesnt mean 
we give up 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals agreed to reconsider a 
feb 10 ruling in the case of a discharged soldier from the seattle 
area 
a panel of the court ruled 21 at the time that 1981 army 
regulations providing for discharge on the grounds of homosexual 
orientation were unconstitutional 
the panel had said homosexuals as victims of historic 
mistreatment deserved the same protections from discrimination as 
racial minorities it was the first time an appellate court reached 
that conclusion 
the latest ruling which granted a reagan administration request 
that the case be referred to an 11member panel for a new hearing 
cancelled the earlier orders legal effect 
the 25judge appeals court gave no reason for its decision or 
details of its vote no date has been set for the new hearing 
the government had contended the ruling failed to defer to the 
armys judgment in matters of discipline and morale and also was 
inconsistent with the supreme courts 1986 ruling upholding an 
antisodomy law in georgia 
a lawyer for perry watkins the former solider said he was not 
surprised by the decision and expected the case to end up in the 
supreme court if he wins the next round 
thats why i did not advise homosexual members of the army 
after the february decision to come out of the closet and say 
here i am you cant touch me said attorney james lobsenz 
watkins now 39 enlisted in the army in 1967 at age 19 
admitting at the time that he had homosexual tendencies the man 
who had been supervisor of the fort lewis personnel administration 
center and had high job ratings was discharged in may 1984 
before 1981 the army discharged soldiers for sodomy and other 
specific acts but not for homosexuality itself but that year 
homosexual orientation was declared to be grounds for discharge 
nearly 1400 people were discharged from all branches of the 
armed services for homosexuality in the fiscal year that ended last 
sept 30 the government said 
in the feb 10 ruling the threejudge panel said the army must 
reconsider watkins application for reenlistment without regard to 
his sexual orientation 
writing for the majority judge william norris likened laws 
limiting the acceptable focus of sexual desire to members of 
the opposite sex to laws limiting the choice of a spouse or sex 
partner to members of the same race such laws he said are 
unconstitutional discrimination in the absence of compelling 
governmental justification 
norris rejected army arguments that the ban was justified by 
widely shared moral standards and by military morale and 
discipline the claim that homosexuals would hurt morale and 
discipline was an attempt to illegitimately cater to private 
biases he said

colossus is getting a gorilla 
girlfriend 
muke pronouced mookey will be the first member of his 
species that colossus billed as the largest lowland gorilla in 
captivity will have seen since infancy when she arrives next 
wednesday at the zoo 
hopefully shes good looking said pat quinn director of 
the zoo id hate to have him mad at me for the rest of his 
life 
muke will be on breeding loan from the st louis zoo 
colossus 62 and more than 550 pounds took his first step 
outside in about 20 years march 18 when zoo officials allowed him 
to explore a spacious outdoor habitat 
colossus was moved to the zoo outside this pensacola suburb from 
bensons animal park in hudson nh where he had been kept in a 
small indoor cage since his capture in west africa 
a prior effort to produce offspring from colossus through 
artificial insemination failed just before his move to florida 
because the huge ape wasnt very sexually active quinn said 
colossus has shown signs of more sexual interest at his new home 
and hopes the introduction of a female will heighten his fervor 
to prepare for his first glimpse of another gorilla scientists 
from the university of west florida have been showing him national 
geographic videotapes of gorillas 
he did respond quinn said he was most interested in 
gorillas that interacted with humans because thats what he is used 
to 
a young male chimpanzee has been placed in a room adjoining that 
of colossus in the zoos gorilla house to get the huge ape used to 
the idea of having someone next door 
muke will replace the chimp at first they will be allowed only 
to look at and smell each other later a door between the two 
rooms will be opened wide enough so they can touch and finally 
wide enough so the female can enter colossus room 
the match was arranged by the gorilla species survival plan 
committee of the american association of zoos and aquariums 
gorillas are an endangered species and colossus is seen as 
particularly attractive for breeding because he was captured in the 
wild and will introduce new genes into the community of captive 
apes 
even if they fail to mate muke would have accomplished one goal 
if she can get him to socialize with another member of the species 
in the wild dominant male gorillas dont have a single mate but 
preside over veritable harems

will be given amnesty if they renounce membership in secret 
societies

blood oaths and financed their operations with extortion murder 
robbery narcotics kidnappings and prostitution

two of irans top leaders conferred with 
the designated successor to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 
official news agency said today a western television network 
reported that the ailing patriarch may be dying 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani conferred wednesday with 
ayatollah husseinali montazeri in the holy city of qom 100 miles 
south of tehran the agency said that president ali khamenei also 
saw montazeri in qom on thursday 
in both cases the agency said the two political leaders 
discussed current issues but it did not elaborate 
rafsanjani and khamenei are political rivals in the power 
struggle that has been taking place in the tehran hierarchy over 
who will run the country when khomeini dies 
the 87yearold revolutionary patriarch has been reported in 
frail health since he suffered a heart attack two years ago there 
have also been unconfirmed reports that he has cancer 
irans official media have made no recent reference to 
khomeinis health 
the cbs television network reported thursday that intelligence 
reports indicated khomeini may now be very close to death 
it quoted the reports as saying that the ayatollahs cancer 
has spread from his prostate to his liver and that he may only 
have two or three months to live 
it also reported that us intelligence officials say montazeri 
would succeed khomeini but the real power would be wielded by 
rafsanjani 
speculation that the iranian leaders condition was 
deteriorating heightened when he appointed rafsanjani also one of 
his closest aides as acting commanderinchief of irans armed 
forces on june 2 
khomeini had held that title under irans revolutionary 
constitution 
his appointment of rafsanjani followed two recent battlefield 
defeats that iran suffered in its nearly 8yearold war with iraq 
khomeini who last week declared the war would be won on the 
battlefield and not at the negotiating table ordered rafsanjani to 
reorganize irans fractious military forces 
tehran radio also monitored in nicosia quoted rafsanjani as 
saying june 3 that it was no longer possible for khomeini to 
personally run the administrative affairs of irans various 
military forces 
he did not elaborate but added we should not have such 
expectations of his holiness 
rafsanjani a 53yearold cleric has long been considered the 
second most powerful figure in iran after khomeini 
he consolidated his political power with the appointment as 
military chief and his june 7 reelection as speaker by the majlis 
or parliament 
he also represents khomeini on the supreme defense council 
which determines irans war strategy maintains close links with 
the revolutionary guards and sits on several key committees 
although khomeini clearly indicated in 1985 that 65yearold 
montazeri would succeed him he drew up a new political testament 
on dec 10 
tehran radio said it contained some changes from an earlier 
document khomeini had written to be opened after his death the 
contents were not disclosed 
montazeri has been opposed by several iranian leaders including 
rafsanjani he also lacks the charisma and authority of khomeini 
khomeini was last seen in public may 13 accompanied by his son 
ahmed the national leader has rarely left his residence in the 
last few years 
when the parliament reconvened may 28 his son read a speech in 
the house on behalf of his father there was no official 
explanation of khomeinis absence

people who make money by making babies 
could be put behind bars under a bill approved by the michigan 
legislature 
legislation outlawing pregnancyforpay contracts was approved 
thursday on a 9010 house vote and 283 senate vote 
after five years in probably the state that was most 
difficult to pass a surrogate act its a real victory said 
republican sen connie binsfeld the bills sponsor 
the bill goes to gov james blanchard who will have 14 days to 
veto sign or let it automatically become law blanchards chief 
lobbyist william kandler said he didnt know what blanchard would 
do 
michigan is an important target for surrogacy opponents because 
it is home to one of the nations most prolific surrogacy 
matchmakers lawyer noel keane of dearborn says he has arranged 
more than 200 births including the mary beth whitehead pregnancy 
that led to new jerseys landmark baby m case in that case 
the state supreme court outlawed surrogacy for pay 
keane maintains those cases are the rare exception and that most 
people involved in surrogate arrangements are very happy with the 
results 
typically an infertile couple pays keane 10000 to match them 
with a woman willing to be artificially inseminated carry a child 
to term and give up her parental rights the woman also is paid 
10000 
under the proposed michigan law no such payments could change 
hands although a woman who entered into an unenforceable surrogacy 
agreement could be compensated for her expenses 
brokers who arrange surrogate births for profit would face 
felony penalties of up to five years in prison and a 50000 fine 
people who enter into such contracts would face misdemeanor charges 
punishable by up to a year and 10000 
binsfeld said the bill also would ban a contracting couple from 
giving such women any gifts 
women still could become surrogates for free for example if a 
sister wanted to carry a child for her infertile sibling 
the legislation would guarantee that in the case of a surrogacy 
custody dispute the baby would remain with its mother until a 
circuit judge determined whether it was in the childs best 
interest to give custody to the father 
binsfeld called the measure the only answer to protect 
children 
i dont think adults should be able to fulfill their desires 
at the expense of children she said 
lawmakers who voted against the bill said the legislature 
probably hasnt settled anything 
surrogacy is not going to end it may be forced 
underground said democratic rep floyd clack who predicted 
lawmakers within the next two years will be asked to come up with 
different regulations 
women who become surrogate mothers are entitled to be paid for 
their services just like male athletes who risk their bodies are 
paid said republican rep david honigman head of a special 
committee that examined the issue 
honigman agreed that people who want a standard surrogate 
arrangement will be able to enter one most people are going to 
go out of state of course he said 
kentucky louisiana and nebraska have enacted laws declaring 
surrogate arrangements illegal indiana put enforcement of 
surrogate contracts on hold until the issue can be researched and 
proposed surrogacy regulations were vetoed in arkansas according 
to the national conference of state legislatures

about 1000 students marched from beijing university to central 
beijings tiananmen square to demonstrate their sorrow and anger 
and demand better security for students 
the high emotions quickly switched channel however and in the 
next few days students put up dozens of posters attacking 
government corruption and demanding democracy and greater press 
freedom 
the unrest peaked wednesday when police sealed off tiananmen 
square and intimidated the students into canceling plans for a 
prodemocracy march 
the mood on beijing university campus was subdued today with 
fewer and fewer students crowding around the weathertattered 
posters that advocated protest 
about 850 students gathered late thursday night near the 
bulletin boards for an impromptu rally but only half a dozen 
students stepped forward to speak and their message was restrained 
we students talk about democracy but we dont understand it 
ourselves so how can we preach it to society one asked 
eliciting applause 
another said we students and the government leaders are not 
at odds our goals are the same we are all chinese 
no one suggested further protest and the rally broke up shortly 
after midnight by contrast hundreds of students rallied until 1 
and 2 am each night earlier in the week cheering speakers who 
suggested that they boycott classes hold protest marches and take 
over the campus radio station none of the suggestions were acted 
on 
by sealing off tiananmen square on wednesday the government 
made it clear it would not tolerate a repeat of the massive student 
prodemocracy protests that took place in the winter of 198687 
those protests ended with a conservative crackdown including the 
ouster of relatively liberal communist party chief hu yaobang

nato foreign ministers today called for 
early negotiations to reduce troops in europe and promised to 
consider a more equitable sharing of defense costs between the 
united states and its allies 
in a joint declaration the 16 foreign ministers said successful 
negotiations with the soviet bloc depended on substantial and 
balanced results on human rights 
the statement issued at the end of natos spring meeting 
attempted to prod the soviets to improve their human rights record 
before the north atlantic treaty organization would undertake 
negotiations with the warsaw pact 
the goal the statment said was a substantial and balanced 
reduction of nonnuclear forces in europe 
negotiations dealing only with troop reductions in central 
europe have limped along for 15 years without any results the new 
negotiations between nato and the sevennation communist bloc are 
more ambitious seeking to reduce tensions from the atlantic to the 
ural mountains 
there was no specific promise in the declaration that the 
western europeans and canada will contribute a larger share to 
natos defenses the united states currently shoulders about 70 
percent of the financial burden 
but the statement cited a ontinuing commitment to share 
equitably the risks burdens and responsibilities as well as the 
benefits of our common endeavor 
a hard decision on defense costs was not expected until the 
winter nato meeting in december 
on another point the declaration said the ministers had 
discussed the ripening situation in eastern europe in light of the 
economic and political reforms under way in the soviet union 
secretary of state george p shultz and other us officials 
have stressed that the west should provide economic assistance to 
eastern european nations only if there is political reform 
the ministers also welcomed the results of the recent may 29 
june 2 summit in moscow between president reagan and general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev both for their substance and as a 
portent for the future development of eastwest relations 
we welcome the unprecedented prominence accorded to human 
rights in the joint statement of the summit and hope that a more 
forthcoming soviet attitude will also be reflected in the 
concluding document of the current session of the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe in vienna

say tom is there any possibility of you reciting a poem for us 
and frequently he would do this and would uplift our spirits 
only one american has been held hostage in lebanon longer than

workers used shovels and their bare 
hands today to dig up 12 bodies from a mass grave where human 
rights advocates say victims of rightwing death squads may have 
been buried 
the churchbacked ecumenical movement for justice and peace said 
the threesquareyard shallow pit held at least 22 bodies which 
were mysteriously buried in april at the suburban south cemetery 
movement officials obtained a court order authorizing exhumation 
of the bodies to determine whether they were members of the 
leftwing youth for democracy and nationalism reported missing 
since april 
lawyer romeo capulong the movements chairman called the court 
order a breakthrough in efforts to locate victims of death squads 
the relatives of victims of disappearances were never able to 
find a mass grave like this capulong said 
health department workers began the dig after spraying the area 
with disinfectant the workers found the first body about three 
feet below the surface of the muddy pit by late afternoon the 
diggers had found at least 12 decomposing bodies including that of 
a woman 
we believe the presence of mass graves is an indication of 
death squads all around us said sister pat lardizabal a roman 
catholic nun 
however dr ethelyn nieto manila city health officer claimed 
at least some of the bodies had been properly buried after 
autopsies nieto said the bodies had remained unclaimed for months 
before they were buried 
volunteer dr aurora parong said at least one of the bodies 
showed that it had not undergone an autopsy 
the fact that he was not autopsied shows us that he could have 
been illegally buried she claimed 
she said the digging would continue until all 22 bodies believed 
buried there were recovered 
amor cabusao 55 was looking for her missing son ernesto a 
laborer he disappeared july 17 during a police sweep of manilas 
slum district of tondo which military authorities claim to have 
been a refuge for communist hit squads in the capital 
at least 100 soldiers policemen and village officials were 
killed by communist guerrillas in the capital last year 
civil rights groups have frequently charged their members have 
been victims of rightwing death squads seeking to eliminate 
leftists and sympathizers to the 19year communist insurgency

many south koreans reacted with 
disappointment and anger today to moves by radical students to 
march to communist north korea for unification talks 
what a stupid idea it is they are simply crazy said the 
owner of a small bakery near yonsei university in seoul where 
thousands of students battled riot police 
i supported them when they fought for democracy last year but 
this time i simply dont understand them said the shopkeeper 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
coughing and sneezing in a small bakery filled with drifting 
tear gas the shopkeeper said he could not understand the students 
shouting the same slogans that north korea puts out daily through 
its propaganda outlets 
few people interviewed supported or showed sympathy with the 
students who called for talks with their north korean counterparts 
on reuniting their land left divided since the end of world war ii 
in 1945 
chung soonim a 38yearold housewife said sarcastically 
let them go to the north and live there for a few months they 
need to learn by experience what is good and bad 
a uniformed army captain interviewed in a subway said i would 
like to shoot them they are too naive or idiots 
president roh taewoo who took office feb 25 after victory in 
last decembers elections has liberalized debate on unification 
but said the government should serve as a unified channel of 
dialogue with north korea 
i do agree that the students have the right to meet their 
north korean friends it would help ease the bitter rivalry between 
the two sides dissident buddhist monk song kwan said after a 
rally at yonsei university 
another dissident leader moon ikhwan told students at the 
rally the roh taewoo regime has neither capability nor will to 
push national unification i support the student talks 
about 4000 students shooting clenched fists into the air rose 
in wild cheers and sang a song titled our lifelong wish is 
unification 
but many intellectuals say the student activism could backfire 
they point out that the military staged a coup in 1961 after 
radical students called for similar unification talks with north 
korea

costa rican president and nobel 
prizewinner oscar arias pledged to continue pressing for peace in 
central america and asked harvard university graduates to join him 
in taking risks to build a different world 
at an overcast rainy 337th commencement ceremony thursday 
arias told 25000 harvard graduates alumni and spectators that he 
maintained a dream of peace and democracy in strifetorn central 
america 
arias 48 received the 1987 nobel peace prize for a plan to end 
conflict in the region 
when we proposed the peace plan for central america many 
people thought we were wrong and that that was an impossible 
dream arias said out of that risk we now have a chance for 
peace and guns have been silenced in nicaragua for the first time 
in 20 years 
dont ever fear the risks you will have to take to build a 
different world dont ever fear the risks when you are acting on 
your own principles you will soon learn that the accommodation 
with the old world a world where you see violence and injustice 
poverty and submission offers no reward 
before arias spoke harvard president derek bok assailed the 
hypocrisy of encouraging students to address the gravest problems 
of society while perpetuating conditions that make it very 
difficult for them to do so 
bok cited statistics showing fewer harvard graduates entering 
government teaching manufacturing or social work and he pinned 
blame on the failure of salaries in those fields to approach ones 
in private professional jobs 
bok conferred degrees to the 5526 graduates en masse school by 
school 
business school graduates were booed roundly when they stood to 
receive their degrees waving 100 bills 
in presenting an honorary doctor of laws degree bok praised 
arias for his clear voice of peace and reason for our new world 
other honorary degree recipients were economist john kenneth 
galbraith christian science monitor editor kay fanning operatic 
soprano jessye norman mathematician david harold blackwell roman

norways consul general has been arrested 
for complicity in the secret dumping of 15000 tons of toxic waste 
from the united states the government said 
the arrest announced thursday was the latest event in a 
growing scandal over dumping of toxic wastes in africa by developed 
countries 
proposals for shipping such material are on the increase 
according to a greenpeace international report released thursday in 
caracas venezuela 
guinea identified the norwegian consul general as sigmund strome 
but provided no other details about the charges international law 
gives diplomats immunity from prosecution 
ibrahima sory diaby guinean secretary of state for security 
announced on radio conakry that several guinean employees of the 
ministry of commerce also were arrested for granting import 
licenses for the waste 
the toxic material which was dumped on the island of kassa off 
conakry originated in the united states diaby said he said it 
was shipped from philadelphia 
the west african nations government said a norwegian company 
with government links alukoguinee imported the waste and was 
still holding 85000 tons 
diaby said the waste had been imported under the guise of 
construction materials and the company was to receive 50 per ton 
for each ton of waste 
the government has demanded that the waste be returned at the 
cost of the company 
the dumping was discovered when trees began dying on the island 
the government said 
in caracas representatives of greenpeace distributed their 
report during a conference devoted to drafting a global accord on 
controlling the international shipments of hazardous wastes the 
fiveday meeting sponsored by the un environment program 
includes delegates from 50 nations and 14 international 
organizations 
the greenpeace report said 12 shipments of hazardous wastes 
including five involving us firms have been designated for 
transport from industrialized countries to africa this year the

united states before 1988

japan already the worlds largest donor of 
overseas economic aid will expand its aid program to developing 
countries if the current level is not enough foreign minister 
sosuke uno said today 
uno also said japan would continue to concentrate on boosting 
demand in the domestic economy to relieve its trade surplus with 
other countries 
our 7 billion in oda official development assistance is the 
greatest in the world although in terms of percentage of the gross 
national product it may not be uno said in a luncheon speech at 
the japan national press club if our efforts toward oda are not 
enough we will work harder 
he did not say how the government would determine if japans 
efforts were sufficient 
boosted by the surging value of the yen japans assistance has 
risen from 38 billion in 1985 to about 74 billion in fiscal 
1987 which ended march 31 the budget for the current fiscal year 
is 10 billion 
japanese development aid this year is about 03 percent of 
japans gross national product below the average 036 percent for 
major western donor countries 
uno said such aid to developing countries was for humanitarian 
and global security purposes 
us defense secretary frank carlucci urged the japanese 
government during a visit to tokyo this week to increase its aid to 
strategically important third world countries such as pakistan 
portugal turkey and afghanistan 
carlucci also called on japan to bolster its own military and 
increase financial support of us troops stationed in this country 
just dont ask us to send our selfdefense forces abroad 
uno said today dont ask us to take any guns overseas 
western allies have urged japan to take a more active role in 
global security the government says the constitution which 
renounces war limits japanese contributions to nonmilitary 
actions 
uno said his forthcoming trip to israel as the first japanese 
cabinet official to visit that country represents absolutely no 
change in japanese policy toward the middle east 
it is not at all a case of emphasizing israel and neglecting 
the arab countries or emphasizing arab countries and neglecting 
israel he said there is absolutely no change in our mideast 
policy 
japan imports 99 percent of its oil and is heavily dependent on 
middle east petroleum tokyo tries to maintain cordial relations 
with most arab countries as well as with israel

two europeans and a filipino of 
german descent were arrested in a rebelinfested area and accused 
of training communist insurgents a senior military officer said 
today 
col hernani figueroa spokesman for the armys southern luzon 
island command identified the three as antonio bosch 46 a 
filipino of german descent klaus schmidt 52 a west german 
protestant minister and stellan hermansson 30 a swede 
figueroa said the three were arrested wednesday during a 
military operation in quezon province he said they had been 
training communist rebels in the bondoc peninsula of quezon 
province a rebel stronghold 
he said two soldiers identified them as being with a band of new 
peoples army guerrillas who raided the town of san francisco last 
february the soldiers were captured in the raid but escaped by 
killing their guards a few days later 
figueroa said the three were undergoing interrogation and were 
being held in a room at the command headquarters in lucena city 60 
miles southeast of manila 
he said the military planned to charge them with either 
espionage or murder and robbery in the san francisco raid he said 
the trio was found with a camera containing film of rebels training 
and hermansson was depicted holding a 30caliber machine gun 
spokesmen for the west german and swedish embassies said they 
were unaware of the reports a spokesman for st andrews 
theological seminary in manila said schmidt had been teaching

19year insurgency to establish a communist state 
last month a captured rebel claimed journalists from new 
zealand paid her guerrilla unit to stage an ambush in february in

when the house of representatives shifts seats 
from one state to another following the 1990 census some of the 
changes may be caused by people living in korea germany and other 
foreign nations 
a house subcommittee voted thursday to require that americans 
living overseas be counted in the census for purposes of 
reapportionment 
traditionally they have not been included in the count because 
the census is designed to distribute house seats among states and 
people overseas do not reside in any particular state 
but in recent years the question has become an emotional issue 
with some politicians questioning the policy of counting illegal 
aliens who live in the united states but excluding citizens who 
happen to be living abroad 
the constitution requires that apportionment be based on a count 
of all the people residing in the states thus illegal aliens are 
counted because they do reside in the country 
the bill approved by the house census subcommittee calls for a 
count of all americans living outside the country for purposes of 
house seats those people would be considered residents of 
whichever state they last lived in for a period of at least six 
months 
the bill now goes to the full post office and civil service 
committee its future is uncertain 
the justice department has raised questions about the 
constitutionality of apportioning among the states people living 
overaseas 
the commerce department parent agency of the census bureau 
also opposes the requirement contending that it would not have 
enough time to plan and budget for the large and costly overseas 
effort and pointing out that administrative records do not exist 
to show the past residence of many people 
the census bureau has reached an agreement with the defense 
department to count military personnel overseas pentagon officials 
last year estimated that there were 506000 military personnel and 
385000 of their dependents in foreign posts 
however there are also unknown numbers of federal civilian 
workers and their dependents overseas these include employees of 
11 cabinet departments and 17 different federal agencies spread 
across 160 foreign nations according to the office of personnel 
management 
there are also americans in private business living overseas 
and no records are kept of them 
past efforts to estimate the number of overseas residents who 
come from various states have run into problems many military 
personnel for example listed as home the coastal community from 
which they shipped out or in other cases claimed as their usual 
residence one of the states which has no personal income tax 
if the measure should become law however it could have an 
impact on the number of house seats distributed to various states 
following the 1990 census 
the private election data services company estimated in april 
that a 18 states stand to gain or lose house seats following that 
head count 
but while that companys figures showed pennsylvania losing 
three house seats the state was only 14762 residents short of 
retaining one of those seats minnesota on the other hand held 
onto one of its seats by a margin of only 5390 people 
thus if the overseas count boosted pennsylvania at the expense 
of minnesota a house seat could easily shift between those two 
states other shifts might also be possible depending on which 
states gained or lost in the overseas count 
the other side of the apportionment coin counting illegal 
aliens remains at issue with the matter currently before a 
federal court 
rep mervyn m dymally dcalif chairman of the census 
subcommittee announced that he and rep don edwards dcalif are 
seeking to intervene in that suit in support of continuing to count 
aliens in the census excluding them can only be done through 
constitutional amendment said dymally 
the suit seeking to block the counting of aliens was brought by 
rep tom petri rwis and a coalition of other congressmen and 
private groups

a former eagle scout who 
sought his own execution for the sexrelated murders of five boys 
went calmly to his death today saying though perhaps too little 
too late i am doing the right thing now 
arthur gary bishop a 36yearold former bookkeeper and 
excommunicated mormon was pronounced dead by injection at utah 
state prison at 1216 am said myron march department of 
corrections director of field operations 
give my apologies to the families of the victims were 
bishops last spoken words said warden jerry cook 
he went peacefully to the execution chamber march said 
three drugs in succession sodium pentothal the muscle 
relaxant pavulon and potassium chloride were dripped 
intravenously into bishops right arm the former mormon 
missionary clad in a white jumpsuit and strapped to a gurney 
appeared to stop breathing a minute after the injection began at 
1209 am he was pronounced dead eight minutes later 
bishop who strangled shot or bludgeoned and drowned his 
victims told police he got sexual pleasure out of seeing their 
bodies naked afterwards he said he relived his first murder by 
buying and killing as many as 20 puppies 
he was the 99th person to be executed in this country and the 
third in utah since a 1976 us supreme court ruling ended a 
nationwide moratorium on capital punishment the first to die was 
convicted killer gary gilmore who was executed by a firing squad 
at the same prison in early 1977 
bishop decided earlier this year to shun further appeals and be 
executed an act of contrition he hoped would bring peace to his 
victims families 
with great sadness and remorse i realize that i allowed 
myself to be misled by satan and as a result my life has been 
marked by wicked perverse and depraved actions he wrote in a 
final statement released after his execution 
at this time i want to offer again my most profound and 
heartfelt apologies to my victims families he wrote i am 
truly sorry 
bishop wrote that he hoped my death may help others to find 
relief and forgiveness though perhaps too little too late i 
am doing the right thing now 
in the hours before his execution bishop pored over the bible 
and mormon scriptures and prayed and met with clergy 
mormon bishop heber geurts a volunteer chaplain at the prison 
said bishop was calm and cool and was the most sorrowful and 
repentent and remorseful man of the thousands of inmates hed 
seen in 33 years 
about 30 people held a candlelight vigil outside the prison 
before bishops execution 
we have to be here tonight to show our opposition to the whole 
policy of capital punishment said grady walker of the utah 
coalition to abolish the death penalty most of us are keenly 
aware of what he did we simply feel that adding bishops corpse 
will not bring those five children back or undo what bishop has 
done 
a few demonstrators however came to voice their support of 
capital punishment sandra wiggins said she and her young brother 
came in memory of bishops victims and their families 
im a mother myself she said i came to let them know im 
thinking of them

federal health officials saying testing only 
highrisk women has not worked are now recommending hepatitis 
testing for all pregnant women and immediate vaccinations if 
necessary for their babies 
the new recommendation announced thursday by the national 
centers for disease control is aimed at preventing some 3500 
american babies each year from becoming carriers of typeb 
hepatitis 
each year in the united states about 16500 babies are born to 
mothers with hepatitis b infections the cdc said about 3500 of 
those infants become chronic hepatitis b carriers and it is 
estimated that more than 25 percent of them will die of liver 
cancer or cirrhosis 
in 1984 the cdc recommended hepatitis b tests for women in 
highrisk groups such as intravenous drug users and some venereal 
disease patients but the agency said thursday that many 
obstetricians dont know what the highrisk groups are and the 
plan has not worked 
it is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women 
is the only strategy that will provide acceptable control of 
mothertochild hepatitis b transmission the atlantabased cdc 
said 
the cdcs immunization practices advisory committee said 
pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis b during an early 
prenatal visit if a woman is infected her baby should receive 
hepatitis b immune globulin preferably within 12 hours of birth 
to provide immediate protection and hepatitis b vaccine within 
seven days and again at 1 month and 6 months 
such a routine is between 85 percent and 95 percent effective in 
preventing a child from becoming a chronic hepatitis b carrier cdc 
researchers said 
hepatitis b vaccine is the first human vaccine that can 
prevent both serious chronic disease and a uniformly fatal type of 
cancer the cdc noted 
still vaccinating every newborn child in the united states for 
hepatitis b is not currently practical from a cost standpoint said 
dr mark kane a cdc hepatitis specialist a childs vaccine 
regimen costs 60 or more he said 
in addition to intravenous drug users and people who have had 
multiple venereal disease infections other highrisk categories 
are homosexually active men and medical personnel exposed to blood 
on the job the cdc said 
kane said studies have shown that the cdcs previous 
recommendations were inadequate 
in one study for example 40 percent of obstetricians couldnt 
name more than two highrisk groups for hepatitis b and 72 percent 
didnt know the recommended treatment for infants born to infected 
mothers the cdc said 
in addition studies in several innercity hospitals that test 
all pregnant women found that only 35 percent to 65 percent of 
those infected would fall under the old guidelines 
hepatitis b is one of the two most common forms of hepatitis a 
serious inflammation of the liver hepatitis b is transmitted 
chiefly in the blood there is not yet a vaccine for hepatitis a 
which is most commonly associated with poor hygiene 
about 25000 cases of each type occur in the united states each 
year

the home affairs minister has 
asked his staff to prepare a report on whether the british 
broadcasting co should be expelled from south africa the ministry 
said today 
on thursday law and order minister adriaan vlok suggested that 
the bbc might be ordered out because of a film it broadcast in 
britain this week about detained black children in south africa 
naturally the bbc regrets any action which would further 
impede its coverage from south africa bbc spokesman john 
moulding said in london today asked whether the bbc was justified 
is televising the film he said were satisfied with the 
journalistic integrity of the film 
in johannesburg home affairs minister stoffel botha who is in 
charge of foreign press credentials instructed his staff to look 
into the presence of the bbc in south africa and report to him 
the ministry said 
it said botha might issue a statement on the matter next week 
the south african government had appealed to the bbc for a 
chance to view the film suffer the children before it was 
broadcast wednesday night the bbc refused 
the bbc said it had commissioned the report from an independent 
londonbased company penumbra which filmed inside south africa 
without government permission and without seeking police comment 
because of emergency restrictions on the news media 
vlok said thursday that a bbc spokesman had phoned his office 
wednesday asking for comment on allegations in the film about 
torture of children during police interrogation vlok said that 
when his press spokesman leon mellet asked the bbc why the 
comment had not been sought earlier the interviewer had said 
quite frankly the bbc does not believe the south african 
government 
vlok said if this is the bbcs attitude then why should the 
south african government continue to host their representatives in 
our country

new hospital rules curtailing the long hours 
that dull the reactions of interns and residents mean they will 
ultimately become better doctors the state health commissioner 
says 
under the rules adopted thursday doctors training at hospitals 
in the state will no longer be scheduled for 36hour shifts and 
100hourplus work weeks 
the action curbs a training system for doctors that some 
considered a rite of passage but that critics have condemned as 
part hazing part labor exploitation and dangerous to patients 
the commissioner dr david axelrod a champion of the reforms 
said he expected the states action to spearhead a national trend 
new york with 13000 residents and interns has 16 percent of 
the nations doctors in training while an additional 6 percent are 
to be found in teaching hospitals in neighboring massachusetts 
where similar rules are about to be adopted axelrod said 
ultimately these regulations will mean that we have better 
trained physicians and a higher quality of care he said 
a review of doctor training began in the wake of a grand jury 
report citing faulty hospital care in the 1984 death of libby zion 
18yearold daughter of writer sidney zion 
the new rules put a 12hour limit on emergency room shifts for 
interns residents and attending physicians 
in other services young doctors will not be required to put in 
more than 24 hours a shift and their work week may not average more 
than 80 hours during any four consecutive weeks they will have at 
least eight free hours between work shifts at least one full day 
off every week and will be barred from moonlighting at other 
hospitals 
the 32member state hospital review and planning council adopted 
the code revisions without dissent 
axelrod said the 12hour emergency room shift which is to take 
effect oct 1 already is being followed in 95 percent of the 
states teaching hospitals most of the other new rules will go 
into effect july 1 1989 
in the past axelrod said grueling hours have led interns to 
refer to some patients as gomers which stands for get out of 
my emergency room 
i think well see a change in the way they view the 
patients the commissioner said i think we will also see 
better judgment by the physicians in training because they will no 
longer be sleepdeprived and fatigued 
miss zions father who has been campaigning to curb interns 
working hours since his daughters death said thursday he welcomed 
the changes 
at least libby didnt die in vain he said

jet lag hamstrings tens of millions of travelers 
annually and most dont know how to combat it although proven 
stategies exist to reduce or eliminate it a new survey indicates 
the survey found that 94 percent of people jetting across three 
or more time zones suffered symptoms of jet lag and 45 percent 
were bothered severely yet less than half tried to do anything 
about it 
if you ask the average person what could he or she do most 
might only say take a semirest the first day or two when you 
arrive said dr michael irwin medical director of the united 
nations 
yet he said several ways of coping are known to be helpful 
irwin was in chicago on thursday to discuss findings of the poll 
of 784 longdistance travelers the study commissioned by the 
upjohn co of kalamazoo mich was conducted by pollsters rl 
associates of princeton nj with the help of united airlines and 
british airways 
symptoms that bothered more than nine of 10 included fatigue 
sleeplessness impaired concentration slowed reflexes 
irritablity upset digestion hunger at odd hours andor 
depression the survey found 
yet only about 45 percent of the total said they did anything to 
avoid the ill effects it said 
those who did make an effort most commonly avoided alcohol on 
the flight rested a few days on arrival exercised daily on 
arrival adjusted sleeping patterns before leaving or used a 
shortterm sleeping medication the first night or two in the new 
place 
most people still dont realize to avoid alcohol on the 
plane said irwin whose interest in the problem of jet lag 
developed from his duties overseeing the health of un staff 
the reason is that the combination of dry air inside the plane 
less than 5 percent humidity with the alcohol makes you very 
dehydrated and its harder to adjust to a different time zone 
he said at least 100 biochemical and hormonal rhythms exist in 
the body which govern daily cycles such as sleep and all suffer 
with dehydration 
jet lag is worse flying from west to east as evidenced by the 
finding that 23 percent of east coast travelers to europe reported 
severe jet lag while only 14 percent had severe problems on the 
reverse trip the survey said 
on long trips crossing three or four time zones exercising 
outdoors can do much toward resetting the biological clock irwin 
said 
he said it would be ideal to exercise in morning daylight after 
an eastward flight to help the body to adjust to an earlier day 
and in evening daylight after a westward flight to help the body 
to adjust to a later day 
shortacting sleeping medications known as benzodiazepines are 
also very useful to help readjust sleeping patterns the first day 
or two after arrival without causing grogginess during normal 
waking hours he said 
only take medication prescribed by a doctor not something 
given by a friend or bought over the counter irwin said 
the travelers surveyed had made at least two roundtrips of 
5000 miles once eastward and once westward in the 24 months 
before the survey in june 1987 said upjohn spokesman leonard h 
gross 
us airlines carried more than 29 million passengers on 
international flights from june 1985 through may 1986 the company 
said even if only half flew east or west the survey suggests the 
number of people suffering jet lag is huge the company said

conservatives angry at solicitor general 
charles fried for hiring a deputy they view as too liberal want 
fried dismissed unless the solicitor general urges the supreme 
court to overrule a major civil rights precedent 
fried is the departments no 4 official who after considering 
resigning in march has stayed on despite a wave of protest 
resignations and departures by top aides to attorney general edwin 
meese iii over the past 2 months 
we urge you to relieve mr fried of his responsibilities if 
the solicitor general refuses to file a brief supporting reversal 
of the precedent paul kamenar executive legal director of the 
washington legal foundation said in a letter to meese 
fried is considering what position the government should take in 
response to the courts 54 vote to invite arguments in runyon v 
mccrary in that 1976 case the court ruled that a civil rights law 
from the reconstruction era could be used to desegregate private 
schools and to seek damages for racial discrimination in a wide 
range of areas 
kamenars letter wednesday also criticized frieds decision to 
hire with meeses approval harvard law school professor david 
shapiro as deputy solicitor general 
shapiro wrote a 1976 law review article criticizing supreme 
court chief justice william rehnquist as a judge who is inflexibile 
and whose performance on the bench is below his capabilities 
because of his unyielding ideology department officials 
successfully pushed for rehnquists elevation to chief justice 
justice department conservatives were angry over the naming of 
shapiro say department sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the conservative weekly human events calls shapiro a 
liberal and says he should not have been hired by fried and 
approved by meese 
frieds selection of shapiro comes at a period when meese beset 
by legal problems and trying to hang onto his job wants as many 
top officials as possible to remain in place to avoid the 
perception that the department is in trouble 
meese was informed ahead of time about frieds plans to hire 
shapiro and was told of his background justice department 
spokesman patrick korten said today 
the attorney general has always permitted department heads to 
choose their own deputies said korten the department spokesman 
denied that meese was giving fried a free hand to keep the 
solicitor general from leaving the justice department 
fried also has recently hired as lawyers in his office a clerk 
to a liberal district of columbia circuit court judge and another 
clerk to a federal judge who was an appointee of president carter 
and a former aide to sen edward kennedy dmass

the sixmonthold uprising on the west bank has 
erased palestinian fear of israel and changed the rules in the 
fight over the occupied territories said two palestinian christian 
leaders in urging presbyterians to oppose israeli and us policy 
in the region 
the uprising has really changed things the rev naim ateek 
told reporters thursday at the 200th general assembly of the 
presbyterian church usa 
ateek an ecumenical delegate to the meeting from the episcopal 
church of jerusalem and the middle east said peace efforts by 
secretary of state george shultz have been doomed because he has a 
preuprising agenda 
the presbyterians are considering resolutions calling on israel 
to end its 20year occupation of the west bank and gaza and join in 
a united nationssponsored international peace conference israel 
captured the territories from jordan and egypt respectively in 
the 1967 sixday war 
the palestinian discussion is one of a number of issues before 
various committees of the assembly which meet today and saturday 
before beginning their reports to the 630member assembly the 
nineday meeting ends wednesday 
other topics include consideration of a report on christian 
obedience in a nuclear age a controversial paper that has drawn 
criticism within the 3 millionmember denomination because of its 
discussions of church support for those who choose to resist 
government actions 
ateek said the palestinians want a homeland alongside israel 
his contacts with fellow palestinians in east jerusalem have led 
him to believe that most have accepted the existence of israel he 
said 
however the palestine liberation organization seen by most 
palestinians as their representative does not officially recognize 
israel its constitution remains committed to the destruction of 
the jewish state 
ateeks conclusions were echoed by the rev elias chacour a 
priest in the melkite church in jerusalem who was awarded the 
peaceseeker award today by the presbyterian peace fellowship a 
sanctioned group with the denomination 
chacour told reporters israel must deal with the palestinians 
soon because they have no more patience no more possibility to 
wait under intolerable conditions 
the paper before the presbyterians accuses israel of 
systematic violation of the human rights of palestinians in the 
occupied territories especially through administrative 
detention collective punishment and torture of prisoners and 
suspects and the deportation of dissidents 
recommendations addressing us conduct include calling for 
pressure on israel to cease use of excessive force and supporting a 
un peace conference the paper also opposes efforts to expel the 
plos un mission in new york 
the christian obedience paper is undergoing a linebyline 
review by a subcommittee of the assemblys committee on peacemaking 
and international relations the same assembly committee that will 
address the middle east paper 
objections center on what opponents say is encouragement of 
denominational support for resisting the government on a variety of 
issues 
the full assembly will begin hearing committee reports saturday 
afternoon but many of the more controversial issues wont be taken 
up until next week

nearly a century after the famed dreyfus affair 
divided france a statue of capt alfred dreyfus has unleashed a 
debate over antisemitism racial hatred and the national front 
party 
culture minister jack lang who commissioned the statue and 
spoke when it went on public display thursday said the attitudes 
that led to the jewish army officers false conviction for treason 
survive in todays france in the form of the extremeright national 
front 
the partys head jeanmarie le pen ran on an antiimmigration 
platform in aprils firstround presidential elections and took a 
surprising 144 percent of the vote 
i didnt realize that my first act as a minister would 
coincide with what were living through on a moral and political 
level said lang who returned to his former post last month in a 
new socialist government 
the national front is the party of the antidreyfusards he 
said three days before runoff elections for national assembly 
lang spoke at the statues new site in the tuileries gardens near 
the seine river 
le pen denies accusations of racism and antisemitism 
the dreyfus affair was launched by french author emile zola in 
his broadside jaccuse i accuse which charged that false 
evidence with antisemitic motives was used to frame dreyfus on 
charges of giving military secrets to the germans 
the case raged for years dividing france into prodreyfusards 
and antidreyfusards zola fled the country to avoid punishment for 
libel but was later cleared 
the 11foottall statue which shows dreyfus standing at 
attention and holding a broken saber upright in front of his face 
sparked a public debate even before it was finished 
in 1985 lang proposed placing it in the ecole militaire 
courtyard where dreyfus was stripped of his rank and dishonored in 
a ceremony on jan 5 1895 that plan was opposed by socialist 
defense minister charles hernu who said the courtyard was 
inappropriate because it is closed to the public 
it was widely thought however that many in the french army 
objected to the statue and the public debate was called a new 
dreyfus affair 
when the statue by sculptor louis mitelberg who works under the 
name tim was completed in 1986 the conservative government of 
former premier jacques chirac decided not to put it on public 
display 
lang said he hoped the statue could be displayed near the 
courthouse in central paris where judicial proceedings eventually 
cleared dreyfus of any guilt 12 years after he was exiled to 
devils island dreyfus later was reinstated as a major in the army 
and received the legion of honor 
so far the city administration under chirac who remains mayor 
of paris has balked lang said because the tuileries is national 
property the citys agreement was not needed to place the statue 
there 
lang denied any political motive in bringing out the statue 
three days before runoff elections for the national assembly but 
he denounced the centerright coalition parties for making an 
agreement with the national front not to run candidates against 
each other in a few key districts

wholesale prices led by the steepest increase in food costs 
since january rose a moderate 05 percent in may the government 
said today 
if the may increase held steady for 12 straight months 
inflation at the wholesale level would be 58 percent nearly 
triple the modest 2 percent increase of the past 12 months the 
labor department said 
the index for wholesale prices at the finished goods level minus 
energy and food was up 03 percent analysts consider this a more 
reliable indicator of underlying inflation because of the 
monthtomonth volatility of food and energy costs 
over the past year wholesale prices excluding food and energy 
have risen 28 percent 
on thursday the government reported that us businesses plan 
the biggest increases in spending on new plant and equipment in 
four years 
the commerce department said the ambitious investment plans were 
partly due to an improvement in the trade picture but the 
department also said announced that the trade deficit is shrinking 
more slowly than previously reported 
the stock market was mostly lower thursday as the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials up 4836 on wednesday slipped back 960 
to 209335 
bond prices slipped and interest rates rose as higher commodity 
prices stirred concerns about inflation the dollar also lost 
ground 
the commerce department said us companies plan to increase 
their spending on plant and equipment this year by 119 percent 
over 1987 
the increased investment found in a may survey was partly the 
result of companies gearing up to produce more goods for export 
and replace imports with products made at home 
if the projected 1988 increase in capital spending actually 
occurs it will be the biggest gain in plant and equipment spending 
since 1984 when spending shot up 166 percent as businesses 
recovered from the 198182 recession 
manufacturing especially in 1988 looks like it has very 
aggressive plans thats got to be good news said david 
wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc of 
lexington mass 
however wyss warned that rising interest rates or renewed 
trouble in the stock market could cause businesses to quickly scale 
back expansion plans 
in a separate report the department recalculated its trade 
statistics to account for seasonal patterns in shipments and found 
the deficits came out bigger the march deficit was put at 119 
billion 22 percent higher than the previously reported 97 
billion 
the nonadjusted figure of 97 billion for the march trade gap 
the best showing in three years had been hailed by the reagan 
administration as solid evidence that the countrys trade problems 
had finally turned around 
the administration said the new figures still showed an 
improving trend and private economists agreed 
there is no reason to be discouraged by the new figures 
said allen sinai chief economist at boston co 
in another report the conference board a businesssupported 
research group said pay increases should average about 5 percent 
this year and next for the nations salaried workers narrowly 
outpacing expected inflation

security forces arrested a 
palestinian suspected of stabbing the israeliappointed mayor of a 
west bank town and demolished his cinderblock house today in the 
jelazoun refugee camp 
villagers said soldiers arrested khamis jawdat faraj 26 late 
thursday night the army confirmed the arrest and said faraj had 
stalked the mayor and stabbed him as an act of palestinian 
nationalism 
arab news reports meanwhile said the army arrested two 
palestinian reporters and a writer in a continuing crackdown on 
arab journalists an israeli newspaper said the military may shut 
down west bank schools again 
it took 30 minutes for a large yellow bulldozer to destroy the 
threeroom house where faraj lived with his 60yearold mother 
only an almond tree plum tree and rose bush were left standing in 
the yard after the demolition 
they are destroying our house i dont know what for said 
the suspects mother nozha faraj who watched the army operation 
from next door 
faraj was arrested in connection with the stabbing tuesday of 
hassan tawil the 74yearold mayor of el bireh the army follows a 
longstanding practice of demolishing the homes of suspects in what 
it considers terrorist acts 
tawil was stabbed in the heart and was reported recovering 
faraj has been detained several times previously because of 
alleged involvement in public disturbances an army statement said 
he followed the mayors movements intending to assassinate him 
and attempted to do so previously without success the statement 
said 
underground leaflets issued by leaders of the sixmonth arab 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip have repeatedly 
called for israeliappointed officials like tawil to quit their 
posts 
more than 200 palestinians and two israelis have been killed in 
the violence 
the hebrew daily newspaper haaretz today quoted army sources as 
saying schools could close again if students follow orders given in 
underground leaflets to leave classes at noon 
schools used to recess at noon but authorities have extended 
classroom time to 1230 pm or 1 pm to make up for the four 
months schools were closed during the height of the uprising

a jury has awarded 25 million to the parents of 
two children who were crushed to death under the wheels of a truck 
as they were crossing the street with their mother 
the jury finding that a walkdont walk sign was partly to 
blame awarded the money thursday to building superintendent ismet 
delosovic 39 and his wife fatima 34 in the deaths of their 
children vaid 3 and blerini 5 court papers and attorneys gave 
conflicting spellings of the elder childs name which was also 
spelled blerim 
the truck driven by stephen rapczak 25 of garwood nj and 
owned by higgins trucking co of clifton nj hit the little boys 
may 8 1981 as they their mother and baby brother were crossing a 
street in greenwich village 
the delosovics lawyer gary pillersdorf said the light didnt 
give the four pedestrians enough time to cross the street turning 
green while they were in the crosswalk 
rapczak testified during the 4week trial that he was unable to 
see the family so he proceeded 
the two boys were killed almost instantly the mother and her 
third child 9monthold rizo suffered superficial injuries 
the jury found found rapczak and higgins trucking 44 percent 
liable but the delosovics had already settled with them for 
500000 
the remaining 56 percent of liability was divided equally 
between international harvester because of alleged poor design of 
the truck and the city because of alleged poor design of an 
intersection and an improperly functioning light 
this means international harvester must pay 28 percent of 25 
million or 7 million and the city must pay the same 
both defendants said they will appeal the verdict as excessive 
pillersdorf said 
she will never know joy again you could have given her 100

that she could not bear to feed her youngest child for a year and 
the two children she has had since then have been named after the 
boys who were killed 
justice edward lehner the trial judge scheduled a july 15 
hearing for motions on the verdict

george rodrigue displayed his oil paintings 
today on capitol hill where he encountered more glasnost than he 
found in the soviet union 
thirteen of the cajun artists paintings which caused a stir at 
the moscow summit were hung in a meeting room for a oneday show 
cosponsored by louisiana reps bob livingston a republican and 
james hayes a democrat 
the show came a week after rodrigue said a network television 
crew smuggled his paintings out of the soviet union following an 
exhibition during the moscow summit two of rodrigues paintings 
had been temporarily confiscated 
it was a remarkable contrast to see president reagan extolling 
perestroika and glasnost and at the very same time an american 
artist sees his paintings ripped off the walls livingston said 
hayes said he and livingston disagree politically on many 
issues but they are united in the idea that artists have a right 
to express themselves 
rodrigue said he resorted to smuggling the paintings out of the 
country after soviet functionaries refused to hand over the 
necessary exit permits so he could leave 
soviet officials wanted him to donate his portrait of kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev dressed in a yellow suit and carrying 
a red flag rodrigue said he declined the offer unless he could 
meet gorbachev personally 
the american television crew didnt have to go through 
customs because they were on a plane that carried reporters who 
covered the summit back to the united states rodrigue said 
he refused to identify the network by name for fear it would be 
subject to reprisals in the soviet union no one answered the 
telephone at the soviet information office and a message was not 
returned 
rodrigue 43 of lafayette la described his experience with 
the soviet bureaucracy as horrifying the worst show i ever 
had that contrasted with his view of ordinary russians who were 
real nice he said 
rodrigue was invited to the moscow summit by a soviet delegation 
that hoped to create a louisiana theme at moscows international 
trade center the heart of activity during the summit 
the paintings were to hang in a restaurant where a louisiana 
chef served cajun food 
rodrigue said his first disappointment was that ordinary soviet 
citizens were banned from the trade center so his paintings had 
only limited exposure primarily to american reporters and 
officials 
the day after he put up the oil paintings soviet officials 
confiscated the one that showed gorbachev and another depicting 
president reagan mounted on a white horse and wearing a cowboy hat 
officials gave conflicting reasons for the action but rodrigue 
called them all real stupid 
they asked why wasnt gorbachev on a horse he said 
then they said the paintings were too expensive then they 
asked why reagans painting did not have a sun in it 
he added the bottom line really is they didnt want the 
president hanging in a russian restaurant thats what i think 
rodrigue speculated that widespread media attention on the 
painting prompted the soviets to reconsider two days before he was 
to leave they rehung the two paintings 
a few hours later rodrigue removed the paintings for good and 
unsuccessfully asked for the exit permits

the university of massachusetts top 
administrator has asked the faculty senate to investigate 
allegations that a black professor was ousted from the 
afroamerican studies department for his views 
circumstances surrounding professor julius lesters reassignment 
to the judaic studies department might be referred to the american 
association of university professors for a formal investigation to 
clear up serious and in some cases perhaps misleading 
allegations chancellor joseph duffey said 
lester has accused the afroamerican studies department of 
racism in objecting to his criticisms of the black community and of 
such leaders as the rev jesse jackson and the late author james 
baldwin 
the department reacted to the baldwin criticism as if i had 
attacked every member lester has said theyre acting as if 
james baldwin is a person who is above criticism in effect 
theyre kicking me out if a white did this to a black faculty 
member people would say racism its no different if a black 
person does it to a black faculty member its worse 
department members met a few months ago to discuss lesters 
unorthodox views and voted to recommend that he be reassigned to 
another department 
lester had already begun talks with administrators about leaving 
the department when its members cast their vote the reassignment 
became official last week and was made with the approval of all 
parties involved 
in a letter duffey wrote afroamerican studies professor 
michael thelwell on thursday he criticized the department for the 
meeting and for a letter faculty members sent the dean of 
humanities suggesting lester would be infinitely more comfortable 
in a different location 
julius lester represents the kind of teacher this university 
cherishes duffey said thursday 
the department had written a 40page report rebutting lesters 
claim in his book lovesongs that baldwin made antisemitic 
remarks during a 1984 faculty discussion the report included 
transcripts of baldwins remarks 
because baldwin represented a constant struggle with racism of 
all forms we took those charges to be grossly serious thelwell 
said 
julius 49 is a 17year veteran of the department and the 
winner of the universitys most prestigious faculty awards 
he gained notoriety in the 1960s as a spokesman for the black 
power movement although he once broadcast a poem taunting jews he 
converted to judaism six years ago and has since irritated his 
black colleagues with his opinions he wrote an essay in 1984 for 
example accusing jackson of posing as a messiah to blacks in his 
quest for the democratic presidential nomination

iraq said its warplanes attacked a tanker 
off irans persian gulf coast at dawn today and shipping sources 
said two seamen were killed in an earlier iraqi air strike on a 
salvage tugboat 
the latest convoy of kuwaiti tankers and their us navy escorts 
passed through the strait of hormuz and sailed into the gulf today 
two small boats that resembled iranian speedboats approached the 
convoy but did not attack 
the official iraqi news agency quoted a military spokesman as 
saying the jets hit a large maritime target which usually 
means a tanker 
the spokesman who was not identified said the marauding 
fighterbombers scored an accurate and effective hit on the 
unidentified vessel 
there was no independent confirmation of the iraqi claim of an 
attack today but shipping sources in the gulf and the londonbased 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit said the 742ton tug salverve 
was hit by an iraqi missile thursday in the northern gulf 
thursdays attack was the first confirmed iraqi air raid on 
iranian shipping lanes in about four weeks 
lloyds which monitors shipping around the world said two 
crewmen were killed abord the singaporeflag tug shipping 
executives speaking on condition of anonymity said the casualties 
were probably filipinos 
the salverve has been hit twice before it suffered no 
casualties in the first attack july 7 but its british captain and 
two filipino crewmen were killed in a jan 28 raid when the 
salverve was towing a tanker damaged in an iraqi air strike the day 
before 
salverve is owned by the singaporebased semco salvage ltd one 
of the salvage companies that regularly work with iranians 
more than a halfdozen salvage tugs mainly semco vessels that 
operate off the iranian coast have been hit in the socalled 
tanker war a spinoff from the iraniraq conflict which began 
in september 1980 
iraqi warplanes regularly attack iranian tankers seeking to 
choke off tehrans vital oil exports which pay for its war effort 
the iranians retaliate by attacking neutral commercial ships in the 
waterway the last confirmed iraqi raid was on the iranflagged 
tanker bisoton may 16 
the 36th us convoy of the year three usflagged kuwaiti 
oil carriers and two escorting warships departed from an assembly 
area in the gulf of oman steamed through the strait of hormuz and 
entered the persian gulf early today 
the convoy guarded by the 3880ton guided missile frigate uss 
fahrion and the 7810ton destroyer uss john hancock was joined by 
about nine other ships from other countries that tagged along for 
the journey through the strait 
the two vessels that approached to within two miles of the 
convoy each carried two crew members but there was no sign of 
weapons said lt cmdr brad goforth a navy spokesman with a 
pentagon news media pool aboard the fahrion 
iran usually hits vessels sailing to or from kuwait or saudi 
arabia in its retaliatory strikes it accuses both countries of 
aiding iraq 
this prompted kuwait last summer to reregister 11 of its 
tankers in the united states to entitle them to us navy 
protection 
the us navy widened its protective role to nonamerican 
vessels may 3 and said its warships would aid any vessel in their 
vicinity if it was attacked by either side outside designated 
exclusion zones

phil donahue has razed an experimental 
allconcrete house despite criticism that he was destroying a 
landmark but the talkshow host questioned why the community let 
the 26yearold house fall into disrepair 
why didnt somebody take care of this building donahue said 
after the building next door to his classic tudorstyle mansion 
was demolished wednesday where were all these caring people when 
the building was unoccupied 
donahue who bought the concrete house and 72 acres of land 
around it for 6 million two months ago said he wanted more space 
privacy and security for his wife actress marlo thomas and their 
family he denied that he wanted to improve the view of long island 
sound from his mansion 
donahue said he didnt know about the houses architectural 
significance and that it had become a hostel for vagrants lovers 
and other strangers who left behind empty beer cans and 
mcdonalds wrappers 
some local historians described the concrete house as the 
affluent towns most architecturally significant building a piece 
of sculpture as well as a structure 
i still get knots in my stomach when i think about it said 
mary mccahon westports architectural historian it was a 
wonderful building the best design in westport tearing it down i 
think on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 10 its pretty bad 
john m johansen the internationally known architect who 
designed the house said this wasnt a very exemplary act from a 
public figure and theyve nicknamed him mr sensitivity 
the house designed in what mccahon called a 
contemporaryexpressionist style was built as a retirement cottage 
for a wealthy physician 
many people who are expressing deep concern have never seen 
the house nor have they been in it donahue said adding that 
the houses style left him cold i did not find this an inviting

the reagan administration has decided to sell 
f18 warplanes americas most sophisticated fighterbombers to 
the persian gulf nation of kuwait and will seek congressional 
approval white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today 
the decision will be sent to capitol hill imminently giving 
congress 50 days to approve or reject the sale which could include 
the transfer of up to 40 f18s according to an official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the administration wants to sell jets to kuwait to help that 
oilrich gulf state defend against strikes by combatants in the 
7yearold iraniraq war 
congressional opposition is possible however from members who 
have noted that kuwait like other arab nations is technically in 
a state of war with israel some congressmen have also expressed 
concern that selling advanced weapons to countries in the persian 
gulf will increase tensions in the region 
the official said administration representatives met privately 
on thursday with members of the senate foreign relations committee 
to explain the proposed sale 
state department spokesmen said last month that the 
administration favored the sale of advanced jets to kuwait but had 
not decided whether to ask congress to approve the transfer of 
f18s or less powerful f16s or f15s 
f18s have been specially designed for equal effectiveness as 
fighters and bombers the f15 the air forces hottest fighter is 
used mostly as an interceptor against other aircraft the f16 has 
dual capabilities as a fighter and bomber but according to 
administration experts the f18 can switch fighterbomber roles 
more quickly than the f16 
only australia canada and spain all formal allies of the 
united states have been permitted to buy f18s 
the official speaking today said the decision was made to pick 
f18s if kuwait purchases all 40 planes authorized the contract 
would be worth 1 billion to the manufacturer mcdonnell douglas 
in the international arms market the company competes heavily 
with the french makers of the mirage 2000 jet and administration 
officials are eager to see an american concern get the kuwaiti 
contract 
kuwait reportedly also wants to purchase weapons the f18 can 
carry in its arsenal maverick airtoground missiles airtoair 
sidewinder missiles and harpoon antiship missiles

scientists flying over the southern 
pacific ocean directly observed the atmosphere of pluto for the 
first time nasa has announced 
while scientists previously had strong indirect evidence for the 
existence of an atmosphere on the solar systems ninth planet the 
astronomers who viewed pluto from a telescope aboard nasas kuiper 
airborne observatory on thursday got the first direct look at it 
said space agency spokeswoman diane stanley 
the observations show that pluto is surrounded by what appears 
to be a substantial atmosphere said j kelly beatty senior editor 
for sky amp telescope magazine reporting in fridays edition of the 
boston globe beatty who rode aboard the nasa aircraft filed his 
report from pago pago in american samoa 
the discovery of a significant atmosphere could end years of 
debate over the extent of the atmosphere of pluto which averages 
more than 37 billion miles from the sun in its orbit beatty said 
the massachusetts institute of technology researchers flying at 
an altitude of 41000 feet used a solidstate video camera 
attached to a 36inch telescope to watch the light of a star as the 
tiny planet started to move in front of it 
as the edge of the planet started to move in front of the star 
changes in the light confirmed the existence of the atmosphere 
said stanley a spokeswoman at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations ames research center in mountain view 
james elliot and mit colleague edward w dunham said that pluto 
must be surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere because as the planet 
passed in front of the star the faint starlight disappeared and 
reappeared gradually rather than abruptly 
elliot and dunham said they are not yet sure what gases make up 
plutos atmosphere but possibilities include methane argon 
nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and neon 
the observations were made about 3500 miles south of hawaii 
the airborne observatory flew out of hawaii at 730 pm local time 
thursday and landed in pago pago 7 hours later 
in may 1987 scientists at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasadena published a study in the british journal nature contending 
that pluto has a substantial atmosphere of methane or natural gas 
they said observations of the planet in 1983 by the infrared 
astronomical satellite showed that plutos temperature was uniform 
over its entire surface something that could occur only if a 
significant atmosphere existed 
however scientists from the university of arizona and the 
planetary science institute both in tucson published a 
contradictory study last september in the journal science they 
said that evidence from the same satellite suggested plutos 
atmosphere was extremely thin at least 900 times less dense than 
earths atmosphere 
stanley said that the observations made thursday will after 
analysis provide information about the extent of plutos 
atmosphere and its temperature and pressure 
pluto which is thought to be half ice and half rock usually is 
thought of as the ninth planet from the sun but because it has an 
elongated elliptical orbit it will be the eighth planet from the 
sun until 1990 when it heads outward beyond neptunes orbit

president pw botha today 
extended the twoyear nationwide state of emergency for another 
year and tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activity 
antiapartheid leaders assailed the proclamation which will 
leave hundreds of prominent activists in jail without charge 
the emergency regulations allow sweeping powers of detention 
outlaw many forms of peaceful antigovernment protest and restrict 
freedom of speech press and assembly 
white women from the black sash civil rights group stood along 
highways in johannesburg during the morning rush hour with posters 
saying apartheid is the emergency a multiracial crowd of 100 
attended a vigil for the estimated 2500 emergency detainees at 
johannesburgs central methodist church 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu said extension of the emergency 
is a pointless and bankrupt exercise which aggravates south 
africas crisis 
the reagan administration had only a brief comment on the latest 
development 
this action underscores the need for a dialogue between the 
government and the black opposition to bring about a fully 
functioning nonracial democracy said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
in tokyo the japanese government today criticized the extention 
and urged south africa to release political prisoners permit 
antiapartheid activities and talk with the opposition 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement in a 
statement from its headquarters in zambia said the government 
sought to ensure its survival by continuing to resort to the most 
brutal repression 
the anc called for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against 
south africa and said its guerrillas must escalate their attacks 
bothas announcement came two days after blacks ended their 
biggest and longest general strike against the whitecontrolled 
government black labor federations said today that about 2000 
workers who joined the protest have been fired and 1000 more 
subjected to various disciplinary actions 
the new emergency decree took effect immediately upon government 
publication new press restrictions will bar all media from quoting 
any member of an outlawed or restricted organization and require 
local news agencies to register with the government 
these domestic news agencies many of them aggressive in their 
coverage of antiapartheid activity could be ordered to submit all 
their dispatches to a government censor before publication the 
regulations say 
journalists are already restricted in coverage of unrest 
security force action treatment of emergency detainees and a wide 
range of political statements the government considers subversive 
another section gives the government power to extend the 
suspenions of two antiapartheid newspapers new nation and south 
which were closed down in recent months new nations editor 
zwelakhe sisulu has been detained without charge since december 
1986 
it is indeed the aspiration of the government that conditions 
will change to such an extent that the declared state of emergency 
can be lifted botha said in a statement 
we might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent state 
of emergency independent member of parliament jan van eck told a 
gathering in johannesburg on thursday a minority regime will not 
be able to govern this country without the very wide and very 
arbitrary powers afforded by the state of emergency 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
despite banning of apartheid groups and restrictions on their 
leaders more than 2 million blacks stayed away from work school 
and shops from monday to wednesday the strike was called to 
protest these restrictions and oppose labor legislation that could 
weaken black unions 
botha declared the nationwide emergency on june 12 1986 after 
two years of violence that claimed 1700 lives 
in february 17 antiapartheid organizations including the 
nationwide united democratic front coalition were banned from all 
political activity the two front presidents and treasurer the 
last executive members not in hiding or in detention were banned 
from giving speeches or news interviews 
about 40000 people including 10000 children have been 
detained during the past two years according to the nowbanned 
detainees parents support committee they estimate 2500 people are 
still in prison 
the government has refused to give definitive numbers of people 
in detention

treasure hunters have found hundreds of 
spanish gold coins on the ocean floor just off floridas coast 
according to one of the states most famous salvors 
they found it today this afternoon an excited mel fisher 
said thursday 
the key west salvor and a friend demostines mo molinar 
first found gold in the area on april fools day in 1964 
molinar who now works a lease held by fisher found 455 
twoescudo gold coins an eightescudo coin a gold brooch inlaid 
with diamonds and a golden lid to a jewelry box fisher said 
john brandon chief of operations at the site came up with 25 
oneescudo coins three dated lima coins seven fourescudo 
coins and two eightescudo coins 
on july 31 1715 a hurricane slammed into an 11ship spanish 
fleet in florida waters near vero beach and fort pierce now 
nicknamed the treasure coast the fleet reportedly was carrying 14 
million worth of gold silver and jewels from havana to spain some 
1000 people died 
spaniards and pirates salvaged some of the sunken ships but 
most of those efforts stopped by 1720 archive records show little 
thought was given the treasures until 1955 when retired builder 
kip wagner mounted a search after finding a piece of eight on a 
florida beach he eventually brought up about 1 million from four 
of the ships 
there are an estimated 5000 shipwrecks lying off floridas 
coasts some contain treasure from the wrecks of spanish fleets 
that traveled from the new world to spain between 1537 and 1778 
most including military vessels coastal passenger steamers and 
shrimp boats are virtually worthless to anyone but archaeologists 
and historians 
in 1985 after years of searching fisher found the mother lode 
from another spanish ship sunk by a hurricane off key west booty 
from the nuestra senora de atocha has been in the millions of

two vessels 
resembling iranian speedboats raced toward a convoy of us 
warships and kuwaiti tankers but veered off without attacking 
navy officials said friday 
the speedboats came within two miles of the two us warships 
and three usflagged kuwaiti oil carriers as they steamed 
thursday night through the strait of hormuz en route to the persian 
gulf the officials said 
nine other tankers at least two of them with philadelphia 
pa painted on their sterns tagged along with the convoy as it 
ran the gantlet of iranian missile batteries and gunboats in the 
strait 
the 36th us convoy of the year began its journey at the 
socalled kmart parking lot the convoy assembly area in the 
gulf of oman 
by the time the procession turned the corner past omans 
flashing didimar light in the strait it had swelled to at least 14 
ships according to officers aboard this 3880ton guided missile 
frigate which was taking part in its first escort mission since 
arriving in the gulf earler in the week 
the second escort was the 7810ton destroyer john hancock also 
a new arrival which recently accompanied another kuwaiti tanker 
down the gulf 
the two vessels that rushed the convoy were boston whalertype 
speedboats often used by iran to attack neutral shipping in the 
southern gulf 
each speedboat carried two crew members but there was no sign of 
weapons according to lt cmdr brad goforth a navy spokesman 
accompanying a pentagon news media pool aboard the fahrion 
they just wanted to see who we were said the frigates 
skipper cmdr thomas e plichta of charleston sc 
iran has carried out four gunboat raids on ships in the southern 
gulf since may 3 when a tougher us policy permitting american 
warships to intervene in attacks on nonus vessels went into 
effect in all four cases however no american ships were close 
enough to act 
the us convoy was one of the largest this year and the 57th 
since washington agreed a year ago to reflag 11 kuwaitiowned oil 
tankers and give them naval escort against iranian attack iran 
considers kuwait an ally of iraq irans enemy in the persian gulf 
war 
the convoy included the 295085ton middletown and the 
80000ton ocean city oil products tankers and the 48725ton 
liquefied gas carrier gas king 
tag alongs have become a regular feature of the american and 
european convoys in the gulf as merchant ships look for ways to 
shield themselves from iranian gunboat raids in the southern gulf 
and strait 
but rarely if ever has a convoy attracted as many as the nine 
hitchhikers that sailed in front behind and on both sides of the 
convoy friday

party chairman paul g kirk jr 
urged democratic platform writers today to not turn the partys 
election manifesto into a yellow pages listing of demands for 
every organized group 
as a 16member drafting committee opened work the party 
released a 2000word discussion paper penned by onetime john 
f kennedy speechwriter theodore sorensen even before it was made 
public the sorensen paper was drawing criticism from the campaigns 
of michael dukakis and jesse jackson as not specific enough 
the sorensen paper styled as a declaration by we the people 
of the democratic party denounces voodoo economics and 
condemns south africas hateful apartheid governmentsponsored 
terrorism 
jackson has said the platform must denounce south africa as a 
terrorist state 
kirk in an opening statement to the platform writers said the 
party needs a pragmatic principled and positive statement that 
american people can read and reflect upon and say thats the kind 
of country i want my kids to grow up in 
we have to not only speak to ourselves we have to remember 
the socalled swing voters where are they going to end up in 
november and where will their families end up in the 1990s kirk 
asked 
he told reporters as he departed that the sorensen paper was a 
starting point he said he did not think the party needs to spell 
out dollar figures or precise program goals in its platform 
i dont think well end up with the yellow pages an ad for 
every organized group he said 
at a welcoming party thursday night hosted by michigan gov 
james j blanchard at his summer residence on this resort island 
kirk said he did not expect showdown votes at this weekends 
drafting sessions 
michael barnes a former maryland congressman who is dukakis 
chief liaison with the platform committee said the differences 
between the two are not that great its not like jesse helms and 
george mcgovern were talking about two progressive democrats 
jackson has said repeatedly he wants the platform to feature 
specific planks including a denuncation of south africa as a 
terrorist state elimination of voter registration restrictions 
and a shift of resources from the military to social programs 
but it is a central theme of jacksons own campaign his promise 
to raise taxes on the wealthy that could cause the most discomfort 
for dukakis and party chieftains 
although dukakis commands a delegate majority jacksons 
24percent share of delegates is large enough to force a floor 
fight on any platform issues he chooses 
barnes told reporters that if jackson seeks to bring a minority 
report to the convention floor in atlanta favoring tax increases 
i can guarantee you it will be defeated 
the platform drafting committee is led by a jackson supporter 
rep william h gray iii of pennsylvania the chairman of the house 
budget committee barnes also said a working paper that kirk 
commissioned by theodore sorensen once john f kennedys 
speechwriter needed additional work 
democratic officials declined to make sorensens paper public 
thursday 
kirk said it is a very positive first step in the process 
embracing all of the fundamental beliefs of our party 
the party chief also said there is a reference to south africa 
and terrorism in the paper but did not elaborate 
i cant remember a time the partys been more unified we have 
a tremendous opportunity we see in our ranks common sense and a 
sense of common purpose said kirk 
the full 186member platform committee will not meet until june 
2526 in denver 
blanchard its chairman said in a recent interview he does not 
expect a finished product out of the deliberations on mackinac a 
sylvan retreat where horsedrawn wagons not cars ply the 
lilaclined roads 
i dont think well know what the platform really contains 
until were at atlanta probably but the sooner we can get a draft 
to everyone the more time we provide for discussion debate the 
better off well be blanchard said 
i think its going to be quite hardhitting and progressive on 
things like womens rights and civil rights and traditional things 
that we all feel strongly about said blanchard adding 
i would like a document that you could actually read at the 
democratic national convention and people would listen to and stay 
awake for

italy could be facing europes greatest aids threat 
because of its high percentage of aids victims who are drug 
abusers an official said friday at a medical conference 
researchers attending the fourday international drug abuse 
epidemiology conference in rome said drug abusers account for 64 
percent of the 1411 cases of aids reported in italy through the 
end of 1987 
donato greco an official with the istituto superiore di sanita 
in rome said the percentage is the highest of any country in the 
world 
greco said researchers have not determined why italy has a 
disproportionate concentration of aids cases among drug addicts 
there is reason to believe that needle injection is a more 
efficient means of transmission than sexual intercourse this is 
why even though our italian epidemic started later it is 
running at higher speeds than other countries greco said 
im sorry to say italy will be the leading aids country 
in europe due to this very effective means of transmission he 
said 
estimates for heroin addicts in italy range from 200000 to 
400000 
sharing contaminated needles is one of the most effective means 
to transmit acquired immune deficiency syndrome the aids virus 
attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to a 
wide variety of infections and cancers 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products aids can also be passed from mother to child at or 
before birth

american art is on display in a 
public cultural center here for the first time since marxist 
ethiopia became a staunch ally of the soviet union 11 years ago 
us charge daffaires james cheek opened the exhibit usa 
printworks selections from the brandywine workshop collections 
thursday night at the addis ababa city hall cultural center 
he said he hoped the art show would bring about a better 
understanding of american art and society and encourage more 
cultural exhanges between ethiopia and the united states 
the eightday show came to ethiopia after traveling extensively 
throughout other parts of africa latin american and asia it was 
sponsored by the us embassys public affairs office under the 
us governments cultural exchange program 
the brandywine workshop was opened in philadelphia penn in 
1972 by printer allan edmonds to provide access to sophisticated 
printing techniques for artists 
john burns the us embassys public affairs spokesman said 
friday his office sponsored an american art exhibition in ethiopia 
two years ago but it was held in the italian cultural center 
he said the current exhibit marks the first time an american art 
show has been held in a public cultural center in ethiopia since 
1977 when the government closed the us information service and 
the us military assistance and advisory group office 
until emperor haile selassie was overthrown in 1974 ethiopia 
was one of the wests staunchest allies the nation turned to the 
soviet union during its 197778 war with somalia over a region of 
eastern ethiopia inhabited by ethnic somalis known as the ogaden 
cheek said the collection of prints from the brandywine workshop 
collection were selected because they reflect the ethnic and 
stylistic diversity in american art 
among the 34 artists whose works are represented in the exhibit 
are richard hunt of chicago and sam gillian who was born in 
tupelo miss but works in the chicago area 
also represented in the show is jules olitski a sovietborn

the house ethics committee announced today 
that it has voted to start an official inquiry into the financial 
dealings of speaker jim wright 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the panel voted 
unanimously to probe six possible violations of the house rules 
last night the committee voted a preliminary 
investigation in the matter of speaker jim wright said dixon 
the speaker of the house has been notified and has pledged his 
full cooperation 
the six areas to be formally investigated by the committee 
include 
the circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts for a friend 
and constituent richard moncrief with whom wright had an interest 
in a private gas well venture 
the circumstances surrounding wrights intervention in a 
matter before the interior department on behalf of texas oil amp gas 
co 
whether campaign funds were used to help pay for publication 
of wrights book reflections of a public man from which he 
received a 55 percent royalty totaling some 55000 
whether wright improperly detailed a congressional aide and 
used his office expense accounts to complete work on the book 
wrights use of a condominium in fort worth texas which 
belongs to friend and business partner george mallick for which 
wright reportedly pays expenses but no rent 
the possible exercise of undue influence in dealings with 
officials of the federal home loan bank board on behalf of texas 
savings and loan institutions 
the committee authorized issuance of subpoenas for depositions 
and records in connection with the inquiry 
wright in advance of the committee announcement today released 
papers he said would refute charges that he violated ethics rules 
but the speaker said he still welcomed an official inquiry 
the committee properly wants to look very carefully and 
exhaustively into each of the items of which ive been accused 
said wright dtexas ultimately im certain that exposure to all 
the facts will assure the committee that there is no warrantable 
charge 
wright released an inchthick sheaf of papers with a statement 
saying they will demonstrate conclusively that my official 
conduct has not violated any rule of the house 
the papers included news stories letters between wright and 
past and present administration officials financial disclosure 
documents copies of bank checks and statements investment 
information and documents relating to a book he wrote 
thereve been so many innuendos so many planted stories so 
many reprints of stories that were inaccurate wright said that 
he had several times sought an inquiry in order to clear his name 
the ethics panel asked to investigate the speakers financial 
dealings met privately for nearly 8 hours on thursday in its 
second session on the topic 
when the committee broke its meeting at 1125 pm thursday the 
lawmakers refused to say if any decisions had been made the 
committee has been weighing whether to launch a formal inquiry 
what the scope of such an inquiry should be and whether to hire an 
outside counsel to handle any inquiry 
i am supremely confident when all of it is seen out on the 
table in the sunlight it will be absolutely clear to everyone 
that no house rules were violated wright told reporters on 
thursday he had written and planned to publicly release a 
narrative account explaining his actions he said 
the complaint against wright was filed by a political enemy 
rep newt gingrich rga common cause a nonprofit group which 
pushes for tighter government ethics standards also called for an 
investigation 
gingrichs complaint accused wright of improperly lobbying us 
officials and the late egyptian president anwar sadat on behalf of 
oilmen with whom he had financial relationships 
he also questioned the propriety of wrights receiving royalties 
at several times the standard rate for his book reflections of a 
public man which was published by a friend and campaign 
contractor 
news reports this week revealed that wright used one of his 
capitol hill staffers to help compile the book which earned him 
about 55000 
wright is using a current staffer to work on a new book project 
and gingrich has conceded that one of his aides worked on a book he 
wrote 
wrights supporters have called the charges a republican effort 
to deflect criticism of ethical lapses in the reagan administration 
and the current controversy surrounding attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
some democrats were known to oppose the republican request for 
an outside counsel to probe the speaker fearing it would aid the 
gop drive to equate the wright and meese cases in the public eye 
the ethics committee officially called the committee on 
standards of official conduct is the only house panel with equal 
representation of the two parties six democrats and six 
republicans

the presidential contenders comments are getting more pointed 
with republican george bush denouncing democrat michael dukakis for 
a flawed world view and the dukakis camp charging 
mudslinging but the democrats national chairman called today 
for a positive party platform 
paul kirk addressing democratic platform drafters on mackinac 
island mich said the party needs a pragmatic principled and 
positive statement that american people can read and reflect upon 
and say thats the kind of country i want my kids to grow up 
in 
as for the specifics that many groups are demanding the platform 
include he said i dont think well end up with the yellow 
pages an ad for every organized group 
meanwhile a pair of polls published today suggested the 
democratic ticket would be hurt if jesse jackson were dukakis 
running mate a usa todaycnn survey indicated dukakis has a clear 
lead over bush unless he picks jackson as his running mate and 
an abcwashington post poll suggested jacksons presence on the 
ticket would hurt dukakis among key groups whose backing he needs 
to win in november 
both bush and dukakis looked ready for a long hot summer leading 
up to their respective parties conventions although the 
postprimary preconvention period traditionally marks a lull in 
campaign activity the two rivals are indicating they wont wait 
for formal nominee status to begin their battle 
theres no reason to wait till the world series to start 
swinging said bush in texas to address delegates at the state 
gop convention on thursday this is a new ball game spring 
training is over 
the vice president criticized dukakis positions on a variety of 
topics saying the massachusetts governor would raise taxes plague 
innocent taxpayers with irs audits weaken national defense be 
soft on crime and put forth an isolationist foreign policy 
my opponent is an articulate defender of a flawed world 
view said bush his views and values are too often out of 
the mainstream 
dukakis campaign spokesman leslie dach said its clear that 
the vice president doesnt think his own record or vision can bring 
him the votes he needs in november 
given where george bush is in the polls i think its no 
surprise that hes chosen to spend his time mudslinging and tearing 
down dach said 
late thursday night on abctv bush engaged nightline anchor 
ted koppel in combative debate occasionally calling him dan in 
slips harking back to the vice presidents 9minute faceoff last 
january with cbs dan rather 
as rather had koppel questioned bush closely on his knowledge 
of the clandestine sales of us arms to iran bush said as he has 
repeatedly that he knew little of the arms dealing while it was 
going on 
in the midst of one pointed exchange koppel said to bush that 
i find your answer inconsistent 
well thats your opinion bush said you ask the 
questions but you dont like the answer what do you want me to 
say 
a series of recent nationwide polls suggested dukakis had the 
edge in a faceoff with bush with some surveys putting the lead in 
double digits 
the latest such survey the cnnusa today poll gave dukakis a 
6point lead over bush 45 percent to 39 percent 
dukakis became the certain democratic nominee on tuesday when 
the final four primaries of the season gave him the delegates he 
needs for a firstballot victory in atlanta bush put away his gop 
rivals months ago 
three of those former opponents kansas sen bob dole 
television evangelist pat robertson and rep jack kemp were 
joining bush at a republican unity conference today in denver 
and the atlanta constitution reported in todays editions that 
former dukakis rival tennessee sen albert gore jr is planning to 
endorse dukakis possibly during a dukakis campaign trip through 
the south next week 
jackson was out of public view on thursday resting up at the 
posh la costa resort outside san diego he held strategy meetings 
with about a dozen top aides to map out his next moves 
the abcwashington post survey published in todays editions of 
the post said jackson was the top choice of democrats as a dukakis 
running mate but that his presence on the ticket would badly erode 
dukakis support among southern democrats reagan democrats and 
independent voters 
and dukakis lead over bush in the usa todaycnn survey was 
reversed when jackson was added on as a running mate with jackson 
on the ticket dukakis 6point lead changed to a 7point deficit 
the posts poll of 656 democrats conducted may 1925 had a 
4point margin of error the usa today survey of 1253 registered 
voters was conducted june 69 and had a margin of error of 3 
percentage points 
the massachusetts governor attended a victory bash thursday 
night in boston he said he expected a tough and competitive 
campaign 
in other campaign developments 
california video magnate stuart karl was charged thursday with 
illegally funneling money to the campaigns of gary hart and other 
political candidates a federal grand jury indictment accuses karl 
of conspiracy false statementconcealment in a matter before a 
government agency making an illegal corporate contribution to a 
federal candidate making excessive contributions to a candidate 
and making a campaign contribution in the name of another 
dukakis wife kitty was released from massachusetts general

sweden the host of the fourth 
international conference on aids is campaigning against the deadly 
disease with the same matteroffact openness that marks its 
attitude toward sex 
swedes and other scandinavians discuss aids in schools make 
condoms easily available and in some places provide free 
hypodermic needles to drug addicts 
tests to detect exposure to the aids virus are free to military 
conscripts pregnant women and prison inmates volunteers can be 
tested at any psychiatric or venereal disease clinic 
scandinavias public education campaign aimed largely at 
teenagers is conducted with explicitness that might be startling 
in more conservative parts of the world 
even some danish tv viewers complained about one ad showing a 
woman slipping a codom on her partner the ad stressed that safe 
sex can be fun 
the scandinavian model for campaigning against aids will be one 
aspect of the conference beginning sunday it is drawing 6500 
experts from 125 countries to discuss scientific and social aspects 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
aids has hit denmark the hardest of the scandinavian countries 
afflicting 257 people and killing 134 of them authorities estimate 
that as many as 15000 danes are infected with the aidscausing hiv 
virus 
norways national health directorate has established a special 
aids unit to monitor the illness which has killed 48 of norways 
81 recorded aids victims another 688 norwegians are registered hiv 
carriers and an estimated 2500 others may have the virus 
an estimated 1839 swedes are known to carry the hiv virus the 
aids delegation a task force in swedens social ministry says 89 
swedes have died of the 192 who contracted the disease 
the scandinavians have had a reputation for sexual freedom since 
the 1967 swedish movie i am curious yellow brought nudity 
to legitimate filmmaking 
that image has been exaggerated by their lack of shyness about 
discussing sex and their lifestyles sexual experimentation among 
teenagers is accepted here 
marriage also has gone out of fashion 
only half the swedish couples who establish households go 
through a wedding ceremony and about half of swedish children are 
born to unwed parents but separation is about as common as divorce 
in other industrial countries the experts say 
in swedish schools where sex eductation begins in the preteen 
years students can obtain free condoms simply by asking the school 
nurse said brigitta hessulf of the aids campaign 
swedish authorities sent 4 million pamphlets to homes earlier 
this year to explain in graphic detail how the disease is 
transmitted she said 
the drug culture also is a campaign target danish addicts can 
anonymously obtain syringes from pharmacies and from dispensing 
machines in sweden a pilot program that will allow addicts to 
exchange used needles for new ones is nearly complete in the 
southern university town of lund 
in norway needles can be bought cheaply 
the education campaign has not been an unqualified success a 
survey of 4000 swedes published wednesday noted that 
misconceptions still are common it said 25 percent thought aids 
could be transmitted by insects even more than the 18 percent who 
believed they could catch aids by kissing 
but 27 percent said they had modified their sexual behavior 
because of aids compared with 11 percent in a poll two years ago 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

the senate passed legislation today that would 
permit the death penalty for drug dealers convicted of murder 
rejecting pleas that the measure would be a move toward reducing 
the civility of society 
the electionyear legislation was sent to the house on a 6529 
vote the bills fate is less certain in that chamber where the 
house judiciary committee which will consider it has been 
hostile to capital punishment legislation in the past 
murder is murder whether legal or illegal said sen dan 
evans rwash we are reducing the civility and the compassion of 
our society 
but sen alfonse damato rny the bills sponsor said i 
believe society has a right to say we are outraged at certain acts 
and the death penalty is the appropriate penalty in these cases 
before final passage lawmakers voted 6628 to set aside a 
provision by sen paul simon dill that would have limited the 
bills capital punishment provisions to drug dealers who are 
convicted of killing law enforcement officers 
on voice votes they accepted a provision that would allow 
prison employees to refuse to participate in executions and 
rejected language that would have required prisoners to be killed 
in public both measures were sponsored by sen mark hatfield 
rore 
on thursday the senate voted 6927 to shut off debate ending a 
filibuster by opponents who had stalled a vote 
im not saying the death penalty will eliminate the drug 
problem but i do think it will serve as a deterrent said 
damato 
but opponents decried the bill as electionyear politics saying 
it would do nothing to deter drug dealing and represented a cynical 
response to public demands to do something about illegal drugs 
evans referred to a similar bill proposed in 1986 and said 
once again were going for an electionyear slam dunk on drugs 
were taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political 
vanity 
the damato bill provides that the death penalty can be imposed 
on people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug 
ring and who are then separately convicted of killing law 
enforcement officers or private citizens 
many states including those with severe drug problems already 
have the death penalty and it hasnt had much deterrent effect 
opponents of the bill said 
before invoking cloture the senate voted 6531 against an 
amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment 
without parole instead of the death penalty for people convicted 
under the terms of damatos bill 
damatos proposal was originally attached as an amendment to 
the pentagon budget bill but opponents filibustered and damato 
withdrew his proposal in return for a promise by senate leaders to 
give him a vote on a separate bill 
supporters said the death penalty would deter drug kingpins 
sen phil gramm rtexas said to go on talking about a war 
on drugs and not commit ourselves to a death penalty for those who 
kill our law enforcement officers in that war is to make a mockery 
of saying we have a war on drugs 
but sen paul simon dill said the evidence that the death 
penalty is a deterrent is just not there at all 
sen edward m kennedy dmass added that the death penalty 
provision could lead to the execution of innocent people he cited 
a stanford university study which said 350 people have been 
convicted of capital offenses in this century and then later found 
to be innocent 
sen orrin hatch rutah responded that there are enough 
safeguards in the legal system to protect innocent persons 
nobody should be able to kill our policemen without paying the 
ultimate price he said 
also thursday the house banking committee approved legislation 
to make it more difficult for drug dealers and other criminals to 
hide their profits the bill would require banks to file 
transaction reports with the government for all cashiers checks 
money orders and travelers checks of 3000 or more now banks 
need to file such reports on transactions of 10000 or more 
new york mayor edward i koch meanwhile was proposing the 
creation of tent jails in nevada to incarcerate convicted drug 
offenders and relieve prison overcrowding elsewhere 
in an appearance before two house armed services subcommittees 
koch conceded that nevada probably wouldnt think much of his idea

american prisoners of war still in the country 
the alaska republican made the request in a meeting in new york 
with vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach who is attending 
a special un general assembly session on disarmament 
i was very pleased with the response said murkowski it 
was a very positive one he said the suggestion was very 
appropriate and would address it upon his return to hanoi 
murkowski is a member of the senate veterans affairs committee 
we have also contacted the international committee of the red 
cross and they have indicated receptiveness to cooperating 
murkowski told the associated press by telephone from washington 
where he had returned later in the morning 
vietnams un ambassador trinh xuan lang also attended the 
meeting 
murkowski said the cooperative attitude of the vietnamese was 
encourging in light of next weeks scheduled meeting of the senate 
foreign relations committee to consider the possibility of america 
and vietnam establishing interest sections in each others 
countries 
vietnam and america do not have diplomatic relations 
i proposed to the foreign minister my conviction that until 
the suspicion and doubt is removed on the miapow issues its 
going to be difficult to make headway said murkowski 
i suggested it is time to invite the icrc to come into vietnam 
and examine the area intensely and satisfy themselves and issue a 
report 
a total of 2400 americans are listed as missing in indochina as 
a result of the vietnam war of that number 1762 are listed as 
missing in vietnam 
all told the remains of 156 americans have been repatriated to 
the united states and subsequently identified by the laboratory 
since the end of the war 
on wednesday thach met retired gen john vessey at the us 
mission to discuss americans missing in action 
us officials said they could give no details of the meeting 
 
vessey is president reagans special envoy to vietnam on 
prisoners of war mias reeducation camp inmates and other 
questions he and thach have met in vietnam and agreed to work 
toward solution of problems left over from the war

natan sharansky who spent nine years in soviet 
labor camps and prisons says president reagan in his recent visit 
to moscow made the same mistake that many westerners do 
reagan during his summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev accepted simple explanations for complex problems 
sharansky said at a news conference thursday 
they the west prefer to analyze the soviet union in terms of 
black and white sharansky said probably reagan fell into the 
same trap 
for example by saying some of the problems in the soviet union 
are the result of government bureaucracy sharansky said reagan 
wrongly accepts that the soviet system is like the western 
system 
though acknowledging that some reforms such as increased press 
freedom are taking place sharanksy said he doubted that real 
progress would be made in human rights because the concept runs 
counter to the soviet system 
the reforms are interesting exciting but they are not 
changing the principles of the system sharansky said 
the soviet way of life says that individuals cannot decide for 
themselves what to say where to go or what to believe in 
sharansky said he described glasnost gorbachevs program to 
create a more open society as only a new set of instructions 
sharansky who is on a tour to promote his new autobiography 
fear no evil commented during a news conference prior to his 
lecture at an atlanta synagogue 
sharansky was arrested in 1977 and charged with espionage and 
treason for his efforts on behalf of soviet jews seeking emigration 
to israel he was freed and joined his wife in israel in 1986 
he said an indication of how little progress has been made in 
human rights is that many of the prisoners he wrote about in his 
book are still locked up under the same conditions as before the 
gorbachev era

willis swint usually strolls behind his feed 
store every morning to measure rainfall but he hasnt done that 
much lately in this droughtstricken area 
in fact until thunderstorms rumbled through the area thursday 
there hadnt been any rain to measure in two weeks 
we measured a quarter of an inch swint said friday it 
helped a little bit 
if we know there are no visible signs of rain we dont go 
back there said swint 59 an official rain watcher for the 
national weather service for 38 years in jonesboro just south of 
atlanta before he started his father had measured rainfall since 
1940 
swint said jonesboros monthly rainfall totals since 1941 are 
recorded on one big cardboard sheet that hangs in his feed 
store he also keeps a daily record which he mails to the weather 
service in atlanta each month 
the jonesboro area is close to being short one years worth of 
rain he said 
swint said the area was 64 inches short on rainfall for the 
year through may and was short a total of 3421 inches for the 
previous four years that means jonesboro which usually gets 5030 
inches of rain in a year is missing 4061 inches for the 4year 
period through may he said 
we just had an inch and 94 hundredths of rain in may so 
its pretty dry 
much of northern georgia is dry officials from atlanta and six 
metropolitan counties agreed thursday to adopt a uniform set of 
outdoor watering regulations to conserve water state natural 
resources commissioner leonard ledbetter said the agency probably 
will have to ban all outdoor watering and begin water rationing 
unless there is substantial rainfall in the area in the next two or 
three weeks 
a committee of representatives from georgia florida and alabama 
decided thursday to recommend that barge traffic on the lower 
chattahoochee river and the apalachicola river in florida be 
restricted because of low water the corps of engineers warned that 
barge traffic may have to be suspended altogether next month 
swint said the area could catch up on some of its rainfall 
deficits this month if it gets an average june rainfall of 371 
inches 
if we just got the average wed still catch up he said 
these four years in a row is whats really hurt thats hurt the 
moisture way down in the ground you see 
swint said there have been drier years than this one namely 
1954 1981 and 1986 so water demand plays more of a role in this 
seasons drought than rainfall 
in 1986 through may we were about twice as short then as 
it is now he said theres more demand for water now 
but the early conservation efforts being implemented by local 
governments are helping swint said 
authorities are trying not to wait until they get to the last 
dipperful to start conserving he said thats my thinking on 
it anyway

dominos pizza incs policy of requiring male 
employees to keep their hair cut above the collar is discriminatory 
because women are permitted to have long hair a lawsuit filed 
against the pizza chain says 
the wayne county circuit court lawsuit was filed thursday by 
michael pitt an attorney appointed by the american civil liberties 
union to represent scott bedker 17 of st clair shores bedker 
was told in january that he must cut his shoulderlength hair or 
lose his job 
the suit names rpm inc the franchisee dominos the parent 
company and owner thomas monaghan it seeks to get bedkers job 
back and end the companys policy about hair 
pitt said bedkers hair in january was shoulderlength and 
wellgroomed the style he had when he was hired in november 1986 
bedker was told when hired to wear a cap with his hair folded under 
for sanitary reasons women in similar jobs were instructed to 
treat their hair the same way pitt said 
but in january 1988 when the edict from mr monaghan came down 
that men had to cut their hair there was no similar edict for 
women pitt said scott was subject to different work standards 
because of his sex 
bedker who recently graduated from high school remains 
unemployed and wants his job back at dominos where he made pizzas 
and answered phones pitt said 
ron hingst dominos national director of public relations said 
company attorneys hadnt seen the lawsuit and wouldnt comment but

some european governments are easing their 
pressure on libya and thereby encouraging its leader moammar 
gadhafi to resume his international terror campaign the top us 
counterterrorism official said friday 
ambassador l paul bremer told a congressional hearing that at 
the forthcoming sevennation economic summit in toronto the united 
states would stress to its allies the need to continue the 
international isolation against gadhafi 
evidence has emerged indicating that some european governments 
are weakening their resolve to keep the pressure on libya bremer 
said in remarks prepared for testimony before the senate 
appropriations committee 
he did not elaborate but us officials have noted that 
european oil companies recently have renewed their exploration 
projects in libya and that british business executives have 
returned to live there 
we know the governments cant control private business but 
these kind of actions realy send gadhafi the wrong signal said 
one official who spoke only on condition he not be named 
the number of terrorist attacks in 1988 is up significantly 
from 1987 bremer said we are deeply concerned by an upsurge in 
iranian terrorism and recent evidence that libya is becoming more 
active as a sponsor of terrorism 
although libyan sponsorship of terrorism declined sharply after 
the us air raid on libya in april 1986 and the western economic 
sanctions imposed that year libyan agents and surrogates are 
active throughout the world bremer said the surrogates include 
the japanese red army and the palestinian abu nidal group which is 
based in the libyan capital of tripoli he said 
the leaders of the worlds major industrialized countries 
pledged last year at their summit in venice italy to combat 
terrorism 
we expect our friends and allies to live up to that commitment 
and will advocate this in toronto bremer said 
other us officials say the summitteers probably will focus 
their discussions on efforts to secure international aviation 
against terrorism they say several paragraphs on the subject will 
be included in a joint political communique to be issued during the 
summit which takes place june 1921 
the question of air safety has become particularly pressing in 
view of several recent hijackings and bombings notably north 
koreas bombing of a korean airlines jet last year in which 115 
people were killed 
us officials are concerned that north korea may try to disrupt 
the olympic games in seoul south korea in september bremer said 
the united states has been providing training and sharing 
intelligence with south korea and other governments to reduce the 
chance of such attacks he said 
to help prevent a terrorist incident either at or en route to 
the seoul olympics the united states and south korea are 
cohosting a regional aviation security conference at the end of 
this month in seoul he said

charge and a oneyear concurrent term for the tax evasion charge 
sandefers plea bargain with federal prosecutors didnt include 
a condition that he not seek office when his sentence is completed

fines 
according to authorities the former sheriff received 500

former tennessee gov lamar alexander ready 
to step into new duties as a university president says hes an 
unlikely choice for the no 2 spot on the national republican 
ticket but hes willing to change his plans if george bush asks 
like everyone else on the veep lists alexander says he isnt 
seeking the job but hes thought about the possibility and is 
frank in his assessment 
its hard to want impossible to seek and virtually 
impossible to turn down 
alexander has had time to think about such matters 
the day after leaving the governors office in 1986 he and his 
family his wife honey and four children packed up and moved to 
australia for six months the kids went to school and alexander 
just hung out thinking 
people couldnt believe it the others are running for 
president and youre running for the other side of the world he 
said i just went to be there with my family and think about what 
i wanted to do next 
he has written a book about the hiatus called six months 
off it is being published this summer 
alexander a twoterm governor who emphasized education during 
his administration is well known to his fellow governors 
including michael dukakis of massachusetts the likely democratic 
presidential nominee 
hes often mentioned among the potential vice presidential 
running mates for bush who has consulted with alexander while 
trying to fill out the programs to back his oftstated goal of 
becoming the education president 
alexanders terms as governor and his stint as chairman of the 
national governors association were marked by activism he 
acknowledges the contrast with republicanled efforts to reduce 
government on the national level but says states must step into 
the gap 
ive tried to be a preacher of the rest of the republican 
message he said 
ive always believed many southern republicans have gotten so 
fascinated with the washington message which is usually put the 
harness on government theyve forgotten the rest of the republican 
message which is what needs to be done ought to be done locally 
alexander said thats sort of been my philosophy and its been 
very activist 
alexander recently was named president of the university of 
tennessee and he begins his new job july 1 two days before he 
turns 48 although he told university trustees he was leaving 
partisan politics behind he also told them the vice presidency was 
a possibility that he couldnt turn down 
if i were asked i would accept it alexander said in a 
recent interview recounting what he told the university officials 
i genuinely dont expect it i think its an extremely remote 
possibility he said i think almost anybody who was asked 
would accept it 
two years ago dukakis was picked the most effective governor in 
a survey of governors by newsweek magazine secondplace finisher 
in that balloting was alexander although twothirds of the 
governors at that time were democrats 
a former democratic governor charles robb of virginia 
acknowledged alexanders return from australia last summer we 
all hoped that he would stay there he makes democrats nervous 
a lawyer he got his start in politics working for howard baker 
then a senator from tennessee and he worked as an aide in the 
nixon white house he ran for governor in 1974 and lost but won 
four years later and became the first tennessean to serve eight 
consecutive years in the office

most south koreans reacted with anger 
friday to plans by radical students to march to communist north 
korea for unification talks the critics included some who backed 
prodemocracy riots last summer 
i supported them when they fought for democracy last year but 
this time i simply dont understand them said the owner of a 
small bakery near yonsei university in seoul where thousands of 
students battled riot police 
coughing and sneezing in his bakery filled with drifting tear 
gas he termed reunification a stupid idea and called the 
students simply crazy 
students are not politicians such contact should be made in 
an orderly manner through the government said the shopkeeper 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
few south koreans support or sympathize with the radical 
students call for talks with north korean students to reunite the 
peninsula which was divided at the end of world war ii 
let them go to the north and live there for a few months they 
need to learn by experience what is good and bad said chung 
soonim a 38yearold homemaker 
a uniformed army captain interviewed in a subway said i would 
like to shoot them they are too naive or idiots 
president roh taewoo who took office feb 25 after elections 
in december has liberalized debate on unification but said the 
government not students should lead any dialogue with north korea 
south korean students traditionally a major political force 
played a key role in nationwide public protests last summer that 
led to sweeping democratic reforms including direct presidential 
elections 
the radical students are a very small but loud minority 
government officials say they account for just 2 percent to 3 
percent of the countrys 1 million students about 41 million 
people live in south korea 
i do agree that the students have the right to meet their 
north korean friends it would help ease the bitter rivalry between 
the two sides dissident buddhist monk song kwan said after a 
rally at yonsei university on friday 
another dissident leader moon ikhwan told students at the 
rally the roh taewoo regime has neither capability nor will to 
push national unification i support the student talks 
about 4000 students clenched fists in the air rose in wild 
cheers and sang a song titled our lifelong wish is unification 
they demanded permission to march to the border village of 
panmunjom for the unification talks south korea banned the march 
as a national security threat 
the students are also demanding that north korea be a cohost of 
septembers olympic games in seoul as a step toward reunification 
and that the 42000 us troops stationed in south korea withdraw 
many intellectuals have said the activism could backfire they 
point out that the military staged a coup in 1961 after radical 
students called for similar unification talks with north korea

a physician who felled 24 trees on 
federal property to improve the view of a lake must pay 7500 in 
restitution and provide free emergency medical treatment to lake 
visitors a judge ruled 
kenneth abbott of smithville was charged thursday with timber 
trespass by us magistrate joe haynes in a petty offense 
citation 
abbott a radiologist was also ordered to pay a 500 fine 
this man showed a blatant disregard for the rights of the 
public in general said assistant us attorney bob washko 
several of the trees abbott chopped down were more than 100 feet 
tall washko said 
there was nothing malicious about it he was simply oblivious 
to the harm he did to erosion control to wildlife and to the 
beauty of the area itself said washko and it was all because 
he wanted a better view of the lake from his home 
the 24 trees which stood on federal property in woods 
separating abbotts clifftop home from a lake included 13 red 
maples 6 hickory trees 4 chestnut oaks and 1 yellow poplar 
the corps of engineers initiated an investigation after rangers 
notified them that trees were missing 
haynes called the damage done by abbott irreparable and 
ordered him to provide two years of free emergency medical 
treatment for visitors to the lake

a former prosecutor testified today that us 
district judge walter j nixon entered into a sweetheart deal 
with a wealthy mississippi investor that led to the judges 
conviction and imprisonment for lying to a federal grand jury 
attorney reid weingarten who was the prosecutor at nixons 
trial told a house impeachment panel that the judge bought three 
oil well properties from wiley fairchild for 9500 in 1980 and 
netted more than 50000 from the deal 
it was obviously a freebie a sweetheart deal said 
weingarten who quoted nixon as telling fairchild that if i can 
help you i will and if i cant ill tell you 
the judge was accused of trying subsequently to get favorable 
treatment for fairchilds son drew in a drug smuggling case 
nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity in the oil 
drilling transaction with fairchild but was convicted in february 
1986 of lying to a grand jury when he denied discussing drew 
fairchilds case with fairchilds father and a mississippi 
prosecutor 
the supreme court denied nixons appeal last january and the 
judge began serving a fiveyear sentence at a minimumsecurity 
federal prison at eglin air force base fla on march 23 he 
continues to draw his 89500 annual salary while in prison 
nixon who listened quietly to weingartens testimony today 
told house judiciary subcommittee investigators thursday that 
justice will prevail and my innocence will be understood and 
that he should not be impeached for his perjury conviction 
if impeached by the full house and convicted at a senate trial 
nixon 59 would be removed from the federal bench where he has 
served since 1968 
it is a natural reaction nixon said to think that someone 
who is in prison should not be a federal judge 
i agree that something is wrong with this situation but what 
is wrong is that i am in prison even though i have committed no 
crime nixon said in his opening statement if i believed for a 
moment that i had committed a crime i would have resigned as a 
judge and this hearing would not be necessary 
nixon told the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights he had done nothing to call into question 
the integrity of the bench 
my loving family and i have lost a great deal over the last 
several years our peace of mind damage to my reputation and now 
my freedom he said but we have not lost faith that in the 
end justice will prevail and my innocence will be understood and 
recognized 
nixon has been a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge for 
mississippis southern district since 1982 he would forfeit his 
annual salary of 89500 and his eligibility for a pension at age 
65 if he is impeached by the house and removed from office by the 
senate 
he is the third federal judge to be indicted on charges of 
crimes allegedly committed while in office 
us district judge alcee hastings of florida was acquitted of 
bribery in 1983 and impeachment hearings ended in that case 
thursday former federal judge harry claiborne of nevada was 
convicted in 1984 of failing to report 106000 on his federal 
income tax returns and was sentenced to two years in prison he was 
impeached and removed from office in 1986 
nixons legal problems stemmed from his business relationship 
with fairchild nixon has testified that his purchase of oil and 
gas rights in three wells was a legitimate transaction and that he 
promised no favors to fairchild in return 
in march a group of judges that makes policy for the federal 
courts urged that the house consider impeaching nixon a few days 
later an impeachment resolution was introduced in the house 
during thursdays hearing the subcommittee members heard tape 
recordings of an interview federal authorities had with nixon in 
april 1984 when they were investigating the case and of his july 
1984 testimony to the grand jury

trying to fight their way through 
about 60000 riot police blanketed the south korean capital and 
roads leading north to disperse students trying to reach the border 
30 miles away fierce street clashes erupted at yonsei university 
as about 5000 screaming students tried to fight their way out 
an estimated 8000 troopers surrounding the school fired 
hundreds of tear gas bombs into the charging students both sides

responsibility for the failure of the talks rests entirely with the 
us imperialists and the south korean rulers 
police and press reports indicated at least 700 students were 
arrested in various parts of south korea most detainees were 
expected to be held briefly 
radical students who government officials say account for just 
2 percent to 3 percent of the nations 1 million students called 
the march to force reunification of the communist north and the 
prowestern south 
the radicals claim the united states which has 42000 troops in 
south korea enforces partition to rule the south the protests 
were vehemently antiamerican 
lets go and meet our brothers from the north the students 
at yonsei yelled beating drums and singing revolutionary songs 
yankee go home yelled others skin the yankee imperialists 
we call for struggle of the masses for unification and against 
dictatorship a speaker shouted as students cheered 
riot troopers hit by firebombs screamed in agony as other 
officers frantically beat out the flames students wielding clubs 
attacked police who tried to ward off blows with riot shields 
a dozen armored police vans with multiple tear gas launchers 
fired barrages of gas bombs to hold back attacking protesters as 
police martial arts squads attacked students tried to immobilize

buildings and us diplomatic facilities to prevent attacks 
many onlookers criticized the protesters saying they were 
leftists or fools who would help the communist north conquer the 
south 
let them go to the north and live there for a few months 
said chung soonim a 38yearold homemaker they need to learn 
by experience what is good and bad 
a uniformed army captain said i would like to shoot them 
they are too naive or idiots 
most south koreans want reunification with the north but fear 
the north is determined eventually to conquer the south 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 to launch the korean war 
and the two nations remain bitter enemies with no ties or contacts 
the radicals a small but powerful minority on campuses deny 
they are communists and insist reunfication overrides ideological

local and international laws against terrorism mandate a trial for 
kim who acknowledged her role in the bombing of the korean air

games the reports said a record 161 countries are scheduled to

in a case that echoed the rough sex 
defense of the preppie killing trial a teenager who strangled 
his girlfriend was sentenced today to up to four years in prison 
the most he could have received 
joseph porto 19 had been found guilty of criminally negligent 
homicide in the death of kathleen holland 17 whom he said he 
strangled in a sex act gone awry 
in sentencing porto to one and onethird to four years in 
prison nassau county court judge john thorp jr said the 
punishment does not fit the crime 
portos attorney barry slotnick who represented subway gunman 
bernhard goetz had asked the judge to give his client probation 
he later called the sentence excessive and said he would seek to 
have the verdict and sentence overturned 
porto showed no outward sign of emotion when the sentence was 
announced 
in asking for the maximum sentence prosectutor kenneth littman 
said the probation report paints a picture of a selfcentered 
arrogant and spoiled young man who acts impulsively and 
aggressively toward young women 
he said officers detected no remorse in porto and in fact said 
porto smirked during the entire interview with probation 
officers 
porto of bayville was charged with seconddegree murder after 
he confessed in writing and on videotape to strangling miss holland 
on sept 27 1986 when she tried to end their ninemonth 
relationship 
in his confession porto said he used his hands and a high 
school graduation tassel to choke the teenager to death he 
recanted the confession during his april trial and like the 
preppie killing defendant robert chambers said miss holland 
died accidentally while they were having sex 
porto told the jury he tied a rope around miss hollands neck to 
heighten her sexual pleasure and apparently yanked too hard in the 
heat of passion 
the jury acquitted him of murder and manslaughter charges while 
finding him guilty of the lesser charge 
portos defense was offered shortly after chambers who was 
charged with murdering teenager jennifer levin during a 1986 
sexual tryst in central park claimed he accidentally killed her 
during rough sex 
chambers interrupted his trial and pleaded guilty to a lesser 
charge of firstdegree manslaughter

wheelchairbound youngsters cut a red 
ribbon friday to dedicate a special playground designed to let them 
play sidebyside with children who arent disabled 
about 40 eager children many in wheelchairs made a beeline 
for the playground for all children and climbed on the 
equipment for the first time at the ceremony at holmes elementary 
school in this suburb west of chicago 
im excited to play in it because it looks fun and 
interesting said david hyde a 6thgrader who suffers from 
muscular dystrophy before i would just sit around and watch 
there was nothing else to do 
it was pure joy for the children said myra laroque 
president of the local parentteachers organization they were 
able to stand on it walk on it feel that it was real 
representatives of the village park district and school board 
addressed a crowd of about 200 at the halfhour ceremony 
the response by the community as a whole was excellent 
the enthusiasm the kids showed for the project was great mrs 
laroque said 
the 75by140 foot playground features an extensive ramp system 
for wheelchairbound children leading to a large platform with 
access to four slides and a large sandbox 
the ramp is designed to be therapeutic to help kids develop 
upper body strength the sandbox is raised to lap height so 
children can wheel right up and stick their hands in they can also 
slide into it 
and the swings have specially adapted mesh hammock seats that 
can be slipped under a child in a wheelchair 
the playground also has an herb garden for blind children to 
develop their senses of touch and smell and plantboxes for 
students to cultivate 
about 10 percent of the approximately 500 students at holmes are 
wheelchairbound said mrs laroque the school offers special 
programs for physically disabled children from oak park and 
neighboring suburbs 
these children are 100 percent integrated in the classroom 
but notable differences appear when they go outside to play said 
mrs laroque 
the pto decided about 2 years ago to develop the playround 
we wanted them to be accepted as individuals not ostracized 
or put aside as would happen in normal life said elaine sherman 
the playground committee cochairperson 
architect richard katz who had experience designing 
playgrounds found the project a great challenge 
he adapted some standard equipment and used his imagination 
about half of the 100000 budget came from federal community 
development funds allocated by oak park authorities the rest came 
from the local park and school districts and the parents 
fundraising efforts 
the playground dedicated on the last day of school at holmes 
will be open to the public workers are still putting finishing 
touches on the equipment which should open officially by the end 
of the month mrs laroque said

major elements are coming together 
for the first space shuttle mission in 2 years but critical 
milestones lie ahead on the road to an august launch shuttle 
officials reported friday 
the august target is optimistic for sure but given where we 
are today weve got a shot at it launch director bob sieck said 
were getting close and theres a feeling of excitement 
here said astronaut bob crippen deputy director of shuttle 
operations who will make the final decision on whether discovery 
is launched on the first postchallenger mission now set for aug 
31 
sieck and crippen addressed a news conference on the day two 
major parts for the discovery flight were joined in an assembly 
building the huge external fuel tank and the two solid fuel 
booster rockets 
engineers next week will complete a major overhaul job on 
discovery and will mate the spacecraft with the tank and boosters 
transfer of the spaceship to the launch pad is set for june 25 
that will be the most tangible evidence to us that a launch is 
near sieck said 
a key test is set for july 18 when discoverys three main liquid 
fuel engines are fired with the shuttle bolted firmly to the pad 
the 20second ignition will evaluate modifications made to the 
power plant and provide countdown experience for the launch team 
full scale test firings of the redesigned solid fuel booster 
rockets are scheduled for next tuesday and on july 26 at the morton 
thiokol plant in utah 
all three tests must be completed successfully and evaluated 
before discovery can be committed to flight 
well get through these milestones and then well look at the 
launch date sieck said 
a faulty joint in one of the 126foot booster rockets allowed 
flame to escape and destroy challenger and its sevenperson crew in 
a fiery explosion on jan 28 1986 
crippen said that once the tests are complete and a firm date 
has been set national aeronautics and space administration 
officials must clear another major hurdle a flight readiness 
review scheduled two weeks before liftoff 
that meeting will be the culmination of many earlier meetings 
and decisions and will decide if we are ready to fly crippen 
said 
two days before launch crippens mission management team will 
convene to evaluate weather hardware software and other elements 
and decide whether the final countdown should start 
at nine minutes before liftoff with a planned hold called for 
in the count crippen will call for a gonogo decisions from sieck 
and other officials

pop musics biggest names give a 10hour rock 
concert saturday honoring jailed black south african leader nelson 
mandela the event kicks off a fiveweek antiapartheid campaign 
in britain 
the concert signals a resurgence here of the campaign against 
white rule in south africa but it has been attacked by 
rightwingers who claim that by televising it the british 
broadcasting corp is violating its duty to be impartial 
south africa has denounced the wembley stadium concert expected 
to draw 72000 spectators it launches a series of rallies and 
birthday celebrations in britain leading up to mandelas 70th 
birthday july 18 
modeled on the 1985 live aid music extravaganza for african 
famine relief the concert will be broadcast live on television and 
radio in britain by the bbc and beamed to about 60 countries 
including the united states and soviet union 
mandela leader of the outlawed african national congress has 
served 25 years of a life sentence for plotting the overthrow of 
the south african government 
the publicly funded bbc has rejected allegations that it is 
implicitly backing the anc the main guerrilla group fighting south 
africas government 
anc president oliver tambo is billed as the concerts guest of 
honor but the bbc says it is not paying for broadcast rights and 
views the concert purely as an outstanding international musical 
event 
the antiapartheid movement says half the proceeds from the 50 
tickets will go to childrens charities in southern africa and the 
rest will fund its activities in britain 
you can only say it is a political event because he mandela 
is a political prisoner the movements president archbishop 
trevor huddleston said friday 
the rightwing freedom association claimed cash from the concert 
would finance what it termed terrorist actions by the anc the 
bbc governors must now have on their conscience the responsibility 
for the future deaths of innocent men women and children from the 
proceeds of a pop concert it said 
south africa said its london embassy complained to the bbc at 
the highest level for broadcasting the concert and it also 
attacked a bbc documentary screened wednesday night in which black 
south african children alleged they were tortured by police 
twentyfive lawmakers in the governing conservative party signed 
a house of commons motion complaining that the bbc was violating 
its rules by giving publicity to a movement that encourages the 
african national congress in its terrorist activities 
the south african embassy placed an advertisement in four 
british newspapers on friday headlined nelson mandela could be 
free which incorporated president pw bothas offer on jan 31 
1985 to release mandela if he renounced violence 
the ad also repeated mandelas reported response as quoted in 
an interview with the washington times on aug 22 1985 there is 
no alternative to taking up arms there is no room for peaceful 
struggle 
six hours of the concert will be telecast in the united states 
by fox broadcasting the los angelesbased network 
scheduled performers include whitney houston sting george 
michael miriam makeba hugh masekela dire straits eurythmics 
simple minds roberta flack natalie cole phil collins the bee 
gees joe cocker the fat boys maxi priest 
other bigname surprise performers are promised 
on sunday a freedom march across britain will begin in 
glasgow scotland winding up with a rally in londons hyde park on

gov roy romer today recommended that a permit be 
issued to build the 500 million two forks dam and reservoir but 
he attached a slew of conditions and said the project should be 
built only as a last resort 
the us army corps of engineers has the final say in issuing 
the permit for the project which has been proposed by the denver 
water board and a group called metro water providers a consortium 
of 42 denverarea water providers and municipalities 
col steve g west district engineer for the army corps of 
engineers said the governors recommendation will be one of many 
factors considered in deciding whether the project is in the public 
interest 
two forks would be built just downstream from the confluence of 
the south platte river and its north fork about 25 miles southwest 
of denver it would flood 20 miles of scenic cheesman canyon a 
prospect that has upset environmentalists and sportsmen 
colorado should build two forks in my judgment only as a 
last resort the governor told a packed news conference at the 
state capitol he added that he believes it has only a 5050 chance 
of being constructed even with his approval of the permit 
i am challenging the state to find an alternate solution and i 
think i can romer said 
denver officials say two forks would add 98000 acrefeet of 
water to the citys water system enough to meet denvers water 
needs through the year 2035 
project planners say two forks 615foothigh dam and reservoir 
would take two years to design and five years to build meaning it 
would be usable in 1995 at the earliest 
proponents have painted the project as crucial to the 
metropolitan areas growth opponents say it would needlessly wipe 
out 20 miles of gold medal trout fishing and nearby recreation 
areas and would pose a threat to whooping crane habitat and 
irrigators along the platte river in nebraska 
romer said he wants to save cheesman canyon and possibly make it 
a state recreational area but in order to do so he said his 
favored alternative a dam and reservoir west of the two forks 
site may have to be be built flooding the town of bailey 
there is a cost in saving the canyon the cost is in moving 
bailey romer said 
the governor said he would recommend a 25year shelf life for 
the project meaning it could be built anytime during that period 
but he attached conditions to his approval of the permit a 
metropolitanarea water conservation program creation of a 
metropolitan water authority to plan distribution of water supplies 
in the denver area a requirement that metro water providers share 
existing water supplies and full implementation of a mitigation 
plan to replace wildlife habitat and recreational facilities if two 
forks is ever built

commercial billboards with educational 
messages are springing up in schools around the country in a free 
program praised by some educators as creative and criticized by 
others as exploitative 
ads for cocacola maybelline snickers and other products run 
across the bottom of the billboards up to 6by4foot which 
carry educational messages on topics ranging from physical fitness 
to the us constitution 
they brighten up our school which is overall beige said 
jennifer knight editor of the student newspaper at rosemount high 
school in a st paul suburb 
ms knight said she saw nothing wrong with posters bearing a 
commercial message but noted that there were some posters in 
which i thought the advertising was more the focus than what it 
was trying to get at 
but jeanne m anderson a firstgrade teacher in white bear 
lake said she and other teachers persuaded their principal to bar 
them from their elementary school 
i dont see any value with these things with the ads displayed 
so blatantly she said in a recent interview whats next do 
we start sending coupons home with them 
the posters have been distributed to secondary schools for three 
years and to elementary schools since last fall by whittle 
communications said donna cheek a spokeswoman for the knoxville 
tennbased company 
the posters accompanied by teaching guides are displayed in 
about 9000 schools in about 40 states including more than 70 
schools in the minneapolis area the company estimates the posters 
are called connections in secondary schools and the big 
picture in elementary schools 
the big picture posters featuring young celebrities and 
other children are paid for by the advertisers said ed winter a 
whittle division president and publisher of the big picture 
the company declined to say how much it earns from distribution of 
the billboards 
the billboards winter said are no different from newspapers 
and magazines that contain advertising and are available in most 
school libraries 
the posters have won commendations for their educational value 
cheek emphasized in may she said connections received an 
award from the educational press association of america for an 
issue last fall focusing on the us constitution 
reaction to the program ranges from acceptance to anger 
ive never found anything offensive said assistant 
principal john holliday at rosemount high school the kids in 
them are typical of what we have in school here the role models 
are good 
at tartan high school in the st paul suburb of oakdale 
principal lawrence hartman said he takes a hard line against 
advertisements in schools 
we have categorically rejected it because it always carries 
with it some ad message this is a captive audience here hartman 
said i dont think we can utilize the fact they must be in 
schoolfor profit 
the company says criticisms of the billboards smack of 
hypocrisy many teams have uniforms sponsored by someone in the 
community cheek said 
countered ms anderson band uniforms dont say mampms across 
them 
reproductions of famous paintings or students artwork would be 
more fitting for hallways said ms anderson i dont think these 
posters do anything to boost their selfesteem 
lester knight a university of tennessee elementary education 
professor who is a paid member of the big picture advisory 
board said the educational value of the billboards value overcomes 
any disadvantage of the advertising 
i can understand why some people might say there is a captive 
audience here knight said at the same time the ads are done 
so creatively it seems they could be an impetus for some kids to do 
creative things 
the american association of school administrators has no firm 
guidelines on educational messages with advertising content said 
gary marx the groups associate executive director he said school 
superintendents should weigh the educational value against the 
prominence of the advertising message 
the national association of secondary school principals 
publishes a list of corporate promotions and activities it finds 
acceptable but hasnt addressed the billboard issue

the defense in former gov evan mechams 
criminal trial tried to establish in testimony today that arizonas 
campaign financial reporting procedure can be difficult for 
candidates to understand 
mecham and his brother willard his 1986 campaign treasurer 
face felony charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan on 
financial reports required by the state 
secretary of state jim shumway testified that his office would 
advise a campaign to seek legal help if it asked how to report a 
loan that was backed by promissory notes such as the loan from 
developer barry wolfson 
under questioning by willard mechams lawyer joe keilp shumway 
said his office does not provide instructions on how to fill out 
all of the required reports 
prosecutor michael cudahy objected as keilp asked shumway 
whether his office had been working recently with other state 
officials to revise the law 
cudahy also objected when keilp referred several times to a 
meeting evan mecham sought with shumway in october 1987 after the 
350000 loan was revealed by the news media judge michael ryan of 
maricopa county superior court ruled thursday that testimony on the 
meeting was inadmissible because any advice mecham sought at the 
time was irrelevant to his intent in filing his financial 
statements months earlier 
on thursday former top mecham aide edith richardson testified 
that the loan was well known among his inner circle 
mrs richardson said that she learned probably early in 1987 
that developer barry wolfson had provided mecham with the money 
it was just common knowledge that there was a loan mrs 
richardson former special assistant to mecham told the maricopa 
county superior court jury 
mecham and his brother willard his 1986 campaign treasurer 
face felony charges of concealing the loan on financial statements 
required by the state 
other witnesses in the trial have testified that they may have 
had some general knowledge of a loan but that they did not know 
wolfson was involved 
meanwhile attorneys took a formal deposition thursday from gov 
rose mofford during a closed session at her home but defense 
lawyers later decided it will not be introduced as evidence the 
deposition was to be used in lieu of mrs moffords testimony in 
court because she still has been suffering ill effects from a mild 
concussion she received in a recent fall 
according to a tape recording of the deposition session mrs 
mofford said she knew nothing about the wolfson loan about 
mechams campaign and personal financial disclosure statements or 
about the criminal case 
mecham is on trial on six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faces up to 22 years in 
prison if convicted on all counts his codefendant and brother 
who served as campaign manager is charged with three similar 
counts and faces up to 9 years in prison if convicted 
the defense has contended that the 350000 loan was properly 
reported as part of a 465000 lump sum listed as a contribution 
from mecham the defense also has said the failure to itemize the 
loan was an innocent mistake 
mecham a republican took office in january 1987 he was 
removed from office april 4 when the state senate convicted him of 
two unrelated impeachment counts

a us official on friday discussed 
with east german leaders a plan that for the first time would 
provide payments from this communist nation to jewish victims of 
the nazi holocaust 
us deputy secretary of state john whitehead met with foreign 
minister oskar fischer to discuss details of east german plan made 
public by the official adn news agency on wednesday 
we welcome the announcement whitehead later told the 
associated press 
the adn dispatch said east germany was prepared to lend 
humanitarian aid to jewish survivors of the holocaust living 
outside its borders 
east german officials previously had argued that their nation 
which was formed in 1949 bore no legal or moral responsibility for 
the actions of adolf hitlers third reich 
the news agency did not specify the amount of the payments 
whitehead said friday that the amount is currently being 
discussed 
on monday heinz galanski chairman of the west german jewish 
council said east germany was prepared to pay up to 100 million 
to holocaust victims 
whitehead that he and fischer would meet again to discuss the 
issue within the next few days 
we hope this matter can be resolved in the near future 
whitehead said 
more than 6 million jews were killed under nazi rule 
in 1952 the luxembourg agreement covering reparations was 
signed by the world jewish congress and west germany but not by 
east germany 
since then west germany has paid more than 80 billion marks 
worth 48 billion in todays currency exchange to holocaust 
survivors 
whitehead indicated that there was an urgency in providing the 
additional aid 
it is a tragic situation the plight of holocaust survivors 
because the victims if you think about it are now quite elderly 
there are only a small number of them left whitehead said 
whitehead said talks on the issue also would continue with east 
german officials in washington 
whitehead and fischer are attending a threeday conference on 
eastwest security issues in potsdam

secretary of transportation jim 
burnley today proposed a drug testing program for interstate big 
rig truckers and drivers of passenger buses to make the nations 
highways safer 
when society has a drug problem no segment of our population 
from welfare recipients to wall street brokers is exempt from it 
the trucking industry is clearly vulnerable as well burnley said 
at a news conference at the le mondrian hotel here 
he said although there are no firm statistics to indicate how 
many of the nations truck drivers are drug abusers he cited a 
june 1987 test of 317 tractortrailer drivers in tennessee that 
showed 15 percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana 
cocaine and prescription stimulants 
the proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million drivers of 
commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10000 pounds drivers 
of vehicles that transport 16 or more people or drivers 
transporting hazardous materials school bus drivers and intercity 
bus drivers would not be affected by the proposal he said 
the department of transportation is proposing five types of drug 
testing including preemployment random postaccident as part 
of a physical and for reasonable cause when a trucker is suspected 
of using narcotics

the reagan administration said friday it wants 
to sell up to 40 fa18 warplanes to kuwait which would be the 
first arab state to get americas most sophisticated 
fighterbombers 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater announced the sale plan 
and said the triggering of a 50day process under which congress 
could block the proposed 1 billion sale was imminent 
the sale would be part of an administration policy of arming 
persian gulf nations endangered by attacks spilling over from the 
7yearold iraniraq war gulf states have also benefited from us 
naval cover for tankers plying the oil routes 
congressional opposition to the sale is likely however from 
members who have noted that kuwait like other arab nations is 
technically in a state of war with israel some lawmakers also have 
complained that us arms sales to the region will contribute to an 
alreadydangerous weapons buildup in the gulf without enhancing 
us security 
state department officials met privately with members of the 
senate foreign relations committee on thursday in an effort to 
allay some of those fears 
richard w murphy assistant secretary of state for near east 
affairs said last month that the administration favored the sale 
of advanced aircraft to kuwait but fridays announcement was the 
first ontherecord word that the fa18 produced by mcdonnell 
douglas was chosen over other candidates 
fa18s the newest jets in the us navys carrierbased 
arsenal are twinengine craft with the latest electronic guidance 
systems kuwait chose these planes because they could hit targets 
throughout the gulf and could make a quick transition between 
bombing and interception missions 
pentagon officials said also considered were f16s older planes 
with dual capability but less versatility to change roles quickly 
and the f15 which is a highperformance fighter with limited 
bomber capacity 
only australia canada and spain all formal allies of the 
united states have been permitted to buy fa18s 
if kuwait purchases all 40 planes authorized the contract would 
be worth about 1 billion for mcdonnell douglas which competes 
heavily with the french makers of the mirage 2000 jet 
a state department arms expert said friday that one of the 
arguments the administration could make to congress is that if 
kuwait is denied permission to buy fa18s it will turn to 
mirages giving the french manufacturer the profit 
unlike israel and egypt who purchase billions of dollars of 
us weapons with funds from the us foreign aid budget kuwait 
would buy the fa18s with its own money 
the kuwaitis also are reported to be ready to buy armaments that 
can be carried by fa18s and other us planes maverick 
airtoground missiles airtoair sidewinder missiles and harpoon 
antiship missiles 
under us arms sale law the administration sends an 
informal notice to capitol hill of its intention to sell 
weapons to a particular country then 20 days later formal notice 
is given and congress has 30 days to block the transfer if both 
houses concur

tens of thousands of armenians have shut down 
several southern cities with daily strikes and marches to demand 
that the region in which they live be joined with the armenian 
republic pravda reported friday 
the communist party newspaper said the strikes began may 23 and 
shut down most industries and mass transit in stepanakert the main 
city of nagornokarabakh 
also affected were three regional centers within 
nagornokarabakh martunin mardakert and askeran nearly all 
cafeterias and stores were closed but farms continue to operate 
according to pravda 
nagornokarabakh is an autonomous region of the soviet republic 
of azerbaijan in the caucasus mountains its 160000 people are 
mostly armenian 
since february armenians in nagornokarabakh have demanded the 
region be taken from azerbaijan and made part of armenia 
every morning tens of thousands of people move sidebyside 
in columns along streets toward the center of the city of 
stepanakert with banners and signs conducting demonstrations 
the newspaper reported 
armenians have set up selfdefense posts around the clock to 
prevent attacks by azeris pravda said but it said such measures 
are unnecessary because there havent been any attacks 
tensions are so high that some armenians in nagornokarabakh 
have set up a system of 24hour guards to prevent attacks by 
azeris pravda said 
residents of the area and moscowbased dissidents have been 
reporting the latest wave of unrest to western journalists but the 
soviet press carried nothing on the situation until friday 
phone calls to the region on friday did not go through 
armenian residents of nagornokarabakh complain of poor cultural 
and social services and discrimination by azeris the main ethnic 
group in azerbaijan armenians are predominantly christian while 
most azeris are moslem 
the newspaper said unrest in the region has cost the government 
41 million 
the nagornokarabakh dispute has become the most severe issue 
involving some of the countrys more than 100 nationalities taking 
advantage of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness on some issues armenians have been 
staging street rallies marches and strikes 
the government has refused to give nagornokarabakh to armenia 
and ordered improvements in living conditions for the regions 
people 
one azerbaijani official said the issue would never have been so 
openly aired before gorbachev took power in 1985 
there was national selfawareness before april 1985 shakyul 
aleskerov the party chief of the ordubadsky region of azerbaijan 
told the newspaper syelskaya zhizn they simply didnt talk about 
it so openly and concretely in an interview published friday he 
said that behind the beautiful slogans of equality and 
brotherhood accumulated unsolved problems 
gorbachev has said nationalities problems are among the most 
acute facing the country and that a meeting of the policymaking 
communist party central committee should be devoted to them 
such an unusual and unexpected word for us pravda said 
referring to the strike that has affected nagornokarabakh 
soviet officials used to describe strikes as a western 
phenomenon that was anathema to their socialist system of rule by 
the working class 
but strikes have become a frequent way for armenians to press 
their demand 
pravda acknowledged that the central soviet press had been 
ignoring the nagornokarabakh story since february when the unrest 
began but that in the meantime tension in the region did not 
subside 
it said it was providing an update now because readers had 
written letters asking if the situation had improved 
pravda said armenians have been mixing rumors and facts about 
what happened in the azerbaijani city of sumgait and that this has 
led to unwarranted fear azeris went on a rampage at the end of 
february in sumgait and 32 people were killed most of them 
armenians 
pravda disclosed that azeris staged their own demonstrations may 
1415 in their capital of baku and other azerbaijani cities the 
newspaper blamed nagornokarabakhs party officials for not ending 
the strike 
the regions top party official boris kevorkov was fired feb 
24 and kicked out of the party in late may for negligence that 
soviet media said exacerbated the ethnic conflict 
demonstrations also have been taking place in yerevan the 
capital of armenia a group of armenians began a sitin outside the 
citys opera theater on may 25 they want the parliament of 
armenia the supreme soviet to consider their demands to annex 
nagornokarabakh at a meeting on wednesday

they differ on why but friends and foes of florida 
sen bob graham agree on one thing hes a political winner 
grahams a phenomenon said charles black a republican 
consultant who helped run thensen paula hawkins unsuccessful 
1986 reelection bid against graham he is not what you call a 
charismatic personality but hes a public relations genius 
bob graham has managed to survive in florida because he has 
some of the attributes the personal skills of ronald reagan 
added jm mac stipanovich chief adviser to republican gov 
bob martinez he is able to communicate very well with the mass 
public symbolically and physically he is very skilled at 
convincing everybody hes on their side 
the firstterm senator is on most lists of potential democratic 
running mates for massachusetts gov michael dukakis although 
grahams brief washington tenure could work against him 
conventional wisdom would point the governor in the direction of 
someone with long experience in the nations capital 
graham also has some serious policy disagreements with dukakis 
for example he is known for vigorous enforcement of the death 
penalty signing more than 150 death warrants while 16 executions 
were carried out and for support of military aid to the nicaraguan 
contras dukakis opposes both 
among his advantages graham would give dukakis a strong 
opportunity to carry electoral giant florida which graham governed 
for eight years 
graham has solid new south progressive credentials and his 
years as governor saw major education and environmental programs 
while graham isnt an exciting speaker hes proven to be a 
tireless enthusiastic campaigner given to singing and poking fun 
at himself he was a star attraction at annual florida press corps 
skits in which graham did takeoffs on rock music stars and latin 
dictators 
he built his uphill gubernatorial campaign in 1978 around 100 
workdays spending a day each at 100 jobs including hialeah 
stable boy tomato picker garbage man bellboy and chicken parts 
processor the workdays have continued monthly 
hell go on stage in boxer shorts or paint his face and put on 
a headdress stipanovich recalled in that way he would be a 
good counterweight to dukakis 
on the campaign trail its often easy to forget that graham is 
a harvardeducated lawyer and multimillionaire whose family made a 
fortune in land development and dairy cattle his late father 
ernest ran successfully for state senator in 1936 the year graham 
was born and his halfbrother philip graham ran the washington 
post and was a major democratic power broker until his suicide in 
1963 
graham has been a lowkey senator quietly he has been active 
in latin american policy and often meets with reagan administration 
officials and leading democratic colleagues on those issues he 
recently completed a threenation tour of south america and 
returned with detailed knowledge of the complex latin debt problem 
displayed at a washington news conference that some reporters 
admitted went over their heads 
graham suggested that florida which dukakis called a 
bellwether state before winning its march 8 primary is a key 
state for democrats who have seen only lyndon johnson and jimmy 
carter carry it in the last four decades 
democrats still hold a 32 lead in registered voters but the 
state has been a challenge to campaign strategists because of its 
mix of traditional southern democratic conservatives in the north 
reaganites along its gulf coast northeastern liberals along 
southeastern florida and large blocs of hispanics and senior 
citizens 
if a campaign can be constructed that will carry florida that 
almost assures that dukakis will carry the country graham said 
if you carry florida that means that a democrat has broad enough 
appeal to win anywhere 
although he has indicated he would be interested in 
consideration by dukakis graham plays down the possibility 
its very flattering to be included on a list of some people i 
admire sam nunn john glenn lloyd bentsen and the others but 
im not going to be affected by that graham said im looking 
forward to the challenges of the senate thats where i anticipate 
that i will be the next several years

as fun as peewee is its not as fun as just painting a 
picture panter said in an interview with the pensacola news 
journal published friday 
everything kind of comes out of painting for me but modern 
art painting theory is so broad you can do anything and call it 
painting said panter who also has designed album covers for 
frank zappa and others 
the show exhibits 22 pieces diverse both in subject and style 
cartoon animals primitive buffaloes dinosaur sculptures 
psychedelic murals and simple line pieces 
they range in size from cookie company a mural occupying an 
entire wall to dinosaur a 15inch tall sculpture that would 
fit in peewees toy box 
director mary takach said the museum occasionally likes to show 
works by upandcoming contemporary artists and chose panter partly 
because of his association with reubens 
panter says he has been inspired by a range of sources including 
picasso andy warhol and walt disney his goal he said is to 
bring art to where it doesnt belong trying to bridge the gap 
between fine art and commercial art 
its like when youre driving out in the jungle or somewhere 
and you come across a big smurf sign he said its really 
neat

a judge heard final arguments friday on 
whether marijuana has a medical use with proponents contending 
that the drug can help people suffering from a variety of diseases 
and the government maintaining that the drugs safety has not been 
proven 
administrative law judge francis l young did not specify when 
he would make his recommendations on the issue to the head of the 
drug enforcement administration but lawyers for both sides said 
they expected youngs ruling by late summer or early fall 
at issue in the 16yearold case is whether marijuana should be 
reclassified from a schedule i drug where it like heroin and 
lsd cannot be produced by pharmaceutical companies and has no 
accepted medical use to a schedule ii drug that can be marketed 
for medical uses 
the hearings before young began last november in new orleans 
continued in san francisco in december and moved to washington in 
january in that time legalization advocates among them the 
national organization for the reform of marijuana laws and the 
alliance for cannabis therapeutics presented dozens of witnesses 
who said marijuana could help cancer patients suffering from nausea 
from chemotherapy treatments glaucoma sufferers and people with 
multiple sclerosis and a host of other neurological diseases 
attorney kevin zeese representing norml told the judge that 
thousands of people were tested after using marijuana for medical 
reasons in federally approved state experiments and the lack of 
side effects was astounding the most common side effect was 
fatigue and dry mouth which are not significant compared to the 
side effects of other drugs commonly prescribed to these people 
attorney frank b stilwell iii representing the alliance for 
cannabis therapeutics argued that society at large accepts 
marijuana as a medicine and said the dea is so caught up in the 
drug war it is afraid to say that marijuana has medical uses 
charlotte mapes representing the dea countered that marijuana 
is a complex drug whose effects are not known completely and that 
further testing is needed she also said that groups like the 
american medical association had not endorsed the use of marijuana 
for medical purposes 
arent there politics involved in the amas position the 
judge asked ms mapes she said there were 
the judge at another point asked ms mapes whether she agreed 
with arguments by the legalization advocates that the federal 
governments standards on drug legalization were slanted toward 
synthetically produced drugs 
they argue that we have a situation where monied 
pharmaceutical companies are willing and able to send great sums of 
money to win approval for drugs young said the petitioners 
argue that the federal standards are not slanted toward natural 
drugs 
ms mapes responded that the food and drug administration is 
constructed toward the needs of pharmaceutical companies adding 
though that the federal standards for drug approval are also 
accepted by the medical community 
the case dates back to 1972 when norml petitioned the dea to 
remove marijuana from its drug schedules in effect to 
decriminalize possession of the drug 
the dea took no action in the case until 1979 when it announced 
that it would continue to classify marijuana as unfit for medical 
use norml by that time joined by the alliance for cannabis 
therapeutics appealed to the us court of appeals in washington 
and the court ordered the dea to reconsider its action and to 
conduct hearings on the issue 
also arguing against legalizing marijuana for medical use at 
fridays hearing was karl burnstein president of the national 
federation of parents for drugfree youth based in silver spring 
md 
burnstein said his group was concerned that if marijuana would 
be rescheduled what kind of message would that be sending to this 
nation our citizens are not familiar with the details of federal 
laws he said adding that he feared the nations youth would say 
that if marijuana is good for all these medical things why 
isnt it good for me

iraqi warplanes raided a tanker off iran 
at dawn friday one day after ending a twoweek lull in the persian 
gulf sea war with an attack on a salvage tug that served iranian 
vessels 
the raids coincided with a declaration of support from an arab 
summit for iraqs efforts to force iran to accept a ceasefire 
resolution the un security council passed unanimously last july 
a final communique issued thursday by the arab league summit in 
algiers criticized iranian intransigence in refusing to settle 
its war with iraq which began in september 1980 it praised iraqs 
willingness to talk peace and its military achievements in the war 
iraq has attacked iranian oil facilities and tankers iran owns 
and charters since 1983 in an attempt to dry up the petroleum 
exports with which the iranians finance the war the iraqis also 
pay for the war with oil but most of their exports go overland by 
pipeline 
iran attacks neutral commercial shipping in response most often 
in the southern gulf in or near the narrow strait of hormuz that 
provides the only sea access to the waterway 
more than 500 ships have been attacked and more than 300 seamen 
killed 
a military spokesman in baghdad said jets patrolling over 
iranian waters spotted and attacked a large maritime target 
the standard term for a tanker scoring an accurate and effective 
hit 
gulf shipping executives had no immediate confirmation they 
said an attack reported thursday referred to the salvage tugboat 
salverve which flies the singapore flag and serves iranian 
shipping in the northern gulf 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit of london said two seamen on 
the 742ton salverve were killed salvage executives said they 
probably were filipinos 
iraqi planes have hit the salverve twice before in july 1987 
and last january while it was towing an iranian tanker crippled in 
a previous raid the british captain and two filipino seamen were 
killed in the january attack 
many of the ships iran attacks belong to or trade with kuwait 
and saudi arabia which iran accuses of aiding iraq in the war 
eleven kuwaiti tankers half the sheikdoms fleet were given 
american flags and registration last july so us warships could 
protect them 
saudi arabia broke relations with iran on april 26 citing 
attacks on shipping and riots by iranians during the annual islamic 
pilgrimage to mecca last summer in which more than 400 people were 
killed

despite the biggest increase in food costs 
since january wholesale prices rose a moderate 05 percent in may 
the government said friday supporting beliefs that inflation is 
accelerating but not dangerously 
the rise in the labor departments producer price index for 
finished goods in may was halfway between a 04 percent increase in 
april and a 06 percent jump in march 
but if it continued for 12 months the annual rate of inflation 
would amount to 58 percent nearly triple the 2 percentage points 
it has risen in the past year 
there clearly is some inflation in the system but the fears 
of an inflationary boom are overblown said larry chimerine 
president of the wefa group formerly wharton econometrics an 
economic forecasting consultant in bala cynwyd pa 
also taking comfort in the may numbers were officials at the 
white house where spokesman marlin fitzwater said inflation 
remains low and under control 
food replaced energy as the primary impetus behind higher 
wholesale prices last month at the prices paid by grocery stores 
food rose 09 percent in may the biggest increase since a 17 
percent jump in january 
egg prices jumped 125 percent mostly offsetting a 16 percent 
decline in april poultry prices were up 82 percent pork was up 
55 percent and vegetable prices rose 33 percent however 
wholesale prices for fruit declined 09 percent and rice was down 
32 percent 
wholesale food prices at the grocery store level are still only 
06 per cent higher than they were a year ago that trend is not 
expected to continue particularly with nearrecord dry weather in 
the farm belt pushing raw commodity prices for food upward 24 
percent in may 
weve got a couple more months of bad food prices coming 
everybody knows that and then everything will calm down said 
michael evans who runs a forecasting firm in washington 
donald ratajczak an economist at georgia state university who 
runs his own wholesale price survey said the danger of higher food 
prices setting off an inflationary spiral is much less than the 
fear that they will 
unfortunately he said inflationary perceptions are being 
formed from the performance of a commodity index the commodity 
research bureau index that depends heavily on grain prices 
dry weather has increased fears that crop yields may be 
harmed ratajczak said but sufficient surpluses of all 
products except soybeans should reduce the significance on prices 
energy prices which had surged 31 percent in april rose only 
02 percent in may largely because of a 38 percent drop in 
natural gas prices 
home heating oil rose a modest 07 percent compared with hikes 
of 52 percent in april and 26 percent in march gasoline prices 
jumped 38 percent last month but were still only 15 percent 
higher than a year ago 
the governments index for wholesale prices at the finished 
goods level minus energy and food was up 03 percent analysts 
consider this a more reliable indicator of underlying inflation 
because of the monthtomonth volatility of food and energy costs 
over the past year wholesale prices excluding food and energy 
have risen 28 percent 
leading the may increase in those nonfood nonenergy items 
were soaps and detergents up 13 percent womens clothing up 08 
percent tires up 3 percent and prescription drugs up 07 
percent 
car prices rose a modest 02 percent in may after declining 1 
percent in april on manufacturers rebates to dealers higher 
prices also were recorded for cosmetics household flatware and 
home electronic equipment all of which had declined in april 
childrens clothing prices dropped 13 percent after rising 
slightly more than half a percent in april the only other product 
which had a price drop was alcoholic beverages down 04 percent 
the may increase brought the overall wholesale price index for 
finished goods to 1075 meaning that a basket of products costing 
100 in 1982 would cost 10750 last month up 60 cents from april 
at the intermediate goods level items such as flour fabrics 
steel mill products lumber and fertilizers prices in may rose 
06 percent compared with a 08 percent rise in april 
excluding food prices for raw commodities such as tobacco leaf 
cattle hides coal and scrap metals rose just 03 percent in may 
compared with a 17 percent jump the previous month 
so far this year wholesale prices are rising slower than 
consumer prices for the first five months of 1988 wholesale costs 
at the most widely cited finished goods level are up 34 percent 
consumer prices through april are up 45 percent may figures on 
consumer prices are due out june 21

the military services easily met or exceeded 
their recruiting goals during the first half of the fiscal year 
thanks in part to budget cuts that lowered their manpower goals 
the pentagon said friday 
the army navy air force and marine corps also reported 
excellent recruit quality with the percentage of recruits 
possessing a high school diploma increasing to 92 percent from 91 
percent a year earlier the pentagon said 
nonetheless concern remains for future recruiting 
prospects said grant s green jr the assistant defense 
secretary for personnel 
this years recruiting objectives are significantly below 
those of last year had the services been recruiting to last years 
levels this quality might not have been achieved 
releasing its latest quarterly report the defense department 
said the four services signed up a combined 133000 recruits during 
the first six months of fiscal 1988 a period that ended march 31 
that compares with a combined goal of 131100 and all four 
services met or exceeded their individual objectives 
by comparison during the same period in fiscal 1987 the 
services had to sign up 150900 recruits the recruiting objectives 
have been falling because the pentagon plans to cut activeduty 
strength by almost 36000 this year to cope with budget cuts 
on the reenlistment side several key statistics trailed 
those achieved during the comparable period fiscal 1987 green 
said 
the navy marine corps and air force reported firstterm 
reenlistment rates several percentage points below last years 
secondquarter numbers the department will continue monitoring 
retention trends closely 
the pentagon pays particular attention to the percentage of men 
and women willing to reenlist after completing their initial 
obligation viewing it as a measure not only of military readiness 
and experience in the force but also job satisfaction 
during the first half of fiscal 1988 54 percent of navy 
personnel eligible to reenlist for the first time did so down 
from 58 percent during the same period a year ago 
similarly the first term reenlistment numbers dropped for the 
marine corps from 35 percent to 32 percent and for the air force 
from 67 percent to 56 percent 
the army managed to buck that trend reporting that firstterm 
reenlistments rose from 40 percent to 46 percent

rival palestinian guerrilla factions 
battled with mortars and machine guns in beiruts two refugee camps 
for a third day friday police said eight people were killed and 50 
wounded 
one stray shell slammed into a crowded vegetable market near the 
chatilla camp at midafternoon killing two people and wounding 31 
the rest of the casualties occurred in overnight clashes between 
plo chairman yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction and the 
dissident fatahuprising group in chatilla and the bourj 
elbarajneh camp police said 
the syrianbacked dissidents are led by col saeed mousa 
codenamed abu mousa who broke away from fatah in 1983 and set up 
headquarters in damascus syria 
fridays casualties increased the known casualties to 10 killed 
and 60 wounded since the latest round of fighting between the 
feuding wings erupted wednesday 
also friday israelibacked militiamen opened fire on un 
peacekeepers in southern lebanon and slightly wounded a norwegian 
soldier a spokesman for the peacekeeping force said in jerusalem 
members of the south lebanon army militia also held un troops 
at gunpoint for nearly an hour and prevented them from 
administering first aid to the wounded man said timor goksel 
spokesman for the united nations interim force in lebanon or 
unifil 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across beirut as a third 
ceasefire mediated by a security committee made up of 
representatives of neutral guerrilla factions collapsed after a 
brief midmorning lull 
arafats loyalists had flushed out abu mousas guerrillas from 
both embattled shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting in the 
last two months despite a reconciliation between arafat and syrian 
president hafez assad 
but the dissidents regrouped at the syriancontrolled edges of 
the two camps in recent days trying to counterattack police 
reported 
israeli army officials refused comment on the reported incident 
involving proisraeli militiamen in south lebanon 
goksel said the militiamen withdrew when an israeli officer 
arrived at the scene and ordered them to release the un troops 
we filed a complaint with the israeli army goksel said we 
told them to get a rein on these people 
the south lebanon army a force of mainly christian lebanese 
militiamen helps israel patrol its selfdeclared security zone 
in southern lebanon israel set up the zone a 6to10mile wide 
strip of land north of the israelilebanese border when it 
withdrew the bulk of its troops from lebanon in june 1985 ending a 
threeyear occupation 
goksel said fridays incident began when nine militiamen and 
four members of the militias security service broke through a un 
checkpoint near the village of kaoukaba about 10 miles north of 
the israelilebanese border 
in response peacekeepers closed off the next unifil checkpoint 
guarded by six norwegian soldiers 
when the sla people arrived at that checkpoint they jumped 
out aimed their guns at the heads of the norwegian soldiers took 
their weapons and forced them to lie on the ground goksel said 
when a norwegian officer 2nd lt rune gleditch arrived at the 
scene and tried to defuse the situation militiamen opened fire on 
him wounding him in the right knee goksel said 
gleditch was finally evacuated by helicopter and taken to a 
hospital in southern lebanon where he was reported in satisfactory 
condition goksel said he did not know gleditchs age or hometown 
since the 5800strong unifil force was deployed in lebanon in 
1978 about 250 un peacekeepers have been wounded goksel said

restaurant row a theater district block with 
more than a score of finetomiddling eating establishments has 
called in a volunteer anticrime patrol to turn a tide of human 
riffraff that has driven diners away 
a team of 30 guardian angels young men and women in red berets 
began patrolling the block this week and there was marked 
improvement after two days joe allen owner of a restaurant of 
the same name said friday 
ive had people calling up for reservations telling me how 
glad they were that we are doing this and how much better it makes 
them feel about coming here he said 
the patrollers on west 46th street have fingered drug dealers 
for police arrests and kept crackusers loiterers and prostitutes 
on the move allen added 
when an explosion of crack cocaine trafficking and loitering 
reduced business by as much as 20 percent allen and 14 other 
restaurant owners asked the angels for help 
the restaurateurs gave 300 each to finance the effort the 
angels receive nothing personally the restaurateurs supplied the 
patrollers with walkietalkies and allowed them to use a french 
restaurant closed because of a slump in patronage as a headquarters 
and barracks 
the patrollers also are being fed in rotation by the 
restaurants they are protecting the first week the food has been 
coming from audrone whose frenchcontinental fare is rated very 
good to excellent in a popular restaurant guide 
restaurant row has for years enjoyed a thriving businesslunch 
trade and solid evening patronage from tourists and theatergoers 
broadways playhouses are a short walk away 
my guys have gone from fastfood chicken to dishes they cant 
pronounce itll be a while before they get a gourmet palate 
said curtis sliwa who founded the angels in 1979 and now claims 
about 5000 members nationwide 
the angels were organized as an unarmed youth patrol to deter 
subway crime though frowned on as unqualified vigilantes by 
police their presence reassured subway riders and they branched 
out to escorting the elderly 
although police made 600 arrests last year in restaurant rows 
immediate neighborhood and an additional 650 through may of this 
year the problems havent gone away said deputy inspector edward 
fitzgerald commander of the local police precinct

friday he met with us officials and lawmakers to seek their 
support for preventing a massacre of his people by iraqi president 
saddam hussein

organizations in the northern autonomous region of kurdistan said 
that over the past three years husseins government had destroyed 
some 1300 kurdish towns and villages poisoned water sources and 
deported some 15 million inhabitants to remote desert areas

mustard gas last march on the town of halabja killing some 5000 
people he said the united states has condemned the iraqi attack 
talabani said state department officials have promised to press

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on friday accused pakistan of violating the accord on 
the afghan war by continuing to give arms to the rebels and he 
said the united states is partly to blame 
at a news conference he repeated a soviet foreign ministry 
statement that if violations continue the soviet union may be 
obliged to review the ninemonth schedule for troop withdrawal 
stipulated in the accord 
the united states and soviet union are guarantors of the 
afghanistan agreement signed by afghanistan and pakistan on april 
14 in geneva 
in another development the united nations on friday called on 
the world community to donate more than 1 billion over 18 months 
to help the people of afghanistan resettle their warshattered 
nation 
pakistan and afghanistan agreed not to interfere in each others 
internal affairs under terms of the geneva accord and many 
observers say pakistans training and arming of afghan guerrillas 
is a clear violation the united states also supports and has 
supplied arms to the rebels and is pakistans major arms supplier 
in his statement at the soviet mission on friday shevardnadze 
said in answer to a question when we criticize pakistan for 
noncompliance for nonobservance of its obligations under the 
geneva agreement we also of course have in mind the united 
states 
if pakistan is violating the geneva accords of course the 
united states too bears a portion of the responsibility he 
said 
he said that if violations by pakistan continue then we may 
have to review the schedule of withdrawal of soviet troops and we 
believe this would be quite legal the minister added but that 
would be an extreme measure and not something we would want to do 
diplomats said that shevardnadzes statement was his first 
criticism of the united states by name for aiding afghan rebels 
in a speech to the general assembly on disarmament wednesday 
shevardnadze also indirectly criticized the united states on the 
afghanistan issue and said us actions could harm the possible 
settlement of other regional issues 
under the afghan accord the soviet union agreed to withdraw 
more than 110000 troops over nine months beginning may 15 about 
a third are to be withdrawn in the first three months 
afghan leader najib said this week that 34000 soviet troops 
have left while soviet officials said 15000 had been withdrawn 
prince sadruddin aga khan the coordinator of the united 
nations humanitarian and economic assistance program for 
afghanistan said a 12 billion relief program is needed to see 
the afghan people through two crop cycles 
the nearly decadelong war between the communist government in 
kabul and the moslem rebels has crippled agricultural production in 
afghanistan 
now the united nations must drive a wedge which can shore up 
stability and trigger a return to normalcy in the country said 
sadruddin 
the 12 billion amount is not the total needs of afghanistan 
but what we after a very careful estimate what we feel can be 
absorbed he said 
sadruddin later explained that by absorption he meant that 
warfare in some areas might hinder distribution that the primitive 
road network in the mountainous nation slows delivery of supplies 
and that he did not want grain supplies to rot in stockpiles 
no specific pledges were announced friday sadruddin said there 
would be a donor coordinating meeting tuesday at the united 
nations at which he hoped that some initial pledges could be 
announced

president corazon aquino signed a 
land reform bill into law friday and said she hoped the measure 
will enable the country to feed itself and lift filipino peasants 
from poverty 
mrs aquino in a nationally televised speech congratulated 
congress for passing the bill after nearly a year of debate the 
bill approved wednesday is considered essential in defeating the 
19year communist insurgency 
the military announced the arrests of a west german a swede and 
a filipino of german descent accused of helping communist rebels 
seven soldiers and 10 insurgents were reported killed in 
fighting west of the capital 
also on friday workers exhumed 12 bodies from a mass grave at a 
suburban cemetery human rights organizations said the grave may 
contain victims of rightwing death squads 
the land reform act which officials say will benefit 3 million 
landless farmers gives landowners the choice of dividing their 
property among tenants or sharing profits with them 
mrs aquino said she hoped the 10year program will increase 
agricultural production and lead to the upliftment of the 
filipino masses from their ancient poverty 
she said she expects all cabinet members to support land reform 
and threatened to fire officials who impede its implementation 
under the plan each landowner may retain 12 acres and an 
additional seven acres for each direct heir over the age 15 who 
will till the land a landowner has the option of sharing profits 
or giving workers shares of stock instead of physically dividing 
the property 
leftist farm groups have branded the plan a grand deception 
because they claim it does not go far enough in breaking up huge 
estates and redistributing property to the landless 
mrs aquino had been criticized for the pace of land reform the 
philippines attempted about a dozen land reform programs in the 
past but they failed for lack of funds or resistance from 
landowners 
land reform was among the demands of prosoviet rebels in the 
1950s and early 1960s and is a major demand of communist rebels in 
the insurgency that began in 1968 
officials say the program estimated to cost 70 billion will 
be financed by foreign aid and assets of former president ferdinand 
marcos and his associates those assets were seized on grounds they 
were acquired illegally 
the military announced that troops arrested the rev klaus 
schmidt 52 a west german protestant minister stellan hermansson 
30 a swede and antonio bosch 46 a filipino of german descent 
for possible links with communist rebels 
the west german and swedish embassies said they were unaware of 
the reports 
in stockholm officials of the young communist league said 
hermansson was the organizations president spokesman erik 
cardfelt said hermansson was a freeland journalist and arrived may 
18 to gather information for lectures 
col hernani figueroa spokesman of the militarys southern 
luzon command said the three were arrested wednesday in quezon 
province he said they had been reported training rebels 
figueroa said soldiers identified the three as among guerrillas 
who raided the town of san francisco in february 
figueroa said they were being held in lucena city 60 miles 
southeast of manila 
in suburban makati workers exhumed 12 bodies from a mass grave 
the churchbacked ecumenical movement for justice and peace said 
the grave contained at least 22 bodies buried in april at the south 
cemetery 
movement officials obtained a court order authorizing the 
exhumation to determine if some of those buried were missing 
members of the leftwing youth for democracy and nationalism 
in bataan province communist rebels stormed an army post 
wednesday killing seven troops and wounding two others military 
officials said they said two rebels were killed 
the governments news agency said friday that eight more rebels 
were killed in orani town in the bataan peninsula 30 miles west of 
the capital

us transportation secretary jim 
burnley called friday for drug tests for up to 5 million drivers of 
interstate trucks passenger buses and vehicles carrying hazardous 
materials 
we must act to identify those commercial drivers who abuse 
drugs and get them off the roads when one drugged truck or bus 
driver goes out on the road he not only puts the lives of many 
people in danger he gives the entire work force a bad 
reputation burnley said 
his announcement at a news conference here follows similar 
proposals unveiled in march for the aviation industry and in may 
for railroads 
there are no firm statistics to indicate how many truck drivers 
are drug abusers burnley said but he cited a june 1987 test of 
317 tractortrailer drivers in tennessee that showed 15 percent of 
the drivers tested positive for marijuana cocaine or prescription 
stimulants 
he also noted a survey of 1300 truck drivers in florida in 
which 36 percent said they sometimes drove under the influence of 
drugs 
when society has a drug problem no segment of our population 
from welfare recipients to wall street brokers is exempt from it 
the trucking industry is clearly vulnerable as well burnley said 
operating these large heavy vehicles requires that a driver 
be fully alert and in complete control of his mental faculties 
he added 
the proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million people who 
drive commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10000 pounds 
vehicles that transport 16 or more people or vehicles that 
transport hazardous materials school bus drivers and city bus 
drivers would not be affected by the proposal he said 
the department of transportation is proposing five types of drug 
testing preemployment random postaccident as part of a 
physical and for reasonable cause when a trucker is suspected of 
using narcotics 
burnley did not suggest a budget or method of payment for the 
drug testing plan 
in washington the american trucking associations endorsed the 
effort but expressed concerns about how the tests would be 
implemented 
lana batts a legislative specialist at the trade organization 
said there is concern the tests would focus on drivers for large 
companies and not reach many of the estimated 400000 
owneroperator drivers and those driving for small companies 
the transportation department has suggested small companies or 
independent operators might join together to develop a testing 
program 
batts said the trucking companies favor legislation calling for 
roadside drug tests for truckers to be established as a pilot 
program in four states that legislation has passed the senate but 
has yet to be considered in the house 
burnley said he would ask for help from the industry and the 
public in seeking effective ways to reach independent truckers 
the program calls for those whose positive drug tests are 
confirmed in followups to be barred from driving in interstate 
commerce depending on circumstances the employee could be 
reinstated upon successful completion of a rehabilitation program 
the program does not cover alcohol abuse because states already 
have strict laws governing drunken drivers he said burnley added 
that studies have shown truck drivers use less alcohol but more 
stimulants than the public

a new state law banning obscene materials 
and performances in wisconsin should withstand expected legal 
challenges state officials say 
gov tommy g thompson signed the bill thursday as about 100 
people applauded 
this isnt the end of our fight against pornography this 
is only the beginning of our battle marlene mcmullin of omro 
said 
this bill is good public policy thompson said i want 
to publicly thank all of those who made this possible this day has 
been a long time coming 
the measure bans materials and performances fitting a threepart 
definition of obscenity it takes effect the day after it is 
published probably next week officials said 
court challenges are expected said rep robert welch a 
proponent 
we are comfortable with the law we think its constitutional 
we think it will pass a court test said deputy attorney general 
mark musolf 
in 1980 the supreme court ruled a previous law unconstitutional 
on grounds it was vague and too broad the new law adopts a 
threepart obscenity test put forth by the us supreme court in a 
california case it also exempts libraries and contract printers 
critics of the bill including the wisconsin chapter of the 
american civil liberties union fought its enactment contending it 
could lead to censorship 
were not going after playboy magazine or mark twain 
welch said were only going after hardcore smut 
he said the bills target will be publications films or 
performances which offer blatant depictions of sexual acts 
under the law a performance or work would be considered obscene 
if the average person applying contemporary community standards 
would find it appeals to the prurient interest if taken as a whole 
under contemporary community standards it describes or shows 
sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and tt lacks serious 
literary artistic political educational or scientific value if 
taken as a whole 
first and second offenses would be civil matters a third 
offense could be punished by a 10000 fine and imprisonment up to 
five years

several congressmen on friday defended 2000 
payments they received for attending a breakfast briefing just 
before voting to extend a huge contract for the truck manufacturer 
that fed and paid them 
rep marvin leath dtexas said the payments by oshkosh truck 
co of oshkosh wis were proper and not meant to influence the 
vote although he said he would not mind if the congressional 
honorarium system were abandoned 
leath and aides to other members of the house armed services 
procurement subcommittee who attended the april 1 1987 breakfast 
meeting said the timing of the meeting and the vote was 
coincidental 
the voice vote extending the governments currently 239 million 
annual contract with oshkosh for five years was nearly unanimous 
leath said the contract calls for multimilliondollar penalties to 
be paid to the company if the government terminates the contract 
congress later approved the subcommittee action despite army 
proposals to stop buying the 130000 oshkosh trucks in favor of 
developing a sophisticated new model 
leath said he resented what he called inferences of impropriety 
in a dallas morning news article that reported on the honoraria 
friday 
the fact is the house rules permit honorariums they are 
legal to intimate that they are illegal or immoral and are given 
to buy support is neither factual nor accurate said leath 
the payments were acknowledged by the company and detailed in 
required financial disclosure forms filed last month by leath and 
reps larry hopkins rky roy dyson dmd norman sisisky 
dva robert bedham dcalif and bill dickinson rala 
rep ike skelton dmo who was listed by the dallas newspaper 
as also attending the meeting said he was holding a prayer 
breakfast at the time but he reported a 2000 honorarium from 
oshkosh for participating in a luncheon meeting on april 28 1987 
long after any decisions were made on buying the companys 
trucks he said 
skelton said he saw nothing improper in accepting the money for 
attending the later luncheon he did not recall details of the 
meeting but said it was likely that the companys truck sales were 
discussed 
all the congressmen who accepted the payments except dickinson 
the ranking republican on the armed services committee are 
members of the 19member procurement subcommittee that hours after 
the breakfast approved extension of contracts to buy thousands of 
oshkosh trucks over five years 
it looks kind of funny doesnt it said oshkosh vice 
president vp pres grove quoted in the morning news 
grove said the honoraria were not designed to preserve oshkoshs 
10ton truck program and are just sort of the way business is 
done in washington 
leath said he saw nothing wrong with taking honoraria and 
confirmed a quote attributed to him by the morning news 
i guarantee you if they call me again and say would you 
like to come up here and get an honorarium ill do it you can 
take that to the bank 
he said he would not object if the honorarium system were 
discontinued but said he does not think it is abused 
hopkins said he was not compromised by the honorarium 
any implication of that is an insult to me personally and to 
my integrity he said 
hopkins said the issue was whether to scrap a workable program 
or to let the pentagon march off in search of a whole new family 
of expensive trucks 
sisiskys press secretary evelyn frazier said the virginia 
lawmaker voted against the procurement she said he was not fully 
aware of the honorarium when he accepted the invitation to 
attend but he regularly donates his entire congressional salary 
and honoraria to charity 
dysons press aide katie tucker said he did attend the 
breakfast but does not recall the vote she said dyson has a policy 
of not accepting honoraria from companies unless he is on record 
supporting their position she said he accepted the oshkosh payment 
and has supported contracts for the company since 1981 
bedham confirmed through an aide that he voted for the measure 
dickinson aide mike lewis said the congressman attended the 
breakfast and received the 2000 but he denied a morning news 
report that dickinson played a key role later in negotiating a 
compromise with the senate that required the army to buy even more 
oshkosh trucks 
in fact he still doesnt understand why we have to buy more 
trucks than the army asked for lewis said

the reagan administration asked congress on 
friday to get tough on coal wildcatters by making it a felony to 
strip mine coal without a permit 
legislation sent to capitol hill by the office of surface mining 
reclamation and enforcement calls for a maximum prison term of five 
years for people convicted of mining without a permit 
the proposal also would allow a judge to impose a fine of up to 
250000 against a convicted individual and a fine of up to 
500000 against a convicted organization 
strip mining without a permit is now a civil offense with a top 
penalty of 22500 but office spokesman alan cole said that the 
civil procedures are so ponderous its difficult to keep up with 
the wildcatters 
in a prepared statement robert gentile acting director of the 
office said that what the wildcatters are doing is not only 
illegal it is an insult to lawabiding citizens and the legitimate 
coal industry 
the wildcatters blatant disregard for our system means the 
time has come to go after them with a vengeance he said

president reagan will veto plans to overhaul 
the nations welfare system now working their way through congress 
white house aides said friday 
the aides said reagan atfer meeting with a group of welfare 
leaders declared his intention to veto both a bill passed by the 
house and another set for debate in the senate next week 
i think the presidents likely to veto either bill or both of 
them in their present form said charles hobbs director of the 
white house office of policy development 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan told 
the meeting he will veto any welfare expansion of the type now 
under consideration in congress 
fitzwater said the legislation under consideration would spend 
billions of dollars to expand the welfare system but without the 
reforms that we think are necessary 
we are especially concerned that the current bill does not 
require recipients of welfare to actually work if they are able to 
do so he said 
reagan also wants a bill that promises waivers of federal red 
tape for states and municipalities wishing to try thier own welfare 
reforms fitzwater said 
hobbs characterized the bill before the senate as an expansion 
of the welfare balloon that simply doesnt do anybody any good 
the bill sponsored by sen daniel p moynihan dny has 62 
cosponsors 
despite the veto threat new jersey gov thomas kean said he 
believes a welfarereform bill can be passed and signed by the 
president this year kean attended the meeting with the president 
were close very very close kean said 
the governor said he believes differences between reagan and 
congress can be addressed when house and senate conferees meet to 
reconcile versions of the bill 
kean said reagan will insist that a final version contain the 
work requirement and the federal waivers otherwise the white 
house appears openminded he said 
reagan met with kean and other delegates to a twoday conference 
on the future of welfare reform also at the session was mayor 
william morris of memphis tenn and several administrators of 
promising selfhelp programs 
fitzwater said the group discussed reagans welfarereform 
strategy unveiled in february 1987 calling for pilot projects 
designed to get people off welfare rolls by making them 
selfsupporting 
congress has not acted on reagans proposal but the president 
has asked his welfare advisory board to work with federal agencies 
and state and local governments to launch demonstration projects in 
at least half of the states by the end of the year 
the board has endorsed projects in new jersey wisconsin ohio 
washington and new york and projects in five other states are under 
active consideration fitzwater said

the white house said friday that iran may try 
to exploit the presidential race in the united states with some 
kind of surprise before the november election 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater made the comment in 
response to a published report that said a national security 
council staff memo had warned that iran may try to use the nine 
american hostages in lebanon as political pawns 
fitzwater said he wouldnt confirm or deny the memo but added 
i think its safe to assume in a kind of commonsense way that 
iran is not above exploiting the elections in our country by some 
means 
the report in the wall street journal said the nsc memo 
suggested iran might offer to release some hostages before the 
elections if vice president george bush would soften the united 
states antiiran stance 
the story said an iranian official had tried to arrange a 
clandestine meeting with a bush aide who was warned off the 
meeting by colleagues 
fitzwater said he was not aware of any overture to bush 
bush during a campaign stop in denver on friday said no i 
dont know anything about it nothing

ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis health 
again is reported to be deteriorating and the 87yearold 
patriarchs chosen successor has met with two senior iranian 
leaders in the past two days 
the official islamic republic news agency reported from tehran 
that ayatollah husseinali montazeri khomeinis handpicked heir 
apparent held separate meetings wednesday and thursday with the 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and with president ali 
khamenei 
it said both men traveled to the holy city of qom 100 miles 
south of tehran for the meetings with montazeri 
they discussed various current issues the agency said but 
it did not elaborate or indicate the meetings were linked to 
khomeinis health 
khomeini has been reported in frail condition since a heart 
attack two years ago and there have been reports he has cancer 
rumors that he was dead or dying have circulated frequently 
he has appeared fragile and slowmoving his speech slow in the 
few recent public appearances broadcast by iranian government 
television khomeini rarely leaves his home in qom and was last 
seen in public a month ago 
the cbs television network said thursday night that intelligence 
reports indicated he may now be very close to death it quoted 
them as saying the ayatollahs cancer has spread from his 
prostate to his liver and he may only have two or three months 
to live 
rafsanjani one of khomeinis closest aides has strengthened 
his political power in the past week at president khameneis 
expense they are rivals in a power struggle within the hierarchy 
to determine who will run the country when khomeini dies 
speculation that the revolutionary leaders condition was 
deteriorating increased when he named rafsanjani 53 acting 
commanderinchief of irans armed forces june 2 khomeini had held 
the title 
his decision clearly was linked to recent military setbacks in 
the 8yearold war with iraq and the need to reorganize the armed 
forces 
tehran radio quoted rafsanjani as saying june 3 it was no longer 
possible for khomeini to personally run the administrative 
affairs of the military he did not elaborate but said we 
should not have such expectations of his holiness 
rafsanjani a middleranking cleric has long been considered 
the second most powerful figure in iran his appointment as 
military chief and reelection june 7 as speaker of the parliament 
were seen as a consolidation of his political power 
he also is khomeinis representative on the supreme defense 
council which determines war strategy has close links with the 
fanatical revolutionary guards and is on several other key 
committees 
khomeinis edict naming rafsanjani military commander said he 
acted at the urging of khamanei chairman of the supreme defense 
council but western analysts saw his use of khameneis name as an 
attempt to avoid publicly humiliating the president 
although khomeini clearly indicated in 1985 that montazeri 65 
would succeed him he drew up a new political testament dec 10 
tehran radio said it contained some changes from an earlier 
document khomeini had made that is to be opened after his death 
the most common speculation is that he wants power held by a 
council of three to five men to avoid political strife that could 
undermine the revolution 
montazeri clearly was angry when rafsanjani became military 
chief and demanded that he relinquish the post as speaker of 
parliament rafsanjani made two fellow radicals deputy speakers so 
they could run parliament while he concentrated on military 
reorganization 
several iranian leaders have opposed montazeris selection as 
successor to khomeini 
he has the required religious status but lacks the patriarchs 
presence and authority and his power base has been eroded by 
rafsanjanis maneuvering 
that combined with khomeinis support for rafsanjani has led 
analysts to believe montazeri will be little more than a 
figurehead with real power in the hands of rafsanjani and other 
politicians

a weeklong barrage of publicity failed to 
turn up the identity of a deaf boy found wandering in mexico and 
authorities decided friday to cancel an outing to shield the 
youngster from overattention 
the 7 or 8yearold boy who authorities believe could be an 
american survivor of a plane crash that killed his family had been 
scheduled to view some airplanes at el paso international airport 
so officials could see whether he recognized any 
child welfare workers in mexico postponed the trip indefinitely 
saying the boy was being spoiled by reporters following him around 
because of too much attention hes been receiving hes 
starting to be a little tiresome said joel bustamante judicial 
director of the system of the integrated family the agency caring 
for the child in ciudad juarez just across the mexican border from 
el paso 
hes not acting like himself said pat ayala spokeswoman 
for the texas department of human services which is working with 
mexican authorities to find the boys relatives 
sabat as the freckled brownhaired boy has been named by his 
mexican guardians has been photographed stared at and entreated 
to draw pictures by reporters from england france mexico and all 
over the united states 
on thursday alone reporters from two oklahoma city tv stations 
visited sabat in addition to a reporter from people magazine and 
two journalists from london ms ayala said the day before 
reporters from the national enquirer took a look at the tyke 
the other kids feel left out ms ayala said 
sabats story is compelling because so little of it is known he 
has impaired hearing and communicates mostly by drawing pictures 
and gesturing his pictures seem to indicate that he survived the 
crash of a fourseat singleengine airplane that killed his 
parents and sister 
he was found wandering near downtown juarez last november with 
scars that look about 2 years old and could come from hometreated 
injuries 
after mexican authorities noticed sabat preferred hamburgers and 
hot dogs over mexican fare and responded more enthusiastically 
toward american cartoon characters they contacted their texas 
counterparts 
the fbi and human services have fielded hundreds of phone calls 
from people offering tips and asking whether they can adopt sabat 
potential adopters have been told they face long odds 
unless were able to make a positive identification as a us 
citizen or even a legal resident he remains in mexican custody 
ms ayala said 
the center for missing and exploited children has supplied the 
fbis el paso office with information on approximately 20 young 
boys who roughly fit sabats description footprints from a missing 
illinois boy who looked like sabat didnt match and no firm leads 
have turned up officials said 
there is some conjecture that sabat is from oklahoma because he 
recognizes the outline of that saucepanshaped state said juan 
ramon hernandez director general of the family agency in juarez 
he also becomes excited and points at himself when he sees a us 
flag hernandez said 
when shown an oklahoma map sabat points vaguely to the 
northwest corner of the state ms ayala said adding its hard 
to tell if he recognizes that part of the state or whether he was 
just playing with his finger

foreign ministers of the nato alliance said 
friday they want soviet advances in human rights before talks begin 
on reducing conventional forces in europe 
the 16 foreign ministers ending the spring meeting of the north 
atlantic council also said the alliance should not relax its 
defense effort despite the improvement in eastwest relations 
a concluding statement said the conference concentrated on 
discussion of the changing political climate in eastern europe 
the need for significant progress on human rights and human 
contacts at the current conference on security and cooperation in 
europe in vienna a followup to the 1975 helsinki agreements 
commitments to share equitably the risks burdens and 
responsibilities as well as the benefits of the common defense 
spokesmen for several delegations said ministers stressed the 
need to get a final statement from the 35nation vienna meeting 
that includes a strong position on human rights 
the meeting is one of several held to evaluate compliance with 
the helsinki accords which were signed by the united states 
canada and all european countries except albania 
negotiations dealing only with troop reductions in central 
europe have limped along for 15 years without result planned 
negotiations between nato and the sevennation communist bloc are 
more ambitious seeking to reduce tensions from the atlantic to the 
ural mountains 
secretary of state george p shultz urged the european allies 
not to be lulled by conciliatory gestures from moscow 
he acknowledged the european nato members may have difficulty 
convincing their parliaments to maintain or raise defense spending 
because of domestic political considerations but added 
i am not satisified that anyone is pulling their weight 
satisfactorily 
lord carrington the nato secretarygeneral said there was 
general agreement among the ministers to keep up our arms 
expenditures 
carrington who will retire at the end of june added at a 
closing news conference there is a certain feeling in europe that 
the united states does not fully understand what europe is doing 
for nato defense 
the declaration did not include a specific promise western 
europe and canada will contribute more to defense costs the united 
states now pays about 70 percent 
nato foreign ministers also welcomed the results of the may 
29june 2 summit in moscow between president reagan and mikhail s 
gorbachev both for their substance and as a portent for the 
future development of eastwest relations 
we welcome the unprecedented prominence accorded to human 
rights in the joint statement of the summit and hope that a more 
forthcoming soviet attitude will also be reflected in the 
concluding document of the vienna conference

defense lawyers asked the house on friday to 
drop impeachment proceedings against imprisoned us district judge 
walter l nixon jr whom they portrayed as the innocent victim of 
big prize fever gripping overzealous federal prosecutors 
he has committed no crime and has engaged in no impeachable 
offense attorney david stewart told a house judiciary 
subcommittee before it concluded less than two days of impeachment 
hearings against the mississippi judge 
nixon 59 is serving a fiveyear prison sentence at eglin air 
force base in florida for lying to a federal grand jury about his 
discussions concerning drug charges against the son of a wealthy 
investor with whom nixon had business dealings 
nixon a federal judge since 1968 continues to draw his 89500 
annual salary while in prison he refused to testify at the 
impeachment proceeding friday on the ground that he had 
insufficient time to prepare for questioning 
former federal prosecutor reid weingarten testified that nixon 
entered into a sweetheart deal with mississippi investor wiley 
fairchild that led to the judges perjury conviction in february 
1986 
nixon bought oil and gas rights in three wells from fairchild 
for 9500 in 1980 and subsequently made a reported 55000 from 
the deal nixon testified at his trial that the transaction was 
legitimate and that he promised no favors to fairchild in return 
nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity from 
fairchild but was convicted on two counts of lying to a grand jury 
when he denied discussing drug smuggling charges against drew 
fairchild with the elder fairchild and with former state district 
attorney paul holmes 
the oil well transaction was obviously a freebie a 
sweetheart deal weingarten said he quoted nixon as telling 
fairchild that if i can help you i will and if i cant ill 
tell you 
but nixon insists that he never spoke to anyone about the drug 
case and says the questions posed when he testified before the 
grand jury were ambiguous stewart his attorney charged friday 
that nixon has been unfairly convicted 
stewart told the house panel that in the early 1980s there was 
a fever abroad in the public integrity section of the justice 
department to convict a federal judge you might even call it 
big prize fever 
he said federal prosecutors embarked on a corruption 
investigation based on a lot of wild accusations by a 
government informant that were never corroborated 
for reasons we do not fully understand to this day judge 
nixon did become the target of the public integrity section he 
became the big prize stewart said the biggest victim of 
this fever has been walter nixon 
stewart conceded that the circumstances are soewhat grim for 
judge nixon because of his perjury conviction and the supreme 
courts denial of his final appeal 
nixons allegation that he was the innocent target of vindictive 
prosecutors is the same defense that another imprisoned federal 
judge harry e claiborne of nevada used without success during 
his senate impeachment trial in october 1986 
claiborne who refused to resign even though he was convicted of 
tax evasion was convicted of high crimes and misdemeanors by 
the senate and was removed from office after the first impeachment 
trial in half a century 
the only other federal judge to be indicted while in office is 
alcee l hastings of miami who was acquitted in 1983 of bribery 
conspiracy 
a separate house judiciary subcommittee completed three weeks of 
hearings thursday on subsequent charges that hastings actually 
committed the crime and tried to conceal his involvement by lying 
under oath and manufacturing evidence at his trial 
nixon has been chief federal judge for the southern district of 
mississippi based in biloxi since 1982

party chairman paul g kirk jr 
appealed to democratic platform writers friday to draft a document 
that addresses concerns of working families not a yellow pages of 
ads for every organized group 
as a 16member drafting committee began work however 
representatives of apparent nominee michael dukakis and rival jesse 
jackson said the discussion paper they started out with a 
2000word document penned by onetime john f kennedy speechwriter 
theodore sorensen was too general 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons emissary said the sorensen 
paper contains almost no specifics 
michael barnes representating dukakis said the platform will 
have to give voters more details on how the democrats will grapple 
with the spread of aids and help the homeless 
we need to indicate where were going and how were going to 
get there he said 
kirk in a brief appearance before leaving this island near 
michigans upper peninsula exhorted the democrats to write with 
the socalled swing voters not special interests in mind 
you never get a second chance to make a first impression 
said kirk who wants a short visionary platform 
the sorensen paper in the form of a declaration by we the 
people of the democratic party denounces voodoo economics 
condemns south africas hateful apartheid governmentsponsored 
terrorism and mentions in passing a need to find more homes 
and food for those who are homeless and hungry and to find more 
aid for those who have aids 
kirk said the party needs a pragmatic principled and positive 
statement that american people can read and reflect upon and say 
thats the kind of country i want my kids to grow up in 
he told reporters the party does not need to spell out dollar 
figures or precise program goals in its platform 
i dont think well end up with the yellow pages an ad for 
every organized group he said 
rep william gray iii the philadelphia congressman and jackson 
supporter who is chairing the drafting sessions assured the panel 
members you are going to write the platform 
he said his goal was not to produce a document this weekend but 
to build a consensus in preparation for next months convention in 
atlanta 
the drafting committee adjourned after a 90minute afternoon 
session in which the members agreed they need strong stands on 
civil rights drugs housing health and education 
gray then met privately with barnes norton and others to try to 
forge common language on those issues he put off until the weekend 
discussion of the economy and foreign affairs 
norton expressed discomfort with the pace telling reporters 
it is going too slowly you dont know what differences you have 
until you get down to cold language 
james b booe secretarytreasurer of the communications workers 
of america and one of the drafters said the democrats need a 
platform that any democrat can run with instead of from not one 
that would get us tangled up with too many specifics 
vermont gov madeleine kunin said the platform should be a 
document school children can read 
but leslie mclemore a political science professor at jackson 
state university in mississippi said there are some school 
children in my state who cannot read and thats why on education 
and other issues we have to be specific 
mclemore a jackson delegate said winning is important but 
winning and losing the very heart and soul of this party and 
misleading the american people is not an enterprise that i wish to 
be a part of 
gray said there will be a draft ready for the full 186member 
platform committee to consider when it meets in denver june 2526 
he said no one expected sorensens paper to be the final word 
as we go through the discussion of issues drugs education 
civil rights health care hopefully theyll realize that their 
differences are not that great and begin to come to a consensus on 
their own gray said 
norton said our concern would only have been if the two 
candidates did not have a free hand to draft the kind of platform 
that they and they alone deserve to draft because they attracted 
the largest number of votes 
she said sorensens language on south africa was one of the 
better parts of this document but still needed to be stronger 
the motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs there 
probably is more the american people would like to have us say 
about drugs she added 
sorensen who will sit on the full platform committee told 
reporters he stood ready to help the drafters but if he was not 
needed i brought my tennis racket

one day after suffering another budgetary blow 
gov michael dukakis said friday the states worsening money 
problems can be managed but he declined to give new details on how 
that might be accomplished 
obviously we have an immediate problem dukakis said 
referring to a shortfall of at least 400 million in the 11 
billion budget for the fiscal year that ends in three weeks 
nearly 100 million of that total became due suddenly on 
thursday when the states highest court ruled in favor of a 
corporate tax abatement 
in his first fullfledged news conference on massachusetts 
issues since clinching the democratic presidential nomination 
dukakis acknowledged that the current tax shortfall is serious but 
he said the state is not broke and stuck to his view that the 
states economy remains healthy 
the governor again declined to specify which taxraising 
measures he supports if any beyond the 70 million he has 
proposed to gain by bringing the state income tax code in line with 
federal changes 
dukakis was asked if he supports a proposed 40 million tax on 
cigarettes or other new taxes 
thats an open question at this point he said the need for 
taxes depends on how much savings government can realize by scaling 
back planned expansions for next year and by trimming the cost of 
longterm nursing home care he indicated 
dukakis also repeated his desire to capture a projected 38 
million in unclaimed bottle deposits held by bottlers although 
legislative leaders have said firmly they hold little hope for 
claiming those funds 
all of these issues are on the table all of them involve 
savings and revenue dukakis said promising that a solution to 
balance the budget would evolve 
for next fiscal year dukakis initially proposed spending nearly 
12 billion but he has trimmed that request in may the house cut 
spending plans further sending an 118 billion package to the 
senate which is drafting its own budget plans now 
dukakis said that because the house did not adopt all of his 
proposals to reduce spending there is room for more cuts

sen mitch mcconnell the senior republican on 
a senate subcommittee investigating latin american drug dealing 
angrily accused panel chairman john kerry on friday of using the 
issue as a political weapon against vice president george bush 
mcconnell accused the massachusetts democrat of setting up a 
series of hearings into drugrunning operations that put reagan 
administration antidrug efforts in a bad light while refusing to 
hear testimony from administration witnesses 
the subcommittee is being conducted as if it were a division 
of the dukakis campaign mcconnell said in a reference to likely 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
bush has been a central figure in those efforts first as head 
of the south florida antidrug task force then as chief of the 
administrations overall drug interdiction effort 
the investigation has deteriorated into a biased partisan 
agenda designed to selectively criticize and condemn rather than 
work toward constructive solutions mcconnell rky told 
reporters 
a year and a half of requests to hear from the administration 
witnesses to discuss policy plans and options regarding 
international drug trafficking have been ignored he said 
mcconnell accused kerry and his staff of spinning out a story 
told by convicted drug dealers of dubious credibility of declining 
to schedule witnesses who might dispute that story and of leaking 
information to the press to suit their political goals mcconnell 
has not attended the hearings 
specifically he said kerry has declined to allow felix 
rodriguez a former cia agent and friend of bush to rebut claims 
by one previous witness that rodriguez was involved in channeling 
drug profits to nicaraguas contra rebels 
in a statement read at mcconnells news conference friday 
rodriguez said he had only met the man who made the charge 
convicted money launderer ramon milian rodriguez on one occasion 
milian rodriguez told him in passing that he might be able to 
provide money from the drug operation for the contras rodriguez 
said 
the meeting on jan 18 1985 was at the office of raul diaz a 
former lawenforcement officer and now a private investigator who 
put rodriguez in touch with the drug trafficker he said he said 
he passed the information to the fbi and the cia but did not 
otherwise follow up at that time rodriguez said he had never met 
bush 
responding to the charges kerry accused mcconnell in turn of 
trying to politicize the drug issue 
i am saddened by my colleagues decision to separate himself 
from a serious investigation that has required an awful lot of hard 
work over the course of three years kerry said in a statement 
we have tried to include him in the process i regret that for 
reasons of his own he has chosen to politicize the ongoing work of 
the subcommittee as we seek to expose the connections between law 
enforcement foreign policy and narcotics 
kerry said his committee still plans to invite administration 
witnesses including john c lawn head of the drug enforcement 
administration rodriguez also is expected to be called to testify 
as well as the former head of the south florida antidrug task 
force adm daniel murphy 
kerrys chief aide on the investigation jack blum said he had 
been discussing future witness lists with mcconnell as recently as 
last week and said he was astonished at the complaints 
kerrys foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism narcotics 
and international operations has held a series of hearings on the 
latin american drug trade including the widespread influence of 
the colombian medellin cocaine cartel 
while mcconnell has not been present for the hearings 
republican new york sen alfonse damato who is not a member of 
the subcommittee has been present and participated in questioning 
much of the time

cardinal john oconnor of new york said friday his 
first 48 hours in the soviet union left him uncertain about the 
reality of change here but he voiced hope soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev was sincere in his desire for reform 
mr gorbachev is confronted with tremendous problems 
oconnor the archbishop of new york said in a telephone 
interview i think anyone in his right mind prays mr gorbachev 
is sincere and wants to bring about a new era 
oconnor and nine other roman catholic cardinals are in moscow 
for celebrations marking the 1000th anniversary of the russian 
orthodox church an event being accorded extraordinary prominence 
by authorities in this officially atheistic state 
oconnor is the highestranking american catholic in the largest 
vatican delegation ever to visit the country evangelist billy 
graham is also visiting the soviet union for the millennium 
celebration 
earlier friday oconnor and other visiting dignitaries attended 
a gala meeting at moscows bolshoi theatre marking the millennium 
of the mass baptism carried out in 988 by prince vladimir of kiev 
the rite that founded the russian church 
raisa gorbachev the soviet leaders wife was also present 
oconnor said the presence of mrs gorbachev who once was a 
teacher of marxismleninism and the official exposure being given 
the event here had stunned the leaders of the russian church 
oconnor noted he had only arrived wednesday and had only had 
time for impressions and guesses about how gorbachevs drive 
for glasnost or openness had affected religious believers in 
the soviet union 
anyone who wants to be honest is in a bit of a dilemma 
oconnor said writing it off as a charade would be as tragic as 
if we bought it lock stock and barrel 
soviet authorities are currently rewriting laws on religion to 
allow believers more latitude in expressing their faith but 
oconnor said deprivations and persecutions continued against 
the ukrainian catholic church which is not recognized by soviet 
authorities 
oconnor also said dramatic changes were needed in the treatment 
of soviet jewry 
he said he believed russian church leaders knew that once the 
foreign delegations left things could go back to subnormal in 
soviet churchstate relations 
oconnor began his day by celebrating mass at st louis roman 
catholic church in moscow as he did thursday said monsignor james 
mccarthy the cardinals secretary 
four other cardinals and 12 priests were also in attendance 
mccarthy said as well as two bishops one from the soviet republic 
of lithuania and the other from vietnam 
on saturday oconnor is scheduled to take part in an evening 
vigil at the trinity cathedral of moscows danilov monastery 
conducted by patriach pimen the head of the russian church 
the next day is the russian orthodox equivalent of all saints 
day known as sunday of all saints who shone forth in the land of 
russia and one of the holiest days on the churchs calendar 
oconnor is scheduled to return to new york on june 15

the house ethics committee announced friday it 
will conduct an official inquiry into accusations that seaker jim 
wright violated house conflictofinterest rules in his financial 
dealings 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the panel six 
democrats and six republicans unanimously approved a 
preliminary inquiry in the matter of speaker james wright 
the speaker of the house has been notified and has pledged his 
full cooperation he said 
wright proclaimed his innocence and denied using his office for 
personal gain my goal and just about my only professional goal 
in living at this point is to be a good and effective public 
servant he said in a statement 
it was only the second time since the ethics committee was 
created 21 years ago that it has investigated a speaker of the 
house former speaker thomas p oneill jr dmass was 
investigated and cleared as part of the korean influence scandal a 
decade ago 
wright accompanied by his lawyer met with reporters for nearly 
two hours before the committee announcement answering questions 
and providing papers he said refuted the charges against him 
the texas democrat repeated his assertion that his troubles were 
the result of republicans seeking to deflect charges of sleaze in 
the reagan administration 
i dont think theres any question but that theyre 
politically motivated he said of the accusations although 
republicans would still be critical even if they were not 
themselves under attack i dont think there would have been a 
formal charge and all this fanfare he said 
the committee listed six areas in which actions taken by house 
speaker james c wright jr may have resulted in violations of 
the code of official conduct or a law rule regulation or other 
standard of conduct 
the circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts for a friend and 
constituent richard moncrief with whom wright had an interest in 
a private gas well venture 
the circumstances surrounding wrights intervention on behalf 
of texas oil amp gas co in a matter before the interior department 
whether campaign fuds were used to help pay for publication of 
wrights book reflections of a public man from which he 
received a 55 percent royalty totaling some 55000 
whether wright improperly detailed a congressional aide and 
used his office expense accounts to complete work on the book 
wrights use of a condominium in fort worth texas which 
belonged to a son of his friend and business partner george 
mallick for which wright reportedly paid a per diem and expenses 
but no monthly rent 
the possible exercise of undue influence in dealings with 
officials of the federal home loan bank board on behalf of texas 
savings and loan institutions 
the committee went beyond the scope of inquiry suggested by rep 
newt gingrich rga who filed the official complaint against the 
speaker 
gingrich had cited the book contract and the oil company 
dealings common cause a group that advocates tighter government 
ethics asked for an investigation of wrights activities on behalf 
of the bankers 
gingrich said he was pleased with the ethics committees 
decision 
i think its good for the country i think its good for the 
house as an institution that 12 members on a bipartisan basis 
have voted to investigate the speaker gingrich said 
wrights lawyer william oldaker said he believed the committee 
known officially as the committee on standards of official 
conduct had no need for an outside counsel as gingrich had 
suggested oldaker expressed confidence the speaker would be 
exonerated 
the decision to launch a preliminary inquiry was the normal 
procedure when a member presented a case that could if true 
constitute a violation oldaker said 
the committee has the power to bring charges before the full 
house which can result in disciplinary action the most rare and 
severe of which would be expulsion 
the speaker had been largely unavailable to discuss details of 
the accusations until friday when he launched what appeared to be 
an allout effort that included lengthy interviews with print and 
broadcast reporters 
he also released a 23page statement along with documents he 
said supported point by point his claims he had done nothing 
wrong after the committee announcement the speakers office 
released an additional statement regarding the condominium 
the speaker said he had no financial interest in the oil company 
cases which date from the late 1970s his efforts included giving 
a letter to the late egyptian president anwar sadat 
intervention on behalf of failing texas savings and loan 
institutions he said was in the nature of my duties as 
speaker he said he had merely asked regulators to hear the 
cases of his constituents he said and published reports implying 
anything else were just pure fiction he said 
wright defended his book deal denying that he was given the 
high royalties as a return from the nearly 300000 in business his 
campaigns had given the company owned by the publisher his friend 
william carlos moore 
theres nothing wrong with the arrangement to publish the 
book he said 
he also insisted that the staff member who worked on the project 
did so as a volunteer and that taxpayers received full value when 
they financed the employees trip to fort worth for the project 
regarding the condominium which wright subsequently purchased 
for 58500 wright said the owner had no interest in legislation 
and that if he had not used it it would have remained vacant 
to the degree i have ever or may have erred it would be a 
mistake of the head not a mistake of the heart he said

the army arrested a 
26yearold palestinian suspected of stabbing an israeliappointed 
arab mayor and bulldozed his cinderblock house friday in the 
jelazoun refugee camp 
the army said khamis jawdat faraj had stalked hassan tawil 74 
the mayor of el bireh and knifed him as an act of palestinian 
nationalism tawil was critically wounded 
elsewhere in the west bank troops ordered about 100 israelis 
out of the village of beita where the israelis were planting olive 
trees to protest the armys uprooting of orchards and demolition of 
14 arab houses 
the uprootings and demolitions were in retaliation for an april 
6 clash between villagers and israeli settlers in which two 
palestinians and a 15yearold jewish girl were killed 
prime minister yitzhak shamir returned from a fiveday trip to 
the united states and told reporters he urged soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze to support direct peace talks between 
israel and its arab neighbors 
the army said in a statement it arrested faraj on thursday night 
a large yellow bulldozer leveled the threeroom house where 
faraj lived with his 60yearold mother only an almond tree plum 
tree and rose bush were left standing 
before sending about a dozen vehicles and two bulldozers into 
jelazoun the army imposed a curfew and cut electricity to the camp 
where about 5000 palestinians live it is about 20 miles north of 
jerusalem 
troops removed belongings from the house and found marxist and 
palestinian nationalist literature inside then one of the 
bulldozers rumbled up to the onestory house and knocked it down 
raising a huge cloud of dust 
they are destroying our house i dont know what for said 
nozha faraj as she watched the demolition from a neighbors home 
the army said her son had been detained several times previously 
for alleged participation in antiisraeli disturbances 
according to the daily haaretz tawil who was stabbed tuesday 
was able to identify his assailant tawil told israel television 
the man asked him for help in obtaining a passport before stabbing 
him 
in beita troops uprooted the trees being planted by an israeli 
group called committee for beita they threw one of the 
saplings onto the highway the move prompted the israelis to shout 
shoot the trees 
the israeli group seeks reparations to villagers whose homes 
were destroyed or damaged by the army in punishment for the clash 
jewish settlers and the army initially blamed arab villagers for 
the death of israeli teenager tirza porat but an army report 
later determined she was killed by a bullet fired by an israeli 
guarding the group 
according to un figures 204 palestinians and two israelis 
have been killed since the uprising began on dec 8 about 5000 
arabs have been injured and 5000 arrested 
after moslem prayers in gaza city on friday troops fired tear 
gas to disperse about 50 protesters who threw rocks at soldiers 
from rooftops and chanted plo israel no 
also friday arab newspapers reported the army arrested two more 
palestinian reporters and a writer the army has detained 21 arab 
journalists for six months without trial to try to curb the 
palestinian press which it blames for inciting unrest 
shamir said he told shevardnadze at their meeting in new york he 
opposes an international conference on middle east peace we know 
what we want and we dont think a conference of all kinds of 
countries should decide our fate he said 
the soviets favor such a conference which would include 
america the soviet union france britain and china as the five 
permanent members of the un security council but shamir says 
israel would be outnumbered and pressured to make territorial 
concessions 
the government press office reinstated the press credentials of 
nbc television correspondent martin fletcher after a sixweek 
suspension 
israel suspended the credentials of fletcher and washington post 
correspondent glenn frankel on april 26 accusing them of violating 
military censorship by reporting that israel was responsible for 
the assassination of plo military commander khalil wazir in tunisia 
on april 16 the government has refused comment on reports of its 
involvement 
frankels credentials were returned in may

this tiny mining town on the tug river got a 
less than flattering portrayal in a book written by a native son 
who said crum was a boring place where nothing ever changes but the 
weather 
crum a novel by lee maynard has been on the bookshelves 
for two weeks but its hard to find in these parts the only local 
store that stocked it the savrite nearby in kermit sold its two 
copies right away 
i didnt think highly of the book said crum resident lorrie 
perry it was not one id put on the library shelf 
maynard picked his hometown of 300 on the west virginiakentucky 
border as the subject of his first book published by washington 
square press a division of simon amp schuster 
during the winters in crum the days were long boring and 
cold and during the summers the days were long boring and hot 
maynard wrote in crum only the temperature changed 
maynard 52 said he intended much of the 189page book to be 
funny but it was based on fact theres a kernel of truth in 
every page in every paragraph said maynard who was known as 
amos lee when he lived in the town 
residents disagree especially about the salty language 
maynards characters use 
we didnt use language like that that was shocking said 
one resident who asked not to be named in deference to maynards 
parents who moved to kenova about 30 miles away when maynard was 
14 
i really had a high regard for him said one upset resident 
amos lee was a very allamerican type it didnt sound like the 
amos lee i knew 
the story follows a nameless protagonist through four seasons of 
his high school senior year during the 1950s hes not the fastest 
smartest or strongest boy in his gang 
hes just the one who wants out of crum the most 
i tried for years to figure out how our gang worked and i 
guess it was sort of like a stew the protagonist writes the 
boys were tasteless chunks of things floating around in the pot 
mostly unidentifiable but sort of gristly if you bit into them 
with the girls as the spices and the heat 
living in crum made such an impact on me maynard said to 
this day i dont know if the impact was good or bad i had such a 
desire to leave it was a weight on my shoulders 
ralph dawson the principal of crum elementary school who was a 
year or two behind maynard in school said he remembers crum 
differently from the author 
it was a very active community he said 
maynard who now lives in sante fe nm has been back only 
once 
i drove in had a cup of coffee and got in my car and drove 
away i got very tense while i was in there he said have you 
been to crum its a strange place

pornography through the mail and is the subject of a broader child 
molestation probe officials said friday 
the teacher assigned to the departments dependents school 
program in panama since september 1985 was arrested on june 4 
after voluntarily traveling from panama to atlanta ga the us 
southern command said in a statement 
he has been assigned to a post outside the classroom since 
november 
the 34yearold teacher whom the command identified as cirio 
lopez jr surrendered to us authorities in atlanta for 
allegedly using the us mail to receive child pornography 
the command said lopez was a us citizen and secondgrade 
teacher who is an admitted homosexual suffering aids 
lopez is being charged with violation of title 18 and us 
postal regulations for the possession of two magazines containing 
child pornography the materials were discovered through the us 
postal system in atlanta 
the command said lopez had begun teaching second grade at the 
diablo elementary school in the panama canal zone in september 
1985 after a previous assignment at a defense department school in 
west germany earlier he taught in an unidentified public school 
system in colorado the command said 
however mr lopez voluntarily removed himself from classroom 
teaching last november after he informed school officials that he 
had aids because of the seriousness of these charges and mr 
lopez association with schoolage male children an investigation 
is under way to determine any further possible misconduct on his 
part 
the command added that so far it knew of fewer than 10 
older children who had associated with lopez by attending 
baseball games or movies with him 
a special team will conduct indepth interviews with students 
and parents concerning any possible misconduct on the part of mr

according to the command lopez acknowledged he was a homosexual 
after symptoms of aids were noted in october 1987 at the gorgas 
army hospital in panama 
his students and their parents were not informed he had the

who has aids unless he or she is debilitated and cannot perform his 
job the us public health service has stated that casual contact 
with aids patients does not place others at risk of getting the 
illness

classroom at the regional dodds office at albrook air force station 
to work with a curriculum development project he has not been in 
the classroom since nov 23 1987

condemned serial childkiller 
arthur gary bishop went to his execution friday begging 
forgiveness but the families of his victims say it wont come from 
them 
i know he was sick but to forgive him i cant forgive him 
for taking my sons life i just dont understand why he couldnt 
have let him go said debbie fisher robinson whose son alonzo 
daniels 4 bishop killed in 1979 
bishop 36 was the 99th inmate executed in the united states 
since a 1976 us supreme court ruling ended a nationwide 
moratorium on capital punishment 
he was pronounced dead at 1216 am about eight minutes after 
two executioners at utah state prison injected him with deadly 
chemicals 
give my apologies to the families of the victims were 
bishops last words said warden gerald cook 
a former eagle scout excommunicated mormon missionary and a 
bookkeeper by profession bishop ended all further appeals after 
the utah supreme court in february rejected his arguments against 
the death penalty 
he was convicted in 1984 of kidnapping five salt lake county 
boys between 1979 and 1983 the victims ages 4 to 13 were 
variously shot bludgeoned strangled and drowned because bishop 
feared exposure as a child molester 
a homosexual pedophile bishop confessed to police he was glad 
he had been caught because he couldnt control his lust for young 
boys and would likely have killed again 
in a handwritten statement released after his execution bishop 
said he had allowed himself to be misled by satan and as a 
result my life has been marked by wicked perverse and depraved 
actions 
he said that by ending his appeals he was not trying to be 
heroic but accepting my just punishment though perhaps too 
little too late i am doing the right thing now he wrote 
bishop also used his final statement to deny pernicious 
rumors that he was guilty of other slayings than the five for 
which he was convicted and that he was sexually abused as a child 
reaction from the families of bishops victims was laced with 
bitterness 
claude and loralee petersen said they are struggling to prevent 
their pain and anger over bishops 1980 slaying of their 
11yearold son kim from consuming them the petersens said the 
execution offered them no relief 
its still a form of violence and we dont want to focus on 
that at all they said 
shona cunningham whose 13yearold son graeme was bishops 
last victim said she could not bring herself to grant bishops 
plea for forgiveness contained in a february letter to her and 
other victims relatives 
i told him its not my jurisdiction she said of her written 
response the only one bishop received from victims families i 
told him he was right there cant be a happy ending to this one 
hours before bishops execution about 70 people gathered on a 
hill overlooking the prison to hold a candlelight vigil protesting 
capital punishment the vigil was sponsored jointly by amnesty 
international and the utah coalition to abolish the death penalty 
a handful of people favoring the execution stood nearby and 
shouted justice has been served

to implement the great arab maghreb but gave not details of the 
proposals put forward 
delegation sources said ben ali proposed a gradual integration 
of some of the regions political institutions including the five 
parliaments while hassan suggested a stepbystep approach 
beginning with integration of the small multinational corporations 
in the five nations 
the sources said taya urged a closer relationship and bendjedid 
suggested that maghreb unity should begin with limited economic 
integration 
all of the leaders at the luncheon took part in the threeday 
arab summit meeting earlier in the week that restated arab 
endorsement of the palestine liberation organization and its 
chairman yasser arafat they arab leaders also promised a 118 
million annual subsidy to support the uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
in resolutions on the iraniraq war the summit accused iran of 
using terrorism in the conflict that action was denounced friday 
by iranian president ali khamenei 
at a weekly prayer meeting in tehran khamenei said the 
resolutions are a disgrace to the arab world and will remain 
as a stain of shame on the skirts of the arab reactionary leaders 
forever his remarks were carried on tehran radio 
the resolutions condemning iran said it was trying to create 
unrest in the persian gulf states and blamed it for attacks on 
kuwait and for instigating riots that led to more than 400 deaths 
during last years moslem pilgrimage in mecca saudi arabia 
as gadhafi left the meeting to fly home he embraced each of the 
other leaders all but bendjedid are known for their close 
relations with the united states 
at a meeting of the main summit wednesday gadhafi told those 
with good relations with the united states they could go to 
hell but he later apologized 
gadhafi long has advocated arab unity in almost any form in the 
19 years since he seized power he has tried and failed to merge his 
country with all of libyas neighbors and with some arab nations 
far from libyas borders 
his proposal for a merger of the armed forces came like 
lightning out of the blue sky a delegation source said 
the source speaking with the condition he not be identified 
reported gadhafi said the unity of the maghreb nations would be a 
point of transition toward the total arab unity to which we 
should all aspire 
gadhafi said that at the maghreb level the unity should begin 
with the unification of the regions armed forces followed by the 
economic social and political integration the source said 
a merger of the armed forces would create an army of 765000 
but summit sources said the integration does not seem immediately 
feasible 
algerias armed forces are the largest in the region with 
350000 men almost entirely equipped with sovietbloc weapons 
libya also has a sovietsupplied arsenal but its armed forces total 
110000 military personnel including auxiliary units 
morocco tunisia and mauritania have some 305000 troopers 
equipped mainly with french and americanmade weapons

michael dukakis disparaged republican george bush on friday for 
a losing strategy of attacking the democrats background but 
bush retorted that i am not going to be deterred from telling the 
truth 
with the apparent presidential nominees swapping general 
election rhetoric jesse jackson denounced continuing questions 
about what jesse wants he called such questions demeaning 
disrespectful and contemptuous and said his supporters arent 
focused solely on whether or not dukakis chooses him as running 
mate 
they do not have a fixation on one position jackson told 
reporters in southern california where he took a brief working 
vacation 
jackson said he and his supporters have other concerns even as 
democratic officials meeting in michigan expressed optimism they 
could craft a party platform to dukakis liking that would also 
meet jacksons standards 
rep william gray iii of pennsylvania the drafting committee 
chairman said at the opening session on mackinac island mich 
as we go through the discussion of issues drugs education 
civil rights health care hopefully theyll realize that their 
differences are not that great and begin to come to a consensus on 
their own 
in boston dukakis was asked how he planned to respond to 
attacks in which bush called him an elitist with close ties to 
harvard university 
i dont he said im going to campaign on the issues im 
going to talk about the future 
asked if he would bring up bushs background which includes 
yale university dukakis retorted 
i really am not interested i dont think the american people 
are interested i think thats a losing strategy 
bush didnt retreat an inch from the attacks he had made 
thursday saying the democrats are trying to hide the massachusetts 
governors liberal stands 
theres this whole concept that hes a conservative and all 
bush said its a game plan by the democrats to protect him from 
his record 
bush in denver for the first of three unity rallies planned 
across the country by the republican national committee complained 
about dukakis campaign aides saying he is mudslinging 
youre looking at a guy whos been getting hit for six months 
guilt by association and all kinds of personal attacks the vice 
president said what happens now they raise the mudslinging 
thing this is going to be a fun campaign 
in his speech to the gop faithful bush said its my job now 
not just to say what im for but to give the american people the 
facts about governor dukakis 
i am not going to be deterred from telling the truth he 
said 
four of the vice presidents former rivals sen bob dole of 
kansas rep jack kemp of new york former delaware gov pete du 
pont and former secretary of state alexander haig were on hand 
for the denver rally only pat robertson said he could not make it 
the massachusetts governor faced questions about whether he 
would move the us embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv 
a very touchy issue in the middle east jerusalem a holy city in 
three major religious traditions is claimed by jews and arabs in 
the regional conflict 
first he said the embassy should go where the host nation 
says its capital is 
pressed on specifics on jerusalem which israel claims as its 
capital dukakis finally said id put our embassy there 
secretary of state george shultz said earlier friday that such a 
move would ruin middle east peace efforts 
it would be a gigantic mistake and its shocking that anybody 
would make such a proposal said shultz 
the massachusetts governor spent the day in boston working 
mostly on state business and had lunch with former president 
carter 
dukakis said his lunch with carter was terrific and that 
lots of things were dicussed the democratic nomineetobe 
would not be more specific about his talks with carter whom bush 
frequently cites as a negative example of the kind of president 
dukakis would be 
in michigan dukakis and jackson representatives made it clear 
they thought a firstdraft platform dicussion paper prepared by 
former presidential speechwriter theodore sorensen was short on 
specifics gray assured the drafters they were in charge 
our concern would only have been if the two candidates did not 
have a free hand to draft the kind of platform that they and they 
alone deserve to draft because they attracted the largest number 
of votes said eleanor holmes norton representing jackson 
democratic party chief paul kirk was still pushing his dream of 
a short readable platform 
i dont think well end up with the yellow pages an ad for 
every organized group he said 
in washington a white house aide suggested iran might try to 
exploit the presidential race by some means according to the 
wall street journal the newspaper reported that a national 
security council memo warned that american hostages held in lebanon 
by groups friendly to iran could be pawns in an iranian ploy 
the paper also said an iranian official recently tried to 
arrange a secret meeting with a bush aide bush asked about that 
said no i dont know anything about it nothing

cheer a ripple of laughter passed through the crowd after a un 
official asked for more restraint in calling for world peace 
a 6yearold organization called perhaps kids meeting kids 
can make a difference organized what it called a childrens 
summit the weeklong gathering coincides with the 159member 
general assemblys special session on disarmament 
for the past two weeks presidents foreign ministers prime 
ministers and un delegates have been addressing the general 
assembly with calls for disarmament 
on friday the children ranging in age from 6 through 14 met in 
the lobby to give a representative of secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar a statement after five days of discussions on 
peace 
we are happy that countries are now meeting and beginning to 
destroy weapons in their nuclear arsenals said part of their 
statement we are also aware that new and more sophisticated 
weapons are being built to replace them 
we would like you to be aware that we know this and that it

talking and not by fighting the statement was read by a 
sucession of children and then presented to johan nordenfelt from

the governing united national party 
won 36 the 53 district council seats in the southern province 
according to results released friday by the elections department 
the elections were marred by three days of terrorist attacks 
that left at least 12 people dead most of the killings were blamed 
on extremists of the sinhalese ethnic majority who opposed the 
elections 
fifteen seats went to the united socialist alliance a coalition 
of leftist parties and independents won the other two the 
election was held thursday 
the government party has won control of all seven district 
councils for which elections have been held those in the 
tamildominated northern and eastern regions have been delayed by 
fighting between indian peacekeeping troops and tamil rebels but 
the government hopes to hold them next month 
council elections were required under the agreement sri lanka 
and india signed last july in an attempt to end the tamil 
separatist war which has taken more than 8000 lives since it 
began in 1983 
guerrillas of the tamil ethnic minority who want a separate 
homeland in the north and east to be called eelam were to lay down 
their arms in exchange for more autonomy in those regions 
the largest group refused however and india has more than 
50000 soldiers in sri lanka trying to stop the rebellion 
tamils most of whom are hindus make up 18 percent of the 
islands 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority 
sinhalese a predominantly buddhist ethnic group that controls the 
government and army 
sinhalese extremists contend the peace agreement made too many 
concessions to tamils and said they would kill anyone who supports 
the accord they were blamed for outbreaks of preelection violence

britons who make videotapes of television programs 
would be forced to erase or destroy such tapes within 28 days under 
a law proposed by the conservative party government 
the measure which could become law this summer is aimed at 
preventing viewers from building up home libraries with videotapes 
of television shows and films depriving copyright holders of 
royalties 
opposition leaders have called the proposal unenforceable 
how is it going to be policed asked austin mitchell the 
labor partys trade and industry spokesman are we going to start 
marketing tapes that automatically explode 28 days after they have 
been used for the first time 
prime minister margaret thatchers government made the proposal 
as an amendment to the copyright designs and patents bill of 1956 
a house of commons committee approved the amendment by a vote of 
117 thursday 
susie hughes a spokeswoman for the department of trade and 
industry said friday the amendment relaxes retrictions on 
timeshifting the taping of programs to be watched later 
because it gives viewers a 28day grace period 
timeshifting is illegal under the international berne 
convention on copyrights which britain signed but the restriction 
is rarely enforced 
ms hughes said the measure would make timeshifting a civil 
crime clearing the way for copyright holders to sue for damages to 
be determined by a court 
bob montgomery chairman of the mechanical copyright protection 
society complained that the measure did not go far enough 
mrs thatchers consumer affairs minister francis maude said 
the government was trying to balance the interests of viewers and 
copyright owners 
he was asked in a bbctv interview how the government would 
enforce the measure and he said he thought viewers would comply 
voluntarily 
we are not going to set up a force of tape police breaking 
into peoples homes to investigate their video libraries that is 
obviously absurd he said 
ms hughes said the copyright bill probably would complete the 
committee stage in a few weeks and then go for a vote of the full 
house of commons 
it then will go back to the house of lords where it originated 
for final approval she said

south africa entered a third 
year of emergency rule friday with tighter controls on opposition 
activity and critics predicted that such measures will become a 
permanent way of governing 
president pw bothas third emergency proclamation friday means 
hundreds of prominent activists will remain in jail without charge 
the decree tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activity 
and made it illegal to promote a boycott of october municipal 
elections 
the government in february banned the activities of 17 major 
antiapartheid groups most of those groups have called on blacks 
to refrain from voting in elections held by the whitedominated 
government until blacks have equal voting rights on a national 
level 
the reagan administration which had opposed imposition of tough 
sanctions against south africa but was forced to act by congress 
had only a brief comment on the latest development 
this action underscores the need for a dialogue between the 
government and the black opposition to bring about a fully 
functioning nonracial democracy said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
the emergency which first went into effect june 12 1986 now 
will be extended for a year 
bothas announcement of the extension came two days after blacks 
ended their largest and longest general strike against the 
government black labor federations said friday that 2000 workers 
who joined the protest have been fired and 1000 more subjected to 
various disciplinary actions 
botha said the government hopes conditions will improve so that 
the emergency can be lifted 
but anglican archbishop desmond tutu said the emergency 
extension is a pointless and bankrupt exercise which 
aggravates south africas crisis 
helen suzman a veteran parliamentarian who opposes apartheid 
said we might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent 
state of emergency 
the critics included mangosuthu buthelezi chief minister of the 
kwazulu semiautonomous homeland and one of the black leaders whom 
pretoria wants to include in negotiations on a powersharing system 
that would retain white rule 
the tragedy of the south african situation is that nobody 
really had any hope that the national state of emergency would be 
lifted he said south africa seems to be caught up in a 
situation in which dying apartheid requires more defense than it 
ever required 
the new regulations make it illegal to quote members of the 17 
banned antiapartheid organizations and prohibit newspapers from 
quoting any member of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement 
the anc is the main group fighting south africas government and 
apartheid under which the nations 26 million blacks have no voice 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
government 
the regulations also forbid newspapers from saying that their 
journalists were ordered away from any scene of unrest and 
indicating in other ways that their news stories are incomplete 
because of the emergency restrictions 
another new section requires local news agencies except for the 
south african press association the largest to register with 
the government 
the small domestic news agencies many of them aggressive in 
their coverage of antiapartheid activity could be ordered to 
submit all their dispatches to a government censor before 
publication the regulations say 
the new rules mean no information about very important 
political movements in the country will be available said wynand 
malan former member of bothas national party who now leads a 
separate movement in parliament 
a vigil for the estimated 2500 detainees currently held under 
the emergency was conducted at johannesburgs central methodist 
church monitoring groups said 500 to 1000 of the detainees have 
been held for two years 
white women from the black sash civil rights group on friday 
stood along highways in johannesburg with posters saying 
apartheid is the emergency 
the anc said in a statement from its headquarters in zambia that 
the government sought to ensure its survival by continuing to 
resort to the most brutal repression the anc called for 
comprehensive mandatory sanctions against south africa and said 
its guerrillas must escalate their attacks 
the governments bureau for information said the emergency had a 
positive effect it said 91 percent of all black local governments 
were operating normally and 85 percent of the positions for black 
township councilmen were full black school attendance was at 80 
percent it said 
it gave no figures for unrest incidents deaths and injuries 
but they have been sharply down over the past year

the foreign office said britain and iran reached 
agreement friday on a compensation deal for damage inflicted on 
their embassies in violent incidents 
iran is expected to net about 16 million as a result of the 
deal reached after three days of talks in london between british 
and iranian officials 
broad agreement has been reached on the basis of the proposals 
put forward by the british government in may 1987 said a foreign 
office statement 
under those proposals iran will pay britain for damage 
inflicted by mobs on the british embassy and associated buildings 
in tehran in the late 1970s and britain will pay a larger sum for 
the burning of the iranian embassy in london during a 1980 hostage 
siege and rescue 
the iranian embassy declined comment on the talks 
british newspapers and politicians of the governing conservative 
party have welcomed the negotiations they say the negotiations may 
lead to improved relations with iran and better chances of freeing 
western hostages at least two of whom are british held by 
proiranian kidnappers in lebanon

marines in riot gear helped arrest 14 
antiwar protesters friday at the concord naval weapons station a 
few hours after a gathering marked a year of almost daily peace 
demonstrations at the base 
those arrested were expected to be booked for investigation of 
misdemeanor trespassing said lt jd sizemore a contra costa 
county sheriffs deputy 
the confrontation involving the marines occurred without 
violence at a base gate near what the demonstrators say is a bunker 
containing nuclear weapons base officials do not comment on 
whether nuclear material is present 
the demonstrators marched to the gate after a morning gathering 
at which they were addressed by s brian willson who lost his legs 
sept 1 when he was hit by a train at the base while protesting 
weapons shipments to central america 
willson and other speakers spoke to about 200 people as a fabric 
dove of peace flapped above in a gentle breeze a banner nearby 
read stopping the war starts here 
i feel great willson told a reporter with all these 
people here how can i not feel good 
he bristled when asked what he felt he had accomplished 
i dont base expressions of conscience on what im 
accomplishing im expressing what i feel and sharing it with the 
rest of these people here 
im more committed than ever to wage unconditional peace 
in his speech willson said it gives me great joy to be here 
with you all who have made this place so sacred and empowered 
the human spirit and the truth cannot be squashed he said 
the spirit of gandhi and king and jesus and buddha cannot be 
squashed no matter how many bombs and weapons are manufactured and 
unleased in incredible diabolical policies on this earth 
the willson incident and the yearlong vigil have spawned 
lawsuits including several charging sheriffs deputies with using 
excessive force while arresting demonstrators blocking train tracks 
protesters won an injunction barring a county plan to remove 
tables and other material from the side of the highway after 
complaints and petitions bearing 800 signatures from residents of 
the nearby town of clyde 
willson also is suing seeking damages for the loss of both legs 
at the knee when he was struck by a train hauling 28 tons of 
munitions to the military reservation 
the train crew has countersued charging willson and others 
planned to be hit to halt the train and claiming they suffered 
mental anguish after the incident 
house investigators said in march that willson and base 
officials shared equal blame for the accident 
willson a vietnam veteran law school graduate and unsuccessful 
candidate for sheriff in chautauqua ny won praise in soviet 
newspapers and a heros welcome when he and other activists visited 
nicaragua in march

republican george bush said friday that democratic 
rival michael dukakis resorted to the oldest ploy in the game 
by accusing bush of using dirty campaign tactics 
already were hearing charges of mudslinging from the other 
side bush told a unity gathering featuring four of his 
vanquished gop rivals as well as republican officials and activists 
from western states 
earlier bush told reporters he had shifted his campaign into a 
more aggressive attack on the massachusetts governor after 
getting hit for six months by the democrats this is going to 
be a fun campaign the vice president said 
in his speech bush said i look forward to the next two 
months because this is the defining time this is the time when 
the american people will begin to focus on who we are and what we 
stand for not compared to others of our party but compared to 
each other 
bob dole jack kemp pete du pont al haig theyre all 
good men and tough competitors bush said i never liked the 
strain of finding differences with my fellow republicans 
before bush spoke he was praised by dole kemp du pont and 
haig and television evangelist pat robertson sent a letter saying 
he couldnt make the event because of a scheduling conflict but 
that bush had earned and deserves the support of conservatives 
youve got to have experience and george bush has it all over 
michael dukakis day after day after day dole said 
kemp said bush is our nominee and very frankly i look 
forward to working with bob and al and pete and pat to make sure we 
have a republican in 1988 
bush said his new campaign strategy beginning with a thursday 
speech in which he cited many differences with dukakis on specific 
issues represented a turning point 
its my job now not just to say what im for but to give the 
american people the facts about governor dukakis he said bush 
said dukakis should understand that 
governor dukakis is a tough campaigner just ask onetime gop 
gubernatorial rival ed king and i expect the same from him he 
said i am not going to be deterred from telling the truth 
earlier bush had said he wasnt surprised that the dukakis camp 
protested his charge of thursday that the massachusetts governor 
is a liberal posing as a moderate 
but in a chat with reporters aboard air force two en route to 
denver for the unity gathering with some of his defeated republican 
opponents the certain gop nominee said democrats are trying to 
hide dukakis record 
at the same time bush a late 1940s yale graduate offered no 
apology for labeling dukakis a political figure born of harvard 
yards boutique saying it was meant as a statement about the 
governors supposed intellectual elitism rather than as a 
statement about class 
shortly after bush attacked dukakis on a broad range of foreign 
policy and domestic issues on thursday the governors press 
secretary issued a statement saying bush was panicked by his 
relatively low standing in the polls and was resorting to 
mudslinging and tearing down 
standing on a tarmac at denvers stapleton airport bush said 
friday he thought it curious that the dukakis campaign 
immediately sallied forth with the accusation of dirty politics 
youre looking at a guy whos been getting hit for six months 
guilt by association and all kinds of personal attacks the vice 
president said what happens now they raise the mudslinging 
thing he said this is going to be a fun campaign

vietnam said friday a good rice crop 
has eased critical food shortages in some areas but that the nation 
still needs assistance 
the communist government has appealed for international aid 
especially for the northern regions natural disasters ravaged last 
years winter and spring rice crops 
with the harvest having begun here and there the food 
situation in the fooddeficient provinces in the north has eased 
visibly but much remains to be done to bring about a durable and 
allaround solution the official vietnam news agency said 
the report said the recent harvest in the mekong river delta of 
the south vietnams main riceproducing area was estimated at 
240000 to 300000 tons more than last year 
farmers in the norths red river delta are preparing for the 
harvest which usually comes a month after the southern harvest 
vna said 
this years output is estimated at 61606600 pounds of rice 
per hectare up from 4840 pounds last year the ageny reported a 
hectare is 247 acres 
the agency added however that the increase is barely enough 
to make up for the heavy losses caused by natural calamities in 
last years crop 
twenty percent of vietnams people live in the red river delta 
but it accounts for only 5 percent of the cultivated area

gov roy romer on friday reluctantly recommended a 
permit for a dam that would guarantee a water supply for the 
growing metropolitan area at the cost of flooding a scenic canyon 
colorado should build two forks in my judgment only as a 
last resort the governor told a packed news conference at the 
state capitol the proposed two forks dam and reservoir southwest 
of denver would flood cheesman canyon which romer would like to 
see preserved as a state recreational area 
i am challenging the state to find an alternate solution 
said romer who attached attached several conditions to his 
recommendation and said he favored building a smaller dam and 
reservoir at estabrook 
romer said the two forks permit was an insurance policy for 
metropolitan denver to be used only if other water sources and 
conservation proved insufficient which he said is unlikely 
we do not need to sacrifice that canyon in order to have 
water the governor said 
the dam project was proposed by the denver water board and a 
consortium of 42 metropolitan area water providers and 
municipalities 
proponents have portrayed the project as crucial to metropolitan 
growth they project that the regions population will grow from 
its present 15 million to 25 million by 2035 outstripping its 
supply of water 
environmentalists and sportsmen say the project would needlessly 
wipe out 20 miles of trout fishing and recreation and would 
threaten whooping crane habitat and irrigators along the platte 
river in nebraska 
the us army corps of engineers must decide whether to issue a 
permit and is accustomed to considering a governors 
recommendation as an important factor 
at the corps of engineers district office in omaha col steven 
g west said romers statement was one of great importance in the 
corps decision which he expected in late summer or early fall 
the 615foothigh dam and 300footdeep reservoir would be built 
downstream from the confluence of the south platte river and its 
north fork about 25 miles southwest of denver 
if permits for the project were issued immediately it could be 
ready for use in 1995 providing 98000 acrefeet of water to the 
area officials have said one acrefoot is about 325000 gallons 
romer said he would recommend a 25year shelf life for the 
project meaning it could be built anytime during that period 
romer pegged his approval on several conditions including the 
creation of a metropolitanarea water conservation program and a 
metropolitan water authority to plan distribution of water supplies 
he also would require a plan to replace lost wildlife habitat 
and recreational facilities if two forks is built 
he also said he would seek a full study of his proposal to build 
a smaller dam and reservoir at estabrook about 20 miles west of 
two forks up the north fork 
handing the decision over the legislature to save the canyon 
is a copout said carse pustmueller platte river coordinator 
for the national audubon society 
were extremely pleased that the governor endorsed the 
issuance of permits and the 25year shelf life for two forks 
said ed pokorney of the denver water department 
nebraska gov kay orr said romer appeared to want to have it 
both ways 
gov romer i think has been acknowldedged as somebody who is 
a great compromiser she said but with his statement today 
id say he is a great fencestraddler

in rome foreign ministry officials said they assured nigeria 
the government will work in a spirit of maximum collaboration 
including determining responsibility in the case the italian 
news agency agi reported

private one and the case should not involve ties between the two 
countries agi said 
maman told reporters his government viewed with great concern 
the criminal act of shipping industrial waste into nigerian 
territory

drive to halt developed countries from disposing of nuclear and 
other toxic wastes in africa 
a report in caracas venezuela this week by the greenpeace 
environmental organization said increased waste shipments to africa 
mark a growing trend 
in particular africa the caribbean and latin america have 
become the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers from 
industrialized countries it said

fifty nations announced friday that 
they are nearing an accord on regulating worldwide movement of 
hazardous industrial wastes 
we have advanced rapidly with a willingness seldom seen in 
international conferences said alain clerc of switzerland the 
chairman of a conference sponsored by the united nations 
environment program 
we are now confident that a convention can be signed next 
year now we are about to set rules on this scandalous situation of 
waste exports going to developing countries unable to process 
these materials 
clerc heads a 50nation group of legal and technical experts 
formed to prepare a global agreement on the shipment of hazardous 
wastes 
a preliminary list that was drawn up includes 44 types of waste 
produced by most world industry especially those processing 
chemicals and minerals 
the meeting in caracas included western industrial countries and 
the soviet union the group was formed last year and is to hold 
another meeting later this year 
meeting delefates failed to agree on a demand by developing 
nations that transit countries be allowed to decide on waste 
shipments passing over their territory 
clerc said the conference agreed however that transit nations 
should be granted as much information as that provided to countries 
receiving the waste 
disagreement remained on how long a transit nation could hold up 
shipments over its territory 
greenpeace international one of the 14 organizations attending 
the meeting wanted more than emerged from the conference in a 
statement read at the end of the meeting representatives of the 
environmental organization called for a global ban on moving 
hazardous wastes across boundaries 
according to greenpeace the rate of such movements has 
accelerated in recent years it said the main route for shipping 
industrial wastes historically between industrialized europe and 
north america has exploded into lessindustrialized regions in 
particular africa the caribbean and latin america 
us delegate andrew senn representing the state department 
commented the greenpeace stand is fine if you disregard the 
economic element but there is one 
developed nations insisted at the meeting that processing waste 
could involve significant transfer of technologies that eventually 
would help ecnomically developing countries

about 140 children fled a baptist boarding 
home friday and scattered in a nearby town after allegations of 
child abuse at the home prompted a judge to put them temporarily in 
state custody authorities said 
prior to the time we arrived at the bethel campus the 
children had scattered state welfare commissioner thomas 
brittain said of the bethel home for children in the southeast 
misssissippi town of lucedale 
we were told they were allowed if not encouraged to leave 
the campus and some of the children said they were told to run 
he said 
the youngsters were found in private homes restaurants and 
walking the streets of lucedale said state police and george 
county sheriffs deputies 
by friday night about 60 children mostly teenagers had been 
bused to quarters at the mississippi state hospital at whitfield 
brittain said he said they were undergoing physical examinations 
brittain estimated 80 youths remained missing and that officers 
would be searching for them through the weekend 
it wasnt known exactly how many children had been at the home 
because its operator the rev herman fountain was released friday 
after two days in jail for refusing to give authorities with a list 
of the children in his care 
brittain said fountain was at the home when welfare department 
officials arrived we did not encounter any cooperation from him 
there in fact it was just the opposite brittain said he would 
not elaborate 
the welfare department workers arrived at the home minutes after 
youth court judge robert oswald of pascagoula ruled there was 
probable cause to suspect physical and mental child abuse at the 
independent baptist institution 
a hearing in the case is scheduled for 930 am monday in 
lucedale 
fountain and several other ministers who flocked from 
louisiana georgia and texas to support him claim such boarding 
homes are protected from any state regulation because of the 
constitutional separation of church and state 
oswald ruled that the children were being held in detention 
according to the state youth act detention facilities are required 
to notify the state of children placed in their custody 
fountain was freed friday without providing the information when 
he agreed there would be an orderly transfer of the children to 
state custody 
brittain said he wasnt sure what action may be taken against 
fountain 
the court order gives the state 48hour temporary custody of the 
children not including saturday and sunday 
brittain said welfare officials would attempt to locate and 
return the children to their parents within that time period but 
he expected it might take longer to find all of the children 
we have information that some folks are trying to help the 
kids escape out of state he said 
based on experience with the bethesda home for girls near 
hattiesburg where about 100 residents were taken into state 
custody in september 1986 brittain said the childrens parents may 
be scattered across the nation 
oswalds order friday followed a weeklong hearing on a request 
for such action by george county authorities the hearing also 
concerned the legal status of a child who ran away from the bethel 
home for children

at least one out of 10 hearts and livers 
removed from donors for transplanting never reaches a dying patient 
and is discarded the national network for organ sharing said 
friday 
well never have a perfect system but were sure working 
toward one said kelle straw a spokeswman for the united network 
for organ sharing 
organs often have gone unused because they could not be matched 
immediately with a patient and because of insufficient numbers of 
transplant surgeons and inadequate hospital space she said 
the unos study included all hearts and livers recovered from 
braindead patients from oct 1 when a national transplant 
registry became active through may 15 
during the 7month period 905 hearts and 831 livers were 
recovered and reported to the network ms straw said 
nearly 85 percent of the hearts or 769 and almost 90 percent 
of the livers or 744 were transplanted she said the rest were 
used for research or thrown away 
the study done by computer analysis of the registry was 
prompted by last weeks report by the university of rochester organ 
procurement program that up to half of all suitable livers and 
hearts donated to the new york program were going to waste 
the unused organs cited by the rochester group were not removed 
from the donors bodies the unos study cited organs that were 
removed in anticipation of transplant surgery the difference 
accounted for at least part of the large disparity in the 
percentage of donor organs used said officials at both groups 
unos meanwhile is tracking the number of all hearts and livers 
that were donated for transplantation but were never removed the 
data is expected in about a week said ms straw 
we had potential donors with the emphasis on potential that 
we couldnt realize because we couldnt find a recipient for the 
organ the university of rochesters dr john ricotta said friday 
ricotta told the american society of transplant surgeons on june 
3 in chicago that a leading obstacle to matching donor organs with 
recipients is outdated patient lists including insufficient 
information about patients blood type and body size 
some organs were turned away because transplant teams were too 
busy or too tired and hospital space was limited ricotta said 
some hospitals preferred waiting for a local donor while still 
others said they didnt think the organs suited their needs 
there are a lot of reasons why an organ might not be used 
ms straw explained were doing the best that we can here and 
were looking into different areas to make it fair and equitable 
and to improve transplantation 
procedures in compiling the patient waiting lists are evolving 
and ricotta said its too early to know whether the rochester 
center is making better use of the hearts and livers offered to it 
the virginiabased unos has a federal contract to run the 
national organ procurement and transplantation network which links 
by computer all transplant centers and organ procurement agencies 
unos maintains the national computer system however it is 
the responsiblity of the transplant center to see that data of its 
recipients is accurate and current said gene pierce the 
networks executive director

officials blamed leftist rebels for explosions 
friday night that caused temporary power blackouts across central 
peru including sections of lima 
there were conflicting reports about possible sites of the 
explosions 
police in ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima reported three 
explosions and said they were investigating 
radio programas a news station quoted officials of the state 
utility firm electro surmedio as saying rebels had sabotaged 
transmission equipment near huancayo 130 miles east of lima 
the station carrying reports from correspondents in several 
cities said the blackout began at 640 pm 740 pm edt in 
about half of lima and in a 600mile zone reaching from the coast 
into the central highlands 
it said power was restored in most areas within a half hour 
perus utility network has been a frequent rebel target causing 
widespread blackouts 
thursday night guerrillas fired three 60mm mortar rounds at 
the us ambassador alexander watsons residence but police said 
there were no injuries and there was only minor damage to the roof 
of the twostory building 
shortly before midnight thursday rebels threw explosives at four 
lima automobile firms according to police who reported no injuries 
officials blamed thursdays attacks on guerrillas of the 
procuban tupac amaru revolutionary movement 
peru has a shortage of autotruck replacement parts mainly 
because of a lack of foreign currency critics have accused the 
government of mismanangement and also claim distributors have been 
speculating in spare parts 
tupac amaru guerrillas have been active since 1984 but most of 
their attacks have been made against targets and during hours when 
few casualties would be inflicted 
the maoist shining path guerrilla movement emerged in 1980 and 
has waged a bloody campaign of bombings and assassinations to 
overthrow the government

the government approved a settlement friday 
under which the last two companies making a weedkiller that can 
cause birth defects must halt sales of the product except for use 
on certain crops in the northwest 
under the agreement approved by environmental protection agency 
administrator lee m thomas the two manufacturers must cease most 
sales and distribution of dinoseb but can sell existing stocks for 
limited purposes 
the herbicide may be used for the rest of 1988 on dry peas 
lentils chickpeas and green peas in the states of washington 
oregon and idaho it may be used in 1988 and 1989 on berries in 
washington and oregon 
dinoseb can cause birth defects and poses a hazard to mens 
ability to have children said epa spokesman al heier 
he said thomas decided to allow limited continued use of dinoseb 
into 1989 because there is no substitute herbicide to treat weeds 
affecting certain plants in the northwest which would have been 
rather devastated if the weedkiller had been banned 
heier said the exceptions were small and would result in 
relatively little further use of the chemical under tight 
restrictions designed to prevent people from being exposed to it 
the epa in october 1986 issued an emergency ban on use of the 
weedkiller but two companies cedar chemical corp and drexel 
chemical co both near memphis tenn went through hearings to 
challenge the ban the agreement approved friday was reached 
between epa lawyers and those last two manufacturers 
several environmental groups had opposed any further sales of 
the weedkiller and any provision allowing for the use of existing 
supplies 
heier estimated that it could cost the epa 40 million to 
purchase all chemical companies existing supplies of dinoseb and 
another 155 million to dispose of it federal law requires epa to 
buy up and dispose of pesticides and herbicides that it bans as an 
emergency

city officials and hispanic leaders on 
friday agreed to work together to ease tensions triggered by the 
fatal shooting of a hispanic man by an offduty police officer 
for the first time in three nights the streets of perth amboy 
were quiet on wednesday and thursday nights rockthrowing rioters 
broke windows looted and toppled a car in a display reminiscent of 
the 1960s 
some said the rioting was the work of opportunist troublemakers 
using the recent shooting as an excuse to wreak havoc in this 
normally quiet industrial community evenly divided between whites 
and hispanics 
the breakthrough in easing tensions came in a threehour meeting 
of hispanic community leaders with middlesex county prosecutor alan 
rockoff mayor george j otlowski and police officials 
after the meeting rockoff said that his office will investigate 
the shooting and present the case to a county grand jury 
i think the people are satisfied with the response of the 
authorities especially the prosecutors office said the rev 
richard todd of our lady of fatima roman catholic church 
the church held a funeral mass for the slain man thursday night 
that was attended by more than 1000 people 
the two sides also agreed to form a commission to investigate 
bias in the city and to form a community council to hear grievances 
against the police rockoff said 
otlowski decided friday against a curfew or closing bars and 
liquor stores saying that would only increase tensions he said 
hispanic leaders should work with members of their community to 
restore calm 
hispanic leaders responded by calling for the ouster of the 
police chief 
the violence was touched off when offduty narcotics officer 
allen c fuller shot and killed carmen coria and critically wounded 
corias brother matteo outside a bar early monday 
authorities are still investigating the case but fuller has 
said he fired at the men because he believed his life was 
threatened by carmen coria who he said approached him holding a 
bottle fuller was suspended with pay pending the outcome of the 
investigation 
rockoff said his office will present its findings to a grand 
jury 
on wednesday small bands of people leaving a city council 
meeting threw rocks through store windows and burned out trash cans 
the problems worsened thursday night when 1000 marchers at a 
funeral for coria confronted police who wore riot gear in 
anticipation of trouble small bands of people also dispersed 
through the business district smashing store windows with 
rockfilled plastic bags and toppling at least one car 
police arrested 20 people and some officers were hospitalized 
after being hit with rocks 
hispanic leaders called for a special prosecutor to investigate 
the shooting but otlowski said the county prosecutor could handle 
the case 
members of the hispanic community interviewed friday said 
corias shooting brought to a head tensions between the police 
department and hispanics 
this is just the result of years of abuse said sam cruz a 
member of the hispanic community ad hoc committee and one of 
thursday nights marchers we couldnt control them in the 
streets we dont want no violence 
eddie rodriguez a lawyer for the coria family called for 
police chief edward mullen to step aside blaming mullen for 
thursday nights clash 
we have communicated to the mayor the desire of the community 
to end all real or perceived police overaction or inaction in many 
instances where our people have been mistreated rodriguez said 
on a street corner near the riot scene a hispanic man 
identifying himself only as manny said police officers frequently 
abuse suspects by pushing them roughly using bad language and in 
some cases punching and kicking them 
they should have a little moderation they should have a 
little more justification when theyre throwing a guy around 
thats all be a little more moderate said manny 
the mayor declined to comment further on fuller but said the 
109member police force had at least 12 allegations of brutality in 
recent years and three or four officers had been fired or 
resigned because of such allegations 
otlowski and police officers who spoke on condition they not be 
identified said most of the rioters were people commonly in trouble 
with the law taking their frustrations out against the city for 
reasons that have nothing to do with racial tension 
some of these guys last night i see every day said one 
officer who asked his name not be used some of them dont even 
live here 
in august 1966 an antiloitering ordinance appeared to set off 
four nights of violence after a hispanic man was arrested 
hispanics said the ordinance violated their custom of visiting with 
friends on the street they also complained then of rough treatment 
by police and of being ignored by the community

sen alfonse damato says hes going to try to 
overcome the opposition of a house committee and win passage this 
year of legislation that would impose the death penalty on 
convicted drug dealers who kill 
the senate passed the electionyear bill friday voting 6529 
for the measure and ignoring critics pleas that the measure would 
be immoral ineffective and do little but pander to the publics 
frustration with illegal drugs 
its societys way of saying weve had enough said damato 
rny who sponsored the legislation 
the liberal leaders of the house judiciary committee which will 
consider the legislation have a history of quashing death penalty 
bills 
but bills can be pried out of committees if a majority of house 
members sign a petition requesting that the measure be brought to 
the floor damato conceded that because of the opposition of 
judiciary committee leaders the seldomused discharge petition 
procedure would probably be necessary 
he said if that did not work he would attach the provision to 
other drug legislation to be considered later this year if the 
legislation fails to receive house approval by the time the new 
congress begins in january lawmakers would have to begin the 
process anew 
there was no need for prodding in the senate where a majority 
of lawmakers from both parties 27 democrats and 38 republicans 
supported the legislation damato acknowledged to reporters later 
that the fact this is an election year may be some kind of an 
influence and im not going to guess how much 
opponents tried unsuccessfully to weaken the bill with several 
amendments one would have substituted life imprisonment for the 
measures death penalty another would have limited its 
applicability to drug dealers who kill law enforcement officers 
yet another sponsored by sen mark hatfield rore would have 
mandated that executions occur in public and be televised 
its a repulsive amendment to a repulsive proposal 
hatfield who opposed the legislation said of his amendment 
shortly before it was rejected on a voice vote 
the legislation allows the death penalty to be imposed on people 
who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and are 
then separately found guilty of killing law enforcement officers or 
private citizens in addition any person who commits a felony 
violation of federal drug laws who then kills an officer could face 
capital punishment 
morton h halperin director of the american civil liberties 
unions washington office called the bill an election year 
campaign platform and not a piece of serious legislation 
damato told reporters he believed the legislation would apply 
to hundreds and hundreds of potential cases 
the senators office citing fbi statistics said 57 law 
enforcement officers were killed between 1977 and 1986 pursuing 
suspects involved in drug cases twentythree of those officers 
died in 1986 alone 
three years ago federal legislation was enacted establishing 
the death penalty for military personnel convicted of espionage 
during peacetime under federal law the death penalty can also be 
imposed for airplane hijacking no one has yet been executed under 
the laws 
thirtyseven states have death penalty laws since 1976 when 
the supreme court resumed permitting executions after a fouryear 
lull 99 people all convicted murderers have been put to death 
in the united states 
the senate passed legislation in 1984 establishing the death 
penalty for attempts to kill the president and for murders 
committed on federal property but the house never approved the 
bill

official a representative of president andrew johnson and an army 
general beside crow creek in wyoming territory 
colorado springs was founded in 1871 by gen william jackson 
palmer the first of a long line of real estate speculators who 
built their fortunes off the towns newcomers 
always the land has drawn the people fanning out from 
challenger point are reminders of civilizations march through the 
ages as well as harbingers of things yet to come 
east of i25 buried under empty grasslands are a few precious 
flint tools left behind by folsom man in the last ice age 
in the west the abandoned ruins of vanished anasazi people 
erode with the seasons 
deep inside cheyenne mountain to the northeast hundreds of 
disciplined warriors scan tv screens for hints of impending 
annihilation 
to the southwest alone in the silent desert enormous antennas 
listen for alien voices from space 
since migrating man discovered the easiest path alongside the 
mountains the i25 corridor has attracted adventurers searching 
for wealth power security and a better life 
most of this technology has come to new mexico because of 
those wide open spots along the road said jim mitchell of sandia 
labs its not bunched up like boston its the same reason 
goddard came to roswell to start rocket tests its the same reason 
oppenheimer came there are not a lot of people around 
but like small voices in a wilderness some residents wonder if 
the buildup will be longterm economic panacea or fleeting bonanza 
some people who live beside i25 especially near any military 
installation euphemistically described as a class a resource 
meaning an enemys nuclear target adamantly oppose the military 
might around them 
i think the military buildup people and the pacifists share 
one same view that the world is becoming a very dangerous 
place said sydney spiegel a cheyenne wyo high school teacher 
and mx opponent where we part company is on how were going to 
make it safer they say more we say less 
these voices however are few compared to the thousands who 
work at plants and offices along i25 in three states some are 
transplanted californians from an overcrowded silicon valley and a 
polluted gridlocked los angeles others are bailing out of the 
highpriced overbuilt new englandtovirginia chute 
i was tired of terminal sophistication said h pike oliver 
executive vice president of aries properties who moved to colorado 
springs from southern california two years ago 
here im bettering my familys quality of life and it only 
takes me 15 minutes to get to an office where i can create a 
development from a 33squaremile blank sheet of paper said 
oliver whose company plans a residentialoffice complex on 24485 
acres just east of the city 
this place is on the verge of taking off i saw it happen in 
tucson orlando austin and raleighdurham im ready for it 
for dreamers theres still land left beside the nuclear highway

guided by the longest list of computer 
instructions ever written it would destroy soviet missiles with 
laser beams and projectiles as small as a coffee can 
but five years after president reagan called for the strategic 
defense initiative popularly called star wars some scientists 
still challenge it as a fantastical system unlikely to do the job 
the problems are more complex than those conquered in putting an 
astronaut on the moon they say because sdi must deal with future 
strategies of an opponent determined to foil it 
as a result its difficult to say if we can build a system 
that will work well against the offense which might exist 10 or 15 
years from now said kumar patel of atampt bell laboratories 
other experts inside and outside the pentagon express confidence 
the problems can be overcome providing a system effective enough 
to discourage the soviets from attacking 
dozens of sdi projects are on drawing boards and in test 
laboratories up and down a single stretch of interstate that links 
new mexico colorado and wyoming the scientists and military 
experts working on star wars along i25 americas nuclear highway 
are enthusiastic they say this is their generations manhattan 
project this generations chance to make a startling change in 
the nations defense 
the bestknown candidates for sdi weapons are directed 
energy devices such as the laser which would burn a footwide 
hole in a missile in less than few seconds 
but current devices would need so much more development to 
become sdi weapons that it might take eight years or more before 
scientists know if they would be feasible said harvard physicist 
nicolaas bloembergen cochairman of a recent study of such weapons 
for the american physical society 
the weapons would have to be much more powerful than current 
versions he said and in building them bigger new fundamental 
problems can crop up he said 
one problem involves the fact that fluctuations in the 
atmosphere can throw a laser beam out of focus researchers can 
overcome that with lowpower beams bloembergen said but nobody 
has shown such an ability with beams as strong as sdi would need 
fundamentally we dont know how to take care of large 
distortions and it is difficult to predict when that problem may 
be solved said atampts patel who cochaired the physical society 
study with bloembergen 
but gregory canavan assistant physics division leader at los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico believes it will take 
only a few years to show lasers can work as part of the sdi system 
i cant tell you feasibility is established what i can tell 
you is there dont appear to be any established barriers to 
demonstrating feasibility canavan said 
sdi lasers would be teamed with kinetic energy weapons which 
would fire projectiles to create highspeed collisions 
kinetic weapons are feasible in principle but what you dont 
know is whether you can build them small enough to launch and 
cheap enough and whether it will work well enough to make it an 
interesting system said john pike associate director for space 
policy of the federation of american scientists 
projectiles launched from space would need to be about the size 
of a coffee can while those shot from earth would be as big as a 
6foot human but the projectiles tested so far have been about as 
big as a volkswagen pike said 
they also cost far more than is feasible and dont have the 
maneuverability needed for an effective weapon he said 
col raymond ross director of the kinetic energy office at the 
pentagons strategic defense initiative organization said current 
projectiles are only for demonstrating the technology smaller ones 
will be available for actual weapons design he said 
smaller projectiles save money by using smaller rockets to 
launch them he said nobody knows what the cost of the actual 
weapons would be because the figure depends on results of current 
testing he said 
as for manueverability against soviet missiles we are 
proceeding on the correct path to accomplish that ross said 
sdi would also include software and instructions to tell 
computers how to spot and track targets coordinate the firing of 
weapons and do other tasks 
large software packages must be tested to see how well they 
work the fundamental problem with the sdi is you cant really do 
that kind of fullscale operational testing without having a 
nuclear war said software researcher david redell of digital 
equipment corp 
capt john donegan program manager for the planned first phase 
of sdi replied that military systems are now tested with a 
combination of physical and computergenerated targets a similar 
approach could effectively test early sdi software and probably the 
versions to follow he said

with an office here and one in denver 
tony montoyas small hightech firm designs electronic circuit 
boards and provides scientific expertise for local customers 
business is booming you might say because along americas 
nuclear highway interstate 25 the local customers are not your 
average computer or stereo shops 
montoyas customers create nuclear weapons 
there have been some real odd shapes real compact montoya 
said with a chuckle we dont always know what they do with our 
boards but we have an idea 
the son of a new mexico rancher has seen his enterprise lampm 
technologies triple its number of employees in three years and 
sales have risen fourfold to 36 million in 1987 
lampm which also designs components for satellites and the space 
shuttle is just one small part of the economic boom along i25 
which links wide open rangeland around from las cruces nm to 
the bighorn mountains near buffalo wyo 
this decade between the reagan administrations military 
buildup and the promise of star wars known formally as the 
strategic defense initiative billions of dollars have poured into 
the corridor that connects albuquerque and denver creating rapid 
growth and some economic shelter from hard times in oil and farming 
our work is speckled all the way through all the way up and 
down i25 montoya said id rather be here than anywhere 
else 
last year about 30 of every 1000 the united states spent on 
defense and energy was spent along i25 more than 84 billion in 
all per capita military spending in new mexico is twice the 
national average and colorados per capita figure is onethird 
higher wyoming its role in i25s military might largely confined 
to the care and keeping of 200 missiles receives less 
in new mexico the largest employers are los alamos national 
laboratory sandia national laboratories and kirtland air force 
base all involved in nuclear weapons and star wars 
as military appropriations rise and fall in washington so too 
does the economy of this state 
the federal government is the major industry in new mexico it 
accounts for 15 percent of all jobs in the state said brian 
mcdonald director of the bureau of business and economic research 
at the university of new mexico 
since 1976 weve had explosive growth mcdonald said 
federal spending in the state adjusted for inflation has 
increased 50 percent he said 
spending has grown steadily over the decade officials said 
because much of the sdi groundwork was done here even before 
there was an sdi 
the money tap didnt get turned on when the president 
introduced star wars in 1983 there was 1 billion being spent 
already on research said sidney singer associate director for 
defense research and applications at los alamos 
and entrepreneurs like montoya who did electronics work at 
white sands missile range near las cruces nm before striking 
out on his own eagerly took advantage of all the governmentfunded 
research and development 
sandia national labs where scientists design the devices to arm 
nuclear bombs and conduct research into a host of weapons and 
energy projects spent 575 million in the commercial community 
in the last fiscal year according to jon bedingfield director of 
procurement 
some 280 million of that came to the albuquerque area a 
portion to montoyas company 
to help spread the greenbacks in the state new mexico 
established research groups to aid technology transfer from 
government to private business and set up a computer network that 
links research projects all over the state 
the idea was using the national labs for economic 
development said martha buddecke one of the founders of 
technet which enables a researcher at las cruces to use 
supercomputers at los alamos hundreds of miles away 
the spending spigot has not enriched every town and business 
along i25 
some cuts have been made in star wars programs resulting in 
more modest timetables even layoffs other weapons research of 
course continues regardless of decisions on sdi merely the latest 
project to capture the research spotlight 
but government largesse on sdi and other defense projects helps 
soften the blow to economies such as colorados where the plunge 
in petroleum and farm prices has been sorely felt 
our economy is still somewhat flat but we feel weve bottomed 
out on the nogrowth of the past few years said curt wiedeman 
assistant director of state planning and budgeting 
unlike new mexico where federal megalabs drive the economic 
engine colorado relies heavily on civilian manufacturing and 
business as well as mining and oil 
but military installations in denver and colorado springs as 
well as a growing hightech alley paralleling i25 along the front 
range play an increasingly important role in the states overall 
economy 
just as oil and farm prices began to drop sdi spending kicked 
in keeping the state economy healthier than it might have been

a recent census bureau analysis shows federal spending in 
colorado has grown 64 percent since president reagan took office 
most of that increase has been military in colorado it jumped 
from about 2 billion in 1981 to 43 billion last year 
colorado springs a prime beneficiary is one of the fastest 
growing metropolitan areas in the country due to a halfdozen 
military installations and more than 100 aerospace computer and 
scientific research firms the city has increased its population to 
more than 350000 people from 236000 in 1970 and has been adding 
about 6000 jobs a year 
when we saw we were running out of telephone numbers in the 
303 code area we decided to put the new area code 719 in 
southern colorado said abel chavez of mountain bell 
telephonewe see a lot of things happening there 
the military is building a 100 million sdi complex in colorado 
springs that will eventually house 1 billion worth of computer 
wizardry to test star wars the national test facility at falcon 
air force station also home to the consolidated space operations 
center is expected to employ up to 2000 people by the end of 1992 
in all more than 2 billion in sdi contracts have been 
earmarked for i25s three states estimates the federation of 
american scientists based in washington dc 
the federation gathering information from a variety of sources 
including the strategic defense initiative office and department of 
defense publications has compiled a computerized data bank on sdi 
contracts it says its figures are current to march 1 
by far the regions biggest recipient of star wars dollars is 
new mexico said federation spokesman david bourns the federation 
estimates contracts worth 159 billion have been awarded within 
the state since sdi research and development began with 773 
million already spent 
in colorado the federation said contracts totaling 751 million 
have been assigned with 1918 million of that spent 
wyomings sdi work by comparison is miniscule just 1 million 
in contracts have been assigned there with 34500 spent so far on 
research at the university of wyoming in laramie 
in terms of military dollars coming into wyoming which has been 
seriously crippled by energy and agriculture slumps and a steady 
loss of population fe warren air force base accounts for less 
than 24 percent of state revenue 
the anticipated installation of 100 mx missiles around cheyenne 
along with resultant increases in personnel construction and 
services was expected to produce a windfall for the region when 
reagans request was cut in half and just 50 mxs were scheduled 
the fouryear project produced only 138 million in tax benefits 
in addition a lot of dollars that come into that base are 
never making it off base said dick ogara director of the 
center for economic and business data in cheyenne it has its 
own medical facilities food housing and recreation facilities 
for new mexico the driving force in its economy was created 
quite by accident the laboratory at los alamos was established by 
j robert oppenheimer father of the atomic bomb as his base for 
the manhattan project 
it was an area oppenheimer knew from summer vacations to the 
mountains near santa fe and when he needed a secluded spot for 
secret research oppenheimer came to new mexico the lab at los 
alamos grew and now has nearly 9000 employees the largest single 
payroll in the state 
about 160 miles away the spot where the atomic bomb was tested 
became white sands missile range where most conventional weapons 
missiles and sdi gizmos come to be tried out white sands has more 
than 6000 employees and like the other labs has star wars 
construction under way 
sandia labs found a home near los alamos and the air force base 
used to service the area 
albuquerque near both los alamos and sandia was chosen for the 
air force weapons lab which has a 342 million annual budget 60 
percent of it for star wars 1000 employees and a mission to 
explore any kind of energy source that would ruin the other guys 
day according to spokesman rich garcia 
and the pattern continues today six years ago when the air 
force established a space technology center it chose albuquerque 
add 197 million each year 
this is where sandia and los alamos were and they do the 
nuclear work so it made sense for us to be located with them 
said garcia 
montoya would say much the same 
everything starts from that the first atomic bomb the 
hightech movement here started way back in those early times and 
the department of defense and the department of energy grew into 
this area he said 
about 90 percent of lampms business is tied to defense department 
money 
were bursting at the seams and were attempting to expand 
he said 
those in business here could see sdi on the horizon and gear up 
for the boom he said certain tests were accomplished in the 
late 60s that i was involved in like the first airborne laser 
tests i could see it coming

different from traditional laser beams a neutral particle beam 
has one big advantage for sdi use scientists say it can penetrate 
objects and discriminate between real missiles and decoys 
theoretically it can also destroy objects as fast as 10 per 
second in space 
the initial concept actually came from the soviets in the 1970s 
it was picked up at los alamos national laboratory and carried much 
further 
we dont think the opposition has anything like this said 
stan schriber project director this technology wasnt 
understood theoretically until two years ago it had been a mystery 
in the scientific community for 10 years 
in a neutral particle beam a stream of charged hydrogen 
particles receives an added electron then is accelerated to great 
speeds before release the extra electron is stripped out 
creating a neutral beam one unaffected by magnetic fields 
a ground test facility for an npb is under construction outside 
schribers office it will be a prototype for a weapons system 
if the funding stays this could be deployed by the year 
2000 he said

bear a small neutral particle beam machine on a rocket will be 
here next year 
already under contruction at los alamos the 44inchdiameter 
machine will be loaded onto an aries rocket launched from the 
white sands missile range on a suborbital flight and fired 
the primary goal is to take one of these complicated things 
into space its never been done before said kenneth mckenna 
deputy project manager we have to know we can operate in space 
the sdi command has accelerated bears timetable so decisions 
can be made on the most promising technologies mckenna said his 
team is already working nights and weekends 
while schriber works to make a bigger npb machine to prove it 
can be made powerful enough to destroy missiles mckenna tries to 
make it smaller to prove it can work in space the technologies 
would later be merged 
i am very confident it will work when we get it up there he

at the air force weapons lab researchers have combined laser 
beams in a phased array and instead of getting the sum of the 
power of the individual lasers they get much more 
what they envision is a set of seven lasers in space that when 
combined give the power of 49 lasers 
we can make a small laser act as a big one and shoot down 
missiles said air force lt dave russell electrooptics 
engineer you cant manufacture something great big and put it in 
space but you can put up a whole bunch of little ones 
in just four years of sdi work the air force has combined three 
lasers produced the power of nine and moved the beam from target 
to target 
weve got the basic idea in hand russell said its just 
a matter of time before someone makes a decision to deploy or not

pbfa ii is a merrygoroundlike contraption 108 feet wide with 
36 arms arranged around a circular center the sandia national 
laboratories machine is designed to fire an ion beam at a target 
pellet and ignite a nuclear fusion but it has yet to be done 
by creating small nuclear explosions in the laboratory 
scientists say theyll be on the road to making fusion energy 
available for commercial use and being able to test nuclear weapons 
and materials in the laboratory instead of with underground 
explosions 
fusion combining two atoms is the power of nuclear warheads 
fission splitting an atom is the power of old atomic weapons and 
of todays nuclear power plants fusion if ever harnessed in the 
laboratory could yield almost limitless energy without as much 
hazardous waste 
at pbfa ii controllers sit in a small room fashioned after a 
ships bridge with operators at screens labeled commander 
spock capt james kirk and lt sulu 
we get closer to fusion every day said senior technical 
aide guy donovan 
at full power pbfa iis output would be 50 times the worlds 
existing electrical generating capacity for the extremely short

eighty acres of new mexico desert have been cleared of sage and 
brush for construction of a free electron laser a machine capable 
of firing a beam at the speed of light into space once up there 
the beam would be bounced off orbiting mirrors to intercept soviet 
missiles within minutes of launch 
the technology is available today the problem is getting it 
to this level and this size said air force lt col lloyd young 
the assistant project manager 
by 1995 the military hopes to conduct an experiment in space 
with the gbfel but this years funds were cut and work has been 
delayed 
two kinds of free electron lasers are competing one at los

when the red scare the cold war and the 
arms race were on in the 1950s residents here enthusiastically 
embraced the idea of a defense program coming to a rocky expanse 
east of the flatiron mountains 
it was there between golden and boulder that the government 
built a nuclear weapons plant and residents saw security and 
opportunity in the news not danger 
its a different story now 
the rocky flats plant which makes weapons components from 
plutonium has become the target of safety and environmental 
concerns over the years there have been fires lawsuit settlements 
and studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium contamination 
suburbs have stretched out toward plant gates over the years 
bringing the population closer to potential danger 
and even though the plant has grown to a 500 millionayear 
operation affecting 20000 jobs some residents wish the facility 
once so warmly welcomed would just go away 
the people who live near and who work inside these facilities 
have the right to be free of fear said us rep david skaggs a 
democrat whose district includes rocky flats 
rocky flats is an example of the dilemma faced along americas 
nuclear highway interstate 25 with the work on nuclear weapons 
and even star wars research come not only jobs and growth but 
also danger and health hazards 
the plant spawned its own boom a planned community broomfield 
sprouted in nearby fields superhighways like i25 and us 36 
the denverboulder turnpike were under construction nearby and 
the plants responsibilities grew along with the nations nuclear 
arsenal 
even accidents like a 1957 fire that blew through more than 600 
air purifying filters to release a plutoniumlaced cloud of smoke 
did not cause much concern only worry that the plants work might 
be interrupted 
a 1969 fire did millions of dollars in damage but again the 
reports stressed the potential production delay a fireman exposed 
to plutonium was interviewed several days after the blaze and was 
reported doing fine 
but concern about plant safety did grow and plant officials 
began regular briefings with municipal and government officials 
they also upgraded the plant to keep plutonium which ignites when 
exposed to air in an inert atmosphere to prevent fire 
a series of studies by carl johnson then director of the 
jefferson county health department showed plutonium contamination 
on land and water downwind from rocky flats a higher incidence of 
cancer than average in the region and serious problems with 
contaminated land and water from the residue of the plutonium 
processing at rocky flats 
the operation originally under dow chemical but now run by 
rockwell international under contract to the department of energy 
rebutted johnsons findings but people began to worry about their 
neighbor 
as the 1980s arrived with homes built close enough for 
homeowners to stand in their backyards and see the rows of 
prisontype yardlights illuminating rocky flats at night the 
demand for scrutiny and oversight of the plant grew to a clamor 
in a precedentsetting decision in 1986 rockwell and doe agreed 
that the colorado department of health could review and regulate 
hazardous wastes at the plant 
at the same time workrelated lawsuits by former employees 
began cropping up in court two employees won settlements after 
claiming that prolonged exposure to radioactive materials had 
caused their cancer 
a lawsuit over traces of radioactive materials in neighboring 
fields triggered a decadelong battle that ended with a 10 million 
settlement 
skaggs and us rep patricia schroeder a denver democrat have 
suggested creation of an independent panel to regulate 
environmental health and safety concerns 
doe wants to say these are the levels of emissions that are 
safe and we dont have those levels therefore we are safe 
schroeder said thats the crux of the whole debate ive never 
gotten what i would call independent data 
rocky flats management cays its working toward that goal 
were happy about it more attention said rockwell 
spokesman pat etchard we cant release everything for obvious 
reasons but putting things up for public debate usually clears 
things up and gets issues out front 
meanwhile communities near rocky flats are trying to grapple 
with the dilemma of depending on jobs while fearing the hazards 
arvadas compromise was to call for a shutdown of plutonium 
operations but to add workers for cleanup duties broomfield 
officials endorsed the plants safety efforts after meeting with 
plant officials 
because of the long time span estimated needed for a move 20 
years local governments are concerned but not worried about the 
potential loss of jobs the required cleanup operations at the site 
if it were closed would keep workers busy for many years 
but the price tag of a move put at around 4 billion by 
rockwell is a major obstacle 
sen tim wirth dcolo has suggested delaying 380 million in 
scheduled improvements at rocky flats until its future is pinned 
down 
we should not be embarking on an expensive program without 
having a thorough plan for the future of the nuclear weapons 
complex he said

one command tracks everything in space under the other its his 
job to inform the president if the united states comes under enemy

last year there were just under 700 space and missile launches 
of all types the soviet union conducted just under 600 of those 
he said the sensors detect a launch and our people go into 
action immediately to determine is it headed toward north 
america could it reach north america 
those that evidence a threat to north america must be 
evaluated by myself or my canadian deputy i would say that was 
well over 100 in 1987 
i get involved in taking into account everything thats going 
on in the intelligence situation is the soviet union or the 
united states in a confrontation somewhere in the world is there a 
crisis brewing is there any correlation with this potential threat 
that would indicate its real one takes the entire world

the area thats the hot thing going on here i deliver to nasa

working on star wars theyre different from the locals theyre 
engineers mostly and their favorite sandwich is turkey and 
avocado 
it turns out im the only thing in the phone book that says 
star wars so i get calls all the time from engineers asking for 
jobs i ask them if they can make sandwiches and they usually are 
a little taken aback 
this place follows the budget in washington thats what 
affects this area what weve got going for us is defense we dont

exit 222 retirees richard and mary carter of albuquerque 
nm live in the four hills section that abuts the manzano 
mountains dotted with concrete bunkers and huge doorways the 
mountains are said to hold the largest single stockpile of nuclear 
weapons in the country the air force will neither confirm nor deny 
the existence of such a cache but the carters and their neighbors 
assume the barbwire fences in their backyards mean only one thing 
sometimes at night a whole flood of lights will come on out 
there and you wonder whats going on mrs carter said we 
heard mention of the weapons when we bought this house maybe 
if we were younger we would have thought about it more before we 
bought but at our time in life its not a factor for us

if its there you have to believe its safe said carter 
an anesthesiologist from schenectady ny and its ok with me 
someday they might need it 
the good thing about it and this was a factor when we bought 
the house is that there is so much clear area behind the house 
and you know that nobody is going to build up against us you can 
be sure of that

believes the 
nuclear weapons plant threatens the health and welfare of 15 
million people 
i grew up in the 50s when we had air raid drills in the 
sixth grade we had to hide in the school basement or duck under our 
desks cover our heads and wait for the bomb those drills had an 
enormous impact on this generation but nobody talks about it wed 
probably all go crazy if we really thought about the nuclear age 
 
my grandparents lived in southwestern utah one night in 1955 
i was visiting when the sky lit up and my bed shook we all rushed 
outside the government was testing bombs in nevada later the 
sheep died 
i got an english degree from mount holyoke college became a 
quaker went to southeast asia on a tourist visa to find out about 
the vietnam war came home read a story about leukemia in children 
following atmospheric nuclear testing and decided to get involved 
 
im a lay person not a scientist but it helps to have been 
able to spend two full years on this politicians and agency 
officials give me appointments now intellectually its the most 
challenging work ive ever done

exit 278 los alamos national laboratory scientist larry 
warner 56 of los alamos nm manages a project to design a free 
electron laser that could destroy enemy missiles in space with a 
phd in nuclear physics he joined the project after two decades 
working on nuclear weapons here and at the pentagon 
theres no conflict going from weapons work to sdi work the 
fact that it may look like i switched sides is not important its 
the scientific challenge thats important 
often people around here do get into ethical discussions 
there are some people at the lab who do feel very strongly against 
nuclear weapons and they obviously dont work on weapons programs 
some people just come here for the science but a lot of people are 
here because they think they can help the defense of the nation 
i worked on nuclear weapons because i felt it was important to 
insure international stability the ethics is not nearly so 
tricky in sdi i think for the people involved in sdi this is a 
lot like the manhattan project sdi has some of that same spirit

when gb olivers father set out 
to buy land for a family ranch in the 1940s friends told him not 
to buy across the border because the mexican government could take 
it away at any time 
instead he bought 1280 acres in new mexico and the american 
government took half of it away 
its hard to believe what happened oliver said my dad 
said about the military that it was like watching a snake swallow a 
rabbit they wrapped around us until they got us in a position 
where we couldnt do anything then they slobbered all over us and 
then they finished us off 
the government took half of the olivers land on a 20year lease 
for part of the white sands missile range a vast army proving 
ground for everything from the worlds first atomic bomb to todays 
highspeed aircraft bombs missiles and even star wars lasers 
like other ranchers the olivers were paid only a portion of 
what the acreage was worth and like others they continue to 
fight only this year losing the latest round in court 
were fighting the battle now for the second generation 
oliver said and my feeling is that were fighting for the 
precedent of the thing thats whats dangerous that the 
government could put anybody out of business just like that 
about 120 ranching families have carried on the fight over the 
land seeking a total of 25 million50 million in compensation 
some lost entire ranches some like the olivers lost only a 
portion of the prairie to the missile range 
their trouble began in world war ii when the army decided it 
needed 2 million acres in southern new mexico for weapons testing 
the ranchers forced to vacate and sign 20year leases were 
told the land would be returned but by the time the leases 
expired the buildings at white sands were permanent even though 
the war was long over weapons testing continued 
the land was condemned 
over the years the ranchers have demonstrated appeared before 
congressional panels and pursued their lawsuits they acknowledge 
that the way the law is written the army can condemn the land and 
pay whatever it wants 
only two months ago the us claims court in washington 
concluded the ranchers do not have a legal or equitable claim 
agaist the united states and that any payment to them would be a 
gratuity 
the ranchers just dont think its fair 
they took our lives from us they just said get off and fend 
for yourself said rancher howard wood 
woods family had more than 50000 acres of land worth at 
minimum half a million dollars after the army took it his mother 
had to work as a waitress in tularosa nm to support the family 
at age 84 she now lives in a government housing project 
if they bought it outright as a ranch at an amount that a 
fellow could take and get another ranch that would have been ok 
wood said if they had gone ahead and taken the thing outright 
and never told us wed get it back that might have been better 
too 
but they let the thing linger on and we kept holding on 
hoping to go back and it turned out the contract we had was not 
worth the paper it was written on 
oliver blames the dispute for his fathers death of a stroke in 
1972 one day after a heated meeting with a us corps of engineers 
official 
like others the elder oliver spent 20 years with his life on 
hold awaiting the day he could get back the half of the ranch 
behind the wire fence and his son said he never gave up hope 
it killed dad oliver said he could not believe his 
government would do him like this

as lindi kirkbride kneeled in her garden to 
admire the first flowers of spring a black shadow passed overhead 
blotting out the sun 
its them she said not even bothering to look up 
them was an air force helicopter that stuck out like a big 
bug against a sky as blue as a robins egg 
the chopper was patrolling a few of the 12600 square miles that 
the 90th missile wing of the us air force strategic air command 
oversees in southeastern wyoming northeastern colorado and 
southwestern nebraska 
but on that sunny day its flight over some of hardingkirkbride 
ranchs 66000 acres was a reminder that just beyond the gentle 
hills surrounding lindis home the worlds deadliest weapons are 
poised beneath the prairie 
spiritually morally ethically im against the mx said 
mrs kirkbride 39 when i drive by those three mx sites on our 
land i force myself to think about them and i pray i pray that 
god has angels on them holding the missiles down 
each mx is fitted with 10 independently targetable nuclear 
warheads carrying the equivalent of 300 kilotons of tnt apiece 
more than 20 times the power of the bomb dropped on hiroshima by 
years end the air force plans to have completed deployment of 50 
mxs in silos buried 80 feet deep on the wyoming plateau 
in addition to the mxs the 90th missile wing headquartered at 
fe warren air force base in cheyenne 35 miles southwest of the 
kirkbride ranch maintains 150 minuteman iii intercontinental 
ballistic missiles scattered in the 12600squaremile corner where 
wyoming meets nebraska and colorado an area larger than belgium 
ever since americas first icbm the atlas was deployed in 
1959 lindi kirkbrides family and neighbors have lived with the 
bomb 
the city of cheyenne was so proud to be a part of the 
countrys new defense system that an addition was made to local 
road signs reading welcome to wyoming home of frontier days and 
the atlas missile according to peacekeepers of the plains 
the title of the missile wings official history and also its 
nickname 
no one opposed the icbms city fathers welcomed the revenue and 
jobs ranchers gladly sold land for missile sites and were happy to 
see new roads 
when the atlas was declared obsolete it was replaced with the 
minuteman series then came the mx 
we were so naive so silly recalled mrs kirkbride i 
didnt know diddlysquat about this issue i suspected i didnt 
want to know it was too complex i felt powerless 
a fledgling group calling itself wyoming against mx held its 
first meeting in january 1981 
i finally got off the fence mrs kirkbride said but even 
then i knew i didnt have to win anything i just had to do the 
right thing 
from that moment nothing was the same for the closeknit 
kirkbride clan founded in wyoming five generations ago by a scot 
who arrived with 5 and a rocking chair 
lindi a texan who met her husband alan at the university of 
wyoming where she majored in social work and he studied 
agriculture became a spokeswoman for wyoming against mx she 
testified at hearings and wrote letters to newspapers she went to 
the soviet union with a group called ranchers for peace this wife 
mother of three homemaker churchgoer guest on nightline 
came home from moscow a pariah 
nobody asked me a single question about my trip mrs 
kirkbride said quietly the local paper crucified me people 
called me a communist accused me of being like jane fonda 
party invitations from the conservative patriotic cheyenne 
establishment dried up her children told her mom youre weird 
sometimes relations became increasingly strained between mrs 
kirkbride and her husbands family 
i told my whole family if i cant get along with you i have 
no business going to the soviet union talking to the russians 
she said therefore i will continue to try to communicate with 
you even though sometimes it is hurtful and painful 
there were blowups 
we discuss all this in our family and we disagree shirley 
kirkbride lindis motherinlaw said tactfully but we all love 
each other we love lindi shes never been anything but 
gracious shes respectful and she studies a lot about it she 
doesnt just lash out emotionally this is her thing and i support 
her right to do it 
to the windowsill above her kitchen sink lindi kirkbride has 
taped a poem she reads daily 
my lord god i have no idea where i am going i do not see the 
road ahead of me i cannot know for certain where it will end nor 
do i really know myself and the fact that i think i am following 
your will does not mean that i am actually doing so 
the first mx was deployed in december 1986 
when i heard the news i felt like id been kicked in the 
teeth i wanted to throw up she recalled 
that christmas she placed a wreath at the missile site 4 miles 
west of her house and began fighting a new battle 
the pentagon wants to deploy rail garrison a mobile defense 
system that would in times of international crisis shuttle 50 mxs 
around the country aboard 25 trains to confuse the enemy the air 
force wants the system based at fe warren 
weve come a long way said an everoptimistic lindi 
kirkbride we may stop it this time 
meanwhile the helicopters fly overhead and armed guards in 
military vans patrol the ranchs gravel roads beneath the ground 
24 hours a day 365 days a year in bunkers built to withstand 
nuclear fallout young officers sit trained and ready awaiting 
orders to launch 
sometimes especially in the spring i look out over the 
valley at the new grass and the cattle and i try to visualize what 
the prairie was like before the missiles came thats what i wanted 
to pass on to my children said mrs kirkbride 
instead i see what we get when we dont trust one another 
when we hate we get an imperfect deadly world people say we 
cant go back we have to accept this monster this mutant 
my vision is to say no we dont

ted church knew something was up that 
december he was 17 and the year was 1942 the year when war came 
to the secluded mesa his family called home 
trenches were dug the army rolled in ted and his younger 
brothers needed passes to come and go 
it was war yes but never a shot was fired this was the 
manhattan project the effort that created the worlds first atomic 
bomb 
teds parents peggy pond church and ferm church ran the los 
alamos ranch school an elite private academy for boys it was 
their life and their livelihood and that december it was taken 
away by one mans vision 
the ranch school was condemned and the family evicted by the 
government which paid only 769 an acre a mesa created in a 
volcanic eruption became almost overnight the secret home of the 
manhattan project 
peggy pond church author and poet wrote about peace and the 
deathmaker created on her homestead until she died 20 months ago 
her three sons ted now 63 allen 59 hugh 56 are still 
bitter 
yet in a quirk of history and destiny all three sons grew up to 
work for the bombmakers on federal nuclear weapons programs here 
at sandia national laboratories less than 100 miles from the mesa 
they carry on the work of j robert oppenheimer even as they 
carry the anger of losing their land to oppenheimer who knew the 
serene beauty of the ranch school from summer trips 
life is one big conflict hugh church said there are 
certain feelings of distress at times with what would happen if all 
these devices here were ever used but striving to keep them from 
being used is a major effort here too 
today the 54000 acres of family land remain the home of the 
los alamos national laboratory the topsecret center responsible 
for nearly every nuclear warhead of the 1980s 
sandia is a cousin laboratory of sorts where work proceeds on 
arming and fusing the weapons as well as on their safety and 
reliability 
over long careers all three brothers have returned to new 
mexico and worked on nuclear projects government is the major 
employer along interstate 25 americas nuclear highway and 
warheads are its primary task 
i had a good offer so i came here and ive been here ever 
since said allen church who works in sandias arming and firing 
division 
but like the others allen never set out to work here he 
studied to be a veterinarian but struggled with organic chemistry 
he went to hollywood and worked on six movies but decided acting 
was too unstable he was drafted for the korean war and later 
studied electrical engineering at stanford university then he came 
back to the southwest to new mexico to sandia 
this is part of my spirit this part of the country he said 
ted wanted to go into stage lighting but first served in the 
navy he worked in electronics and communications then went to the 
massachusetts institute of technology he had offers from 
electrical engineering firms but he too wanted to get closer to 
home so it was sandia where he studies health and safety issues 
hugh studied physics and meteorology earning a masters degree 
at ucla he worked for the us weather bureau then returned to new 
mexico in 1957 working on atmospheric weapons effects such as 
blast fallout and more recently nuclear winter a possible 
consequence of nuclear war in which smoke from weapons blasts and 
fires would encircle the earth and block much of the suns light 
and heat 
over the years the brothers have wrestled with the ethics of 
nuclear weapons they passionately disagreed with their mother but 
they always made peace 
she was always upset that the three of us ended up together 
here ted said but she was quite tolerant of it she made her 
feelings known 
ten years ago ted became a quaker joining a faith with a basic 
tenant that war is wrong he believes the faith fits with the work 
he does 
as long as nuclear weapons exist they demand a response from 
me he said many engineers and scientists just say its up 
to the politicians but i feel engineers and scientists have a 
responsibility to help the public understand 
all three talk of the responsibility borne by those who work 
with mans most deadly creations 
people on the outside have terrific imaginations allen 
said people say what about all those crazy people who work 
with nuclear weapons i say were not crazy i find people here to 
be very sincere they take it with a great deal of responsibility 
id rather be a part of it than leave it to someone else 
the brothers say they were too young to fully understand what 
was happening when the family received the eviction letter dec 7 
1942 exactly one year after the pearl harbor attack 
we really knew nothing about what was going on but we knew it 
had something to do with the war effort and it was all 
frightening ted said my parents knew oppenheimer and i 
suspect my father knew exactly what was happening 
the family had been told they could move back when the war 
ended they left behind personal belongings in the rush to vacate 
and never recovered some indian blankets pottery and other 
treasures 
it still hurts 
were displaced persons we were not asked we were told 
ted said 
we were promised return of the land when the war was over and 
of course it wasnt hugh said 
ferm church tried to restart the ranch school at another site 
but failed he wound up building power lines all over new mexico 
but never taught again he died in 1975 
peggy pond church once said we played the game and hid the 
soreness in our hearts as best we could i try not to sit in 
judgment on the world but i dont go back to los alamos now 
because its so ugly i cant stand it

the nuclear deterrent that haunts the church 
family in new mexico and divides the kirkbride clan in wyoming is 
the main motivation for the crews who work deep underground in 
blastproof capsules safeguarding the health of deadly 
missiles ever alert for the command that might send the warheads 
on their way 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they call themselves 
missileers cold war warriors who sit 80 feet underground in atomic 
bombproof bunkers girded for world war iii 
our mission is peace through deterrence said lt michael 
luft 29 im a missileer because i know im contributing to my 
nations security 
the ties that bind are steadfast belief in the job and deep 
faith that if the president of the united states orders the launch 
of mx and minuteman iii missiles theyll do it 
long before a possible crew member gets to training that 
persons reliability has been judged said luft thats to 
insure that individuals with only the highest amount of integrity 
actually man the missiles 
the nations 50 mx missiles are deployed alongside interstate 
25 americas nuclear highway and buried under wyomings high 
plains the missiles are controlled by this air base in cheyenne 
the 4000 men and women assigned to the 90th strategic missile 
wing including 1200 crack security police maintain and guard the 
most powerful landbased icbms in americas arsenal they also 
oversee 150 minuteman iiis 
officers are paired off to staff 20 launch control sites around 
the clock each pair a captain and a lieutenant are responsible 
for 10 missiles called a flight 
the crews work 24hour shifts 80 feet underground in a capsule 
the size of a budget hotel room it is suspended on shock 
absorbers no one but the crew can open its blastproof doors 
theres a bed television set and toilet but the compartment is 
dominated by twin consoles a bank of lights and buttons monitors 
the missiles health every 40 seconds its the missileers job 
to interpret the computer diagnosis 
we are always busy monitoring the system said luft we 
dont just sit out there with our hands on the keys 
the keys the heart of the matter on each console 12 feet 
apart is a keyhole the keys that could initiate a launch are 
locked in a bright red box along with secret papers necessary to 
send the warheads on their way each officer has a confidential 
combination to the box it takes both to open it 
additionally crews must dial a 16digit code to enable the 
missiles for launch only the president or his successors have 
those numbers 
the order to fire would come in a spoken code from the strategic 
air command over two loudspeakers the missileers practice the 
drill constantly 
failsafe procedures abound only after the code is correctly 
dialed can the officers use their keys they must be inserted and 
turned simultaneously while another crew in a different capsule 
also turns its two keys at the exact moment the keyholes are 
springloaded requiring constant key pressure to make them work 
looking glass the airborne command post that routinely 
checks the missiles peacetime functions can override any launch 
command 
we like redundancy in our business said lt col gerald 
perryman 39 the missile wings assistant deputy commander for 
operations every day the seals which cover the keyholes are 
examined to ensure they havent been tampered with 
the missileers consider themselves an elite force currently all 
those assigned to warren afb are men although some female missile 
officers are based at minuteman iii installations elsewhere the 
air force recently changed its policy to permit coed launch 
control crews 
like luft and perryman capt steve wagner 30 trains to keep 
in rockhard shape with their short haircuts lean physiques and 
starched darkblue uniforms set off by white cravats the 
missileers cut dashing figures 
if an officer is not pilot or navigatorqualified or an 
engineer hes likely to be assigned to missile crew duty said 
perryman missile crewmen have a good track record for promotion 
in competition with air crew members 
in todays military where space and star wars are top 
priorities that means watch out top gun here comes top 
rocket 
by the time young officers are assigned to a launch control 
capsule they have been put through psychological tests to 
determine if they will obey orders to fire nuclear weapons 
potential missile officers watch graphic films detailing the 
aftermath of the bombing of hiroshima 
we also get lectures about the effects of nuclear war said 
wagner we have to sign a statement after we view the movies 
after we practice our first key turn we have to sign another 
statement of personal reliability 
asked if he thought the missileers would survive incoming 
warheads lt aaron wilkins said its hard to say what would 
happen in a degraded environment nobody wants that to happen 
in a worstcase scenario with world war iii in progress and all 
his missiles launched what would wilkins do next 
i dont know it hasnt happened i guess we would await 
further orders

the rock memorabilia display in new yorks hard 
rock cafe recently acquired a small rather beatup electric piano 
that bears the inscription trashed in the ussr 
the piano belonged to billy joel and his tantrum is one of the 
highlights of the 90minute documentary by martin bell a matter 
of trust billy joel in the ussr which can be seen wednesday 
on abc 
the film is in fact what prompted joels wellpublicized 
attack on the innocent instrument he explained later he thought 
the camera lights were intimidating the audience 
in order to pay for the tour joel commissioned two movies a 
concert film for hbo directed by wayne isham and the documentary 
by bell an englishman whose documentary on runaways 
streetwise was nominated for an oscar in 1985 
the heylooktheyrejustlikeus impact of bells film is 
perhaps faded somewhat in the wash of publicity from the moscow 
summit but it is still a lovely travelogue and an interesting 
backstage portrait of a rock tour theres also plenty of 
behindthescenes footage of joel his wife christie brinkley and 
their infant daughter alexa ray to satisfy the most avid fan 
its difficult making films about rock n roll in general 
bell said in a telephone interview because of films like spinal 
tap that form is so wellparodied but the thing that was 
interesting to me was the soviet union and also billys music 
surprisingly he said it was not that difficult to work in the 
soviet union except for the difficulty of changing travel plans 
since aeroflot is demandingly prompt and always fully booked 
the other problem is its difficult getting food after 10 
oclock at night so youre limited to vodka and caviar and 
sturgeon how difficult can it be 
the interesting thing to me bell said was that it wasnt 
at all what i expected it to be i mean i really did go with an 
idea of what the place would look like i thought it would be dull 
and gray and uninteresting it wasnt it was the opposite 
lively full of color and the people incredibly warm 
one of the most profound moments in the film comes when joel 
visits the grave of russian folk singer vladimir visotsky who died 
in 1980 people stand in line all day just to glimpse the grave 
thats popular joel says admiringly later he meets 
visotskys mother who is enormously impressed that an american 
rock star would visit her sons grave 
there is also some nice footage of joel and his backup singers 
trading riffs with a georgian mens singing group 
the pianohurling came on the second night of the tour during a 
song joel shouts quit lighting the audience when there is no 
response from the lighting people he throws the piano over then 
attacks a microphone stand breaking it in two 
thank goodness he did it because its very dramatic in the 
film said bell 
at another concert joel confounds his soviet fans by going out 
into the audience and lying down on top of them at first 
perplexed they eventually get into the spirit and pass him hand 
by hand over the tops of their heads back to the stage i cant 
believe i did that cries joel 
the thing i am pleased about most in the film is that in a 
sense youre just seeing the people said bell youre seeing 
people respond directly to that music and they look just like us 
i dont know why that should be such a surprise but in a sense we 
havent seen the soviets like that

amid all the hoopla over mick dundee john 
rambo willow ufgood and other heroes of the new film season the 
infamous jason might be overlooked 
not by paramount pictures 
friday the 13th is a gold mine that keeps on rolling 
along declares sidney ganis president of worldwide marketing 
for paramount the studio reports that the first six films in the 
series have grossed over 172 million not to mention the big 
videocassette sales cable tv syndication and a tv series 
in its first 18 days friday the 13th part vii the new 
blood sold almost 16 million worth of tickets in the united 
states and canada since the film cost 35 million about 118th 
the budget of rambo iii it should already be solidly in the 
black 
part vii profited by premiering on friday the 13th of may 
the series always does better business when released on that 
fateful day 
jason has become part of the vernacular ganis said why 
i think because he is genuinely frightening and teenagers 
genuinely love to be frightened my own daughter loved friday the 
13th iii now she has seen vii and then she goes to see the 
more arty the moderns a whole generation has grown up on jason 
and keeps going back 
jason began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980 in a 
lowbudget thriller created by producerdirector sean cunningham 
ironically cunningham devised the title when he was planning a 
childrens television show he figured it might work for the title 
of a feature film and he was right friday the 13th grossed an 
amazing 40 million 
cunningham who is now filming another horror film deep 
six signed over his rights to paramount and the series has had 
five other directors the formula remains the same as in the 
original which starred kevin bacon later of footloose fame 
harry crosby son of bing and betsy palmer as jasons mother 
the action lots of it always takes place at camp crystal 
lake jason returns from the dead wearing a hockey mask and 
wielding an ax to pay back a grudge many years ago when he was a 
camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors 
were making love in the bushes jasons vengeance is wreaked upon 
the human race in general with special emphasis on oversexed 
counselors 
john carl buechler a special effects expert who became a 
director troll cellar dweller directed friday the 
13th vii from a script by daryl haney buechler pronounced 
beekler says he saw possibilities of applying two new twists to 
the same saga 
one i thought it would be good to have a main character in 
the story someone the audience could cry and cheer for and follow 
her through the nightmare world he said she is the teenager 
lar park lincoln whose special powers release jason from his 
grave at the bottom of the lake telling the story from one 
persons viewpoint had only been done once before in part v 
two i added a substantial element of the supernatural before 
part vii jason was a mindless man who jumped out of closets and 
killed people since he was resurrected by electricity in part vi 
he was now practically speaking a ghost that made him a 
virtually unstoppable humanoid 
so i thought it would be fun to fill the last two reels with 
false endings i wanted the audience to say oh hes up now hes 
down hes dead no hes up again my aim was more fantasy than 
reality 
even with the innovations buechler was careful not to tamper 
too much with the friday the 13th formula 
i was hired to satisfy the producers if i was hired to do a 
james bond picture i would certainly follow the bond formula he 
said 
friday the 13th vii inevitably found disfavor with the 
ratings board of the motion picture association of america which 
immediately branded the film with an x for extreme gore this would 
have made the movie unsalable since a film rated x prevents anyone 
under age 17 from being admitted to the theater 
like jason though the filmmakers kept coming back again and 
again with new cuts 
they gave us an x six times until we finally got an r 
buechler said i understand robocop holds the record at eight 
stunt man kane hodder is the seventh portrayer of jason which 
might seem a thankless acting job since he doesnt speak and is 
hidden behind a mask hodder doesnt agree 
ive always wanted to play that character ever since the first 
film says hodder who has coordinated stunts for house 
ghost town and other thrillers ive always believed that he 
should be played by a stunt man 
i think jason is more of a challenge because he has no 
dialogue i tried to get across the feeling of menace just by using 
certain head movements and body movements 
if the friday the 13th films are stiumlating to teenagers 
they are an ordeal for reviewers whose vituperation has no 
apparent effect on the audience 
critics hate the movies buechler said but surprisingly 
weve had mixed reviews on vii the common pattern is for the 
reviewer to comment that jason is here to stay then to review the 
previous one in the series and conclude if you liked them youll 
like this one

even after the crash last fall stocks still 
rank as the standout investment of the 1980s 
but longerterm statistics cast doubts on some traditional 
assumptions about the results stocks are likely to achieve in 
comparison to bonds and other interestbearing investments 
those are the principal conclusions that emerge from an annual 
investment scorecard compiled by the wall street firm of salomon 
brothers inc 
in posting a 145 percent compound annual rate of return from 
1980 through june 1 of this year stocks outperformed 13 other 
types of assets analyst robert s salomon jr said 
bonds ranked second at 128 percent followed by treasury 
bills at 98 percent 
the alsorans were diamonds up 54 old masters paintings up 
49 housing up 48 coins up 39 chinese ceramics up 29 
foreign exchange up 24 us stamps up 20 gold down 25 
farmland down 33 oil down 34 and silver down 93 
for the same period the consumer price index rose at a compound 
annual rate of 46 percent 
as these figures show several kinds of collectibles and other 
tangible assets that are supposed to serve as inflation hedges have 
not lived up to that billing in recent years 
they did perform handsomely in the 1970s when the consumer 
price index soared at a compound annual rate of 78 percent but 
they have had trouble keeping up with the less rapid inflation of 
the 1980s 
with stocks bonds and treasury bills in the top three 
positions the 1980s have clearly established themselves as a 
decade for financial assets salomon observed 
we expect the good relative performance of financial assets to 
persist he added inflation is likely to remain moderate 
there will be some cyclical pickup in the months ahead but 
the rate of gain will not reach the levels experienced in the 
1970s 
while salomons latest data for the 1980s may contain no big 
surprises for active investors his figures for the past 20 years 
do show something unexpected 
since 1968 both treasury bills with a compound annual return 
of 85 percent and bonds with a compound annual return of 81 
percent beat out stocks which were up 68 percent a year 
as salomon notes this flies in the face of an old piece of 
accepted wisdom in the financial world over long periods of time 
stocks are supposed to compensate their owners for the risks 
involved by outperforming interestbearing investments 
it can be argued that the period in question is an anomoly 
because stocks in 1968 were at a very high level near the peak of 
a long bull market 
nevertheless salomon says the fact remains that stock and 
bond returns were very close in the 1970s and in the 1980s two 
distinctly different periods 
the high return posted by treasury bills over the past two 
decades seems especially remarkable when you consider that bills 
which have lives of one year or less are considered one of the 
lowestrisk investments anywhere in the world 
salomon said he believes this unusual phenomenon stemmed from 
the unprecedented expansion in debt that has taken place over the 
past 20 years 
when demand for credit is heavy lenders in this case owners 
of treasury bills and bonds can command a generous return

having a wellgroomed lawn can be a suburban 
status symbol but its a goal often achieved at high cost in time 
effort and money 
so why bother 
well a thick green lawn makes the home more appealing prevents 
soil erosion provides a cooling effect in hot weather and even 
reduces noise pollution 
getting those benefits means raising a crop of turf grass a 
basically simple plant that will thrive if properly mowed watered 
and fertilized 
but those endeavors must be done regularly erratic watering and 
mowing can harm the lawn according to grass experts 
the council of better business bureaus has compiled some 
research on lawn care both suggestions on doing it yourself and 
on what to look for in a professional 
tips on lawn care and lawn care services is available for 1 
plus a long selfaddressed stamped envelope write to the cbbb 
1515 wilson blvd arlington va 22209 
watering and mowing seemingly the simplest of tasks can have a 
great effect if not done properly the booklet warns 
once you start watering keep it on a regular schedule the 
council urges 
irregular watering can be harmful as it might train the roots 
to grow too close to the surface leaving them more vulnerable to 
the scorching sun the booklet states 
watering at night tends encourage insects and diseases which 
perfer a dark damp environment daytime watering is better 
turning to mowing the booklet notes that while the best height 
varies according to the type of grass cutting grass too short is 
extremely harmful and can encourage certain varieties of weeds 
often people cut grass short to avoid mowing it as often the 
booklet says but longer grass is better able to withstand the hot 
sun and trampling feet and also can choke out many weeds as they 
sprout 
keep the blade sharp on the lawn mover the booklet goes on 
grass sliced evenly suffers the least damage while chopping or 
shredding the tips of blades leaves them more prone to damage by 
the sun insects and disease 
grass should be cut in dry weather and in the early evening 
if it is too wet from rain dew or fog the grass has a tendency to 
clump and not cut evenly the clippings will also stick together 
suffocating sections of the lawn 
last grass suffers the least amount of damage when mowed 
during the cooler parts of the day the booklet reports 
soil conditioning and fertilization needs vary from area to 
area the booklet points out suggesting having the soil tested by 
local cooperative extension agents those offices can also offer 
advice on what type of pest control may be needed and how to do it 
safely 
for some people hiring a professional lawn care service proves 
to be the answer saving them time and work some customers have 
complained to local bbb offices about billing problems with these 
services however as well as companies that did work without 
permission and then charged for it 
when choosing the company ask about the qualifications of the 
workers particularly the professionals in charge make sure they 
have proper business licenses and any certificates needed to apply 
chemicals 
get estimates from several firms but remember cheapest isnt 
always best 
ask for references from other customers check with the local 
better business bureau and consumer affairs office for complaints 
from past customers and find out if the firm is a member of a 
professional lawn care association with a code of ethics 
ask for a written agreement from the firm you finally choose 
check to see if it renews automatically each year or if you have a 
choice if renewal is automatic make sure you know how to cancel 
it should that become necessary

last years economic summit in venice is one 
that ronald reagan probably would like to forget 
already hobbled by the irancontra affair at home the president 
suffered a string of disappointments as americas major allies 
turned a deaf ear to many of his initiatives 
the defeats were particularly galling because reagan had enjoyed 
a number of policy successes only the year before at the tokyo 
summit which he labeled the best economic gathering he had 
attended 
but in venice there were few expectations for major policy 
breakthroughs as the leaders of the united states japan west 
germany britain france italy and canada gathered in the ornate 
library of a 17th century monastery for their discussions 
the parley was labeled the lameduck summit even before it 
began because so many of the participants were in the final stages 
of their administrations 
prospects are similarly scaled down for reagans final economic 
summit june 1921 in toronto few new policy initiatives are 
expected as us allies prefer to wait and deal with reagans 
successor 
the president went to venice last year hoping to convince 
americas allies to take a hardline stand on guarding the persian 
gulf oil lanes 
instead the seven major industrial democracies issued a lukewarm 
declaration endorsing the principle of freedom of navigation in the 
persian gulf that fell considerably short of the administrations 
wishes for a stern warning to iran 
a year later the us navy is still in the persian gulf 
providing escorts for 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers recently the 
administration announced it was expanding american protection to 
cover neutral merchant ships who are attacked and who seek us 
help from navy warships 
the venice summit basically reiterated the call strong 
condemnation of state dealings with terrorists that was hammered 
out over two days in tokyo the year before the partners did add a 
new sanction however banning airline flights to countries that 
refuse to extradite hijackers 
the allies also gave cautious approval to the quickening pace of 
ussoviet arms negotiations an area where reagan will be able to 
report substantial progress 
during the moscow summit reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev exchanged ratification papers for the mediumrange 
missile ban treaty although the talks failed to produce any 
breakthrough on an accord to reduce longrange nuclear weapons by 
as much as 50 percent 
on economic issues the administration claimed significant 
progress was made in venice on international cooperation critics 
were less kind however labeling the final economic communique a 
dolittle document which failed to reassure financial markets 
that two years of sluggish world growth would not worsen into a 
global recession 
when stock markets from new york to tokyo crashed in october 
many economists believed their worst fears were coming true 
however subsequent events have proven the doomsayers wrong the 
seven nations head into the toronto summit enjoying some of the 
fastest growth rates in years 
trade imbalances long a source of friction are easing as well 
while the united states suffered a record merchandise trade deficit 
of 1703 billion last year the imbalance between us exports and 
imports has shrunk significantly in the first three months of this 
year as us manufacturers enjoyed record export sales 
the turnaround represents a belated victory for treasury 
secretary james a baker who in september 1985 reversed 
administration policy and came out with the plaza accord a joint 
effort with the other summit countries to hasten the dollars 
decline 
since that time the dollar has fallen by about 50 percent 
against the currencies of japan and west germany a fact that has 
contributed greatly to the increased competitiveness of american 
goods overseas 
last year the united states and its allies became worried that 
the dollar had fallen too far and could frighten away the foreign 
investors the united states needs to finance its budget deficits 
while their efforts to brake the greenbacks fall were largely 
unsuccessful in 1987 they have had far better luck this year 
helped out by coordinated waves of intervention the process by 
which governments enter the market to buy and sell currencies out 
of their own treasuries 
the united states in venice won a consensus that the 200 
billion being spent annually on farm subsidies were 
counterproductive but since that time us negotiators have had no 
success in getting agreement on just how to go about eliminating 
those subsidies 
reagan proposed in venice scrapping all farm subsidies within 10 
years but european officials have vigorously resisted this idea 
the issue will again be on the table in toronto but given the 
intransigence of the positions little headway is expected

some farmers hit hard by a soilparching 
drought in northwestern ohio have appealed to a higher source in an 
effort to get the soaking rain they will need for their crops this 
year 
its the worst drought i have ever seen in my life it is the 
worst drought the elderly people have seen in their lives the 
fields are drying up like its august marjorie reiter said last 
week 
mrs reiter who farms about 200 acres near the seneca county 
village of new riegel was one of 250 people who attended a special 
prayer vigil at st nicholas roman catholic church in frenchtown 
near new riegel 
about 750 people attended a prayforrain service held at ss 
peter and paul catholic church in the putnam county city of ottawa 
sister mary christine pratt director of rural life ministries 
for the roman catholic diocese of toledo said the services were 
not a superstition thing 
its a case of the community coming together to support each 
other no matter what happens this sense of community wellbeing 
will continue she said 
mrs reiter agreed but added that some farmers prayers were 
answered a couple weeks ago at least temporarily 
our prayer service was on wednesday night and on thursday 
morning we received threetenths of an inch of rain she said 
the people were just joyful we were just hugging each other and 
just so thankful 
but we know we need more rain 
mrs reiter said the st nicolas service was attended by 
catholics and people of other faiths 
the church was full for the people this is affecting many 
many people its very serious she said the farmers have been 
been very down its been very depressing 
this has been one of the driest springs on record in ohio 
agricultural and weather service officials said in some areas 
precipitation is 6 to 9 inches below normal for the year 
the dry spell has meant that young crops arent growing corn 
and soybean seeds arent germinating and herbicides which are 
activated by water are not killing weeds 
if we dont get rain soon we dont have much potential for a 
fall harvest said farmer dale hoepf of new riegel 
thats really going to hit us hard because there are too many 
dollars laying out there that are not going to work for us at all 
and its going to be lost he said referring to money spent for 
seed chemicals and fertilizer

for the second year in a row drought is 
stalking the blueribbon trout streams of montana and wildlife 
experts and fishermen hope last years recordlow flows will not be 
repeated 
a lot is going to depend on what kind of moisture we have for 
the remainder of the spring and summer said larry peterman 
research chief of the state department of fish wildlife and parks 
if we have average or a littleaboveaverage moisture we 
might be able to get by without too many problems he said on 
the other hand if it turns dry again and we go through what weve 
been going through then some of our problems would be more 
widespread 
most early summer riverflow in montana comes from melting snow 
in the rocky mountains but the spring snowpack averaged about 
7075 percent of normal said rich brasch of the state department 
of natural resources and conservation 
in addition with the warm weather were losing snowpack much 
quicker than anticipated and so were looking at a possible 
critical situation by midjune or late june said phil farnes 
the state snow survey supervisor for the us soil conservation 
service 
its going to take more than normal moisture into august he 
said if we get just the normal amounts were going to see some 
problem areas 
low water can pose serious threats to trout and other game fish 
jim vashro of the fish and wildlife department said fish are 
forced to move to the deeper holes in streams and rivers for 
protection 
the fish are concentrated more so the predation and food 
competition goes up he said theres a larger mortality rate 
and less oxygen as the water temperatures go up the oxygen needs 
of the fish go up and they become stressed their growth rate is 
slowed or they die 
part of the ruby river in southwestern montana dried up last 
year due to heavy irrigation usage and little return flow because 
of the dry ground and the low water table 
the result said jerry wells in fwps bozeman office was the 
death of several hundred fish and those were just the ones we 
found 
i think theres been some changes made and we have reason to 
believe that we can avoid the river going dry he said we had 
a lot of rain during the early part of the irrigation season which 
took a lot of the pressure off and the groundwater is better 
state officials cite other potential problems in the bitterroot 
river near the idaho border and the upper clark fork river a 
major tributary of the columbia river 
vashro said two major reservoirs in northwestern montana 
hungry horse and lake koocanusa already have been hurt by low 
water and that could mean fewer fish in the future 
lake koocanusa is a popular fishery for kokanee salmon and 
cutthroat rainbow and bull trout hungry horse next to glacier 
national park is known for its cutthroat and bull trout 
at its lowest point in late march vashro said lake koocanusa 
was only 40 percent of normal volume and hungry horse was at only 
13 percent of its normal volume when the water level hit its low in 
late april 
we need rain now and for the next year vashro said if we 
dont get a normal precipitation year we will be in even worse 
shape next year

third world debt trade and drug abuse will be on the agenda but 
little is expected in the way of new initiatives when president 
reagan meets next week in toronto with leaders of six major 
industrialized democracies 
here is a sampling of what each participant in the annual 
economic summit hopes to address at the meeting 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the toronto meeting will be president reagans eighth and final 
economic summit and adminstration officials are predicting that his 
policies will be centerpiece of the agenda 
but at the same officials predict no dramatic breakthroughs for 
his agricultural or trade initiatives with reagan leaving office 
next january many summit participants would prefer to wait until 
his successor is elected 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said us delegates 
expect considerable discussion of policies pushed by reagan and 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher designed to promote 
coordination among the powers in the pursuit of economic growth 
fitzwater said reagans proposal that agricultural subsidies be 
eliminated by the year 2000 is expected to be a major focus of 
the summit but it is an open question whether any commitment 
will be made 
it still is a controversial item among countries he said 
every country subsidizes its agriculture to a considerable 
degree every country has enormous political pressures at home to 
continue those subsidies and so how much progress can be made 
we just cant say in advance 
the spokesman said the free trade agreement negotiated last year 
by the united states and canada is expected to be a model for 
discussion of the free trade issue but he would not predict any 
breakthroughs 
they are going to have at least one session where they take a 
look at the progress of the last several years and from that try to 
project what some of the future problems may be said fitzwater

britain is seeking marked progress toward curbing trade 
protectionism and agricultural subsidies according to mrs 
thatchers aides the country which has few farmers and thus gains 
little from the subsidies has been a prime critic of the 12nation 
european economic communitys runaway farm budget 
we want to see a reduction in agricultural subsidies all 
round i think everyone has something to contribute said a 
thatcher aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there are signs of anglofrench rivalry in jockeying for 
initiatives on wiping out the poorest countries debts british 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson has welcomed a french 
proposal that the summit agree to wipe out a third of the debt but

french president francois mitterrand wants the summit 
participants to agree to wipe out one third of the debts owed them 
by the worlds poorest nations and said france will do this 
anyway 
it has never been so urgent and so necessary to act to help 
the countries of the third world while the gap between rich 
countries and poor countries continues to grow mitterrand wrote 
in a letter to the other heads of government 
he suggested the summit agree to consolidate existing debt at 
market interest rates but extend repayment periods from 20 to 25 
years he also listed as other options 
consolidating the debt at a special rate of no more than half 
the market rate but with repayments over about 15 years 
forgiving onethird of the total public or 
governmentguaranteed commercial debt with the rest consolidated 
at normal market terms 
with its menu of options it gives us reason to hope for a 
consensus mitterrands special counselor jacques attali said 
to qualify under the french proposal a nation must be extremely 
poor deeply in debt and in the process of improving the management 
of its economy 
the plan would not apply to the worlds most indebted nations 
such as mexico and brazil because they are not among the poorest

droughts are parching pastures and cutting crop yields from the 
northern plains across the midwest letting wells go dry in parts 
of the southeast and imposing rationing on irrigators and 
homeowners in california 
ive never seen apple trees wilt in may in my life but i have 
this year said horticulturalist mike thomas of paw paw mich 
in my judgment there hasnt been a drought like this since 
the 30s north dakota gov george sinner said last week after 
touring scorched areas of his state 
well probably starve the grasshoppers to death if we dont 
get rain thats the good part said ken solberg who owns a 
livestock auction market in rugby nd 
an unusually dry and hot spring is to blame on much of the 
plains and midwest but in the southeast the tennessee valley is 
heading into its fourth dry year 
the west coast has had two dry winters especially in the 
mountains where the snowpack supplies much of the regions water 
and irrigation districts and municipal systems are adopting 
voluntary or mandatory water saving 
in georgia almost every government in the atlanta area has 
restricted the hours when lawns can be watered and cars washed and 
people are snitching on neighbors who break the rules state 
wildlife biologist bill cooper says coyotes have taken to raiding 
watermelon patches in the area 
indiana cities water corp threatened to disconnect service to 
homeowners who ignored a ban on lawn sprinkling communities across 
illinois also are pleading for conservation 
this is supposedly our rainiest season of the year said 
forecaster al morrison in chicago where only 177 inches of rain 
had fallen since april 7 when 774 inches is normal 
total crop loss wont be known until harvest time for now crop 
damage is showing up largely in shriveling leaves and plants 
stubbier than expected for this time of year 
within the next week if we dont get rain our smallgrain 
crop is going to be 75 percent lost said don friederich 
executive director of the minnesota agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service 
in some places plants never had a chance 
on his tour last week north dakotas governor kneeled in dusty 
fields and dug up wheat and barley kernels that had never 
germinated what crops had sprouted had grown just a few inches 
in some hardhit areas of northwestern ohio some farmers have 
plowed crops under rather than face sharply reduced yields while 
still bearing the costs of fertilizing said alan brugler of the 
140000family ohio farm bureau federation 
the effects of the heat and lack of rain appear sooner in early 
maturing hay crops 
normally we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year the 
yield from the first cutting was way down and there wont be much 
of a second cutting said don keyes of the minnesota agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service much of the state has less 
than half normal rain this year 
dry pastures forced david rendahl who farms 2800 acres near 
fillmore nd to let his 70 cows graze clover he was going to 
save for the winter he said thats supposed to be january hay 
and im eating it now rendahl said 
the department of agriculture is already allowing farmers to cut 
hay or let animals graze land that was set aside for crop reduction 
or conservation in struggling counties in montana the dakotas 
nebraska iowa missouri wisconsin minnesota illinois indiana 
and ohio 
the grain futures market in chicago has surged upward as traders 
bet on a smaller and smaller harvest soybean futures rose 25 
percent in a month and on friday broke the 9abushel barrier 
highest since late 1983 oats traded last week up to the daily 
limit 10 cents raised to 15 cents at midweek four of the five 
days 
the only down day of the week was wednesday when the market 
opened sharply lower after reports that parts of iowa got rain 
with more than 5 inches at coon rapids and almost 2 at des moines 
but the showers were spotty and the forecast was for continued 
warm dry weather 
a report by the state statistical bureau said iowa pastures were 
at their june 1 driest since 1956 
rain that falls on most of the area between the rockies and the 
appalachians ultimately drains into the mississippi river and the 
water level has been dropping the coast guard said the river fell 
almost 2 feet on june 5 and 55 barges were reported grounded the 
next day near memphis tenn 
a lot of the towboat companies are starting to restrict the 
size of the tows going through and starting to restrict the draft 
of the barges said coast guard lt tony buancore of memphis 
in the southeast western north carolina is in the grip of a 
nearrecord drought state officials say the next two to three 
weeks are critical although it may already be too late to save 
some crops 
corn is just laying there not enough moisture to germinate 
it said buncombe county nc extension agent bobby peek 
a lot of our wells have gone dry too peek said they 
usually come back in winter but many didnt come back this winter 
the few wells we have are now going deeper five to six years ago 
150 feet was considered pretty deep for a well now we go twice 
that depth 
tennessee valley authority reservoirs are dwindling said 
spokesman richard urban through may the sevenstate tennessee 
river basin got 137 inches of rain against a normal 23 inches 
the worsthit lake in the tva region is fontana lake in western 
north carolina which is 45 feet below normal said urban 
tennessees douglas lake one of tvas major tributary storage 
reservoirs is 22 feet below normal 
smallgrain production in south carolina has probably been cut 
by at least one third by the weather said jake barker the 
anderson county extension service agent most of our fescue 
pastures are burned or grazed out corn is beginning to feel the 
pressure and soybean planting hasnt even begun 
in california drought plagues a state where water demand is 
growing with the population san francisco and los angeles have 
ordered water rationing some emergency regulations pack stinging 
penalties 
february and march were the driest for that period this 
century in the northern sierra which supplies more than half the 
water the state uses said maurice roos chief hydrologist at the 
state department of water resources thats what put a real hole 
in the water supply picture 
that lack of snow has also left hydroelectric reservoirs falling 
on the columbia river in washington while at the same time water 
must be released to help migrating salmon 
growers who have been notified that irrigation allotments will 
be as low as 35 percent of normal are planning to use techniques 
learned in the last drought and to pump water from underground 
said california farm bureau spokesman mike henry 
water storage was estimated in late may at about 80 percent of 
normal in californias 151 largest reservoirs but that includes 
levels of just 47 percent of normal in the five north lahontan 
reservoirs in the eastern sierra

financier carl c icahn has tripled to 300 
million the money he would forfeit if he failed to raise the 
necessary financing for his takeover offer for texaco inc 
texacos largest shareholder also pledged in a statement on 
thursday that the money would go to texaco stockholders rather 
than the companys general treasury 
icahns bid of 60 a share which values texaco at 146 
billion has failed to impress wall street since it was announced 
last month shares of the white plains nybased oil giant have 
traded 9 to 10 below his offer 
in nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted issues 
thursday texaco closed at 5137 down 12 cents a share 
texacos board rejected icahns bid for the 852 percent of the 
companys shares he does not already own it also refused to put 
the matter up for a vote by stockholders at the annual meeting june 
17 
on thursday a company statement said icahns latest move 
changes exactly nothing 
and nothing is exactly what he is offering the texaco 
shareholder it added because he has attached such a jungle of 
strings conditions and red tape to his socalled guarantee it 
doesnt matter what number he attaches to it hes never put up a 
dime and we are convinced he would never have to 
icahns proposal includes provisions that the money would not be 
forfeited if another bid in excess of 60 per share materialized 
or if the internal revenue service failed to approve his proposal 
those provisions duplicate others in his original bid except 
that in that case icahn only offered to put 100 million into 
escrow and said it would be forfeited to the company if he could 
not finance the offer 
on thursday icahn said he would triple that amount but changed 
the potential recipient of the money to texacos shareholders 
instead of the company 
the guarantee is 150 in cash per share to all texaco 
stockholders of record for a special stockholder meeting we are 
seeking icahn said in a statement 
icahn is joining four colleagues in running for five board seats 
up for election at the companys annual meeting 
he says he wants the seats on the 14member board to pressure 
the board to put his takeover proposal before the companys 
approximately 211000 shareholders 
both sides have been waging intense efforts to woo the 
shareholders support in the proxy battle 
since monday the company has announced several developments in 
its plan to sell 5 billion worth of assets including the sale of 
its west german subsidiary for 12 billion and a pledge to 
distribute a third of the proceeds from all of the sales to 
shareholders 
the company was vague about exactly how those proceeds would be 
spread saying it would come in cash some form of security or in a 
stock buyback plan but it promised shareholders would see their 
third of the proceeds by the end of the year 
on thursday icahn said he was sending letters to texaco 
shareholders telling them they had everything to gain and nothing 
to lose with his proposal 
even if for some reason you do not want icahn on the texaco 
board for the long term you have nothing to lose by voting for us 
because either you will get 60 or better or he will be off the 
board icahn wrote 
he was referring to an earlier pledge that the slate would 
resign if his bid is rejected in a subsequent shareholder vote 
in his announcement on the 300 million guarantee icahn took 
another swipe at management saying his side had absolutely no 
confidence that it would or could use the funds in a manner 
beneficial to stockholders 
management has shown us that they are unable to generate an 
acceptable rate of return on assets he said 
texaco in its response characterized the financiers recent 
moves as desperate ploys saying that in contrast texaco has 
already taken real action to build real value for all its 
shareholders

consumer prices restrained by a novel 
inflationfighting campaign rose 19 percent in may to register 
the smallest increase since november 1981 the government reported 
it was the fourth consecutive month that the inflation rate had 
eased 
the bank of mexico the nations central bank on thursday 
attributed the brighter price picture to the government program 
unveiled by president miguel de la madrid in middecember 
the results it said show clearly that as a consequence of 
the economic solidarity pact the inflationary process has been 
deaccelerated in a sustained manner 
de la madrid announced the program after officials became 
worried that the nation was on the verge of spiraling into 
hyperinflation a problem that has plagued other latin american 
countries 
consumer prices skyrocketed a record 1592 percent last year in 
january those costs soared 155 percent for the biggest onemonth 
gain 
prices climbed 83 percent in february 51 percent in march and 
31 percent in april 
the report said overall consumer prices rose 11 percent in the 
last two weeks of may 
the producer price index those costs paid by producers of 
goods and services went up 10 percent in may 
a key component of the inflationfighting program is a freeze on 
the minimum wage prices of governmentregulated goods and services 
and the exchange rate of the peso currency

if a group of farmstate lawmakers has its 
way the government will soon start paying more for less less 
dirt in grain that is 
legislation approved by the house last month would establish a 
pilot project to pay some farmers a higher price for cleaner grain 
the idea is to keep grain free of dust broken kernels chaff and 
foreign materials such as weed seeds the senate agriculture 
committee endorsed a similar proposal last wednesday 
i just think we need to build incentives into our whole grain 
delivery system that encourage farmers to deliver a cleaner product 
and encourage the handlers of grain to keep the product clean once 
its delivered to them clean says rep jim slattery dkan a 
sponsor of the measure 
he and others contend that the united states needs to improve 
the cleanliness of grain it offers to foreign buyers canada and 
australia two major wheat exporters have established reputations 
for selling highquality clean grain 
the global grain market is going to become increasingly 
competitive in the 1990s and i dont want to see american farmers 
lose the sale of one bushel of grain because cleaner grain was 
available someplace else says slattery 
wheat delivered to japan between 1983 and 1987 from the united 
states contained almost twice as much foreign material and 
dockage as that arriving from canada and nearly 25 times as 
much as from australia according to information from us wheat 
associates and the japan food agency 
under the current us system federal standards call for 
discounts on dirty grain but allow for a certain amount of foreign 
material in shipments of grain 
to take advantage of the system the industry blends clean grain 
with dirtier grain which is purchased at lower prices to form 
average shipments selling at market prices in fact it is through 
this blending of grain that the industry largely earns its profit 
critics say 
gary gilbert a clay center kan elevator operator is an 
outspoken advocate of cleaner grain which he says is cheaper to 
store and transport 
the grain takes up less space drying and aeration costs less 
clean grain also is safer to handle because there is less of a 
hazard from explosive dust cleaning grain also reduces insect 
damage insects feed on and live in the fine trashy materials at 
issue in the clean grain controversy 
from his county elevator perspective gilbert sees the solution 
as a system that removes the profitmaking incentives for grain 
blending and instead provides premiums for the delivery of clean 
grain by producers and in keeping it clean all the way to export 
terminals 
we have to have an incentive program there that everytime we 
handle it we want it to be the very best says gilbert 
under the house legislation higher prices would be paid to 
farmers in some areas for clean wheat corn and soybeans placed 
into the government price support loan program which allows 
farmers to forfeit their grain to the commodity credit corporation 
and keep the federal loan monies 
a pilot project would be established for the 1989 crop year in 
at least three multicounty areas one in a wheatgrowing region 
one in corn country and one in a soybeanproducing region the 
senate proposal by sen kent conrad dnd calls for six 
experimental zones two in each commodity 
the house proposal provides for the secretary of the agriculture 
department to determine the areas the amount of the premiums and 
the grain cleanliness standard the measure does not provide for 
additional discounts for dirty or average grain it also would not 
apply to grain sold in commercial markets 
slatterys original bill called for a nationwide system of 
higher prices for exceptionally clean cccstored grain but that 
was scaled back in order to build support 
if the pilot project proves successful and if we can work the 
kinks out of the concept i hope that we can make this part of the 
farm bill in 1990 says slattery 
not everyone in the grain industry is sold on the legislation 
i have some doubts on how helpful it might really be says 
bob petersen president of the national grain trade council its 
probably a noble idea but looks to be incredibly complicated to 
administer 
under current grain standards he maintains foreign buyers can 
specify extremely clean grain if they want to pay for it petersen 
also says that the number of complaints about us grain quality 
has dropped this year 
in a down market foreign complaints tend to assume a lot more 
visibility than they do in a sellers market he says 
david frey of the kansas wheat commission says the success of 
the proposal will depend upon the premiums fixed by usda he 
worries that the experiment is too limited and will not provide 
enough information to lawmakers on whether a priceincentive system 
will work nationwide 
the concept is excellent im sorry that its going to be just 
in certain areas because id like to see it go across the 
country says frey there is the potential for it to very 
significantly affect the way grain is physically handled in the 
us

arab oil ministers failed this week to 
agree on production cuts called for in discussions with several 
nonopec oilexporting countries officials said friday 
the arab oil exporters remained divided between a 
westernoriented group resisting a 5 percent cut by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries and a group led by 
algeria and libya that supported it 
the ministers met during this weeks arab summit here 
at a meeting in april seven nonopec nations agreed to reduce 
their exports by 183000 barrels per day a 5 percent cut if 
opec would implement a matching 5 percent cut 
the opec countries which have a current overall production 
ceiling of 1506 million barrels per day offered to match the 
proposed nonopec cut barrelperbarrel but could not agree on an 
overall 5 percent cut that would have lowered their ceiling by 
about 750000 barrels per day 
algeria and libya advocate production cuts while saudi arabia 
and the gulf emirates have defended their production levels 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
ministers expressed the hope their differences could be overcome at 
the meeting scheduled to open in vienna on saturday between opec 
and nonopec producers 
the algerian news agency distributed a statement that the arab 
oil ministers had reached an agreement on the need for all opec 
member countries to adhere to their undertaking to respect their 
production quotas and their defense of oil prices 
the statement appeared to be an attempt to present an appearance 
of unanimity 
the nonopec members involved in the dialogue with opec are 
angola china colombia egypt mexico oman and malaysia norway 
is attending the meeting as observer while britain is not 
represented 
the oil ministers attending the arab summit which closed 
thursday were those of saudi arabia kuwait qatar the united 
arab emirates libya and algeria

national broadcasting co has decided against 
buying the cable channel tempo television for its proposed business 
news service but plans instead to lease time on the channel for the 
new programming 
the general electric co unit which owns the nbc television 
network cited tax considerations for its change in strategy 
buying the cable channel was seen as part of nbc president 
robert wrights oftstated plans to broaden the broadcasting 
concerns business base 
nbc announced last month it had signed a letter of intent to buy 
tempo television and would use it for new business news and sports 
programming 
tempo television a unit of tempo enterprises inc of tulsa 
okla currently provides outdoors travel and informational 
programming to about 12 million subscribers 
nbc had planned to acquire the channel from telecommunications 
inc a denverbased cable operator which is in the process of 
buying tempo enterprises in a deal expected to close in the third 
quarter 
on thursday nbc and telecommunications said they were 
restructuring their plans to minimize tax and other complications 
that arose from trying to separate tempo television from its 
parent tempo enterprises 
under the new plan the companies said nbc would lease time on 
tempo television for a business news service that would run from 6 
am to 8 pm weekdays starting in early 1989 
under the new arrangement nbc will still own and manage the 
business news service but will reach existing tempo tv subscribers 
without actually purchasing tempo tv the announcement said 
it said that tempo television would try to help the business 
news service succeed by paying the first years affiliation fee on 
behalf of all current tempo tv affiliates who continue to carry 
tempo fulltime after the launch of the business news service 
john draper a spokesman for telecommunications said the new 
arrangement gives nbc the same thing that they were after when 
it planned to buy the cable channel access to a large base of 
subscribers 
he declined to specify how much nbc would pay for the lease it 
had been reported that nbc had agreed to pay about 20 million to 
buy the channel 
the statement did not indicate what the new plans were for 
introduction of the proposed sports programing that nbc previously 
said it would put on the cable channel 
john malone president of telecommunications said in the 
statement that his company will continue to explore with nbc the 
best format for sports and other possible programming for a prime 
time and weekend service 
thomas s rogers the nbc executive overseeing the tempo deal 
was unavailable for comment 
but joseph rutledge an nbc spokesman said today that the 
change to a lease arrangement posed no obstacle to nbc 
accomplishing what it set out to do 
some people choose to lease a car some people choose to buy a 
car both people end up with transportation we are ending up with 
the very outcome we sought he said 
the new arrangement will give nbc access to cable subscribers a 
solid relationship with telecommunications which is the nations 
biggest cable operator and an opportunity to develop two new 
programming services for cable tv rutledge said 
he said that nbc continues to talk with cable operators about 
what they would like to see in a sports service and that nbc hopes 
to begin developing sports programming for cable tv soon after the 
business news service goes on the air 
wright was quoted in the statement as saying the cable 
industry has been very encouraging and we are enthusiastic about 
our plans going forward

texas investor robert m bass succeeded in 
derailing macmillan incs restructuring plan friday when a state 
judge in delaware ordered the publishing giant to refrain from 
paying a special dividend 
jack b jacobs a judge in chancery court in wilmington del 
issued a temporary restraining order preventing macmillan from 
paying the 5235ashare dividend which was to be the first phase 
in a restructuring plan that also included splitting the company in 
two 
the move put pressure on the macmillan board to either seriously 
consider basss 19 billon buyout offer or to top it in some other 
fashion earlier this week the board rejected basss offer as 
inadequate 
analysts had expected some form of delay and said macmillan was 
now on the defensive 
macmillan stock which had fallen 225 a share thursday jumped 
237 a share to 7587 in afternoon trading on the new york 
stock exchange 
the market is saying that this is going to go back and forth a 
few times yet said bruce thorp an analyst at provident national 
bank in philadelphia 
macmillan spokesman david jackson said i have no comment 
theres nothing to say 
jacobs who heard arguments at a crowded hearing for several 
hours late thursday issued his decision the day macmillan planned 
to begin paying the dividend the order will be in effect until a 
hearing is held on whether a preliminary injunction should be 
issued 
macmillan put a value of 64 a share on its restructuring which 
called for the special dividend and dividing the companys 
publishing and information services operations into separate 
publicly held concerns 
under the plan macmillan management would control 39 percent of 
the new information company and would be provided lucrative 
financial protections against losing their jobs after any takeover 
bass has offered to acquire macmillan for 73 a share in cash 
or alternatively to pay a 58ashare dividend in his own 
restructuring he already owns 91 percent of the companys 26 
million shares outstanding 
his attorneys argued that macmillans board breached its 
fiduciary duties by failing to get the best price for its 
shareholders 
according to lawyers present at the hearing jacobs said 
macmillan shareholders could be harmed if the restructuring went 
through 
coniston partners which controls 49 percent of macmillan and 
supported basss legal efforts expressed pleasure at the judges 
decision 
were happy about it but it was pretty patently obvious 
said coniston general partner paul e tierney jr theres still a 
law against stealing and management was attempting a 
recapitalization that transfered control to them without their 
paying 
principals of the aggressive new york investment firm value 
macmillan at between 85 and 100 a share and have said they are 
seeking a full auction for the company 
analysts said the next move was macmillans the whole point 
of the injunction is to force macmillan to respond to basss 
offer thorp said 
both bass and coniston are likely to wait and see what 
macmillan comes back with before taking any further action he 
said 
we have built our investment on the theory that ultimately the 
shareholders will win out tierney said we are vigilant 
observers but have no comment on any action on our part 
macmillan has its own legal action pending in federal court in 
new york where it has charged bass and his affiliates with 
violating securities laws repeatedly filing and disseminating 
false information and engaging in a creeping tenders

a former top western union corp executive 
set up a network of double agents to establish a rival to the 
troubled telecommunications company and used his position to steal 
latin american business from it western union charges 
but a lawyer for the executive john lanzelotti of port reading 
nj said friday the suit was in retaliation for fee and expense 
claims by latin american agent companies and denied the charges 
some of the defendants who include former western union south 
american sales agents and an israeli company illegally tried to 
supply helicopters and other equipment to armed forces in peru and 
ecuador and other countries said the suit filed wednesday in 
federal court in newark 
the suit also charges that defendants bribed communications 
authorities in latin american nations including ecuador bolivia 
and suriname to gain their business 
western union claims that lanzelotti who left the company feb 
12 after six years worked on behalf of the alleged 
racketeering enterprise while he was western unions regional 
vice president for the western hemisphere 
it is our allegation that while mr lanzelotti was a western 
union employee we are certain that he had put into place a 
number of agents in latin america that were truly double agents 
said western union lawyer susan littman 
the defendants had worldwide aspirations to set up a rival 
telecommunications company to supply telex and electronic mail 
services she said they used telex services western union provides 
free to its employees to further their goals even selling it to 
others and keeping the money the complaint said 
the complaint provided little detail on the allegations about 
helicopter sales and ms littman would not comment further 
we know that the defendants were involved in these 
activities as part of the conspiracy she said 
lanzelotti reached by telephone at his attorneys office in 
carteret nj referred questions to his lawyer louis jr kady 
kady denied the claims but said he would not address them 
specifically 
our position is that while he was working for western union 
lanzelotti was working for western union and did what he was 
supposed to do for them kady said 
he said the company was retaliating against firms that were 
seeking expenses and fees from it 
lanzelotti had a substantial financial interest in 
woodbridge njbased intelco international inc and related 
companies in panama and venezuela and announced he had become 
intelcos president on feb 11 the day he was fired the suit said 
kady said lanzelotti owns a third of intelcos stock but only 
acquired it after leaving western union 
he helped plan western unions strategies in dealing with latin 
american governments and communications authorities and used his 
position to steer business to intelco and other defendants the 
suit said 
when he learned last year that western union was bidding to 
supply services to brazil lanzelotti pretending to represent his 
employer traveled there and tried to seize the opportunity for 
himself and his alleged coconspirators the suit said 
the defendants also tried to divert western unions business by 
pretending intelco was acting on its behalf the complaint said 
western union based in upper saddle river nj recently 
reorganized to avoid having to file for bankruptcy protection

opec oil ministers began arriving friday 
for their regular midyear gathering prepared to grapple again 
with their biggest problem how to deal with the world oil glut 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 13 members 
nations most of whose delegations arrived a day before saturdays 
opening session are deeply divided over ways to boost prices 
through production cuts 
the cartel is split over whether to change an existing agreement 
among 12 of its members to limit daily production to 1506 million 
barrels the pact which was extended in december and is due to 
expire june 30 was aimed at supporting oil prices at 18 a barrel 
but opec oil has been selling for about 150 below that 
iraq refused to sign because it wants a quota equal to that of 
its enemy iran 
oil experts predicted the cartel would be unable to reach a 
consenus on how to tackle the problem and would end up extending 
its existing agreement through the rest of the year 
it will be a rollover of what theyve got said harry 
neustein a new yorkbased oil trader attending the opec meeting 
the oil futures markets also showed little optimism friday 
in trading on the new york mercantile exchange the july 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil 
closed down 34 cents a barrel to 1673 on friday 
oil prices have been weak amid reports that many opec members 
have exceeded the daily production cap and as worldwide oil 
reserves continue to rise 
in addition some nonopec oil nations which produce around 
232 million barrels a day failed in late arpil to get opec to 
agree to jointly cut production that was the first major effort to 
form a worldwide alliance among oil producers to boost prices 
these competing nonopec producers which are producing more and 
more of the worlds oil and now account for 60 percent of output 
also have been making significant new oil discoveries 
meanwhile rumors have been circulating particularly out of 
the arab summit in algeria this week that iran and iraq might be 
close to agreeing to end their 8yearold persian gulf war that 
would result in a sharp increase in the two countries oil ouput 
putting further pressure on oil prices experts said 
opecs other members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela 
longerterm all oil producers are being asked to meet less of 
the worlds energy needs in the face of competition from other 
sources natural gas nuclear energy coal and others 
crude oil provides about 50 percent of the worlds energy 
consumption of crude oil in noncommunist nations has fallen to 50 
million barrels a day from a peak of 57 million barrels a day in 
1979 
even though oil demand is expected to increase in the second 
half of the year youre living in a wash of energy now not a 
shortage of energy said neustein

the securities and exchange commission on 
friday moved toward tightening the requirements for deciding 
whether mutual funds can describe themselves as noload funds 
mutual funds collect money from investors to purchase stocks 
bonds precious metals or other securities or commodities and most 
charge a management fee the broker or agent who sells shares in 
the fund also gets a sales fee 
however in noload funds which many investors prefer the 
shares are usually purchased directly from the fund and no sales 
fee is charged but since 1980 noload funds have been allowed to 
use some of the money from investors to pay for certain sales and 
promotional expenses 
the commission voted 40 friday to ask for comment on a proposal 
that would tighten regulation of how these socalled 12b1 
expenses are assessed against mutual funds it would also prohibit 
funds that assess these hidden distribution charges from describing 
themselves as noload funds 
sec officials are expecting great interest from investment 
companies on how the rules are structured but kathryn b mcgrath 
director of the division of investment management said we hope 
individual investors would communicate with us on these rules as 
well 
in other action the commission voted 40 to propose and ask for 
comment on two measures designed to make it easier to trade us 
stocks internationally 
regulation of that area has become increasingly complex in 
recent years with the explosion of new technology and the 
globalization of financial markets 
the first proposal would exempt foreign brokers from registering 
with the sec provided the broker lives outside the united states 
and conducts all trading outside the country 
however if foreign brokers want to solicit sales from us 
institutional investors like pension and mutual funds they would 
have to work with a broker registered in the united states and 
records relating to the sales would have to be kept within the 
country 
unregistered foreign brokers would also be prohibited from 
targeting sales at us citizens abroad such as personnel on 
military bases 
the thrust of this rule is to loosen up access to our markets 
to foreign brokers but when you come right down to the bottom 
line they have to have a connection with a us broker said sec 
commissioner aulana peters 
in the second measure the sec is proposing a new regulation 
governing initial sales of us corporate stock abroad stock 
issued for sale to us citizens has to be registered with the sec 
but us stock intended only for sale to foreigners need not be 
registered 
the proposal provides a 90day period in which backflow 
sales to us citizens would be restricted the procedures are 
aimed at preventing stock issuers from selling stocks abroad solely 
as a means of circumventing sec registration requirements

the worlds leading exchange for platinum 
futures faced with a shortage of elbow room has accepted an offer 
to move its platinum trading pit to the floor of the worlds 
leading gold and silver exchange officials said friday 
the agreement between the commodity exchange the premier market 
for gold and silver futures and the new york mercantile exchange 
will require approval by the commodity futures trading commission 
officials said 
the comex and the nymex new yorks two largest futures 
exchanges operate sidebyside along with three other futures 
exchanges in the world trade center in lower manhattan 
space is at a premium but the comex has found itself with an 
empty trading pit or ring since the failure earlier this year 
of a corporatebond index contract said gina greer a comex 
spokeswoman 
since everyone is so crowded here we thought wed be nice 
guys and offer them at a price that ring she said 
nymex chairman william m bradt said the nymex board accepted 
the proposal on wednesday and was awaiting final approval from the 
comex board 
under the agreement comex members would be allowed to trade 
platinum futures for their own accounts but not for clients bradt 
said 
in return for the use of its pit nymex would pay comex half of 
the annual platinum clearing fees or 1 million a year whichever 
is more 
bradt said the change would probably stimulate greater trading 
volume in both platinum and gold futures 
the nymex board also voted to continue merger discussions with 
comex he said

an investor said friday that his groups 28 
billion cash bid to take over centel corp still stands despite 
rejection by the companys chairman 
the investment group led by asher b edelman and george l 
lindemann had set a june 10 deadline in a letter announcing their 
bid late last month 
centel chairman john p frazee jr dismissed the offer when it 
was received may 31 after consulting the companys board of 
directors and investment bankers and has not reconsidered 
spokesman bill white said friday 
the proposal was not a credible offer white said we said 
at that time we believed that the offer was a tactical device 
designed to affect the outcome of the proxy fight 
edelmans group has proposed a threeman slate of directors to 
fill slots on centels 11member board shareholders will have a 
chance to decide between those candidates and a threeman slate 
nominated by centel at the companys annual meeting on june 28 
white said 
edelman a new yorkbased financier whose group holds 55 
percent of centels stock denied that the takeover bid was a 
maneuver in the proxy fight 
but he said in a telephone interview friday i think the 
shareholders certainly will look hard at what weve done about our 
position in our company 
edelman said frazees unilateral turndown of our offer 
will show the shareholders exactly what type of person he is and 
what he thinks of their interests 
in the initial letter to centel management edelman and 
lindemann chairman of a new yorkbased mobile phone business 
called metro mobile cts inc said their group was willing to pay 
65 a share for each of centels approximately 43 million shares 
outstanding 
but they conditioned the offer on centels canceling an 
agreement to pay 763 million to buy united telespectrum the 
cellular telephone subsidiary of united telecommunications of 
kansas city they said they would drop the bid to 60 a share if 
centel held to the deal which was announced in late may 
frazee said at the time that the companys plan to acquire 
united telespectrum and its 95 million debt would provide a far 
better return for investors than any shortterm gain under the 
edelman groups proposal to sell off centel assets to boost stock 
values 
centel is going ahead with plans to acquire united telespectrum 
white said 
edelman called the united telespectrum deal overpriced and 
said if its completed his group would tender its lower offer for 
centel

yield unchanged from late thursday at nearly 904 percent 
the labor department reported friday that wholesale prices rose 
a moderate 05 percent in may roughly the same as in the two 
previous months 
buyers of fixedincome securities such as bonds watch indicators 
like the governments producer price index for signals of 
accelerating inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome 
investments but fridays report largely was in line with forecasts 
of economists and prompted little movement in bond prices analysts 
said 
analysts also noted that bond prices which move inversely from 
interest rates hit their highs of the day as oil futures prices 
fell late in the trading session 
furthermore analysts said bond prices may have been aided by 
sluggishness in the federal funds rate the interest charged on 
overnight loans between banks and a widely watched indicator of 
shortterm rate trends fed funds traded at 7 516 percent late 
friday up only slightly from 7 percent late thursday 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues fell 116 point intermediate maturities were

takeover strategist carl c icahn said friday he 
was forming a new holding company to act as his sole vehicle for 
acquisitions including a possible hostile takeover bid for texaco 
inc 
icahn texacos biggest shareholder said the holding company 
intended to raise up to 325 billion through an offering of 500 
million to 750 million in common stock and about 25 billion in 
debt securities 
the icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the 
holding company including its 361 million shares of texaco and 
its interests in trans world airlines inc and acf a leasing 
company 
in a news release issued late friday icahn indicated that 
acquisitions to be pursued by the new holding company included the 
possible pursuit of texaco in which icahn controls a 148 percent 
stake 
texaco has rejected icahns proposal for a buyout of the company 
for 60 per common share which values the company at 146 billion 
icahn also is running himself and four colleagues for five board 
seats up for election at the companys annual meeting in an attempt 
to pressure texaco to let its shareholders vote on his buyout offer 
icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the 
board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer he would 
consider making a hostile bid through the new holding company at 
yet to be determined terms 
texaco stock rose 62 cents to 5187 a share friday on the new 
york stock exchange 
a spokesman for the white plains nybased oil giant said 
texaco had no immediate comment on icahns announcement 
icahn has indicated previously that he might consider a hostile 
bid for texaco but had yet to make any public moves in that 
direction until friday 
separately a federal judge in white plains ordered icahns 
proxy solicitors to stop making false statements in soliciting 
support from texaco shareholders in the board election 
us district judge gerard goettel made the ruling after viewing 
a videotape of thursdays macneillehrer report on the public 
broadcasting system 
on the program an unidentified employee of df king an icahn 
proxy solicitor said icahn had 100 million in escrow to return to 
shareholders should he be unable to finance his takeover bid 
icahn has stated that if texaco put his 60 a share offer to a 
shareholder vote he would end his proxy fight and put the 100 
million in escrow for payment to shareholders in the event he 
could not arrange financing for the bid by the date of the 
shareholder vote on thursday he raised the guarantee to 300 
million 
the money has not yet been placed in escrow contrary to the 
df king employees remarks on the broadcast texaco sought an 
outright correction but goettel said an evidentiary hearing must 
take place first and only enjoined solicitors from making false 
remarks

a department of transportation law judge said 
friday there was no public interest reason to yank the 
seattletokyo air route from united airlines and recommended that 
applications by american and continental airlines to take over the 
route be rejected 
the department now has 90 days to reach a final decision in the 
bitter dispute over the route flown by united since 1983 
judge burton kolko said that if united were to be replaced on 
the route he would recommend that american take its place but 
kolko said he could find no reason to do so 
the only calls for uniteds removal are from those who would 
profit in its stead said kolko if united is deficient in 
meeting passengers needs then it has managed to fool a lot of 
people 
while conceeding that both american and continental could 
operate profitably on this route kolko said united had a 
proven record of sucessful operation of the route 
with this decision from judge kolko we are confident that the 
department of transportation will rule in our favor and allow 
united to keep this route in which we have invested heavily over 
the past 21 years said stephen wolf united president chairman 
and chief executive officer 
kolko said that united had strong support from the seattle 
community and elected officials and its connecting route network in 
both the far east and domestically was broader than the other two 
airlines 
robert l crandall americans chairman and president said 
kolkos decision was antithetical to the us national 
interests 
we simply cannot understand why the law judge despite the 
fact that dot has repeatedly called for competition in the pacific 
from several west coast hubs by multiple us carriers would 
recommend leaving all three west coast gateways in the hands of a 
single airline crandall said 
kolko said that even though some poohpooh the importance of 
uniteds other routes in asia it is a major public interest 
matter for those traveling to the far east 
kolko rejected arguments from both continental and american that 
the lower fares they planned to introduce would increase 
competition 
only the most pollyanish can believe that the fare proposals 
in this case will ever see the light of day kolko said adding 
that because of japanese resistance to lower fares the proposals 
from american and cotinental were pieinthesky 
kolko also dismissed statements from the other airlines that 
united had tried to blackmail seattle officials and the 
department into supporting its effort to retain the route by 
threatening to scale back operations at seattletacoma 
international airport if it wasnt sucessful 
it is clear that this community wants united for reasons that 
transcend route case blackmail kolko said 
during hearings before kolko earlier this year wolf said it 
would be unfair for the department to strip his airline of the 
route after it spent years trying to acquire it sunk millions of 
dollars into developing it and at a time when it was just becomming 
profitable 
crandall told kolko that united which also flies between los 
angeles and tokyo and san francisco and tokyo wanted to retain 
the seattle route just to block other airlines from gaining a 
foothold in the far east market 
crandall said that if american were awarded the route it would 
expand aggressively into asian markets and was committed to 
building a new hub at seatac at a cost of between 100 million and 
150 million 
united had previously warned that it would have to cancel its 
seattlehong kong route if it lost the tokyo route and transfer 
many of its 3000 workers based at seatac 
a 20 million united expansion at seatac was also put on hold 
pending a decision on the route 
continental chairman frank lorenzo told kolko that his airline 
was prepared to introduce vigorous price competition into the 
pacific market if it was awarded the seattletokyo route including 
oneway fares as low as 299

the air force on friday accused one of its 
large contractors of defaulting on a key electronics contract 
saying it was canceling the order and would demand repayment of 39 
million in progress payments 
it also vowed to force the company the eaton corp to cover 
any extra costs the government incurred in finding a new contractor 
to perform the work 
the air force said it was terminating for default an 815 
million contract awarded four years ago to eatons ail division in 
deer park ny for development of a new tactical jamming system 
for its ef111a jet aircraft 
the ef111a is an electronic warfare version of the f111 
bomber meaning it is specially equipped to fool or jam enemy radar 
and radio systems during bombing attacks the air force had planned 
to upgrade its fleet of 42 such planes after eaton developed the 
new jamming system 
eaton was selected for the development work in october 1984 
after it won a bidding contest with the grumman corp 
the air force said friday it was terminating the contract 
because eaton was now estimating it would cost 153 million to 
perform the work or an overrun of 715 million and an extra 30 
months beyond the specified completion date of july 1987 
the contractor was terminated for failure to make progress so 
as to endanger performance and for failure to meet a required 
delivery the air force said in a statement 
alternatives to this contract are now being addressed by a 
highlevel steering group convened by the commander of the air 
force systems command the service added 
renald romain a spokesman for the cleveland ohiobased eaton 
declined comment beyond asserting the the company believes it 
has meritorious defenses against claims which the air force may 
assert in connection with this termination 
eaton has been attempting to sell its ail division since last 
october to date without success that division had earlier come 
under fire for technical deficiencies in producing similar 
electronic warfare gear for the new b1b bomber 
according to gerda parr an air force spokeswoman eaton ail had 
received progress payments totaling slightly more than 39 million 
since winning the contract in 1984 
as far as the air force is concerned only 19500 worth of work 
was delivered and we will immediately demand repayment of the 39 
million in progress payments she said 
the governments position also is that ail is legally 
responsible for any additional costs that the government may incur 
as a result of reprocuring from another contractor

the united auto workers and a brighton car 
customizing firm continued contract talks friday aimed at ending a 
650worker strike that has halted production of the ford mustang 
convertible and other vehicles 
theyre pretty close were still hoping we can get that thing 
settled said stan marshall director of uaw region ic which 
includes brighton 
workers at campc which stands for cars amp concepts voted to be 
represented by the uaw earlier this year but company protests 
delayed certification of the union until april 1 marshall said 
when negotiations on campcs first uaw contract bogged down 
leaders of newly formed uaw local 4077 set a strike deadline for 
midnight tuesday then extended it 10 am wednesday when workers 
walked out 
marshall said the two sides still had to settle differences over 
wages seniority rights pensions and other benefits wages for 
jobs in the same classification can range from 4 an hour to 11 an 
hour 
the uaw wants workers who do the same job to be paid the same 
wage marshall said 
campc inc which also is modifying chrysler corp models for 
export to europe and working on fourwheeldrive chassis for 
general motors corp is owned by masco industries inc 
the strike interrupted production of the ford mustang 
convertible which ford spokesman rod seib said was the 
bestselling convertible in the united states during 1987 
seib said the strike is costing ford and its dealers about 160 
mustang convertibles a day during the height of the convertible 
selling season ford sold 25212 of the convertibles in 1987 and 
has room to build about 33000 in 1988 
all mustang models remain in short supply 35 days worth 
compared to the industry norm of 6065 days worth but the 
convertibles are particularly scarce seib said 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said earlier that the strike 
could force chrysler to find another company to modify cars for its 
reentry into the european market which began about six weeks ago 
chrysler hopes to export 5000 to 10000 cars a year to europe

the growth in the labor departments producer price index for

of an inflationary boom are overblown said larry chimerine

economic forecasting consultant in bala cynwyd pa 
the white house also took comfort from the may numbers 
inflation remains low and under control said spokesman marlin 
fitzwater

wholesale prices last month according to the report at the prices 
paid by grocery stores food rose 09 percent in may the biggest 
increase since a 17 percent jump in january 
energy prices which had surged 31 percent in april rose only 
02 percent in may largely because of a 38 percent drop in
