the energy department said tuesday it had 
suspended shipments of tritium to commercial customers from the oak 
ridge national laboratory in tennessee because of european customer 
complaints of short weights 
the department said headquarters staffers oak ridge employees 
and staff members of the nuclear regulatory commission whose 
export licenses govern overseas shipments are reviewing 
measurement and loading operations at oak ridge 
tritium a radioactive gas is a major component of many nuclear 
weapons but it also has commercial research and medical uses an 
atom of tritium is simply a hydrogen atom with two neutrons instead 
of none 
tritium is used in luminous signs such as aircraft exit signs 
and for runway markers in remote areas like alaska half of any 
original amount decays in 126 years 
annual commercial sales recently have averaged about 180 grams 
a little more than six ounces the total amount of discrepancies 
since mid1987 is about five grams about onesixth of an ounce 
the department said 
the department said it had no indication of risk to public 
health 
there were some pluses but it was mostly minuses that were 
complained about said department spokesman phil keif 
the departments production of tritium is currently shut down 
because of safety and management problems with the nuclear reactors 
used to produce it at the savannah river site in south carolina 
when the three reactors are running they can produce about 11 
kilograms of tritium per year about 24 pounds according to an 
estimate by the nuclear weapons databook published by an 
environmental group the natural resources defense council

britain has enough evidence to prosecute three 
suspected nazi war criminals a government inquiry said monday but 
a decision was postponed until parliament can debate the issue this 
fall 
the war crimes inquiry recommended british courts be given the 
power to hear cases of murder and manlaughter committed as war 
crimes in germany or germanoccupied territory during world war ii 
after examining 301 allegations against people living in 
britain it said there was sufficient evidence to prosecute four 
people although one has since died and another is in poor health 
another 78 cases warrant further investigation and attempts should 
be made to trace 46 others alleged to have fled to britain after 
the war it said 
in scotland a television program about alleged nazi war 
criminals living in britain was cut off monday night after lawyers 
acting for one of the men named in the program obtained a court 
injunction 
the program was stopped after 45 minutes of the hourlong 
documentary crimes of war had been shown directors of scottish 
television stv ordered the transmission be stopped because of the 
court action 
glasgowbased stv is part of britains commercial independent 
television network 
crimes of war was broadcast without interruption last year 
by stv and then throughout britain by the channel 4 station stv 
says the program helped prompt the government inquiry that resulted 
in mondays report 
the injunction was granted by judge lord prosser to lawyers 
acting for antanas gecas at a closeddoor hearing in the scottish 
capital of edinburgh 
gecas a 72yearold a retired engineer living in edinburgh has 
filed suit against the times of london over stories it has printed 
about him no date has been set for a hearing 
gecas denies allegations that he took part in the wartime 
killings of thousands of jews in nazi concentration camps and has 
said he only witnessed the slayingsa 
an stv spokesman released a statement saying on legal advice 
we took the program off the air as far as i know it is the first 
time a tv program in britain has ever been halted in transmission 
as the result of legal action 
home secretary douglas hurd said the house of commons and the 
unelected house of lords will debate the war crimes inquiry report 
this fall and in the light of views expressed the government 
will take a final decision 
he said there would be many practical problems in bringing 
criminal prosecutions decades later including the age and frailty 
of witnesses the difficulties of assembling evidence and of 
testifying when witnesses memories are more than 40 years old 
but quoting the report he said the crimes committed are so 
monstrous that they cannot be condoned to take no action would 
taint the uk with the slur of being a haven for war criminals 
the inquiry was set up in february 1988 after the government 
received a list of alleged war criminals said to be living in 
britain from the simon wiesenthal center the los angelesbased 
nazi hunters it was conducted by two prominent retired law 
officers sir thomas hetherington and william chalmers 
rabbi marvin hier dean of the simon wiesenthal center called 
the inquirys report an historic victory but said the 
government took the easy way out by not giving parliament 
specific proposals 
the inquiry deals with allegations of horrific killings on a 
very large scale crimes which would constitute violations of the 
internationally agreed laws and customs of war hurd said in the 
house of commons 
the allegations are not about actions committed in the heat of 
war they concern individuals allegedly holding quite senior 
positions in paramilitary units in territories occupied by german 
forces whose task was the systematic murder of civilians 
hurd ruled out extradition of suspects for trial in the soviet 
union where many of the atrocities took place the inquiry visited 
the soviet union to interview witnesses 
lawmaker roy hattersley of the opposition labor party welcomed 
the report but urged the government to follow the lead of other 
countries such as canada and australia to allow the prosecution 
of all war criminals not just nazis 
labor lawmaker peter archer said suspected war criminals might 
now decide to disappear for the second time 
hurd said no action would be taken to stop them from leaving 
britain adding such curtailment of peoples movements would be 
unacceptable and unfounded 
conservative lawmaker toby jessel said isnt the real point 
the sheer number of murders were not talking of one murder nor 
six nor 60 nor 600 nor 6000 nor 60000 nor 600000 but 6 
million murders including the murder of about a million children 
what is wrong with the idea of a little bit of justice for that

the planned early august launch of 
space shuttle columbia on a secret defense mission is likely to be 
delayed at least a day because of a problem with a fuel valve nasa 
officials report 
engineers were conducting tests today to determine if the valve 
was stuck or if they were receiving a false reading because of some 
other problem 
at the same time shuttle managers were beginning a twoday 
review of the readiness of all aspects of the mission they planned 
to set a firm launch date on wednesday 
columbia had been scheduled to lift off july 31 with a 
classified defense department payload but minor technical problems 
have forced delays nasa said last week that aug 7 would be the 
earliest possible launch date 
the valve problem was detected early monday following the brief 
launch pad test firing of all three of columbias auxiliary power 
units radio data indicated one of two hydrazine fuel valves 
leading to apu no 2 was stuck open when it should have been closed 
the apus provide power for moveable control surfaces such as 
wing flaps the speed brake and the rudder 
nasa at first said the faulty unit would be replaced a 
procedure that would delay the launch two or three days but 
officials said later they were not certain the valve was stuck open 
and they wanted to run some checks to determine what was wrong 
they said the tests will add a day to columbias launch 
processing schedule 
when an apu valve stuck open before last decembers launch of 
the shuttle atlantis the replacement and checkout of the new unit 
cost the launch team three days 
officials said they might be able to do the job in two days this 
time because of the experience gained then 
when columbia is launched its fiveman allmilitary crew is to 
deploy a pentagon payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance 
satellite

thomas root left the hospital ahead of 
schedule monday with questions still unanswered about his 800mile 
flight while apparently unconscious a gunshot wound to his abdomen 
and his personal dealings 
he asked us not to give details about his plans said linda 
hamlin spokeswoman for hollywoods memorial hospital where root 
was taken after the july 13 crash

his head and the planes sun visor moved while he was supposedly

investigation said fbi spokesman paul miller in miami as far 
as i know he has not been charged with anything and he is free to 
go wherever he wants

prime minister margaret thatcher has catapulted 
the most junior member of her cabinet john major into the 
prestigious office of foreign secretary making him a prime 
contender to succeed her 
the appointment monday of major the 46yearold son of a 
trapeze artist was the boldest move in mrs thatchers biggest 
government shakeup since she took office in 1979 
worried about her conservative party governments sliding 
popularity mrs thatcher named new appointees to more than half 
the 22 cabinet posts including defense 
the object of this shuffle was to improve the cutting edge of 
government said kenneth baker who was moved from education 
secretary to become chairman of the conservative party 
the previous chairman peter brooke who presided over the 
partys drubbing by socialists in elections for the european 
parliament last month was appointed to the cabinet as northern 
ireland secretary 
the job in the strifetorn province is largely removed from 
party politics on mainland britain 
mrs thatcher fired two key ministers transport secretary paul 
channon accused of bumbling bomb warnings in the aftermath of the 
pan am air disaster over scotland last dec 21 and of a mediocre 
performance during current transportation strikes and social 
security secretary john moore 
channon an heir to the vast guinness family brewing fortune and 
reputedly the richest man in the cabinet is also accused by 
critics of a lackluster performance during current strikes on 
british rail and the london subway 
two other cabinet members defense secretary george younger and 
trade and industry secretary lord young said they were resigning 
to resume business careers 
young was succeeded by northern ireland secretary tom king 
major who was raised in south londons rundown brixton district 
and left school at 16 is one of the few british foreign 
secretaries who has never been to college a selfmade man major 
did construction work for two years before making a career in 
banking 
his appointment underlined the transformation of the 
conservative party hierarchy once the preserve of the british 
upper classes since mrs thatcher a grocers daughter took over 
we now know without the need for guesswork who her chosen 
successor will be londons liberal guardian newspaper said 
tuesday 
mrs thatcher 63 is widely expected to retire some time after 
bidding for an unprecedented fourth successive term in the next 
election which must be held by mid1992 
the previous foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 62 was moved 
to the vacant post of deputy prime minister in what was widely seen 
as a demotion 
major and another relatively young appointee drafted into the 
cabinet for the first time christopher patten 45 the new 
environment secretary both entered parliament in may 1979 the 
election that brought mrs thatcher to power 
major is a firm supporter of mrs thatchers tightfisted 
economic policies while patten a noted speech writer comes from 
the conservatives liberal wing their rapid promotion highlighted 
a shuffle aimed mainly at improving the partys image 
major had been in the cabinet as the relatively obscure chief 
secretary to the treasury the no 2 financial post for just over 
two years before being appointed foreign secretary 
he said he planned to concentrate on the european economic 
community where mrs thatchers relations with other leaders are 
often prickly 
we are in europe i would like to see us take a lead in 
europe major said in a television interview 
the opposition labor party which since spring has held a strong 
lead of between 7 and 14 points over the conservatives in poll 
ratings dismissed the thatcher shakeup as cosmetic 
it is the policies that count and it is mrs thatchers policy 
and she is not going to change said roy hattersley deputy 
leader of the labor party 
mrs thatcher is beset by 83 percent inflation among the 
highest in an industrialized nation renewed labor union militancy 
the unpopularity of plans to sell off the water and electricity 
industries and the introduction of a controversial new property tax

rap performer chuck d of public enemy says 
rappers are king to some youths because they tell it like it is 
you gotta understand public enemy and rap music are 
dispatchers of information he said sunday at the indiana black 
expo festival 
were almost like headline news he said rap music is the 
invisible tv station that black america never had 
chuck d told an expo audience that the countrys social 
structure keeps blacks and whites apart and rap music is shocking 
the white community because rappers have become heroes to some 
white children 
organizers of the expo though said one reason for the session 
was that rap music is causing controversy within the black 
community 
prinses hemphill of the chicagobased coast to coast concerts 
said some investors are afraid of rap concerts because violence 
marred several performances 
concerns also were voiced about violent rap lyrics and explicit 
sexual imagery in rap videos but several people said adults should 
listen to the music to make their own judgments and some said its 
hard not to listen 
its like you got no choice because its coming right into 
your living room said parrish smith of rap group epmd

special investigators are trying to determine 
how so many people walked away from last weeks dc10 crash in 
iowa hoping to find ways for more people to survive airline 
crashes 
we want to know how injuries occurred how people got out 
well try to get people to remember everything they can ted 
lopatkiewicz of the national transportation safety board said 
monday 
members of the group led by ntsb investigators are 
interviewing hospitalized passengers in sioux city and will send 
questionnaires to other survivors lopatkiewicz said 
officials say 185 passengers and crew members survived when 
united airlines flight 232 en route from denver to philadelphia 
via chicago crashed wednesday while making an emergency landing in 
sioux city the ntsb has not determined the cause of the crash but 
reports say an engine explosion apparently knocked out flight 
steering mechanisms 
among issues to be studied by investigators is the fact that 
several infants were traveling at no charge in their parents arms 
a common practice on domestic flights and whether childrestraint 
seats should be required united said at least one infant was among 
the 111 dead 
the team lopatkiewicz said will try to determine what 
precautions were most effective in preventing injury and death when 
the disabled jetliner burst into flames during the emergency 
landing flipped over landed on its back and split apart in a 
cornfield near the airport 
the survival investigation also will cover crash and fire 
preparations on the ground lopatkiewicz said 
investigators have not determined how many passengers were 
children or infants or how many children were among the dead 
lopatkiewicz said a list compiled by the associated press shows 
that 24 children under age 10 including seven under 5 were among 
the survivors 
the ntsb recommended in 1983 that standards be adopted for 
infant seats on airliners in 1984 the federal aviation 
administration and the national highway traffic safety 
administration drew up standards for seats that can be used on 
airliners and cars but they are not required 
the association of flight attendants and some airline safety 
groups have pushed for childrestraint seats on airliners the 
procedure for emergencies is to have children without seats wrapped 
and padded and braced on the floor 
if childsafety seats were required infants who sit on laps and 
fly at no charge would need their own seats which could make 
family travel more expensive 
an unusually large number of children are flying on some 
domestic routes this summer in part because several airlines 
including united offered free tickets to children flying with 
adults on tuesdays and wednesdays

the chairman of a house panel investigating 
the federal housing scandal says he doesnt believe a former 
housing employee who contends her friendship with a top agency 
official brought her no favors 
washington attorney lynda murphy testified monday that she was 
not given special treatment by deborah gore dean a friend who was 
the top aide to samuel pierce secretary of the department of 
housing and urban development during the reagan administration 
rep thomas lantos dcalif asked whether he believed her 
testimony on that question said of course not 
ms murphy was one of two witnesses appearing as lantos 
subcommittee on employment and housing investigated allegations of 
mismanagement fraud and influencepeddling at hud during pierces 
eight years as secretary 
the other witness on monday republican national committeeman 
william taylor of florida defended his use of national party 
stationery for letters in which he lobbied hud officials for 
clients 
ms murphy is a washington attorney who since leaving hud in 
1982 has had extensive dealings with the agency she was criticized 
for hiring ms dean as a consultant after ms dean left the agency 
im beginning to feel there is a quid pro quo said rep 
christopher shays rconn 
but asked whether it would be fair to say her close friendship 
with ms dean helped her receive access to internal hud 
information ms murphy angrily replied i dont think thats a 
fair characterization 
ms murphy said she found nothing improper about her hiring ms 
dean she also defended her action in reading a draft copy of a hud 
document that affected a client ms murphy was representing before 
the agency 
ms murphy said ms dean asked a subordinate to show her the 
document a letter being prepared for pierces signature 
at the time ms murphy represented a client awaiting financing 
from drg funding corp a major lender in hud programs in the 
letter pierce criticized drg but lifted a requirement that it get 
advance hud approval of loans ms murphy later went to work for 
drg 
she said she was not surprised to be allowed access to the 
internal document and said such give and take was common 
between hud and representatives of major companies doing business 
with the agency 
during taylors testimony lantos asked whether the gop leader 
agreed that he should not have used rnc stationery to correspond 
with hud officials 
obviously i dont taylor said i found nothing wrong 
with letting people know who i am 
when shays said the panels goal was to rid washington of such 
influencepeddling taylor retorted good luck and added i 
didnt invent it 
i wish you were a democrat said shays a republican i am 
embarrassed you cashed in on your party 
taylor said he earned several hundred thousand dollars lobbying 
hud for a variety of clients and also got a 10 percent stake in one 
project paying less than 100 for an investment he estimated is 
worth more than 400000 
taylor former chairman of the florida republican party said he 
pleaded no contest and paid 5000 in court costs to end a 
conflictofinterest case after he represented both the city of 
jacksonville and the private developer concerning the same hud 
project 
also monday the new york newspaper newsday reported that 
washington hud officials gave away two lowincome housing projects 
in chicago for 1 each and allowed the projects to wind up in the 
hands of real estate developers who then received federal rent 
subsidies and tax credits worth millions of dollars 
the paper said in its long island editions the decision was made 
by former hud officials thomas demery and r hunter cushing over 
the objections of hud officials in chicago cushing has declined to 
testify before the house subcommittee citing his fifth amendment 
right against selfincrimination 
also it was disclosed that the justice department has decided 
not to prosecute demery in connection with his activities for a 
charity whose donors included many developers who did business with 
hud

the government should pay for care for 16 
million frail older americans who live at home but need help with 
such routine tasks as bathing and getting out of bed a private 
commission said today 
the commission on elderly people living alone said older 
americans with severe physical or mental limitations most of them 
women depend mainly on family or friends for help 
that can exact a heavy financial emotional and physical toll 
on the caregivers many of whom are themselves elderly of modest 
means and in poor health the report said 
providing limited amounts of governmentpaid help may help 
deter or delay nursing home placement by easing the burden on 
caregivers and sustaining their ability to continue providing 
assistance it said 
the commission established in 1985 by the commonwealth fund 
philanthropic foundation recommended that medicare be expanded to 
provide home care and adult daycare services for the most severely 
impaired elderly 
the expansion which would cost an estimated 68 billion if it 
were in place for 1989 would provide up to 25 hours of inhome 
care per week or two hours of adult day care could be substituted 
for each hour of home assistance 
these individuals with the help of family and friends are 
struggling to stay at home said dr robert butler chairman of 
the commission and the department of geriatrics and adult 
development at new yorks mount sinai medical center without 
help the alternative is often a nursing home 
the report help at home comes as congress looks for ways 
to rein in rapidly rising costs for government health assistance to 
the elderly and poor and as advocacy groups push for a national 
health care program to address needs such as financing for 
longterm care 
the commission said its proposal would represent only a modest 
benefit expansion yet could help to facilitate continued 
independent living and most significantly improve the quality of 
life for severely impaired elderly people who live alone 
under the proposal medicare would pay 80 percent of the costs 
for limited amounts of home care with medicaid picking up the 
balance for poor older americans 
the commission made up of experts on health policy and aging 
said more than 5 million of the 29 million elderly americans who 
live at home suffer from physical or mental limitations that 
restrict their independence 
the proposed homecare benefits would cover only the 16 million 
older people with the greatest physical and mental disabilities 
300000 of whom live alone and are in particular need of home care 
currently 70 percent of those who would be covered by the 
program rely solely on family and friends for help with wives and 
daughters giving more than half of the assistance 
these informal caregivers often face challenges of their own 
35 percent are 65 or older onethird are in fair or poor health 
and onethird have income of less than 125 percent of the poverty 
level the study said 
this is a story of poor women taking care of poor women said 
karen davis director of the commission and chairman of the 
department of health policy and management at the johns hopkins 
university school of hygiene and public health 
the emotional and financial toll on these caregivers can be 
enormous 
the home care these informal caregivers provide represents a 
timeconsuming and costly commitment the study found eighty 
percent of informal caregivers had been providing assistance seven 
days a week for at least a year 9 percent had to quit jobs because 
of the competing time demands 21 percent had reduced the number of 
hours they work and 19 had taken time off without pay

the federal government remains on track to 
post a reduction in the budget deficit in 1989 even though the 
usual june surplus was smaller than a year ago 
the treasury department said monday that revenues last month 
were up 92 percent from june 1988 to 10832 billion while 
spending rose 116 percent to 10053 billion 
that combined to produce a 779 billion surplus down 147 
percent from june 1988 
june usually provides a break in the monthly flow of red ink 
because corporations and individuals make quarterly tax payments in 
the month in may the government reported a deficit of 2547 
billion after a record 4057 billion surplus in april 
analysts attributed the smaller june surplus to a blip in 
spending caused by calendar fluke military pay veterans benefits 
and healthcare supplements usually are paid at the start of the 
month but because july 1 fell on a weekend those payments were 
shifted into june cutting what would have been a larger surplus 
even though last months surplus was smaller than last year the 
deficit for the first nine months of the fiscal year which began 
oct 1 was 1055 billion 116 percent lower than the first nine 
months of fiscal 1988 
if that pace continues through september the deficit for all of 
fiscal 1989 will be 1372 billion coming under the revised 
estimates of both the bush administration and the congressional 
budget office 
the administrations office of management and budget last week 
cut its 1989 deficit estimate from 1641 billion to 1483 billion 
because 1986 revisions to the tax laws are producing 
higherthanexpected revenues 
the cbo meanwhile predicts a deficit of 150 billion down 
from an earlier estimate of 159 billion 
both projections are in line with or a bit higher than those of 
private economists the deficit limit established for fiscal 1989 
under the grammrudman deficitreduction law is 136 billion 
this years deficit will probably come in the 145 billion to 
150 billion range said economist david jones of aubrey g 
lanston amp co inc a government securities dealer in new york 
but it wasnt due to an overly impressive deficit cutting 
effort by either congress or the administration but rather to the 
windfalls of the revenue act of 1986 
however economist samuel kahan of kleinwort benson government 
securities inc warned that the 1990 deficit could surge if the 
economy topples into a recession as some analysts expect 
a recession would cut tax revenues 
i would bet congress would turn around and start spending 
again as they have in past recessions kahan said 
the governments largest spending category last month was 
interest payments on the national debt the fastest growing 
spending category interest in june totaled 3762 billion and 
reached 19128 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal 
year that was up 131 percent from a year earlier 
other large spending categories were 
the military 2838 billion last month and 22134 billion so 
far this fiscal year up 38 percent from a year ago 
social security 2264 billion in june and 17016 billion so 
far in fiscal 1989 up 58 percent from a year earlier 
other programs in the department of health and human services 
1618 billion in june and 12852 billion so far in fiscal 1989 
up 82 percent from a year earlier

federal spending on price support operations 
to help corn farmers is adding up faster than agriculture 
department analysts estimated six months ago 
the increase stems from having more feed grains in us 
inventories than believed when the earlier spending projections 
were drawn up 
one of the effects was to reduce corn price projections from 
their earlier level that in turn raised the federal spending 
forecast for price support and income benefits 
despite the upward creep in costs for feed grains spending on 
some other commodities is much less than had been forecast earlier 
the net result is that total outlays in the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 are projected at less than 135 billion about 360 million 
below the level used last january 
the revised figures were in a midsession review report made 
available monday at the request of the associated press 
programs include payments to farmers for participating in annual 
crop programs in the case of major crops such as wheat corn and 
cotton the programs provide price supports and other benefits in 
return for taking land out of production 
but some other commodities also are covered including price 
support operations for soybeans peanuts tobacco honey sugar 
dairy and wool 
outlays for corn and other feed grains in 1989 were indicated in 
january at about 304 billion the review bumped the estimate up 
to 417 billion at the same time spending for wheat rice and 
upland cotton programs were reduced by more than 13 billion from 
the january forecast 
allowing for adjustments in other programs administered by the 
departments commodity credit corp total spending for the various 
agricultural commodities were reduced a net of 86 million to less 
than 703 billion for this fiscal year 
other ccc spending including 375 billion for aid to farmers 
who lost severely from the 1988 drought put the fiscal 1989 total 
to just under 135 billion compared with the january estimate of 
more than 138 billion 
looking at 1990 the report said total ccc spending could drop 
to just over 113 billion down 231 million from what was 
projected in january 
scott steele usda budget analyst said the boost in feed grains 
outlays from the level initially projected was a result of new 
quarterly grain inventory figures in january which showed more 
feed grain on hand than had been indicated previously 
it was this larger inventory that we did not take into account 
when we did the budget published by the outgoing reagan 
administration jan 9 and later adopted by president bushs people 
he said 
steele said the jan 9 projections were based on usda supply and 
demand readings in november the midsession review took into 
consideration the grain figures issued jan 13 
the supplyanddemand report issued jan 13 showed us crop 
estimates for 198889 were larger than anticipated with last 
years corn harvest put at 492 billion bushels an increase of 250 
million bushels from the november estimate 
one immediate result of the larger supply was a 
10centperbushel reduction in usdas 198889 corn price forecast 
looking at the 1990 fiscal year that begins oct 1 the report 
showed total ccc outlays at less than 114 billion down about 
231 million from what had been projected in january 
spending on feed grains in 198990 was indicated at nearly 707 
billion in 198990 up from the 556 billion projected in january 
declines from the january projections were shown for wheat rice 
and cotton 
comparatively total ccc spending both this year and next is 
expected to be at the lowest level since 1984 when programs cost 
less than 732 billion those ballooned to 177 billion in 1985 
and to a record 258 billion in 1986 before beginning their 
downtrend 
one reason for the decline in annual costs has been the 1985 
farm law which enabled usda to reduce price support levels and 
target price formulas for some of the major commodities

exercise stress management and driver 
education may help older people improve their road skills 
researchers say 
older drivers who participated in an experimental training 
program had increased upperbody flexibility felt less anxiety in 
stressful driving situations and improved their roadway observation 
habits west virginia university researchers said monday 
kenard mcpherson director of the west virginia traffic safety 
center and principal investigator for the study said further 
research could lead to a training program to keep older people on 
the road as long as they can safely operate 
mcpherson said additional work is needed to isolate the effects 
of exercise on driver performance but that the twoyear study 
carries encouraging implications about the beneficial effects 
of combined training in exercise stressreduction and driver 
education 
the automobile has become a symbol for both young and old of 
freedom independence and opportunity the study said 
drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in 
traffic accidents and when the number of miles driven is taken 
into account the two groups are almost equal the study said 
older drivers most common difficulties are in situations that 
require visual skills or rapid judgments many of those problems 
according to the study may stem from a general decline in the 
physical fitness status of adults as they age 
the researchers said their findings were encouraging in that 
the investigators were able to demonstrate that a closely 
supervised and monitored exercise program at home can improve older 
driver rangeofmotion reduce stress and improve these individual 
observing driving skills 
the aaa foundation for traffic safety which financed the study 
said the findings offer new hope to older drivers that they can 
minimize some physical effects of biological aging through exercise 
programs 
kenard said the drivers improved observation habits resulted in 
better scores for straightline backing parallel parking 
intersection scanning and checking to the sides when they wanted to 
change positions on the roadway 
however their actual vehicle handling skills for example 
keeping a vehicle in its lane or stopping at the proper point 
didnt improve he said 
the flexibility and stress management programs were not 
effective for the most part in improving the handling skills of 
older drivers the study said however these older drivers 
improved on the skill of observing after participating in a visual 
perception driver training program 
the study said the improved observation skills were rather 
significant given the importance of observing to driving tasks 
such as parking backing changing lanes driving straight and 
driving through blind intersections 
furthermore analyses indicate the skill of observing is 
an important factor differentiating good vs poor older drivers

congressional leaders and governors of seven 
coastal states say they share a commitment to developing federal 
and state laws that will protect coastal waters 
we may not all agree on the specific measures to respond to 
these problems but we all share a common commitment to work 
together to develop the best possible response to coastal pollution 
problems senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
said after mondays conference 
calling the closeddoor meeting an opportunity to develop a 
working partnership mitchell defended the lack of specifics in 
the agreement 
we think its very significant that we got started mitchell 
said at a news conference 
connecticut gov william a oneill agreed 
what were seeing here is a first he said this is a 
cohesive movement forward 
maryland gov william donald schaefer called the conference a 
historic meeting of governors and legislative leaders 
the governors and legislators signed a broad statement of 
principles that ranged from regional research and monitoring 
efforts to wetlands protections 
rep gerry e studds dmass chairman of the house merchant 
marine and fisheries subcommittee on the environment conceded that 
the agreement was not in itself that important but said it was 
significant that key governors and legislators were meeting to 
discuss coastal problems 
on financing the coastal protection agenda called only for 
creative ways to meet the funding needs of increased coastal 
protection but several democrats said the bush administration 
had to come through with more money 
we need more than a salute to a clean environment we need 
money said sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of the senate 
environment water protection subcommittee 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis the unsuccessful 1988 
democratic presidential nominee said these are going to be very 
very expensive projects all of them

dealing a setback to the bush administrations 
clean air bill the senate majority leader says it needs major 
surgery if the nation is to reduce auto pollution toxic chemicals 
and an acid rain component 
majority leader george j mitchell made clear monday he plans to 
revamp the measure telling reporters he has no intention of making 
sponsorship of failed clean air legislation his lifes work 
while mitchell chief sponsor of clean air measures for a 
decade was largely critical of the legislation the powerful 
chairman of the house energy and commerce committee gave bushs 
legislation a lukewarm endorsement 
at the first congressional hearing on the legislation energy 
and commerce chairman john d dingell dmich called the proposal 
the best vehicle for breaking a decadelong clean air 
stalemate he lashed out at detroitbashing critics who believe 
the bill is too soft on automakers 
dingell while praising the overall pollution reduction he said 
the bill would achieve warned he has reservations about several 
parts of the proposal and cautioned that the measure could have 
devastating effects on the auto industry and its workers 
environmental protection agency administrator william k reilly 
at the same hearing asked members of the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee to support the legislation 
reilly said the bill will make the 1990s the clean air 
decade and insisted it will force industry to rid the skies of 
pollution while taking into account the cost to business of 
reducing acid rain ozone smog and airborne toxic chemicals 
he said the legislation also will give industry incentives to 
cut pollution by giving business the flexibility to work out 
alternatives and trade credits for achieving more cleanup than 
required 
however mitchell said bush avoided virtually every tough 
choice in his legislation and gave too much discretion to the epa 
administrator to enforce the law 
mitchell said language to let automakers meet new antipollution 
requirements by averaging auto emissions represents a major retreat 
from current law averaging would allow some cars to exceed new 
antipollution standards while other vehicles would meet them with 
room to spare 
the averaging would cause confusion in emissions testing 
mitchell said because it would be nearly impossible to tell 
whether a particular car should pass 
mitchell called the bush bill especially weak on nitrogen 
oxides the second main ingredient of acid rain that harms lakes 
and streams 
incredibly the president proposes to permit increases in 
nitrogen oxide emissions mitchell said because bush would 
reduce nitrogen oxides by 2 million tons by the year 2000 while 
emissions of the substance are expected to grow by 3 million tons 
in the same period 
the senator however praised bushs plan to reduce sulfur 
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by 2000 compared with 1980 
levels sulfur dioxide is the major acid rain component 
mitchell said it was most disturbing that the cleanup of 
toxic chemicals under bushs plan would take into account the cost 
to industry when protecting americans health 
he attacked the socalled unreasonable risk health standard 
in which economists would perform a costbenefit analysis 
estimating how much a human life is worth and how many must be at 
risk before additional control of toxic air pollutants is 
warranted 
dingell said he had several other reservations about the bill 
including 
provisions that fail to give states credit for past reductions 
of sulfur dioxide 
the failure to protect between 20000 and 50000 jobs in the 
soft coal and related industries which could result from new 
requirements on utilities 
a cap on sulfur dioxide emissions after the year 2000 which he 
said could tilt in favor of some fuel to the detriment of coal

the bush administration calls the new mexican 
debt relief package a breakthrough accord that will make it easier 
to reach debt reduction plans for other third world countries 
but some members of congress and private bankers remain 
skeptical about how fast and how much debt relief will flow to 
mexico because of the arrangement 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who provided a final push 
over the weekend to get a mexican deal completed hailed the 
package monday as a fantastic change in circumstances for the 
povertystricken country 
he said the proposal if fully implemented will cut mexicos 
annual interest payments by 15 billion down about onethird from 
the 5 billion to 54 billion the country is paying on its 
commercial bank debt of 54 billion 
in addition brady estimated that over four years the amount of 
mexicos outstanding debt will be reduced by 10 billion to 12 
billion from where it would have been without the agreement 
in a briefing for reporters brady expressed hope that 
agreements will be reached in coming months with other countries 
he specifically mentioned venezuela the philippines and costa rica 
as likely candidates 
those deals should move more swiftly because a lot of the pick 
and shovel work was accomplished with the initial mexican 
transaction he said 
but brady conceded that even with the mexican plan it could be 
the end of the year before benefits begin flowing to the country 
that is because the relief will depend on individual decisions 
being made by more than 500 commercial banks that hold mexicos 
loans 
to keep the country economically afloat until then brady said 
the united states and other major industrial countries are willing 
to put up around 15 billion in shortterm financing 
mexico was seen as a key test case for the administrations debt 
reduction effort unveiled by brady on march 10 the administration 
has made debt reduction a key component of its foreign policy 
believing that the only way to ensure the survival of emerging 
democracies especially in latin america is to ease the crushing 
13 trillion third world debt burden 
in the case of mexico the debt reduction package provides banks 
with three options 
banks can cut 35 percent off the value of the current loans by 
exchanging the old debt for bonds carrying guarantees that banks 
will receive payment on the reduced debt the guarantees would come 
from the 151nation international monetary fund and its sister 
organization the world bank 
banks can agree to cut interest rates to 625 percent down 
from about 10 percent with the interest payments also guaranteed 
by the imf and world bank 
banks can agree to provide new loans until now this has been 
the only approach to the debt problem with banks simply agreeing to 
funnel more money to a debtor country funds that basically went to 
pay interest payments on the old debt 
rep charles schumer dny said he is concerned that too many 
banks will opt for simply supplying new loans and this will result 
in a meager writedown of mexicos old debt 
a lot of the banks without the necessary carrots or sticks 
are going to stick with the familiar approach of supplying new 
money to pay old debt schumer said 
rep john lafalce dny said the mexican agreement does not 
represent any longlasting breakthrough in mexicos debt 
situation but he said it will help the country through its 
immediate cashflow problems 
for their part the commercial banks said it is too soon to say 
how much debt relief they will give mexico because they have not 
yet had time to explore the full plan 
at the moment were exploring our options said fraser 
seitel a spokesman for chase manhattan corp were looking at 
the entire third world debt package

a generic medication used to control high 
blood pressure is being recalled because samples were 
misrepresented in a government inspection 
par pharmaceutical inc of spring valley ny also is 
suspending the sale of two other drugs pending an investigation 
the action marks the second time this summer a drug company has 
acknowledged marketing a formulation of a product that was 
different from that approved by the food and drug administration 
par pharmaceutical pulled its generic version of the 
antihypertensive drug maxzide off the market monday after telling 
the fda that an employee switched a sample of the drug requested by 
the fda with a sample from another batch of the drug 
the company also said it was investigating a possible 
misrepresentation involving its generic orphengasic forte a muscle 
relaxant and is considering an fda request that it be recalled 
par has suspended sales of the generic muscle relaxant as well 
as those of its generic valproic acid an anticonvulsant which is 
being investigated 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee and rep thomas bliley 
rva ranking republican on the panel said the disclosure shows 
that fdas generic drug regulation is dangerously lax 
the problem is we can no longer be reasonably confident that 
the fda is able to detect the entry of unsafe or inefficacious 
generic drugs into the nations pharmacies said dingell whose 
panel has been investigating the agencys generic drug division 
par said it had no reason to believe that there are any 
adverse health or safety implications involved in any of the 
three drugs its reviewing and has promised to cooperate with the 
fda 
fda spokesman bill grigg said the agency had no concerns about 
safety of any of the three par drugs but we are looking into 
whether the effectiveness of any of these medications was reduced 
par and one of the companys founders ashok patel pleaded 
guilty in us district court in baltimore last week to paying 
illegal gratuities to fda employees 
the charges are unrelated to the misrepresentation of the 
companys triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide which is its generic 
version of maxzide said barbara manners par vice president and 
general counsel 
vitarine pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens ny said last 
month that its employees had substituted samples of fdaapproved 
dyazide for its own generic version of the drug to win government 
approval for its product 
par said in a statement that certain product samples furnished 
to an fda inspector were intentionally drawn from a production 
batch other than that represented to the inspector 
par said it would convene a panel of outside consultants to 
review the companys research and development activities and 
recordkeeping systems the consultants will report to a special 
committee of the companys board of directors par said 
additionally par said that because of the urgency of the 
investigations of these matters it has postponed its annual 
shareholders meeting which had been scheduled for friday

prosecutors in the irancontra scandal say the 
cia shouldnt invoke concerns over national security to block the 
trial of one of the agencys former station chiefs 
a federal appeals court judge granted the justice departments 
request monday to delay the trial of joseph fernandez charged with 
lying to investigators about his assistance to oliver norths 
contra network 
fernandez says that to defend himself he must identify the 
locations of three cia stations and facilities in latin america and 
detail three of the agencys highly sensitive programs in costa 
rica 
the justice department at the cias request wants to prevent 
the disclosures 
us district judge claude hilton presiding over the case in 
alexandria va rejected government proposals to substitute 
numbers for the names of cia stations and to abandon part of one 
charge against fernandez in exchange for dropping references to the 
programs fernandezs trial was to have begun monday 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals will decide whether to 
allow the justice department to formally intervene and whether to 
reverse hiltons rulings 
the cia is trying to protect a fictional secret by objecting 
to the release of the classified information independent counsel 
lawrence walsh said in a letter to the justice department 
the fernandez case he said will not be able to be tried if the 
department blocks disclosure of the names of cia stations and the 
three cia costa rican programs 
the classified information procedures act gives attorney general 
dick thornburgh the authority to file an affidavit in court 
prohibiting the disclosure of classified information if a judge 
deems the material vital the criminal charges can be dismissed 
in going to the appeals court the justice department was 
avoiding filing the potentially casekilling affidavit 
fernandez faces two counts of obstruction and two counts of 
making false statements in his responses to the cia inspector 
generals office and the tower commission in 1987

energy secretary james watkins is unhappy that 
the first of the governments three tritiumproducing nuclear 
reactors wont be restarted until september 1990 long after 
expected 
department spokesman phil keif said monday that watkins has 
written the civilian contractor westinghouse corp saying he 
wasnt very happy about such a long period before production 
resumes 
the three reactors at the savannah river site in south carolina 
have been shut for more than a year because of safety and 
management concerns during the shutdown the previous contractor 
du pont corp withdrew and the government hired westinghouse 
the reactors are the sole source of tritium a shortlived 
radioactive gas essential for many nuclear weapons because tritium 
decays to inert helium the tritium charge must be renewed from 
time to time 
defense officials have said some weapons might have to be 
cannibalized to keep other weapons in service if tritium production 
isnt restarted soon 
asked if the september 1990 date was a surprise keif said i 
think so 
westinghouse sent this back in its restart plan the secretary 
wrote back and said he wasnt very happy with that and wed have 
to get together again to see what could be done keif said 
keif said he didnt know if any new problems were discovered at 
the reactors that would require such a delay 
when the reactors were shut down in spring 1988 officials 
expected to restart at least one that summer the date has been 
pushed back several times since then

a 60 million examination of environmental 
problems at the governments nuclear weapons plants may not be 
reliable the energy departments inspector general reports 
inspector general john c layton whose staff examined about 
half of the preliminary reports prepared by environmental survey 
teams concluded the reports lacked organized detailed supporting 
documents 
the energy department disagreed saying the documents criticized 
by the inspector general werent intended to be reference materials 
the report published monday said the surveys were backed up with 
log books of personal notes too skimpy to jog the memories of the 
notetakers 
the notes were neither indexed nor organized in a way that 
would allow anyone to trace facts or conclusions in the reports 
back to the source the inspector generals office wrote team 
members acknowledged that it would be difficult and timeconsuming 
to locate information in the backup documents 
the notes generally were not recorded in complete sentences 
and were not detailed enough to function as a memory aid even to 
team members who may be involved in hundreds of findings at dozens 
of locations the report said 
the 60 million inventory began under the reagan administration 
in a memo to energy secretary james watkins the inspector 
general said officials cannot be assured that the 60 million 
effort provides a sound basis for prioritizing environmental 
problems 
layton said some contamination may not be adequately identified 
and critical projects may end up in the wrong place on the cleanup 
priority list and lose limited funding 
the energy department in its formal response to the report 
said the preliminary reports produced by the field staff were sent 
to the various plants where they were not found to be 
deficient 
the department said the inspector general extrapolated beyond 
what is reasonable 
layton told a house energy and commerce subcommittee last week 
the surveys were designed to identify environmental problems and 
rank them according to priority but the shortcomings undermine 
the credibility of the process and call into question the 
usefulness of the surveys 
the details of the report were withheld until monday

hard hats are out and bathing suits 
in at an old steel plant where a giant water park sits like an 
oasis in an industrial wasteland 
built on the railroad yards of usx corps former homestead 
works the 20acre park presents a bright new image for residents 
accustomed to staring at fiery smokestacks coal trains and mile 
after mile of steel mills 
the park with 15 water slides kiddie pool sandy beach and 
wooden boardwalk is the most striking effort to revitalize the 
hardhit steel belt along the monongahela river 
those of us who live around here cant believe its such a 
pretty place you feel like youre far away when youre so close to 
home said beverly hess 46 relaxing recently with friends under 
a beach umbrella 
you couldnt imagine it being picturesque down here because it 
was such an eyesore and to think our parents worked here said 
mrs hess who lives a few blocks from the park 
two years ago during an international conference on redesigning 
urban areas a group of planners led by britains prince charles 
swarmed over the monongahela valley and came up with a variety of 
ideas for revitalizing the area 
some ideas like openair markets parks and marinas seemed a 
bit farfetched to residents and more befitting sophisticated 
cities than tough mill towns 
but even the most imaginative proposals didnt envision a water 
park on the banks of the oncepolluted monongahela six miles 
southeast of downtown pittsburgh 
its an emotional shot of adrenalin its the first positive 
thing thats happened in west homestead since the mill closed 
three years ago said ann hughes media director for the park 
the valley which extends for about 30 miles southeast of 
pittsburgh has largely missed out on the renaissance taking place 
in the city and its suburbs during the past century its 
oneindustry towns grew up around the mammoth steel mills lining 
the river and when steel plummeted earlier in the decade so did 
the communities dependent on them 
the water park shows little evidence of manufacturing tall 
poplars and willows shadow a spidery network of slides tugboats 
churn the wide monongahela and a dense treecovered hillside 
dominates the opposite riverbank 
but the fantasy ends with the view from the top of the 
85foothigh slide sprawling for miles outside the park walls are 
the wreckage of aged industry dark cavernous buildings of the 
former mesta machine co slagcovered lots and long coal trains 
headed to power plants 
over the past few years local government and entrepreneurs have 
begun developing some of the sites into industrial parks hightech 
centers and now even water parks like sandcastle 
its an image changer said joseph m hohman director of 
development for allegheny county and cochairman of the mon valley 
commission which coordinates revitalization projects in the 
valley sandcastle certainly has changed peoples outlook of what 
the future of the valley can be 
kennywood park owner of sandcastle and two amusement parks in 
western pennsylvania spent 7 million to build the park which 
opened last week 
the park employs 135 people a pittance compared with the 15000 
who once toiled at the centuryold homestead works and the 4000 
who labored at mesta 
tom croft executive director of the steel valley authority 
which is trying to rebuild industry in the valley said ventures 
like sandcastle help diversify the economy but jobs in recreation 
he said are no match for those in manufacturing 
if youre coming from the perspective that the area should 
become a bedroom community of pittsburgh then you might draw the 
conclusion that we could make these 25 miles of riverfront into 
parks he said 
if you have families to raise or if you are a borough official 
of one of these towns in bankruptcy though then you need to 
replace some of the thousands of jobs that have been lost with as 
many familywage jobs as possible

the government today sought to minimize the impact 
of its political troubles on foreign relations with assurances that 
planned diplomatic contacts will go ahead including the defense 
chiefs visit to washington 
but some analysts warned of trouble in foreign economic affairs 
and said the growing influence of opposition parties could make 
japans trade policy more protectionist 
the governing liberal democrats hard loss in parliamentary 
elections followed by prime minister sousuke uno decision to 
resign after less than two months in office could seriously erode 
the partys ability to set policy 
unos decision monday means his cabinet also will resign but 
not until the liberal democrats find a new leader which is 
expected to take several weeks as no obvious candidate was in sight 
at a cabinet meeting this morning uno said japan holds an 
important position in global affairs and continuity should be 
maintained to the maximum extent a foreign ministry official 
said 
foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka will travel to paris this 
weekend for international talks on the cambodia issue and defense 
agency chief taku yamasaki will go ahead with a scheduled trip to 
washington in early august said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
sundays election cost the liberal democrats their majority in 
parliaments upper house the first time in the partys 34 years 
that it lost control of a legislative chamber and gave a strong 
boost to the opposition socialist party 
the socialists are more protectionist on trade issues than the 
liberal democrats and oppose the security treaty under which some 
64000 us troops are based in japan 
yamasaki said the liberal democrats security policy will be 
unshakable and he warned that the opposition would change defense 
policy if it came to power in that respect we will maintain 
political power with a sense of great responsibility yamasaki 
told reporters after the cabinet meeting 
the defense agency chief leaves for washington aug 7 for a 
weeklong visit that includes talks with defense secretary dick 
cheney on such matters as the two countries joint development of a 
new jet fighter for japan called the fsx 
us critics of the fsx deal have called it a giveaway of us 
technology but yamasaki says it is a defense matter rather than an 
economic issue 
both the liberal democrats and the opposition were holding 
separate meetings today to chart their political moves 
the governing party is undecided on how to pick a new leader 
and the opposition parties will have to overcome their policy 
differences to mount a joint assault on the liberal democrats in 
parliament 
while the oppositions key issue against the government is 
likely to be an unpopular new sales tax some analysts warned that 
japan could become more protectionist because the socialists and 
other opposition parties won votes from farmers disgruntled by the 
liberal democrats moves to open japan to more agricultural imports 
its ironic that the diet parliament will become more 
protectionist political science professor takashi inoguchi of 
tokyo university said at a foreign correspondents lunch 
a leftward shift in national politics tends to make japan more 
nationalistic in trade matters inoguchi said 
princeton university political science professor kent calder 
said in the short run the japanese government will become more 
hesitant and reactive in its foreign policies including foreign 
economic policies 
calder said washington will find it more difficult to make 
progress in coming negotiations on japans distribution system 
because small businessmen are an important constituency of the 
liberal democrats 
the united states complains that japans complex system of 
multiple middlemen amounts to a trade barrier because it is hard 
for foreign goods to gain entry to the retail market 
the election result showed the impact of foreign pressures on 
domestic politics calder said 
as examples he cited us and other foreign demands for more 
access to japanese farm markets which the liberal democratic 
government gradually granted only to see its candidates defeated in 
formerly safe farming districts 
the demands of the international system can have adverse 
consequences domestically calder said 
calder noted that the election marked the first big defeat for 
the probusiness liberal democrats since japan emerged as a 
financial superpower 
the liberal democrats retain control of the more powerful lower 
house of parliament and the election defeat did not have any 
significant effect on currency or stock markets 
calder indicated this was an area that bore further watching in 
the future because of the importance of japan in globalized markets 
and as a massive lender

the national endowment for the arts would be

the panel monday also endorsed a houseapproved proposal to trim 
the endowments 1714 million budget next year by 45000 the 
exact amount the agency gave for the controversial shows by 
photographers robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano 
the endowment is an independent federal agency that awards 169

vital

house speaker thomas s foley says president 
bushs plan to cut the capital gains tax rate is a misguided and 
unfortunate proposal that would benefit the rich and hurt efforts 
to cut the deficit 
in a speech to the national press club on monday foley said 
more than a third of the total tax break would go to people earning 
more than 1 million a year 
the proposal of the president to cut the rate on capital gains 
is i think misguided and unfortunate and would open the door to 
tax shelters that seriously eroded public confidence in the tax 
system the washington democrat said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters it is 
definitely not a foregone conclusion that we are going to win this 
we are working on it very hard we think capital gains are 
important but theres still a lot of discussions to take place 
over the next few days 
as a result of the 1986 tax overhaul capital gains are taxed at 
the same rates as other income 15 percent 28 percent and 33 
percent bush campaigned on a promise of a 15 percent rate for all 
capital gains regardless of a taxpayers total income

the american diplomat suspected of spying 
for the soviets tried to cut a higher profile than his post 
warranted but was wellconnected and worked hard according to a 
former us ambassador to austria 
felix s bloch who is in the united states and under fbi 
investigation was known as a workaholic when he worked at the 
us embassy in vienna said the former ambassador helene von damm 
mrs von damm promoted bloch then an economic expert at the 
embassy its deputy chief of mission when she took over as 
ambassador in 1983 she resigned in june 1985 
in an interview shown monday on austrian public television mrs 
von damm was asked about bloch a fellow austrian native 
bloch was one of six applicants for the position of deputy 
chief and for me he was the best qualified she said 
he was already very wellconnected he was established people 
respected him and in washington he was known as a man who was very 
ambitious and hardworking a kind of workaholic and i thought he 
actually suits me quite well she said 
but mrs von damm also said she had some trouble with bloch 
i was very satisfied with him to begin with she said i 
even helped him get a special distinction but as time went by he 
tried time and again to enhance his profile in public and i had to 
rein him in again and again 
i wasnt terribly harried by this at the time it was a 
problem i could cope with no one is perfect and other than that 
he did very well 
she said that only at the time when she sent her letter of 
resignation to washington there were signs that he bloch was 
not 100 percent loyal to me she also said she advised ronald 
lauder who succeeded her as the us ambassador in vienna to look 
for someone to replace bloch 
exambassador lauder now campaigning for mayor in new york 
city said bloch was transferred to washington from vienna because 
of insubordination 
mrs von damm said that as deputy chief of mission bloch had the 
same access to secret documents and information as the ambassador 
because he had the same top clearance 
in reply to a question she said that bloch knew the resident 
cia representatives in vienna 
if bloch was a spy it would be a great damage for the united 
states she added she spoke in german with an occasional english 
phrase 
mrs von damm resigned as ambassador following criticism of her 
marriage to vienna hotel owner peter guertler it was her fourth 
marriage and it also ended in divorce

solidarity activist adam michnik 
has used the official passport afforded him after he won a seat in 
polands parliament to see alexander dubcek leader of the crushed 
prague spring uprising 
michnik and two other members of the the polish free trade union 
movement met with dubceck for three hours monday at the former 
communist party leaders home in bratislava said czechoslovak 
activist petr uhl said 
dubcek and the solidarity activists agreed that the sovietled 
1968 invasion that crushed dubceks liberal reforms was an 
unacceptable and illegal act uhl said he was reached by 
telephone from vienna 
dubcek was ousted in april 1969 and expelled from the party in 
june 1970 
czechoslovak police watched the poles accompanied by czech 
human rights activist jan urban arrive at dubceks home but did 
not interfere said uhl 
he said police also filmed the poles and czechoslovaks arrive at 
urbans prague home on saturday for a meeting of activists 
the meeting centered on the forthcoming 21st anniversary of the 
1968 invasion which is expected to be the focus of more 
antigovernment protests in czechoslovakia 
uhl said the solidarity activists spent sunday night at the 
country home of dissident playwright vaclav havel czechoslovakias 
most prominent human rights campaigner 
havel was jailed for eight months earlier this year but released 
on parole after unprecedented protests at home and abroad 
on saturday michnik and the other solidarity visitors met 
cardinal frantisek tomasek 90yearold head of czechoslovakias 
beleaguered roman catholic church 
michnik himself a former political prisoner has also made use 
of his new official passport to travel to the soviet union 
uhl said michnik had informed dubcek about his talks in moscow 
and his impressions of recent soviet reforms which the former 
czechoslovak leader has praised in public statements since 1987 
roundtheclock surveillance of dubcek was lifted that year when 
mikhail s gorbachev visited czechoslovakia and dubcek was 
permitted last fall to go to italy to receive an honorary degree 
there he made a series of statements criticizing pragues 
current communist leaders he has not been allowed to travel abroad 
since

jubilant shrimpers pointed their boats 
toward the open gulf after a weekend of protests and blockades 
prompted the government to suspend regulations requiring 
turtlesaving devices in their nets 
thank god were going fishing and making a living said tee 
john mialjevich a louisiana shrimper and president of concerned 
shrimpers of america which organized many of the protests 
us commerce secretary robert mosbacher decided monday to 
suspend indefinitely a rule that shrimpers use devices to protect 
the endangered kemps ridley turtle 
environmentalists denounced the suspension and one group 
promised to organize a national boycott of shrimp 
hundreds of shrimpers in galveston meanwhile broke into cheers 
when they heard about mosbachers decision 
this is a lot more than we thought we would get said 
richard santini of galveston who estimated he lost 6000 to 
7000 during the weekends blockade of the houston ship channel 
we can make a living now 
the shrimpers gathered outside a galveston meeting between 
mialjevich and gray castle a commerce department deputy 
undersecretary while mosbacher met in washington with congressmen 
from gulf states 
mialjevich boarded a motorized cart with castle and shouted to 
the throng lets stay together many shrimpers had threatened 
another blockade if their demands were not met 
castle said mosbacher was concerned about another blockade but 
added officials also worried about shrimpers pocketbooks 
its true that anytime you get 250 shrimp boats blockading a 
harbor youve potential for problem castle said but youre 
talking about peoples livelihoods 
i think if any of us was in the same position wed react in 
the same way 
mosbacher said enforcement of the turtle excluder regulations 
would be suspended indefinitely 
beginning in 45 days shrimpers will have to pull their nets 
from the water every 90 minutes to free turtles but will not have 
to use the turtle excluders that is the amount of time turtles can 
survive underwater 
authorities will issue warnings to shrimpers caught not pulling 
their nets after 90 minutes next year the regulations will be 
reevaluated 
proponents of the endangered turtles were bitter they had 
claimed the turtle excluder devices would help save the turtles 
from extinction 
the radical action of the secretary of commerce has convinced 
us that we need to take some radical action said mike weber 
vice president of programs for the center for marine conservation 
webers group planned to organize a nationwide shrimp boycott 
and to seek a temporary restraining order against mosbachers 
decision 
i think you may find that there are far more people out here 
that care about upholding the endangered species law than there are 
shrimpers said jane scheidler spokeswoman for help endangered 
animalsridley turtles and presidentelect of the houston audubon 
society 
previous studies show 11000 sea turtles die in shrimp nets 
every year including 3000 in the gulf of mexico shrimpers 
disclaim responsibility for the deaths 
the excluders are like trap doors allowing turtles to escape the 
nets shrimpers complain the contraptions let shrimp out too 
reducing harvests as much as 35 percent they also say the devices 
are bulky and dangerous to operate 
the law requiring excluders went into effect may 1 mosbachers 
call for enforcement of the law last week led to the protests 
about 200 shrimp boats had crowded the deepwater houston 
channel saturday and about 300 shrimpers jammed port aransas 
gateway to the port of corpus christi 
similar blockades were staged at other gulf of mexico ports 
along the texas and louisiana coasts but the shrimpers disbanded 
sunday after federal officials promised to hear their complaints 
gunfire was reported in texas and louisiana during the blockades 
and four shrimpers were arrested in texas there were no injuries 
authorities said 
ship traffic blocked in several ports saturday was normal 
monday coast guard officials said

hundreds of japanese tourists are 
visiting iran the first foreigners to take package tour vacations 
in the country since the 1979 islamic revolution irans official 
news agency reported today 
but the islamic republic news agency quoted the transport 
industry magazine sanat hamlo naql as saying formalities at 
tehrans mehrabad airport are enough to ruin the whole trip 
the monthly magazine noted most of the japanese questioned 
said that just because of the difficulties of entering and exiting 
mehrabad they are not willing to come to iran ever again 
rigorous security immigration and customs controls at mehrebad 
in and out involve lengthy waits sometimes lasting several hours 
at an airport not renowned for its services 
irna quoted mehdi hashemi head of the staterun foundation for 
the disableds hotel and travel agencies division as saying we 
have problems at the airport and were trying to solve them 
these problems show that the officials in charge do not have 
the right picture of a tourist he said 
tourism is considered very important even to countries which 
do not have much need for foreign exchange but for iran the 
attraction of tourists is obviously more important hashemi noted 
the magazine said as many as 500 japanese in groups of a few 
dozen have visited iran since may 
since the august ceasefire in the 8year war with iraq iran 
has been seeking to redevelop a oncethriving tourist industry that 
collapsed during the 1979 islamic revolution 
the irna report monitored in nicosia made no mention of 
tourists other than japanese visiting iran 
but tehran has been boosting relations with third world 
countries and the soviet bloc while its relations with the west 
remain icy 
irna said the japanese spend 3500 in hard currency for a 
10day visit the price includes a 2000 roundtrip ticket from 
tokyo with iran air irans national carrier 
the package tours organized by the disabled foundations 
tourism division takes the visitors to historical sites in tehran 
as well as the provincial cities of shiraz isfahan hamadan and 
bakhtaran 
iran today is not wellexperienced in tourism but with the 
expansion of this operation theres hope for improvement said 
nasser moradi a manager of the tourist organization

state officials angrily reacted to exxons 
plan to pull all its oil spill cleanup forces out of alaska by 
midseptember saying crews should stay until the area is clean 
meanwhile the oil giant indicated the cost of cleaning up the 
nations largest oil spill would total about 125 billion and was 
a major factor behind a plunge in its second quarter earnings 
in an internal memo released monday a top company official said 
the sept 15 pullout date was not negotiable 
its not enough to declare victory and go home gov steve 
cowper said monday virtually from the beginning exxon promised 
alaskans that the company would stay until the job was done i 
expect them to fulfill that promise 
but exxon spokesman henry beathard said there was nothing new in 
the memo 
weve been saying all along we would operate until about sept 
15 when we have to shut down because of the weather he said 
none of that has changed 
otto harrison exxons general manager in valdez said in a memo 
to company officials dated july 19 that no winter cleanup 
operations will be conducted because of safety and operational 
reasons and the companys only commitment for next spring is to 
survey the shorelines 
these are not negotiable points he wrote in the memo a 
copy of which was provided to the associated press 
our discussions with federal or state agencies is for the 
purpose of keeping them informed and is not requesting approval 
harrison wrote 
the memo was dated the day before exxon president bill stevens 
testified before a senate subcommittee and reluctantly committed 
the company to resuming operations next year if more work needs to 
be done 
a spokesman for interior secretary manuel lujan said exxons 
obligation to clean up the mess does not end in september 
the secretary has stated all along that exxon is fully liable 
and responsible for that accident and they have an obligation to 
ensure full mitigation of damages and to restore prince william 
sound back to its original splendor spokesman steve goldstein 
said 
steve provant onscene oil spill coordinator for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation said his agency wants 
exxon to leave a contingency force behind to deal with oil that may 
wash off beaches and cause problems during the winter 
he also said it might be possible for exxon crews to work until 
oct 1 provant said this winter the state plans to monitor 
beaches map the damage test waters and fly over the area 
an army of 11000 people 1000 vessels and more than 70 
aircraft has been trying to clean beaches stained after the exxon 
valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 and spilled about 11 million 
gallons of crude 
in releasing its earnings exxon said a provision for spill 
costs reduced its net income by 850 million in the second quarter 
the company said the provision includes 600 million already 
spent on the cleanup plus estimated future outlays but does not 
include the cost of any lawsuits in addition the company said 
insurance coverage of more than 400 million would go toward the 
cleanup 
exxon reported an 87 percent drop in net income to 160 million 
from 12 billion a year earlier 
cowper said he understood exxons need to have a plan for 
scaling back as winter approaches but he said demobilization 
does not mean disappearance 
surveys by the state and the coast guard indicate only about 
onethird of the cleanup work either has been completed or is in 
progress the governor said 
he said some of the beaches already treated have been fouled 
again by significant amounts of oil 
but beathard said we believe six months of winter storms and 
tidal action will remove most if not all of whats remaining 
he said 
beathard said a shoreline assessment would be undertaken in the 
spring

albert johnston jr had tears in his eyes as 
he watched his familys story once again on the big screen 40 
years after his chance remark to a famous filmmaker resulted in a 
movie about race 
johnston sat with his mother thyra and a crowd of nearly 700 
people monday night to watch lost boundaries and remember the 
man who inspired it his father dr albert johnston 
were all here because a brave man and a patriotic man 
tried to join a segregated navy said keene state college film 
professor lawrence benaquist who organized the reunion on the 40th 
anniversary of the films opening in keene 
the fairskinned johnstons passed for white in gorham and keene 
in the 1930s and 40s so johnston could find work as a doctor 
they kept the secret even from their children until 1941 when 
johnston was refused a navy commission when naval investigators 
found he belonged to a black fraternity in college and had black 
ancestry 
several years later albert jr and other university of new 
hampshire students visited louis de rochemont producer of the 
march of time documentary films at his newington home to 
encourage fairer treatment of minorities in films 
on his way out albert jr mentioned the revelation that was to 
enthrall de rochemont the two subsequently convinced the johnstons 
to let the filmmaker dramatize their story 
we never had any bad repercussions said the 88yearold 
mrs johnston now of kaneohe hawaii the story has not hurt us 
at all 
the film won the 1949 cannes film festival award for best script 
and was revolutionary for its time treating its subject in a bold 
documentarylike fashion 
all of us had a certain real conviction about the theme of the 
picture and the content of the picture and i didnt hesitate 
said mel ferrer who made his screen debut in the film portraying 
dr johnstons character 
at keene state colleges arts center ferrer and other members 
of the cast and crew recalled the difficulties caused by the films 
touchy topic 
de rochemont was under contract to mgm at the time he decided to 
make lost boundaries but the major studio balked at the idea 
after initial enthusiasm about the project associate producer 
borden mace said 
de rochemont scraped together the money even mortgaging his 
house to make the film independently mace explained but he said 
a desire for authenticity not financial concerns prompted the 
producer to use unknowns and shoot on location in new hampshire and 
maine 
the film was slightly fictionalized with the names of people 
and places altered 
at first reluctant to see their lives on the screen the family 
was and still is pleased with the film mrs johnston said she 
wished the film were more widely known 
i think it would help the younger people to know what it was 
like then she said

producer joseph papp reaffirmed his decision to 
cancel an appearance by a palestinian theater company but said he 
hoped to present it along with other productions dealing with the 
middle east within a year 
papp producer of the new york shakespeare festival decided 
last month to withdraw an offer to the elhakawati palestinian 
theater company of jerusalem because of concern about the reactions 
of jewish theatergoers 
i live with my decision and my sensibilities particularly 
those that relate to national and religious groups living in new 
york where my plays are presented papp said at a news conference 
monday if there had been an overwhelmingly large arabic 
theatergoing population living here i would be just as sensitive 
to their beliefs and concerns as i am to jews 
the sixperson company was to have performed the story of 
kufur shamma at the public theater last week the play tells of a 
40year search by a palestinian man for residents of his village 
that was decimated by the 1948 arabisraeli war 
papp met monday with members of the americanarab relations 
committee members of the committee said the meeting was cordial 
but issued a statement saying papps decision assumed that new 
york jews are intolerant and have the power to suppress the first 
amendment rights of others 
i think there should be a stronger commitment to an open 
society mt mehdi president of the committee said at the news 
conference 
papp said there had been no pressure from jewish groups to 
suppress the play and called his decision a personal one 
i never objected to the play itself papp said after i 
agreed to present the play i discovered we were not putting on 
anything else about the israelipalestinian problem at the same 
time 
papp said he would like to present different plays covering a 
wide spectrum of views about the palestinian problem and indicated 
he would attempt to do so within 12 months 
in this particular instance ill have things that represent 
the whole issue of the palestinian situation and seek those types 
of plays whether they be palestinian or israeli plays papp 
said 
the story of kufur shamma will still be seen in new york it 
will be presented for seven performances beginning wednesday at 
the dance theater workshop an offoffbroadway company

a pilot trying to reenact the first 
flight across the english channel on its 80th anniversary was 
forced to ditch her plane just two miles short of the british coast 
today 
gloria pullan was commemorating french aviator louis bleriots 
july 25 1909 flight from calais france to dover england in an 
authentic bleriot xi monoplane the same type used for his crossing 
i took off from calais and it was a beautiful flight until i 
started losing power she said clutching her wet british 
passport gradually the aircraft went down and i had to ditch in 
the sea about two miles off dover 
ms pullan 36 was rescued by a royal air force helicopter 
after being in the water for three minutes 
she was taken to a field atop the famous white cliffs of dover 
where a large welcoming party was waiting on the spot where bleriot 
landed 
it was so sad she said i think the aircraft has been 
lost i was enjoying it so much and i would do it again any time i 
am sorry i could not bring the airplane into land for the official 
reception 
louis bleriot grandson and namesake of the pioneer aviator 
flew in a helicopter alongside ms pullans plane and saw it crash 
it was very sad seeing the aircraft go into the sea he said 
at dover i believe it sank i could not see it afterwards 
bleriots flight was staged in response to a challenge by

a group of international scientists 
hoped to get back to work on disarmament after criticism of the 
beijing crackdown by soviet physicist andrei sakharov triggered a 
walkout by chinese delegates 
the walkout at mondays opening session of the 39th pugwash 
conference came after sakharov condemned the chinese governments 
brutal repression of student protesters 
we cannot forgive or disregard the conduct of the chinese 
government and we must find ways to demonstrate this attitude 
the 1975 nobel peace prize winner said one of the two chinese 
delegates who walked out during the speech later confronted 
sakharov 
the sensitivity by chinese leaders over the crackdown 
meanwhile also was evident monday in comments made by han xu 
chinas ambassador to the united states 
at present the important thing is not to interfere in chinas 
internal affairs particularly when it is in difficulty do not 
make things more difficult han 65 said at a luncheon in west 
palm beach fla 
they were his first public comments since those terrible 
developments occurred in china he said adding that it would be 
his last as ambassador the 65yearold said he soon will retire 
and return to beijing 
han said additional economic sanctions against china hurt the 
united states as much as they hurt china the only effect on china 
that i can think of is that would push back china into the 
isolation of the old days 
at the conference m innas ali a nuclear physicist from 
bangladesh said sakharovs confrontation with the chinese did not 
dampen the optimism of most delegates 
now everybody is moving in the right direction toward 
disarmament he said but we still have to do some constructive 
work so this can be realized in practice 
about 200 scientists and statesmen from more than 30 countries 
are attending the fiveday conference which is being held in the 
united states for the first time in 19 years 
the pugwash conferences grew out of a 1955 statement by bertrand 
russell and albert einstein urging scientists of all political 
persuasions to devise ways to avoid nuclear war the first 
conference was held in 1957 at pugwash nova scotia 
most of the sessions are devoted to technical arms control 
issues and are closed to the public 
the chinese delegates waited outside the conference room during 
sakharovs 45minute speech which was largely devoted to soviet 
economic and environmental problems then one of them professor 
shi zhongben of beijing university confronted the 68yearold 
human rights activist 
trembling with emotion shi said sakharov did not understand 
chinese affairs and had chosen an inappropriate forum for his 
criticism 
we can build peace through international cooperation not by 
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries shi said 
sakharov remained impassive maybe i dont understand all the 
complexities of the situation in china but i think i was right 
he said later 
despite the incident shi and colleague niu qiang of the chinese 
peoples association for peace and disarmament said they planned to 
attend the rest of the conference 
two other chinese delegates kept their seats in another part of 
the room but it was unclear whether they did so deliberately or 
failed to notice the departure of shi and niu 
after the chinese army violently crushed the prodemocracy 
protest in beijings tiananmen square on june 34 with estimates 
of deaths running from several hundred to as high as 3000 the 
new soviet congress issued a guarded statement calling it an 
internal matter 
sakharov who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb in the 
1950s later spoke out against soviet human rights abuses and the 
war in afghanistan and was banished to internal exile in the city 
of gorky from 1979 to 1986

abc news apologized for an evening news show 
that did not clearly label a simulation of evidence in the bloch 
spy case but said it would continue to use such staged events 
the blunder in friday evenings world news tonight segment 
on american diplomat felix s bloch might have led some viewers to 
believe they were watching videotaped frames of bloch giving a 
briefcase to an agent of the kgb the soviet intelligence agency 
the networks two still pictures of the transaction were created 
by abc news staffers and were not taken from fbi footage of the 
alleged encounter abc news officials said monday 
it was a terrible mistake not to identify clearly the 
pictures as simulation richard wald senior vice president of abc 
news said in a telephone interview i regret it 
bloch is suspected of having spied for the soviets he has not 
been charged 
media critic ben bagdikian called into question the practice of 
using reenactments on news broadcasts calling them pure poison 
since the fox network got its ratings with americas most 
wanted its clearly an imitation of that its docudrama as 
news said bagdikian former dean of the graduate journalism 
school at the university of california berkeley 
wald defended reenactments saying they should be seen as 
extensions of courtroom sketches 
the abc simulation lasted about 10 seconds and included two 
grainy still shots of one man handing a briefcase to another 
abc correspondent john mcwethys narration at the time said 
it was not until earlier this year that bloch was videotaped 
handing over a briefcase to a known soviet agent on the streets of 
a european capital 
the sequence failed to include a simulation advisory as is 
customary 
abc newsroom guidelines say it should be made explicitly clear 
when the audience is watching a news simulation according to 
spokeswoman elise adde 
reenactments are becoming increasingly popular in other network 
programs as well nbcs yesterday today and tomorrow will use 
them when the show makes its debut later this month 
and news simulations are among the alternatives being considered 
for cbs west 57th which will be redesigned for the fall 
the fox broadcasting corp has attracted large audiences for its 
crime reenactments on americas most wanted a show designed to 
help capture fugitives

prime minister sousuke uno announced that he would resign to 
take responsibility 
a trader with yamaichi securities co speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the election was not having a major impact on tokyo 
markets 
abroad investors grasp that market fundamentals have not 
changed in japan and this has acted as a spur to active trading 
domestically he said 
domestic demandrelated issues received particular attention 
today there were large buying orders for housing issues the 
trader said 
in addition consumer products issues were bought on news that a 
tokyo court had ruled in favor of shuwa corp a large real estate 
firm that is trying to reconstruct the retail market through 
several unfriendly mergers 
liberal democratic party statements that the party would 
reconsider the new 3 percent sales tax also spurred buying of such

factor in the partys election loss 
on the foreign exchange market a dealer with the bank of tokyo 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was heavy buying of 
west german marks with yen today 
traders feel that selling yen against the dollar is dangerous 
so they are buying european currencies he said 
traders have said the market anticipates lower interest rates in 
the united states which would make dollars less attractive 
their reluctance to buy yen stems from the continuing political 
instability in japan the dealer said 
people feel that the political situation in japan will become 
chaotic again but the longer the chaos lasts the less important 
it will be he said

she should be above suspicion because of her concern for animal 
welfare

causes said in a statement issued sunday that the donkey charly 
was castrated by a veterinarian under anesthesia

ordering the operation 
i think i am above suspicion as to the way i treat and care 
for animals whether they are confided to me or belong to me she

a newspaper reported today that senior 
diplomat felix s bloch has already confessed to spying for years 
for the soviets in exchange for a guarantee of immunity from 
prosecution 
but the newspaper der standard quoted reliable cia sources 
as saying publicity of the case has cast doubt on the deal 
bloch who served as the secondincommand at the us embassy 
in the austrian capital during much of his stint there from 
198087 is in the united states under fbi investigation he has 
not been formally charged 
news reports of the spy probe began friday 
the daily which began publication last fall said without 
further detail that a preliminary investigation of bloch began in 
february 1988 and was completed in march of this year 
after taking office in january president bush appointed bloch 
director of the office of european regional politicaleconomic 
affairs in the state departments bureau of european and canadian 
affairs 
the newspaper did not refer to that appointment or explain how 
it could have been made if bloch was already under suspicion 
bloch was the highestranking us official ever implicated in 
an espionage investigation involving the soviet union he was 
reportedly filmed by us officials earlier this year passing a 
briefcase to a soviet kgb agent in a european capital 
by all accounts the austrianborn bloch had access to sensitive 
intelligence material during his career and officials expressed 
concern he could cause serious damage to us interests if he 
shared his secrets with foreign powers

felix s bloch suspected of passing secrets 
to the soviets is described by friends as a dull and dry us 
diplomat who badly wanted an ambassadors post 
bloch and his family remained under tight surveillance after 
media reports placing him at the center of what could be the 
biggest state department espionage case since the 1950s 
everybody is stunned and depressed said one state 
department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
friends and colleagues spoke of bloch as a precise analytical 
man respected for his grasp of european affairs but frustrated at 
the pace of his state department career 
dry bureaucratic competent ambitious was the description 
offered by his friend austrian foreign minister alois mock who 
has known bloch and his wife lucille for more than 30 years 
mock told austrian reporters that bloch chafed at serving under 
politically appointed ambassadors without becoming ambassador 
himself 
at his condominium near washingtons embassy row neighbors said 
bloch and his wife were reserved and private though friendly 
preston pitts a neighbor said bloch told him earlier this year 
that an ambassadors job might come soon he told me he was 
slated to be an ambassador to central or south america i didnt 
ask the country he hoped to be he was up for it 
pitts said the first sign anything was amiss came nearly a month 
ago when fbi agents began a heavy and visible surveillance of bloch 
agents were seen throughout the building and sitting in cars 
around it he said prompting concern and talk by many residents 
the agents were around here like ants they were too 
obvious said pitts i saw him in the hall and said felix 
are you in any danger he said no i thought they were here 
to protect him 
bloch was filmed by us officials earlier this year passing a 
briefcase to a known soviet kgb agent in paris according to 
sources the state department issued a statement saying it and the 
fbi were pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in order to identify the 
compromised security which has occurred and the appropriate steps 
no charges have been filed 
president bush described reports of spying by bloch as very 
serious 
bloch served in the us embassy in vienna from 198087 most of 
that time holding the no 2 post in the embassy 
bloch returned to washington in 1987 and became director of the 
state departments office of european regional politicaleconomic 
affairs he was considered a top specialist on the european 
community 
in austria he served under reagan ambassadorial appointees 
ronald lauder and before that helene von damm a longtime aide to 
reagan 
i did not like him said lauder a candidate for the 
republican nomination for mayor of new york city 
there was something about him that bothered me lauder said 
on abcs good morning america program the more i got to know 
him the more i realized there was something dramatically wrong 
however lauder said he did not suspect espionage 
bloch appeared to be more highly regarded among others a former 
austrian official ernst eugen veselsky called bloch 
substantially more knowledgeable than others 
bloch was born in austria and left that country at age 3 with 
his jewish parents bloch is a graduate of the university of 
pennsylvania and holds a masters degree from the university of 
california at berkeley 
he held a variety of state department jobs including economic 
counselor at the us embassy in east berlin in 1974 he later was 
an inspector who traveled to various embassies 
mock told reporters in austria that he learned of suspicions 
about bloch three weeks ago and that there was an allusion this 
might go back to the 1970s

orders for big ticket durable goods 
powered by a surge in sales of military goods rose a modest 03 
percent in june the government said today 
the commerce department said demand for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1241 billion the rise followed a large 44 percent decline in 
may the steepest in 10 months 
the modest rebound was unlikely to persuade economists that 
durablegoods sales one of the most interestratesensitive 
sectors of the economy because buyers must usually borrow to 
purchase them are breaking out of their recent sluggish pattern 
early in june the federal reserve board nudged interest rates 
down slightly ending a yearlong program of fighting inflation 
with higher interest rates the feds shift to easier credit likely 
will take several months to influence sales however 
excluding the volatile defense category which swings widely 
from month to month new orders fell 07 percent last month 
following a decline of 39 percent in may 
military orders shot up 158 percent in june to 88 billion 
after dropping 114 percent in may and plunging 183 percent in 
april 
the closely watched category of nondefense capital goods a 
barometer of business investment plans rose 05 percent in june to 
375 billion following a 77 percent plunge a month earlier 
the commerce department offered these other details of activity 
in june 
nonelectrical machinery orders rose 37 percent to 231 
billion reflecting an increase in purchases of steam engines and 
turbines 
electrical machinery gained 28 percent to 192 billion 
following a 61 percent drop in may 
transportation equipment declined 35 percent to 323 billion 
following a 97 percent drop a month earlier most of the decline 
came in motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding 
primary metals including steel were off 50 percent to 120 
billion following a 18 percent decline in may 
for the first six months of the year new orders totaled 7551 
billion 82 percent higher than the first half of 1988 the figure 
does not take inflation into account

us rep john conyers entered the race for 
mayor giving incumbent coleman young his stiffest challenge since 
he first won the job almost 16 years ago 
conyers 60 filed petitions for candidacy monday with city 
clerk james bradley amelie allen a worker in the clerks office 
said conyers had more than enough petitions to make him eligible 
im asking myself if im doing the right thing conyers 
said one is never sure about these great decisions 
but after filing the petitions he said theres no turning 
back 
speculation that the powerful 13term democratic congressman 
would run increased after conyers lambasted young two weeks ago 
saying the mayor has an unbroken record of personal and political 
mistakes in the last few years 
its time for him to go conyers said of young who is 
seeking his fifth 4year term 
nominating petitions bearing 55000 signatures also were filed 
monday on behalf of young spokesman robert berg said young had no 
comment on conyers candidacy berg said 
youngs critics have accused him of focusing on downtown 
development in the nations sixthlargest city at the expense of 
neighborhoods his years in office have seen a continuation of the 
white and middleclass flight from the city to the suburbs 
observers say conyers will force young who had planned on 
ignoring other candidates and campaigning against the news media 
to go on the offensive 
coleman young is an excellent campaigner an excellent vote 
getter but hes never had an established black candidate running 
against him and now hes got two said political consultant 
jack casey he referred to city council president erma henderson 
who is also running 
whats going to be fascinating now is whether the black vote 
will split casey said if it does white voters are going to 
have a lot to say about who is elected 
about 70 percent of detroits population of slightly more than 1 
million is black 
conyers was a founder of the congressional black caucus he is 
active in several rights organizations and is known battling south 
africas apartheid policy 
two other candidates accountant thomas barrow whom young 
defeated in 1985 and businessman charles costa also filed 
petitions monday candidates have until today to be eligible to run

pope john paul ii today appointed the first 
bishop in the soviet republic of byelorussia in more than 60 years 
underlining what the vatican called a new spirit in 
sovietvatican relations 
the pope named the rev tadeusz kondrusiewicz as apostolic 
administrator of minsk capital of byelorussia to look after the 
estimated 2 million roman catholics in the republic 
the vaticans deputy spokesman giovanni dercole said the 
vatican had informed soviet and byelorussian authorities of the 
decision to appoint the bishop 
these authorities in the new spirit established by the 
soviet government politely let the holy father know they had no 
difficulty in this regard dercole said in a written statement 
as a sign of the changing times dercole said that on march 10 
the pope had been able to appoint the first residential bishops in 
lithuania since the end of world war ii 
in another sign of the improving climate last week the vatican 
and predominantly roman catholic poland reestablished full 
diplomatic relations after a break of more than 40 years poland is 
the first soviet bloc country with diplomatic ties with the holy 
see 
john paul has said he is willing to meet with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev when he visits italy in november marking what 
would be the first meeting between a pope and a soviet leader 
one of the main obstacles to improved vaticansoviet relations 
is the status of the ukrainian catholic church which was forcibly 
merged with the russian orthodox church in 1946 however vatican 
officials say there is a strong underground ukrainian church and 
exiles report hunger strikes and protests by ukrainian faithful 
demanding full recognition of their church 
the pope has often expressed his desire to travel to the soviet 
union but only if he is allowed to visit his flock throughout the 
country including lithuania the ukraine and byelorussia 
dercole said there are about 60 priests and 100 catholic 
churches in byelorussia which has a population of nearly 10 
million 
its a community of catholics with a deep faith that has

the execution of four military officers on 
drugrunning charges and cubas nagging economic problems are 
putting a damper on this years festivities to mark fidel castros 
guerrilla origins 
in western countries highlevel corruption is often dismissed 
as the product of human frailty however it has been taken more 
seriously in cuba where the government takes pride in the 
revolutionary rectitude of its leaders 
there is no tradition for this sort of thing here said one 
cuban official on condition of anonymity 
cuba has viewed signs of moral turpitude in the united states 
and other western countries as an outgrowth of capitalist 
decadence which communist societies are supposed to be able to 
avoid 
that theory took a beating at the trial of army maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa sanchez on charges of smuggling tons of drugs into 
the united states in an alliance with colombias medellin drug 
cartel 
ochoa once a trusted adviser to president castro and a 
designated hero of the 30yearold cuban revolution had commanded 
cuban forces in ethiopia and angola he also headed a cuban 
military mission in nicaragua 
he was executed with three other military officers on july 13 
other officers convicted of corruption received lesser sentences 
castro has not spoken to the cuban people about the episode but 
he is expected to do so wednesday in camaguey 300 miles east of 
havana 
the speech marks the 36th anniversary of castros debut as a 
guerrilla fighter the occasion is national holiday and kicks off 
festivities throughout the island 
as a reflection of the current mood in havana western reporters 
arriving to cover the speech were told to avoid human rights 
activists and the relatives of ochoa or others put to death 
reversing a policy of greater tolerance authorities told 
reporters that violations of these restrictions could lead to 
expulsion from cuba or denial of future visa requests 
an associated press reporter who was absent when the warning 
was issued interviewed elizardo sanchez president of the cuban 
commission of human rights and national reconciliation 
sanchez called the executions murder under legalistic cover 
saying ochoa and other defendants were denied adequate legal help 
this charge was denied by the jurists union of cuba which said 
the defense attorneys carried out their duties with great 
professionalism 
supporters of the revolution expressed satisfaction with how the 
ochoa case was handled including the decision to execute the 
defendants 
sanchez said the trials occurred at a time of growing economic 
and political problems 
this view was shared privately by a government official who 
said the current period is among the most challenging the 
revolution has faced 
these are difficult times indeed he said 
sanchez said the economy is suffering a slow but sustained 
deterioration 
his remarks appeared to be borne out by widespread scarcity of 
food and other consumer goods 
the only sign of bread at one bakery in western havana were 
pictures of biscuits and other baked goods on a wall behind the 
counter on the bare shelves a sign promised bread in two hours 
insufficient wheat deliveries from the soviet union are blamed 
for the bread shortages

thundershowers rumbled across manitoba 
and saskatchewan today sending light rain on hundreds of forest 
fires that have blackened more than 22 million acres 
canadian officials held out hope that more rain later today 
would relieve the fires which have forced the evacuation of more 
than 19000 people from northern manitoba 
pilots trying to pick up people fleeing the fires have been 
frustrated by smoke so thick it turns the sun into a reddish smudge 
theres no sunlight to speak of at all northern affairs 
minister jim downey said after returning from the sparsely 
populated wooded region on monday its like dusk in the middle 
of the afternoon 
downey had flown with manitoba premier gary filmon to thompson 
the pas and flin flon where evacuatees were being taken 
hot dry winds blew flames perilously close to native 
settlements and mining towns and officials said thick smoke 
hindered evacuation efforts 
its sometimes an hourtohour situation waiting for the 
smoke to lift to a point where a plane can land said provincial 
government spokeswoman diana soroka 
thompson a mining city of about 15000 has taken in more than 
3000 evacuees it was many miles from the nearest fire monday but 
the citys airport was temporarily shut down because of the smoke 
the fire zone begins about 250 miles north of winnipeg and 
stretches about 220 miles from northeastern saskatchewan to 
northwestern ontario 
officials estimated 224 fires were burning in manitoba on 
monday but said that might not be accurate because they could not 
see the fire for the smoke 
soroka said some evacuees were being taken to brandon and 
winnipeg in the south were taking them wherever the room is 
she said people were being evacuated by plane train and car 
the province has not yet had to use its powers under the state 
of emergency declared sunday which include being able to 
commandeer private property 
military transport planes helicopters hoses pumps tents and 
other materials have been pouring in from other parts of canada and 
the united states 
about 1600 firefighters 53 helicopters 11 waterbombers nine 
fixedwing aircraft and several pieces of heavy equipment such as 
bulldozers have been thrown into the effort 
its estimated 25 million will be spent by the end of the week 
compared with 15 million for the whole season last year 
but the only thing firefighters can do is hold the lines around 
communities so far they have been relatively successful only a 
few houses and lodges have burned and there have been no reports 
of injuries or deaths

three black teenagers from a church group 
were barred from a whitesonly swimming pool owned by the jaycees 
who promised to investigate the incident 
the company that operates the pool for the jaycees refused to 
admit the teens on july 13 because the land on which it sits was 
willed to the club with a provision that blacks be excluded saluda 
jaycees president rickie turner said monday 
the teens were part of a group of 50 youths and adults who 
repair homes for the poor in a united methodist church volunteer 
program 
workers for the saluda swim and tennis club which runs the pool 
for the jaycees offered to allow whites in the group to swim but 
the entire group left said willie teague editor of the church 
newspaper 
its a rather sad commentary on the progress that we hoped we 
had made but apparently had not said teague who wasnt present 
it says that racism is still alive and well in south carolina 
the saluda swim and tennis club isnt listed in the local 
telephone directory 
the united states jaycees will look into the incident said dave 
nershi the groups executive director of marketing 
obviously it is not something that an organization such as 
ours can tolerate nershi said the fact that it happened to a 
group of volunteers only makes it that much more unconscionable 
the jaycees which number 240000 nationally prohibit 
discrimination based on race sex or creed 
local jaycees president turner who owns a service station 
said as far as im concerned they should have let the people 
swim and let them go on

sales of existing homes rebounded 59 percent 
in june following five months without a gain a real estate trade 
group said today attributing the rise to a decline in mortgage 
rates and falling prices 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
340 million units in june up from mays rate of 321 million 
units it was the first increase in sales since december 1988 and 
the largest increase since december 1986 when sales jumped 66 
percent 
the group also noted what it described as a small increase in 
the median sales price which was 93200 in june up 600 from may 
and 32 percent from a year earlier 
for the most part buyers coming into the market in june are 
the most vulnerable to rate swings theyre getting in while they 
can buying the most they can the homes theyre buying tend to be 
in the moderate price range said realtors president ira gribin 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp fixedrate 
mortgages peaked at 1122 percent in late march and have been 
falling since hitting 987 percent last week during june they 
fell from 1048 percent to 1007 percent 
economist richard peach of the mortgage bankers association of 
america said he expected sales to recover modestly through the rest 
of the year but he said sluggish economic and job growth overall 
will prevent a strong resurgence 
regionally sales were led by an 185 percent jump in the 
midwest to an annual rate of 960000 units the highest level since 
december sales rose 52 percent in the west to 610000 units and 
41 percent in the south to 128 million units 
in the northeast however sales fell 98 percent to a rate of 
550000 units the lowest since february 1985 
economist john a tuccillo of the realtors said midwestern sales 
are being bolstered by relatively low prices while the rapid rise 
in prices in the northeast over the past several years is 
preventing a sales rebound there

demanding prime minister rajiv gandhi 
resign opposition members today shouted insults and walked out of 
parliaments upper house a day after opposition lawmakers in the 
lower house resigned en masse 
the opposition is protesting alleged corruption in the gandhi 
government and is insisting that the prime minister step down and 
call new elections 
the demand for gandhis resignation stemmed from an auditors 
report that criticized the government for irregularities in the 
1986 purchase of artillery from the swedish firm ab bofors 
the opposition alleges that members of the government received 
kickbacks 
the governing congress party called todays move by 12 
opposition parties a stunt and gimmick before the general 
elections which gandhi must call by january 
the 12 parties control 106 seats in the 544member lower house 
or lok sabha gandhis party has a solid majority in the house and 
the opposition departure is not likely to affect parliaments 
functioning 
opposition leaders said they were giving up their seats hoping 
the purchase would become a major issue in the elections 
the 90 opposition members in the upper house or rajya sabha 
were asked to keep their seats to try to obstruct legislation 
passed by the lower house formal approval from the rajya sabha is 
needed before a law can be enacted 
before storming out of the 245member house opposition members 
chanted we want resignation as gandhi watched impassively 
as the din continued house chairman shankar dayal sharma said 
the house cannot be held ransom one opposition member replied 
the prime minister is holding the country to ransom 
both houses of parliament have stalled since the comptroller and 
auditor generals report on the gun deal was put before parliament 
on july 18 
the 14 billion deal to purchase howitzers has been a major 
scandal for gandhis government because of allegations that bofors 
bribed government officials and senior congress party members to 
secure the contract 
newspapers and opposition politicians say bribes up to at least 
50 million were paid the allegations have never been proved and a 
parliamentary committee investigation the deal last year concluded 
there was no evidence of kickbacks 
the auditor generals report said the arms purchase was flawed 
on technical considerations and cost assessment 
opposition leaders have previously demanded gandhis resignation 
on the issue but the 44yearold prime minister has repeatedly 
said he was not involved in any wrongdoing

wages salaries and other benefits paid to 
american workers rose 45 percent in the 12 months ending in june 
the government reported today 
the labor department said its employment cost index considered 
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures was pushed 
ahead both by rising wage costs and higher benefit costs 
wage pressures have intensified every quarter since june of 
1988 when the employment cost index rose above the 4 percent level 
for the first time 
in another sign of higher wage pressures the labor department 
said today that major collective bargaining settlements reached in 
the first six months of 1989 provided average wage increases of 37 
percent in the first year of the contract up from a 21 percent 
average firstyear increase the last time these contracts were 
negotiated 
over the life of the contracts the settlements negotiated in 
the first six months of this year called for average increases of 
33 percent annually compared to 25 percent average annual 
increases the last time the contracts were negotiated 
the various signs of increasing wage pressures have raised 
concerns among economists that tight labor markets are pushing 
labor costs higher and making the countrys inflation problems 
worse 
the federal reserve last year began pushing interest rates 
higher in an effort to slow the economy and lower the inflation 
rate 
that inflationfighting effort has caused the unemployment rate 
to edge up slightly in the recent months as economic growth slows 
because of this many economists believe that wage increases will 
moderate in coming months 
the 45 percent rise in the cost index for private industry 
workers covered total compensation which includes wages salaries 
and the employer costs of providing such benefits as health 
insurance 
the wage and salary component of the index climbed by 41 
percent in the 12 months ending in june while benefit costs rose a 
faster 56 percent 
the increase in wages and salaries reflected in part the 
influence of relatively large pay gains for sales workers a 
segment which is heavily influenced by volatile commission 
earnings the labor department said 
workers in the service sector of the economy fared better than 
the manufacturing sector in pay gains service industries saw wages 
and salaries go up by 47 percent in the past 12 months compared to 
a 32 percent rise for the manufacturing sector 
this gain reflects the fact that service industries have been 
more affected by shortages of workers in the past year 
however there was a wide split in the services category at the 
low end of the increases wages in the transportation sector and 
communications industry rose just 19 percent while wages at 
hospitals shot up 64 percent wages climbed an even faster 76 
percent in finance insurance and real estate but this increase was 
influenced by commission earnings 
the 45 percent increase in total compensation for private 
industry over the 12 months ending in june was close to a 46 
percent rise in the 12 months ending in march 
the 41 percent rise in wages and salaries was close to a 42 
percent increase for the 12 months ending in march a gain which 
had been the highest increase in more than three years

hundreds of beijing students rallied to vent 
their anger over the crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
students said today it was the first protest reported since the 
movement was suppressed in early june 
at least 300 beijing university students gathered outside their 
dormitories sunday night to sing sarcastic renditions of patroitic 
songs and to mourn those who died in the crackdown said students 
who participated 
they also were protesting that some work units especially in 
government offices have rejected some students assigned to work 
for them after expressing doubts about the students ideological 
purity the students said 
after about an hour the students marched to the campus area 
where students had put up thousands of political posters during the 
spring democracy movement said the participants 
they sang and beat pots and pans to mourn classmates who were 
killed june 34 when troops opened fire on student protesters and 
their supporters the students said 
china has said nearly 200 people died but chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as 
high as 3000 
one student said some young teachers housed in a dormitory next 
to the poster area joined sundays protest and lit firecrackers 
before the head of the schools communist party office ordered them 
all to go home 
the student said school officials are investigating those who 
participated in the twohour event but no one had been punished 
yet 
he said seniors the only ones left on campus now feel 
oppressed by the monthlong ideological study classes they have been 
forced to attend in order to graduate 
no one dares to say what he really thinks we all have to tell 
lies he said 
the student said his classmates on sunday night sarcastically 
sang patriotic songs like without the communist party there 
would be no new china and repeatedly shouted long live the 
communist party 
in their political education classes the students must study 
top leaders essays and speeches on the student movement which the 
government now calls a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
after reading and discussion the students are required to write 
essays about what they learned how their mistaken thinking was 
corrected and what they did during the protests 
the seniors are allowed to graduate only after they have 
submitted an acceptable essay students returning in the fall also 
will undergo political education 
students said the ideological training was not enough to satisfy 
some work units that the students assigned to them are politically 
acceptable students said 
no one seemed to know exactly how many students have been 
rejected by their work units but a student said all but one of 
those assigned to the state security bureau have been rejected 
job assignments were made in the spring before the crackdown 
most college graduates are assigned jobs by the government 
one government employee speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he was told to investigate a beijing university student 
assigned to his work unit to see if he had been active in the 
student movement

gary dotson who was freed from prison after a 
woman recanted testimony that he raped her isnt barred by the 
statute of limitations from getting a new trial a judge ruled 
the ruling monday by circuit judge thomas r fitzgerald clears 
the way for a hearing on dotsons request for a new trial to clear 
his name in the widely publicized case 
the judge rejected a state prosecutors assertion that the 
twoyear statute of limitations barring tardy prosecution applies 
to dotsons decadeold case he also rejected the states argument 
that newly developed genetic tests dotson wants to use in his 
defense are irrelevant 
were going to prove once and for all that he didnt do it 
dotsons sister laura said after the hearing dotson 32 who is 
in an alcoholism treatment center as a condition of parole didnt 
attend 
dotson was sentenced in 1979 to 25 to 50 years in prison for the 
1977 rape of cathleen crowell who later married and became 
cathleen webb in 1985 ms webb recanted her testimony saying she 
made up the attack because she feared she had become pregnant by 
her boyfriend 
gov james r thompson granted dotson clemency saying his 
punishment had been sufficient but the governor said he did not 
believe ms webbs aboutface and has refused to pardon dotson 
the judge set a hearing for aug 14 at which he is expected to 
schedule a hearing to determine if there should be a new trial 
the defense hopes to use new genetic tests to show that semen 
found on ms webbs underwear wasnt dotsons 
at mondays hearing states attorney gayle shines argued that 
the defense failed to prove the test results have a substantial 
probability of changing the outcome of the original trial a 
requirement for granting a new trial 
the absense of dotsons semen does not prove he didnt rape the 
woman she argued

an american diplomat suspected of spying for 
the soviets gave the austrian government information about a 
classified us probe against president kurt waldheims nazi past 
sources say 
felix s bloch served as the deputy chief of the us embassy in 
vienna at the time of waldheims june 1986 election and the us 
justice department probe of his record as an intelligence officer 
in the german army during world war ii 
bloch had inappropriate contacts with the austrian government 
on some important matters said his former boss ronald lauder 
now a republican new york city mayoral candidate who served as 
ambassador to austria in 1986 and 1987 
lauder said he did not like his deputy a veteran state 
department officer who served in vienna since 1980 and asked for 
him to be recalled in 1987 bloch was called home two months after 
waldheim was placed on a list of people banned from the united 
states for nazi activities 
a classified justice department probe found evidence that 
waldheim knew of and facilitated nazi atrocities in the balkans 
but it took a year during which austria and some us officials 
lobbied against restricting waldheim until he was placed on the 
socalled watchlist in april 1987 
the decision led to a virtual boycott by western governments of 
the austrian leader whose job is largely ceremonial 
bloch was very close to a major waldheim backer foreign 
minister alois mock and he constantly provided him with 
information on the status of the waldheim investigation and the 
watchlist decisions said one source familiar with the affair 
they were very tight from the days in the 1950s when mock 
and the austrianborn bloch studied together in italy said a 
government source who also requested anonymity 
bloch was clearly uncomfortable with the decision on 
waldheim said the source it stuck in my mind he added 
the sources spoke only on condition of anonymity 
bloch 54 was born to jewish parents in vienna and emigrated 
with them to the united states at the age of 3 before the outbreak 
of world war ii 
bloch who has not been charged with any crime was videotaped 
by us officials earlier this year passing a briefcase to a known 
soviet kgb agent in paris according to us sources 
at a vienna news conference monday mock said he had discussed 
all aspects of usaustrian relations with bloch but added 
there was nothing in particular that he regretted telling his 
american college friend 
bloch and his wife lucille first met mock in bologna italy 
where they studied under the auspices of baltimores johns hopkins 
university in 195758 
we then lost track of each other but i met him again in 1970 
when he was in berlin said mock he said he last saw bloch last 
fall and intended to see him again on a us trip scheduled to 
start tuesday he has since canceled the trip 
mrs bloch was asked last year to take over running the 
austrianamerican foundation a taxdeductible organization that 
promotes cultural links between the two countries 
it was flagging she was asked to inject some life into it 
to promote austrias image which was eroded by the waldheim 
affair said one austrian familiar with the matter 
the organization which was previously headquartered in new 
york moved to washington to accommodate mrs blochs wishes and 
took up offices one block from the white house 
meanwhile the world jewish congress which led the campaign 
against waldheim in 1986 issued a statement saying it was shocked 
to hear from lauder that mock was dealing behind the back of the 
us ambassador with a us official at the time when the waldheim 
investigation was under way in the united states

the soviets are showing extraordinary interest 
in the spy investigation against state department official felix s 
bloch even tailing him and the fbi to new york despite a us 
warning not to interfere 
the unusual soviet surveillance shows they have a lot invested 
in this said a government source familiar with the case 
the united states cautioned the soviet union against trying to 
smuggle bloch out of the country it was learned monday evening 
the warning came weeks before news organizations reported that the 
30year career diplomat was suspected of spying 
still bloch and a caravan of fbi agents were followed by soviet 
embassy personnel on saturday from washington to a new york city 
suburb the government source said 
another source said that while premature disclosure of the 
investigation had hampered the governments ability to complete the 
probe they have still got a good case against bloch 
formerly the no 2 official in the us embassy in vienna the 
54yearold diplomat was placed on leave with pay on june 22 he 
has surrendered his diplomatic passport and his state department 
credentials but has not been charged with any crime nor has his 
travel been restricted 
nevertheless president bush on monday called the allegations 
a very serious matter 
two us sources said monday that bloch had been videotaped 
handing a briefcase to a soviet agent in paris earlier this year 
another source said the kgb had tipped bloch that he was under us 
surveillance before he was suspended from his job on june 22 
abc news said the warning came in a telephone call intercepted 
by us agents in which the soviet agent told bloch a bad virus 
is going around and we believe you are infected 
bloch is refusing through an attorney to be questioned by the 
fbi but submitted to a brief interview by state department security 
officers early in the investigation according to a government 
source who like others providing details on the case spoke only 
on condition of anonymity 
counterintelligence experts said even if bloch were a spy it 
was too soon to know what secrets he compromised 
but they said the damage could be far different than that 
inflicted in other recent spy cases such as those of the john 
walker ring in the navy or national security agency technician 
ronald pelton they were lowranking american officials who 
compromised coding equipment and spying techniques that are very 
costly to replace 
unlike the military or us intelligence agencies which have 
been forced to deal with a number of recent spy cases the state 
departments foreign service has prided itself on being 
comparatively free of such problems 
the last was in 1961 when irvin scarbeck second secretary of 
the us embassy in warsaw was convicted of passing secrets to the 
east the most famous state department spy case involved alger 
hiss convicted in 1950 of lying to congress about passing secrets 
to whittaker chambers 
some experts said this case might seriously damage the morale of 
the foreign service the one thing they could say was were 
different our people dont go marching in to the other side 
because of resentments or whatever one source said 
bloch most recently has been director of the office of regional 
politicaleconomic affairs on the state departments european desk 
before that while in vienna he at one point lobbied to keep 
austrian prime minister kurt waldheim off the watchlist of 
people banned from the united states for nazi activities during 
world war ii a government source said 
waldheim eventually was placed on the list in april 1987 a move 
that infuriated many austrians 
after bloch fell under suspicion the soviets were informed 
through diplomatic channels in a message described as 
discreet that us relations with moscow would be damaged if 
they tried to make off with the diplomat a us official disclosed 
so far they have observed the admonition said the official 
but fbi agents tailing bloch on saturday on a trip to new york 
were followed in turn by soviet embassy personnel according to 
another government source 
the soviets followed a caravan of fbi agents driving behind 
bloch from washington to chappaqua ny where one of his 
daughters lives town police said the caravan arrived saturday 
afternoon 
while many soviet diplomats may not travel more than 50 miles 
from their post others have permission to make trips like the 
washingtonnew york drive the soviets are required to drive cars 
with diplomatic license plates which have letter codes designating 
the country using the vehicle 
in abcs initial report on the spy case last friday the network 
said soviet officials had been seen watching blochs washington 
apartment

three tamil groups today declared they 
will try to establish a separate state in northeastern sri lanka 
the announcement was a rebuff of president ranasinghe premadasa 
who on monday sent three cabinet ministers to urge the 
tamilcontrolled provincial council in trincomalee to support his 
efforts to get indian troops to leave sri lanka 
at a news conference in the city 150 miles northeast of colombo 
the groups said they founded a tamil national council and will seek 
a tamil homeland that shall be fully responsible for the 
tamilspeaking people 
india has said its troops who began arriving july 30 1987 
cannot leave until they complete their mission of disarming other 
tamil groups and the provincial council in trincomalee is allowed 
to exercise more local autonomy 
also today about 40 wives and children of indian diplomats left 
sri lanka to avoid any trouble that might arise this weekend the 
deadline set by premadasa for the departure of indian troops 
about 40 other relatives of indian diplomats and security 
staffers at the high commission returned to india on sunday 
according to a spokesman for the high commission or embassy 
a shadowy group called the workers action front believed to 
have links with sinhalese extremists called for a threeday 
protest against the indian presence starting wednesday 
sinhalese radicals accuse the government of making too many 
concessios to tamil separatists and not doing enough to get the 
indian troops to leave 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
tamils who make up 18 percent say the sinhalese discriminate 
against them in jobs education and use of the sinhala language 
military sources today reported 10 more killings of sinhalese in 
the past two days in colombo and the sinhalese heartland of 
southern and central sri lanka ultranationalist sinhalese from the 
peoples liberation front were blamed for seven of the deaths and 
the three others were front guerrillas killed by security forces

ku klux klansmen who clashed with black 
marchers in 1979 must attend a course on race relations taught by 
civil rights leaders as part of a settlement of a civil lawsuit 
the settlement was to be filed today in us district court in 
huntsville but had not reached the court by midmorning a clerk 
said in addition to mandating the civil rights course it requires 
roger handley former grand dragon of the knights of the ku klux 
klan and nine other alabama klansmen to pay 11500 in damages to 
the marchers 
our goal has always been to try and change the hearts and 
minds of those whose racial beliefs lead to violence against us 
said the rev joseph lowery president of the atlantabased 
southern christian leadership conference 
neither handley nor his attorney dan willingham could be 
reached for comment today a person at handleys home said he 
couldnt come to the telephone and willingham was reported out of 
his office until later in the day 
klanwatch a group operated by the southern poverty law center 
in montgomery filed the civil lawsuit in 1980 on behalf of the 
sclc which had organized the 1979 march in decatur 
it is an historic moment when the president of the group 
founded by dr martin luther king jr an ardent practitioner of 
nonviolence stands before the grand dragon of the alabama ku klux 
klan and expresses dr kings message of love lowery said in a 
statement released monday by klanwatch 
the settlement also requires several klansmen to perform 
community service and refrain from harassing blacks or joining any 
klan or white supremacist group for periods of up to five years 
probably the most unique aspect of this case is that seven of 
the defendants have to attend a race relations course said pat 
clark director of klanwatch we must find a way to change 
attitudes and give people an opportunity to assess their 
wrongdoings 
she said details of the twohour course which probably will be 
taught in birmingham next spring have yet to be worked out 
the suit was filed in 1980 after klanwatch investigators 
uncovered new evidence that eventually prompted the justice 
department to reopen its investigation of the may 26 1979 
incident 
a group of robed klansmen clashed with black marchers in decatur 
who were protesting the conviction the year before of a 19yearold 
mentally retarded black man for raping three white women gunfire 
erupted during the incident and two klansmen and two blacks were 
wounded 
ten klan members including handley the top klansman in alabama 
at the time of the incident were indicted in 1984 on civil rights 
charges all were either convicted or pleaded guilty earlier this 
year handley and six of his cohorts drew federal sentences ranging 
from two months to two years 
ms clark said the settlement of the civil lawsuit which came 
after several months of negotiations brought the 10yearold case 
to a close

la cellesaintcloud france ap cambodias hanoibacked 
government and three guerrilla factions broke off talks today 
without even an agreement on who would take part in an 
international peace conference set to begin sunday 
im totally pessimistic said prince norodom sihanouk 
representing one of three rebel groups meeting with prime minister 
hun sen in the talks in a chateau in this suburb southwest of paris 
sihanouk insisted that cambodia be represented at the conference 
opening sunday by all four factions his own another noncommunist 
group the communist khmer rouge and prime minister hun sens 
government 
however hun sen said there should be just two cambodian 
representatives sihanouk and himself 
a sticking point throughout complicated negotiations has been 
the role of the khmer rouge in the talks and later in the formation 
of a proposed transitional government following the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops from cambodia 
todays meeting was intended to be a search for common ground 
among the cambodian groups to prepare for the international 
conference 
but hun sen said the discussions were at an impasse and blamed 
the presence of the khmer rouge who were represented today by 
khieu samphan 
its like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot 
continue its journey hun sen said 
while there were no more talks planned among the leaders hun 
sen said he hoped that lowerlevel contacts would continue and 
that the international peace conference could open sunday as 
planned 
at his news conference hun sen announced that the vietnamese 
pullout would be complete by sept 27 
the final total withdrawal will take place from sept 21 to 26 
by way of land river and sea routes he said 
previously vietnam has promised to have its troops out by sept 
30 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to end a threeyear 
reign of terror by the khmer rouge in which hundreds of thousands 
of cambodians were killed 
there are fears the khmer rouge could trigger renewed civil war 
if they are given a share of power in an interim government as 
sihanouk demands 
sihanouk has the backing of many western nations including the 
united states but there has been increasing international support 
for reaching a settlement that does not include the khmer rouge 
us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said monday 
that preventing a return to power of the khmer rouge must be a key 
element in any settlement 
in thailand western analysts and thai military officers said 
fighting along the thaicambodian border where many refugee camps 
are located intensified in recent days 
the sources said 26 wounded soldiers had been brought to the 
international red cross hospital at kap choeng compared to an 
average number of wounded of a dozen per month 
last week shelling believed to have been conducted by 
provietnamese troops forced the evacuation of nearly 40000 
refugees from a khmer rouge border refugee camp known as site 8 
most have since returned the sprawling encampment

transit agencies still intend to buy buses 
with wheelchair lifts even though a federal court overturned a 
ruling that requires the lifts according to attorneys for 
handicapped groups 
the court upheld a federal provision that gives local agencies 
the right to decide how to serve the handicapped through 
accessible buses alternate transit services or a combination 
the ruling by the full 3rd us circuit court of appeals on 
monday overturned an earlier ruling by the us district court and 
a threejudge panel of the 3rd circuit 
the appeals court found that the lower courts had overstepped 
the boundaries of a lawsuit filed in 1988 by the american disabled 
for accessible public transit or adapt and several other groups 
a federal regulation already requires agencies to make new buses 
accessible to the handicapped and the groups filing the lawsuit 
never argued anyone was violating the provision circuit judge 
edward r becker wrote 
the issue has become a rallying point for handicapped activists 
with groups calling on the bush administration in february to let 
the original 3rd circuit ruling stand 
timothy cook who argued the case for adapt said monday night 
that we dont think anyone will read this to mean that buses 
wont have lifts 
attorney michael churchill who also represents adapt said that 
although the judges didnt specifically say so this court seems 
to believe that the purchase of all buses should be of those that 
are accessible 
adapt had argued the provision on local discretion conflicted 
with the regulation on accessible buses but the court disagreed 
the federal regulation strikes a balance between preserving 
local discretion avoiding the imposition of unduly burdensome 
costs and ensuring adequate transportation services for the 
handicapped becker wrote 
the government has estimated that mass transit authorities 
across the country would pay a total of 90 million a year on the 
lifts 
churchill said he would wait to see how the transportation 
department interprets the ruling before deciding on an appeal

the government news agency angop claimed 
today that rebels shot down a military transport plane with 48 
aboard killing 42 
spokesman for the rebels in washington and the us state 
department said they had heard no word of the reported sunday 
attack and the claim could not be independently verified 
the plane a sovietbuilt twinengine antonov 26 was carrying 
a delegation of regional officials from luena to cazombo in eastern 
moxico province sunday when it was hit in the left engine by a 
missile a military official said 
the plane crashed about 25 miles west of cazombo the official 
said 
an unidentified military source quoted by the portuguese news 
agency lusa said the downing of the plane is more than a 
ceasefire violation angola cannot tolerate the rebels 
continuing to act with impunity 
in washington spokesmen for state department and the 
ussupported rebels of the national union for the total 
independence of angola said they had heard no word of the reported 
attack 
reports of the attack and a spate of other ceasefire violations 
come six days before peace talks are to begin in zaire between the 
marxist government and the rebels 
the rebels on sunday attacked and occupied the towns of 
quimbele and cuimba in northern uige province close to the zairean 
border the luanda official said 
rebel forces on monday ambushed vehicles in lunda south 
province killing 16 people and fired mortars over kuito the 
provincial capital of bie killing two or three people he added 
the government delegation in the plane was apparently on its way 
to cazombo as part of a recent national program to explain to 
provincial populations the terms of an agreement reached with unita 
on june 22 the official said 
both government forces and unita rebels have accused each other 
of violating the ceasefire that began june 24 but lasted only one 
week 
the rebels have been fighting cubanbacked government troops 
since shortly after angola gained independence from portugal in 
1975

strikes that swept across soviet coal fields for 
two weeks dwindled today to scattered stoppages but new walkouts 
broke out in estonia while the countrys legislature debated how to 
deter future strikes 
in the donetsk coal basin the countrys largest local 
officials said most of the ukranian regions 300000 strikers 
returned to work after they heard the results of their strike 
committees meeting with premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
ryzhkov sat down monday with the miners and worked out a 
concrete program of actions for the entire countrys coal 
industry said pravda the communist party newspaper 
in estonia workers at shipbuilding factories and several other 
plants struck today to protest recent measures that favor the 
native estonian population of the restive baltic republic the 
official soviet news agency tass said 
a republicwide strike committee of nonestonian workers called 
the strike monday tass said it demanded cancellation of a recent 
law promoting the estonian language and withdrawal of a proposal to 
allow only longtime residents to run for local office 
lawmakers of the supreme soviet the national legislature today 
debated a statement promising workers the legislature would act 
decisively and effectively to do everything necessary for the 
strengthening of social stability the government newspaper 
izvestia reported 
government concessions to strikers have included promises of pay 
raises increased benefits and more economic independence for 
mines as well as shipments of scarce food and clothing 
viktor g kucherenko head of the legislatures planning and 
budget commission said during a break in the legislative session 
on monday that strike settlements would cost up to 86 billion 
in voroshilovgrad which is in the donetsk basin 550 miles south 
of moscow about 26800 workers at 47 out of the regions 93 mines 
remained on strike tass said 
the donetsk strikers were among the last holdouts during the 
nationwide coal strike that started july 11 in western siberia and 
spread from the arctic to central asia 
last week the more than 100000 striking siberian miners 
returned to work after the government promised to meet virtually 
all their demands 
president mikhail gorbachev has issued repeated appeals to the 
miners sympathizing with their plight and blaming official trade 
union and mining officials for precipitating the strikes by 
neglecting miners needs 
but he has warned that the strikes could jeopardize his economic 
reforms 
in vorkuta in the arctic the city strike committee ended the 
walkout monday after listening with great attention to 
gorbachevs appeals tass reported but strikers warned they would 
walk out again if the government did not keep its promises the 
news agency said 
however valery serdyuk the citys communist party chief said 
none of vorkutas mines was working regularly yet most miners were 
waiting for formal approval by the soviet council of ministers of 
their demands he said in a telephone interview 
tass said the strikes in the donetsk region alone cut coal 
production by 12 million tons and in the western siberian kuznetsk 
coal basin by at least 1 million tons according to official 
reports 
poor transportation is also hurting donetsk coal supplies tass 
said with piles of unshipped coal lying around and often catching 
on fire 
tass said the strike had not led to any accidents in donetsk 
mines but 40 percent of the mines walls badly needed maintenance 
gorbachev told the supreme soviet on monday the strikes were the 
biggest test so far of his 4yearold economic reforms and called 
for a shakeup of local governing councils which are frequently 
blamed for blocking progress 
last week he appealed for a renewal of communist party 
ranks from top to bottom and his suggestion that local governing 
bodies also be transformed could mean sweeping leadership changes 
local elections scheduled in the spring throughout the soviet 
union involve multiple candidates and for the first time offer 
serious challenges to entrenched officials 
some members of the supreme soviet said monday the elections 
should be held earlier gorbachev said each of the soviet unions 
15 republics should decide when and how to hold the elections

hundreds of people remained out of their 
homes today while officials prepared to extinguish a burning 
railroad chemical tank car that was among 14 cars that derailed 
saturday 
the fire dwindled enough monday to allow officials to cut the 
original evacuation zone around the derailed freight train by more 
than twothirds from 15 square miles to 4 square miles 
chemicals in the car form hydrochloric acid when burned but the 
acid wasnt endangering people officials said the evacuation was 
a precautionary move 
a very lazy fire continued today in one car said r lindsay 
leckie spokesman for csx transportation inc owner of the cars 
firefighters planned to use an air line to accelerate the blaze and 
burn off remaining gases and moisture then smother it with sodium 
bicarbonate powder he said 
he said the remaining cars would be removed once the fire is out 
meanwhile it was revealed that the brakeman of the wrecked 
train checked himself into a local hospitals substance abuse 
program after the derailment 
the brakeman whose identity was withheld entered the hospital 
a few hours after giving federally required blood and urine 
samples william loftus executive director of the federal railroad 
administration revealed monday 
but loftus emphasized that human error had been ruled out as a 
cause of the derailment and the brakemans actions did nothing to 
change that the precise cause hasnt been determined 
loftus refused to divulge the mans name the hospital he 
entered or the substance hes believed to have used 
the guys not going to turn himself in if hes clean loftus 
said 
the evacuated families wont be allowed to go home until the 
fire is out and workers have cleaned up the derailed cars two of 
which contain chemicals said leckie 
no accurate count was available of the number of people 
evacuated unofficial figures ranged from 400 to 2000 but leckie 
and tittabawassee township officials refused to make any estimate

syd straw former lead singer for the golden 
palominos han music on her mind like dinosaurs 
and ants 
she keeps maps and pictures of dinosaurs around her apartment 
and she wont step on ants because she cant stand the idea of 
harming living creatures in any way 
music is her lihas a lot more tfe but when she picks up a newspaper 
the 
science section is opened first straw often wonders about 
extinction and erosion what will happen to the world 
she feels the same way about people priding herself on the 
diverse group of musicians she assembled for her debut solo album 
surprise 
i bend over backwards to make sure the people playing for and 
with me are enjoying it and feeling good straw said 
thats probably my maternal instinct happygoluck accordion 
of matt irving straw recorded almost 
magic cowritten by former bandmate matthew auerbach with a 
103degree fever completely blacking out at one point 
she closes side 1 with stephen fosters traditional ballad 
hard times and side 2 with another slow song her own golden 
dreams 
i like to rock and i like to give the impression of being a 
sensitive soul also she said i thought a lot about the song 
order its not quite accidental that both sides end in a similar 
way i want to leave people thinking 
on crazy american she sings any place i hang my hat is 
someone elses home the lyrics recall her years in new york when 
she depended on the kindness of friends and strangers for shelter 
i didnt live anywhere for years ok ill live in your 
apartment for two weeks oh youre coming back nine days early 
youll be here in 10 minutes fine that is a pretty common 
situation in new york city a lot of people sort of live around 
like that she said 
straw whose parents were both actors grew up in montrose 
calif where she enjoyed playing hideandseek in her neighbors 
yards and sitting on a wall singing neil youngs heart of gold 
she headed for new york after high school taking acting classes 
and managing several walkon appearances on saturday night 
live hearing a local singer perform one night inspired straw to 
take up music herself 
music saved my life it gives me a raison detre she said 
i wouldnt want to be a nonmusical person i am so musical every 
minute of my life i have trouble with people who dont give a damn 
about music usually they dont give a damn about animals 
either 
her career began to pick up at in late 1985 when she met drummer 
anton fier mastermind of the golden palominos at the bitter end 
nightclub 
id say sparks were flying some kind of friction was in the 
air we kind of took each other and started jousting that night he 
walked me home and said you want to sing on my record i said 
maybe and i did 
she learned quickly to be ready for anything with the palominos 
singing rock country and avantgarde with an everchanging band 
behind her after two albums visions of excess and blast of 
silence straw left the group to start a solo career in 1987 
anyone as motivated as i am would feel very frustrated it 
wasnt enough to live on she said i like being in control of 
my own music previously i had to answer to anton because it was 
his group he was the one mixing now im the one behind the

the dramatic scene of a lone man stopping a 
column of tanks was shown on national tv tuesday for the first time 
as china broadcast the second part of a government documentary on 
the crushed prodemocracy movement 
the cable news networks beijing bureau said it believes china 
pirated the sequence from cnn or abc 
terry frieden cnns acting news manager in beijing said his 
cameraman believed the tank man sequence was taken from cnn or abc 
news footage because of the angle from which it was shot 
the man who briefly stopped the tanks during the armys attack 
on demonstrating students last month eventually was pulled from the 
street by friends the hong kong press later identified him as a 
19yearold student wang weilin and said he was arrested 
the chinese documentary a test of blood and fire did not 
mention his fate but said he was not shot or crushed by the tanks 
at the scene because the soldiers showed restraint 
john liu cameraman for cbs news said he recognized footage 
from cbs and abc in other parts of the fourpart documentary which 
china central television began showing monday abcs bureau could 
not be reached immediately for comment 
it was not the first time chinese tv used foreign footage 
apparently intercepted from satellite transmissions shortly after 
the june 34 army crackdown chinese tv showed abc footage of a 
chinese man claiming that 20000 people were killed and urged the 
public to turn the man in two women reported on him the next day 
and he was tried and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
tuesday nights halfhour segment of the documentary showed the 
period after martial law went into effect may 20 through the bloody 
weekend of street fighting 
both it and mondays first part have shown some events out of 
sequence apparently to strengthen the government line that 
anticommunist intellectuals were behind the student protests 
at important junctures in the second segment the sound was 
turned down or off the documentary showed students talking to or 
shouting at soldiers but it was impossible to hear what they were 
saying 
and in the brief segment on the military crackdown of june 34 
the silent video showed students throwing rocks and bricks at army 
vehicles but the sound of gunfire was missing 
the documentary also included footage shot by police tv crews 
and from cameras mounted along main streets 
some previously unseen footage was shot from inside the glassed 
locked entrances to subway stations where police camera crews 
apparently fearing for their lives on the streets sought shelter 
the pattern of the station glass could be seen across the picture

parliament extended zimbabwes state of 
emergency for six months tuesday after the government said it 
needed wideranging powers to deal with threats from south africa 
and border raids by rebels from mozambique 
home affairs minister moven mahachi cited sabotage and 
infiltration by agents of whiterun south africa as a continuing 
threat to national security 
he said the government expected hostile activities by south 
africa against its blackgoverned neighbors to increase after 
independence elections in namibia in november scheduled to end 
south african control over the southwest african territory 
in the past south africa has mounted several attacks in 
zimbabwe against facilities of the african national congress the 
main guerrilla organization fighting the government in pretoria 
that regime in south africa always blames us whenever there 
is an uprising in their country mahachi told legislators 
since the last renewal of the emergency in january there was a 
marked increase in crossborder attacks by rebels in 
neighboring mozambique he said as well as what he described as 
counterrevolutionary and antisocial activities in zimbabwe 
itself 
about 80 zimbabweans were slain by mozambique national 
resistance rebels who were also blamed for 78 abductions 14 
clashes against troops and 72 armed robberies mahachi said 
zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965 when it 
was introduced by the government of former rhodesian prime minister 
ian smith to crack down on black nationalists 
the emergency which has been renewed by parliament every six 
months since independence in 1980 allows for detention without 
trial 
on tuesday one outspoken legislator was prevented on procedural 
grounds from listing 50 alleged abuses of the state of emergency 
since 1982

when foreign minister qian qichen arrives in 
africa on wednesday there will be three highlevel chinese envoys 
on a continent that has gotten relatively little attention from 
china in the past decade 
criticized by the west for its crackdown on student 
prodemocracy protesters china has rediscovered its third world 
identity temporarily cast aside in the 1980s while the leadership 
pursued modernization and riches 
qians trip his longest journey abroad in 15 months as foreign 
minister will take in six countries and last 18 days at the same 
time assistant minister yang fuchang is visiting five west african 
countries also for 18 days and the deputy head of the communist 
partys international liaison department is visiting the congo 
the nations of sao tome and principe and ethiopia were among the 
first to send government or ruling party delegations to china after 
its june 34 army attack on student protesters a trade delegation 
from ghana is in beijing this week 
china and african countries always show each other sympathy 
understanding and support whether in their common struggle or in 
difficult times premier li peng said in a message to the 
organization of african unity summit meeting in ethiopia 
the profound friendship and close cooperation existing between 
china and africa can stand the test of storms he said 
the entire third world is proving to be a haven of calm for 
chinese foreign relations 
indias foreign secretary was the first senior foreign envoy to 
visit china after the army crackdown pakistan bolivia and 
malaysia have sent delegations 
several soviet and east european groups also have come and vice 
premier tian jiyun went to moscow last week for regular economic 
and trade talks in the first trip abroad by any highlevel chinese 
leader since the crackdown began 
but even soviet parliamentarians registered their opinion about 
the crackdown urging china to show reason and wisdom most third 
world countries some with their own histories of repressing 
dissent have been nonjudgmental 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted the foreign minister 
of sao tome and principe carlos dias da graca as expressing 
understanding and support for the measures taken by the chinese 
government when he visited in june china said it was giving the 
african nation an interestfree loan although it did not specify 
the amount 
africa has been the main recipient of what relatively little 
foreign aid china has given in the first three decades of 
communist rule china sent 150000 technicians to africa to help 
build more than 500 projects 
the biggest a 1160mile railroad from the capital of 
landlocked zambia through tanzania to the coast cost the lives of 
145 chinese workers before it was completed in 1975 
china financed a 100 million fertilizer plant in tanzania a 
gymnasium in kenya and a parliament hall in cape verde highways in 
madagascar and a sugar refinery in togo were built with chinese 
funds 
in return china gained a sense of solidarity with other 
developing nations at a time when it was isolated from most east 
and west bloc countries and feared attack from both 
china once again feels isolated and beleagued as illustrated by 
a recent commentary in economic reference news us criticism it 
said is not an isolated incident but a component part of an 
international political adverse current initiated by some us 
influences in recent years 
the commentary said china is the victim of western plotting to 
lure it into conducting reforms to weaken and even get rid of 
the communist leadership 
chinas new third world emphasis can be seen not only in its 
diplomatic exchanges but in a noticeable increase of third world 
news on xinhua and state tv the evening news carried a fourpart 
series last week on the tanzaniazambia railway and has begun 
running stories on industrial production in african countries 
the third world however cannot offer the soft loans and 
technology china has been counting on to fulfill its goal of 
doubling gross national product by the year 2000 
an upbeat xinhua news analysis about uspolish relations may 
indicate what chinese hope will happen to their strained ties with 
the west 
without mentioning the parallel to chinas situation it noted 
the united states and other western countries imposed economic 
sanctions against poland after it declared martial law in 1981 and 
outlawed the independent solidarity trade union 
the situation began to change it noted after the polish 
authorities announcement to end martial law in 1983

survivors of the fiery dc10 crash 
credited flight attendants for maintaining calm and helping 
passengers escape from the wreckage 
helen hayes of denver sat in row nine at the front of the middle 
cabin section and said a flight attendant whose name she didnt 
know helped prevent panic 
her voice was very soothing ms hayes said from her 
hospital room she prevented the passengers from going into 
complete hysteria 
seven of the eight flight attendants on the plane survived the 
tumbling crash of the united airlines jet at the sioux gateway 
airport on wednesday the three crew members in the cockpit also 
survived 
in all of the 296 people on the plane 111 were killed 
united spokesman robb doughty said flight attendants have 
landing positions in jump seats which are bolted to bulkheads in 
reinforced sections of the cabin thats deliberate he said so 
they can aid passengers in getting out of the airplane 
they sit there so they can manage the evacuation through the 
doors he said 
ms hayes said she was sitting near one of the flight attendants 
while the plane flew toward sioux city for an emergency landing and 
could see the fear on her face although she said passengers 
further away probably couldnt she said the flight attendants 
issued instructions on what passengers should do right up to the 
time the crippled jumbo jet hit the ground 
it must have been very difficult for them to do that she 
said

many vietnamese refugees were hurt in weekend 
clashes with police at a crowded hong kong detention center the 
un refugee agency said tuesday 
only four vietnamese requested treatment for injuries after the 
confrontations including three who said they were hurt 
accidentally police said 
one refugee died in unclear circumstances but not of natural 
causes according to police and robert van leeuwen the un high 
commissioner for refugees in hong kong 
the incidents occurred at sek kong detention center a former 
military airfield where more than 7000 vietnamese asylumseekers 
live in tents they are among 50000 vietnamese who escaped their 
communist homeland by boat to seek temporary sanctuary in the 
british colony of hong kong 
police say about 200 vietnamese hurled stones at their guards 
sunday night when the guards started investigating holes in the 
barbed wire fence around the camp order was restored but violence 
flared again several hours later when police carried out a search 
for makeshift weapons 
the clashes came during reported growing tension in the colonys 
detention centers amid indications that britain and vietnam are 
near agreement on the forced repatriation of those who cannot prove 
they fled political persecution 
preliminary indications are that a considerable number of 
people have been injured in the incident van leeuwen said on the 
state radio 
in the case of the dead refugee initial findings of an autopsy 
showed he did not die of natural causes according to a police 
statement it said police are investigating the case 
police assistant commissioner richard smallshaw said only four 
vietnamese men requested treatment after the disturbance including 
one requiring hospitalization 
the other three claim they were accidental injuries and were 
not the result of police action he told the radio theyre 
very minor indeed 
van leeuwen was quoted in the englishlanguage south china 
morning post as saying women and children apparently were among the 
injured smallshaw denied that 
the vietnamese at sek kong are among boat people who must prove 
they are political refugees and not economic migrants hong kong 
and other southeast asian authorities say they cannot cope with an 
influx of tens of thousands of vietnamese who brave storms and 
pirates in flimsy boats to escape their homeland in hopes of 
winning asylum in countries such as the united states

bombings in mecca during the annual 
pilgrimage to the holiest city of islam focused attention once 
again on an ideological struggle for leadership of the worlds 1 
billion moslems 
the bombings were a major setback for efforts to end the rift 
between saudi arabia and iran currently the main protagonists in 
the centuriesold schism between the sunnis and shiites islams 
leading sects 
two bombs exploded in mecca saudi arabia on july 10 during the 
hajj or pilgrimage to the shrines of islam killing a pakistani 
pilgrim and wounding 16 people a third explosion july 17 caused no 
casualties 
official saudi statements did not fix blame but the bombings 
were widely believed to be the work of iranians 
tehrans fundamentalist shiite regime accused the saudis of 
planting the bombs in an attempt to discredit iran and renewed 
their demand that custodianship of the holy sites be taken away 
from the saudi royal family 
ayatollah abdolkarim musavi ardebili chief justice of iran 
declared we want god to give us the strength to throw out 
the corpse of this tahgut idolatrous despot from the house of 
god 
his statement goes to the heart of the rift between the sunnis 
who account for 80 percent of moslems and the minority shiites 
the saudi royal family and most of their 12 million subjects are 
sunnis and irans population of 50 million is overwhelmingly 
shiite 
custody of mecca and medina is a pillar of the saudi royal claim 
to legitimacy so irans demand has political as well as religious 
significance two years ago king fahd underscored his religious 
role by declaring his primary title to be custodian of the holy 
places 
shiites believe religion and politics cannot be separated and 
the hajj must be a forum for political action such as rallies 
against the united states and israel that view is anathema to the 
saudis 
fahds hajj and endowments minister abdelwahab abdelwasei 
accused iran of seeking to fan the flames of sedition in islamic 
ranks and said saudi arabia was determined to resist all 
attempts at maneuvers pressures and provocations 
the latest developments appeared to dash hopes in the persian 
gulf region that the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on june 3 
signaled the end of irans virulent fundamentalism and the 
emergence of more moderate policies 
conservative arab states in the area governed by royal 
families have felt threatened for the past decade by irans 
efforts to export the revolution that overthrew the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi in february 1979 
saudi arabia severed relations with tehran in april 1988 citing 
terrorism and subversion 
fahd acted after 402 pilgrims most of them iranians were 
killed in clashes with riot police in mecca on july 31 1987 
during the hajj the first two bombings this year occurred on the 
second anniversary of the riots reckoned by the moslem lunar 
calendar 
saudi arabia says the iranians instigated the riots by defying a 
ban on political activity during the pilgrimage iran claims the 
saudis massacred its pilgrims 
the saudis won moslem support for limiting pilgrims to 1000 for 
every 1 million of a countrys population the ostensible purpose 
was to reduce crowding in the holy cities during major construction 
of more facilities but the clear intent was to curb the iranians 
under the quota system irans usual contingent of about 150000 
pilgrims would be reduced by twothirds as a result iran 
boycotted the hajj in 1988 and this year 
ayatollah ali khamenei successor to khomeini as irans 
religious leader accused saudi arabia on july 6 of blocking the 
faithful from performing the hajj to gratify america and israel 
and said iran will not forget these hostilities 
before the hajj bombings which occurred four days after 
khameinis speech king fahds government had been quietly trying 
to promote reconciliation with iran 
arab diplomats said oman was communicating ideas and 
conditions between iran and saudi arabia and that other arab 
states notably kuwait had made their own efforts 
according to the diplomats the saudis set out three 
irrevocable conditions for coexistence with iran 
noninterference in saudi internal affairs a pledge to abandon 
political activities during the pilgrimage and acceptance the hajj 
quota system 
khamenei has said however we have pledged to god to continue 
imam khomeinis path which is the path of islam our main 
aim is to revive islam once again and return to koranic values 
we will not retreat an inch on this

two former aides to ptl founder jim 
bakker were convicted today of evading taxes on 12 million they 
allegedly took from the tv ministry to spend on luxury 
condominiums jewelry and designer clothes 
james and david taggart were found guilty of one count each of 
conspiracy and four counts of evading taxes the jury deliberated 
for nearly five hours monday evening and early today before 
reaching the verdict at 1115 am 
us district court judge robert potter set aug 25 as a 
tentative sentencing date each brother could be sentenced to 25 
years in prison and face fines of more than 1 million 
potter released the taggarts on 50000 unsecured bond the same 
figure that has been in effect since the two were indicted 
prosecutors had asked that it be raised but the judge said he 
would take a risk 
both taggarts sat quietly as the verdict was read david taggart 
looked at the jurors as they were polled individually james 
taggart continued to stare straight ahead 
prosecutor david brown said the verdict was not about ptl it 
was about david taggart and james taggarts obligations to pay 
their taxes no matter how much they own and what kind of lifestyle 
they live 
greed doesnt pay no matter how rich you are youve got to 
pay your taxes brown added 
in closing arguments monday the brothers lawyer had argued 
that they had received more than 1 million in ministry funds with 
bakkers approval but prosecutors told jurors to ignore bakkers 
role in the case 
this case is about a crime brown said did they willfully 
defraud the united states 
the taggarts were charged with evading more than 525000 in 
income taxes after spending nearly 12 million in ptl money on 
personal luxuries such as condominiums jewelry and designer 
clothes 
defense lawyer ben cotten had said bakker the ptl founder who 
resigned amid a sex and money scandal agreed to give david taggart 
access to the same resources that he enjoyed if the federal 
government was owed taxes ptl would be required to pay them 
the intent was not to beat the irs out of money it was to 
have ptl shoulder the burden cotten said in his closing 
arguments 
but brown said the taggarts tried to conceal the money they took 
from ptl and he told jurors not to consider the actions of bakker 
or his former top aide richard dortch 
this case is not about them brown said 
bakker and dortch are scheduled to go on trial for wire and mail 
fraud aug 28 in charlotte 
closing arguments in the taggart case came on the 12th day of 
the trial 
before beginning his remarks cotten placed items from such 
exclusive new york stores as cartier and gucci on a bench in front 
of the jury the prosecution said the brothers bought items from 
those stores with funds stolen from the ministry 
if what is on trial here is a lifestyle you dont like then 
we didnt need a trial at all he said as he picked up the items 
brown however told the jury that of the 12 million the 
taggarts allegedly took 750000 was in cash 
people dont routinely use hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
cash unless theyre trying to conceal something said brown

wives incomes have increased nearly twice as 
fast as their husbands in recent years but the man is still the 
major breadwinner for most families the census bureau reported 
tuesday 
between 1981 and 1987 the average earnings of wives jumped 233 
percent while husbands income climbed 118 percent in the same 
period according to the study earnings of marriedcouple 
families 1987 
that brought the average income of wives to 13245 in 1987 
compared with 29154 for husbands 
more of them wives are working yearround full time 
instead of part time explained census statistician robert w 
cleveland in past years he said women were more likely to accept 
parttime jobs resulting in lower average income 
also more women are in professional and technical jobs which 
tend to have better pay cleveland added 
one factor in this change he said is the tendency of women to 
have pursued more education in recent years 
in addition said cleveland i think there is more equal 
treatment things are not as discriminatory for women the 
opportunities are more available for them now than in the past 
still wives continue to lag behind their husbands in income 
wives working fulltime at least 50 weeks per year averaged 
18929 in 1987 only 57 percent of the 33305 earned by husbands 
who worked full time 50 weeks or more 
recent government statistics for all men and women married and 
unmarried showed women averaging 65 percent of mens income 
somewhat more than the 57 percent for fulltime working wives 
wives are more likely to have to take time off to tend children 
or to have delayed careers during child rearing than women in 
general 
indeed the effect of children may be noted in the incomes of 
wives by age as reported in the study 
the most rapid income rise between 1981 and 1987 was among wives 
aged 35 to 44 who saw their average jump 315 percent more than 
triple the 98 percent increase for husbands in the same age group 
in that age bracket the kids are grown the women can enter 
the labor force and start working full time cleveland said 
for all wives those with no children averaged 14256 in 1987 
compared with 13067 for women with children aged 6 to 17 12163 
for those with children under age 6 and just 10732 for those 
with children in both age groups 
husbands averaged 31636 for those with children aged 6 to 17 
while those with some under 6 and some 6 to 17 averaged 29564 
for those with children under 6 average income was 28181 and it 
was 27755 for husbands without children 
while husbands may bring home most of the bacon for a majority 
of families that isnt a universal situation 
about 53 million wives earned more than their husbands in 1987 
about 18 percent of the 291 million married couples in which both 
husband and wife had earnings the report said 
in many cases husbands were 55 or older and often partly 
retired cleveland observed while their wives tended to be 
slightly younger and still working full time wives who earned more 
than their husbands were more likely than other wives to have 
attended college and to have no children at home the report found

switzerlands main accident 
insurance group called tuesday for legal limits on noise levels at 
rock concerts to protect fans from ear damage 
in the absence of statutory noise limits concert organizers 
should give away free ear plugs with tickets the swiss accident 
insurance agency said 
the proposal that noise levels should not be higher than 100 
decibels drew an angry reaction from concert organizers who said 
such measures would prompt rock stars to bypass switzerland 
it would be the death of rock concerts in switzerland said 
saemi hafen of good news the countrys largest promoter 
its a typical suggestion from people with nothing better to 
do said hanns hanneken editor of the magazine music scene 
the agency said many people suffered ear damage after attending 
concerts with noise levels of between 100 and 120 decibels 
the pain barrier is reached at 125 decibels under swiss law 
workers have to wear earplugs if the noise limit is more than 87 
decibels

the new fashion and lifestyle magazine mirabella 
has made its debut but will this guide for the welleducated woman 
be a lasting hit or will it join the heap of new magazines that 
fold in a few years 
its going very well i think wonderfully well said grace 
mirabella the editor the first issue in june of 600000 copies 
sold out but this veteran of the competitive crowded world of 
magazines knows success can be fleeting im anxietyridden 
she says 
the figures for july are that just 70 percent to 75 percent of 
the 600000 copies are expected to sell but publisher julie 
lewitnirenberg noted that summer is traditionally slow for 
magazines and that the first issue sold for 1 compared to the 
295 buyers now must fork out 
she said the number of advertising pages dropped from 123 in 
june to 85 in july and 50 in august but the september issue just 
closed for printing with 149 advertising pages 
ms mirabella says she knows there are pitfalls we have to 
keep our eye on the reader we think we have where her head is and 
how she sees us the reader we have is an intelligent reader 
selective in her view and selective in her eye 
fashion designer pearl nipon knows who that reader is i think 
its our customer mirabella she says is fabulous its so 
understandable it is so today and she intends to continue to 
buy advertising in the magazine 
patti cohen fashion director for donna karan agrees its 
really very exciting i dont think it takes readers from other 
magazines i want to read mirabella but i also want to read the 
vogues and the elles 
by targeting a narrowly defined audience of welleducated older 
and affluent women mirabella has a chance of surviving in the 
crowded fashion magazine market said joseph ostrow worldwide 
media director of foote cone and belding an ad agency in new york 
but a good six months will have to pass before any meaningful 
judgment can be passed on the publication said nancy smith senior 
vice president of media services at young amp rubicam inc another 
new york ad agency 
the money and backing of communications magnate rupert murdoch 
bode well for mirabella as does the fact that ms mirabella is the 
creative force behind it ms smith said she is an extremely 
talented woman who has demonstrated her strength before 
ms mirabella was vogues editorinchief for 17 years before 
she was abruptly dismissed last june by si newhouse jr of conde 
nast in november murdoch approached her about presiding over a 
monthly bearing her name 
the glossy oversized publication has some features that can 
hardly be considered intelligent reading material one article in 
the june issue describes the favorite lipstick colors of actress 
joan collins designer caroline herrera and jewelry designer paloma

the iowa civil liberties union says it 
is drafting a proposed amendment to iowas constitution that would 
ensure the right to abortion 
iowa is a state with a longstanding tradition of respect for 
individual rights of privacy iclu executive director cryss 
farley said in a statement distributed monday our constitution 
should provide express protection for that concept 
ms farley said the iclu is drafting a proposed amendment that 
will simply protect the status quo in the wake of a us supreme 
court ruling broadening state powers to restrict abortions 
it is clear that we can no longer rely upon the us supreme 
court to protect the right of reproductive choice ms farley 
said 
iowa house speaker don avenson said he doesnt expect the 
legislature to approve abortion restrictions next year 
the national organization for women called sunday for an 
amendment to the united states constitution guaranteeing women the 
right to abortion and birth control now issued its call for a 
bill of rights for the 21st century at a convention in 
cincinnati 
the proposed constitutional amendment in iowa which has yet to 
be drafted would require the approval of two successive general 
assemblies before being submitted to a statewide vote 
this will be a moderate proposal aimed at preserving 
established privacy rights said iclu lobbyist mark lambert

would grant television licenses for two private networks breaking 
the states monopoly

antennatv made up of representatives from greeces diverse and

wages salaries and other benefits rose 45 
percent in the 12 months ending in june the labor department said 
tuesday in a report viewed by some economists as a hopeful sign 
that inflationary wage pressures may be peaking 
the departments employment cost index measures movements in 
labor costs over the preceding 12 months for the 12 months ending 
in march the last time the index was issued the increase was 46 
percent that figure was down from a 49 percent increase in the 12 
months ending in december 
to some analysts the two quarters of slightly slower 
compensation increases showed that labor costs are beginning to 
moderate in the face of a slowing economy 
the unemployment rate which dropped to a 15year low of 5 
percent in march has been climbing and now stands at 53 percent 
many economists are expecting the jobless figure to hit 6 percent 
by early next year reflecting lackluster econmic growth in the 
second half of 1989 
this rising jobless rate will ease tight labor markets and help 
alleviate inflationary pressures in the economy these analysts 
believe 
the employment cost index shows that the upward momentum in 
wages has ceased and is beginning to fade said allen sinai 
chief economist for the boston co 
in a separate government report tuesday the labor department 
said that major collective bargaining settlements concluded in the 
first six months of this year featured average wage increases of 
37 percent in the first year of the contract up from 21 percent 
firstyear increases the last time these contracts were negotiated 
robert dederick chief economist at northern trust co of 
chicago said collective bargaining settlements are higher than 
they were two to three years ago but that they have not jumped 
sharply in recent months 
wage increases stopped strengthening toward the fall of last 
year he said we have a capping of wage increases with the 
business slowdown that began earlier this year 
since employment costs account for close to 70 percent of total 
costs on the industrial side of the economy any hint of rising 
wage pressures fuels concerns about the onset of a new inflationary 
spiral 
for that reason the signs of some wage moderation were seen as 
encouraging indications that the federal reserve will succeed in 
its efforts to tame inflation without pitching the economy into a 
recession 
the 45 percent increase in compensation costs for the 12 months 
ending in june includes wages and salaries and the costs for such 
employee benefits as health insurance 
the wage and salary component of total compensation climbed by 
41 percent over the past year while benefit costs rose a faster 
56 percent 
workers in the service sector of the economy fared better than 
the manufacturing sector in pay gains service industries saw wages 
and salaries increase 47 percent in the past 12 months compared to 
a 32 percent rise for the manufacturing sector 
however there was a wide split in the services category at the 
low end of the increases wages in the transportation sector and 
communications industry rose just 19 percent while wages at 
hospitals shot up 64 percent wages climbed an even faster 76 
percent in finance insurance and real estate but this increase 
was influenced by earnings on commissions which can be volatile 
from quarter to quarter

efforts by congress to force communities into 
cleanups they cant afford just wont work and are a cheap 
substitute for a real environmental policy a spokesman for the 
nations mayors told senators tuesday 
you cannot build treatment plants with a thousand points 
of light john bullard told a joint session of the environment 
and public works subcommittees on environmental protection and on 
superfund ocean and water protection 
bullard mayor of new bedford mass was representing the 
national league of cities before the subcommittees which are 
considering a variety of clean water legislation 
bullard said the federal government must be able to walk this 
fine line between punishment and partnership if it is to be 
serious about environmental issues 
he said an irresistible force of public demand for a clean 
environment is running up against an immovable object of scarce 
financial resources that threatens an impending explosion that 
could consume some cities 
for example he said his own city is working under a consent 
decree in which it is supposed to spend 560 million on various 
clean water projects to meet federal standards 
the only problem he said is that the figure works out to 
5600 per man woman and child in the city of 100000 he said the 
city with a total annual budget of 116 million is doing good to 
handle its 22 million total indebtness and has never built a 
project that cost more than 15 million that one a dam with help 
from the army corps of engineers 
he pointed out that congress has authorized 12 billion in 
federal spending since 1984 on a single section of the clean water 
act yet has actually appropriated only 9251 million 
it appears to us that the federal government has poorly 
managed its own fiscal affairs and cannot seem to put them back in 
order he said what is happening now appears to us to be an 
attempt to continue business as usual merely shifting the 
financing responsibility to other levels of governmnent the end 
result will be that all our fiscal houses will be in total 
disarray 
bullard was among a number of government officials and private 
researchers to testify before the two subcommittees tuesdays 
hearing was not on any one of them but rather was organized to 
enable a variety of public and private groups to present their 
general views

the democraticcontrolled house today cut 
president bushs request for star wars spending in next years 
defense budget by nearly 2 billion 
by a vote of 248175 the house approved an amendment that cut 
700 million from the program in addition to the 11 billion the 
house armed services committee had cut last month 
bush had proposed spending 49 billion for the program in the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 and made a personal plea on behalf of 
the program at a white house meeting on monday the house 
recommended spending of 31 billion 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked if bush 
would veto a bill that cuts money for star wars 
were a long way from considering vetos were talking now 
about winning not about vetos he said 
the action came in a series of roll call votes as the house 
worked its way through the annual defense blueprint the senate was 
debating its own version 
the house rejected one proposal for a deeper cut and a second 
amendment that would have restored all but 300 million to the 
administrations request 
if we value americas security ban star wars rep les 
aucoin dore said earlier in the debate 
rep jon l kyl rariz lost 299117 in his effort to set 
spending for the program at 41 billion 300 million below 
bushs request it is much better to build shields than to build 
swords kyl argued 
an amendment that would have limited spending on star wars 
formally known as the strategic defense initiative to 13 billion 
failed by a vote of 286137 
republican rep john rowland of connecticut attributed the 
administrations defeat on star wars to the emphasis it has put on 
lobbying for the b2 bomber 
they focused hard on this issue rowland said referring to 
the bomber they got creamed on sdi 
following the series of votes the house considered a number of 
amendments to use the money diverted from sdi for conventional 
forces environmental cleanup and military drug interdiction 
the annual defense debate opened in both congressional chambers 
monday with the senate adding money to speed production of such 
conventional combat weapons as the stinger and tow missiles 
voting 910 senators added 9336 million for missile 
production over the next two fiscal years after sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee contended 
that stretching out acquisition would be militarily unwise and 
economically sound 
on the stealth bomber nunn and sen john warner rva the 
panels ranking gop member offered an amendment to prohibit buying 
large numbers of the aircraft until prototypes meet strict flight 
and radarevasion tests it would reduce bushs spending request 
for 47 billion for the b2 by 300 million 
warner said that imposing a flybeforebuy standard is a 
prudent step before the united states makes the costly decision to 
produce the batwinged aircraft 
the house armed services committee made deep cuts in the b2 
program slashing 800 million from the bush request and is to 
consider amendments wednesday to end the program altogether or 
place strict limits on further funding 
bush is appealing to lawmakers in both chambers to hold the 
spending line on both the b2 and star wars 
meanwhile sen pete wilson rcalif called on bush to veto 
the defense bill if the house makes deep cuts in the star wars 
program 
bush is encountering resistance on the b2 because of its high 
cost estimated at 70 billion for 132 bombers or 530 million 
each 
the president is attempting to deflect the argument away from 
the price tag by framing it in terms of the flexibility needed to 
bring success in arms control talks with the soviet union

gov bob martinez saying the unborn 
deserve our help and protection today called a special 
legislative session to address the abortion issue 
martinez who favors more restrictions on abortion called for 
the special session three weeks after the us supreme court threw 
the issue back to the states in a 54 decision on a missouri case 
the court has given states the opportunity to better balance 
the rights of the unborn with those of women and i believe florida 
should do more to protect unborn children who cannot speak for 
themselves martinez said in a statement 
this is an issue of fundamental rights and i believe the 
unborn deserve our help and our protection 
the governor however isnt expected to offer specific 
legislation for the session to be held oct 1013 
the florida legislature appears evenly divided on the issue but 
many lawmakers would rather leave the controversial subject alone 
senate president bob crawford said the abortion issue could 
create such bitter feelings among lawmakers that other critical 
needs of the state could suffer 
there are many issues that are very important and we need to 
continue working on other issues and not be paralyzed just dealing 
with the emotions of this issue crawford said after the 
governors announcement 
earlier this month speaker tom gustafson named a prochoice 
lawmaker elaine gordon of north miami to put together the houses 
abortion proposal for a special session 
ms gordon a democrat chairs the house health care committee 
current florida law allows abortons during the first six months 
of pregnancy a woman must have permission from two doctors based 
on health reasons to acquire an abortion in the last trimester of 
pregnancy

the leader of the american society of 
newspaper editors returned to his desk tuesday both encouraged and 
discouraged by his trip to urge executives of two dozen newspapers 
to hire more minority people 
loren ghiglione asne president and editor of the southbridge 
mass news said he found some papers attached no especial 
importance to the question of whether they cover their communities 
with a staff composed entirely of white reporters and editors 
others he said showed a commitment to finding minority 
youngsters and bringing them along for years until they are 
prepared to join news staffs as fulltime reporters 
ghiglione set out july 3 on a mainetocalifornia trip during 
which he met more than 100 editors and other newspaper executives 
before he left he said feared that the newspaper industrys 
commitment to integrating its newsrooms had taken a back seat to 
business matters and that the goal was threatened by apathy 
asne surveys have found that 54 percent of newspapers have no 
minority news people on their news staffs or at the top most of 
them are small papers 
all told minorities account for 75 percent of all newsroom 
professionals the most recent survey found 
ghiglione said he found a longterm commitment at some papers he 
cited the albuquerque nm journal in an area with a significant 
hispanic and indian population where editors are determined to 
have 40 percent to 45 percent minority staffing by the turn of the 
century 
the journal not only takes on young minority people as interns 
it keeps in touch with them takes them back summer after summer 
follows them through college and retains them as interns until they 
are prepared to take their place on the papers staff ghiglione 
said 
on the other hand he said he sometimes encountered 
indifference at other papers 
i guess people were too polite to be angry or hostile he 
said but what i sensed at several places was a feeling that 
while this is a noble cause it is very low priority while were 
trying to get the paper out every day if a qualified minority 
candidate came through the door we would consider hiring him if we 
had an opening but recruitment requires more effort more time and 
more money than we are willing to give 
ghiglione said he now assigns increased importance to focusing 
on junior and senior high school students and encouraging writing 
and work on school newspapers 
he said he intends to follow up his trip with letters and calls 
to the owners of groups of newspapers that dont stress minority 
hiring 
im going to go to the heads of many of the dailies i visited 
and ask for their help he said an awful lot of companies have 
not put it on their priority list

orders for bigticket factory goods rose a 
modest 03 percent in june the government said tuesday in a report 
seen as evidence that manufacturing although sluggish isnt 
crumbling 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
ranging from bicycles to battleships advanced to a seasonally 
adjusted 1241 billion last month that followed a 44 percent 
decline in may the sharpest in 10 months 
this is basically in line with the forecast of modest growth 
but no recession said economist michael k evans who heads a 
consulting firm in washington 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
said the report likely means the federal reserve wont be in a rush 
to cut interest rates soon 
the report could have triggered action if it was really weak 
but it wasnt it suggests were continuing to tread water in 
manufacturing but the sector isnt crumbling he said 
the fed recently shifted gears after a yearlong campaign of 
fighting inflation with higher interest rates allowing two small 
declines in shortterm rates since early june most analysts expect 
the central bank to continue nudging rates lower but slowly and 
cautiously 
other statistics released tuesday generally confirmed 
economists views that inflation isnt getting worse and growth is 
holding up although at a lackluster rate 
wages salaries and other benefits paid to american workers rose 
45 percent in the 12 months ending in june down just slightly 
from the 46 percent gain in the 12 months ending in march 
according to the labor departments employment cost index 
in its quarterly report on collective bargaining agreements the 
labor department said major contracts signed by labor unions in the 
apriljune period provided firstyear raises of 39 percent up 
from 32 percent in the first quarter 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes rebounded 59 percent in june to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 34 million units it was the first 
increase in six months and a sign that falling mortgage rates have 
begun to stimulate the depressed housing sector 
the rebound in durable goods orders was powered by a 158 
percent jump in military orders to a seasonally adjusted 88 
billion the highly volatile category registered drops of 114 
percent in may and 183 percent in april 
excluding defense new orders fell 07 percent last month 
following a decline of 39 percent in may the june activity was 
depressed by softness in auto manufacturing which offset an upturn 
at factories producing machinery 
the closely watched category of nondefense capital goods a 
barometer of business investment plans rose 05 percent in june to 
375 billion following a 77 percent plunge a month earlier 
nonelectrical machinery orders rose 37 percent to 231 
billion reflecting an increase in purchases of steam engines and 
turbines 
electrical machinery gained 28 percent to 192 billion 
following a 61 percent drop in may 
transportation equipment declined 35 percent to 323 billion 
following a 97 percent drop a month earlier most of the decline 
came in shipbuilding and in motor vehicles and parts 
primary metals including steel were off 5 percent to 12 
billion following a 18 percent decline in may evans said much of 
the decline represents lower steel prices rather than less volume 
for the first six months of the year new orders for durable 
goods totaled 7551 billion 82 percent higher than the first 
half of 1988 the figure does not take inflation into account 
shipments of durable goods fell 11 percent to 1216 billion in 
june following a 03 percent decline in may

iranian newspapers called tuesday for a 
big voter turnout in presidential elections friday to confound the 
islamic republics critics and open a new chapter after 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death 
all predicted a landslide victory for the only real candidate 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who has emerged as irans 
strongman since the june 3 death of khomeini the revolutionary 
patriarch who founded the fundamentalist state 
rafsanjanis only challenger is abass sheibani 58 a 
frenchtrained physician and parliament deputy with no national 
political base 
it can be said beyond any doubt that mr rafsanjani is the 
best choice for the post said the tehran times an 
englighlanguage daily that supports rafsanjani 
he has the qualifications and his realistic approach to 
domestic regional and international issues is known to all 
the radical abrar daily said massive participation by irans 
estimated 25 million voters is vital because world oppressors 
have been trying to portray the islamic republic as unstable and 
unable to last since khomeini died 
jomhuri islami another radical daily stressed that each vote 
is a bullet fired at the heart of irans enemies 
the election will be held alongside a national referendum on 
proposed constitutional reforms to give the presidency greater 
powers and eliminate competing power centers that have paralyzed 
government for years reforms propose scrapping the post of prime 
minister and making the president head of government 
the tehran times said june 28 will go down in the history of 
the islamic republic as one of the most important events 
because the nation will have a president with the power needed to 
tackle the issues 
newspapers were so confident rafsanjani will win that they have 
been speculating on the formation of his cabinet when he succeeds 
twoterm incumbent ayatollah ali khamanei 
khamenei was elected to succeed khomeini as irans supreme 
religious leader last month and was to step down when his second 
term expired oct 5 but elections were advanced three weeks to 
speed up the transition of power after khomeini died 
diplomatic sources and western analysts say rafsanjani 55 is 
expected to name a team dominated by technocrats and give priority 
to reviving irans economy after a decade of mismanagement poor 
planning and an eightyear war with iraq 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans pragmatist faction also is 
expected to neutralize his radical rivals by giving them positions 
although probably with reduced powers 
the tehran times said rafsanjani personally will take charge of 
the planning and budget ministry in his drive to revitalize a 
materialsstarved industry operating at only 30 percent to 40 
percent of capacity and map out a muchdelayed longterm economic 
strategy to reduce runaway inflation and unemployment in the 
postwar era

drugs agrees that crack is worse than taxes but he isnt ready 
to call for a tax increase to pay for the fight bushs spokesman 
said today the president doesnt support such a boost either 
maybe down the road we will william j bennett said after a 
closed meeting with leaders of the us conference of mayors on 
monday but i think there are other choices 
bush pledged during his election campaign that he would not 
support new taxes and press secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
that the president remains opposed to raising taxes for any 
purpose 
fitzwater said there were practical problems with proposals 
suggested by some in congress to sell federal bonds to pay for the 
drug war 
he said the president believed that if more money is needed it 
should be obtained through the more traditional route of a 
congressional appropriation or a shift of money from other programs 
but some mayors who met monday with bennett said citizens will 
support new taxes if the money is used to fight drugs 
most of us have had to raise taxes in our local communities 
already to deal with the drug problem so were not afraid to 
recommend that said houston mayor kathryn whitmire president of 
the conference 
the people are ready to accept an increase in taxes if they 
knew that the taxes were going solely to interdict drugs and not 
for some social program which they may or may not agree with 
said new york city mayor ed koch 
koch said the slogan crack is worse than taxes means that 
people will pay to have this monster lifted from their shoulders so 
their kids can be protected 
the mayors met with bennett director of the office of national 
drug control policy to push a 16point plan they want included in 
the strategy he is to produce by sept 5 one point calls for 
increased funding for state and local programs 
boston mayor raymond flynn called for 3 billion in federal 
funds to be distributed to states and cities to fight the drug war 
and he complained that bennett remained vague on the money issue 
this is a lot of baloney whats going on here flynn said 
in an interview unless theyre willing to put real dollars on 
the line theyre not sincere in the war on drugs 
flynn said he asked bennett whether he would support the 3 
billion appropriation and was told it depends on what congress 
does 
bennett agreed that some funds should come from the federal 
government but he would not give a figure 
mayors always ask for more he said 
two california republicans sen pete wilson and rep jerry 
lewis introduced legislation last week to sell 4 billion worth of 
savings bonds to raise money to fight the drug war sen bob 
graham dfla said monday he was offering a similar bill 
despite the differences whitmire described the meeting as a 
very good dialogue even washington mayor marion barry whose 
relationship with bennett has been cool called it a great 
meeting 
the other mayors at the meeting were robert isaac colorado 
springs colo joseph riley charleston sc richard berkley 
kansas city mo arthur holland trenton nj wilson goode 
philadelphia william hudnut indianapolis jerry abramson

congress should not give money to an 
independent board that is working to develop a national voluntary 
teacher certification system education secretary lauro cavazos 
said tuesday 
however cavazos said the bush administration supports the goals 
of the national board for professional teaching standards which 
plans to start offering the certificates in 1993 to qualified 
applicants who make it through a rigorous evaluation process 
board members believe their plan ultimately will upgrade teacher 
training and the profession in general open doors to new roles and 
possibly higher pay for certified teachers and improve the 
learning environment for children 
the board currently operates with total independence from the 
federal government and that in my judgment is the way it ought 
to remain cavazos told the house education and labor 
subcommittee on postsecondary education 
the 63member board made up of teachers other educators 
government officials and prominent business leaders is asking for 
25 million from congress to help fund its research into standards 
and assessment methods business executives have said they will 
match that amount but cannot hope to raise more 
these private leaders say they consider it imperative that our 
national government provide a onetime appropriation of 25 million 
that the private sector will match said board chairman james 
hunt a former governor of north carolina 
in a statement submitted to the panel hunt said anything less 
than 50 million would result in piecemeal reform rather than the 
broad effort needed to help the board do the job right 
cavazos cited three major concerns the board lacks 
accountability to the education secretary the money requested is 
excessive and would likely duplicate department research and the 
department opposes solesource contracts awarded without 
competition 
rep bill goodling rpa said he could think of better ways to 
use 25 million if the objective is to attract more and better 
teachers we should put our priorities in order he said 
adding he would prefer to see the money used to forgive loans for 
students who agree to teach in poor areas 
but others on the subcommittee said they wanted to find a middle 
ground 
these people want to do something for this country and i dont 
want to turn them off said rep thomas coleman rmo 
he suggested that the board itself award research grants 
competitively and submit to oversight by congress and the 
department he also said the 25 million if deemed excessive 
could be reduced 
subcommittee chairman pat williams dmont said colemans 
suggestions appeared to offer some room here for some type of a 
coming together is there room to work with the 
administration 
cavazos said he would enter into discussions with an open mind 
but he said he could not support the request as currently 
structured and invited the board to apply for money on the same 
competitive basis that other federal grants are awarded 
witnesses for the american association of school administrators 
and the council of chief state school officers said they favored 
the federal appropriation as long as the board required competitive 
bidding and peer reviews for research contracts and the 25 million 
did not come from other federal education programs 
the senate labor and human resources committee has approved the 
boards 25 million request as part of an omnibus education bill 
that also includes president bushs proposals for several new 
education programs the bill is expected to come to the floor in 
september

gunfire broke out in somalias capital 
near the home of the ousted defense minister who was detained this 
week on charges of plotting against the government sources said 
tuesday 
also tuesday a human rights group said housetohouse searches 
and detentions continued in mogadishu the somali capital nearly 
two weeks after deadly clashes between moslem worshipers and somali 
soldiers 
the brief outburst of shooting started monday apparently when 
soldiers went to search the home of former defense minister aden 
abdullahi nur according to a resident who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he did not know if there were casualties 
nur was stripped of his defense portfolio in a cabinet shakeup 
this year and remained ministerwithoutportfolio in the office of 
autocratic president mohamed siad barre 
he and a fellow ministerwithoutportfolio mohammed abdulleh 
baadleh were arrested monday and accused of plotting against the 
state according to mogadishu sources baadleh had been minister 
of interior until the cabinet shuffle 
staterun mogadishu radio announced monday the two are accused 
of acts which threatened the sovereignty unity and security and 
togetherness of the large community of the somali people 
the broadcast monitored in neighboring kenya said prosecutors 
are investigating the ministers the broadcast did not say they 
were arrested 
nur is a member of somalias ogadeni clan which reportedly has 
been feuding with the govenment in central and southern somalia 
the horn of africa nations 6 million people all belong to the 
somali tribe which is divided into half a dozen major clans siad 
barre belongs to the marehan clan 
it is not clear whether the charges against nur and baadleh are 
related to july 14 riots when security forces opened fire on moslem 
worshipers in mogadishu the human rights group africa watch said 
troops killed as many as 400 civilians the government put the toll 
at 23 
africa watch in a statement sent by telex to nairobi claimed 
tuesday that arrests and housetohouse searches that followed and 
in which at least 2000 people have been arrested continue in 
mogadishu although on a reduced scale 
troops still are enforcing a 9 pm to 5 am curfew relaxed 
from a dawntodusk curfew imposed july 14 residents said 
the violence erupted after the july 13 arrests of four moslem 
leaders and an unspecified number of civilians according to africa 
watch which has offices in london and washington islam is the 
state religion of the impoverished pastoral nation 
the claims are difficult to assess as the government has refused 
to allow western journalists into the country since heavy fighting 
broke out between government forces and the northern rebel somali 
national movement in may 1988 
siad barre has ruled somalia as a oneparty state since 1969 and 
has battled the northern rebels since 1981

testimony about a doctored bank document 
intensified the furor over mayor tom bradleys financial dealings 
and prompted a longtime supporter to raise the possibility of the 
mayors resignation 
bradley who was elected this year to a fifth term faces 
criticism for his personal financial affairs including taking 
consulting fees from a bank that had dealings with the city and 
serving on the board of a savings and loan 
bradley should consider resigning if he is found to have 
influenced city decisions to deposit money in far east national 
bank councilwoman joan milke flores long a supporter of the 
mayor said after a council committee meeting monday 
if he cant explain away any of this he is going to have to 
assess his effectiveness in running the city ms flores told the 
los angeles times she added however that she was not 
recommending that bradley quit 
bradley today insisted that he wouldnt resign and said he 
didnt know why the phrase per the mayor was blotted out on a 
worksheet detailing a 2 million investment of city funds 
questioned by reporters after a city hall news conference on 
another matter bradley said to anyone who has any such 
thoughts ill be around here four years from now as mayor of this 
city 
officials testifying before the councils budget committee 
revealed monday that the notation per the mayor was removed 
from a bid document from far east and replaced with that of the 
city treasurer leonard rittenberg 
the change was made to a document dated march 23 one day after 
the bank was given 2 million in city deposits without going 
through the usual competitive bidding process the council panel 
was told monday 
per the mayor had been written under a section on the 
document reporting the deposits but was changed to read per 
leonard rittenberg said edward corser head of the chief 
administrative offices audit and management division 
bradleys name was blacked out with a marking pen then covered 
with typewriter correction fluid and replaced with the treasurers 
corser said 
an audit released by corsers office last week concluded that 
rittenberg ordered the deposits only a day after bradley asked the 
treasurer about the citys relationship with the bank 
the audit also found that rittenberg had tried to cover up the 
transaction by creating documents that purported to show other 
banks competing for the deposits 
bradley refused to comment on the latest developments deputy 
mayor mike gage denied that bradley exerted influence on far easts 
behalf 
gage said the mayor immediately returned his 18000 advisers 
fee from far east after learning from his march 22 conversation 
with rittenberg of the banks dealings with the city 
rittenberg told the committee the original reference to bradley 
on the document was simply a mistake made by one of his 
subordinates 
this is a worksheet rittenberg said of the document 
quite often things are written on them and whited out crossed 
out 
nowhere did i instruct or tell my staff to make those 
placements per the mayor rittenberg testified 
corser testified that the document was altered after rittenberg 
informed aides that bradleys ties to the bank were being examined 
by reporters 
bradleys financial dealings with far east and with valley 
federal savings amp loan which paid him 24000 a year as a board 
member until he resigned earlier this year are the subject of 
investigations by the city attorney the city controller and 
federal banking authorities

nothing in the united airlines dc10 crash at 
sioux city iowa indicates that other dc10s are unsafe or that 
anything more now needs to be done to make them safer 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said tuesday 
skinner defended a declaration by new federal aviation 
administration head james busey that the dc10 is a safe aircraft 
even though the cause of the crash wednesday that killed 111 people 
has not been determined 
investigators are focusing on evidence that the triplejets 
tail engine blew up disabling its hydraulic steering system but 
they have offered no explanation for the explosive engine failure 
transportation department experts have been made available for 
the crash investigation skinner told a news conference but 
nothing has been indicated to us that we should do anything were 
not doing 
he said the decision to affirm that the dc10 is safe is based 
on the aircrafts record its manufacturer douglas aircraft says 
dc10s have flown 745 million passengers 7 billion miles over two 
decades the airliner also has been in some of historys worst air 
disasters blamed on maintenance problems pilot error or a cargo 
door defect that has been corrected 
skinner said if the department said nothing about the dc10 it 
might imply that something was wrong 
nothing in the planes record indicates that it is either 
inherently unsafe or that anything needs to be done that hasnt 
been done he said 
if however evidence is uncovered during the national 
transportation safety boards investigation of the iowa crash that 
indicates a problem action will be taken skinner said 
the faa has the power to ground an airplane as it did with the 
dc10 after a 1979 chicago crash that killed 275 people and was 
later blamed on a faulty maintenance procedure by american airlines 
it also issues airworthiness directives that require work on 
airliners within a set period of time when a problem is found 
skinner in a statement he said was not related to the crash of 
the 15yearold united dc10 also said the department is 
continuing to study how to keep aging airliners free of problems 
including corrosion 
an industry study is expected within a few weeks that will 
recommend mandatory maintenance of dc10s and other mcdonnell 
douglasmanufactured models a similar study earlier this year 
recommended work on boeing airliners and most recommendatons in the 
study were later adopted by the faa as mandatory

delaware gov michael m castle called tuesday 
for stepped up education and treatment for substance abusers in 
prison as a means of relieving crowded conditions and making 
streets safer 
dealing with the inmates while they are in the institutions 
just might be the key to solving the prison crisis because sooner 
or later the overwhelming majority will be released castle told 
the senate judiciary committee 
he pointed to therapy programs to give inmates a more positive 
selfimage plus education and prevention programs and efforts to 
keep the prisons themselves drugfree 
castles comments came as sen joseph biden ddel opened 
hearings in advance of drug policy coordinator william bennetts 
scheduled sept 5 announcement of a strategy for waging war on drug 
abuse 
biden said his hearings would explore topics ranging from how to 
fund the war on drugs to how to fight it he said the problem of 
imprisoned substance abusers is serious and displayed a number of 
means by which drugs have been smuggled behind bars 
while cameras clicked biden took apart a womans shoe in which 
had been hidden what he described as a little ol green pill 
he also held up a jar of carrot baby food containing an orange bag 
with narcotics inside 
castle told the panel that the drug problem has dealt a blow 
to our overall criminal justice system 
our courts are clogged with extensive backlogs prosecution 
caseloads have doubled in many jurisdictions our police find 
themselves in many instances outmanned and outgunned in dealing 
with drug traffickers he said 
castle said he had signed into law a measure that would provide 
a minimum penalty of three years in prison for trafficking in no 
more than 5 grams of a narcotic substance he also said he recently 
agreed to build a new 600bed prison 
but the delaware governor said the number of arrests is so great 
that even before that prison is finished the state may be planning 
to construct a new one 
i am concerned that we have done too little to consider 
alternatives to hard time in maximum security institutions he 
said he said efforts should be made to head off the problems 
before they land in court 
in addition to therapy and drug abuse prevention programs 
castle called for vocational help and basic education for inmates 
he cited estimates that 75 percent are functionally illiterate when 
they enter and the vast majority still are when they leave it is 
essential that programs to teach reading and writing to the inmates 
be established he said 
castle also said sentencing alternative should be expanded 
certainly bigtime dealers must be dealt with in the harshest 
way possible he said but we also need effective ways to deal 
with the little fish we catch in our nets and i would argue that 
different approaches are necessary 
as an example he said courts should not punish the users of 
small amounts of drugs as we would those who are major 
traffickers

a dozen palestinians and 
israelis sat in a circle on a veranda overlooking biblical 
shepherds field engaging in blunt conversation they hope will 
change enmity to trust 
israeli army trucks rumbled past every few minutes lending 
urgency to the unofficial meeting at the apartment of ghassan 
andoni a physics professor at bir zeit university 
there is a silent majority in the israeli public that is not 
motivated by ideology but by its fears said andoni who had just 
been confined to a tent prison in the desert for 18 days for 
political activism this could change if we can win their trust 
an israeli musician named dany interrupted to say for 20 
years this land has been occupied by israel yet most israelis do 
not know palestinians and vice versa when they do meet it is in 
unequal situations like at a checkpoint 
dany who is in his 50s did not give his surname for fear his 
comments would threaten his job 
more than 30 such encounters have occurred in the past year 
between palestinians and israelis most of them intellectuals or 
professionals 
beit sahur a wealthy christian town of 10000 has been a focal 
point of nonviolent civil disobedience it is where the new 
testament says the birth of jesus was revealed to shepherds 
the informal meetings are unofficial accompaniment to talks 
between prominent palestinians and israeli officials including 
prime minister yitzhak shamir about holding elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip for palestinians to negotiate 
with israel 
exchanges between israeli leftists and palestine liberation 
organization officials have occurred abroad often in academic 
forums the future of such contacts depends on israels supreme 
court to which four leftists have appealed a law making contacts 
with the plo punishable by three years in jail 
on tuesday a palestinian lawyer known as a plo supporter said 
he had met with shamir a contradiction of government claims that 
the prime minister had spoken about his peace plan only with 
palestinians not connected with the plo 
in beit sahur hebrew university lecturer sidra ezrachi recalled 
that the conversation group organized a weekend visit by more than 
50 israelis to the arab town and the israelis brought children 
prayer books and kosher food palestinians later went to the 
israelis homes and attended synagogue services 
my kids were playing outside and i suddenly realized that i 
wasnt worried about them being here ms ezrachi said 
publicity however also brought two anonymous telephone from 
jewish extremists who threatened to kill her family 
members of the group try to break down each others stereotypes 
that has been difficult even painful especially when the 
conversation turns from personal to the political or from present 
to past 
at some point we stopped talking about history about who was 
right ms ezrachi said it was too painful 
andoni said palestinians as a result of the 19monthold 
uprising against israeli occupation now can approach israelis as 
equals and accept the idea of two states one for jews and one for 
arabs 
all the time we were trying to delegitimize the other side by 
saying zionism is racism that the existence of the jewish state 
was illegal he said in the same way israelis accused us of 
being terrorists disqualifying us from being a people or needing a 
state 
we realized that israelis are not going to disappear and they 
realized palestinians are not going to go away 
many israelis are reluctant to participate in such 
conversations feeling them inappropriate while the two peoples are 
in a state of war 
palestinians fear other palestinians will see their 
participation as acceptance of the status quo and also that 
israeli officials will try to cast them as substitutes for the plo 
in the territories 
israelis and palestinians in the beit sahur group have come to 
consider themselves friends but tensions linger 
andoni who noted with a chuckle that he read part of the jewish 
torah in jail said he was increasingly discouraged by public 
opinion polls indicating more hawkish israeli attitudes he also 
suffers doubt 
i always ask myself am i doing wrong speaking with my 
victimizers should i speak with the other side while they are 
killing our people he said 
after reflection andoni added until now though we still 
have the strength to forgive 
dany said hawkish israeli views stem from antiisraeli violence 
it is easy to pull to the extremes when you see what happened 
with the bus he said 
on july 6 a palestinian seized the steering wheel of an israeli 
commuter bus and forced it off the highway into a ravine killing 
16 jews twentyfive people were injured 
more than 520 palestinians have died in confrontations with 
israelis since the uprising began dec 8 1987 and 38 israelis 
have been killed

little league baseball announced tuesday a 
program to allow disabled children nationwide to play baseball and 
softball in a new division starting next year 
called the challenger division the program is aimed at 
youngsters aged 6 through 18 with physical and mental disabilities 
every child should have the cherished opportunity to wear a 
little league uniform and that is the goal of the challenger 
division said creighton j hale president of little league 
baseball we are simply extending the benefits of little league 
participation to disabled children and filling a void that has 
existed in their lives 
the program was unveiled at a news conference in the capitol 
office of senate minority leader bob dole rkan who served as 
chairman of a task force formed by little league baseball in 1988 
to develop the program 
one of childhoods most treasured experiences is little league 
baseball participation said dole who was an athlete in college 
before suffering disabling injuries in world war ii now 
every child can enjoy our great summer game and learn lessons that 
will last a lifetime 
the challenger division was inspired by baseball programs for 
the disabled that parents started in four cities the first of 
which began in brockton mass in 1985 a similar program was 
formed in bristol conn in 1986 with others now in spring texas 
and louisville ky 
i cant tell you the joy and pleasure and sheer rhapsody of 
these kids being able to participate in americas no 1 sport 
said sen john kerry dmass who served on the little league task 
force and has thrown out the opening baseball to start the summer 
league in brockton the past three years 
one of the organizers of the connecticut program ed beardsley 
and his 11yearold son david attended the ceremony david 
dressed in his uniform presented a book with team pictures to 
kerry 
tenyearold joe delarosa of spring texas who has spina 
bifida gave a baseball jersey and cap to the senator tuesday was 
joes birthday 
its been great said brenda delarosa his mother 
baseball has always been his favorite sport 
participants in the challenger division will play with the same 
equipment and on the same field as used in other little league 
games however hale said the rules are more flexible to allow 
local programs to tailor games to meet the needs and skills of 
participating youngsters 
the new division allows for a buddy system in which 
volunteers often players from other little league divisions can 
assist disabled players at bat and in the field for example a 
volunteer can push a wheelchairbound player around the base paths 
or help in retrieving balls 
hale did not know how many cities would establish programs for 
the disabled in the 1990 season but said a future goal is to have 
a world series championship for the challenger division

three of president bushs ambassadorial 
nominees accused by democrats of having no qualifications except 
political connections won narrow approval tuesday from the senate 
foreign relations committee 
with sen charles robb dva joining committee republicans 
the panel first voted 109 to send to the senate floor the 
nomination of florida real estate developer joseph zappala to be 
ambassador to spain 
then by voice votes it approved the equally controversial 
nominations of florida real estate developer marvin sembler to be 
ambassador to australia and della newman a seattle wash real 
estate broker to be ambassador to new zealand 
sen paul sarbanes dmd who led the fight against the 
nominees vowed to continue the battle on the senate floor 
one looks through this resume wondering why this person has 
been appointed to this position sarbanes said of zappala 
the answer is to be found in the appendix which lists the 
campaign contributions 
if we are going to reduce it to that we should put the office 
up for public auction and put the money in the treasury to reduce 
the deficit sarbanes said 
in other action the committee routinely gave its approval to the 
nomination of former child actress shirley temple black to be 
ambassador to czechoslovakia she won praise for her performance in 
a previous appointment as us ambassador to ghana 
it also approved thomas melady to be ambassador to the holy see 
william howard taft iv to be the permanent us representative on 
the council of the north atlantic treaty organization keith l 
brown to be ambassador to denmark and joseph gildenhorn a 
washington lawyer and real estate developer to be ambassador to 
switzerland 
gildenhorn and members of his immediate family have given nearly 
225000 to the republican national committee and state gop 
campaigns since 1984 
the american academy of diplomacy gave gildenhorn zappala 
sembler and newman unqualified ratings sarbanes said zappala 
and sembler each gave more than 100000 to republican causes and 
newman served as chairman of the washington state bush for 
president committee 
sarbanes also said 30 of the 44 ambassadors named thus far by 
bush have been political appointees not career ambassadors 
this 68 percent of political nominations far exceeds such 
appointments at a comparable point in previously elected 
administrations he said 
sending unqualified envoys insults the country involved 
demoralizes the professional foreign service and says to the world 
america is not serious about diplomacy sarbanes said would 
one for a moment consider nominating generals and admirals in the 
same fashion 
sen terry sanford dnc noted that although zappala is being 
sent to the preeminent spanishspeaking country in the world he 
does not speak spanish 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn said zappala sembler and newman 
will bring unique qualifications to their ambassadorships i 
believe they are indeed competent people who have achieved a great 
deal and are besides close friends of the president he said 
but sarbanes said the senate was given the power to reject 
presidential nominees in order to weed out cronies and unfit 
characters 
it matters who ambassadors are he said it is not enough 
to send a political appointee and hope he or she wont make 
mistakes

the pilot of united flight 232 said 
today that there was no procedure to handle the complete hydraulic 
failure that caused the plane to crash so the crew made it up as 
we went along 
capt al c haynes said the planes seasoned crew made the best 
of a bad situation and that he never worried about the plane 
crashing the crippled plane crashed while attempting to land at 
sioux gateway airport killing 111 of the 296 people aboard 
we have a lot of experience here and it showed up in the 
cockpit haynes 57 told reporters at a news conference shortly 
before his release from a hospital there is no substitute as 
far as i am concerned for experience 
haynes who has been a united pilot for 33 years was wheeled 
into the news conference in a wheelchair and gashes and bruises 
were visible on his face and neck however he said all of his 
stitches had been removed and he was in good health 
he declined to discuss last weeks crash in detail saying he 
wanted to wait until the national transportation safety board had 
completed its investigation however he briefly described the 
situation in the cabin as he first officer william r records and 
second officer dudley dvorak struggled to control the dc10 
after an explosion in the rear engine he said it became 
apparent that we had lost all of our hydraulics when i asked 
dudley what the procedure was he said we didnt have one so we 
made it up as we went along 
at the start of the news conference haynes thanked rescuers and 
the crew of the plane for their help in the disaster he also had a 
message for those who lost loved ones in the flight 
to the families and their friends i would like to say that 
this crew is dedicated to finding the cause of the this 
accident so that it may never happen again he said 
investigators have ordered another aerial search for key parts 
of flight 232s rear engine and planned to visit the general 
electric co plant where the engine was made 
members of an ntsb team said they expected to wrapup their work 
this week at the sioux gateway airport where the dc10 
crashedlanded last wednesday after its rear engine blew apart 
the death toll from the crash rose to 111 on monday of the 296 
people on board 185 survived including 10 of the 11 crew members 
more than 30 people remain hospitalized 
the investigation into the accident has been hampered because 
the rear engine one of three on the dc10 flew apart over farms 
in northwest iowa 
on monday teams searched a 16squaremile section of corn and 
soybean fields about 60 miles away from the crash site in hopes of 
finding missing pieces of the engine 
officials also used aircraft from the nebraska air national 
guard to take infrared photographs of the area and asked farmers 
working their fields to look for pieces of the engine 
while some debris was recovered key sections have yet to be 
found including a 400pound disk from the fan portion of the 
engine ntsb investigator robert macintosh said monday night 
officials ordered another round of aerial photography 
other investigators will travel to a general electric co plant 
in cincinnati where the rear engine was made 
they will be reviewing the manufacturing history and the 
manufacturing process said macintosh 
thus far investigators have found no evidence that foreign 
matter went into the rear engine he said 
workers cleared away large sections of rubble on monday 
allowing a portion of the airport that had been closed since the 
crash to reopen investigators are trying to reassemble the 
aircrafts tail section in an airport hangar 
the crew of the flight from denver to chicago reported they lost 
all three of the airplanes hydraulic systems immediately after the 
rear engine exploded macintosh said probers had found breaks in 
two of the systems and were still looking for a breach in the third 
meanwhile residents of this city on the eastern bank of the 
missouri river were beginning to assess the impact of the crash on 
their lives 
american red cross officials held a coping session monday 
night where psychiatrists met with those involved in the crash 
rescue operations 
its like a large group counseling session said red cross 
spokeswoman marsha pope this is kind of one last thing to bring 
some finality to it its been hard on everyone 
she said sleeplessness loss of appetite and other symptoms are 
typical reactions to stressful situations and those were involved 
need to be warned to expect those things 
those are normal reactions she said they dont need to 
think theyre going crazy 
already teams of counselors and psychiatrists were working with 
the hundreds of rescue workers many of whom found themselves 
working for days on end at the grisly crash scene 
you were asking a 20yearold who had never seen a body to 
walk through a cornfield littered with bodies said air force 
col robert ursano who was heading one of the teams

summer program on government and speech one that he attended about 
40 years ago 
the 157 students questioned meese on monday about the 
irancontra arms deals and former marine lt col oliver norths 
sentence 
meese 58 said he barely supported the arms sales to iran but 
in retrospect the idea was a good one i think the way it was 
put together was imperfect 
later he backtracked i would not recommend it be done but it 
was one of those highrisk things that you have to do sometimes 
he declined comment about norths sentence 
meese made an impression on the students 
he seemed easygoing and passive he was almost the complete 
opposite of what i expected said amanda walzer 16 of sherman 
oaks 
he had a warm personality said richard hsu 16 of torrance

hundreds of students upset by the government 
crackdown gathered this week to bang pots and sing mocking songs 
participants said in what appeared to be the first demonstration 
since the june 34 killings 
at least 300 beijing university students massed outside their 
dormitories sunday night to sing sarcastic renditions of patriotic 
songs and mourn those who died in the crackdown said participating 
students who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the students also said they were protesting that work units 
especially in government offices have rejected some graduating 
seniors assigned to work for them after expressing doubts about the 
students ideological purity 
after about an hour the students marched to the campus area 
where students had put up thousands of political posters during the 
spring democracy movement said the participants 
they said they sang and beat pots and pans in memory of 
classmates killed when government troops opened fire on protesters 
and their supporters 
officials have said nearly 200300 people died but chinese 
witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death toll may 
have been as high as 3000 
students at beijing university which has a long history of 
student activism were at the hub of the sixweek movement 
one student said some young teachers joined sundays protest and 
lighted firecrackers before the head of the schools communist 
party office ordered them all to go home 
the student said school officials are investigating those who 
participated in the twohour event but no one had been punished 
yet 
he said seniors the only ones left on campus feel oppressed by 
the monthlong ideological study classes they have been forced to 
attend in order to graduate 
no one dares to say what he really thinks we all have to tell 
lies he said 
the student said his classmates on sunday night sarcastically 
sang patriotic songs like without the communist party there 
would be no new china and repeatedly shouted long live the 
communist party 
no one seemed to know exactly how many students have been 
rejected by work units but a student said all but one of those 
assigned to the state security bureau have been rejected 
job assignments were made in the spring before the crackdown 
most college graduates are assigned jobs by the government 
one government employee speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he was told to investigate a beijing university student 
assigned to his work unit to see if he had been active in the 
student movement 
in the central province of anhui party officials fired a 
leading professor from government and party posts 
the official xinhua news agency said wen yuankai a professor at 
the science and technology university in hefei made speeches 
during the spring protests to urge students on 
xinhua said he was fired as deputy director of the provincial 
education commission and a member of the provincial party education 
group 
wen is among dozens of academics punished for supporting the 
student protests or making liberal statements 
a leading figure on the governments wanted list is the former 
vice president of wens university dissident fang lizhi he was 
fired from that post in 1987 amid accusations he incited an earlier 
round of student protests 
he is being sheltered at the us embassy in beijing where he 
took refuge during the crackdown

falling mortgage rates helped spur a 59 
percent rebound in existing homes sales last month after five 
months without a gain a real estate trade group said tuesday 
analysts said they expected continued improvement but cautioned 
that sluggish economic growth likely would prevent anything 
stronger than a modest resurgence 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
34 million units in june up from mays rate of 321 million units 
it was the first increase in sales since december 1988 and the 
largest increase since december 1986 when sales jumped 66 percent 
finally the existing home market responded to the decline in 
interest rates said economist richard peach of the mortgage 
bankers association of america who predicts modest improvement 
through the summer 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp fixedrate 
mortgages during june fell from 1048 percent to 1007 percent and 
have since edged down to 987 percent last week analysts expect a 
small additional drop 
however peach warned that fewer new jobs and lackluster 
economic growth overall will keep existing home sales near 34 
million units this year well below last years nineyear high of 
359 million units 
we dont think the underlying demand is strong enough to 
create much of a surge he said 
realtors president ira gribin said lower mortgage rates by 
making monthly payments more affordable spurred costconscious 
buyers in june to purchase moderatelypriced homes 
sales in the midwest where prices are lowest showed the 
sharpest increase while sales in the northeast where prices are 
the highest declined 
midwestern sales rose 185 percent to an annual rate of 960000 
units the highest level since december sales increased 52 
percent in the west to 610000 units and 41 percent in the south 
to 128 million units 
in the northeast however sales fell 98 percent to a rate of 
550000 units the lowest level since february 1985 
nationally the median sales price meaning half the homes sold 
for more and half for less was 93200 in june up 600 from may 
and 33 percent from a year earlier 
by region the median price was 149800 in the northeast up 
17 percent from a year ago 134100 in the west up 56 percent 
84900 in the south up 12 percent and 72100 in the midwest 
up 3 percent 
the housing market tends to march very closely on a regional 
basis with trends in employment growth said economist john 
hagens of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm 
in the northeast employment is stagnating because of high prices 
for houses there arent very many people unemployed to bring back 
to work and its very difficult to attract employees in from other 
parts of the country

two hungarian leaders to discuss reforms aimed at creating a 
society of free people in both countries the official tass news 
agency reported 
gorbachev met at the kremlin with karoly grosz general 
secretary of the hungarian communist party and rezsoe nyers who 
has described himself as first among equals in the reformist 
fourman presidium established in a power shuffle last month 
the two sides also discussed the withdrawal of soviet troops 
from hungary tass said in may the red army began the staged 
withdrawal of 10000 of its 62000 troops stationed in hungary 
grosz and nyers left moscow after the kremlin meeting tass 
reported

that accompanied the economic and political reforms launched since 
gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 next year hungary will hold 
its first multiparty elections since 1948 
nyers and grosz spoke about problems encountered in hungary 
during the search for ways of updating the socioecomomic political 
model of society tass said 
gorbachev noted the active quest in the socialist world for 
ways to achieve socialist revival to launch socialism onto a 
drastically higher orbit in the name of creating a society of free 
people masters of their lives and their countries tass said 
on saturday the first opposition candidate in more than 41 
years 35yearold pastor was elected in a local byelection to 
hungarys communist dominated government 
also tuesday hungarys communist party was reported to have 
asked a british company to help coach communist politicians in the 
art of public relations but the agency later denied any knowledge 
of such a plan 
the party daily nepszabadsag quoted an official as saying 
hungarian commmunists have asked the charles barker public 
relations ltd of london to assist the party in its facelifting 
campaign 
the agency on tuesday said it had no knowledge of such a request 
the partys rating in opinion polls has slipped in the past year 
despite its embrace of reforming policies and it is scrambling to

japans governing party took its first steps 
tuesday toward choosing a new leader after a big election setback 
while the socialists met with other opposition leaders on how to 
take advantage of their new strength 
setting up what was expected to be the first legislative 
showdown with the governing liberal democratic party leaders of 
the socialists and three other main opposition parties agreed to 
submit a bill to abolish the 3 percent sales tax 
the tax rammed through parliament by the liberal democrats late 
last year over an opposition boycott took effect april 1 and was 
seen as a key factor in the socialists major gains in sundays 
election for half the seats in parliaments upper house 
the socialists 67 seats leave them well short of a majority in 
the 252member house but conservative liberal democratic party 
now with 109 lost their majority for the first time in its 34year 
history 
they still have a commanding majority in the more powerful lower 
house but a legislative wrangle over the tax could increase 
pressure for new elections for the lower house before they are due 
in july 1990 
prime minister sousuke uno announced monday he will resign to 
take responsibility for the loss of 33 upper house seats 
liberal democratic leaders decided tuesday to set up a committee 
to discuss how their next party leader should be chosen a party 
official said 
the committee headed by seisuke okuno a nineterm member of 
the lower house will hold its first meeting thursday said the 
official who requested anonymity 
but with no clear successor in sight the selection is expected 
to take up to a month liberal democratic leaders have said they 
hope to fill the vacancy by midaugust in time for a new session of 
parliament which by law must convene within 30 days of an election 
the liberal democratic party still has a majority in the lower 
house which elects the prime minister 
the party is considering three methods of choosing its next 
president voting open to all party members an election open only 
to liberal democratic members of members of parliament and closed 
negotiations among party leaders 
the party is expected to opt for a vote among its legislators 
voting by all 4 million party members would take time to organize 
and closed negotiations likely would be criticized as undemocratic 
on tuesday party secretary general ryutaro hashimoto 
acknowleged there was some dissatisfaction among party members 
when party leaders selected uno to replace noboru takeshita 
takeshita head of the partys largest faction resigned to 
accept responsibility for a bribery scandal that tainted much of 
the liberal democratic elite in the scandal the recruit co a 
publishing conglomerate was accused of doling out millions of 
dollars of political donations and underpriced stocks to obtain 
favors 
before stepping down however takeshita virtually handpicked 
uno a colorless politician with no power base of his own but with 
no links to recruit 
soon after uno took office june 2 published reports alleged he 
had kept several paid mistresses including a geisha who later told 
her story on tv 
the new scandal outraged womens groups across the country 
after the recruit affair already had contributed to erosion of the 
liberal democrats popularity japanese farmers traditional 
supporters of the party were angered by moves to open japans farm 
product market wider to imports 
trading on japans stock market tuesday was bullish even though 
the election marked the first big defeat for the probusiness

the senate finance committee on tuesday 
approved the nomination of gwendolyn s king to head the social 
security administration and she promised efforts to improve the 
retirement and disability system 
mrs king whose nomination was approved by voice vote and sent 
to the full senate promised to reach out to the most vulnerable 
among those we serve and ensure for them the security that is our 
mission 
a fomer aide to attorney general dick thornburgh when he was 
governor of pennsylvania and to sen john heinz rpa mrs king 
said she would work to create a fairer more efficient and humane 
social security system 
the social security administration with an annual budget of 
230 billion currently provides 386 million people with monthly 
retirement disability or survivors benefits 
as part of a program to streamline and modernize its operations 
the agency pared its workforce by about 20 percent during the 
reagan administration years to about 65000 employees critics have 
complained of a drop in the quality of service to the public and of 
low employee morale 
john n sturdivant president of the american federation of 
government employees which represents 55000 social security 
employees said the union did not oppose mrs kings nomination and 
hoped to work with her to solve serious problems 
by all accounts both managers and rank and file employees are 
rapidly sinking under the burden of an evergrowing workload and 
the fact that they cannot service the public as it deserves to be 
served he said 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny expressed confidence mrs 
kings nomination would be approved and said the new administrator 
will take over an agency that has suffered from instability in 
leadership going through 10 administrators in the last 16 years 
moynihan said the new administrator will have to defend social 
securitys trust funds against use for deficit reduction or other 
government purposes and also will face low public confidence about 
the future of the benefits program 
social security is one of the greatest governmental success 
stories of the century but people dont believe it he said 
mrs king currently is an executive vice president of the 
washington government relations firm of gogol amp associates she 
would replace dorcas hardy who last month announced she would 
resign july 31 
the finance committee also approved by voice vote tuesday the 
nominations of linda m combs to be assistant treasury secretary 
for management thomas j duesterberg to be an assistant secretary 
of commerce and wade f horn to be chief of the childrens bureau 
in the department of health and human services

some people complain that all politicians 
are alike and in the salem city council race they may have a 
point 
even their own children sometimes have trouble distinguishing 
atlarge city council candidate jeanguy martineau from his 
identical twin ward 5 candidate jeanclaude martineau 
people are a bit confused jeanguy said tuesday 
jeanguy a city council member for 12 years holds the ward 5 
seat he and his brother didnt set out to make voters do a double 
take he said 
jeanguy is one of seven men running for four atlarge seats 
jeanclaude is among three candidates for the ward 5 seat vacated 
by his twin 
jeanclaude will be on the primary election ballot sept 26 if 
he survives that test he and his brother both will run in the 
general election in november 
city clerk josephine fusco says she sometimes has trouble 
identifying the 40yearold political pair 
theyre having a lot of fun with this she said theyre 
very close in fact when jeanclaude came in the other day i had to 
hesitate because i wasnt sure what i was going to call him 
the brothers wore the same hairdos crisp white shirts and dark 
blue ties tuesday sometimes answering questions in unison but 
they also exhibited a little sibling rivalry 
hes a little heavier than me jeanguy said 
i think its the other way around jeanclaude retorted 
jeanclaude the younger by 10 minutes was living in florida 
and returned to salem six months ago he said he decided to get 
into politics partly because his brothers constituents kept 
approaching him on the street 
he got all the complaints and i got off free half of the 
time jeanguy joked 
both brothers are republicans but they dont claim twin 
philosophies 
i think that were both very conservative jeanguy said 
jeanclaude is a little bit more compassionate than i am im 
more conservative looking at the issues and i try to be more 
realistic 
born jan 3 1949 the twins are the youngest of 12 children 
they grew up in salem and attended st joseph high school where 
they got their first taste of politics when jeanclaude beat out 
jeanguy for president of the freshman class 
i was always the clown in high school whereas jeanclaude was 
the more serious one jeanguy said 
after graduation jeanguy enlisted in the navy jeanclaude 
entered a catholic seminary but after five months he too joined 
the navy when both twins ships stopped in the philippines the 
brothers sometimes got into trouble jeanguy recalled 
no one would believe when i told them i wasnt from their 
ship he was a fire control technician and i was in communications 
so our rating patches were different and people would think we were 
out of uniform he said 
now jeanclaude works for standardthomson corp in waltham a 
manufacturer of thermostats for cars and airplanes and jeanguy is 
an engineer for the raytheon missile division in west andover 
mistakes in identity still happen 
when jeanclaude first returned from florida he ran a stop sign 
while driving in salem the policeman let him off believing he was 
council member jeanguy 
they should have given him a ticket in my opinion jeanguy 
said 
ms fusco the city clerk has a plan to cut down on the 
confusion if both are elected to the council theyll be assigned 
to the same seat every council meeting

the senate foreign relations committee 
approved on tuesday treaties with mexico the bahamas canada 
belgium thailand and the cayman islands providing for mutual 
cooperation in criminal investigations especially those dealing 
with narcotics trafficking 
the vote sending the treaties to the senate for ratification was 
162 
sen john kerry dmass said the treaties are of vital 
importance in forging cooperation to assist the united states in 
gathering evidence to prosecute narcotics cases 
but sen jesse helms rnc said they should not be approved 
by the committee or ratified by the senate because they might place 
americans in the situation of being prosecuted in foreign courts 
without full constitutional protections 
he also said the united states should not ratify such treaties 
with mexico or the bahamas because they have top legal officials 
suspected of corruption and involvement in protecting drug 
trafficking 
helms accused the bush administration of a massive coverup 
of information linking these officials to alleged narcotics 
corruption 
but kerry and other senators said the treaties are supported 
fully by the bush administration as a useful tool in the war on 
drugs 
they said the president and justice department retain the 
ability to deny frivolous requests by foreign governments and to 
protect the constitutional rights of americans

the agriculture department said tuesday that 
americans soon may be able to enjoy homegrown cocoa from puerto 
rico instead of relying entirely on foreign production 
cocoa the raw ingredient of chocolate was tried in the 1940s 
as a crop in puerto rico but failed because of disease and insect 
problems said agronomist edmundo rivera of the departments 
agricultural research service 
however he said in a report by the agency puerto rico has been 
free of black pod fungus the disease that threatens production in 
other areas but problems still persist including the ability of 
cocoa crops to tolerate acid soil and resist insect damage 
last year the united states imported more than 800 million 
worth of cocoa beans powder and cocoa butter the nations entire 
supply from brazil the main exporter and other producers 
including west africa central america and the dominican republic 
heber irizzary an agency horticulturist said cocoa can be an 
alternative crop that puerto rican farmers can grow on steep 
marginal soils or on land once used for sugar cane cane once a 
staple of the islands economy has become less profitable because 
of low yields higher costs of production and lower market prices 
irizzary and riveral who work at the usda agencys tropical 
crops and germplasm research laboratory in mayaguez for the past 
eight years have been studying cocoa hybrids from many countries in 
order to adapt them to puerto rico 
experimental trials of cocoa strains from costa rica in the 
early 1980s last year produced a yield potential of 3500 to 4000 
pounds per acre from sixyearold trees they said yields of 2000 
pounds per acre are considered marketable 
also the agency said cocoa from the test trees has been 
evaluated favorably by four of the largest us chocolate 
manufacturers 
rivera said cocoa would meet the need for crops in puerto rico 
that are suited to small family operations since it can be grown 
with a minimum amount of tillage and does not require expensive 
machinery

west german historians long rankled 
by the kremlins refusal to acknowledge the 1939 nonaggression 
pact that carved up eastern europe say moscows recognition of 
that prelude to world war ii could fuel baltic autonomy movements 
a historical falsehood is finally being erased and truth is 
being placed on the table wolfgang leonhard a west german 
author and soviet expert told the bonn newspaper bonner rundschau 
step by step the kremlin has moved toward officially conceding 
that oncesecret protocols to the 1939 agreement that divided 
poland and the baltic states between nazi germany and josef 
stalins soviet union 
a week after the nonaggression pact was signed on aug 23 
1939 germany invaded poland and set off world war ii the soviets 
seized latvia lithuania and estonia a year later 
the 1939 agreement known as the molotovribbentrop pact has 
become a major rallying point among activists in the baltic 
republics who are demanding greater autonomy from moscow 
on sunday night a highranking kremlin official stated he has 
no reason to doubt the existence of the secret clauses of the 1939 
pact signed by vyacheslav molotov of the soviet union and joachim 
von ribbentrop of germany 
there was a secret protocol valentin falin head of the 
international department of the communist partys central 
committee said in a discussion on west german television 
as far as the text is known it is a copy of a copy and the 
text corresponds to what was signed in reality falin said 
referring to a microfilm in west german archives 
kremlin officials had once maintained the microfilm may be a 
fake but soviet historians investigating baltic claims that their 
states were seized illegally traveled to bonn this year to examine 
the west german records 
soviet officials who accompanied president mikhail s gorbachev 
on his june visit to west germany also said the microfilm appeared 
to be an accurate record 
west german observers say falins statement is significant 
because it comes from a highranking communist party functionary 
who has previously adopted a hard line on the issue 
this is a stepbystep retreat by soviet officials said 
gerhard simon an expert on soviet affairs at the federal institute 
for eastern and international studies in cologne 
this is nothing revolutionary because we are talking about 
historical fact said reinhard meyers a muenster university 
professor 
but this is an official soviet seal of approval on whats 
been said for decades by historians said meyers who is among 
west germanys leading experts on the world war ii era 
while the deal between nazi germany and the soviet union has 
been in the western public domain for decades the official kremlin 
line until recently was that no proof of secret protocols existed 
we have been dealing with this extensively there have been a 
good number of new essays and books on the subject said simon 
the soviet news media have in recent months publicized some of 
the west german research efforts 
last month west german officials disclosed that soviet 
historians had inspected a microfilm copy of the secret protocols 
and other related documents that have been preserved in the bonn 
foreign ministry archives 
the soviets had to retreat simon said it became harder 
and harder for them to claim there was no secret protocol 
the tuesday editions of the bonner rundschau quoted leonhard 
also a historian as saying the pressure from reform forces was 
apparently so strong that now falin in his important position 
has also decided to make a statement 
simon says the evolution of moscows acknowledgement of stalins 
secret deal with hitler will likely bolster automony movements in 
the baltic republics 
i think this will help their momentum said simon

actor jim garner once described as the last 
real man in america could be an oddson favorite to be the next 
governor of california says a state senator who wants him to run 
everybody knows him said state sen herschel rosenthal who 
added that he approached garner but was rebuked 
he said im making 6 million a year what do i need that 
for or words to the effect rosenthal said monday 
garners publicist pat kingsley confirmed the informal 
proposal 
it is true in fact he was approached but he declined ms 
kingsley said he doesnt feel politics is the right field for 
him 
garner who was dubbed the last real man in america by 
people magazine has been active in environmental causes 
rosenthal said he sought out garner in part because the 
61yearold actor is immediately recognizable to much of the public 
thanks to his tv series maverick and the rockford files and 
movies that include murphys romance for which he received an 
academy award nomination 
garner also looks good on a horse said rosenthal noting that 
didnt hurt ronald reagan the former presidents first election 
victory was in the 1967 california gubernatorial race 
rosenthal said he began his search for a nonpolitician 
gubernatorial candidate after he decided that state attorney 
general john van de kamp and former san francisco mayor dianne 
feinstein among the democrats polls show voters favor could not 
beat republican us sen pete wilson in next years election 
wilson has declared himself a candidate for governor

a model who rappelled down mountains to 
project a manly image for winston cigarettes told congress tuesday 
he feels guilty about enticing youngsters to smoke and supports a 
bill to restrict tobacco advertising 
david goerlitz who portrayed a member of a searchandrescue 
team in a longrunning ad campaign said he considers himself an 
accessory to the systematic poisoning of our society 
i have had children tell me that they smoked winstons so that 
they could be just like me goerlitz told the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
for that i shall always feel guilty 
goerlitz described himself as a 25year threepackaday smoker 
who kicked the habit in november and now speaks out against smoking 
for the american cancer society american lung association and 
american heart association 
the legislation he endorsed would strip billboards and printed 
ads of everything but words and ban tobacco ads from all sports 
facilities the bill sponsored by rep thomas luken dohio is so 
broad that it would outlaw the names of cigarette brands painted on 
race cars 
the advertising industry said tuesday that the restrictions if 
enacted could cost thousands of jobs 
the freedom to advertise coalition released a study it 
commissioned saying that 62992 jobs mostly in printing 
publishing advertising and retail trade would be lost if the 
proposed restrictions become law 
publishers ad industry and tobacco industry groups also argued 
that imposing more restrictions would violate first amendment 
guarantees of free speech and wouldnt necessarily reduce the 
number of youngsters who take up smoking 
charles whitley spokesman for the tobacco institute said the 
legislation rests on the false premise that cigarette advertising 
is responsible for smoking by young people and that young people 
would not begin smoking if cigarette advertising were banned 
we are convinced that the measure would do nothing to reduce 
smoking among young people whitley testified in the name of 
protecting children the bill would eliminate from tobacco 
product advertising everything that makes it noticeable to adults 
bruce flye chairman of the national tobacco council said 
growers believe their product should be accorded the same 
reasonable advertising and promotional rights accorded any other 
legal commodity 
while protecting americas freedoms too many tobacco farm 
family members have fought bled and died in too many wars to 
stand idly by while the united states constitution is turned on its 
head he said 
a tobaccostate lawmaker rep robin tallon dsc said his 
constituents dont understand why washington denies them prayer in 
public school allows the burning of the us flag and persists in 
attacking the tobacco industry with punitive legislation 
he said people in his district complain its not what youre 
doing for them its what youre doing to them 
tallon also warned that the restrictions would set a bad 
precedent 
censorship is contagious he said 
congress passed a law in 1965 requiring the us surgeon 
generals warning about the hazards of smoking to be put on 
cigarette packages and ads the warnings began appearing in 1972 
after the tobacco industry and the federal trade commission reached 
an agreement on the wording 
luken said his bill is needed to eliminate hucksterism in the 
selling of a product that the surgeon general says kills 390000 
americans each year and is addictive in a way similar to drugs such 
as heroin and cocaine 
goerlitz said he was told young people were the intended market 
for the ads in which he was featured along with thenunknown actor 
corbin bernsen and other men 
when i modeled for winston i was told very clearly that young 
people were the market we were after he testified the other 
models and i were depicted as young and daring buddies and thats 
what young people relate to at 14 or 15 years old 
kids did not want to be construction workers any more they 
wanted to be heroes he said

john major a high school dropout who took over 
tuesday as britains foreign secretary personifies the 
transformation of the political establishment wrought by grocers 
daughter margaret thatcher 
the hierarchy of the governing conservative party once the 
preserve of bluebloods is increasingly dominated by gogetters 
of prime minister thatchers decade in power instinctive 
conservatives often from modest backgrounds 
mrs thatcher her administration slumping in popularity 
reinforced the grip of the selfmade successes of her 
freeenterprise revolution in a sweeping shakeup of her 22member 
cabinet on monday 
major was the most startling beneficiary 
the 46yearold son of a trapeze artist was raised in a tworoom 
apartment in south londons rundown brixton district he 
leapfrogged from the most junior cabinet post to one at the top of 
a cabinet that is far different from the one mrs thatcher 
appointed when she won power in 1979 
like her predecessor ted heath a carpenters son mrs 
thatcher at first surrounded herself with upperclass and benign 
conservative party luminaries many held views to the left of her 
own and many also believed she was a temporary phenomenon 
just three members of that first 23member cabinet including 
mrs thatcher had been educated at state high schools the rest 
were all graduates of the prestigious allboys boarding schools 
including six old etonians 
only two members of the new cabinet are from the playing fields 
of eton one nicholas ridley younger son of a viscount who she 
switched to trade and industry secretary from the politically 
sensitive environment ministry is deeply unpopular with 
rankandfile legislators the other lord belstead has an 
hereditary title and is party leader in the unelected house of 
lords 
just over half the cabinet members are people who like mrs 
thatcher made their way from state schools often to one of the 
ancient universities oxford or cambridge major and peter walker 
the secretary of state for wales didnt go to college at all 
they are characters in the mold of leslie titmuss the ambitious 
but flawed tory hero of john mortimers book and tv series 
paradise postponed 
the shift in the conservative party has brought sneers from both 
the lower and upper strata in this classconscious society that 
britain is now governed by garage owners and real estate agents 
putting new labels on bad wine doesnt improve the taste 
londons 3 millioncirculation daily mirror newspaper an 
opposition labor party supporter complained in an editorial 
tuesday this is still a government with an estateagent 
philosophy and an advertising agent mentality 
masscirculation rightwing newspapers hailed the changes 
particularly the sacking of transport secretary paul channon an 
impeccably mannered scion of the guinness brewing family who 
inherited a fortune in his 20s 
his department was accused of bungling bomb warnings in the 
aftermath of the pan am flight 103 air disaster over scotland dec 
21 and for an inept performance during current waves of public 
transportation strikes 
also shifted was the wellborn party chairman peter brooke son 
of a titled father he became northern ireland secretary and was 
replaced in the key votegarnering party post by kenneth baker an 
essentialy middleclass former education secretary 
the daily express dismissed ridley channon and brooke as 
patrician figures all personalities a million miles away from 
the populist dynamic party mrs thatcher has tried to create 
in 1979 mrs thatchers foreign secretary was in the classic 
mold for the job lord carrington sixth in line to a herditary 
baroncy heir to vast family estates 
her next foreign secretary francis pym also came from the 
wealthy landed gentry and sir geoffrey howe whom she eased out of 
the job this week comes from a family of welsh lawyers 
major who says he became a tory at 13 quit school at 16 to 
become a laborer on a construction site because his mother a 
onetime music hall singer needed the money after a stint of 
volunteer work in nigeria he made a career in banking 
his political vision is essentially pragmatic a lanky 
bespectacled figure with a classless accent he once cited being 
patient and being average as keys to political succees 
the first requirement of politics is not intellect or stamina 
but patience he said why should we leave politics to people 
who are abnormal or not average

estonian shipyard workers began a strike rooted in the restive 
baltic republics ethnic conflicts

signed a letter monday pledging more pay longer vacations and 
other benefits 
a document completed by negotiators saturday outlined the 
concessions most of the donetsk strikers remained off the job to 
demand guarantees and went back to the pits tuesday

estonia walked out to protest recent measures favoring the native 
population the official news agency tass reported it did not give

workers called the strike monday demanding cancellation of a 
language law and withdrawal of a proposed measure that would allow

transport and businesses in sukhumi capital of the abkhazia region

premier ryzhkov sat down with miners monday and worked out a 
concrete program of actions for the entire countrys coal 
industry pravda said the communist party newspaper did not give 
details of the plan 
bolderev said in a telephone interview the miners still on 
strike were staying out for purely psychological reasons 
arising from an explosion of despair 
people dont want to tolerate local officials any longer he 
said 
in a reference to that the supreme soviet statement said local 
elections scheduled for spring should be moved up to foster a 
cleansing of the government apparatus of unqualified and 
incapable workers reduction of the bureaucracy and liquidation 
of undeserved privileges 
gorbachev has said the communist party and government bodies 
need reorganization to remove people blocking reform 
state tv said ryzhkov met tuesday with miners from the pechora 
basin in the arctic and the dnepropetrovsk region of the ukraine 
and expressed sympathy for their demands for better housing 
working conditions food and transport 
it said he would issue a special decree next week aimed at 
meeting their demands 
viktor g kucherenko head of the supreme soviets planning and 
budget commission has estimated strike settlements will cost up to 
86 billion the government already has a budget deficit of 156 
billion 
the voroshilovgrad strikers were among the last holdouts of the 
nationwide coal strike which began july 11 in western siberia and 
spread to coal fields across the country siberian miners returned 
to work last week after the government agreed to nearly all their 
demands 
in vorkuta in the arctic the strike committee called for an end 
to the walkout monday after listening with great attention to 
gorbachevs appeals tass reported 
valery serdyuk communist party chief in vorkuta said by 
telephone regular work had not resumed at any of the 13 mines and 
most miners were awaiting formal approval of their 42 demands by 
the soviet council of ministers

coal but the critical situation in the coaldependent metal 
industry had passed

in 1971 michael dorris became one of the first 
bachelors allowed to adopt a child he also became an unwitting 
partner in the childs struggle against fetal alcohol syndrome 
if you grow up with the idea that the world is fair you cant 
accept that these kids never had a chance dorris a dartmouth 
professor said in an interview about his recently published book 
on his sons illness 
after years of research dorris came to grips with the fact that 
his sons illness was preventable but incurable he wrote the 
broken cord to tell the world about and perhaps help someone 
avoid a disease passed along by harddrinking mothers but it gave 
him no surcease from his pain 
its not been cathartic one of the problems with this book is 
that it does not have an ending said dorris 
i finished the book when my son was 21 the age of majority 
when your child is expected to be independent dorris said during 
a recent stay in boston but it keeps going on its like 
constantly opening doors into a dark room 
adam the pseudonym hes given his son in the book now 
works four days a week as a dishwasher at a truck stop in new 
hampshire he lives in a group home and has to be reminded to 
bathe change his clothes even eat 
fetal alcohol syndrome the nations thirdlargest cause of 
retardation was undocumented and unnamed a little more than a 
decade ago 
nearly 8000 children a year or 1 to 3 of every 1000 born 
have some or all of the syndromes symptoms these children many 
born to parents who also have fas suffer seizures have poor 
eyesight balance or hearing they frequently have curvature of the 
spine and too many teeth 
their intelligence often is severely impaired they cant grasp 
retain memories or reason into the future 
adam was born on a sioux reservation to a woman who eventually 
died of alcohol poisoning 
studies since have revealed that 5 percent to 25 percent of the 
children born on some reservations have fas and there are 
estimates that up to 50 percent of the members of some american 
indian tribes will have been born with it by the year 2000 
dorris whose adoption application was aided by his partial 
indian ancestry spent two years teaching adam to tie his 
shoelaces adam the eldest of three adopted children was 5 before 
he was toilettrained 
ive lost my temper a million times and then felt guilty 
said dorris adjunct professor of anthropology at dartmouth and a 
cofounder of the schools native american studies program but a 
very direct anger is at least clear to him its unambiguous 
he said the books original impetus was scientific he wanted to 
document fas and make the public aware 
society has to take note that this is a terribly dangerous 
problem he said noting that the federal government is not 
currently funding any fasrelated programs we have to have 
education detox centers and health care for these women 
dorris offers education as an alternative to more drastic 
measures that some activists have suggested such as sterilization 
or imprisonment for pregnant women who have previously given birth 
to fas children 
dorris said he and his wife the writer louise erdrich who in 
addition to their three adopted american indian children have three 
biological daughters long ago gave up trying to reason with their 
son 
logic is out of adams reach dorris confesses that despite his 
training as an anthropologist he still hopes against rational hope 
that his son one day will suddenly see everything clearly 
but it makes no sense it cant happen he said

relics of st justin the martyr have been 
laid to rest after 1600 years in which they have been entombed in 
the catacombs secreted away by italian nobles and displayed in a 
maryland church 
an urn containing 15 small brittle bones believed to be st 
justins was buried monday in a shady plot near st marys roman 
catholic church 
weve finally put st justin to rest said the rev john 
murray who found the bones in a church safe 20 months ago and 
conducted the funeral its not every day that you get to witness 
burial of a 1600yearold martyr 
after he found the relics murray pieced together their history 
beginning in rome in the 4th century ad when justin was beheaded 
at age 26 
justin was elevated to sainthood soon after his death and his 
remains were buried in the catacombs the caverns beneath the 
appian way in rome used by early christians 
then in 1757 archaeologists unearthed remains they identified 
as st justins along with what they believed were the remains of 
two other martyrs st sergius and st nazarius murray said 
for the next 110 years the three sets of relics were cared for 
by a series of noble italian families and bishops but in 1873 
during a period of civil unrest in italy the church sent them to 
the rev joseph wissel in baltimore for safekeeping 
wissell kept the box containing the relics of st justin which 
he displayed prominently in the church and sent the others 
elsewhere during renovations to st marys in the 1960s priests 
put the relics wrapped in yellowed paper in a box in the church 
safe 
murray isnt at all sure the relics will remain in their present 
resting place even though the burial was cleared by the local 
church hierarchy 
the vatican may want me to send the relics back to rome 
murray said if they want me to do that then well dig him up

two former ptl aides were convicted 
tuesday of evading 525000 in income taxes on money they took from 
the television ministry to buy condominiums furs jewelry and 
nearly 100000 worth of shoes 
a federal jury deliberated five hours before convicting the 
brothers james and david taggart on identical charges conspiracy 
to defraud the government and impede the irs by willfully evading 
income taxes and filing false tax returns for the years 1984 
1985 1986 and 1987 
greed doesnt pay no matter how rich you are youve got to 
pay your taxes said federal prosecutor david brown after the 
verdict the statement was not about ptl it was about david 
taggart and james taggarts obligations to pay their taxes no 
matter how much they own and what kind of lifestyle they live 
brown said he wasnt surprised the jury took just five hours 
they didnt need to spend a lot of time looking at the 
documents he said a person can omit 200 in income on their 
tax return but its hard to miss 1 million 
they were innocent going in and they are innocent coming 
out said defense lawyer ben cotten he said he was to blame for 
the guilty verdict citing my ineptitude and two very capable and 
competent government counsel backed with unlimited resources 
brown said the case was decided by the defendants own 
testimony but cotten said they were forced to testify 
they had to take the stand cotten said they had to tell 
their story if they hadnt the jury wouldnt have been able to 
believe anything but a series of paper trails 
cotten said the taggarts reaction to the verdict was a calm 
where do we go from here the brothers refused comment as they 
left the courthouse 
the taggarts were charged with evasion after they allegedly 
spent nearly 12 million in ptl money on personal luxuries such as 
condominiums including a 640000 apartment at trump tower in new 
york jewlery and designer clothes cotten said the money was 
approved by the ministrys founder jim bakker 
in earlier testimony a representative from a new york city fur 
shop said the taggarts spent about 35000 on mink coats and other 
furs for themselves at her store and a salesman for a new york 
shoe store said the taggarts spent nearly 100000 from 198286 on 
shoes for themselves 
other testimony included the pair spent 320000 in four 
purchases at cartiers jewelry store in new york including 96000 
on one ring they also took european vacations with friends and 
family often crossing the atlantic on a concord jet 
cotten said his clients werent bitter at their former boss for 
refusing to testify bakker invoked his right against 
selfincrimination when he was called to the stand 
bakker and former ptl executive vice president richard dortch go 
on trial aug 28 on charges of wire and mail fraud 
both bakker and his wife tammy faye bakker would often plead 
for funds on television bakker and dortch were indicted last dec 
5 on charges of conspiring to defraud their supporters by diverting 
more than 4 million to support their lavish lifestyles if 
convicted each faces more than 120 years in prison and more than 
5 million in fines 
bakker quit ptl in march 1987 in a sex and money scandal after 
he confessed to a sexual affair with former church secretary 
jessica hahn 
the taggarts joined ptl in the late 1970s as piano players 
within a few years david taggart 32 was bakkers top personal 
aide his brother james 35 was the interior designer at ptls 
heritage usa christian retreat just south of charlotte 
brown said he would recommend a stiff sentence each brother 
faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and more than 1 million in 
fines sentencing was set for aug 25

white house officials had little to say 
tuesday about felix bloch the state department diplomat being 
investigated as a possible spy but spokesman marlin fitzwater 
clearly had bloch on his mind 
fielding a question about another matter fitzwater said 
president bush has repeatedly expressed his outrage about 
influencepeddling at the department of housing and urban 
development and talked to secretary bloch on a number of 
occasions about remedying the situation 
secretary kemp im sorry fitzwater quickly added this 
time getting the name of hud secretary jack kemp right 
later asked about reports that the united states had warned the 
soviets not to spirit bloch out of the country fitzwater said he 
did not know of them 
but noting reports that bloch was trailed from a relatives home 
by both the fbi and soviet officials fitzwater quipped as near 
as i can tell the entire fbi and the soviet embassy is living with 
the guy i dont think hes going anywhere unnoticed

soviet defense minister dmitri yazov arrived 
tuesday on an historic visit to britain and said he doesnt believe 
an eastwest treaty on conventional forces can be forged as quickly 
as president bush hopes 
yazov the first soviet defense minister to visit a nato country 
since world war ii also said british and french troops based in 
west germany should be included with american troops in a 
conventional arms agreement 
the general spoke at a news conference with defense secretary 
george younger after talks with prime minister margaret thatcher 
and younger later he met new foreign secretary john major 
yazov was pessimistic when asked if a conventional arms treaty 
could be agreed as quickly as bush urged at the may summit of north 
atlantic treaty organization 
bush challenged moscow to reach a treaty by next year and carry 
it out by 1993 the timetable also has been linked by the west to 
talks with the warsaw pact on shortrange nuclear forces and 
nuclear reductions 
myself i do not believe that such a deal could be concluded 
that quickly yazov said 
not all problems are being solved smoothly he said 
although figures decided by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and bush are very close 
in particular he said troops from european nations of the 
western alliance should not be excluded from a us proposal to 
restrict each side to 275000 troops in east or west germany 
britain france and other nations keep 170000 troops in west 
germany he said 
everything should be taken into account yazov said through 
an interpreter if these matters are solved then we dont 
believe the process of negotiations will take a long time 
he said he and mrs thatcher both took note that the cold war 
times are behind us 
a senior british official said talks with yazov will focus on 
moscows new defensive military strategy and soviet views of bushs 
disarmament proposals 
on charges that the new soviet military doctrine is defensive 
while soviet forces grouping remains offensive yazov told 
reporters it is impossible to declare we are defensive today 
and immediately change the organization 
the soviets have pledged to withdraw 10000 tanks 8500 
artillery weapons and 820 aircraft from east european countries 
british officials say the withdrawals are on schedule but they 
suspect ammunition may be left behind to improve the capability of 
remaining weapons 
on wednesday yazov will visit a royal air force base in 
scotland to inspect phantom and tornado fighters which sweep natos 
northern air flank for soviet intrusions and an aircraft carrier 
hms invincible 
his fourday visit is part of increased eastwest military 
contacts under gorbachevs policy of reduced confrontation 
this is the beginning of an official high level 
sovietbritish defense relationship a senior british official 
said on condition of anonymity

president bush still opposes any new taxes 
even to pay for drugfighting programs and is cool to the new idea 
of selling bonds to finance the war on drugs his spokesman 
indicated tuesday 
a day after bushs top drug policy adviser william bennett 
said that maybe down the road we will use higher taxes to 
fight the drug battle white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
emphasized that the president remains opposed to raising taxes 
for any purpose 
bennett had said that there are other choices besides taxes 
but also said crack is worse than taxes 
there were mixed signals tuesday from the white house and 
bennett on the advisability of selling savings bonds to pay for 
increased antidrug activity 
fitzwater said such a notion was fraught with practical 
problems 
but bennett said he liked the idea and has raised it with 
richard darman director of the office of management and budget 
legislation to sell drug bonds has been introduced in congress war 
bonds were sold to help finance the second world war 
such suggestions envision a financing mechanism that has a lot 
of aspects to it that havent been thought out about how would 
the money be paid back how would it be collected the interest 
rates fitzwater told reporters at the white house on tuesday 
but generally speaking any kind of bond system is a part of the 
general financing of the government youre still talking about 
government borrowing 
fitzwater downplaying reports that the administration was 
looking closely at the idea noted that bennett is looking at a lot 
of suggestions including drug bonds as he considers what 
recommendations he will make for a drugfighting strategy bennett 
director of the office of national drug control policy is to 
report to bush on sept 5 
bennett noted tuesday that the idea for drugwar bonds did not 
originate with him but was pushed by some on capitol hill 
however he told reporters at a luncheon it does answer one 
question for me which is i get tons of mail from people asking 
what they can do this would be a very good thing to be able to 
say buy war bonds 
bennett said his office gets money in the mail we get dollar 
bills five dollar bills checks people say please use this for 
the war on drugs 
bennett said that he wasnt calling for a tax increase to pay 
for the drug war its not my job to figure out how to pay for 
it he said 
my job is to set the strategy how to wage this war on 
drugs effectively he said its darmans job and others to 
figure out how to pay for it 
how to pay for a greatly expanded antidrug program is becoming 
a topic for heightened debate as congress wrangles over tradeoffs 
in defense and other areas to bring the budget into line 
everyone anticipates there will be more money needed and more 
money spent on fighting the drug epidemic fitzwater said the 
sources of that money is a different question 
bennett has refused to say how much he expects the federal 
government to invest in the antidrug effort 
two california republicans sen pete wilson and rep jerry 
lewis introduced legislation last week to sell 4 billion worth of 
savings bonds to raise money to fight the drug war sen bob 
graham dfla said monday he was offering a similar bill

a private commission recommended tuesday that 
medicare finance adult day care and help at home for frail elderly 
people who are struggling to stay out of nursing homes and maintain 
their independence 
the commission on elderly people living alone made up of 
experts on health policy and aging recommended that the new 
benefit be provided to 16 million older americans who live at home 
and suffer from severe physical or mental limitations 
these people most of them women currently rely mainly on 
family and friends for help with routine tasks of daily life such 
as eating bathing and getting out of bed the panel said 
providing a modest personal care benefit to this vulnerable 
population could improve the availability of community care ease 
the burden of family caregiving and help to delay or avoid the 
placement of these individuals in nursing homes it said 
the commission established in 1985 by the commonwealth fund 
philanthropic foundation recommended that medicare cover up to 25 
hours of inhome care per week and allow two hours of adult day 
care to be substituted for each hour of home assistance the cost 
this year would be 68 billion 
the commissions report help at home said many informal 
caregivers are themselves elderly of modest means and in poor 
health and need outside assistance to supplement what care they 
provide 
the study said 80 percent of informal caregivers had been 
providing assistance seven days a week for at least a year 9 
percent had to quit jobs because of the competing time demands 21 
percent had reduced the number of hours they work and 19 had taken 
time off without pay 
this is a story of poor women taking care of poor women said 
karen davis director of the commission and chairman of the 
department of health policy and management at the johns hopkins 
university school of hygiene and public health the emotional and 
financial toll on these caregivers can be enormous 
the study said about onethird of the frail elderly have to rely 
on purchased care to supplement informal help from family and 
friends those with the most severe impairments will spend an 
average 7800 for home care this year it estimated 
the outofpocket spending for care can be a crushing burden 
for the severely impaired and their families said dr robert 
butler chairman of the commission and of the department of 
geriatrics and adult development at new yorks mount sinai medical 
center it is now time to begin to alleviate these heavy 
burdens 
more than 5 million of the 29 million elderly americans who live 
at home suffer from physical disabilities or cognitive problems 
such as loss of memory or alzheimers disease the commission said 
the proposed homecare benefits would cover only the 16 million 
with the greatest physical and mental limitations 300000 of whom 
live alone and are in particular need of home care 
medicare would pay 80 percent of the costs for limited amounts 
of home care with medicaid helping to pay the balance for poor 
older americans the proposal would cost 68 billion if it were in 
place for 1989 and the cost would rise to 93 billion by the year 
2000 as the nations elderly population continues to grow

the european community on tuesday 
strengthened its ties to eastern europe by reaching an agreement on 
trade and economic cooperation with poland 
the accord is the third between the 12nation western european 
trading bloc and an east european country since a thaw in relations 
in little more than a year 
a spokesman for the european community said group officials 
would meet with polish representatives to sign the new pact as soon 
as possible 
the fiveyear accord sets a timetable for gradually lifting 
quotas and tariffs on a range of industrial and farm products 
it also calls for greater cooperation in such fields as 
petrochemicals construction mining energy transportation 
tourism and telecommunications 
the trade negotiations began last march 
the community imported about 32 billion in goods from poland 
in 1987 and sent exports of about 26 billion dollars 
the european community also known as the common market already 
has a trade and cooperation accord with hungary and a trade 
agreement on manufactured goods with czechoslovakia negotiations 
are under way for similar arrangements with the soviet union and 
bulgaria 
the common market has pushed hard to negotiate trade deals with 
east bloc nations since it signed a declaration in june 1988 
establishing official relations with the sovietled economic bloc 
the council for mutual economic assistance the landmark 
declaration ended three decades of economic estrangement between 
western and eastern europe 
also on tuesday a european community spokesman said its 
officials will visit poland and hungary this week to prepare for a 
conference on economic aid for the two countries 
the teams will take stock of the situation in each country in 
advance of the aug 1 meeting in brussels of officials from 23 
countries said the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the leaders of the seven richest democracies meeting at a

robert s lyons wooed ladies with tales 
of his exploits as the nations youngest major general his work 
for the cia and national security council his rescue of hundreds 
of pows from vietnam 
he showed acquaintances copies of a publication called the 
pentagon gazette with a cover picture of him in an army shirt with 
generals stars on the epaulets the newsletter claimed to be a 
specialedition tribute to one of washingtons wellknown 
bestkept secrets 
but on monday the 35yearold water purification unit salesman 
pleaded guilty in federal court to falsely impersonating a federal 
officer 
his guilty plea was in connection with a story he had told a 
girlfriend that he was an army general working for the cia and 
the nsc and that he needed 1000 to get out of the cia according 
to assistant us attorney leon patton 
he told the woman he was trying to disassociate himself from 
the cia that he needed 1000 to cover bad checks he had written 
and that they were holding that over his head to keep him in the 
cia patton said 
the woman gave him a check on jan 31 and lyons has since 
repaid the money he said 
lyons contacted by telephone tuesday did not want to discuss 
the case 
i really dont have nothing to say he said before hanging 
up 
patton said tuesday the whole thing came undone when lyons told 
his girlfriend he had been convicted in the irancontra arms deal 
had lost his military retirement and that because of the 
possibility of terrorist attack he was under protection of the 
secret service 
the government found out about lyons when the woman contacted 
the secret service to check the story patton said 
lyons did serve in the army patton said and was given an 
honorable discharge as a private 
officers at fort leavenworth kan have seen the bogus copy of 
the pentagon gazette and they were not impressed 
thats the first thing that got me was what this guy was 
wearing on the front of the pentagon gazette an opencollar shirt 
with a gold chain around his neck lt col john garlinger said 
tuesday no military officer i dont care if hes a second 
lieutenant or a general will wear an opencollar shirt with a gold 
chain around his neck 
garlinger got a copy of the bogus newsletter from the owner of a 
uniform store in leavenworth the town on the edge of fort 
leavenworth lyons had plunked down a copy of the newsletter at the 
store as a way of identifying himself as a general to buy a 
generals uniform he said 
the fivepage edition of the pentagon gazette carried around by 
lyons dated august 1988 said he successfully brought back 285 
live pows and the remains of over 300 missing pows and mias from 
vietnam in 1983 an event supposedly overshadowed by the dedication 
of the vietnam veterans wall and memorial in washington dc 
bob sturm the police chief in mission kan the kansas city 
suburb where lyons lives said lyons also wore a generals uniform 
into a print shop in town to get the article printed 
you can lie and be creative about it and sometimes get by 
said garlinger but this kind of stuff in the pentagon gazette is 
so outrageous 
obviously however he did convince some folks that he was 
telling the truth he said 
sentencing for lyons is set for sept 25 he faces a maximum of 
three years in prison and fines of 250000

the june 4 fire caused by a gas leak in the ural 
mountains has killed 645 people including 181 children a soviet 
official told the legislature tuesday 
previous soviet reports cited more than 600 deaths but did not 
give a precise figure 
two trains carrying 1284 passengers and crew members were 
engulfed in the inferno caused by a spark from an electrical line 
it ignited a highly flammable mixture of benzine and propanebutane 
gas leaking from a pipeline near the city of ufa about 750 miles 
southeast of moscow 
the incident is being investigated as a criminal case by the 
soviet prosecutors office with results expected in november 
investigators are focusing on how the pipeline was built and run 
said vitaly doguzhiyev a deputy prime minister heading that state 
commission on emergencies 
the investigation has so far revealed that the pipeline was in 
poor condition in need of repair at several places and lacking 
insulation elsewhere tass quoted doguzhiyev as telling parliament 
thirty of the victims have yet to be identified tass quoted him 
as saying of those killed 213 died in hospitals 46 of them 
children it said another 396 people were treated at hospitals and 
released 
the line has been idle since the accident once the case is 
closed doguzhiyev told parliament the line will be used to carry 
oil rather than gas

a senior house republican called tuesday for a 
us counterintelligence buildup and expanded surveillance of 
soviet agents as the fbi tailed by soviet agents pressed its 
spy investigation of career diplomat felix s bloch 
newt gingrich the gop whip in the house said after a white 
house meeting with president bush that the fbis 
counterintelligence capabilities had been weakened over the past 15 
years along with us ability to know exactly what the kgb is 
doing 
the georgian added i think that as people look at that case 
there is going to be a very serious effort to rethink how much 
how much resources do we need to put into counterintelligence 
activities and to what degree do we have to strengthen that 
capability its obviously a very serious concern 
the soviets meanwhile were showing extraordinary interest in 
the investigation of the 54yearold diplomat even tailing him and 
the fbi to new york 
the unusual soviet surveillance shows they have a lot invested 
in this said a government source familiar with the case 
the united states cautioned the soviet union against trying to 
smuggle bloch out of the country it was learned monday evening 
the warning came weeks before news organizations reported that the 
30year career diplomat was suspected of spying 
even so bloch and a caravan of fbi agents were followed by 
soviet embassy personnel on saturday from washington to a new york 
city suburb the government source said 
still the former no 2 official in the us embassy in vienna 
was not arrested several officials suggested the government was 
trying to bolster its case against bloch and even hoped the 
soviets would try to establish contact with him 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said the 
department has had no contact with the soviets regarding the 
bloch investigation but she declined to say whether moscow had 
been cautioned against trying to smuggle bloch out of the country 
the embattled diplomat was suspended from his job as director of 
the office of regional politicaleconomic affairs on june 22 and 
surrendered his diplomatic passport but no restrictions were 
imposed on his travels by the state department 
the bloch investigation centers on the eight years he served in 
vienna first as an economic officer and then from 1981 to 1987 
as deputy chief of mission 
senior us officials said bloch would have had access in the 
deputy ambassadors post to all messages that passed between 
washington and the vienna embassy 
the central intelligence agency would have a responsibility to 
keep him informed said an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity and he would know about arms transfers 
in addition officials have said bloch participated in a 
decision announced by the commerce department last week to allow 
the sale of a broad range of personal computers to the soviet union 
and easternbloc countries 
austria as a neutral country is not bound by the restrictions 
the united states other western countries and japan impose on 
technology sales 
to try to prevent securitysensitive sales the us embassy in 
vienna acting on instructions from washington tries to dissuade 
the austrians from permitting questionable deals to go through 
officials said 
the officials stressed that bloch probably had a larger role to 
play in embassy issues because he served under two political 
rather than career ambassadors helene von damm and ronald lauder 
gingrichs suggestion that us counterintelligence needed to be 
built up and a suggestion he might use the defense bill now 
before congress to accomplish that end got a mixed reception at 
the white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush also was concerned 
about the governments capabilities but the spokesman said we 
dont advocate any specific changes at this point

orange bill 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
vietnam veterans suffering from cancers and 
other ailments presumably linked to exposure to agent orange would 
receive government compensation under a bill introduced tuesday in 
the house 
the measure represents the latest round of a struggle between 
veterans advocates who say the government is ignoring evidence 
about the deadly herbicide and government scientists who say no 
clear cause and effect can be established 
this legislation takes the important breakthrough step in 
creating a presumption that certain conditions if developed in an 
individual after exposure are presumed related to that exposure 
and are our countrys responsibility not a burden of that 
conflict to be borne in tragic isolation by the veteran said 
rep david e skaggs dcolo a marine veteran of vietnam and one 
of 60 cosponsors of the bill 
the bill introduced by reps lane evans dill and martin 
lancaster dnc allows veterans to be compensated longer and for 
more diseases than a version that has cleared the senate veterans 
affairs committee 
under the house bill costing about 40 million a year veterans 
with nonhodgkins lymphoma softtissue sarcoma melanoma and 
basal cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability 
benefits so would their survivors 
the bill would also establish a presumption of service 
connection for any vietnam veteran with chloracne a skin 
condition provided it occurred within a year of service 
the senate bill covering only soft tissue sarcoma and 
nonhodgkins lymphoma would provide benefits until april 15 1992 
the house and senate bills would both require extensive 
recordkeeping based on health reports and tissue samples from 
veterans both would ask the national academy of sciences to review 
scientific studies on agent orange exposure every two years with 
the department of veterans affairs making its benefits 
determinations based on those reviews 
veterans are already allowed to receive outpatient and hospital 
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to agent orange 
the senate passed an agent orange bill last year but the measure 
never emerged from the house veterans affairs committee 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the house 
committee and the senior minority member rep bob stump rariz 
sent their colleagues a threepage letter tuesday calling the newly 
introduced bill premature at best 
they cited an ongoing study by the centers for disease control 
on the incidence of selected cancers among vietnamera veterans 
due for completion next spring they also cited a federal court 
order to change the criteria used to evaluate agent orange studies 
and the recent creation of a us court of veterans appeals to 
review claims 
but supporters of the bill say the cdc and va have dragged their 
feet in trying to determine whether a link exists between agent 
orange exposure and the various afflictions 
cdc was accused in a house government operations subcommittee 
hearing two weeks ago of botching or rigging its agent orange study 
to fail cdc contends it dropped a massive study of agent orange 
exposure because there was no way to tell who was exposed 
about 12 million gallons of the herbicide wre sprayed during the 
war to remove the lush foliage that provided ground cover to the 
enemy agent orange contains dioxin one of the most toxic 
chemicals known as well as 245t and 24d also harmful 
chemicals 
an estimated 26 million military personnel served within the 
borders of south vietnam about 250000 have told va they believe 
they were exposed and 35000 have applied for disability benefits

after 75 years as a daily newspaper the 
clearwater sun will become a weekly next month its publisher 
announced 
the change at the sun results from competition in the tampa bay 
area from the st petersburg times and the tampa tribune publisher 
bruce e coury said monday 
we faced a choice of continuing to operate a small daily 
newspaper in a market that is already served by two giant 
metropolitan newspapers or creating a truly outstanding and 
distinctive weekly that could target its resources toward the 
specific unfulfilled needs of clearwater readers and advertisers 
coury said in a statement 
some staff cuts would be made as a result of the change 
effective aug 4 but the extent of those cuts was not yet 
determined coury said the newspaper has a daily circulation of 
just under 15000 
the emphasis of the weekly clearwater sun will be local 
issues events people neighborhoods and sports the sun will be 
the newspaper for and about clearwater coury said 
clearwater newspapers inc will continue to publish the free 
sunrise with a circulation of more than 100000 in north pinellas 
county coury said the company also will continue to publish 
thunderbolt the official weekly newspaper of macdill air force

gov bob martinez on tuesday called a 
special legislative session for october to consider new 
restrictions on abortions 
were dealing with lives the unborn martinez said i 
believe that by a better balance of rights we can provide for more 
life here in the state of florida 
in a letter to state house and senate leaders the governor 
called for legislation to block the use of tax money public 
facilities and public employees for abortions and for tougher 
licensing standards for abortion clinics 
he also urged that the period of pregnancy in which the state 
doesnt restrict abortion be shortened to five months from six 
months 
the cal for a special session to begin oct 10 was a reaction to 
a us supreme court decision three weeks ago that allows states 
greater leeway in regulating abortion 
martinez would not stop rape or incest victims from getting 
abortions or women whose lives are threatened by a pregnancy 
women who are in their first 20 weeks of pregnancy would also have 
the option of abortion but not at public expense 
martinez didnt propose specific bills rather he offered what 
he called guidelines for laws to be drafted by legislators 
i dont believe we ought to have state dollars to engage in 
abortion except for the exceptions ive indicated the governor 
said 
martinez also asked lawmakers to ensure a pregnant woman has the 
medical information to make an informed choice about abortion 
connie amidei an official with the tallahassee chapter of the 
national organization for women tried on at least three occasions 
to shout over reporters questions to challenge the governor on his 
position 
the governor is not accessible hes not talking to us said 
ms amidei who accused martinez of seeking political gain on the 
issue 
first of all let me say from the beginning ive said the 
polls are not an issue here martinez said 
the american civil liberties union also condemned martinezs 
call for a special session and the proposal he submitted for 
consideration spokeswoman robin blumner said in miami 
florida law allows abortions during the first six months of 
pregnancy a woman must have permission from two doctors based on 
health reasons to acquire an abortion in the last trimester of 
pregnancy 
lawmakers are also awaiting a decision from the florida supreme 
court on the states new parentalconsent law which the 
legislature passed in 1988 that law prohibits minors from getting 
an abortion without approval from a parent guardian or judge

dozens of people protested at the annual 
stockholder meeting of one of the worlds largest furriers tuesday 
saying the animal rights movement is making furs look 
unfashionable and stupid 
the protesters gathered at the annual meeting of evans inc 
waving signs with pictures of wounded animals and slogans such as 
buy a fur and slip into something dead 
evans company policy is not to comment on such protests but 
randall barberis vice president of marketing said the animal 
rights movement has had no effect on business 
evans reported a loss of 38 million in fiscal 1989 on sales of 
148 million and the industry has seen two straight off years 
an analyst attributed the performance to mild winters that 
lowered demand and lower pelt prices which reduced the cost of 
furs to consumers 
evans earlier this month reported a firstquarter loss for 
fiscal 1990 of 228 million on sales of 165 million compared 
with a loss of 232 million on sales of 147 million in the same 
quarter a year ago 
i think the fur industry is drying up said a woman who 
called herself mink stole and said she was an actress and member of 
the washingtonbased people for the ethical treatment of animals 
we are making fur look unfashionable and stupid the woman 
said fur caters to vanity so if we hurt vanity people wont buy 
it 
but an analyst disputed the effects of the animal rights 
movement on the industrys performance 
it is impossible to quantify any effect that any antifur 
movement has had said linda baker an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities in new york 
the antifur movement has become fairly visible but also the 
retailers have recognized that and the fur industry which is 
traditionally very fragmented has organized to neutralize the 
antifur movement with education 
this year actually should be a good year for consumers who want 
to buy a fur because pelt prices have declined slightly again 
meaning the price of a finished fur product should be lower ms 
baker said 
evans also sees a better year ahead barberis said 
i think it is fair to say that because of those reasons the 
last couple of years have been tough in selling furs but we think 
that there is every reason to be optimistic in coming years in 
terms of selling furs to consumers he said

lawmakers trip to north korea 
at other rallies tuesday radical students demanded the

illegal trip to north korea lawmakers and members of the leading 
party for peace and democracy sat crosslegged on straw mats in 
seoul angrily jabbing clenched fists in the air and shouting 
apologize regime of president roh taewoo and stop 
suppressing the ppd 
the party says a national security agency investigation into one 
of its lawmakers illegal trip to north korea has been enlarged to 
destroy the party protesters said they will continue the sitin 
until rohs government apologizes publicly 
they said the latest fabrication is a story published 
tuesday by the official news agency yonhap suggesting party leader 
kim daejung wrote a letter to north korean leader kim il sung 
party leaders do not deny their national assemblyman suh 
kyungwon made an illegal trip to pyongyang but they say they had 
no prior knowledge of the trip and charge investigators are using 
black propaganda to destroy the party 
they visited prime minister kang younghoon tuesday to press for 
an apology

visits to the communist north by a student a clergyman and the 
lawmaker has increased police surveillance of colleges and 
universities and offered rewards for radical student leaders

radical student im sukyong who plans to reenter south korea on 
thursday the anniversary of the ceasefire which ended the 195053 
korean war by crossing at panmunjom truce village in the 
demilitarized zone 
for radicals and dissidents the border crossing symbolizes 
their demands for unifying the peninsula divided since the end of 
world war ii 
the united nations command in charge of security at panmunjom

president bush remains adamant in support 
of a constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the flag 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
he said the justice department has concluded that federal courts 
would rule unconstitutional any statutory attempt to circumvent the 
recent supreme court decision overturning flag desecration laws 
the only way to protect the flag is through a constitutional 
amendment said fitzwater he said congress should pass the 
bushbacked amendment if it is serious about protecting the 
flag 
the president is adamant in his support of the public demand 
to protect the flag flagburning is an affront to americas 
patriotic values it the flag should be constitutionally 
protected he said 
bush has endorsed an amendment saying that the congress and 
the states shall have the power to prohibit the physical 
desecration of the flag of the united states 
some lawmakers and legal scholars including house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash have raised concerns about what 
constitutes desecration and whether the amendment would weaken the 
bill of rights some lawmakers also say enthusiasm for an amendment 
is waning among their constituents 
however fitzwater said he thinks public sentiment is running 
strongly in favor of the effort to amend the constitution 
one reporter asked fitzwater why the flag needed special 
protection when crosses have been burned longer in this country 
than flags and despite those burnings the christian faith and 
church have survived 
regardless of that we still believe flagburning should not 
be legal fitzwater replied

la cellesaintcloud france ap cambodian peace talks broke 
down tuesday five days before an international conference with an 
impasse reported between prime minister hun sen and the three 
factions opposing him 
hun sen refused to combine his vietnamesebacked government 
delegation with resistance representatives at the conference that 
begins sunday and he refused to agree to participation by the 
notorious khmer rouge guerrillas in an interim government 
there is no use in meeting again said prince norodom 
sihanouk head of the resistance coalition the disagreement is 
total 
hun sen blamed the khmer rouge the strongest of the guerrilla 
factions for the breakdown in the talks 
we can now ask whether the international conference will open 
or not hun sen said adding that the parties were working with 
french foreign minister roland dumas to find a solution 
there are still a few days before the conference and we will 
try to find a compromise formula he said 
the talks at an 18th centry chateau in suburban paris foundered 
mainly on involvement by the chinesebacked khmer rouge first at 
the negotiating table and then in a proposed interim government 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and installed a new 
government to end a threeyear reign of terror by the khmer rouge 
in which hundreds of thousands were killed hanoi has promised to 
finish pulling out its estimated 70000 troops by the end of 
september 
the cambodian peace conference is to open sunday while no more 
toplevel meetings were scheduled before then hun sen said he 
hoped contacts between the groups would continue 
the cambodian prime minister said all issues of agreement 
reached during two informal meetings in jakarta indonesia were 
completely abandoned tuesday he said the groups were back to 
the situation existing a decade ago at the start of the war 
its like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot 
continue its journey he told a news conference 
hun sen wants two parties representing cambodia his government 
and sihanouks coalition 
to acknowledge that there are two cambodias is mortal for our 
country sihanouk said we dont want partition 
sihanouk proposed the four parties attend as a single 
delegation a move hun sen called unacceptable 
under sihanouks proposal the khmer rouge would be involved 
but not as a separate entity 
hun sen rejects khmer rouge participation in an interim 
government while sihanouk argues that excluding the most powerful 
guerrilla force risks renewed civil war in cambodia 
other points of disagreement were a proposed ceasefire which 
sihanouk refuses and the composition of an international 
peacekeeping force to monitor the vietnamese pullout 
hun sen said the final withdrawal will take place sept 2126 by 
land river and sea 
the breakdown tuesday came after about four hours of talks 
between hun sen sihanouk son sann head of the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front and khieu samphan 
nominal chief of the khmer rouge 
now the problem to resolve is finding a formula to meet at the 
international conference said a french foreign ministry 
spokesman speaking on condition he not be identified by name we 
can always find a formula maybe not before sunday 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
its important for the parties to narrow their differences he 
said us officials will try to help advance that process 
hun sen stressed his position that the paris conference must not 
be abandoned for our part well try to do everything so that 
the conference can take place he said 
among the participants lined up for the international 
conference expected to last about a month are the united states 
soviet union china france britain japan canada vietnam and 
the six members of the association of southeast asian nations 
most are to be represented at the opening by their foreign 
ministers with secretary of state james a baker iii attending for 
the united states

president daniel ortega said tuesday 
he believes the issue of demobilizing usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
can be solved at next weeks summit meeting of central american 
presidents 
ortega also said he will meet with the nicaraguas political 
opposition shortly before the aug 57 summit in tela honduras 
i have confidence that we can give a definitive answer to this 
problem of the contras nicaraguan rebels during this meeting in 
august ortega said during a news conference at the foreign 
correspondents club in managua 
he said dissolving the force of about 11000 rebels based in 
camps in honduras would ease the approach to other problems in 
the region 
while the contras are in honduras the war among nicaraguans 
continues developing ortega said 
at a central american summit conference feb 14 in el salvador 
ortega promised to move up general elections in nicaragua to next 
feb 25 and to adopt rules to ensure the balloting will be fair 
for their part the presidents of el salvador honduras 
guatemala and costa rica promised to come up with a plan by may 15 
to demobilize the contras in honduras and a summit was scheduled 
for that date 
but the conference was postponed several times before it was set 
for august 
the us congress in midapril approved 49 million in 
nonlethal aid to the contras to run until after the nicaraguan 
elections in february 
ortega responding to a reporters question said a decision by 
the central american presidents to postpone the demobilization of 
the contras until february would be yielding to us pressure and 
it would mean accepting the continuation of the war in nicaragua 
contra and sandinista leaders signed a temporary ceasefire in 
march 1988 a month after the us congress decided to discontinue 
military aid to the rebels 
only sporadic skirmishes have been reported since then 
ortega said his sandinista government has fulfilled all the 
promises it made at the el salvador summit 
he said it moved up the date for elections released 1897 
former national guard members encouraged the contras to lay down 
their weapons and join the political process allowed the formation 
of political parties with minimum requirements and established a 
balanced supreme electoral council to oversee elections the 
imprisoned national guardsmen had served in the regime of president 
anastasio somoza which lost a civil war to the sandinistas in july 
1979 
im taking this list of accomplishments to the meeting in 
honduras ortega said whats going to be tested is the will of 
the governments of central america and in particular the government 
of honduras 
i have hopes that what will prevail is the will of the 
governments of central america above the will of the government 
of the united states 
ortega said earlier this month he would meet with the leaders of 
nicaraguas opposition political groups to discuss the electoral 
laws adopted by the sandinistadominated national assembly 
he said tuesday that the meeting would be held next week and he 
hoped all of nicaraguas 21 legal parties would participate 
opposition leaders say the reformed electoral laws still give 
the sandinistas an unfair advantage and sandinistas dominate the 
supreme electoral council 
washington has said it wants to keep the contras as an intact 
force until after the elections to make sure the balloting is free 
and fair

michael dukakis knew immediately he had made a 
serious error when he responded without emotion to a debate 
question about the possibility of his wife being raped and killed 
i blew it dukakis told an aide as he left the stage after 
last octobers debate with george bush according to a new book 
about the 1988 presidential race 
dukakis aides were baffled at his performance according to the 
authors because he had rehearsed an effective answer to a 
softoncrime question 13 times during debate preparations 
the story is recounted in the book by political columnists jack 
germond and jules witcover titled whose broad stripes and bright 
stars the trivial pursuit of the presidency 1988 
dukakis response widely criticized at the time was to a 
question posed by debate moderator bernard shaw of cnn who asked 
if he would favor the death penalty if his own wife kitty dukakis 
were raped and murdered 
no i dont bernard the candidate responded his voice as 
flat as if he were being asked about budget deficits and i think 
you know ive opposed the death penalty all of my life i dont see 
any evidence that its a deterrent and i think there are better 
and more effective ways to deal with violent crime weve done so 
in my own state 
dukakis bloodless answer captured the candidates most 
glaring vulnerabilities and helped put an end to any chance he 
had of defeating bush according to the book it said that as he 
walked off the debate stage in los angeles dukakis said to top 
aide john sasso i blew it 
germond and witcover write that the three other journalists who 
were on the debate panel were told of shaws question in advance 
were shocked by it and tried unsuccessfully to talk him into 
softening it 
advance copies of the book just published by warner books drew 
notice earlier this month for critical comments about vice 
president dan quayle that were attributed to quayles campaign 
aides president bush said last week he was offended by republican 
advisers quoted by germond and witcover who called quayle a 
lightweight and described him as having a childlike immaturity 
the book also describes the bush campaigns successful focus on 
a handful of issues used to create negative feelings among voters 
about dukakis the governor of massachusetts those issues included 
dukakis veto of a bill requiring students to say the pledge of 
allegiance his support for a law allowing convicted murderers to 
be furloughed from prison and opposition to the death penalty 
germond and witcover said bush campaign manager lee atwater and 
media adviser roger ailes identified those issues in the spring of 
1988 and made plans to use them despite bushs later suggestion 
that he used them in reaction to intense attacks on him at the 
democratic national convention in july 
they quote ailes as saying its only a matter of who hits 
first and who makes it stick my whole fear was that he 
dukakis had bigger negatives on us than we had on him 
the book describes ailes as playing a crucial role in coaching 
bush before a combative live interview with cbs anchorman dan 
rather a session hailed later by atwater as a defining event 
of the campaign it said ailes also suggested bushs use of 
republican primary opponent pete duponts given first name of 
pierre during a televised debate a reference that deflated 
duponts attempt to paint bush as an elitist

the government said thursday that rebels 
shot down a military transport plane killing 42 of the 48 people 
aboard but the rebels denied it 
a military official said the antonov26 was carrying government 
officials and some civilians from luena to cazombo in eastern 
moxico province sunday when a stinger antiaircraft missile fired 
by unita guerrillas hit the left engine 
he said the twinengine plane crashed in the bush about 25 miles 
west of cazombo 
the washington office of unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola issued a statement denying responsibility 
unita suspects that a faction of the mpla government not 
supportive of the negotiation process is responsible for placing 
the blame on unita it said unita remains committed to the 
spirit of gbadolite and will continue to negotiate in good faith 
western diplomats who follow the angolan situation from lisbon 
said they thought the plane might have been shot down by a unita 
faction that did not concur with the agreement reached june 22 at 
gbadolite zaire 
it looks like the mpla came out of last weeks round of 
negotiations well and some more extreme elements of unita could be 
trying to up the military pressure to gain more leverage in the 
next round one said 
mpla stands for popular movement for the liberation of angola 
the marxist faction that won a civil war after independence from 
portugal in 1975 and has governed angola since 
officials on the sovietbuilt plane apparently were bound for 
cazombo as part of a program to explain the truce the military 
informant said 
angolas government and the rebels accuse each other of 
violating a ceasefire that began two days after the agreement and 
lasted only a week 
the portuguese news agency lusa said a woman and a 15yearold 
were among the six survivors of the crash and that the municipal 
commissioner of cazombo was killed 
it quoted an angolan military source not identified as saying 
this is more than a ceasefire violation it said reports of 
unita actions had increased over the weekend 
antonov26 aircraft often are used to transport government 
soldiers around angola which is twice the size of france 
lusa quoted the military source as saying increased rebel 
activity might cause the government to postpone the next round of 
talks scheduled for monday in zaire 
angop the official angolan news agency said rebels attacked 
and occupied quimbele and cuimba towns in northern uige province 
near zaire last sunday 
the military official said unita forces ambushed vehicles monday 
in lunda south province killing 16 people and fired mortars at 
kuito capital of bie province killing two or three people 
quimbele has been considered a possible northern base for unita 
which has a southern stronghold at jamba

president bush said tuesday that he was 
extending steel import quotas for another 30 months but he also 
served notice on the steel industry that the trade protection would 
expire afterward 
the president said the 2year extension of the import quotas 
would give us trade representative carla hills time to negotiate 
an end to unfair steel subsidies provided by other countries 
i am mindful of the need to improve the availability of steel 
in the united states and to promote price competition bush said 
bushs decision will affect 29 countries that have negotiated 
socalled voluntary restraint agreements with the united states 
under those agreements japan south korea brazil the 
12nation european community and 14 other countries agreed to limit 
their imports of steel to 184 percent of the us market 
the quotas were first imposed by the reagan administration in 
1984 and had been scheduled to expire on sept 30 
the steel industry had lobbied for a fiveyear extention of the 
import limits contending that more time was needed to allow the 
domestic industry to complete its modernization 
however a coalition of steel users representing groups ranging 
from us auto companies to farmers had urged the administration 
to let the quotas expire on schedule arguing that the restaints 
had cost american consumers millions of dollars and lost more jobs 
than they had saved 
bushs advisers were deeply split over the issue one faction 
argued that the us steel industry had raked in 2 billion in 
profits last year and no longer needed protection others argued 
that us steel producers still faced stiff competition from 
governmentsubsidized industries in other countries 
there was never any question that bush would agree to extend 
quotas four days before last novembers presidential election 
bush sent a letter to sen john heinz rpa pledging to do so 
heinz however complained that the president had undercut 
hills negotiating position by fixing a date for the end of quotas 
the chances are slim to none that even the most determined 
us negotiators can end a generation of foreign government 
subsidizing and unfair practices in a mere 2 years heinz said 
the presidents negotiators have only 30 months to achieve a goal 
that has eluded us for 20 years 
jon jenson a spokesman for the 300member coalition of american 
steel using manufacturers said the action was a reasonable 
compromise 
it is a positive step away from protection and toward a more 
competitive steel market in the united states he said 
but lynn williams president of the united steelworkers of 
america said bushs action had fallen short of his campaign 
promise 
our members have already made deep concessions to help the 
industry survive but we have found the government to be 
unwilling to respond to a systematic malaise of unfair foreign 
steel practices williams said 
reagans decision to impose steel restaints came after an 
industryunion coalition mounted an extensive lobbying campaign 
tied to the 1984 election the quotas succeeded in reducing imports 
from 265 percent of the american market in 1984 to 207 percent 
last year 
last year the american steel industry operated at nearly 90 
percent of its capacity major users of steel such as caterpillar 
inc complained that the quotas had increased the cost of american 
steel and made their products made from steel less competitive on 
overseas markets 
bushs quota extention will allow the foreign marketshare to 
rise by one percentage point per year until quotas are phased out 
entirely on march 31 1992 
hills said the increase would be allocated each year to those 
countries which have done the most to eliminate subsidies 
bush instructed the commerce deparmtent to streamline a 
socalled short supply mechanism that allows us steel users to 
bypass the quotas if the type of steel they need is in short supply 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski praised 
bushs proposal for attempting to strike a careful balance 
between producers and consumers but he said he would reserve 
judgement on whether to support the proposed extension until his 
committee held hearings on the subject 
the legislative authority for the current voluntary restraint 
agreements expires sept 30 
members of the congressional steel caucus said they were 
disappointed that the president did not extend the import 
restraints for another five years 
his announcement of 2 years is only half the pie said rep 
joseph gaydos dpa 
rep john murtha dpa said the presidents announcement was 
a partial recognition that the steel program has been a 
success but he said 2 years fails to recognize that more 
remains to be done 
the steel industry needs five years he said because the 
unfair trading practices that brought about the program in 1984 
still exist

congressional committees approved six bills 
tuesday providing money in the next fiscal year for federal efforts 
ranging from aids research to enhanced security at vice president 
dan quayles mansion 
the house appropriations committee approved an 184 billion 
measure for the treasury postal service and a slew of other 
agencies a 1552 billion bill for the departments of health and 
human services labor and education and a 58 billion package for 
the departments of commerce justice state and the federal 
judiciary 
across the capitol the senate appropriations committee passed 
bills containing 44 billion for agriculture programs 18 billion 
for energy and water projects and 105 billion for the interior 
department and for federal cultural programs 
all six bills covering operations for fiscal 1990 were 
approved on voice votes 
the days work was emblematic of lawmakers steppedup pace as 
they race to complete as much budget business as they can before 
their fourweek summer recess begins aug 5 the 1990 federal 
fiscal year begins oct 1 and congress will have only four weeks 
of work left until then when it returns in september 
so far the full house has approved five of the 13 annual 
appropriations bills needed to keep the government functioning 
while the senate has yet to approve any 
the treasurypostal service legislation provides 23 billion 
more than this years spending level and just 6 million more than 
president bush sought in the budget he submitted to congress in 
february 
it contains 21 million for security improvements at the vice 
presidents official residence in washington 
on a 2926 partyline vote republicans added an amendment 
prohibiting enforcement of section 89 a provision of the tax code 
that forces companies to offer health plans to lowerpaid employees 
that are equivalent to those given to executives businesses have 
complained that the law is costly and timeconsuming for them 
the laborhealth measure boosts jobtraining spending by 238 
million over this year to nearly 4 billion builds aids spending 
by 25 percent to 16 billion devotes 16 billion for drug 
counseling and education efforts and provides 180 million for the 
homeless 102 million more than this year 
the commercejustice measure would provide 50 million for 
reparations to japaneseamericans who were interred during world 
war ii the bill originally contained 20 million for the payments 
but 30 million more was transferred for the fund on a voice vote 
from the amount slated to go to the census bureau under the 1988 
law that authorized 12 billion in payments to the surviving 500 
million was to be paid next year but lawmakers cited budget 
constraints 
the agriculture bill increases spending on child nutrition 
programs from 498 million in 1989 to 715 million and ignores a 
bush proposal to cut the agricultural extension service and instead 
raises it from 361 million this year to 367 million 
the energy and water measure provides 225 million for the 
superconducting super collider the researchoriented atom smasher 
that the government plans to build in texas for a total cost of 
about 6 billion the amount is 25 million more than the house has 
already voted for of the total 135 million would be to begin 
construction and 90 million would be for research and development 
the bill also includes 96 billion for nuclear energy defense 
activities and 42 billion for water projects 
the interior legislation increases the national park services 
coffers from 734 million this year to 771 million and holds the 
national endowment for the arts to 143 million about 1 million

the bush administration announced tuesday it 
would give 2 million in emergency aid to lebanon but rejected 
suggestions that it send naval vessels to protect supply shipments 
against the possibility of syrian attack 
the emergency assistance was approved by president bush at the 
request of the international committee for the red cross to provide 
food and medical supplies for victims of the countrys 15year 
civil war 
the united states is also providing 14 million worth of food 
through voluntary organizations to feed about 400000 lebanese 
affected by the fighting which is pitting iraqibacked christian 
troops against syrianbacked moslem and druse militias 
details of the us aid were released by assistant secretary of 
state for middle eastern affairs john kelly to the house 
subcommittee on europe and the middle east 
kelly outlined the administrations lebanon policy after 
witnesses from private lebaneseamerican organizations described 
acute shortages of food and fuel triggered by the civil wars worst 
round of fighting which began last march 
he denied contentions by some of the witnesses that us food 
supplies were being diverted by syrian troops who have mounted a 
naval blockade of christiancontrolled ports along the 
mediterranean coast in retaliation for a christian blockade of 
moslemcontrolled ports 
in response to a question from the panels chairman rep lee 
hamilton dind whether the administration had considered an 
armed naval escort of the supply ships kelly said 
i doubt very seriously that there would be much support in the 
congress for the active involvement of us warships in attempting 
to break this blockade i think this blockade can be eliminated 
through persuasion and diplomacy 
the thrust of us policy is to lobby in the arab world 
including in communications with syria and iraq for acceptance of 
an arab league initiative to bring about a ceasefire and a lifting 
of the blockades kelly said the sixweek effort has failed to 
yield results he conceded 
we are waiting for an arab league decision an arab league 
action there is no us initiative there is no us separate 
plan these are the people who have a realistic chance of solving 
the problem there kelly said

the independent counsel in the irancontra 
investigation said tuesday the justice department is jeopardizing 
the case against a former cia station chief by making piecemeal 
appeals that have delayed the trial 
in a strongly worded letter to the justice department lawrence 
walsh also suggested that the cia is raising unjustified concerns 
that scuttled mondays scheduled starting date in the trial of 
joseph fernandez 
the spy agency objects to plans by fernandezs lawyers to 
identify two cia stations and one cia facility in latin america 
the justice department acting on the cias concerns won a 
temporary stay of the trial from a federal appeals court judge in 
richmond va 
cia stations exist in latin american countries walsh said 
in a letter to the justice department this is a wellknown fact 
the attorney general must decide whether it is so necessary to 
preserve an artificial deniability that he should block the 
prosecution of a highranking cia officer walshs letter said 
walsh said the prospect that such information would be disclosed 
by fernandez at his trial doesnt warrant the justice departments 
filing of a national security affidavit such an affidavit would 
bar use of the information in fernandezs trial and could kill the 
case 
attorney general dick thornburgh unwilling so far to take the 
drastic step of filing an affidavit instead sought the stay from 
the appeals court 
the independent counsels office is generally unwilling to 
interrupt trials in order to take piecemeal appeals on 
matters concerning classified information said walshs letter to 
acting deputy attorney general edward dennis 
walsh said the justice departments actions inevitably disrupt 
the trial alienate the us district court in alexandria va 
where the fernandez trial is supposed to take place and 
jeopardize a successful prosecution 
the prosecutor called on the justice department to file the 
affidavit walshs office could then appeal any rulings regarding 
the affidavit 
walsh was responding to a letter earlier in the day from dennis 
in it dennis said walshs suggestion that an affidavit be filed 
is premature and needlessly imperils not only the governments 
ability to challenge erroneous rulings relating to classified 
information but also the future viability of your prosecution 
dennis said that the prosecutors office should have appealed 
mondays ruling by us district court judge claude hilton who is 
presiding in the fernandez case 
hilton rejected proposals by the government to substitute 
numbers for the identities of the cia stations and facilities in 
latin america and to abandon most of one criminal charge against 
fernandez in exchange for dropping references in open court to 
three highly sensitive cia programs 
fernandez the agencys former station chief in costa rica is 
accused of four criminal charges focusing on his alleged lies to 
irancontra investigators about his assistance to oliver norths 
resupply network for the nicaraguan rebels

president bush on tuesday lauded the 
achievements of a group of young people from poor backgrounds who 
succeeded with help from a jobs program the administration wants to 
reauthorize and strengthen 
since 1983 the job training partnership act has propelled 
americas engine providing education and training for those 
lacking in basic skills or who are economically disadvantaged 
the president said in a rose garden ceremony 
he presented achievement awards to 12 young adults who had 
limited education and skills and were from economically depressed 
home situations all of them gained training instruction or 
education through the jtpa a program that provides federal funds 
to assist local governments and private industry in giving job 
training and employment for such young people as well as dislocated 
workers 
the 24 billion jobs program was coauthored by sen edward 
kennedy dmass and vice president dan quayle who as a 
republican senator from indiana claimed the jobs program as his 
chief legislative achievement 
the program has been criticized for achieving more quick job 
placement for those with limited skllls who can be trained quickly 
rather than more complete training for the most needy and unskilled 
and directing them into careers 
to shift the programs focus the administration is proposing 
that instead of spending most of the money on the unemployed who 
might not be unskilled the focus will shift more to the percentage 
of unskilled poor 
theres a general consensus that we can improve this to help 
redirect the focus to help those most in need said white house 
spokesman steve hart 
the proposed revisions are being considered along with 
reauthorization for the jobs program 
the outstanding achievement awards were instigated by the 
department of labor to commend those who complete training through 
the program and succeed at jobs 
one of the women honored tuesday purtillia bryant 21 
recounted how she had come from a broken home in north carolina to 
washington she said she could not get a job and had few skills 
from her high school education i was angry about my situation 
and had no selfconfidence and felt rejected she said 
she was referred to a washington program funded by the jtpa the 
opportunities industrialization center where she has improved her 
typing and studied computer science english and math she is 
working as a navy clerktypist and at night for a car rental agency 
to save money for college and to eventually go into the computer 
technology field 
her story shows bush said how tomorrow can be brighter than 
today 
examples of the efforts the jobs program funds are summer youth 
programs and aid for workers laid off by plant closings 
the administration is proposing to amend the program targeting 
the aid to the most needy applicants 
the amendments are similar to changes that were proposed by 
democrats 
sen paul simon dill who is chairman of the senate panel 
that oversees the jtpa has proposed several revisions saying 
the vehicle is sound but some of our neediest citizens have been 
left behind

company and union leaders made lastminute 
campaign pushes tuesday on the eve of a vote to decide whether 
nissan will be the first japanese car plant organized by the united 
auto workers 
about 2400 workers at the plant south of nashville were to 
begin voting wednesday to determine whether the uaw will represent 
nissan motor manufacturing co usa employees 
nissan claimed by closedcircuit television within the plant 
that uaw representation could mean a loss of benefits while the 
union used radio commercials to hammer away at its theme of plant 
safety 
labor observers say the election could be a makeorbreak 
situation for the uaw which has yet to gain a foothold at any 
major japanese plants in the united states except those affiliated 
with american automakers 
three years ago the union lost badly in an effort to organize 
the honda motor co plant in marysville ohio 
only 135 percent of tennessees manufacturing work force is 
unionized and uaw membership has declined 33 percent over the past 
decade 
uaw spokesman maxey irwin said tuesday that the elections 
importance has been blown out of proportion 
the significance to us has to do with the problems that nissan 
employees have theyre suffering a very brutal assembly line 
speed and high injury rate irwin said 
as far as the national significance i fail to understand 
exactly how a win or a loss for the uaw in smyrna tenn will 
affect an organizing drive in salina kan or tyler texas or 
eugene ore 
the company has disputed the unions claim of safety problems 
although it drew a 5000 fine from tennessee authorities for 
refusing to show its injury log to a group of workers the fine is 
now under appeal 
nissans inplant video messages blamed the union for layoffs at 
general motors and they promised tough bargaining sessions if the 
uaw wins 
the next thing that would happen if the union won is that the 
company would start dealing with the union and not you about what 
your wages benefits and working conditions would be said an 
audio copy of one tape obtained by the nashville banner 
the tape said employees should be concerned about strikes and 
that a strike could hurt workers more than nissan television 
reports of strike violence and unsuccessful strikes are included in 
the videotape which the uaw said has not been shown to suspected 
union supporters 
this tape is a use of threats to intimidate employees into 
voting no said frank joyce union spokesman 
the idea that somehow nissan is currently in a bargaining 
relationship on an individual basis with workers is pretty 
absurd joyce said nissan employees do not set their own 
wages benefits or working conditions 
if they want to declare in advance that they will be hard to 
bargain with were used to that 
nissan officials declined to comment on the tape tuesday

william j bennett who is devising an 
antidrug strategy for the nation said tuesday that carrots and 
sticks will be used to encourage states to impose stiff drug 
policies 
there will be some carrots and some sticks bennett the 
director of the office of national drug control policy told 
reporters at a luncheon 
we will expect states to do certain things if they want 
federal funds he said we will expect educational institutions 
to finally do certain things if they want education funds 
bennett would not say exactly what the states will be required 
to do to keep federal money under the drug strategy that is due 
sept 5 a draft of the plan is being reviewed by various agencies 
including the national security council he said 
the focus of the national drug control strategy would be crack 
a cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine said bennett 
thats not to say the other drugs arent important and serious 
but the clearest most immediate danger to the largest number 
of people comes from crack he said 
its crack that is responsible for the disorder in many of our 
cities its crack which is endangering the lives of so many 
innocent civilians because of the tendency for violence its crack 
which is appearing with terrible frequency as the drug sought out 
by pregnant addicts 
while people seem to be turning away from many other drugs he 
said that is not the case with crack crack from all evidence 
is getting worse 
bennett said the strategy will not include any recommendation on 
semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons 
as you know he said the president asked me to think 
about that give him my advice about it i did that some time ago 
and my advice is between me and the president 
in march at bennetts urging the treasury department suspended 
the import of dozens of styles of the firearms the departments 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms earlier this month made the 
ban permanent for 43 styles including the popular chinesemade 
ak47 and the israelimade uzi carbine 
last week bennett urged the american legislative exchange 
council a gathering of state legislators to take a number of 
steps to combat drug abuse in their home states 
specifically he called on them to ensure certain and prompt 
punishment of those convicted of using or trafficking in drugs 
action that will require the states to hire more police judges and 
prosecutors and to build new prisons 
the legislators he said must make sure there are minimum 
mandatory sentences for drug trafficking harsh sentences for 
anyone caught selling drugs to children or using children to sell 
drugs and hold both casual and heavy drug users accountable for 
their drug use including civil fines of up to 10000 for those 
convicted of possession of small amounts of drugs 
the states also should employ asset forfeiture laws and should 
make parole and probation contingent on frequent mandatory drug 
tests he said in addition they must support sound treatment 
programs and demand accountability from the treatment programs to 
ensure that they work 
states also bennett said must insist that public employers 
take personnel action against employees caught using drugs or under 
the influence of drugs while on the job 
bennett did not indicate tuesday which of these steps states 
must take to keep federal funds flowing

syrian and christian forces exchanged 
machinegun fire across beiruts dividing green line tuesday during 
a lull in artillery battles and civilians fearing new bombardments 
reinforced their shelters 
police said a woman was wounded by sniper fire in the ein 
rummaneh district of christian east beirut 
that raised the casualty toll after 19 weeks of fighting to 453 
killed and 1860 wounded 
the crackle of machinegun fire echoing through the capitals 
deserted streets kept tension high 
families who have not fled the ferocious shelling by both sides 
prepared for a new outbreak of heavy artillery exchanges 
i want to be ready when the shelling starts again said 
sunni moslem gift shop owner bassem itani as he filled plastic bags 
with sand in the sanayeh neighborhood of moslem west beirut 
most of the people around here have left ive no place to go 
except my apartment here my wife and i have decided to stay he 
said 
itani said the underground shelter in his building was well 
equipped to protect us but im fortifying the ventilation holes 
with sand bags to protect us from shrapnel 
beirut remained a ghost town tuesday an estimated 250000 of 
its 15 million residents have fled in recent days during ferocious 
artillery duels between the christians and syrians who support 
lebanons moslem factions 
police estimate that 700000 people from both sectors have fled 
since march when the fighting between the forces led by christian 
leader gen michel aoun and the syrian army broke out 
the usually crowded beaches along the moslem sectors seaside 
boulevard were empty elsewhere frightened beirut citizens traded 
rumors about when the feared artillery battles will resume 
the moslemrun voice of the nation radio sought to dampen the 
fears saying the rumors were baseless and speculative 
one of the most common rumors said aoun set a tuesday deadline 
to resume shelling attacks against the syrians if a threemember 
arab league mediating committee failed to produce a settlement to 
the conflict 
a spokesman for aoun denied reports of a deadline 
the general has confidence in the arab summit committee and in 
its sincere efforts to contain the deterioration the spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity he refused to elaborate 
king fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of morocco and 
president chadli bendjedid of algeria were charged by an arab 
summit may 26 with finding a settlement to lebanons 14yearold 
civil war by november 
but so far they have not even been able to enforce a ceasefire 
called in may 
saudi information minister ali alshaer told reporters in jiddah 
that fahd has appealed for all parties in lebanon to stop fighting 
to give peace efforts a chance 
the arab league committee on lebanon is doing its utmost to 
save the country but this will not be achieved unless all parties 
concerned show their goodwill and sincere cooperation to achieve 
peace shaer quoted the monarch as telling a weekly cabinet 
meeting in jiddah 
the fighting broke out march 8 two days after aoun blockaded 
illegal ports run by syrianbacked moslem militias south of beirut 
in an attempt to restore longeroded government authority 
the syrians and their moslem allies retaliated by besieging and 
shelling the 310squaremile christian enclave home to 1 million 
people 
the syrians who have 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate and their allies outnumber 
aouns estimated 20000 men by about 31

president bush gave assurances tuesday that 
senate restrictions on us contacts with the palestine liberation 
organization will be taken into account as the united states 
pursues its dialogue with yasser arafats group 
but he also emphasized that he considers the restrictions to be 
unconstitutional and an infringement on his conduct of us 
diplomacy 
bush did not explicitly rule out us meetings with salah 
khalaf who is secondincommand to plo chairman arafat or other 
officials suspected of either plotting or carrying out terrorist 
acts against americans 
concern over us dealings with arafats aide known also as abu 
iyad prompted the senate to approve an amendment last week 
restricting us contacts with the plo abu iyad is suspected of 
masterminding the murder of 11 israeli athletes at the munich 
olympics in 1972 and the slaying of two american diplomats in the 
sudan in 1973 
the amendment was watered down before its 971 passage to ease 
requirements for bush to report to congress and to scrap a 
prohibition on talking to accomplices in terrorism 
the lone dissenter was sen jesse helms rnc who wanted to 
tighten the restrictions 
the state department in an unusual move announced bushs 
position in a statement by spokeswoman margaret tutwiler it was 
issued after secretary of state james a baker iii had talked to 
the president and to several senators 
the president strongly believes that legislation that tries to 
restrict or manage the conduct of diplomacy is an infringement on 
presidential prerogatives and is unconstitutional the statement 
said 
while we will continue to view the plo amendment to the state 
authorization bill and provisions like it as unconstitutional he 
acknowledges the widespread sentiment in the congress that produced 
this legislation 
members of congress should know that this sentiment and 
concern will be taken into account as we pursue our policy 
the statement also said unnamed sources who suggest otherwise 
do not speak for the administration 
a report saturday in the washington post said administration 
officials had refused to bar further meetings with salah khalaf 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified department official as saying 
the legislation doesnt rule out anything 
the united states broke its diplomatic isolation of the plo last 
december after arafat at the urging of the state department 
publicly renounced terrorism and said he accepted israels right to 
exist 
several meetings have been held since then in tunisia the most 
recent sought to weaken plo resistance to an israeli plan to hold 
elections on the west bank and in gaza to chose palestinians for 
negotiations 
the plo opposes the plan as a ploy to prevent a palestinian 
state there is no indication arafats group has changed its mind

the government on tuesday rejected 
senegals accusations that mauritania is deporting its own black 
minority and accused its southern neighbor of refusing to accept 
senegalese sent home from mauritania 
in a letter to the un security council mauritania also 
accused senegal of the execution of a premeditated plan against 
mauritania and against mauritanians living in senegal whose goods 
have been pillaged and who have been victims of massacres and 
bodily harm of all kinds 
senegal wrote to the security council on thursday setting out 
its charges but not seeking immediate council action 
tension between the west african neighbors erupted last april 
after a clash along their shared river border violence broke out 
in both capitals against nationals of the other country officials 
estimate between 250 to more than 400 people were killed 
mauritanias information minister mohamed lemine ould ahmed 
issued a separate statement tuesday denying related allegations by 
the human rights organization amnesty international of torture 
killings and arbitrary arrests by mauritanian security forces 
amnesty international accuses us of certain deeds which in 
reality are the crimes which senegal has committed and continues 
to commit against mauritanian citizens he said 
he urged the londonbased group to concern itself instead with 
the situation of thousands of mauritanians still held hostage in 
senegal in inhuman conditions 
each government blames the other for the violence and for not 
protecting the goods and lives of each others citizens 
about 20 percent of mauritanias 2 million people are black 
with the rest mainly arabs and berbers senegals population of 67 
million is almost entirely black 
after the worst of the violence subsided senegal reported black 
mauritanians were arriving in large numbers after being deported 
from their native country 
in just a few weeks the operation in question has affected 
some 26000 individuals who have been driven from their own 
country solely by reason of their ethnic origin and been deported 
to senegal arriving completely stripped of their property

a leader of orthodox rabbis from the united 
states said tuesday an israeli supreme court ruling that 
nonorthodox conversions to judaism are valid was a travesty 
that would increase divisions among jews 
members of the israeli parliament from religious parties 
threatened to renew demands for a who is a jew amendment 
reform and conservative leaders who note that their liberal 
branches of judaism have attracted more adherents in the united 
states described the court ruling as a victory 
interior minister aryeh deri said he would issue citizenship 
papers as ordered by the court but would withhold his signature 
deri ordered his ministry to produce special stickers for new 
identity cards saying information in the nationality and 
personal status sections could not be admitted as evidence by 
the orthodox rabbinical authorities 
secular legislators protested his action as a challenge to the 
rule of law 
in a 41 decision monday a supreme court panel upheld current 
israeli law and ordered the interior ministry to recognize as jews 
and give citizenship papers to a group of converts from the united 
states brazil and argentina 
before the court ruling deri had refused to issue papers until 
orthodox rabbis had validated the certificates of immigrants 
converted by reform or conservative rabbis 
harry horowitz an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
shamir had encouraged talks among rabbis of the three persuasions 
toward a compromise conversion formula that would resolve the who 
is a jew controversy 
the prime minister wants these discussions to go on so that 
these matter will no longer continue to divide or agitate the 
jewish people horowitz said in an interview 
rabbi max n schreier an orthodox rabbi from new york told a 
news conference recognizing nonorthodox converts is a travesty 
the fact that a judicial body recognizes something that goes 
against the essence of jewish law is a very disturbing matter 
schreier is president of the rabbinical assembly of america 
which represents about 15 million jews 
the who is a jew argument stems from orthodox demands that 
converts by reform and conservative rabbis be excluded from 
automatic israeli citizenship the orthodox argue that such 
conversions are invalid because they do not strictly conform to 
halacha or ancient jewish law 
avraham verdiger a legislator from agudat israel said his 
ultraorthodox party might withdraw support from shamirs 
government which could disturb the balance between the prime 
ministers rightwing likud bloc and the labor party its 
centerleft coalition partner agudat israel has five seats in the 
120member knesset 
verdiger also said his party would renew its campaign for a 
who is a jew amendment that would change israels law of return 
and grant automatic citizenship only to jews converted according to 
halacha effectively only to orthodox converts the knesset has 
defeated about a dozen such measures 
israeli law now defines a jew as a person who was born of a 
jewish mother or who has converted and does not profess another 
faith

a proplo palestinian lawyer 
said tuesday he had talks with prime minister yitzhak shamir 
fueling speculation israels government is breaking its own ban on 
contact with the outlawed group 
lawyer jamil tarifi said he was invited to meet shmuel goren 
government coordinator for the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
and was taken without advance notice to shamirs office 
the meeting occurred several days ago tarifi said 
declining to give the date 
his name was among those of four palestinians leaked in israel 
and made public by the palestine liberation organization in tunis 
as having held secret talks with shamir the others have denied any 
contact 
when reports first surfaced monday shamir spokesman avi pazner 
insisted the premier held several meetings only with nonplo 
palestinians 
asked about tarifis statements pazner said the prime 
minister reserves to himself the right not to reveal with whom he 
met neither the content of the talks and especially what the 
palestinian participants said 
he added i want to stress what tarifi says himself that he 
did not get any green light from the plo and that he is not a plo 
member 
but leftist legislator yossi sarid told israel radio tarifi was 
forbidden to run for mayor of ramallahs elbireh suburb because he 
was a member of plo chief yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction 
tarifi was elbirehs deputy mayor from 1976 to 1982 
at the news conference at his home in ramallah the 42yearold 
lawyer described himself as a plo supporter of course but 
declined to say whether he has direct contact with plo leaders 
but he added nothing happens in the occupied territories 
without the knowledge of the plo it is the leadership of the 
people 
tarifis disclosure could further fuel a feud in shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc 
earlier this month likud hardliners forced shamir to accept 
conditions for his peace initiative ruling out many possible 
concessions to the palestinians 
after the leftleaning labor party threatened to leave the 
governing coalition shamir backed off and reaffirmed the original 
plan 
arafat himself was quoted monday as saying israels government 
has opened direct contacts with his group over the peace plan 
shamirs plan calls for elections in the west bank and gaza 
strip to select palestinians to open talks with israel on an 
interim settlement to calm the 19month palestinian uprising 
in the latest uprising casualty tuesday arab hospital officials 
and the army said 20yearold fawsi mohammed elidawil died of 
gunshot wounds suffered a day earlier bringing to 520 the toll of 
palestinians killed in clashes with israelis during the revolt 
thirtyeight israelis also have been killed 
arab hospital officials said at least 18 palestinians were shot 
and wounded in clashes in the west bank and gaza strip tuesday 
in gaza city 70yearold fatma mohammed badwan died of a heart 
attack suffered when israeli soldiers broke into her house in 
search of stonethrowers early tuesday the hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the circumstances of the death and said a 
military doctor tried to revive the woman 
the hebrew daily maariv on tuesday quoted shamir as expressing 
fear that disclosure of his meeting with tarifi could damage 
efforts to speak with other palestinians who would be afraid for 
their lives maariv reported monday that shamir and tarifi had 
met 
the other palestinians named in the tunis report are jerusalem 
journalist mahmoud abu zuluf gaza businessman mansour alshawwa 
and west bank pharmacist ezziddin alaryan 
all are known supporters of the plo and alaryan is a member of 
the palestine national council the plo parliament 
tarifi said he did not know why plo officials in tunis had 
published the names of the palestinians who had held talks with 
shamir 
nablus businessman said kennaan said tuesday that the popular 
front for the liberation of palestine an extremist plo faction led 
by george habash has warned supporters of arafats fatah wing not 
to meet with israeli officials israel tv reported 
it did not elaborate and kennaan could not be reached for 
comment 
tarifi said shamir urged palestinians to accept his elections 
plan even if it did not make clear what the final status of the 
territories would be and the plo has called for linkage to an 
independent state 
tarifi also said he told shamir to deal with the plo 
the plo will accept it the plan or it will not be acceptable 
to the palestinian people he said he told shamir

environmentalists said tuesday they would 
fight legislation that would impose a 14month ceasefire in the 
battle over logging in the ancient forests of washington state and 
oregon 
it would be news if we rolled over and played dead on this 
one rich hoppe a spokesman for the wilderness society said 
after the senate appropriations committee approved the legislation 
as an amendment to the interior spending bill for the next fiscal 
year 
we are going to try and fight it on the floor said hoppe 
adding that his organization was talking to a handful of senators 
who we have reason to believe might support us 
james monteith director of the oregon natural resources 
council said that while northwest senators believe they have the 
votes to put it down our throats the fight was far from over 
provisions in the legislation that would restrict appeals and 
judicial review of timber sales in the federal forests of the 
northwest have outraged many environmental groups and some 
lawmakers from outside the region 
sen patrick leahy dvt who had earlier raised concerns about 
the judicial review language in the legislation could play a key 
role in trying to stop the legislation said hoppe 
he has reserved his right to raise this issue on the senate 
floor but hasnt yet decided what he will do said jim cubie a 
leahy aide 
while some environmentalists were preparing for floor action 
which could come as early as wednesday morning others were urging 
a more cautious approach 
i think the most productive first step is to work with the 
sponsors said jim bloomquist the sierra clubs director of 
public lands programs 
jim pissot of the national audubon society said that while there 
was still time to make changes in the legislation he felt a floor 
fight was a possibility 
the timber industry was preparing for a struggle 
we take them at their word said mark rey a vice president 
of the national forest products association 
i find it difficult to believe the environmentalists are going 
to make this the armageddon of this congress given we are talking 
about only a 14month program said rey but it illustrates 
their continued intransigence in trying to find a reasonable 
solution 
the legislation would allow the sale of 10 billion board feet of 
timber in the federal forests of the northwest over the next 14 
months or about 10 percent under what was originally planned 
the plan also calls for not logging significant large blocks of 
oldgrowth forests a policy known as minimum fragmentation 
under the proposal significant stands of oldgrowth would be 
defined as having eight trees per acre that are at least 300 years 
old or are 40 inches in diameter 
the proposal also calls for environmentalists to agree to the 
release of 125 billion board feet of the almost 2 billion board 
feet of timber sales currently enjoined by federal courts in 
portland ore and seattle 
if environmentalists and the industry cannot agree to release 
that volume for sale by oct 1 the existing court injunctions 
would be dissolved legislatively and the forest service and blm in 
consultation with the fish and wildlife service and new citizen 
advisory boards would decide what timber would be sold 
the agreement also would prohibit environmentalists from using 
injunctions to block timber sales in the next fiscal year which 
starts oct 1 
the appropriations committee approved the legislation sponsored 
by sens mark hatfield rore and brock adams dwash on a 
voice vote

health secretary david mellor said tuesday he had 
approved a code of practice for using fetal tissue in brain cell 
transplants and research 
the guidelines drafted by doctors lawyers and moral 
philosophers forbid inducements to pregnant women to have 
abortions or to schedule them for the convenience of tissue 
transplant teams 
only isolated brain cells or fragments of tissue may be used to 
prevent the transfer of personality characteristics between donor 
and recipient the code says 
mellor told the house of commons the government would begin 
discussions with medical organizations on establishing a commission 
or agency to control the movement of fetal tissue 
that was suggested in a report that set out the guidelines and 
was prepared by a committee under the leadership of the rev dr 
john polkinghorne dean of trinity hall at cambridge university 
the committtee was appointed in june 1988 after doctors in 
birmingham announced britains first brain cell transplants using 
fetal tissue 
professor edward hitchcock head of the team said the 
operations had helped patients suffering from parkinsons disease 
a progressive brain disorder members of hitchcocks team are said 
to have performed at least 17 such operations 
they welcomed the polkinghorne report as did dr vivienne 
nathanson secretary of the ethics committee of the british medical 
association which represents most of britains 97000 doctors 
we believe it is important that new techniques are properly 
controlled publicly debated and regularly reviewed she said 
the polkinghorne report said fetal tissue may be used in 
research and treatment as long as a womans decision to have an 
abortion is clearly separated from any decision to use the tissue 
it said the health department should establish an organization 
to control the movement of fetal tissue and eliminate contact 
between abortion clinics and institutions where the tissue is used 
there should be no monetary exchange for fetuses or fetal 
tissue it said profit from any dealing in fetal tissue is 
unethical 
the report proposed that all new research or therapy involving 
the fetus or fetal tissue be approved by an ethics committee

former us attorney general edwin meese iii was 
at best incompetent and at worst corrupt a prosecutor said 
tuesday at the racketeering trial of meeses longtime friend e 
robert wallach 
assistant us attorney elliot b jacobson attacked the 
credibility of meese who testified for wallach in his closing 
arguments after 2 months of trial 
jacobson cited an internal justice department review that 
faulted meese for his efforts to help wallach in an illfated 
mideast oil pipeline proposal and to assist him with the wedtech 
corp a nowdefunct defense contractor 
wallach a san francisco personal injury lawyer was charged in 
a 21count racketeering indictment with extracting almost 2 
million in illegal payoffs and payments from wedtech including 
some 525000 in alleged bribes to wallach to influence meese and 
other government officials 
the other defendants are w franklyn chinn 47 a former wedtech 
board member and onetime meese financial adviser and a business 
associate of theirs r kent london 
meese testified that wallach never asked him to give 
preferential treatment to wedtech 
wedtech once a small machine shop grew into a 100 million 
government contractor through a special small business 
administration program that set aside contracts without competitive 
bidding for minoritycontrolled companies 
evidence at earlier trials has shown that wedtech continued to 
receive the nobid contracts through a series of bribe schemes even 
after it ceased to be a minorityowned company 
the wedtech investigation did not result in any criminal charges 
against meese but jacobson said as counsel to the president and 
as attorney general edwin meese iii was at best incompetent and at 
worst corrupt 
jacobson said meese used his testimony as a vehicle not only 
to vindicate his best friend but also himself 
jacobson said numerous character witnesses who testified about 
wallachs work for good causes did not know or chose to ignore 
his bad side 
that is the side of bob wallach that wanted money and wanted 
power and wanted both in the worst way he said money was the 
driving force in robert wallachs life 
jacobson also addressed the credibility of the prosecutions 
main witnesses including mario moreno a former wedtech vice 
chairman who has pleaded guilty in the case 
he said the witnesses were crooks but that their testimony 
was credible because they were at the center of the criminal 
conspiracy 
jacobson told the jurors not to believe defense arguments that 
corrupt wedtech officials took advantage of the defendants 
these are three sophisticated men they werent duped into 
anything he said 
defense closing arguments were scheduled for wednesday

the accuseds right to silence has been abused in 
criminal cases and should be restricted a government advisory 
panel said tuesday 
it is wrong that offenders usually the more intelligent and 
serious offenders should be able to manipulate the criminal 
justice system to their own advantage either to escape conviction 
entirely or to delay and obstruct the judicial process said a 
report prepared by the panel 
last year northern ireland ruled that courts could draw adverse 
inference if a defendant refused to answer questions the order was 
specifically intended to combat terrorism in the province 
at the time prime minister margaret thatchers government 
indicated that similar changes were intended in england and wales 
scotland has a separate legal system 
home secretary douglas hurd set a deadline of jan 25 1990 for 
comments on recommendations by the sixmember working panel 
the report adopts with reservations a recommendation made in 
1972 by the criminal law revision committee that juries and 
magistrates courts should be able to draw reasonable inferences 
from the accuseds silence 
but the panel also recommended 
statutory guidelines on factors the court will consider in 
drawing inferences from silence 
that failure to answer questions or to mention relevant facts 
should not amount to positive evidence of guilt 
developing a new explanation of rights to be read to suspects

top designers emanuel ungaro karl lagerfeld at 
chanel and louis feraud looked back tuesday to the gay nineties for 
inspiration in their couture shows for winter 1990 
otherwise they didnt have much in common except nostalgia 
ungaro centered his ideas somewhere between tartan taste and the 
tarty opulence of a cocotte 
the master draper indulged his penchant for piling on every rich 
fabric in the sewing basket his tightly draped silk blouses 
dresses and suits with fitted tartan jackets over flowered or 
checked tiny skirts had a certain ingenue appeal 
easier to wear were the pearly gray daytime pants suits in glen 
plaids or checks the jackets dressed up with puffy sleeves 
ungaros signature leg o mutton rhinestonebuttoned sleeves 
cropped up repeatedly 
for his hot fitted numbers with draped skirts hitched to reveal 
lots of leg he picked pink and blue duchess satins so electrically 
hot they hurt the eyes a lot of cocktail dresses came in 
variations on the lamebrocade themes so dear to all designers for 
next fall 
ungaro mixed this femalesiren scene up with velvet bows satin 
frills taffeta flounces wound around the body like a serpent plus 
acres of guipure lace and reembroidered velvet and silk 
it ended with the models turning like dresden china dolls on a 
music box offering a bonanza of flowered satins and silks in 
dresses with shepherdess sleeves crinolines bows and flowers not 
to mention marvelous beading sequin embroidery acres of ruffles 
and lace for good measure 
things were somewhat more refined though no less sexy at chanel 
where karl lagerfeld showed to an audience sweltering in marble 
halls without air conditioning in the palais de chaillot 
paloma picasso princess caroline of monaco and bernadette 
chirac wife of the mayor of paris appaluded lagerfelds fitted 
lines echoing edwardian or victorian times 
the topper defining the line from day to evening was a 
waspwaisted long riding jacket or redingote unveiled first in 
flame red decorated with black panels piping and grid effects over 
a narrow short skirt gloves throughout were a great little touch 
especially with big furry cuffs 
the chanel look got a nice update with bold stitching instead of 
piping and lots of diagonal pockets for a swinging look 
missing from the show was chanels top model ines de la 
fressange a chanel statement said she is ill though its rumored 
she quarreled with lagerfeld 
there were lovely surprises like the turquoise redingote over a 
bluegreen chiffon skirt 
and lagerfeld often left out the skirt altogether making the 
jacket into a minidress as in his readytowear 
the redingote sometimes was teamed with dressy cocktail numbers 
with strapless or spaghettistrapped bodices and lagerfeld like 
ungaro occasionally surprised with an electricpink jacket paired 
with a sarongwrapped skirt 
there was more of lagerfeld to this collection than chanel 
though pearls floppy neck bows and chain belts did appear the 
chanel camellia was all over the place but most flirtatious in a 
tulipscalloped skirt that looked too short to sit in 
there was retrospective romance in gold guipureincrusted 
jackets with satin skirts in fitted velvet bodices over full 
lacquered tulle or lameflowered skirts in romantic lace dresses 
in shades of orange toast and pearl gray 
the most wonderful evening gown was a bodyhugging pearl pink 
satin mermaid sheath worn with a fitted redingote topper of course 
louis feraud seemed to look back to circa 1930 with brightly 
embroidered cloche hats pleated skirts swinging four inches above 
the ankle boleros and an occasional peplum jacket 
his big trapeze coats with cutout appliques looked mountainous 
but his patchwork outfits in jewel colors glowed with good fun 
and the multicolored flowered cloque laquered silk coatdress 
topped with black fox definitely had the stamp of feraud the artist 
the romantic edwardians here were swathed in acres of fluted and 
pleated organza ruffs 
and feraud turned out some breathtaking jeweled and beaded 
sheaths paved in gold bronze and copper topped by pearls and amber 
and topaz stones 
after all the nostalgia romance and opulence everywhere else 
the guy laroche collection by angelo tarlazzi looked so understated 
the creator didnt seem to imbue it with the clout of true couture 
one would like to praise tarlazzi chosen by laroche himself to 
succeed him when he died but the capable designer with his own 
paris readytowear firm stayed so far on the cautious side it 
looked more like a dirge than a celebratory collection in memory of 
laroche 
the most striking of his plain clothes were backless black 
cocktail dresses in emulation of laroche who created a sensation 
with one he designed for film star mireille darc a quarter century 
ago

serbia has proposed sweeping changes 
in yugoslavias constitution that would increase the powers of the 
federal government and protect human rights the tanjug news agency 
reported tuesday

and efficient federation according to tanjug 
it reported the commission said the federal government must be 
able to ensure a unified economic market have control over 
national defense and security matters have exclusive power to 
conduct foreign policy set the goals of a scientific research 
program and ensure environmental protection

independent judiciary as one of the basic democratic 
institutions 
the proposals the first to be set out officially by any of 
yugoslavias six republics and two provinces states serbias views 
on a new constitution scheduled to be adopted within two years 
yugoslavias other republics say postworld war ii yugoslavia 
was founded on the basis of full equality of all of the regions and 
they oppose many of the serbian proposals serbia is the largest 
and most populous republic and the other regions say the proposal 
would give serbia an unfair advantage 
under the present constitution the republics have a wide degree 
of autonomy in economic and political matters 
the constitution adopted in 1974 under the late josip broz 
tito the founder of communist yugoslavia has been blamed by many

unemployment in a struggling economy and the political leaders in 
the six republics have been unable to reach agreement on moves to 
overcome the crisis 
the serbian statement did not call for a multiparty system 
which has been demanded by some serbian liberals opposed to 
communist party domination but said the possibility of other 
forms of pluralist political organization should not be 
excluded 
it also proposed creation of a legislature with the members 
elected by universal suffrage under the present consitution equal 
numbers of deputies are elected by each republic

saudi financier adnan khashoggi can be released 
on 10 million bail if he wears an electronic bracelet while he 
awaits trial on charges he helped ferdinand and imelda marcos 
allegedly plunder the philippines a federal judge ruled tuesday 
khashoggi 53 once among the worlds wealthiest men has been 
jailed since he was extradited from switzerland last wednesday 
the court recognizes that no precautions including pretrial 
detention ever conclusively guarantee a defendants presence at 
trial wrote us district judge john keenan in his ruling but 
the judge said the court believed the substantial bail and the 
restrictions of his freedom would assure that khashoggi would 
appear at trial 
keenan also said khashoggi was unlikely to flee because it would 
have a ruinous impact upon his ability to conduct business 
his lawyer robert morvillo said tuesday enough money had been 
raised to meet the bail but that paperwork prevented khashoggis 
immediate release from the metropolitan correctional center in 
manhattan 
the following conditions to khashoggis release were imposed by 
the judge 
the posting of a 10 million bond half of which will be 
secured by cash or bank books and the other half by property or a 
bond the bond is to have two financially secure cosigners 
one of whom is to be his brother essam khashoggi 
khashoggis movements will be monitored by federal marshals 
with an unremovable electronic bracelet attached to his wrist or 
ankle 
he is to report twice a week in person and daily by phone to 
officials 
khashoggi must surrender his passport and stay within the 
southern district of new york which includes manhattan and its 
northern suburbs pending the outcome of the case 
in setting the high bail the judge said khashoggi was an 
enormously wealthy man who possesses the means to procure 
staggering amounts of cash in fewer than 24 hours 
a federal grand jury in new york indicted khashoggi the 
marcoses five other people and the california overseas bank in los 
angeles last october the ousted president and his wife were 
charged with stealing more than 100 million from the philippine 
treasury to buy real estate and art in new york 
khashoggi who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the 
assets as a cover was indicted on racketeering conspiracy mail 
fraud and obstruction of justice 
he was extradited only for mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
because the swiss government denied extradition on the other 
charges which are not recognized under swiss law 
khashoggi faces up to five years in jail and a 250000 fine on 
each of the two charges 
he is said to have been the main financier and middleman of the 
irancontra affair in which proceeds of secret us arms sales to 
iran were channeled to rebels fighting the leftist sandinista 
government in nicaragua 
khashoggi also has been named in several kickback scandals but 
his arrest in switzerland on april 18 marked the first time he had 
been jailed 
prosecutors say the earliest trial date for khashoggi and his 
codefendants would be january or february

president bush who campaigned for president 
with a slogan of adoption not abortion is urging government 
managers to find ways to support and accommodate employees who want 
to adopt children 
bush in a memorandum directed all department and agency heads to 
be as flexible as possible on arranging adoptionrelated leaves 
print adoption articles in agency newsletters honor national 
adoption week in november and use employee assistance programs to 
help workers considering adoption or who have a family member 
facing a crisis pregnancy 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater on tuesday 
explained the presidents motivation in the directive 
bush simply feels very strongly in adoption that its one of 
the answers to the abortion problem and as part of a general 
concern about family values fitzwater said 
bush directed his domestic policy council of advisers to 
develop a presidential adoption initiative after considering 
various ways the government can encourage and facilitate adoption 
in his directive the president said it is time for the 
leaders of the federal workforce to ensure that our government is 
proadoption adoption works for children who need homes for 
people hoping to become parents and for women facing a crisis 
pregnancy 
bush said that 40 percent of pregnancy counseling in this 
country does not mention adoption as an option 
he called on the agency heads to use agency resources 
suggesting the federal employee assistance programs to help 
adoptive parents and said the departments should begin planning to 
celebrate national adoption week focusing on local children who 
need adoptive homes 
the president said supervisors should be as flexible as 
possible regarding the adoption related leave needs of employees 
including giving hourly leaves to meet with adoption agencies as 
well as longer leaves to care for the adopted children

the house ways and means committee voted 
tuesday to cut by half the surtax on older americans that pays for 
medicare insurance against costs of a catastrophic illness 
shifting some of the cost to both those with lower and those with 
higher incomes 
the panel responding to a flood of mail from the mainly 
higherincome retirees who bear most of the cost of the new 
program also agreed 1917 to raise the flat premium that all but 
the poorest people 65 and older must pay for the coverage 
in general couples with income under 25000 a year would pay 
more for coverage most of those with incomes above that level 
would pay less those above the 80000 level would pay more 
compared with current law 
also included in the committees amendment was a provision that 
allows retirees a onceinalifetime chance to turn down 
catastrophic coverage but to quit that program they also would 
have to give up part b medicare which pays physicians fees 
the committee working on a catchall tax bill by voice vote 
reversed an earlier action that would have repealed what remains of 
the consumer interest deduction that action means about 24 million 
couples and individuals will still be able to write off 10 percent 
of the interest they pay on automobile credit card education and 
other loans next year 
under the 1986 tax overhaul the interest writeoff is being 
phased out this year 20 percent may be deducted after 1990 no 
deduction will be allowed 
still awaiting action by the committee is a big political issue 
whether to reduce the tax on capital gains president bush wants to 
cut the tax rate but democratic leaders are opposed because they 
believe most of the benefit would go to those with incomes over 
100000 a year 
there was no indication when the committee would decide that 
question 
making the decision on how to change the catastrophic program 
seemed to be almost as tough the program became law only a year 
ago but since that time many retirees have complained because 
coverage is required of all medicare beneficiaries and because 
higherincome retirees are having to foot the bill for those with 
lower incomes 
rep sander levin dmich who said his main concern had been 
about middleincome retirees called the committees compromise a 
major gain 
rep brian donnelly dmass who had complained because of the 
flat monthly premium that lowerincome retirees have to pay for 
coverage said he and others will still attempt to have the entire 
program repealed as for allowing retirees to opt out of coverage 
he said even after the committees action its about as 
voluntary as a prison sentence 
under present law most retirees pay a flat premium of 4 a 
month for catastrophic coverage which covers about onethird of 
the cost of the program the remainder is paid by those 65 and 
older whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least 150 a 
year in federal income tax 
that remainder pays a 15 percent surtax on top of federal income 
tax the surtax rate is due to climb to 28 percent by 1993 
the maximum surtax this year is 800 per person or 1600 if 
both spouses are eligible for medicare 
under the committees action the 1989 surtax rate would drop to 
75 percent of taxes over 150 by 1993 the rate would rise to 14 
percent 
the flat premium for catastrophic coverage now 4 a month is 
scheduled under current law to rise to 490 next year with 
similar increases projected in future years the committee plan 
would increase the 1990 premium by 350 4 in 1991 and 410 each 
in 1992 and 1993 
the monthly catastrophic premiums are added to the regular 
charges that most retirees pay for medicare part b coverage which 
help pay physicians fees the regular part b premium is 2790 
this year and scheduled to rise to 3340 by 1993 
to meet requirements for reducing the federal deficit the 
committee voted to delay medicare reimbursements to doctors and 
hospitals by five days at the end of 1990 six days in 1991 three 
days in 1992 and one day in 1993 that would produce a budget 
saving of 2 billion next year

sen slade gorton rwash surprised an 
impeachment hearing panel tuesday when he said wiretap charges 
against judge alcee hastings were too weak to warrant removing him 
from the bench 
hastings denied wrongdoing at his senate impeachment hearing 
emphasizing none whatsoever when asked by sen patrick leahy 
dvt if attorney william borders had ever offered him money to 
fix a case 
hastings 52 miami is accused of plotting with washington 
lawyer borders in 1981 to obtain a 150000 payoff to place two 
convicted racketeers on probation instead of imprisoning them he 
also is charged with perjury and improper disclosure of wiretap 
information to dade county mayor steve clark 
in a surprising development gorton one of 12 senators on a 
panel hearing evidence in the case said that even if the wiretap 
evidence proved to be very damaging it would not amount to enough 
to remove hastings from the us district court bench 
in a statement gorton said his conclusion did not apply to the 
other articles of impeachment against hastings approved by the 
house a year ago and now are being weighed by the senate he did 
not elaborate when asked later 
sen gorton as he said was speaking for himself said sen 
arlen specter rpa noting he would withhold a decision until all 
the evidence was presented 
most of hastings testimony on tuesday involved the wiretap 
count and hastings is expected to testify again on the bribery 
charges 
leahy however arrived late and asked flatly if money to fix a 
case ever had been offered by borders who was convicted of bribery 
conspiracy in 1983 and now is refusing to answer questions before 
the panel he is expected to be called again thursday 
leahy stopped asking questions about bribery after being told 
hastings would testify again later but the judge firmly offered 
his denial the articles of impeachment also accuse hastings of 
lying to a jury at a 1983 trial at which he was acquitted 
in emotional testimony hastings told the senators that he had 
not disclosed the wiretap information 
i did not tell mayor clark anything about anything anytime on 
earth hastings said i take great stock in my ability to 
keep a secret 
hastings told the panel that when he was confronted by two miami 
reporters concerning rumors that he had disclosed the information 
i was absolutely livid in the way this information was coming to 
me 
it was rife in the courthouse and it was bouncing all over the 
place hastings said in a calm voice it is hard for me to 
control my rage as i speak now 
he acknowledged under questioning from lawmakers that he had not 
initially cooperated with the public integrity section of the 
justice department in its investigation of the wiretap leak 
he said he already had been in conflict with the public 
integrity section in the bribery conspiracy case and that he felt 
they had been unfair to him in the past and were likely to do so 
again

the house appropriations committee on tuesday 
refused to finance a planned survey of the intimate details of the 
sex lives of americans aimed at helping scientists better 
understandhow aids spreads 
the panel slashed 11 million from president bushs proposed 
budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 money that would have 
paid for the survey 
the project does not appear to be an appropriate use of public 
funding the committee said 
in a report accompanying the 1552 billion appropriations bill 
for the health and human services labor and education departments 
and for other agencies the committee said if such a survey is 
necessary it should be supported with nongovernmental funds 
the public health service is not to proceed with this study 
the committee report said 
the bill is headed for the house floor and then to the senate 
the proposal to cancel the survey came from the subcommittee on 
labor health and human services and education which approved the 
cancellation in a closed session subcommittee staffers refused to 
say who proposed it 
plans for the survey have been stalled at the department of 
health and human services which includes the public health 
service since the office of management and budget raised concerns 
in april about a pilot questionnaire designed to preceed the larger 
survey of 20000 americans 
in response hhs secretary louis sullivan directed public health 
officials to review the appropriateness of the questions proposed 
for the pilot survey department officials say that since then the 
survey has been through several levels of review and is now 
awaiting consideration of james mason the assistant secretary for 
health 
the pilot survey that had been submitted to omb proposed to ask 
participants when they last had sex what they did and whether 
their partner was a man or women it also asked questions about 
oral and anal sex and masturbation 
backers said the survey was designed to develop a comprehensive 
picture of americans sexual practices to help public health 
officials better understand the spread of aids 
conservatives have lobbied strongly against the survey saying 
scientists already know that aids is spread through sexual contact 
and that the government has no business invading the sexual privacy 
of americans 
james brown a spokesman for the public health service declined 
to comment on the house action except to say we are reviewing the 
situation 
rep henry waxman dcalif said he was very disappointed 
that this survey may not be done 
he noted that a recent general accounting office report said 
information from the survey was essential for projecting the number 
of future aids cases and for planning health and hospital care for 
the growing number of victims of the disease the national academy 
of sciences also said such a survey was necessary for planning aids 
education efforts

sen edward kennedy after touring 
capitalarea aids clinics on tuesday outlined a comprehensive plan 
he said would assure medical care support services and protection 
from discrimination for aids patients 
the massachusetts democrat met with aids victims and visited 
aids and drug treatment clinics tuesday morning later he said the 
cost of his plan about 500 million in fiscal 1990 should be 
viewed as an investment 
it is justifiable in terms of resources and essential in terms 
of public health said kennedy chairman of the senate labor and 
human resources committee and a strong advocate for aids patients 
kennedy noted that the number of americans diagnosed with aids 
recently surpassed 100000 and nearly 60000 have died from the 
disease 
those who persist in thinking that this epidemic does not 
concern them must take note of these figures he said at a news 
conference 
kennedy said his tour of treatment facilities convinced him of 
the need for a strategy to combat the twin epidemics of aids and 
drugs which plague our inner cities he said that will seek 
dramatic expansion of outpatient care facilities intravenous drug 
users and their sexual partners are the fastest growing group of 
aids victims 
belinda mason a 30yearold activist with aids who was named 
last week by president bush to serve on the national aids 
commission told reporters kennedys plan is excellent news for 
all of us 
she said she has known discrimination all too well since 
contracting aids from a blood transfusion during childbirth 
shortly after she was diagnosed in 1987 she recalls hearing that 
the pool in her community of hartford ky was closed ostensibly 
for a filtering problem soon however she learned that it was 
the presence of my body in the water that led to it being closed 
kennedys plan she said would help make life for aids victims 
more humane and equitable 
people with hiv the virus that causes aids and aids only 
want what everyone else wants we want a job and home and the 
right to a decent life she said 
kennedy said stronger antidiscrimination protection for aids 
victims is the most important piece of his plan such protection 
was dropped from an aids bill in the last congress in order to stem 
controversy and win passage of the measure 
kennedys committee currently is considering legislation to 
strengthen safeguards for aids victims against discrimination in 
employment public services housing transportation and 
communications the measure is expected to come up next week 
kennedy says he also will push to extend for three years a 
program that helps lowincome aids victims pay for lifeprolonging 
treatments the program which expires sept 30 won approval from 
kennedys committee last week 
other parts of the kennedy plan would 
ensure that promising new aids treatments are made available as 
quickly as possible and that 6 million for communitybased drug 
testing be doubled next fiscal year 
provide comprehensive medical care and support services for 
aids patients and housing for the growing number of homeless people 
with aids 
permit aids victims to keep their private health insurance 
after they become disabled 
provide aidsprevention information to drug users 
help communities hit hardest by aids give financial assistance 
to hospitals and other facilities overburdened by the crisis 
kennedys 500 million plan would be in addition to bushs 
proposed 16 billion for aids research and education in fiscal 
1990

us national guard pilots went on 
standby tuesday to help fight hundreds of fires that burned 
millions of acres of forests and brushwoods in manitoba 
saskatchewan and ontario 
clouds of dense smoke hampered waterbombers and rescue efforts 
thundershowers rumbled across the fire belt tuesday sprinkling 
light rain on the burning hinterland but failing to help control 
fires that have forced the evacuation of 20500 people and 
blackened about 37 million acres many fires raged out of control 
firefighters succeeded in holding fire lines around threatened 
communities and officials said only a few houses and lodges have 
burned there have been no reports of injuries or deaths 
manitoba natural resources minister harry enns said national 
guard pilots stationed in north dakota were put on standby and 
could arrive in manitoba at any time they are needed 
when the situation becomes such that we cant send up an 
aircraft because we havent got a pilot then we have these crews 
on standby he said 
they would relieve waterbomber crews and pilots frustrated by 
smoke so thick it turned the sun into a reddish smudge 
officials said tuesday night that planes trains and trucks had 
virtually completed the evacuation of people from firestricken 
areas of manitoba 
but in ontario 40 people were airlifted out of kasabonika most 
of the evacuees were frome manitoba but at least 350 people were 
removed from firethreatened areas in ontario and 900 were 
evacuated in saskaels 
and given vouchers to shop for clothes many had fled so hurriedly 
the only belongings they had were the clothes they were wearing 
winnipeg relief workers organized activities and excursions for 
the refugees 
officials said seven women from minnesota on a 600mile canoe 
trip did not realize the danger they faced until they paddled into 
cross lake where surprised firefighters watched as they approached 
the women were flown to thompson tuesday and said they were 
anxious to continue their wilderness trip the officials had no 
further information about the women 
the pall has made breathing difficult in the vast northern zone 
waterbombers could not see the fires blazing in brush and 
timberland 
its like dusk in the middle of the afternoon northern 
affairs minister jim downey said after returning from the sparsely 
populated region on monday downey had flown with manitoba premier 
gary filmon to thompson the pas and flin flon where evacuees are 
being taken 
filmon said he is considering sending medical staff from 
southern manitoba to relieve doctors and nurses taxed by patients 
being treated for smoke inhalation at thompson a mining city of 
about 15000 it has taken in more than 3000 evacuees 
hot dry winds blew flames perilously close to settlements and 
mining towns 
its sometimes an hourtohour situation waiting for the 
smoke to lift to a point where a plane can land said provincial 
government spokeswoman diana soroka 
thompson was many miles from the nearest fire monday but smoke 
shut down its airport temporarily 
the fire zone begins 250 miles north of winnipeg and stretches 
220 miles from northeastern saskatchewan to northwestern ontario 
officials estimated 224 fires were burning in manitoba and 165 
in saskatchewan on monday but said smoke obscured some blazes the 
fires became a serious problem last week and evacuations began 
thursday 
soroka said some evacuees were being taken by plane train and 
car to brandon and winnipeg in the south were taking them 
wherever the room is military transport planes helicopters 
hoses pumps tents and other materials have been pouring in from 
other parts of canada and the united states 
about 1600 firefighters 53 helicopters 11 waterbombers nine 
fixedwing aircraft and several pieces of heavy equipment such as 
bulldozers have been thrown into the effort 
its estimated 25 million will be spent by the end of the week 
compared with 15 million for the whole season last year

a chainsmoking politician fumed when a 
smoking ban was announced for his flight just before takeoff but 
the airline got burned in a court judgment 
pasco mayor ed hendler sued delta air lines for its lastminute 
elimination of a smoking section on a flight he took in march on 
monday a judge agreed that delta owed him a refund of his 389 
airfare plus 10 in filing and court costs 
i was not provided the services i paid for hendler said in 
a small claims court complaint im very pleased im tired of 
being a secondclass citizen because i smoke 
franklin county district judge hw pete felsted ruled that 
hendler was owed the price of his ticket because delta did not give 
him specific notice of the possibility of the change 
delta has 14 days to appeal jim lundy a company spokesman in 
atlanta said tuesday the airline is reviewing the case 
he said federal law requires that every nonsmoking passenger is 
guaranteed a seat and a planes smoking section can shrink 
depending on the demand for nonsmoking seats 
in the case of this flight it appears a nosmoking passenger 
showed up very near departure it became apparent that the entire 
flight would be designated a nosmoking flight lundy said 
hendler was flying to washington dc as a representative to 
the american public transportation association meeting 
i was a nervous wreck by the time i got there he said 
calling himself a smoking addict

the democraticcontrolled house voted tuesday 
to slash nearly 2 billion from president bushs request for star 
wars but the senate overwhelmingly kept the administrations b2 
bomber plan relatively intact except for a token cut 
by a vote of 981 the senate endorsed the costly stealth bomber 
if it meets flight testing standards and demonstrates that it can 
perform its mission of evading radar detection and penetrate soviet 
air space 
bush administration officials have expressed hope that the 
senate vote on the bomber in the presidents 295 billion defense 
budget would serve as a counterbalance to expected votes in the 
house cutting the program 
the house takes up the issue wednesday when it considers 
amendments to eliminate or severly limit the program 
in crafting its defense blueprint the house cut 18 billion 
from the 49 billion bush had proposed for star wars formally 
known as the strategic defense initiative lawmakers approved an 
amendment to cut 700 million from the program in addition to the 
11 billion the house armed services committee had trimmed from 
the program 
the vote was 248175 with 214 democrats and 34 republicans 
voting for the reduction 
we serve notice on the administration to bring this futuristic 
program down into the world of budget reality rep john m 
spratt jr dsc declared just before the house reduced funds 
for the antimissile shield 
after reducing sdi spending the house overwhelmingly approved 
using 150 million of the star wars money for such items as 
helicopters artillery rockets and army ammunition and 300 
million for cleanup of nuclear defense facilities 
members also approved spending 450 million in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 the 1990 year and 600 million in fiscal 1991 
for military drug interdiction 
defense secretary dick cheney on capitol hill for a meeting 
with senate republicans said the house decision on star wars 
seriously undermines the program 
im confident the senate will do better im confident we will 
come out of the senate with our program basically intact including 
the strategic defense initiative and the b2 bomber said cheney 
a former congressman from wyoming 
cheneys prediction for the senate was largely on target as 
lawmakers approved a modest cut of 300 million in the 47 billion 
requested by bush for the b2 in the new fiscal year 
the senate restrictions sponsored by sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee and sen john 
warner of virginia the panels ranking gop member was intended to 
insure that the b2 perform as advertised before a decision is made 
to build a full fleet of 132 planes 
echoing administration officials nunn said what we want to 
do is put great fear in them the soviets great pause as to 
what we would do and what we are capable of doing after they have 
launched a first strike 
sen james sasser dtenn voted against the amendment sen 
spark matsunaga dhawaii is hospitalized and did not vote 
the senate also voted 990 to increase by 19 billion in the 
new fiscal year and by 21 billion in the following year the 
funds available to provide modern combat gear and weapons for the 
troops of the national guard and military reserve forces 
in a 981 roll call the senate also approved a nunnwarner 
amendment aimed at improving the effectiveness of small infantry 
units through the development of improved weapons and equipment 
sen mark hatfield rore voted no 
cheneys concerns about the house held true as member rejected 
an amendment to accept the defense secretarys procurement budget 
the vote largely along party lines was 278143 
prior to the final star wars vote the house rejected an even 
deeper cut in the antimissile shield as well as an amendment that 
would have restored all but 300 million to the administrations 
request 
the ranking republican on the house armed services committee 
rep william dickinson of alabama agreed that conventional forces 
need more money but the problem is were taking it from the 
wrong source 
there comes a point when you keep dipping out of this 
particular program youre going to kill it he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked if bush would veto 
any bill that cuts money for star wars told reporters were a 
long way from considering vetoes were talking now about 
winning not about vetoes 
republican rep john rowland of connecticut attributed the 
administrations defeat on star wars to the emphasis it has placed 
on lobbying for the b2 stealth bomber 
they focused hard on this issue rowland said referring to 
the bomber they got creamed on sdi 
lawmakers have expressed sticker shock at the b2 programs 
cost estimates 23 billion already invested eventually a total 
of 70 billion for 132 planes or 530 million per copy 
the house armed services committee voted for deep cuts in the 
program slashing 800 million from the bush request and is to 
consider measures to terminate the program or place strict limits 
on further spending 
by voice vote tuesday the senate approved an amendment 
requiring the pentagon to report to congress by december on 
alternatives to a 132bomber force sen edward m kennedy 
dmass in introducing the measure said 132 is not magic we 
must examine a smaller force 
the bush administration meanwhile reiterated its argument that 
elimination of the b2 would force the united states to revise its 
position in strategic arms reduction talks with the soviet union 
national security adviser brent scowcroft in a letter to 
warner said it is important that we do not send the wrong 
signal to the soviets regarding us resolve to maintain a strong 
viable triad of air land and sea forces

a top cuban official on tuesday rejected 
us suggestions that cuba has been lax in combating drug smuggling 
to the united states and said cuba itself has been a favorite 
target of us traffickers 
vice minister of foreign affairs ricardo alarcon also renewed 
his governments appeal for uscuban cooperation in fighting drug 
smuggling 
speaking at a lengthy news conference he bitterly criticized 
us policies and cited allegations that high us officials have 
trafficked in drugs without prosecution 
in washington meanwhile a senior state department official 
made similar charges about cuba at a capitol hill hearing 
melvyn levitsky assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters said there was a sharp increase in drug 
shipments through cuban territory in the first six months of this 
year despite a sudden crackdown that led to the executions of four 
cuban officials 
some evidence suggests that cuba simultaneously facilitates 
the flow of drugs in selected cases while prosecuting other cases 
to conviction levitsky added during an appearance before the 
house foreign affairs committee narcotics task force 
alarcon alleged there was a dramatic contrast between the 
american attitude toward us officials suspected of drug 
involvement and the decisive action cuba took against a drug 
trafficking ring led by one of the revolutions most trusted 
figures gen arnaldo ochoa 
ochoa and three of his allies were executed on july 13 a number 
of other officials received lesser sentences 
levitsky dismissed the cuban proceedings as carefully 
choreographed show trials and said cuban president fidel castro 
most likely was aware of highlevel involvement in narcotics 
trafficking 
at a later news conference in cuba jorge gomez barata a top 
official of the department of revolucionary orientation was asked 
about a us plan to sponsor a television version of radio marti a 
special voice of america broadcast service to cuba 
the tv marti plan is close to final congressional aproval and is 
expected to go on the air if it passes certain technical tests set 
for this fall 
gomez barata said aproval of the plan is illegal under 
international telecommunications law and could lead to a crisis 
in relations between the united states and cuba 
he said cuba could jam tv marti and jammers were ready to 
start operating at any moment cuba is not a country willing to 
allow its sovereignty to be trampled on 
alarcon said hundreds of drug traffickers and dozens of aircraft 
and small vessels have been captured by cuban authorities over the 
years he added that tons and tons of packages of marijuana 
have washed up onto cuban shores 
although cuba could not prove the packages originated in the 
united states he cited statistics showing that us marijuana 
production ranked second only to corn among agricultural products 
alarcon said the united states and cuba must establish ties of 
cooperation in combating narcotics smuggling as part of a more 
rational attitude for dealing with the problem 
castro originally suggested joint cooperation in combating 
trafficking but the state department reacted coolly to the 
proposal 
levitsky said cuba has for years shown indifference to the drug 
trade has not responded when us officials have sought to alert 
havana to specific shipments and has ignored us indictments of 
its officials 
but he said that we are taking a fresh look at areas in which 
the government of cuba could tangibly demonstrate the seriousness 
of its claimed willingness to cooperate 
alarcon said the united states has never provided cuba with any 
specific evidence regarding use of cuban air space or territorial 
waters for drug smuggling he said the cuban revolution will not 
tolerate the least flexibility or make the slightest concession 
toward this vice or persons related to this vice 
alarcon spoke for almost three hours to a group of journalists 
mostly foreign assembled here for the 36th anniversary of 
castros debut as a guerrilla fighter 
castro will mark the occasion with a speech here wednesday night

a tentative agreement was reached tuesday on 
conditions governing the exxon valdezs entry into san diego bay 
but neither exxon nor the coast guard guaranteed a leakfree 
passage by the damaged oil tanker 
ive learned if nothing else from this experience not to be 
too categorical said tom gillette exxon shipping cos external 
affairs adviser 
but i think that everything that can reasonably be done both 
from the state standpoint and exxons standpoint is being done 
gillette said in a hearing of the assemblys select committee on 
oil spill prevention and response preparedness 
the committee chaired by assemblyman ted lempert was formed in 
the aftermath of the nations worst oil spill caused by the valdez 
on march 24 when the ship struck a reef in alaskas prince william 
sound 
in another development tuesday exxon corp trying to rebuff 
criticism suggesting it might not resume its cleanup in alaska next 
year insisted it would return but stopped short of making a 
commitment 
a july 19 internal memo to exxon oil spill managers which was 
quoted in media reports monday suggested the oil companys cleanup 
crews would leave alaska for good after shutting down for the 
winter 
in valdez alaska otto harrison general manager for exxon 
valdez operations in alaska said at a hastily called news 
conference tuesday the memo was not intended to extend to any 
other phase of our cleanup operations in the future 
the memo said that the company would shut down cleanup 
operations for the winter for safety and operational reasons 
but it went on to say all equipment will be fully demobilized 
and that our only commitment for the spring of 1990 is to survey 
the shorelines 
in california the oil spill committee was charged with 
evaluating the states ability to respond to a major oil spill and 
recommending ways to improve the system 
the committee focused on the saga of the exxon valdez which 
remained about four miles off san clemente island and 56 miles from 
san diego 
the coast guard denied the ship entry to san diego bay for 
repairs on july 10 because of oil leakage and other discharges 
navigational problems also were created by steel slabs that peeled 
away from the hull during the 2500mile journey from alaska 
samples from two slicks that coincided with the valdezs arrival 
showed traces of alaskan north slope crude mixed with heavy 
concentrations of marine life in the ships shredded cargo tanks 
but coast guard cmdr don montoro said other preliminary test 
results showed no toxicity and barely detectable hydrocarbon levels 
in samples of hardened oil residue and seawater from the ships 
cargo tanks 
as far as the coast guard is concerned as long as everything 
else has been put in place i see no reason why the vessel cant 
come into port said montoro 
as captain of the port montoro has the ultimate say on when the 
valdez can enter san diego bay en route to national steel and 
shipbuilding co for a 25 million repair the move likely would 
take place between friday and sunday he said 
still montoro said it would be unrealistic to expect the valdez 
to enter the harbor leakfree 
the bottom is completely open in 10 of the 15 tanks he 
said but were very satisfied that whatever small amount of 
debris does come out its not going to adversely affect the 
environment 
divers late monday completed underwater cutting of the seven 
jagged steel pieces dangling from the hull more than 100 tons of 
steel were removed and allowed to fall 3000 feet to the ocean 
bottom the ship could not clear san diego harbor shallows with the 
plates dangling

the united airlines crew who flew a 
dc10 jumbo jet with no hydraulic controls went by the book until 
they ran out of standard procedures and then improvised the 
planes pilot said tuesday 
we realized we had more than just an engine failure it was 
apparent to all of us we had lost all of our hydraulic fluid 
pilot al c haynes said at a news conference in sioux city where 
flight 232 crashed a week ago it was his first public comment on 
the crash 
when he asked flight engineer dudley dvorak for the procedure 
for that he said there isnt one so we made it up as we went 
along haynes said 
haynes dvorak copilot william r records and offduty united 
pilot denny fitch brought the plane down at sioux gateway airport 
where it crashed flipped broke apart and burst into flames of 
the 296 passengers and crew 185 survived and 111 were killed 
haynes said the crew never contemplated not making it to the 
airport 
we were just going to go in and land and thats what we tried 
to do how could we operate if we didnt believe that he said 
he would not discuss the cause or technical details of the crash 
because the national transportation safety board is still 
investigating 
the pilot said he cant wait to get back to work but added 
we must not forget that 111 people perished in this accident 
this crew is dedicated to finding the cause of this accident so 
we can maybe never have it happen again 
later he and his wife darlene returned home to seattle to 
applause and hugs from their older son anthony haynes 29 and his 
wife marlene in front of their small yellow house a few blocks 
east of seattletacoma international airport 
its just great to be home the 57yearold pilot told a 
crowd of reporters gathered outside his house if you can give me 
a few days maybe we can all get together and talk about this 
rob doughty of united said however it might be a month or more 
before the crew would give any interviews 
capt haynes is very adamant that the crew tell their story as 
a team because it was a team effort doughty said 
dvorak 51 who lives in tacoma wash also flew home tuesday 
in iowa investigators once again searched corn and soybean 
fields about 60 miles from the airport for important pieces of the 
dc10s no 2 engine the tailmounted engine that apparently blew 
apart and severed lines of all three hydraulic systems 
those hydraulic systems allow pilots to set key wing and tail 
panels that control the aircrafts attitude and direction without 
them the pilot has little control over the airplane other than his 
throttles 
meanwhile in washington transportation secretary samuel 
skinner said tuesday that nothing about the crash indicates that 
other dc10s are unsafe or that anything more now needs to be done 
to make them safer he defended new federal aviation administration 
head james busey who declared the dc10 a safe aircraft even 
though the cause of the crash has not been determined 
on wednesday ntsb inspector jack young planned to visit a 
general electric co jet engine plant in the cincinnati suburb of 
evendale to examine the manufacturing records for engine that blew 
apart the plant made all three of the dc10s engines 
haynes appeared weak and tearyeyed as the news conference began 
but grew more composed as he recounted the ordeal he had cuts on 
his face and a blackened left eye 
dvorak appeared at the news conference with haynes but did not 
answer questions records and fitch are still in the hospital 
haynes said records was flying the plane when they heard a loud 
report and knew an engine had blown haynes started the procedure 
for shutting down the engine 
everybody kicked in everybody offered their own assistance 
without being told we have a lot of experience here and it showed 
in the cockpit theres no substitute for experience haynes said 
the crew was on the radio first to air traffic controllers in 
minneapolis and then in sioux city as they battled to land the 
plane 
theres nothing like a calm soothing voice talking to you 
telling you everything you need to know haynes said 
officials said many aboard the plane survived because the jet 
came down at the airport where rescue workers already had been 
assembled haynes and his crew were credited with getting it there 
but haynes said there is no hero there is just a group of four 
people who did their job 
investigators said airplanes with the infrared cameras were 
concentrating their search for metal pieces from the dc10s jet 
engine in the expanse of farmers fields 
the parts that we have not recovered are the parts we are very 
interested in said robert macintosh chief ntsb investigator 
finding the missing pieces was proving difficult in part because 
much of the search area is covered with thick crops the corn 
fields are about 4 feet tall and the soy crops are in bloom 
macintosh said officials were painstakingly reassembling that 
tail section in a hangar at the airport to determine where pieces 
flew 
were interested in the trajectory of some of the pieces he 
said we feel there were rotating parts that went and penetrated 
part of the airframe

four policemen and eight guerrillas from two 
different rebel groups were killed in separate clashes in lima and 
the southern highlands police said tuesday 
in the first incident 300 shining path rebels late monday 
attacked a police post in rural acobamba with dynamite and 
automatic weapons fire police said 
four of the 30 officers at the post and three rebels were 
killed police said the survivors abandoned the post after an 
hourlong battle 
the rebels then blew up the station and the city hall and 
ransacked stores in the town located 175 miles southeast of lima 
the attackers made off with arms medicine food and clothing 
police said 
troops were dispatched to acobamba to pursue the guerrillas 
police said 
in a second clash at least 15 guerrillas from the tupac amaru 
revolutionary movement tuesday attacked a lima police post with 
grenades dynamite and rifle fire five rebels were killed in a gun 
battle and the others fled police reported 
they said there were no casualties among the 15 officers inside 
the station located in the pueblo libre workingclass section of 
lima 
tupac amaru rebels advocate cubanstyle marxism

tupac amaru flags near the station 
the guerrillas also set off bombs in three nearby banks and a 
telephone office damaging the buildings and breaking windows 
according to police 
the movement has been fighting perus elected governments since 
1984 it takes its name from an 18th century hero who led a peasant 
revolt against spanish rule in the peruvian highlands 
estimates of the number of activists in the organization range 
from 500 to 1500 on april 28 62 tupac amaru guerrillas were 
killed when they were surprised by a military patrol near the 
highland town of jauja 
the movement is smaller and considered less violent than the 
shining path a maoist guerrilla group that took up arms against 
the government in 1980 
the shining path began its guerrilla war in the city of 
ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima but has since spread its 
influence through much of the andean highlands and into the 
cocaproducing jungle regions of the northeast 
the government says more than 15000 people many of them 
peasants caught in crossfire between guerrillas and troops have 
been killed in violence related to the insurgencies

taiwanese enforcement officers on tuesday 
headed for a rendezvous with a driftnet vessel that has been 
shadowed by a us coast guard cutter in the north pacific since it 
was implicated in a scheme to sell 13 million worth of illegally 
caught salmon a week ago 
the ship carrying tawianese police officers was expected to 
reach the sung ching no 1 and the coast guard cutter morgenthau 
within several days said ed wolfe the state departments 
ambassador for fisheries and oceans 
after a joint boarding party inspects the sung ching no 1 it 
will be turned over to taiwanese custody wolfe said the united 
states expects the crew to eventually be prosecuted under taiwanese 
law 
taiwans domestic law restricts the export of salmon and also 
limits where taiwanese driftnet vessels are allowed to fish 
however wolfe said the government of taiwan had provided no 
guarantees it would prosecute 
weve requested that they do so and it would be in their best 
interest he said 
taiwan had previously refused to allow us personnel to board 
the ship 
the sung ching no 1 was one of two taiwanese driftnet vessels 
implicated in the illegal sale of salmon to us undercover agents 
posing as fish buyers in a sixmonth sting operation 
last week federal agents arrested two taiwanese men as they 
emerged from a seattle bank vault carrying more than 1 million in 
cash allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally 
caught fish 
at the time the arrests were made the sung ching no 1 and the 
other taiwanese ship were preparing to transfer the fish to the 
us government chartered fishing tender redfin in the north 
pacific north of midway island 
when the captains of the two taiwanese ships boarded the redfin 
to arrange details of the transfer they were detained but their 
vessels fled as the mogenthau approached 
taiwan has until aug 29 to sign an agreement with the united 
states regulating the conduct of driftnet vessels the agreement 
would permit us inspectors to board taiwanes vessels and would 
require the vessels to carry satellite transponders to signal their 
locations

a paraplegic sorely inched 
closer to the top of blustery el capitan on tuesday trying to make 
up for lost time to reach his goal of conquering the granite wall 
mark wellman and his climbing partner mike corbett got a late 
start on the eighth day of their tortuous trek to the top of the 
3200foot monolith although they had planned to begin climbing 
the final 700 feet as early as 7 am instead they decided they 
needed extra rest 
were both really sore and were both ready to get off the 
mountain wellman whose legs are paralyzed said in a radio 
conversation with a park ranger 
wellman hopes to reach the top around noon wednesday making him 
the first paraplegic to make the climb pulling himself up 6 inches 
at a time on ropes placed by corbett 
wellman was paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feet 
during a climb of the 13700foot gables peak south of yosemite 
in 1982 he trained daily for six months for el capitan making 35 
practice climbs on other sheer rocks and weight training 
corbett has a record 41 ascents of el capitan 
corbetts brother tony corbett of houston said he had not seen 
his brother in eight years before he watched a recent news report 
about the attempt to scale el capitan 
you can just imagine how i felt when i saw him its hard to 
say elation i guess you could say corbett said in a telephone 
interview 
wellman said his powerful hands are swollen but he is not 
injured he anticipated it would take 7000 pullups to reach the 
summit 
their biggest problem has been wind which wellman said has been 
gusting each day sometimes blowing them 10 feet out from the cliff 
face

there should be no question about the lady in 
question 
charles buschs latest sendup of american popular culture 
specifically those patriotic sentimental war movies of the 1940s 
is his best work yet not only as a playwright but as a performer 
the production which opened tuesday at offbroadways orpheum 
theater is a giddy genderbender comedy that spoofs those 
selfsacrificing heroines squarejawed heroes and sadistic nazis 
who were staples of the silver screen nearly 50 years ago 
busch plays gertrude garnet a touring american concert pianist 
who finds herself in the bavarian mansion of the nefarious baron 
wilhelm von elsner among the other occupants are the barons 
cigarsmoking momma a handsome american professor a pigtailed 
little girl who looks and acts like a teutonic version of patty 
mccormack in the bad seed and gertrudes wisecracking female 
sidekick kitty 
the convoluted plot involves the rescue of the professors 
mother a famous actress from the clutches of the baron and its 
gertrude who must do most of the work she and busch are up to 
the task 
from his hugely successful and still running vampire 
lesbians of sodom to pyscho beach party to the lady in 
question busch always has played the leading female role in his 
plays why not they are tailored to his talent 
the actor sporting long red tresses and a different glamorous 
outfit for every scene resembles joan crawford with bits of norma 
shearer greer garson barbara stanwyck bette davis and even greta 
garbo thrown in for effect 
but his acting is more than skindeep busch seems more assured 
and less campy in his creation of this real hollywood heroine the 
writing is also firstrate there is a consistency of style and 
tone a neverwavering affection for the material busch is a 
romantic and that love of the movies shows throughout the play 
he also has been generous in writing good roles for other 
members of what has become a resident troupe of players there are 
strong contributions from such regular members as andy halliday as 
the evil oversexed child arnie kolodner as gertrudes true love 
meghan robinson as a gorgon of a mother and julie halston as 
gertrudes best buddy 
director kenneth elliott who also plays the baron has just as 
light a touch as busch with the material and there are fine 
production values particularly a throbbing musical soundtrack and 
a set of outlandish wigs for busch designed by elizabeth katherine 
carr the lady in question definitely rates a date

the house ethics committee said tuesday it 
plans to hire the chicago law firm that conducted the jim wright 
investigation to review a complaint against republican whip newt 
gingrich 
the announcement was the latest indication that the panel is 
close to approving a formal investigation of the georgia 
republican who arranged a controversial investment partnership to 
promote a book he coauthored 
rep bill alexander dark accused gingrich in a complaint 
last april of violating campaign finance laws house limits on 
outside income and a house rule preventing acceptance of gifts from 
those with a direct interest in legislation 
gingrich the secondranking house gop leader said last week 
that richard j phelan the chief attorney in the wright 
investigation strikes me as an honorable man the committee has 
to look at what the standard is for hiring an outside counsel and 
do what it thinks is right 
he called alexanders charges baseless and said any 
serious review of the allegations would indicate how politically 
motivated they were 
gingrich filed the complaint that helped launch the 
investigation of thenspeaker wright dtexas wright quit as 
speaker and resigned from the house after the committee charged him 
with 69 rules violations 
in a statement tuesday gingrich reviewed his votes and 
statements in the wright case and other congressional ethics cases 
of his 1 years in the house and said in light of those positions 
i have always know that any complaint filed against me would 
receive intense scrutiny even if unfounded i will cooperate fully 
with the committee to expedite this matter 
the ethics panel said it asked the house administration 
committee to approve a contract with the firm of phelan pope amp 
john ltd phelan was the chief attorney in the investigation of 
wright and several associates assisted him 
phelan has told reporters that his personal time in a new 
investigation would be more limited than in the wright case but 
added the associates could do the work phelan also has dropped 
hints that hes considering running in the illinois democratic 
gubernatorial primary next march 
i would assume mr phelan would be part of the legal team 
even though the contract is with the law firm said ralph lotkin 
chief counsel for the ethics committee 
last thursday the ethics panel held its first meeting since the 
wright investigation but made no immediate decision on launching a 
preliminary inquiry of gingrich the first step in a formal 
investigation 
the ethics panel said tuesday the legal assistance would be 
for the specific purpose of providing the committee with an 
analysis of the complaint and associated materials the committee 
has every expectation that the proposed contract with phelan pope 
amp john ltd will be approved and that as soon as this occurs the 
law firm will immediately begin its review 
gingrich admittedly has been seeking advice from a number of 
allies and reportedly has approached former rep ed bethune an 
arkansas republican with a law practice in washington for help 
alexanders complaint focused on the cos limited 
partnership which consisted of 21 investors who contributed 
5000 each to promote window of opportunity a book written by 
gingrich his wife and a third author gingrich was not an 
investor but his wife was paid for running the partnership formed 
in 1984 
the alexander complaint contends 
the investors money could be construed as income to gingrich 
in violation of limitations on house members outside earnings 
the 105000 raised could constitute a gift to gingrich from 
those with a direct interest in legislation house rules prohibit 
members from keeping gifts of more than 100 from anyone with such 
an interest 
the money could be considered campaign contributions subject 
to reporting obligations and restrictions under campaign financing 
laws if so alexander said the investment money may have exceeded 
contribution limits and may not have been properly reported

ecuadoran authorities held an eastern airlines 
jetliner and detained its crew after discovering cocaine aboard the 
aircraft the company said tuesday 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the crew members were told 
by ecuadoran authorities to remain at their hotel in guayaquil 
until ecuadoran investigators take their depositions the 
investigation was delayed by simon bolivar day festivities he 
added 
eastern flight 51 an a300 left miami on monday on a multileg 
flight to ecuador matell said he said the plane was carefully 
checked in miami but he noted it was on the ground 43 minutes in 
cali colombia before heading to guayaquil 
in guayaquil authorities found six packets of cocaine hidden 
below the floor of a lavatory matell said initial company reports 
on the incident said three passengers were arrested but matell 
said tuesday night he had no information to confirm that 
ecuadoran customs officials found that the six packets each 
contained 22 pounds of cocaine said customs capt nilo montalvo 
it was the sixth shipment of cocaine found aboard an eastern 
jetliner by drug agents in ecuador since december authorities 
there said no eastern crew members have been arrested in the cases 
according to reports from antidrug agents guayaquil has become 
a bridge preferred by colombian drug gangs for sending cocaine 
to united states 
eastern canceled a return flight tuesday and will send a new 
plane and crew to guayaquil on wednesday to resume service the 
multileg flight that also includes panama flies three times weekly 
from miami matell said 
matell said several planes have been temporarily impounded in 
the last two months but he said he didnt think the incidents were 
related to the strike that began march 4 by easterns unions 
this is something weve been battling for a long long time 
matell said no individual company has the resources to shut off 
the flow of drugs from south america 
eastern earlier this month was chastised by perry rivkind miami 
district director of the us immigration and naturalization 
service for several recent cases in which cuban nationals without 
legal documents arrived in this country on easterns latin american 
routes to miami eastern said that too was a traditional problem 
on those routes 
eastern has reportedly been negotiating to sell its latin routes 
to american airlines as part of easterns efforts to emerge from 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization as a smaller moreefficient 
carrier

if jackie mason can translate his ability to 
boil things down to their barest basics he might have a hit show 
on abc this fall 
stars and producers have been sitting in news conferences 
answering questions from the 100plus television critics who are 
meeting here to preview 198990 programming 
one tv critic asked mason whether his chicken soup with its 
heavy emphasis on the ethnicity of its star would play in the 
midwest 
i dont see why i have to answer to you said mason one of 
the many times he cracked up the audience 
in fact mason had flown in from washington to help promote his 
new show mason won a tony for his oneman show on broadway and 
now hes hooked up with marcy carsey and tom werner executive 
producers of the cosby show and roseanne to create a new 
sitcom 
mason plays a character very much like himelf an aging jewish 
bachelor he lives with his mother and is conducting a secret 
affair with a catholic neighbor played by lynn redgrave who has 
several children 
with mason holding court the news conference took on aspects of 
a nightclub performance even redgrave got into the act when she 
was asked what it was like working with mason 
well ive worked with a few comedians in my day and i must 
say that usually ive understood why they mostly work alone she 
said 
mason however is a rarity she added and when i met 
him i realized i was deeply in love with him and were planning 
to run away 
as to the more serious question of whether a mass audience will 
take to a sitcom about a very jewish man who performs monologues on 
his roof and a very catholic woman with an irish brogue mason 
insisted viewers would take to the show 
he noted he has spent a career performing his standup act in 
the midwest as well as elsewhere and he found no communication 
problem 
its all pure nonsense in my opinion because all my life as a 
comedian ive been watching gentiles laughing at my humor and im 
watching jews tell me yech its a little too jewish he said 
although he performs a monologue at the beginning and end of the 
show mason said he found the sitcom format a much more disciplined 
structure than he is used to i have very limited experience in 
the field of any kind of precise comedy he said i only did a 
couple of cockamamie movies that didnt go anyplace 
nevertheless abc is taking a chance that mason will make the 
same kind of splash that two other comedians bill cosby and 
roseanne barr have made in carseywerner productions 
werner said that the two have not seized on a formula here but 
simply saw mason as an appealing performer we felt that jackie 
mason is a comedian who onstage and in his act he tells the 
truth and he pierces hypocrisy and he has observations not just 
about jews and gentiles but about the way the world is that we 
found to be perceptive and funny 
mason said he had been offered a number of television 
opportunities since his broadway show became a big hit he picked 
carsey and werner because he knew they were successful and because 
they had hired two writers whose work he liked on the redd foxx 
show saul turteltaub and bernard orenstein 
so when they told me turtelbaum sic and orenstein i said 
oy these same writers from the foxx show and these guys carsey 
and werner with three big hits they also have a different 
world and now i didnt care if i liked them personally or 
not mason said i didnt care if they were jewish or gentile 
i didnt care if they were american citizens i didnt care if they 
were spies from africa i didnt care of they came down to burn 
down my building i figured these are the people 
someone asked carsey how she and werner are so successful at 
creating sitcoms she noted that she and werner had been in the 
business for years and had failed often enough in the past i was 
trying to explain to jackie on the way down in the elevator he 
asked me why do you guys think that you know what they like out 
there we said well you know for the same reason you know what 
joke is going to work you do it for lots and lots of years 
carsey said basically however success is a result of 
identifying with the audience so if we like what were doing we 
sort of assume that millions of people out there might have the 
same feeling about what were doing 
but if its that simple wondered mason how come it took 
you this long to learn it 
chicken soup will premiere this fall on abc

in some parts of the country sellers of housing 
condominiums and cooperatives are losing patience with a market so 
inert it barely supports hope 
but dont give up says an authority on the subject the condo 
concept remains alive and well and is destined to remain a vital 
and desirable part of americas housing markets 
the problem if there is one in your area probably arises from 
a frenzy of building that left a glut on the market or because 
comparable rental housing is priced competitively 
another factor hurting some markets is that investors who bought 
coops to rent out just a few years ago began dumping them when the 
tax laws were changed in 1986 to limit the deductibility of 
interest and other costs 
the selling problems that exist particularly in the northeast 
probably have little to do with the desirability of condo or coop 
living but a lot to do with temporary cyclical market factors 
paul low president of lomas mortgage usa surveyed the condo 
market for us housing markets an expensive publication 
circulated among real estate and construction people and found 
many reasons for optimism 
first he said there is evidence of increased acceptance each 
generation has more members who have grown up in highdensity 
environments more who have lived in or near largescale 
multifamily housing he says 
such accommodations he says are gaining acceptability both 
socially and psychologically 
affordability plays a big role condo units often are more 
affordable the main reason being the reduced cost of land per 
unit or the fact that more attached than detached units can be 
placed on a similar plot 
often the condo is welllocated too while americans might 
still like to live in the wide open spaces they usually arent 
lucky enough to find such ideals close to their work condos often 
are closer to employment centers 
time seems to be a factor in the condos favor although it 
wasnt always viewed that way conventional wisdom in the 1970s had 
america advancing toward the fourday workweek amid speculation on 
how leisure time would be spent 
it hasnt worked out that way says low instead of lingering 
in gourmet kitchens we sprint to and from the microwave instead 
of lazily tending our rose gardens we hire landscape crews just to 
keep our lawns mowed 
demographics favor condos for doubleincome couples and working 
singles the idea of caring for a sprawling ranch on a large 
suburban lot sounds onerous for them such a house means work 
the same thing they do all day 
but that isnt the only demographic factor low observes that 
the proportion of nevermarried men in the traditional firsttime 
homebuying age group has grown even faster than that of women he 
offers these statistics 
nevermarried men constituted 777 percent of the 2024 age 
group in 1988 up nine percent from 1980 in the 2529 age group 
the percentage was 433 percent up about 10 percent from 1980 and 
in the 3034 age category the share of nevermarried males grew 
nine percent 
that he says translates to more solo homeowners and potential 
homeowners who because of various factors are inclined toward 
buying convenience rather than responsibilities and chores in 
housing 
divorce plays a role single parents male and female are a 
fastgrowing group security is important too social factors also 
singles and newlyweds may like to mingle perhaps at the swimming 
pool that some condos offer 
encouraging also for those enduring the tortures of down markets 
is an item from the national association of realtors showing that 
on a national basis existing condos and coops have been 
appreciating faster than detached units 
that trend in fact has existed since 1986 last year condo 
and coop prices rose 68 percent nationally compared with 43 
percent for onefamily detached houses 
so if you the seller live in one of those pockets of inertia 
where nobody bids on your coop or condo unit dont lose patience 
while singular factors could be involved more likely the problem 
relates to the market cycle

people seem to have a high sense of drama about me maybe they 
can enjoy my music more if they think im destroying myself 
janis joplin 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hair bristling about her shoulders in an untidy 
nest the blowsy high priestess of the blues stumbled to the stage 
spitting and cursing with two whiskey bottles in each hand janis 
joplin faced woodstock nation like a drunken gunslinger 
even through her fog she knew she didnt like this gig no way 
no how too many people hippies she managed to slur to the 
audience at the woodstock festival on aug 16 1969 had become a 
whole new minority 
many of the performances at woodstock were disappointing or 
strange or just plain bad but joplins was all three 
she was tortured and crying in the microphone recalls henry 
diltz the official woodstock photographer in woodtock the oral 
history a recently published book by joel makower 
i dont know really how to describe her i mean she really 
screamed in agony in those songs she really meant it you could 
see that in the way she contorted her face and her body and 
everything 
john morris production coordinator for the concert summed up 
it was an awful performance 
joplin had been partying strong since her arrival in the bethel 
area she hung out with country joe mcdonald at the holiday inn 
dining room and they turned it into a bar she and country joe had 
once been lovers and he wrote and performed janis a song 
about their romance 
when she walked offstage she went into a tent and i am 
sure shot up instantly recalls myra friedman joplins 
biographer in woodstock 
so it was sad and her behavior that weekend was indicative of 
her depression and addiction and booze the other thing was that 
janis was not real thrilled by the size of that crowd at all 
she said i cant relate to a quarter of a million people 
joplin had been in the business barely three years and when she 
hit woodstock she was somebody a personality a happening a 
rockblues star who raked in 30000 for every concert appearance 
and also by woodstock shed had three years of boozing drugging 
and burning out 
</TEXT>

when i get scared and worried i tell myself janis just 
have a good time so i juice up real good and thats what i have

a homely soul from port arthur texas joplin took her talent 
and guts on the road and hitchhiked with her threeoctave voice to 
san francisco just in time for the flowering of haightashbury 
she strutted through clubs in north beach and on june 11 1966 
the 23yearold whiskeysoaked mama from the little texas town 
joined big brother and the holding company the house band at san 
franciscos avalon ballroom on stage 
i couldnt believe it all that rhythm and power joplin 
later recalled i got stoned just feeling it like it was the 
best dope in the world it was so sensual so vibrant loud crazy 
i couldnt stay still i had never danced when i sang but 
there i was moving and jumping i couldnt hear myself so i sang 
louder and louder by the end i was wild 
the avalon is gone now so is joplin she was found at the 
landmark hotel in los angeles four years after her debut with big 
brother fresh needle marks in her arm the coroners report called 
it an accidental overdose of heroin 
from that day in june until her death oct 4 1970 joplin 
grabbed a generation and held it in her thrall with her raspy 
plaintive voice her coarse vulnerablitity and her tough 
independence 
a selfavowed beatnik not she would caution a hippie she 
became an icon for the woodstock generation hippies she said 
believed the world could be a better place beatniks believe 
things arent going to get better and say to hell with it stay 
stoned and have a good time 
fame came fast for joplin it happened the moment she screamed 
her way through josh whites ball and chain blues at the 
monterey pop festival in june 1967 
joplin loved the blues and her personal hero was bessie smith 
on aug 8 1970 she bought a headstone for smiths grave at the 
mount lawn cemetery in philadelphia the great blues singer died in 
1937 after being refused admission to a whitesonly hospital 
black people have the blues because they cant have this and 
they cant have that joplin once said me i was brought up in 
a middleclass family i could have had anything but you need 
something more in your gut man 
she covered many artists songs including barry and robin 
gibbs to love somebody and rodgers and harts little girl 
blue but she also wrote songs including mercedesbenz and 
with organist gabriel mekler kozmic blues 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
time keeps moving on 
friends they keep moving on or turn away 
but i never find out why 
i keep trying to make it right to another day 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
joplin released the cheap thrills lp in 1968 with big 
brother she left the band later that year because they just 
werent growing together anymore 
then the kozmic blues band was formed in 1969 and disbanded 
shortly after their one lp i got dem ol kozmic blues again 
mama shot to the top of the charts 
joplin appeared with big brother at fillmore west and winterland 
in 1969 before putting together her new group the fulltilt boogie 
band 
at the time of her death she was working on a new lp pearl 
was drawn from unfinished sessions and released in february 1971 
it had the plaintive cry baby and kris kristoffersons bobby 
mcgee with its telling refrain freedoms just another word for 
nothin left to lose 
freedom was hard for joplin to define she had fame she had 
talent she had a lot of time and independence but she was lonely 
somehow you lose all the old friends she said the travel 
circumstances pull them away its hard to make new ones when 
were not onstage we rehearse lay around in bed check in and out 
of motels watch television it really is lonely 
i live for that one hour on stage its full of feeling its 
more exciting than youd expect in a lifetime its a rush honey

vincent escaped into the depths beneath new 
york city with catherine not far behind screaming his name when 
cbs beauty and the beast ended its second season 
despite the cliffhanger the contemporary fantasy was not on 
cbs schedule for the fall season and for a short time it appeared 
vincent might never surface again 
cbs has ordered 12 new episodes said ron perlman who stars 
as the halfman halfbeast vincent 
the last we heard cbs said be ready to go back on the air as 
soon as possible so were going back into production at the same 
time we would if we had been renewed for the fall schedule 
cbs said the show will be back on sometime in the 198990 
season but fans having heard the same assurances from cbs before 
regarding franks place was cancelled are expressing their 
support for more beauty in the near future 
were letting people know that viewers for quality television 
stands ready to channel the passion and enthusiasm for the show 
said dorothy swanson vqt director by telephone from fairfax va 
there is a huge grass roots movement for this show we dont want 
to call anything were doing campaign and we discourage talk of a 
boycott we should keep our support positive 
beauty and the beast is being supported by at least 36 fan 
clubs 65 amateurpublished magazines and 40 newsletters according 
to kimberly hartman of fullerton ca who operates helpers 
network the network coordinates support from canada england and 
west germany 
we knew thered be a major confrontation over not renewing the 
show said perlman but we went from not being on the schedule 
at all to doing 12 shows thats something 
beauty and the beast has not done well in the ratings in 
its most recent appearance for the week ended july 16 it was in 
73rd place but like franks place the show has an audience 
that is vocal in its loyalty 
at the core of beauty and the beast is the idyllic love that 
develops between vincent the manbeast who lives beneath the city 
and catherine chandler the socialite crimefighting attorney 
whose life is saved by vincent 
the show also stars linda hamilton as catherine roy dotrice as 
father a brilliant recluse who also lives under the city and jay 
acovone as catherines associate in the district attorneys office 
the theme is one that goes back to pagan times and has appeared 
often in literature such as the hunchback of notre dame 
phantom of the opera and the classic childrens story beauty 
and the beast 
the show has many attractions said perlman not the least 
of which is what vincent has gone through in his own life and that 
hold him back and limit him he can see other peoples struggles 
he is a champion of the underdog he gives people his undivided 
attention 
he has an enormous physical presence that is at once repelling 
and magnetic hes from a time gone by his thirst for things of 
innate beauty is of the renaissance people know that time spent 
with this character is time spent with truth and beauty he is the 
unattainable love 
perlman said he believes that cbs has not promoted or publicized 
the show in the best manner if i was handling this show id have 
a field day he said heres a show with a concept that is so 
totally different from anything else on television you have a 
character whos unique and larger than life and straight out of 
mythology 
instead the shows been promoted like it was just another 
sitcom it makes you wonder if someone is at home i dont want to 
sound like sour grapes but i would have worked a little harder to 
point out the speciality of it 
when the part was first offered to perlman two years ago he 
nearly turned it down he had recently completed a role as a 
hunchback in the name of the rose and before that had been a 
prehistoric man in quest for fire he did not want to do any 
more roles requiring elaborate makeup but said he was won over as 
soon as he read the pilot script 
despite the makeup perlman is being recognized more and more by 
fans 
i have a high profile due to television he says i dont 
mind being successful but i hate being famous life is hard enough 
without the burden of fame it limits your choices so many aspects 
of your life then are out of your control 
perlman had been on the new york stage and in regional theater 
and made two films in europe his first movie here was the ice 
pirates last year he was in the tv movie a stoning in fulham 
county he played a member of an amish family that was being 
persecuted 
he also has a record album out on which he reads poems while the 
theme of beauty and the beast plays in the background so far 
more than 250000 albums have been sold its an outgrowth of the 
poems that vincent reads on the series

to many of the amish who inhabit 
northwestern pennsylvanias countryside lucille sykes is a 
godsend someone they know and trust to help deliver their babies 
one after another year after year 
the whiteframe threeroom cradle time birthing clinic in mrs 
sykes backyard was moved there by the amish after she bought it 
from an amish family that needed a bigger house two walls bearing 
141 cards with vital statistics and footprints the amish dont 
allow photographs are records of her work 
its just a lot more relaxing here at lucilles 29yearold 
edna troyer said one recent afternoon at the clinic made homey by 
ruffled curtains flowered bedsheets crocheted afghans and 
pictures of teddy bears and storks 
officials unimpressed by mrs sykes decade of dedication have 
gone to court to stop her from practicing midwifery without a 
license the emotional battle is stirring up normally tranquil 
people in normally tranquil parts 
im ordinarily not a person to get out and demonstrate or 
anything like that thats not my making said mrs sykes but 
i believe that what im doing is right and i believe that in order 
to have freedom i guess we have to fight for it theyve touched 
something thats very dear to my heart and that has been my life 
her amish friends and neighbors have been similarly moved they 
have set up a legal defense fund and are voicing 
uncharacteristically loud concern 
we dont think shes doing anything wrong we think shes 
doing a good job shes got the skill already they probably cant 
tell her anything she doesnt know said daniel byler 31 of new 
wilmington 
four of bylers six children were delivered by mrs sykes 
nobodys out to hurt her and im glad because shes not a 
bad woman shes a nice person she means well she really does 
but shes violating the law said mercer county children and 
youth services director gene montone 
montone says he is bound by law to protect children and that 
includes improving newborn rights he initiated an 
investigation of mrs sykes in the spring after an anonymous 
complaint a criminal charge of unlawful practice was filed against 
her for delivering bylers daughter sylvia on march 23 but was 
dropped at a may magistrates hearing attended by several hundred 
amish 
how can we go forward if we dont have a clear definition of 
midwifery district justice joseph gabany asked the press 
recently picked up on a 6yearold who delivered his brother is 
that midwifery a taxi driver who delivers a baby in a taxi is 
that a midwife 
undaunted the state board of medicine is seeking an injunction 
the overriding premise here is that the state board of 
medicine believes people in the business of delivering babies 
should be qualified and licensed said kathy liebler a 
spokeswoman for the department of state which oversees the 
11member medical board 
under pennsylvania law midwives must be licensed as registered 
or graduate nurses who have completed a midwifery course and passed 
a state exam the state has record of 131 licensed midwives 
montone is recommending one to the amish 
i dont like to disobey the states laws at all but i do 
think this is very unnecessary said an amish bishop who spoke on 
condition his name not be used i dont understand why the state 
is so concerned with this because theyre doing these abortions and 
all that kind of crap 
they dont care to murder do they why are they so concerned 
with this 
a determined mrs sykes and the pennsylvania midwives 
association are pushing for legislation to recognize the states 40 
to 50 lay midwives a local grange has joined the cause denouncing 
the harassment of mrs sykes 
about 15 states have laws that recognize midwives other than 
nurses although licensing requirements vary said sandra botting 
president of the midwives alliance of north america of 4000 to 
5000 practicing midwives in the united states and canada about 
twothirds are nurses 
midwifery is an accepted profession throughout the world its 
only here that were having this struggle and its ridiculous 
ms botting said 
mrs sykes began studying under an amish midwife in eastern 
ohios holmes county in 1976 she was encouraged by local amish 
who have no religious qualms about hospitals but prefer more 
natural home deliveries cost is also a factor mrs sykes for 
instance charges 450 per delivery and in some hardship cases has 
accepted bartered goods such as quilts and a porch swing 
every other weekend for two years she traveled from her home 
outside stoneboro to ohio to train she struck out on her own in 
1978 when an amish couple called and asked if she would assist in 
the birth of their child 
mrs sykes delivered four babies the first year 11 the next and 
22 the year after that as of july 17 she had delivered 632 babies 
at the clinic or mothers homes virtually all were amish none 
were stillborn 
the mothers are doing the delivering themselves she said 
im there to monitor to make sure everythings all right 
last year mrs sykes sent four mothers to the hospital before 
delivery two were breech deliveries with one of the babies dying 
shortly after another baby was born face first and delivered by 
caesarean section as with any firsttime mother whose cervix 
failed to dilate properly 
mrs sykes sent only one newborn to the hospital in 1988 for 
fear the lungs were underdeveloped but the infant proved to be 
fine she has sent no mothers or babies to the hospital this year 
although two infants later needed treatment one for spina bifida 
and the other for internal deformities 
once in a while i do have problems she said this is one 
reason why i say i need the doctors i need the hospital once in a 
while but generally speaking if youre careful to screen your 
mothers you take good healthy mothers youre going to have good 
healthy deliveries 
mrs sykes is proud of her record the cards on her clinic walls 
represent 110 births in 1988 and 34 as of july 17 this year 
the small birthing room contains a hospital bed oxygen tank 
stethoscope fetalscope bloodpressure monitor changing table and 
a lava lamp for mental relaxation in the large outer room are twin 
beds with cribs at the foot of each an incubator kerosene stove 
air conditioner couch and kitchen 
when edna troyer visited recently with her husband daniel in 
their horsedrawn buggy it was to announce that their eighth baby 
was due any day i didnt know if you were legal she told mrs 
sykes what would i do 
mrs sykes is back in business for now after refusing to see 
pregnant women for the five weeks charges were pending it feels 
so right working with them it feels so good but when you pick up 
a newspaper it feels so wrong 
she acknowledges she could go to nursing school now that her 
three children are grown but at 48 that doesnt look attractive 
to me 
id just as soon they leave me alone and let me go on just 
like i have been it will never be the same again im sure i just 
dont think my life will ever be the same again

amoco corp and ashland oil inc said their profits fell in the 
latest quarter while atlantic richfield co and amerada hess corp 
reported net income gains 
amoco based in chicago said monday its net income in the three 
months ended june 30 tumbled 255 percent to 497 million or 96 
cents a share from 667 million or 130 a share in the 
yearearlier period revenue rose to 68 billion from 61 billion 
a year earlier 
excluding special charges of 36 million in the second quarter 
and 136 million in onetime gains in the yearearlier period 
amocos earnings were flat at about 530 million the company said 
arco based in los angeles reported net income of 467 million 
or 266 a share a 167 percent increase from the 400 million or 
219 a share earned in the same period last year revenue dropped 
to 43 billion from 46 billion 
ashlands net income declined 228 percent in the quarter to 44 
million or 78 cents a share from 57 million or 102 a share 
revenue rose to 22 billion from 21 billion 
amerada hess reported net income of 1335 million or 165 a 
share compared with a net loss of 235 million or 29 cents a 
share in the second quarter of 1988 revenue totaled 15 billion 
up 67 percent from 8828 million 
analysts said higher crude oil prices in the quarter contributed 
to healthier exploration and production earnings for most oil 
companies while squeezing refining margins crude prices were up 
nearly 3 a barrel during the quarter compared with the 
yearearlier period 
much of the higher crude costs were passed on to consumers 
through higher gasoline prices which have skyrocketed since march 
analysts said 
for companies with foreign operations the strong dollar also 
cut into profit margins as product prices became less competitive 
overseas 
for the first six months of 1989 amocos earnings fell 162 
percent to 955 million or 185 a share vs 114 billion or 
221 a share in the comparable 1988 period revenue totaled 133 
billion up from 118 billion in the same 1988 period 
amoco said a big decline in chemical earnings offset gains in 
exploration and production and refining and marketing 
analysts said weakness in the chemical sector reflected an 
overall softening of the us economy 
arcos first half net income nearly doubled to 12 billion or 
666 a share from 801 million or 439 a share revenue totaled 
83 billion down from 92 billion in the 1988 period 
arco said it benefited from higher crude prices record coal 
production increased domestic gas production and increased 
refining and marketing earnings 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year ashland had net 
income of 126 million or 226 a share up 68 percent from 118 
million or 210 a share in the yearearlier period the 1988 
results excluded 40 million or 71 cents a share added due to 
accounting changes 
ninemonth revenue for the ashland kybased company rose to 
62 billion from 6 billion 
new yorkbased amerada hess said its firsthalf net income grew 
to 3537 million or 435 a share from 422 million or 51 
cents a share in the 1988 half revenue rose to 296 billion from 
21 billion a year earlier 
exploration and production earnings surged to 28 million from 
12 million in the second quarter of 1988 while the companys 
refining and marketing sector recovered from a 65 million loss 
last year to post a 1255 million profit in the quarter

industry analysts expressed surprise at exxon 
corps costs for cleaning up the alaska oil spill which the 
worlds largest oil company blamed in part for a 1 billion plunge 
in its secondquarter profit 
theyre spending close to 40 million a week instead of the 
20 million that they estimated earlier frank p knuettel of 
prudential bache securities said monday after exxon announced its 
earnings 
also surprising was that exxons results did not provide for an 
aftertax credit on the oil spill losses observers said the 
company has said that it would write off the cleanup expense as a 
cost of doing business 
a bill pending in congress would ban exxon from deducting the 
costs of the cleanup 
they can still take it later on but for now its probably a 
politically smart move said bruce lazier an analyst with 
prescott ball amp turben inc 
exxon said that a special provision in the second quarter for 
expenses and insurance claims stemming from the march 24 spill in 
alaskas prince william sound reduced its net income by 850 
million or 67 cents a share 
exxon said its net income fell 87 percent to 160 million or 13 
cents a share from 12 billion or 90 cents a share in the 
comparable 1988 quarter 
without the provision earnings would have declined by 16 
percent to 1 billion due to weaker refining profit margins a 
stronger dollar and the us economic slowdown exxon said 
the new yorkbased company said the estimated provision includes 
600 million already spent on the cleanup as well as estimated 
future outlays but does not include the cost of any lawsuits 
the provision is in addition to insurance coverage of more than 
400 million that will go toward cleaning up the 11 million gallons 
of spilled crude exxon said 
secondquarter revenue for exxon rose 9 percent to 236 
billion from 2163 billion 
so far 143 suits have been filed against the company 138 
seeking damages and five derivative suits by shareholders in 
connection with the spill from a grounded exxon tanker that fouled 
hundreds of miles of water and coastline 
environmentalists and a number of government officials have 
criticized exxons handling of the spill contending the company 
was inadequately prepared for the disaster 
alaska officials also were dismayed monday when the oil company 
said it would not change its plan to withdraw its oil spill cleanup 
forces from prince william sound by midseptember for the winter 
cleanup of the alaskan oil spill was exxons top priority in 
the quarter exxon chairman lawrence g rawl said in the 
companys earnings statement the magnitude of the required 
effort is huge and therefore costly 
but rawl said exxons financial position remains strong 
we are continuing to pursue our longterm business strategies 
and to implement planned capital programs he said 
for the first six months of 1989 exxons provision for the 
alaska oil spill totaled 880 million including 30 million 
charged in the first quarter exxons earnings totaled 14 
billion or 112 a share for the first six months down 46 
percent from 266 billion or 196 a share in the first half of 
1988 
excluding the spill provision exxons first half earnings were 
23 billion or 181 a share down 13 percent revenue for the 
first half rose to 4586 billion from 4363 billion a year 
earlier a 5 percent improvement 
exxon said it increased capital and exploration expenditures 
about 22 percent in the quarter to 22 billion from 18 billion 
although secondquarter crude prices were 285abarrel higher 
than a year earlier earnings from exploration and production 
declined by 10 million to 693 million 
exxon said higher crude prices were offset by higher foreign 
taxes and lower production at its north sea facilities stemming 
from accidents and pipeline problems 
refining and marketing earnings declined 49 million from last 
year to 232 million reflecting lower margins in foreign markets 
and lack of improvement in us markets compared with a year 
earlier 
analysts said the dollars strength against foreign currencies 
hurt all oil companies operating overseas a higher dollar makes 
us products more expensive in foreign markets 
also a slowdown in the us economy contributed to lower 
earnings in the companys chemicals sector as the price of some 
products declined

the investment group proposing to buy 
northwest airlines parent company for 365 billion says it is on 
the brink of closing the deal as the airline continues contract 
talks with its pilots 
more than 99 percent of the shares of nwa inc have been 
tendered to wings holdings inc alfred checchi the former 
marriott corp treasurer who heads the group said monday 
checchi said his financing was nearly in place and he was 
pressing for early termination of the waiting period before 
finalizing the deal as required under the hartscottrodino 
antitrust improvement act the waiting period is scheduled to 
expire wednesday 
the federal trade commission did not issue a ruling monday on 
his request 
the 121ashare tender offer originally was set to expire at 
midnight friday but checchi extended it to 5 pm edt monday 
david duffy a wings spokesman in new york said the offer may be 
extended again 
northwest airlines pilots union and nwa resumed contract talks 
monday with the help of josh javits chairman of the national 
mediation board the union said talks were to continue today 
an agreement with the pilots is considered crucial to checchis 
plans to acquire the airline because a strike could impair his 
ability to generate enough cash to pay for the acquisition which 
will total more than 4 billion 
under federal regulations if the pilots request that 
negotiations be declared at an impasse they could strike after a 
30day coolingoff period 
tim thornton an nwa vice president and its general counsel 
said the primary issues remaining to be settled include wages work 
rules and job security 
in another development monday the state of north dakota sued to 
block checchis bid to buy northwest saying the deal would violate 
what it called the airlines 1986 promise to avoid excessive fare 
increases in the state 
the suit filed in us district court in bismarck contends 
that if the sale is consummated the airline wont be able to pay 
off its debts without cutting back service laying off workers and 
raising fares 
meanwhile nwa reported record secondquarter earnings monday of 
708 million or 238 a share the profit was more than double 
that of the second quarter a year ago when the airline earned 
284 million or 97 cents a share 
revenues for the second quarter increased 193 percent from 
138 billion in the 1988 period to 165 billion the company said 
chairman steven rothmeier said passenger traffic increased 16 
percent over the second quarter of 1988 with capacity growing 156 
percent the airline also experienced a 168 percent increase in 
freight revenues from 1135 million in last years second quarter 
to 1326 million 
earnings for the first half were 833 million or 282 a 
share on sales of 313 billion that compared with a 151 
million net loss for the first six months of 1988 when revenues 
were 262 billion

honeywell inc has announced a sweeping 
restructuring in which it will cut 4000 jobs retreat from its 
14 billion weapons business and provide added cash to 
shareholders 
the changes unveiled monday will make honeywell less attractive 
to corporate raiders 
the restructuring will include the sale of a substantial 
portion of the companys 50 percent stake in yamatakehoneywell 
a japanese controls maker analysts have valued the holding at 
nearly 1 billion 
chairman james renier also said the company will repurchase up 
to 10 million shares of its common stock on the open market and 
increase the annual dividend by 31 percent beginning in the fourth 
quarter 
a special cash dividend to shareholders is possible renier 
said but did not elaborate he also predicted a 150 million 
improvement in operating profits of remaining businesses over the 
next 18 months because of the restructuring 
honeywell will focus on its main business of controls which 
range from home thermostats to automation equipment for paper mills 
and chemical plants 
honeywell stock closed up 387 a share to 8937 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
asked if the restructuring would deter a possible hostile 
takeover renier said obviously if you enhance shareholder 
value thats definitely beneficial from that point of view 
honeywells stock price has risen sharply in the last several 
weeks following published reports that general electric co was 
considering acquiring the company general electric has denied the 
rumors saying it has no interest in honeywell 
takeover speculation sprouted after honeywell announced a 435 
million loss in fiscal 1988 the rumors also were fueled by the 
defeat in a proxy fight last year of two takeover defenses proposed 
by management 
the group that led the proxy fight north american partners of 
fort worth texas praised the restructuring move 
this is a new management group determined to get the company 
focused in on its real jewels the controls business said 
spokesman eddie lampert whose group owns between 4 percent and 5 
percent of honeywell stock we think the stock will move 
significantly higher when they execute the plan 
the restructuring is obviously a defensive move said kurt 
rivard of minneapolisbased dain bosworth inc raiders will be 
discouraged because the sale of assets by honeywell will reduce the 
breakup value of the company rivard said 
the increased stock price also would make a takeover more 
expensive said john mcmanus a securities analyst with thomson 
mckinnon securities inc in new york 
but mcmanus and rivard said the restructuring wont guarantee 
independence to honeywell 
renier is making sure the shareholders are rewarded for their 
ownership but it doesnt rule out someone making a run at the 
company rivard said 
honeywell intends to reduce its dependence on weapons production 
but it will keep its business of making aviation and space 
controls which are sold to the military as well as other 
customers the company said 
honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the us 
navy and supplies the us army with ammunition for tanks 
antitank weapons small airdelivered munitions and mines said 
company spokeswoman susan eich 
weapon sales last year were about 14 billion or about 20 
percent of honeywells 71 billion in revenue 
overall defense contracting including the parts such as 
avionics that are being kept totaled 35 to 45 percent of honeywell 
sales last year renier said 
renier would not say whether a sale of the weapons business is 
one of the options being considered but defense department 
spokesman glenn flood said honeywells contracts could be assumed 
by another company that bought the business from honeywell rivard 
the dain bosworth analyst said such a sale could bring the company 
about 1 billion 
the reduction in weapons production will proceed over time in 
a responsible manner that recognizes the us governments interest 
in these businesses so as not to adversely affect national security 
interests our government program obligations or the value of 
these businesses to honeywell shareholders renier said 
negotiations to sell the companys stake in yamatakehoneywell 
which is listed on the tokyo stock exchange will begin within a 
few days honeywell spokeswoman kathy tunheim said 
she would not identify potential buyers japanese investors 
currently own half of the company she said 
honeywells restructuring program will include the elimination 
of 4000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months including 300 
corporate staff positions targeted in an announcement last month 
renier said 
honeywell currently employs about 78000 workers many of the 
job cuts will be made through attrition but some layoffs will be 
necessary tunheim said

at golenberg amp co shirley shiffman and her husband george both 
of aurora ohio

about the thenunpublicized buyout that she should have kept 
secret to her husband who allegedly made 46377 trading revco 
common stock and option contracts

dworkins reaction to the buyout price there was no allegation of

time inc and warner communications inc 
have begun forming the worlds largest communications concern after 
a delaware court cleared the way for the merger 
a threejustice panel of the delaware supreme court on monday 
upheld a lower courts decision that denied an injunction sought by 
paramount communications inc to block times 14 billion tender 
offer for warner 
after the ruling paramount abandoned its 200pershare 122 
billion hostile takeover attempt of time 
after more than two hours of arguments the states highest 
court upheld a july 14 chancery court ruling that said the proposed 
timewarner merger was the result of longrange planning by the two 
companys boards and that paramount and time shareholders opposed 
to the deal could not interfere 
we find no error of law by the court of chancery justice 
henry r horsey ruled from the bench he said a written opinion 
would be issued later 
paramount attorney melvyn cantor declined to comment on the 
ruling 
time attorney robert joffe praised the decision saying delaware 
law was clearly on our side 
the ruling affirmed the rights of corporate directors to decide 
the future course of their companies in the face of hostile bids 
it could have widespread importance since more than half of the 
fortune 500 companies are incorporated in delaware as are time 
paramount and warner 
paramount which announced its hostile takeover attempt seven 
weeks ago said in a statement that it would continue to try to 
expand through acquisitions mergers joint ventures or 
partnerships however it said it would not make a bid for the new 
time warner inc 
under its 70ashare offer time was to purchase slightly more 
than half of warners common stock and exchange a combination of 
cash and securities valued at 70 a share for the rest 
times tender offer for warner expired at 5 pm edt monday 
time said today it had been tendered about 176 million warner 
shares of which 100 million were accepted for the cash part of the 
offer time said it now owns 593 percent of warners stock 
checks will be mailed out to shareholders beginning on monday 
time has not yet determined the breakdown of the 
cashandsecurities portion of the deal which is expected to take 
several months to complete 
in his earlier ruling chancery judge william t allen noted 
that the proposed timewarner deal was announced in march three 
months before paramount announced its bid for time 
paramount however contended that once time announced plans to 
merge with warner it effectively placed itself up for sale 
paramount asserted that under delaware law time then had to 
consider paramounts offer 
cantor the paramount attorney argued monday before the supreme 
court that times board had a duty to inquire into paramounts 
initial 175ashare buyout offer 
we dont question that timewarner is a good deal cantor 
said but he contended time shareholders should have been allowed 
to vote on whether paramount was offering a better deal in the 
short term 
michael klein an attorney for major time shareholders 
including texas investor robert m bass said thousands of the 
companys stockholders opposed the timewarner merger klein said 
that based on previous delaware court rulings the time board was 
obligated to consider paramounts offer 
supreme court justice andrew gt moore interjected however 
that kleins argument would make a board hostage to anyone who 
walked in with a bid regardless of a companys longrange plans 
the justices asked time attorney joffe why times tender offer 
for warner which replaced an earlier stockswap merger plan was 
not submitted to a vote by time shareholders at the companys 
annual meeting in june 
joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not 
involve the issuing of new time stock he also said that after 
paramount announced its bid on june 6 the market for time stock 
was in disarray and the share price was seesawing 
this was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned 
evaluation of future value and get a fair vote he said 
attorneys for time and warner both contended the merger would 
give shareholders greater value in the long run than paramounts 
offer 
after the ruling klein said the high courts decision tilted 
delaware law in favor of management he predicted that attorneys 
would advise corporations to develop an appearance of a longterm 
plan to ward off potential takeover bids 
the ruling was widely expected on wall street time stock closed 
down 1 monday at 13750 a share warner stock rose 162 to 
6612 a share and paramount rose 187 to 5937 a share 
time stock which traded at 126 a share before the paramount 
bid rose to a high of 18275 before falling in recent weeks as 
investors became increasingly pessimistic about paramounts chances

thought time inc and warner communications inc 
are proceeding with their merger the two arent exactly picking up 
where they left off on june 6 when paramount communications inc 
tried to spoil the plan 
time and warner which originally planned to merge in a stock 
swap transaction revised the deal in response to paramounts 107 
billion hostile bid for time providing instead for time to acquire 
warner in a 14 billion 70ashare tender offer 
that offer expired at 5 pm monday several hours after the 
delaware supreme court upheld a lower court ruling allowing the 
merger to proceed 
time said today it had been tendered approximately 176 million 
of warners 200 million outstanding common shares and now owns 
approximately 593 percent of the companys stock 
starting monday warner stockholders will be paid 70 a share in 
cash for slightly more than 100 million shares time will exchange 
the rest at some point in the future possibly several months 
for a combination of cash and securities valued at 70 a share the 
socalled back end of the deal will take place when the 
timewarner merger is consummated 
it is not known what kind of securities will be issued but they 
could include new shares of time common stock 
warner stock rose 162 to 6612 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange before the tender offer expired 
the original merger agreement announced in march required the 
approval of time and warner stockholders but times acquisition of 
warner does not require shareholder votes 
warner shareholders must approve the deal but they effectively 
will do so by tendering their stock to time when a shareholder 
vote is held time inc effectively will be the only shareholder 
after the acquisition is completed times name will change to 
time warner inc and warner stock will cease trading on the new 
york stock exchange 
the corporate structure of the merged company will at first 
largely resemble time and warner as they are now 
j richard munro 58 now the chairman of time and steven ross 
61 the warner chairman will serve as cochairmen and cochief 
executive officers at time warner after both eventually retire 
nj nicholas jr now times president and soon to be time 
warners president is expected to head the company 
the two companies corporate staffs will be integrated but 
weve vowed there would be no job loss as a result of the 
merger said louis slovinsky a time spokesman 
warners cable television operations will report to joseph 
collins the head of times cable division and warners book 
publishing division will report to the head of times publishing 
unit kelso sutton slovinsky said 
no other changes were contemplated immediately 
the companies have denied they plan to sell any assets to help 
finance the deal but published reports say executives have 
targeted some divisions including times scott foresman amp co 
book publisher as possible candidates for sale 
some 500 warner executives and employees reportedly would be 
paid a total of about 677 million under stock option and bonus 
plans under the merger 
warner chairman steven ross would receive 193 million in 
payments and also would receive options on 18 million time warner 
shares 
the payments which were outlined in minutes of a june 15 
warner board meeting are considered the largestever compensation 
package for employees of a company involved in a takeover

house investigators said today their yearlong 
probe of alleged misconduct at the internal revenue service 
revealed serious integrity problems and wrongdoing by some senior 
officials 
investigator leonard bernard said there has been a serious 
failure on the part of the irs national office to effectively 
manage employee integrity programs 
our investigation revealed for example that on a number of 
occasions irs national office officials at the highest levels 
ignored instances of wrongdoing by senior managers in washington 
dc and elsewhere bernard said 
he said he could not quantify the extent of the wrongdoing but 
he said the probe revealed significant integrity problems exist 
among officials at this level 
wrongdoing by irs senior managers is too often ignored 
entirely or ineptly investigated resulting in a clearance for the 
wrongdoers bernard said 
his testimony opened three days of hearings on the irs before 
the house government operations subcommittee on commerce consumer 
and monetary affairs 
bernard said a pervasive fear exists among irs employees 
that they will suffer personally if they report misconduct by their 
superiors or cooperate in an investigation 
in the cases investigated by the subcommittee said bernard 
instances of retaliation against those reporting wrongdoing 
outnumber by far the instances of punhishment of the wrongdoer 
bernard noted that one of eight misconduct cases he and other 
subcommittee aides have been probing involved senior officials up 
to the level of deputy assistant commissioner 
most attention has been focused on allegations that a former 
boss of the criminal investigation division in los angeles was 
offered a bribe by guess inc a jeans manufacturer to get an 
investigation of a rival jordache enterprises the irs cleared 
that official ronald saranow last year 
subcommittee investigators have checked several cases in which 
irs employees who called attention to misconduct inside the agency 
were subsequently demoted or forced out 
the subcommittee chaired by rep doug barnard dga called 
for three days of testimony from the irs present and former irs 
employees and the general accounting office 
the irs has declined comment on the allegations citing laws 
that prohibit disclosure of information about individual tax cases 
or about employees under investigation 
in recent interviews however top irs officials defended the 
agencys record in policing itself 
the agency has an inspection division of 1300 people to police 
120000 irs employees noted senior deputy commissioner michael j 
murphy and a criminal investigation division of 4700 to watch 
over the conduct of more than 100 million taxpayers 
the inspection division conducts about 2000 investigations of 
allegations against employees each year and about 48 percent of 
the cases involve complaints from other employees said teddy r 
kern assistant commissioner for inspection 
the irs is one of the few federal agencies that require 
employees to report wrongdoing by colleagues kern said president 
bush soon will seek to impose the same requirement on all federal 
employees as part of his ethicsingovernment recommendations 
we do look pretty strictly at responsibilities and the code of 
conduct that all irs employees must sign kern said 
if during an investigation of irs employees we come up with 
any violation of federal law we will refer the case to the us 
attorney or if it is on an executive or highlevel officials we 
will refer it to the justice department kern said 
in addition irs inspectors automatically refer to the treasury 
departments inspector general any allegation of criminal 
wrongdoing by any of the 2000 irs highlevel officials and 
executives 
in 1987 88 irs employees were convicted of crimes including 
embezzlement selling narcotics and accepting bribes following 
investigations by the agencys inspection division 
the most highly publicized case of irs wrongdoing in recent 
years was in the philadelphia district office where 14 people 
including fashion designer albert nippon were convicted as a 
result of a bribery investigation bribes totaling more than 1 
million were paid to irs employees

control data corp on tuesday reported a 
secondquarter loss of 4973 million a debacle forecast by 
company officials in april when they dumped the eta systems 
supercomputer subsidiary and slashed 3100 jobs 
the bulk of the loss was from special onetime charges 
although the company also lost about 25 million on the businesses 
it has retained including interest expenses 
control data once one of the worlds largest computer makers 
has been steadily shrinking in a struggle to achieve sustained 
profitability 
with those activities largely behind us and an amended credit 
agreement in place we can concentrate on control datas ongoing 
businesses and work to achieve a profitable second half of the 
year chairman robert price said 
the loss on sales of 8043 million compares with net earnings 
of 92 million or 22 cents a share in the second quarter of 
1988 when sales were 9517 million 
the secondquarter earnings plunge meant a loss of 4938 
million for the first six months of the year 
shutting down st paulbased eta cost control data about 335 
million slightly less than the 350 million originally estimated 
the balance of the charges came from shrinking the cyber mainframe 
division paying severance to cover corporate staff layoffs and the 
companys departure from the training and education business price 
said 
price said losses in the mainframe business computer 
maintenance services and semiconductor division were only partially 
offset by profits at imprimis the companys disk drive subsidiary 
last month the company said it was selling imprimis to seagate 
technology inc for about 450 million in cash and securities the 
proceeds from that sale wont be booked until the deal closes 
probably this fall a control data spokesman said 
control data discontinued eta saying it was too expensive to 
operate in 1988 the fledgling supercomputer business had losses 
of about 100 million the division never made money for control 
data

president bush said today he will extend steel 
import quotas against 29 countries in an effort to spur 
negotiations on ending unfair trade practices abroad 
bush said he has directed us trade representative carla a 
hills to negotiate a 30month extension of the voluntary restraint 
agreements that currently limit the countries involved to 184 
percent of the us market 
the quotas first imposed by the reagan administration in 1984 
had been set to expire sept 30 they have limited steel imports 
from 29 countries including japan south korea brazil and the 
european community into the united states 
i am taking this step to permit the negotiation of an 
international consensus to remove unfair trade practices and to 
provide more time for the industry to adjust and modernize bush 
said in a statement released by the white house 
a few days before last novembers election bush wrote a letter 
to sen john heinz rpa pledging to renew the import quotas in 
some form 
nevertheless there was a major debate inside the bush 
administration on whether to retain the quotas in any form in view 
of its strong free market philosophy 
in extending the voluntary agreements for a transitional period 
bush said i am mindful of the need to improve the availability 
of steel in the united states and to promote price competition 
he said he was instructing the department of commerce to 
expedite and streamline a socalled short supply mechanism that 
allows us steel users to bypass the quotas if the type of steel 
they need is in shortage 
bush said that during this transition to an open market the 
ceiling on imports from vra voluntary restraint agreement 
countries will be increased at an annual rate of one percentage 
point 
the increase in allowable imports will be allocated to 
countries that undertake and abide by disciplines to address 
tradedistorting practices he said 
bush said he has also directed hills to seek to negotiate 
through the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations and 
other bilateral agreements an international consensus on how to end 
government subsidies of steel 
bush said the extended quotas will end on march 31 1992 
thereafter us steel producers like other american 
industries will continue to rely on domestic trade laws as an 
ultimate assurance against the effects of foreign unfair trade 
practices he said 
for decades governments have supported their steel producers 
through subsidies and import restrictions steel trade and the 
international trading system as a whole have suffered said bush 
this selfdefeating rivalry must end i urge our trading 
partners to work with us to restore free and fair trade to world 
markets 
us steel manufacturers had lobbied intensely for an extension 
of the import quotas which they maintain have helped rebuild an 
industry buffeted by huge losses in the early 1980s 
but some major steel customers including caterpillar inc and 
dozens of smaller companies had lobbied with equal vigor against 
extending the quotas which they charged had artifically driven up 
the price of the steel they buy 
they complained that the higher priced steel was forcing them to 
charge more for the products they make and impairing us ability 
to compete in international markets 
the us steel industry has become profitable again after 
reducing capacity and closing many older inefficient mills 
advocates of the import quotas contended the us mills needed more 
time to rebuild without unfettered competition from foreign 
countries that heavily subsidize steel exports 
the original reagan quotas set annual limits on the amount of 
steel that 29 nations may ship into the united states 
the american iron and steel institute reported last week that 
steel imports fell sharply in the first five months of 1989 when 
foreign steel represented just 171 percent of the us market

transportation secretary samuel skinner on 
tuesday defended exxons plans to stop the cleanup of the alaskan 
oil spill sept 15 saying the company is living up to its 
obligations 
the secretary who oversees the coast guard and was put in 
charge of the cleanup by president bush also said it doesnt 
trouble him that exxon will not commmit to doing work next year 
before it assesses the need for additional cleanup next spring 
but a spokesman for interior secretary manuel lujan said exxons 
obligation does not end in september alaskas governor said he 
expects exxon to fulfill a promise to stay until the job was 
done 
lujan spokesman steve goldstein said the secretary has stated 
all along that exxon is fully liable and responsible for that 
accident and they have an obligation to ensure full mitigation of 
damages and to restore prince william sound back to its original 
splendor 
skinner said that based on his own visits to the cleanup site 
he believes the people of alaska are satisfied with exxons 
performance 
exxon basically has done everything they told the government 
and me they would do skinner said 
skinner said unfavorable weather after sept 15 could make 
cleanup efforts hazardous 
i think exxons concerns are safetyrelated he said at an 
informal news conference the date doesnt surprise me 
skinner had been critical of the oil companys early efforts 
after its exxon valdez tanker hit a reef march 24 and caused the 
largest oil spill in us history about 11 million gallons of 
alaskan crude oil escaped into prince william sound 
an army of 11000 people 1000 vessels and more than 70 
aircraft has been mopping up along miles of shorelines stained by 
the oil skinner estimated exxons expenses at between 5 million 
and 10 million a day 
the oil giant on monday indicated the cost of cleaning up the 
spill would total about 125 billion and was a major factor behind 
a plunge in its second quarter earnings 
state officials reacted angrily to exxons plan to pull out 
cleanup forces by midseptember saying crews should stay until the 
area is clean 
its not enough to declare victory and go home alaskan gov 
steve cowper said monday virtually from the beginning exxon 
promised alaskans that the company would stay until the job was 
done i expect them to fulfill that promise 
surveys by the state and the coast guard indicate only about 
onethird of the cleanup work either has been completed or is in 
progress the governor said 
otto harrison exxons general manager in valdez said in a july 
19 memo to company officials that no winter cleanup operations will 
be conducted because of safety and operational reasons and the 
companys only commitment for next spring is to survey the 
shorelines 
steve provant onscene oil spill coordinator for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation said the oil company 
should leave some crews behind to deal with oil that may wash off 
beaches and cause problems during the winter 
skinner said he agreed with exxon that working in the winter 
could pose serious risks from a safety viewpoint 
he said some people in government and some environmentalists 
have had a tendency to bash exxon just to bash them 
i dont think these people reflect the opinions of the people 
in alaska who have watched this effort go forward the secretary 
said 
skinner said he will continue to push for legislation that sets 
liability for oil spills the next spiller he said may not be 
as willing as exxon to accept responsibility for the cleanup

look out nintendo 
the newest player in home video games is out to zap and blast 
your super mario brothers with special effects so dazzling that its 
electronic athletes dance homerun shuffles and its space battles 
display arcadequality flash 
dad i got to get this system this is the greatest game i 
ever saw well sell the nintendo said joe silverman 9 after a 
trial run on the turbografx16 system made by nec home electronics 
usa inc 
ditching nintendo seems like heresy it is the hottestselling 
toy in america and super mario brothers named for its mustachioed 
heroes the most popular game 
yet the 20 people who played the systems in a weeklong 
sidebyside trial by the associated press unanimously praised 
necs sharper graphics blazing color and better sound 
necs system due in stores in november has twice the computing 
power and at least twice the pricetag the basic unit lists at 
199 with a compact disc option for an extra 399 game cartridges 
the size of a credit card will sell for 45 and about 20 games 
will be available 
a nintendo unit costs about 80 its 120 games sell for 25 to 
40 
but even a telecommunications giant like nec is going to need 
more than heavyweight wizardry to challenge nintendo which 
monopolizes 80 percent of the video game market 
nineyearold emmet ohanlon preferred necs graphics during a 
test run but said i wouldnt trade nintendo at all no way 
josh taylor 19 agreed after playing a baseball game that 
features a postgame show and lacks only gold chains and pine tar 
for realism 
nec blows it away its far superior still he said if i 
owned a nintendo i dont know if id go out and buy the new one 
jenny boyd 12 said it would take a million dollars to give 
up my nintendo but after playing nec she told her 10yearold 
sister start saving your money any money we get will go toward 
this this is a fresh game 
like nintendo the nec system is a game kids and some adults 
cant stop playing in a space battle whiteknuckled players raced 
to see who can go the farthest and blast the most aliens in 
pinball getting the high score earned bragging rights 
james herman 9 was particularly awestruck by one nec game in 
which a karatechopping warrior battles bullies the heros eyes 
blink his side bruises and his mouth bleeds 
thats what i call excellent graphics james said this is 
such an awesome game 
necs gadgetry has a 16bit microprocessor twice the power of a 
nintendo a bit measures how much information the processor can 
handle at once nintendo is testing a soupedup version and a sega 
of america inc subsidiary of japans sega enterprises ltd also 
has a 16bit system on the market 
but experts say marketing and game appeal may mean more than raw 
computing power 
the 16bit guys are looking for a small niche of the market i 
cant believe theyre going to upend nintendo said larry carlat 
editor of toy amp hobby world magazine after all those kids and 
parents have invested in nintendo now youre telling them to put 
it away in a closet and start all over again with more money for 
better graphics 
the battle for the hearts and minds of video game players is far 
from childs play because of the megabucks at stake 
nintendo of america inc sold 17 billion worth of games last 
year and sales should reach 26 billion this year since it 
introduced its boxy toy in 1985 nintendo has sold 13 million in 
the united states and expects to have 19 million sold by years end 
more than 50 million game cartridges will be bought this year 
the hottest game super mario brothers is a morality play that 
weaves a mustachioed mario or his brother luigi each a blipping 
everyman through an electronic labyrinth of waterfalls and secret 
passages 
the farther mario goes in the fantasy yarn the tougher the 
surrealistic obstacles and hes apt to die a thousand deaths 
before rescuing the princess from the evil wart by flinging 
vegetables at antagonists 
one of the newest games wheel of fortune has an electronic 
handclapping letterturning vanna white 
in one symptom of video madness stores that rent movies now 
boost profits by renting nintendo games a tollfree nintendo 
hotline handles 50000 calls a week from players desperate for tips 
on how to overcome villains and obstacles 
nintendo also offers a gadget that allows the handicapped to 
play by using sips and puffs of air instead of their hands 
it gives you something to do for a couple of hours a day its 
pretty addictive said wheelchairbound kenny dvorchak 25 of 
uniontown pa who was paralyzed from the neck down in a 1983 
accident 
the countrys fascination with video games the marriage of 
television and computers began in 1972 when atari founder nolan 
bushnell created pong a beeping blip batted with paddles 
pong was in the first generation of home video games that came 
out in 1975 the newest ones are much more sophisticated 
theyre very compelling theyre so convenient exciting and 
accessible said david surrey professor of urban studies at st 
peters college in jersey city nj the games are a repetition 
of ageold themes its still cowboys and indians the boys save 
the girls and theres a fear of outsiders where you shoot aliens 
and monsters 
all games are addictive if theyre good said brian 
suttonsmith a psychologist at the university of pennsylvania 
theres nothing wrong with that its the nature of good play 
why shouldnt kids be addicted usually they grow out of their 
addiction

nintendos success story sounds almost as 
improbable as the plots of some of its video games 
in 1985 a year in which us video game sales slid to 100 
million from more than 3 billion three years earlier nintendo 
chose to test its homecomputergame machine in the new york market 
those tests told the japanese toy company it could score big in 
the united states with its nintendo entertainment system that turns 
a television into a game screen 
thanks to the popularity of its games nintendo revived a 
moribund us market to become undisputed champ of home computer 
games only recently have serious rivals emerged particularly nec 
corp another japanese company 
while nintendo thrived american companies such as atari corp 
and its predecessor that pioneered the home video game concept 
were nursing wounds suffered from mismanaging the boom of the early 
1980s 
a reason why the initial phenomenon faded in the united states 
was that companies failed to control creation and marketing 
allowing a proliferation of dull games 
analysts also say the fad that started in 1972 fizzled because 
the industry was hampered by the limitations in computer chip 
memory of the early 1980s 
enter nintendo of america inc the american corporate offspring 
of 100yearold nintendo co ltd a kyoto japanbased company 
that started as a maker of playing cards 
from its initial tests nintendo has played its cards wisely 
including close monitoring of the development and distribution of 
games 
most of the cartridges that fit into nintendos plastic 
electronic boxes are published and sold by outside software 
specialists through licenses nintendo restricts its software 
creators such as in the number of games they can bring out in a 
year nintendo has about 50 licensees for software and accessories 
such as joysticks it also has its own software development staff 
but the bulk of the work is subcontracted 
nintendo also closely tracks demand and yanks poor sellers 
weve had a philosophy of weeding the garden says peter t 
main vice president of marketing at nintendo of america 
there are 120 nintendo titles available in the united states 
currently retailing for roughly 30 to 40 a piece 
now a second round in the video game battle is beginning 
nec is challenging nintendos dominance with a system that 
boasts greater computing power 
the technology thats in our machines allows the software to 
deliver a more realistic fantasy says ken wirt assistant vice 
president for home entertainment at nec home electronics usa 
inc an american subsidiary of the japanese computer and 
telecommunications powerhouse 
necs turbografx16 to be available in toy and electronics 
stores this autumn contains a 16bit graphics processor double 
the capacity of nintendos the 16bit processor allows turbografx 
to deliver clearer more detailed images faster action sequences 
and a wider range of colors 
the brain of the turbografx is still an 8bit chip the same as 
nintendos but wirt says that chip doesnt need additional oomph 
were not solving differential equations here says wirt 
video games are mostly visual and audio theyre not calculation 
intensive 
turbografx which will retail for about 200 or about twice the 
price of the basic nintendo system has been designed to 
accommodate optional equipment such as a compact disc player and 
an audiovideo enhancer 
wirt says the higher pricetag on necs system is justified 
because research indicates that 8 to 16yearolds the target age 
group will play nec games twice as long as the 60 hours or so 
spent playing a nintendo game 
backing up the fancy hardware is necs considerable corporate 
clout the company dwarfs nintendo with worldwide annual sales of 
about 22 billion vs nintendos 15 billion in 1988 nec has a 
research and development budget and a staff size that far exceed 
nintendos 
another contender for market share is sega of america inc 
subsidiary of japans sega enterprises ltd veteran of video 
arcades al nilsen director of marketing says the companys 
genesis 16bit system which also will retail for around 200 has 
gotten glowing reviews and orders from retailers are surpassing 
expectations sega will start shipping genesis in september 
features that could give sega an edge include the optional 
telegenesis modem and software that will allow videophiles to link 
through telephone lines and play video baseball against each other 
other games will be introduced next year for use with telegenesis 
the price of telegenesis will be about 100 and using it will cost 
the price of a phone call 
sega says genesis will bring many of the popular arcade 
classics such as altered beast into the home and reproduce 
arcadequality graphics 
nintendo claims it still can knock out the competition by 
introducing dozens of hot games this year including tetris a 
game designed in the soviet union and dragon warrior 
also nintendos handheld game boy system with its 
stateoftheart technology and stereo sound is expected to be a 
hit although toy industry analysts have speculated that the 
portable model could steal sales from regular nintendo systems 
nintendo has forecast sales this year at 26 billion up from 
1988s 17 billion the entire industry nintendo says will post 
sales of 34 billion this year compared with 23 billion last 
year 
the deciding factor in how much market share competitors grab 
from nintendo probably will be the games themselves not the 
hardware 
robert holmes chief operating officer of acclaim entertainment 
inc a major nintendo software licensee says most video game 
developers and marketers already have aligned themselves with 
nintendo 
nintendos devices are in an estimated 17 percent of american 
households and nintendo projects its hardware will be in 26 percent 
of all us homes by the end of this year 
nintendos position in the marketplace is akin to a tidal 
wave they have the loyalty of the gaming public because of the 
diversity of the software says holmes adding that nec and sega 
lack a broad assortment of games 
nec plans to have about 20 titles in stores by christmas and 
sega expects to have 20 to 25 
paul valentine a toy industry analyst at standard amp poors 
corp says the competition is intensifying at a time when the 
market for the games could be peaking 
there is no question that the video game fad is reaching its 
peak says valentine but he acknowledged i underestimated 
the strength and duration of the video game fad in the past

instead of just zapping aliens from outer space 
or punching out a boxing opponent nintendo users of the future may 
be able to trade stocks make vacation plans or shop from home 
the fact remains that the good old nintendo entertainment 
system is a fullblown 8bit computer system that can do a lot more 
than play super mario brothers 2 says peter t main vice 
president of marketing at nintendo of america inc in redmond wash 
although he wouldnt disclose details of the companys plans he 
said the popularity of the video game system presents significant 
opportunities for a home information system 
nintendo previously has disclosed talks with american telephone 
amp telegraph co but both indicate the negotiations are in 
preliminary stages 
presumably the companies are talking about creating an 
interactive communications network that would involve hooking 
nintendo machines to phone lines to receive and send information 
not only would the linkup allow people to play video games with 
others around the country it eventually could give nintendo 
machine owners access to data supplied by a third party 
nintendo has experience in computer networking in 1987 it was 
host of a family computer golf tournament in japan as an 
experiment in communications using public phone lines 
video golf players across japan vied against each other while 
using the family computer system the machine is in 35 percent of 
households there where nintendo says it has a 90 percent share of 
the home video game market nintendo expects to be in 21 percent of 
us households by the end of 1989 
last year in japan nintendo started the family computer 
communications network system through a joint venture with nomura 
securities co ltd the system provides securities information and 
trading services 
nintendo co ltd of japan parent of the us subsidiary laid 
out its goals for information services in its 1988 financial report 
in it president hiroshi yamauchi said we firmly believe that 
the development of an information system that is easily accessible 
to virtually anybody easytouse and provides even minimal 
amounts of valuable data will be successful 
based upon this firm belief we will continue our efforts to 
develop and foster this new information market in japan and 
eventually as consumer interest evolves in the usa 
nintendo officials delivered the same pitch to wall street 
securities analysts earlier this summer the company was trying to 
attract interest to the first sale of nintendos american 
depositary receipts adrs allow usbased investors to hold stocks 
of foreign companies 
analysts say nintendo is trying to promote its image as a 
consumer electronics company not just a toymaker 
being primarily a toy company selling a simple electronic device 
was probably to nintendos advantage in entering homes consumers 
who may have had no interest in personal computers actually own one 
disguised as a game machine 
nintendos strategy has caused big computer companies to take 
notice 
the move by nec corp into video games was motivated partly by a 
desire to establish a pesence in homes the game machine 
turbografx16 is being introduced in the united states this autumn 
by the giant japanese computer and communications company 
were in this business because it does a couple of things that 
are important strategically says ken wirt assistant vice 
president of nec home electronics usa inc necs american 
subsidiary 
the turbografx is a computer and it is in the home we believe 
that the home market is very important for nec says wirt its 
very possible to put the kind of technology in the home that can 
form the basis of future uses for the product 
both nec and nintendo seem to be pursuing a 
getthemwhiletheiryoung approach to gaining customers after 
youngsters get hooked on video games it may be easier to reel them 
in as personal computer buyers when they grow up 
as wirt of nec puts it children will associate nec with 
hightech highquality products and they are the future consumers 
of home electronics

turned over to british law enforcement banking and securities 
regulatory bodies to investigate possible disclosure violations 
natwest chairman lord boardman 70 accepted responsibility for 
the banks serious failings natwest said in a statement 
boardman was not cited by the department of trade and industry

this allows the customer to focus on their core business the 
things theyre particularly good at and allows us to focus on the 
things were particularly good at said david e mcdowell the 
president of ibms national service division 
ibm will build and run a data center at kodaks rochester ny 
headquarters that will take over dataprocessing work now spread 
out over three centers in rochester and one in windsor colo 
the budget of the operations involved is a significant portion 
although far less than half of kodaks annual worldwide budget 
of 500 million for computing said katherine m hudson kodaks 
director of corporate information systems 
kodak hopes the contract will save it close to half of what it 
has been spending on the operations that are being taken over she 
said neither company would disclose terms of their contract 
kodak chairman colby chandler said monday the company would take 
a 225 million charge against secondquarter earnings for costs of 
consolidating photofinishing and consumer photography operations 
and said he was very disappointed with operating results the 
computer deal appears to be a step toward solving those problems 
ibm has been working to become a partner with its customers 
embedding itself deeply in their businesses it won the kodak job 
in competition with electronic data systems a subsidiary of 
general motors corp 
the deal with kodak although not highly profitable is the 
kind of business ibm would like to do more of said stephen 
cohen a gartner group analyst in stamford conn 
it took ibm maybe 10 years to bring this to this level said 
sonny monosson a computer industry watcher in boston 
the contract with ibm may eventually be expanded to include 
foreign data centers as well as data centers of kodaks recently 
acquired sterling drug subsidiary and other us operations ms 
hudson said 
excluded will be personal computers and networks which will be 
supplied and serviced under a recently announced contract with 
businessland inc also excluded will be specialty computers such 
as factoryfloor models most of which are made by ibm rival 
digital equipment corp 
ibms and kodaks businesses overlap in some areas such as 
image storage and retrieval but mcdowell said the companies see 
themselves as partners not rivals 
the new data center in rochester which ibm will design build 
and staff will be a showcase for the latest in ibm and kodak 
technology it will take about two years to finish but ibm will 
take over dataprocessing responsibilities sooner this oct 2 
slightly less than 300 kodak dataprocessing employees will 
become employees of ibm 
kodak uses computers from companies other than ibm and that 
will continue under ibm management mcdowell said we dont have 
a particularly strong vendor bias when it comes to solving a 
customers operational problem he said 
still cohen of gartner group said the deal would give ibm a 
firmer lock on the kodak account i dont think amdahl is going 
to stand much of a chance of selling a mainframe to ibm he said

salomon inc said tuesday that its 
secondquarter profit more than tripled to record levels while 
shearson lehman hutton holdings inc reported a 43 percent jump in 
earnings 
both brokerage companies said they benefited largely from a 
sharp pickup of activity on wall street during the spring months 
salomons profit soared to 253 million or 189 a share in 
the three months ended june 30 from 80 million or 49 cents a 
share in the 1988 quarter 
the results shattered the previous record profit of 190 million 
in the first quarter of 1986 and were more than three times as high 
as the 1988 secondquarter earnings of 80 million or 49 cents a 
share secondquarter revenue totaled 232 billion up from 142 
billion 
for the first half of this year however salomons earnings 
fell slightly to 225 million or 154 a share from 253 million 
or 168 in 1988 
shearsons quarterly net income totaled 55 million or 54 cents 
a share compared with earnings of 39 million or 37 cents a 
share in 1988 revenue rose 31 percent to 33 billion from 25 
billion 
but for the first six months shearson netted 40 million or 31 
cents a share on revenue of 63 billion that was down 65 percent 
from earnings of 113 million or 114 a share and 5 billion in 
revenue last year 
salomon said its strong earnings reflected the industrywide 
improvement in volume in the us bond and equity markets as 
well as profits across most product lines 
the securities segment alone contributed 390 million to 
secondquarter consolidated pretax earnings of 453 million the 
company said 
among other segments phibro energys pretax earnings wre 102 
million compared with 30 million in the 1988 quarter 
crude oil trading was especially strong benefiting from both 
higher prices and volatility the company said in a statement 
refining results were also firm 
shearson a subsidiary of american express co said a pickup in 
investor activity as well as continued costcutting efforts were 
responsible for the sharp rise in secondquarter income 
during the period shearson also strengthened its capital base 
through the sale of the boston cos mutual fund transfer agency 
which added 200 million to shareholders equity last years 
secondquarter results included 69 million of pretax expenses 
associated with the merger of ef hutton inc

kaiser permanente the nations largest 
health maintenance organization will undertake a 36 billion 
expansion in northern california the next ten years officials said 
tuesday 
the expansion which will result in higher membership dues 
includes major renovations of hospitals in the san francisco area 
kaiser permanente which serves23 million members in northern 
california grew at an unprecedented rate in 1988 and must expand 
to keep up with projected growth said dr david lawrence senior 
vice president and regional manager 
lawrence said annual membership rates probably would go up 15 
percent in 1990 but he said kaiser should be able to maintain its 
position as the least expensive hmo in the area 
under the expansion plan kaiser will invest 165 billion in 
the san francisco bay area and 907 million in the sacramentosan 
joaquin valley area as well as nearly 1 billion throughout the 
region 
membership growth had averaged about 3 percent annually but 
soared to 6 percent in 1988 administrators expect about 125000 
new members in 1989 also a 6 percent increase 
lawrence attributed membership growth to growing population the 
failure of competing hmos and what he called kaisers affordable 
rates

net income of 802 million or 12 cents a share on revenue of 74

for the six months ending june 30 the company reported net 
income of 145 million or 21 cents a share on revenue of 1387 
million for the same period last year blockbuster reported net 
income of 604 or 10 cents a share on revenue of 565 million

vegasbased major video corp in january the company had a 2for1

corporate executives contemplating mergers have 
a stronger arsenal against unwanted buyout bids now that the 
delaware supreme court has upheld time incs right to proceed with 
its buyout of warner communications inc legal scholars said 
tuesday 
coming at the end of a decade dominated by hostile takeovers 
mondays decision forcing paramount communications inc to end its 
hostile 122 billion bid for time provides a measure of calm to 
the boardrooms of delaware corporations said james d cox a law 
professor at duke university 
there was a basically misguided malaise that delaware was 
needlessly and recklessly championing the cause of bidders and not 
providing sufficient deference to incumbent management cox said 
now cox said the idea is companies are allowed to formulate 
business policies such as engaging in a large and costly 
acquisition and to engage in those policies in the face of an offer 
by an outsider 
the ruling monday has broad implications across corporate 
america many of the nations biggest companies like time 
paramount and warner are incorporated in delaware and are subject 
to its laws 
delawares highest court upheld the decision by chancery court 
judge william t allen that the timewarner deal which was 
announced three months before paramount launched its bid in june 
was the result of longterm business planning and neither paramount 
nor time shareholders could interfere 
paramount contended that by agreeing to merge with warner time 
effectively put itself up for sale and should have been forced to 
consider paramounts hostile buyout offer 
the threejudge supreme court announced its ruling from the 
bench and was to issue a written opinion at some point in the 
future 
delawares exact position will be determined by the written 
opinion cox said but the line has been more clearly drawn in 
the sand as a result of the courts decision and in the facts of 
the time case 
i would be mildly surprised if there were any substantial 
changes in the rhetoric or principles from those announced in 
allens decision cox said 
michael bradley a university of michigan law professor agreed 
that the supreme court would rubberstamp allens decision 
which he said came came away with no basic principles changed no 
new trends 
however bradley said allen did limit the ability of hostile 
bidders to attack companies and broadened the power of directors to 
defend against unwanted offers 
after allens decision a merger per se is not viewed as a 
defensive tactic bradley said a merger is seen as an ongoing 
operating strategy of the firm and that does not constitute putting 
the firm on the block 
you can pursue those longrange goals without fear of throwing 
yourself into the ring bradley said 
bernard black a professor at the columbia university school of 
law said the supreme courts support for allens ruling was 
consistent with delawares middleoftheroad approach to takeovers 
bradley said allens ruling follows the business judgment rule 
that delaware has long afforded corporate officers the business 
judgment rule is a legal concept that generally allows decisions 
taken by a board of directors to stand undisturbed if they were 
made in good faith 
delaware courts were criticized in the past year by legal 
experts after decisions that aided successful hostile bids for such 
companies as macmillan inc and pillsbury co 
but black said the states support for the takeover defense 
known as the poison pill and its strong antitakeover statute 
already have given management more muscle in fighting unwanted bids 
put those two together and you have to say the overall balance 
has shifted fairly strongly in favor of targets black said 
noting that more companies are successfully fending off hostile 
bids 
observers expect the delaware courts to deal with cases similar 
to the timeparamount battle again in the future 
for example companies likely will claim an unwanted bid 
interferes with their longrange plans michael klein an attorney 
representing some of times shareholders predicted after mondays 
ruling that lawyers will advise corporations to develop an 
appearance of a longterm plan to ward off potential takeovers 
as companies try to use longterm plans as a shield the 
delaware courts likely will be called upon to decide in each case 
whether such a strategy is a reasonable

million or 111 a share on revenue of 1328 billion that 
compared with earnings of 3222 million or 85 cents a share on 
revenue of 1216 billion during the comparable period last year 
net income for the period included 563 million from 
discontinued operations reflecting a net gain of 549 million 
from the sale of the commercial division of the coldwell banker 
real estate group sears said 
that sale was part of a restructuring plan that also includes 
the planned sale of the 110story sears tower and the relocation of 
the merchandise group to suburban hoffman estates from downtown 
chicago 
last years second quarter included a 161 million loss from 
discontinued operations 
sears flagship merchandise group which accounts for the bulk of 
the companys profit and revenue reported second quarter income 
rose 25 percent to 1616 million on a 7 percent increase in 
revenue to 771 billion 
allstate insurance group reported second quarter income of 
1998 million compared to 1906 million a year ago which 
included a 195 million loss from the discontinued lifehealth

dean witter financial services group which includes sears 
discover credit card business reported second quarter income of 
445 million up from 109 million a year ago discover card 
operations resulted in income of 166 million for the period 
compared with 100000 a year ago 
coldwell banker real estate group had income of 464 million 
including the gain from the sale of the commercial division 
compared with 185 million in the same period last year sears 
said 
although there were signs of slowing economic activity in the 
second quarter the factors which most directly affect the consumer 
continue to be positive said edward a brennan sears chairman 
and chief executive officer he said low unemployment modest 
inflation growth and growing real disposal income as some factors 
some retail analysts had predicted sears would show a decrease 
in overall earnings due to the initial costs associated with its 
restructuring 
john landschultz of cowen amp co in chicago said i think that 
the retailing operation did better than expected given the 
restructuring 
sears has been in the middle of change very rapid internal 
change and that generally adds to costs landschultz said so 
i think thatsome of the benefits are starting to come in from 
the restructuring 
the earnings report indicates that they are making progress 
toward the costcutting goal said monroe greenstein an analyst 
with bear stearns amp co in new york 
greenstein also said the improved figures were better than 
expected 
sears announced the restructuring plan last fall designed to 
enhance its stock price and focus the retailers resources on 
consumeroriented businesses 
the sale of the sears tower is still being negotiated but 
fairweather did not provide details 
the plan also includes everyday low pricing at its 825 
retail stores instead of special sale days

sales of domestically made cars and trucks rose 
24 percent in midjuly despite a sizable decline in chrysler 
corps car sales the nations automakers reported tuesday 
the data indicated that the auto industry may be settling at a 
lower overall sales level than in 1988 but that a decline so far 
this year may have ended 
the eight major automakers based in the united states said they 
sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 39726 during the 
july 1120 period this year compared with a rate of 38807 during 
the same period last year 
a 38 percent gain in truck sales was slowed by a 15 percent 
increase in car sales 
the industry has settled in at a lower level here than 88 on 
average said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co of new 
york its stopped falling off the cliff its stopped its free 
fall 
the results came despite an 185 percent decline in chryslers 
car sales merlis said the nations no 3 automaker whose car line 
is weighted toward smaller cars is being stung by a slowdown in 
that segment of the market 
what were seeing here is their exposure to the smaller car 
downturn merlis said 
ford motor cos domestic car sales during the period dropped 
24 percent and general motors corps fell 14 percent truck 
sales by each of the big three helped push up their overall sales 
figures 
fords trucks sold at a 42 percent better clip in midjuly this 
year over last year chryslers were up 41 percent and gms 
increased by 31 percent 
the results said john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co of new 
york are definitely better than we have had in the last several 
months 
through the first 20 days of the month cars and trucks have 
sold at a rate 5 percent above last year sales typically flatten 
in the third quarter as manufacturers shut plants to retool for the 
coming model year which begins every oct 1 and as they sell the 
last of the current model years cars 
this year automakers have offered incentives and there has been 
widespread speculation of price increases for 1990 models both of 
which can fuel sales late in the model year 
kirnan also said some of the sales reported this month may be 
borrowed from later on in the year as consumers take advantage 
of incentives now and avoid price increases later 
im more convinced that the sales numbers that we are seeing 
in the last 20 days in july are probably coming at the expense of 
the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1990 ahead he said 
incentives have been in place for much of this calendar year 
but they have not generated the kind of consumer interest 
automakers desired 
through july 20 of this year car and truck sales were running 
at a rate 4 percent behind last years rate car sales were down 
53 percent and truck sales were off 18 percent 
chryslers car sales so far this year were running 148 percent 
behind last years pace the companys truck sales were up 41 
percent during midjuly this year and down 04 percent for the year 
fords yeartodate car sales were 86 percent lower that last 
year its truck sales were up 31 percent in midjuly and down 24 
percent for the year 
gms car sales for the year were running 86 percent behind the 
1988 pace its truck sales were up 31 percent in midjuly and down 
24 percent for the year

supercomputer leader cray research inc on 
tuesday lowered revenue projections for the year and reported a 75 
percent drop in secondquarter earnings 
the company posted profits of 44 million or 15 cents a share 
compared with 191 million or 61 cents a share in the second 
quarter of 1988 sales fell about 4 percent to 1282 million from 
1343 million 
president marcelo a gumucio had predicted 10 percent growth in 
revenues for 1989 but on tuesday he said sales for the year are 
likely to remain flat crays 1988 sales were 7563 million 
while we continue to expect a very strong performance in the 
second half of the year our most realistic outlook now is to 
maintain revenues for the full year in line with 1988 gumucio 
said with this revised revenue outlook our earnings will 
continue to be under pressure 
cray stock closed tuesday at 4412 cents a share down 75 
cents a share 
gumucio said contract signings have been delayed because of 
competitive and economic conditions he also said there has 
been a shift in product mix to more used systems and less new 
systems 
crays earnings for the first six months were 59 million or 
20 cents a share compared with 455 million or 146 a share 
for the same period a year ago sales dropped to 2443 million 
from 2802 million 
we have been successfully controlling expenses and will 
continue to do so gumucio said it is not likely however 
that expense control will offset other factors 
gumucio said those factors include a reduction in profit margins 
due to a higher amount of tradein allowances and the retirement of 
older returned systems also a problem are substantial 
increases in engineering and development expense related to the 
cray3 project a developing line of supercomputers designed by 
founder seymour cray gumucio said 
crays project will be spun off into a separate company but the 
change wont occur for several months gumucio said in the first 
six months of 1989 the cray3 project cost about 20 million

strikebound eastern airlines said tuesday it will 
fall short of its originally announced flight schedule for aug 1 
but will be on track by aug 15 
we made those projections four or five months ago the fact 
that youre off on the target date by two weeks is not going to 
cause anybody concern eastern spokesman robin matell said 
eastern which struggled to fly 100 flights daily in the first 
weeks after its three unions struck march 4 said it will increase 
a july schedule of 225 daily flights to 350 on aug 1 and to 390 
flights on aug 15 eastern has said it can rebuild without the 
unions and plans by years end to build up to 800 flights compared 
to nearly 1100 daily before the strike 
the company also announced leasing of five planes and crews from 
its texas air corp sister carrier continental airlines to help 
with the august schedule 
the company announcement says what weve said all along they 
dont have the pilots to meet their aug 1 schedule pilots union 
spokesman hank weber said 
most of easterns creditors have expressed approval of the 
companys rebuilding plans the unions are backing a buyout bid by 
chicago options trader joseph ritchie 
weber said his union would challenge the use of continental 
flight crews as a violation of its pilots union contract he also 
said renting planes and crews from continental was another example 
of upstreaming eastern cash to the parent texas air 
eastern also gave figures tuesday saying it was well ahead of 
projections on passenger boardings and seat miles flown matell 
said eastern is flying at more than 80 percent capacity 
one thing they fail to say is theyre making money weber 
said saying eastern may be luring passengers with such fares as 
39 one way between atlanta and several cities but is losing money 
the pilots remain skeptical that eastern can reach its 
rebuilding goals he said 
admittedly we were off target by two weeks matell said 
blaming minor bottlenecks that developed in the training and 
saying a minor adjustment was to be expected with such a schedule 
boost 
eastern is giving full assurances to travel agents and 
passengers that it will meet its aug 15 schedule matell said he 
didnt have details on which flights were being delayed from aug 1 
to aug 15 
he said no other airline has attempted to rebuild the way 
eastern has with such a large number of new pilots 
frank causey eastern vice president for flight operations said 
325 veteran eastern pilots have crossed union picket lines 260 
pilot recruits have completed training and 680 recruits are still 
in training eastern said 107 of the recruits enrolled this week 
and that there were 19 pilot crossovers monday 
only about 200 of the 3600 air line pilots association pilots 
crossed picket lines at the strikes beginning

folks who want the latest stayintouch device 
soon can get a wrist beeper that brings hightech communications 
one step closer to the ultimate dick tracys twoway wrist 
tvradio 
actually motorola inc was thinking more of james bond than 
dick tracy when it developed its wrist watch pager with timex 
corp spokeswoman pat schod said tuesday from the companys 
suburban schaumburg headquarters 
weve been developing this for a long time ms schod said 
of the device which combines a telephone numberdisplay pager with 
a digital watch 
tracy has been relying on his futuristic marvel as he stalks 
such underworld unworthies as pruneface and bb eyes since the 
hatchetnosed steelyeyed comicstrip cop began pounding his beat 
in 1931 
still the wrist pager will be available soon motorola says 
while most experts dont expect dick tracys twoway tvradio to 
hit the market before the 21st century 
motorolas wrist pager is expected to go on the market in the 
first half of 1990 from the companys roboticsassembly plant at 
boynton beach fla ms schod said 
she said she did not know how much it woudl cost although the 
device likely will be marketed in the threefigure price range 
the black pager looks like a sports watch and weighs less 
than two ounces about the same as a regular watch ms schod said 
it operates for more than 40 days on one battery 
as with other types of paging devices a caller dials the number 
assigned to the pager and gets a beeping tone at which point the 
caller enters his telephone number a beep alerts the wearer to the 
calls 
the wrist pager can store up to eight numbers from incoming 
callers along with the time the calls came in and shows the 
numbers on its liquid crystal display watch face at the touch of a 
button 
there are other compact pagers on the market motorola offers 
one beeper about the size of a pen but this would be the first in 
the convenient wrist watch form ms schod said 
the device combines the knowhow of middlebury connbased 
timex maker of the nations bestselling watches and motorola 
one of the worlds leading manufacturers of electronic equipment 
systems and components such as twoway radios cellular telephones 
and systems and data communications and information processing and 
handling equipment 
motorola handed the electrical design for merging the two 
functions while timex which plans to offer a similar product in 
two years focused on the timepiece the companies worked together 
on the pagers design and function

fleet prices for 1990model ford and chrysler 
cars will increase as much as 9 percent a possible sign of things 
to come at showrooms 
if the fleet increases are carried over to the retail market as 
automakers may decide to do later this year incentives could take 
the edge off the higher prices for consumers 
ford motor co and chrysler corp on monday released their fleet 
prices the amount automakers charge their largest customers who 
order cars by a certain date general motors corp has not released 
its fleet prices 
if retail prices eventually are set lower fleet customers get a 
rebate 
automakers have said in the past that yeartoyear price 
increases have resulted from the addition of more standard 
equipment for the 1990 model year the big three will equip all or 
part of their fleets with driverside air bags 
ford has estimated the device will add 350 to 700 to the price 
of a new car it expects to install 1 million air bags during the 
1990 model year 
chrysler which is equipping its millioncar fleet with air 
bags said its fleet price will increase an average of 500 a car 
gm president robert stempel said last week that air bags would 
boost the price of a car by at least 500 and a replacement air 
bag would cost consumers about 1000 about 500000 gm cars will 
have the air bags as standard equipment 
last year retail car prices went up 2 percent to 3 percent 
part of the increase for 1990 models probably will be offset by 
continued cash incentives which now range from a few hundred 
dollars to 4000 per car on nearly all automobiles made by the big 
three and some overseas companies

house investigators said tuesday their probe 
of internal revenue service involvement in eight cases starting 
with a dispute between jeans makers uncovered widespread 
wrongdoing by the criminal divison of the nations tax agency 
investigators leonard bernard and richard stana said the 
washington headquarters of the service showed a serious failure 
to effectively manage employee integrity programs 
our investigation revealed for example that on a number of 
occasions irs national office officials at the highest levels 
ignored instances of wrongdoing by senior managers in washington 
dc and elsewhere stana told the house government operations 
subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs for whom 
he and bernard worked 
additionally underlings at the agency feared retaliation if 
they blew the whistle on their superiors said the investigators 
if improvements are needed we are interested in making the 
improvements said ellen murphy director of public affairs for 
the irs we and the subcommittee are headed in the same 
direction 
the investigators testimony opened three days of hearings by 
the subcommittee irs officials were to testify wednesday and 
thursday 
bernard and stana said at the outset that the vast majority of 
irs employees including senior officials understand the 
importance of high ethical standards they admitted that their 
probe was limited to a small fraction of the activities of the 
criminal investigative division 
however they said the abuses we found underscore the 
lack of intensive management review and internal auditing of cid 
programs and operations 
as the two investigators described it the fight between the 
jordache and guess jeans companies was a tale of limousines 
parties and promises of highly paid jobs revolving around the 
former chief of the divisions los angeles office ronald saranow 
what our investigation disclosed was a powerful criminal 
investigation chief who together with a cadre of loyal 
subordinates was beyond the control of his regional commissioner 
and the irs commissioner in washington they investigators said 
the subcommittees eight cases included two others involving 
saranow and five others involving some senior officials from all 
seven irs regions including an unidentified official who allegedly 
used an irs undercover boat for a fourth of july beer party 
improperly paid for with government funds 
in all more than 200 interviews were conducted and over 25000 
documents examined said the investigators 
murphy said the irs would have no comment about specific cases 
because of privacy laws coverning taxes 
stana said saranow was approached in 1985 by the originators and 
50 percent owners of guess jeans the marciano brothers of los 
angeles paul george armand and maurice with information the 
marcianos said revealed tax fraud by their business partners 
the partners were the nakash brothers of new york joe ralph 
and avi owners of jordache enterprises the nakash brothers had 
bought 50 percent of guess from the marcianos in 1983 
when the marcianos took their allegations to the irs they were 
involved in heated litigation with the nakashes to get back that 50 
percent 
the subcommittee investigators said the marcianos information 
was of dubious value and questionable quality and never 
properly evaluated but saranow pursued an aggressive twoyear 
investigation of the nakashes anyway though never turning up a 
criminal violation 
we believe the evidence demonstrates that the marcianos 
exercised unusual influence over ronald saranow by cultivating a 
strong personal and social relationship with him and by offering 
him a sixfigure salary said stana and bernard 
the marcianos deny ever offering jobs to saranow 
saranow eventually retired from the irs and never took a job 
with guess 
the subcommittee investigators said irs headquarters officials 
entrusted an investigation of saranow to a woman well known to have 
a close personal relationship with him 
russell davis an irs inspector told bernard and stana he was 
being pressured to close down the entire matter 
davis said he didnt think there would have been any internal 
investigation at all if it had not been for an article about 
saranows relationship with the marcianos in the november 1987 
edition of forbes magazine which stana called disturbing

mobil corp said tuesday its secondquarter profit fell 23 
percent after a 140 million loss from the sale of its south 
african operations 
chevron corps earnings also declined while phillips petroleum 
co and sun co said their net income improved 
the companies reported that higher crude and gasoline prices and 
a strong dollar affected the latest quarters earnings 
for the threemonth period ended june 30 mobils earnings were 
401 million or 98 cents a share down from 519 million or 126 
a share in the comparable 1988 quarter revenue was nearly flat at 
14 billion compared with 1395 billion at the same time last 
year 
excluding the 140 million loss stemming from its previously 
announced pullout from south africa new yorkbased mobil said is 
earnings would have totaled 541 million 4 percent higher than the 
same 1988 quarter 
chevron earnings were 404 million or 118 a share down 22 
percent from 520 million or 152 a share in the 1988 second 
quarter the san franciscobased company had 82 billion in 
revenue a 12 percent rise from 73 billion in the yearago period 
chevron said its quarterly profit improved 11 percent after 
adjusting both periods for special items and foreign exchange 
effects these reduced earnings by 10 million in the current 
period while benefiting results in last years second quarter by 
148 million 
phillips petroleum said its earnings benefited from higher crude 
oil prices rising to 197 million or 81 cents a share from 170 
million or 72 cents a share sales for the bartlesville 
oklabased company totaled 33 billion from 29 billion in the 
1988 quarter a gain of 145 percent 
sun cos net income climbed to 105 million or 98 cents a 
share from a net loss of 201 million or 190 a share in the 
second quarter of 1988 included in the last years results were 
special charges of 297 million after taxes associated with its 
domestic exploration and production division which sun spun off to 
shareholders nov 1 
excluding these special charges the latest results would have 
been up by 9 million or 9 percent said the company based in 
radnor pa revenue totaled 292 billion up 20 percent from 243 
billion a year ago 
higher crude prices helped oil companies exploration and 
production businesses but cut into refining and marketing profits 
in some cases the higher cost of crude oil to refiners was offset 
by a sharp hike in gasoline prices at the pump 
mobil announced april 28 that it was leaving south africa after 
90 years of doing business there the oil giant said it sold 
operations once valued at more than 400 million for about 165 
million including a refinery and commercial petroleum marketing 
networks and 12 mobil affiliates in south africa namibia 
botswana swaziland and lesotho 
mobil the secondlargest us oil concern behind exxon corp 
was pressured to leave the racially divided nation because of 
recent laws making it more difficult for us companies to make 
profits from operating in south africa as well as legislation now 
under consideration in congress calling for a ban on us 
operations there 
for the first six months of 1989 mobils profit totaled 830 
million or 202 a share down 22 percent from 11 billion or 
259 a share in the 1988 period the companys revenue edged up 
to 28 billion from 279 billion 
excluding the south african loss firsthalf profit would have 
amounted to 970 million down 9 percent from 1988 
mobils earnings benefited from higher crude and foreign natural 
gas prices as well as reduced financing expenses improved us 
refining margins and higher chemical income which included gains 
from asset sales 
chevron said its firsthalf earnings fell 39 percent to 717 
million or 209 a share from 12 billion or 343 a share in 
the first half of last year last years earnings included a net 
gain of 387 million from foreign exchange and asset sales while 
the current quarter benefit from these items totaled 12 million 
revenue in the first half totaled 159 billion up from 148 
billion in the yearearlier period 
phillips said its net income in the first half was 387 million 
or 159 a share up 29 percent from 300 million or 127 a 
share in the 1988 half revenue rose to 64 billion vs 58 
billion a year ago 
the company said it benefited from higher crude prices which 
contributed to sharp gains in its exploration and production 
businesses as well as increased natural gas revenue gains from 
higher gasoline prices were offset by higher costs of crude oil 
the company said 
for the first half sun earned 186 million or 174 a share 
compared with a loss of 141 million in the 1988 period revenue 
totaled 56 billion up 15 percent from 48 billion 
sun said improved earnings in its real estate subsidiary 
contributed to the quarters results but were partially offset by 
declines in domestic operations due in part to a tax adjustment 
that boosted earnings in last years second quarter

the federal communications commission said 
tuesday it fined usair inc for deliberately jamming radio 
communications of eastern airlines flights at philadelphia 
international airport 
wayne t mckee an attorney in the commissions enforcement 
division said usair and jetstream international airlines had been 
fined 2000 each for three incidents related to the lengthy strike 
at eastern 
he said the disruptions were potentially very dangerous and have 
occurred while plane crews talked by radio with control tower 
personnel during taxiing takeoffs and landings 
its traffic mainly on the ground sometimes landing and 
taking off thats really what creates the safety problem mckee 
said he said the interruptions were sporadic but now seemed to 
have escalated thats one reason why we decided to quit taking 
evidence and take some actions it went from some brief 
transmissions to actual jamming 
some of the content of the communications indicates its 
related to the eastern strike mckee said 
eastern machinists struck the airline on march 4 and many 
eastern pilots have refused to cross picket lines 
but mckee said eastern still has been operating at least two 
flights a day out of the philadelphia airport 
the federal aviation administration and the fbi also are 
investigating the radio disruptions and the fcc is discussing 
possible criminal prosecutions with the us attorneys office 
mckee said 
criminal penalties of up to 250000 in fines and 10 years in 
jail are possible for conviction of interfering with airport 
communications 
similar incidents involving eastern jets have occurred in 
atlanta and new york city mckee said 
he said he did not think anyone had been singled out for blame 
yet but that under faa rules pilots are responsible for whatever 
happens on their planes 
usair spokesman john bronson said from pittsburgh we are 
investigating the matter internally and i cant elaborate 
the commission levied the maximum fines 2000 against both 
usair of crystal city va and jetstream of dayton ohio on 
monday for three incidents mckee said 
a usair plane was involved in one incident of deliberate jamming 
of radio communications between an eastern jet and the airport 
control tower while another usair plane and a jetstream aircraft 
were involved in separate incidents of prohibited superfluous 
transmissions 
he said the interference occurs when someone deliberately leaves 
a microphone open knocking out communications in planes nearby 
the plane cant hear the tower over the jamming he said 
at the request of the faa the fcc deployed direction finders to 
identify the aircraft involved their transmissions were recorded 
and their transmitters will leave a unique electronic fingerprint 
for later identification
