after 9 months as prime minister 
benazir bhutto sees herself as a crusader to save pakistan from the 
clutches of drugs ethnic violence and rancorous politics 
i see things in terms of knights in shining armor trying to 
root out evil ms bhutto said in an interview with the associated 
press 
that may be a sort of simplistic way to put it but i am an 
optimist i have great dreams for my country and i want to achieve 
them 
but she acknowledged her vision might be a bit fanciful 
i think i am too much of an idealist 
educated at harvard and englands oxford university the 
36yearold ms bhutto is the first woman to lead a moslem nation 
and as she spoke she had a scarf called a dupatta draped over 
her shoulder when in public she wears the scarf over her head the 
custom of moslem women as a concession to pakistans religious 
right wing a powerful minority that opposes female rule 
ms bhutto and her leftleaning pakistan peoples party govern a 
restless nation of 107 million people burdened by poverty 
illiteracy and civil war across the border in afghanistan 
she said death threats after her government declared war on the 
heroin trade and drug barons have forced her to think of her safety 
something she has resisted since assuming office dec 2 
i dont believe in a life that is crowded with security she 
said i think its kind of nice to be able to slip away after 
having worked hard for a few days to be able to go for a half an 
hour walk 
i just consider it important for a person in public life to try 
and maintain a sense of normalacy to have their feet on the 
ground 
as for the drug war she said we are really now just going 
after the big people but its a much bigger problem its just 
proliferated all over the country like a cancer 
western countries estimate that up to 80 percent of the heroin 
arriving in the united states and europe comes from pakistan drug 
addiction in pakistan has soared from near zero in 1979 to an 
estimated 1 million addicts in 1989 
ms bhutto is also doing battle with an opposition made up of 
islamic fundamentalists conservatives and loyalists of the late 
president gen mohammad zia ulhaq and his military government 
zia overthrew her father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in 
a 1977 coup and had him hanged two years later for his alleged 
complicity in a murder plot 
zia many of his top generals and us ambassador arnold l 
raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in august 1988 clearing the 
way for pakistans first free elections in more than a decade and 
resulting in mrs bhuttos election nov 16 
ms bhutto says the most serious threat to her government is 
ethnic hundreds of pakistanis have died and thousands have been 
injured since 1986 in violence in her southern home province of 
sindh in fighting among militant secessionists indian moslem 
immigrants and internal migrants from poorer provinces 
during general zias time ethnic groups became very strong 
she said they set up armed camps and they trained their people 
so its a situation of almost a minikind of a guerrilla war its 
not a guerrilla war against the government but its almost a state 
of anarchy and a rebellion against authority 
ms bhutto claims that her rightwing political opposition the 
nineparty islamic democratic alliance has had a hand in the sindh 
violence 
she also has implicated neighboring india in the sindh troubles 
india and pakistan have fought three wars since they became 
independent from britain in 1947 and they routinely accuse each 
other of fueling their internal problems 
to the west ms bhutto inherited pakistans sponsorship of 
moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the sovietbacked government of 
afghanistan 
more than 3 million afghan war refugees huddle in camps dotting 
pakistans western frontier 
pakistan cant afford to keep the refugees she said but 
are the refugees going to go back without political stability 
so far we have not seen any message or any method that would 
enable the emergence of an independent afghanistan or the return of 
the afghan refugees those remain our goals 
she also said her political opposition is doomed because of its 
links to the zia era when pakistan was under martial law and 
political parties were barred from elections 
pakistan just cant afford a return to the decade of 
repression she said all those who are patriots in the 
different sectors of life whether it is civilian or military 
recognize that therefore i see no imminent threat to democracy in 
pakistan 
but she added that law and order cannot survive without economic 
development in a country where the average yearly wage is under 400 
first youve got to try and create a system create a rule of 
law which gives security and side by side youve got to have 
economic improvement and opportunitiees so people can give better 
meaning to their lives she said

as a girl elizabeth von trapp ran through 
the hills near her home singing songs from the sound of music 
it wasnt so much theatrics though as family tradition 
now she will fill another family role by stepping onto a stage to 
portray her grandmother maria von trapp whose flight from 
nazioccupied austria inspired the musical 
elizabeth von trapp makes her debut as maria in a local theater 
production of the story made famous by the 1965 movie in which julie 
andrews portrayed maria von trapp the matriarch of the family who 
died two years ago at age 82 
i grew up listening to the album with my cousins and wed all 
take parts said elizabeth 35 who learned the tale of the 
familys flight on her grandmothers knee we used the fields to 
practice in 
trapp who has sung professionally at the trapp family lodge in 
stowe for three years also shares the local stage with her 
8yearold cousin kiersten von trapp cast as another of marias 
children 
ive seen the movie five zillion times said kiersten 
squirming impatiently during rehearsal and tugging at her hotpink 
tshirt and miniskirt until i was 7 i thought it was just about 
nuns 
music which first brought maria baron georg von trapp and his 
10 children together as a family during the war continues to be a 
shared bond between the younger von trapp generation as does the 
family legacy 
six of marias children remain in vermont where the family moved 
after the escape and their subsequent worldwide tours as the trapp 
family singers with two others buried in stowe and two living in 
other states 
elizabeth said the youngsters would gather around her father 
werner von trapp one of the children who fled austria a half 
century ago and learn folk songs 
acting is a whole new challenge said elizabeth standing 
before a handpainted set of the austrian mountains in the hyde park 
opera house i am so excited i think my grandmother was that way 
she was excited about life she wasnt discouraged about the 
problems she encountered 
today elizabeth records her own folk songs and designs austrian 
clothing for sale at the lodge gift shop she designed some of the 
costumes for the local production which premieres at the end of the 
month 
being a von trapp people are so in awe of you and they treat 
you differently she said when you grow up with it you live 
with that everyday people say so you are one of the von trapps 
everyone remembers our story its universal ive met people 
at the lodge who went through the same thing but we had a story 
written about it she added 
elizabeth likened the current flood of refugees from east germany 
into austria to her familys situation years ago 
its happening right now although the direction people are 
going has changed she said isnt it ironic that here i am in 
little vermont playing the part and yet the exact same thing is 
happening there 
maria von trapp attended the hyde park annual performance six 
years ago to watch elizabeth perform a bitpart as a nun after the 
performance the baroness took a bow for the crowd and drew a 
standing ovation 
elizabeth remembers that her grandmother who gave up her plans 
to become a nun to marry the baron always wore a silver cross on a 
chain around her neck and until her final years dressed in austrian 
costume 
there was a charm about her that i really appreciated she had 
a great sense of humor and a great way of telling stories shed 
have us rolling on the floor 
everybody is interested in the von trapps they are news 
said the plays director steven hall people visit the lodge and 
then come back year after year to see the show 
elizabeth said her performance as maria adds a new twist to the 
story however 
some of my family members might say its just rehashing the 
story but im experiencing new people and challenges thats what 
arts all about

cracks are opening in the warsaw pact as 
hungarys communist leadership abandons agreements with its military 
allies in the east in pursuit of new friends and business ties in 
the west 
hungary along with poland is in the front rank of reform in the 
soviet bloc eclipsing soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs more 
modest campaigns 
where the soviets have adjusted their communistdominated system 
to introduce a measure of democracy and personal freedom hungarys 
communist leadership has pledged to allow free elections by next 
june that could end the partys 43yearold hold on power 
poland this week installed the east blocs first government not 
led by communists 
where the soviets favor reducing central control of industries 
sentiment in hungary has swung to scrapping all state interference 
in the economy in favor of market forces 
this week hungary enraged communist hardliner east germany by 
allowing thousands of east germans to cross its border to the west 
hungarian officials have been candid about the risks of the 
countrys shift 
there is a danger of hungary becoming isolated in eastern 
europe as some of the things hungary is doing irritate our neighbors 
and allies foreign minister gyula horn told hungarian radio aug 
29 altering our approach however would mean curtailing our 
freedom of action 
an unprecedented plan announced sept 8 to cooperate with neutral 
austria and nonaligned yugoslavia in setting up demilitarized zones 
along common borders is perhaps the clearest sign of a cautious move 
away from the warsaw pact 
hungarys aspirations extend even farther westward with leaders 
knocking on the doors of the 12nation european economic community 
the worlds largest trading bloc 
hungary already has privileges with the eec unique within the 
soviet bloc it signed a 10year agreement with the eec in june 1988 
granting it reduced tariffs on its exports to eec nations the 
accord is the most liberal the eec has signed with a soviet bloc 
country 
hungarian leaders used the recent east german refugee standoff to 
press their case with west germany for a political voice in the bloc 
west germany did not go public with a promise to support those 
wishes but chancellor helmut kohl subsequently said his country 
will give full backing to hungarys economic reforms and 
expectations are that west german gratitude over the east german 
exodus will translate into generous financial aid 
president bush praised hungarian reforms during a july visit and 
congress last week voted to extend by three years instead of the 
customary one year hungarys most favored nation trading status 
which offers the best tariff rates 
hungarys leaders say they have soviet blessings for the 
increasing independence that is moving them closer to the west but 
the reforms are breaking budapest away from some other traditional 
allies 
relations are worst with romania because of disputes over the 
fate of 17 million ethnic hungarians in romania hungary says they 
are being systematically persecuted an accusation romania denies 
tensions exploded after hungary broke an agreement two years ago 
that had committed it to return those fleeing romanias stalinist 
system since then more than 20000 romanians mostly ethnic 
hungarians have found sanctuary in hungary 
relations hit bottom in july after horn hungarys foreign 
minister expressed anxiety that the war of words could escalate to 
violence 
horn referring to romanias boast in april that it could build 
nuclear missiles expressed fears hungary could be a target of such 
weapons one day 
the defense ministry gave up all pretense of fraternal ties 
with the romanian military sept 7 announcing that romanias deputy 
defense minister would not visit as planned 
tensions of a different kind have been building on hungarys 
northern border with czechoslovakia 
because of budgetary and environmental pressures hungary 
abruptly stopped work in may on a joint danube river dam project 
agreed to in 1977 this enraged czechoslovak partners 
the czechoslovaks accused hungary of breaking their word the 
hungarians said the czechosklovaks were planning to violate 
international law by unilaterally diverting a river that forms 
part of the countries common boundary 
growing bitterness over the dam project has been exacerbated by 
political differences 
hungarys leaders used the aug 21 anniversary of the 1968 warsaw 
pact invasion of czechoslovakia to denounce the move which crushed 
a czechoslovak reform movement polish leaders also criticized the 
invasion 
east germany is the latest to join the chorus of east european 
critics of the reformminded hungarians its ire raised by 
budapests decision to open a westward escape route for thousands of 
east germans 
statecontrolled east german media accused hungary of being 
bought by the west germans and the east berlin foreign ministry 
filed a formal protest over the action 
the soviet reaction to change in hungary has ranged from praise 
to tolerance gorbachev has pointed to hungarian economic reforms as 
examples to inspire soviet workers and hungarian electoral reforms 
are reported broadly in staterun soviet media 
but foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov indicated 
kremlin reservations about the refugee exodus describing it as 
unusual

a federal judge has lifted his order that would 
have required energy secretary james watkins to testify on the 
energy departments proposed 78 million settlement with neighbors 
of the nuclear weapons plant at fernald 
however us district judge s arthur spiegel also criticized 
watkins on wednesday as appearing insensitive to the worries of 
people who live near the feed materials production center a uranium 
processing plant 
its no secret that the department of energy has estimated that 
it will cost millions maybe billions to clean up the site 
spiegel said adding that watkins could have reassured to neighbors 
concerned about cleanup costs 
several businesses near the plant say they interpret the 
settlement to mean that they cannot sue to recover from the energy 
department any costs of radioactive materials cleanup on private 
property the energy department agrees with that assessment but 
lawyers for the neighbors disagree 
spiegel first invited then last week ordered watkins to testify 
on that issue saying a final word was needed from the energy 
departments top official but department of justice lawyers opposed 
spiegels request saying it was unnecessary and beyond his 
authority 
justice department lawyer richard stearns said in papers filed 
with spiegel the government would appeal if the judge insisted on 
compelling testimony from watkins a cabinet officer stearns said 
the issue had constitutional implications 
after hearing from both sides wednesday spiegel ruled from the 
bench that he would decide the issue of cleanup costs on the basis 
of the case record and would not require watkins testimony 
spiegel said that to do otherwise would probably prompt a 
timeconsuming government appeal that would further delay a 
resolution for the plants neighbors 
spiegel directed lawyers for the government and neighbors to meet 
and resolve the issue this week 
the 38yearold plant about 18 miles northwest of cincinnti 
processes uranium for use elsewhere in making the governments 
nuclear weapons 
neighbors of the plant filed their classaction suit in 1985 on 
behalf of 14000 people living within five miles of the plant the 
suit contended that radioactive pollution from the plant lowered 
property values and caused them emotional distress the settlement 
was reached june 30 
ruetgers nease chemical co and the mobil corp which have 
operations near the plant argued at a hearing on the settlement 
aug 23 that its terms would prevent them from suing to recover the 
cost of any future environmental cleanup on their properties

near the ural mountains city of chelyabinsk skulls 
pierced by bullet holes were found where gold once was mined 
in kolpashova a siberian village on the ob river excavations 
released a stream of mummified corpses to float down the river 
in the ukrainian city of poltava diggers at a sand quarry 
uncovered a series of trenches full of bones the remains of an 
estimated 5000 people 
this is a country built on bones says oleg golovanov a 
member of a group called memorial that is dedicated to the memory of 
josef stalins victims 
the bones lay undisturbed for decades while the soviet government 
refused to acknowledge the estimated 20 million victims of stalins 
bloody years of terror 
now they are coming back to haunt the country about once a month 
for the past year the official press has reported the unearthing of 
another mass grave as the soviet union reveals the horror of its 
past 
on tuesday soviet television carried another report this one 
about the reburial of 350 skeletons found on a mountain near 
chelyabinsk a correspondent said innocent men women old people 
and even children possibly as many as 300000 were loaded onto 
trucks and shot at night 
the memorial group found the remains buried in a former gold mine 
where authorities wanted to build houses now officials plan to turn 
the area into a memorial the correspondent said 
a reburial ceremony is also planned saturday for the remains of 
540 of stalins victims found at a garbage dump in the ukrainian 
coal center of donetsk 
golovanov coordinates efforts to track down the mass graves for 
memorial the national group lobbying to clear the names of stalins 
enemies of the people as well as help their families and those 
who survived years in labor camps 
he believes there could be as many as 100000 unmarked mass 
graves left as a legacy from the purges repressions and labor camps 
stalin oversaw from the late 1920s until his death in 1953 
press coverage of the graves began last year when a killing field 
was found in the kuropaty forest of byelorussia it escalated with a 
similar discovery in bykovnya in the ukraine 
memorial receives a steady stream of letters with information 
about newly revealed sites and golovanov said he sometimes wonders 
what is your goal in digging them up 
he answers to make sure people know all the evil of the stalin 
years he believes there is a need to restore respect to the dead 
youre walking and theyre lying there under you and not a 
single person knows about their fate he said 
golovanov believes the caches of bones also make a forceful 
statement about the countrys communist rulers 
the people in the government are the same now as they were 
then he said people cant help but see that 
the partys policymaking central committee last month ordered 
local governments to do all they could to redress stalinera wrongs 
including cooperating with groups like memorial mass burial 
places should be recognized as official cemeteries the decree 
said and organs of the police and the kgb should be more involved 
in this work 
but golovanov said revealing and marking the old graves remains 
fraught with conflicts 
the kgb whose predecessor the nkvd carried out much of the 
killing often does not open its files to help find graves and 
identify victims kgb officials say their archives are in such 
terrible shape they arent worth examining 
even after the grave sites are identified some local authorities 
insist on using the land for new housing garages or other projects 
in donetsk the local government had turned the killing field 
over to developers and was reluctant to change its plans the youth 
newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported wednesday eventually 
authorities agreed to turn most of the land into a memorial park 
in poltava the grave site is now a dump 
an unsigned letter to memorial from poltava described how a man 
unearthed the trenches of corpses at a sand quarry in 1968 and was 
ordered by authorities to cover them 
once a year since then ive visited that area since i 
supposed that my father was resting there too he wrote he was 
rehabilitated in 1959 posthumously

emigration from eastern europe is rising 
sharply both from reformminded nations relaxing requirements for 
western departures and from hardline communist nations 
here are the available figures on departures from eastern europe 
and explanations of the procedures in each country 
soviet union since mikhail s gorbachev rose to power in may 
1985 and embarked on a broad reform course the soviet union has let 
increasing numbers of citizens emigrate in 1988 a record 108000 
soviets left for permanent resettlement abroad mostly ethnic 
germans armenians and jews this year authorities expect the figure 
to reach 200000 compared to less than 1000 per year in the early 
1980s soviets must submit to a lengthy and bureaucratic process to 
gain permission to emigrate but refusals are now reported to be 
less than 1 percent of applications 
east germany both legal emigration to west germany and 
unauthorized flight to the west are up dramatically this year as 
east germany witnesses the largest migration westward since the 
berlin wall was built in 1961 west germany expects well over 
100000 east germans to arrive this year both legal immigrants and 
a growing number of escapees fleeing through hungarys newly opened 
borders 
east germans get automatic citizenship in west germany less than 
40000 east germans have been allowed to leave for the west in each 
of the past 28 years with the numbers dipping to below 1000 
annually in the 1960s the recent migration wave stems from 
dissatisfaction among east germans with their leaderships refusal 
to emulate the reforms sweeping hungary poland and the soviet union 
poland since passport laws were revised jan 1 to allow 
virtually any citizen to travel abroad the issue for poles has not 
so much been getting permission to leave as getting visas to get 
into other countries most emigres are ethnic germans resettling in 
west germany or those with close relatives in the united states who 
leave to join them more than 140000 poles of german origin 
emigrated last year and 3500 left for the united states us 
visas will rise to 4500 this year while the exodus to west germany 
has tapered off somewhat though official figures are unavailable 
warsaw reported at the end of last year that during the 1980s more 
than 400000 poles failed to return from trips abroad 
hungary figures are not available for legal emigration from 
hungary prior to liberalized travel codes adopted in january 1988 
but the departures are thought to have been limited to a few hundred 
family reunification cases each year budapest officials have also 
acknowledged that an average of 2500 to 3000 hungarians failed to 
return from authorized trips aboard each year during the 1980s 
accounting for the majority of departures those desiring to leave 
now are awaiting a new emigration law being drafted by the hungarian 
parliament it is expected to result in a system similar to polands 
in which anyone with a sponsor abroad will be allowed to leave 
czechoslovakia the last sizeable wave of emigres from 
czechoslovakia was in 1969 when 110000 fled after the warsaw pact 
invasion the previous year and before the borders were sealed 
czechoslovaks now can get to the west only to join spouses abroad

negotiators for the salvadoran government and 
leftist rebels reached an agreement thursday night on a framework 
for negotiations to end their nearly 10yearold war an observer to 
the talks said 
its clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreement 
that they should be attempting to reach not just a ceasefire but an 
end to hostilities said gregorio rosa chavez the auxiliary 
bishop of el salvador 
a preliminary statement by rosa chavez said the sides had reached 
an accord on how to prepare the meetings and on participation of the 
church in the talks he said substantive themes would be discussed 
at the next meeting the current round of talks began wednesday with 
a twoday schedule but the two sides were still negotiating late 
into the night thursday on a final statement rosa chavez said he 
had the impression the future meetings would be held on a 
monthly basis and that they would include international observers 
he added that the talks would take place inside and outside el 
salvador 
earlier in the day the marxist rebels and usbacked government 
argued about the pace of peace talks to end the war which has taken 
70000 lives 
one rebel leader shafick handal told reporters the governments 
concern for procedural matters was very restrictive 
fighting continued in el salvador despite a unilateral truce 
declared by the guerrillas army spokesmen in san salvador said four 
guerrillas were killed two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded 
a helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched 
in san salvador col orlando zepeda the vice minister of 
defense called the rebel proposal to reorganize and reduce the size 
of the armed forces a thinly disguised attempt to seize power we 
continue to be the object of marxist aggression zepeda said 
government representatives had insisted that procedural issues be 
settled first setting aside discussion of a rebel offer to lay down 
their arms and reorganize as a political party in exchange for 
democratic reforms 
sources for both sides also said they were divided on whether 
some negotiating sessions should take place without the presence of 
observers or roman catholic church mediators 
the guerrillas made the proposal wednesday in their first talks 
with the government in two years 
el salvadors government has not presented a peace plan but the 
fiveman delegation arrived with a proposal calling for two days of 
talks every two months 
rebels leaders said they want a fasterpaced negotiating plan 
both sides say they want to end the war 
salvadoran ambassador sigfrido munes cruz told reporters thursday 
that the rebel proposal shows a new attitude a more realistic 
attitude 
munes is not a member of the government delegation but he said 
he feels optimistic 
the meeting is the first between the rebels and the elected 
republican nationalist alliance government of president alfredo 
cristiani who took office june 1 after elections boycotted by the 
insurgents 
the rebels peace proposal calls for a ceasefire by nov 15 in 
exchange for broad reforms including appointing a new supreme court 
and justice minister and moving up legislative and municipal 
elections scheduled for 1991 
the guerrillas also say a truce is conditional on military 
reorganization including a reduction in the number of troops 
expanded land reform and the prosecution of death squad members 
roberto daubuisson founder of cristianis party has been 
accused of playing a key role in rightist death squads that have 
murdered thousands of leftists suspected leftists and other 
government opponents 
under the final stage of their proposal the guerrillas call for 
constitutional and electoral reforms and us agreement to replace 
military aid to the salvadoran government with economic aid 
el salvador is the largest recipient of us aid in the 
hemisphere 
the rebel plan contains many proposals rejected before but the 
wording this time is much milder and the rebels have dropped a 
longstanding insistence on merging their army with the goverment 
armed forces 
their offer to become a political party also is new 
negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed

jewish settlers in the 
occupied west bank say they are trapped between stonethrowing arabs 
and an indecisive government 
since the palestinian uprising began 21 months ago nails have 
been strewn on their roads and their cars are targets of stones and 
firebombs glass window panes have been replaced with plastic and 
travel is often safest in convoy 
the settlers complain bitterly that the government is torn on how 
to put down the uprising and indeed on the future of the occupied 
land itself the result they say is that the army is not doing 
enough to protect them 
of course i am fearful settler mark barat told visitors to 
this fenced hilltop settlement east of tel aviv if there is 
debate in israel it undercuts us 
barat 40 a computer scientist is among more than 70000 jews 
who have moved to the west bank and gaza strip since the territories 
were captured by israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war 
some are ideological settlers convinced that jews must 
reclaim the biblical land of israel others like barat see 
themselves as part of a front line against a palestinian state 
still others are lured by the promise of free land and subsidized 
mortgages 
settlers have become targets in the uprising since many 
palestinians see them as one more encroachment on arab land almost 
half the 17 million palestinians in the territories are refugees 
whose families fled israel when it was founded in 1948 
the settlers say the army which recently began deploying extra 
troops along highways and stepped up escorts for settler convoys at 
night still needs to do more 
instead of soldiers killing mosquito after mosquito let them 
drain the swamp said kiryat arba lawyer eliyakim haetzni a 
leader of the settlers umbrella group gush emunim or bloc of the 
faithful 
we demand the deportation of 5000 people members of the plo 
establishment stonethrowers and their families to show them that 
stone throwing is not a national sport haetzni said 
arabs must know that they can live here only if we can live 
here 
some jewish settlers have poisoned arab vineyards raided 
villages and fired on suspected stone throwers killing at least 23 
palestinians in the past 21 months 
tensions also have increased because of the governments proposal 
for elections in the territories leading to an interim peace 
solution 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has repeatedly said he will refuse 
to give up any occupied land and his rightwing likud bloc urges 
creation of more jewish communities in the territories 
but the leftleaning labor party partner in the coalition 
cabinet with likud advocates trading land for peace and calls for 
suspending the creation of more settlements if peace talks get under 
way 
the 130 settlements built so far run counter to the usbacked 
landforpeace solution which the palestinians demand 
by far the largest number of settlers live in communities close 
to the pre1967 border some of the settlements deeper in the 
territories have populations of only several hundred people 
meron benvenisti an israeli analyst who has studied development 
in the territories for a decade notes that more than threequarters 
of the settlers live within commuting distance of jerusalem or tel 
aviv 
they have come to see themselves as suburbanites of the major 
cities he said 
benvenisti said the settlements depend heavily on government 
subsidies for survival 
he calculates that the government and the world zionist 
organization have spent 25 billion in the past 20 years building 
the new communities providing basic services like water and roads 
and resettling jewish families 
settlers often live rentfree in mobile homes while they build 
their houses there is no cost for the land mortgages are 
subsidized and fees for sewer and water connections are 
considerably less than in israeli towns 
the goverment plans at least seven new settlements by 1992 but 
budget constraints have forced the focus of late on trying to 
increase the population in existing communities 
the number of new settlers fell to 4500 last year from an 
average of 8000 in previous years apparently because of fears over 
the uprising said michael dekel the prime ministers adviser on 
settlement affairs 
but settlement advocates hope the trend can be reversed dekel 
predicted that the jewish population in the territories would reach 
125000 in five years even if the arab revolt continues people 
have become used to the uprising he said

president bush is doubling food aid to poland 
to 100 million next year to support the process of change 
there but the democratic author of a rival plan calls it a merely a 
stopgap effort 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said bushs plan does not go nearly far enough to help 
poland meet its longterm needs 
bush announced the food aid increase for fiscal 1990 on thursday 
just hours after leahy unveiled his own 25 billion food for 
peace package 
the presidents plan calls for shipments to poland of beef pork 
corn butter butter oil sunflower oil cotton and rice the new 
50 million infusion was in addition to 50 million in food bush 
announced in early august for the new fiscal year that begins oct 1 
it is on top of 84 million in emergency food assistance bush 
ordered for the current fiscal year most of the food shipments will 
come from us surpluses 
poland has been affected by severe food shortages and increasing 
prices 
bush had been under mounting pressure from congress to do more to 
aid polands new solidarityled government not only from democrats 
but from senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
dole called bushs decision thursday a good investment in 
democracy and political reform for poland 
the presidents original proposal was made at a time when 
poland while taking some important steps in political reform still 
had a communistdominated government dole said 
it seemed important to me to signal our intent to do more for a 
democratic government than we had for a communist regime said 
dole who visited poland last month with his wife transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole 
however leahy called bushs plan a welcome but stopgap effort 
that fails to give poland the longterm help it needs to restructure 
its agricultural economy and to sustain the worlds newest 
democracy 
the democrats 25 billion rival program includes forgiveness of 
polands 2 billion agricultural debt 150 million in food 
shipments 100 million in foreign aid and a series of trade 
concessions and other assistance 
bush called his polish food aid package one element of our 
continuing effort working with our allies and others to support 
the process of change that is underway in poland 
the overall 1084 million food package which does not require 
congressional approval is in addition to a 119 million plan of 
economic assistance bush announced in july when he visited poland 
we expect that shipments of the new food assistance will 
arrive in time for the difficult winter months he said in a 
statement he said high prices and food shortages have placed a 
heavy burden on the polish people 
it is intended that the food aid will support longterm reform 
of the polish agricultural system by providing much needed 
commodities during a transitional period toward a market economy 
the president said 
the package underscores our continuing commitment to assist the 
polish government and people in their efforts to introduce market 
principles and to build a private sector that will enable poland to 
invigorate its economy he continued 
while the initial 50 million is mostly in food grants the new 
50 million installment will be composed of direct shipments 
subsidized sales and some lowinterest loans administration 
officials said

the state air resources board on thursday 
ordered that as of 1994 new cars in california must offer advanced 
computerized systems to warn drivers about faulty automobile 
equipment that causes pollution 
the new technology was approved by a 70 vote following a public 
hearing crowded with more than 75 auto industry representatives and 
environmental advocates 
the advanced system state officials said would result in 
quicker repairs of defective parts leading to lower emissions of 
smogproducing hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide 
resulting reductions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would 
amount to more than 100 tons a day apiece statewide according to an 
air board staff report 
almost half the reduction would be in the south coast air basin 
which includes los angeles orange riverside and san bernardino 
counties the area that suffers the most polluted air in the nation 
the dashboard diagnostic system which air board staff members 
estimate could cost manufacturers 45 per vehicle would have two 
purposes to improve air quality and to help mechanics repair 
hightech auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxious 
emissions 
air board engineering studies chief steve albu said it would have 
a greater impact on emissions than any other single control 
measure adopted by the board 
among those supporting the new regulation were the south coast 
air quality management district the us environmental protection 
agency the american lung association and the automobile club of 
southern california 
engineers for major auto makers said they like the idea of 
expanded onboard diagnostics but raised technical questions and 
requested more time to devise the detection systems 
due to the need to develop new unproven technology 
considerable leadtime is needed said suanne k thomas a staff 
scientist for the motor vehicle manufacturers association of the 
united states 
she said the association urged that implementation be delayed 
until the 1996 model year and phasein be extended to the 1998 model 
year 
the manufacturers group is a detroitbased industry group that 
includes chrysler ford and general motors the state board 
however decided to order the changes in 1994 with full compliance 
ordered by 1996 
in the state of california we have to be aggressive said 
jananne sharpless board chairman 
board member john lagarias said the dashboard system would 
provide for smart warning lights as opposed to current idiot 
lights 
onboard monitor lights the air board ordered on new cars 
beginning in 1988 warn drivers they need repairs only when basic 
emissionrelated parts such as the fuel system fail to work 
the new system will require improved monitoring of the fuel 
system but also monitor engine misfiring catalytic converter 
efficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air conditioning systems 
the regulation calls for onboard computers to store data that 
would help repairmen identify faulty equipment it also calls for 
standardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning tool 
so any repair shop can access the data in the vehicle computer

the miss america pageant is playing 
down the swimsuit competition this year but a competitor hopes to 
draw viewers interested in more flesh 
the platinum doll bikini contest with comedian john byner as 
host is one in a series of naughty contests that have sprung up 
over the years to counter the pageants wholesome image 
todays contest features 36 gogo girls from florida new jersey 
pennsylvania and new york said contest producer neil cirucci 
instead of the scholarship offered by the miss america program 
the gogo girls will be competing for a 10000 cash prize and the 
platinum gstring award cirucci said the secondprize winner 
gets 5000 and third prize is 3000 fourth and fifthplace 
runnersup get trips to mexico 
the contestants were auditioned by the contest organizers not 
selected in state pageants and no interview was required he 
said no evening gowns in this contest a selection of costumes 
will be stripped off to reveal halters and gstrings 
we have one girl wearing a nun outfit another whos a cowboy 
one who will be a nurse he said 
the winner will not be serenaded by there she is but instead 
will dance down the stage to a good rock n roll band cirucci 
said 
we hope to steal some thunder away from the miss america 
pageant cirucci said 
leonard horn director of the venerable miss america pageant 
which crowns miss america on saturday night called the gstring 
contest ludicrous and said it will not take away his audience 
it doesnt mean a thing to us he said its somebody just 
trying to exploit us and it will not affect us at all 
judges for the platinum doll bikini contest include former 
philadelphia phillies pitcher larry christensen tony bongiovi 
uncle of rock star jon bon jovi and owner of a recording studio and 
gennaro meoli a fashion designer for frank sinatra cirucci said 
the gstring contest is not the first time a promoter has tried 
to strip away some of the miss america pageants luster in the 
1970s several miss nude usa pageants were held the week before miss 
america 
the gstring contest was to be held at a boardwalk nightclub

the united states may be land of the free and 
home of the brave but its also the country of the fat 
a researcher on obesity says that 33 million adult americans 
about 20 percent of the adult population are significantly obese 
giving the united states one of the highest populations of fat 
people in the world 
its clear that significant obesity appears to be more 
prevalent in the united states than elsewhere dr george a bray 
a professor of medicine at louisiana state university said thursday 
the greater the excess weight the greater excess risk of 
resulting health problems he said 
obesity is a public health concern only in europe and north 
america and the percentage of significantly overweight people is 
highest by far in the united states bray said 
the scientist said researchers dont know why there is a higher 
percentage of fat adults in america than elsewhere though he 
suggests it could be because of the highly mechanized us 
civilization that makes it easy to avoid walking or climbing stairs 
bray says statistics suggest americans are eating a better diet 
now avoiding meats and other foods high in animal fats but the 
number of significantly obese people continues to creep up 
the effects of excess weight is showing up in health studies that 
show the obese are suffering more heart attacks more high blood 
pressure more diabetes and more gall bladder disease 
being extremely fat bray said is only slightly less of a health 
risk than smoking two packs of cigarettes a day 
bray presidentelect of the north american association for the 
study of obesity said doctors consider significant obesity to be a 
weight about 30 percent above what would be ideal for a persons 
age stature and gender 
thus a man whose ideal weight is 170 to 180 pounds becomes 
significantly obese if his weight balloons to 221 to 234 at 
that point he becomes almost twice as likely to develop a 
lifeshortening ailment bray said 
but numbers on the weight scale dont tell the full story 
its not just how fat you are but where the fat is located 
that will determine your risk said bray 
researchers now believe that fat located within the abdominal 
cavity poses a greater health hazard than does fat located in the 
extremities or just under the skin 
the reasons for this are not clear said bray the most 
widely accepted explanation is that when youve got more fat in your 
belly around your organs it is that fat that is released when you 
eat fatty acids 
because of its proximity such fat is thought to go directly to 
the liver where it sets up risk factors that we associate with 
heart disease diabetes hypertension and gall bladder disease he 
said 
adult men said bray seem most at risk of developing this 
unhealthy deposit of abdominal fat age also plays a factor he 
added because few children or young adults develop this type of fat 
deposit 
for women the visceral fat doesnt seem to increase until 
there is a lot of total fat he said women are protected 
against visceral fat to some degree for some reason 
smoking affects visceral or central fat said bray and 
stopping smoking tends to cause this fat to disappear even though 
the former smoker may gain fat in other areas again why this is so 
is not well understood but he said this is another good reason 
to stop smoking 
another study elsewhere shows that american youth are becoming 
more muscular but also more sedentary a lifestyle that has made 
them fatter and triggered an ominous loss of cardiovascular 
health 
a report by the chrysler fundamateur athletic union testing 
program which surveyed 12000 youths from 1980 to 1989 said there 
is no perceptible increase in height for the various age groups 
studied and that weight gains can be attributed to poorer diet and 
physical habits

the senates vote to halt smoking on all us 
airline flights leaves tobacco interests and advocates of the ban 
jockeying over how severe the final version of the restrictions will 
be 
the senate decided by voice vote to forbid cigarette smoking on 
all domestic airline routes after routing an effort by tobacco 
industry supporters to block the provision 
earlier the senate sent president bush a separate measure 
containing 225 million to begin construction of the governments 
latest boon for texas the 5 billion super conducting supercollider 
final passage of the 119 billion transportation bill for fiscal 
1990 containing the smoking restrictions was held up by a dispute 
over unrelated antidrug spending 
but when that comes the next step will be for senatehouse 
negotiators to write compromise legislation that can be sent to 
president bush the house last month approved a milder version of 
the ban which would permanently bar smoking on flights of two hours 
or shorter 
lobbyist jo ellen deutsch of the association of flight 
attendants one of several airline unions working for the total ban 
said lobbyists were trying to discern the leanings of lawmakers who 
will negotiate on the measure 
you can bet the ones who are unsure or leaning the other way 
will be hearing from us over the next few days she said 
spokesman gary miller of the cigarette industrys trade group 
the tobacco institute said his side had not given up hope of toning 
down the restrictions 
its not the law yet he said its our positive outlook 
that less extreme legislation will be the result of the 
housesenate bargaining 
in the showdown 7721 vote thursday senators forced a halt to 
delaying tactics prosmoking lawmakers had hoped would lead to 
looser restrictions 
we didnt undertake that vote in the belief we could defeat 
the proposed ban sen wendell ford dky who fought the proposal 
conceded 
sen frank lautenberg dnj who sponsored the ban proposal and 
who cited health concerns about lingering cigarette smoke in airline 
cabins said the american people are overwhelmingly in support of 
this suspension of smoking on airliners 
the senate version would extend the ban to all us routes 95 
days after the bill becomes law current restrictions prohibit 
smoking on flights of two hours or less fourfifths of all routes 
and will otherwise expire next april 
passengers caught smoking would be subject to 1000 fines and 
people found to have disabled smoke detectors in aircraft restrooms 
would face penalties of up to 2000 
opponents of the ban argued there is no proof that cigarette 
fumes harm nonsmokers and that the smoke is merely one of many 
chemicals adrift in the recirculated air inside airliners they 
called on supporters to await a transportation department study on 
airliner air quality expected by early next year 
they also said the restriction would hurt tobacco growers 
but supporters cited several studies concluding that nonsmokers 
risk cancer and other diseases by socalled passive smoking and said 
there was no reason to wait for a total prohibition 
the money for the texas atom smasher was part of an 186 billion 
energy and water measure approved on a voice vote bush a texas 
resident is expected to sign the bill 
the circular 53milelong supercollider is to be built 25 miles 
south of dallas scientists will use it to hurtle proton beams into 
each other in a search for the basic building blocks of matter 
the measure also contains 16 billion towards cleaning up the 
nations nuclear weapons plants about 70 percent more than the 975 
million provided this year and 27 percent more than bush requested 
the overall task of removing radioactive waste from the facilities 
has been estimated at 100 billion

the hourly tolling of a church bell has 
been a melodious tradition in this little farming community but for 
a couple that moved next door its more like an allnight alarm 
clock 
richard and pamela carnall who bought their house next door to 
the centuryold clock last year sued the town after the board of 
selectmen declined to silence the clock between 9 pm and 7 am 
the couple who say the chiming ruins their sleep lost their bid 
for a preliminary injunction to silence the clock in april but 
judge george c keady jr has said he will hear arguments on the 
issue oct 5 in hampshire superior court 
both sides have already made their case loud and clear richard 
carnall says he has given up trying to get to sleep before midnight 
when the bell tolls 12 times 
and dr donald b rogers of northampton who has prescribed 
sleeping pills for pamela carnall maintained in a letter to the 
judge that the bell is affecting mrs carnalls work and 
wellbeing 
the carnalls contend they have been unable to adjust to the 
bonging of the 1800pound bell on the first congregational church 
50 feet from their home 
but hatfield town counsel william oneil contended that the sound 
of the bell is simply part of life in a new england village of 3200 
people he said the carnalls both of whom were born and raised in 
the area should have noticed the bell tower and considered that 
before buying the house 
the selectmen contend the only previous complaint they ever 
received about the bell was when it didnt sound they said more 
than 200 townsfolk signed petitions in support of the clock

officials across germany 
struggling to house a crush of refugees have set up camping 
trailers commandeered school gymnasiums and even tried to persuade 
new arrivals to go elsewhere 
the east germans are only the latest wave of refugees who have 
strained west germanys social services and housing stock 
more than 400000 ethnic germans from eastern europe are expected 
this year alone the number of east germans will easily top previous 
predictions of 100000 in addition tens of thousands of asylum 
seekers from various countries arrive each year in west germany 
already one of europes most densely populated countries 
social services and school and local budgets in many communities 
already are stretched to the limit and affordable housing is 
increasingly rare in this country of 62 million people 
the east germans began arriving monday when hungary defied its 
warsaw pact ally east germany and allowed them to cross into austria 
en route to west germany 
by thursday at least 13000 east germans had arrived 
i have full understanding for why they would especially like to 
live in west berlin where they are closest to their homeland the 
citys mayor walter momper said thursday 
but he urged the new arrivals not to flood his city saying it 
already has cared for a disproportionately high number of other 
refugees 
people have more trouble finding housing and work here 
momper said in an address to the local parliament 
he called on the federal government to solve the housing problem 
as soon as possible for the east german refugees 
words about life in freedom dont fill up the stomach or put a 
roof over anyones head he said 
most of the east germans refugees are staying with friends and 
relatives still many have needed temporary shelter provided by 
various west german states 
hamburg for example set up 60 camping trailers at a city camp 
site 
trailers are better than tents said hamburgs social 
services director ortwin runde they let the people have more 
freedom and theyre better suited for the winter months 
in wiesbaden the no 2 official of the hesse state social 
services ministry said sports fans should not worry that local 
school gymnasiums had been requisitioned as temporary shelters 
they can be cleared out and used for sports again because the 
majority of the newcomers have quickly gone on to friends and 
relatives gerald weiss said 
weiss said the centrally located state even planned to close 15 
of the 20 emergency shelters now that the wave of east german 
refugees apparently has peaked 
still the longterm housing situation will remain a problem in a 
country where families with two children live in twobedroom 
apartments measuring 120 square yards and often less 
many of the newcomers are young people in their 20s and 30s and 
many are families with young children 
in bonn government spokesman hans klein said federal officials 
will meet soon to map a housing strategy

a group of women has appealed to the us 
supreme court to review ah robins cos reorganization plan and 
its 25 billion settlement for victims of the dalkon shield 
birthcontrol device 
the appeal was filed thursday the deadline for opponents of the 
richmondbased companys bankruptcy reorganization plan to challenge 
the plan to compensate about 195000 women who claimed injuries from 
the intrauterine device marketed by the company in the early 1970s 
douglas e bragg a denver attorney for more than 100 dalkon 
shield appellants said the 25 billion trust fund to pay claimants 
is inadequate he said full payment of claims could cost as much as 
7 billion 
but the director of the dalkon shield victims association said 
the appeal may cause some dalkon claimants to wonder if they will 
ever get paid 
im worried mostly that women will lose heart said linda 
hightower there have been so many delays its very difficult for 
them to understand 
more than 94 percent of the claimants voted in favor of the 
reorganization plan confirmed by us district judge robert r 
merhige jr but about 900 women had rejected the plan which was 
upheld in june by the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
alan b morrison lead attorney for opponents of the 
reorganization said his clients object to the plans prohibition on 
the filing of separate lawsuits against robins corporate officers 
and other third parties 
but ms hightower and company officials said the appeal will only 
cause further delays 
while i understand their reasoning its very difficult to 
explain when we have a good plan and most of these women have 
already waited 18 years ms hightower said by telephone from her 
home in atlanta im very upset by it because it means a delay to 
all of the women 
roscoe e puckett a robins spokesman said the company also 
regretted the appeal because it would delay compensation to 
claimants puckett has said the trust could have been funded by 
sept 28 if no further appeals had been filed 
robins has until oct 16 to file a response to the appeal with 
the supreme court after which the court will decide whether to 
review the case 
the reorganization plan was worked out over a threeyear period 
after robins sought chapter 11 protection from creditors in august 
1985 
the reorganization plan also included the acquisition of robins 
through a 700 million exchange of stock by the american home 
products corp of new york 
when robins filed for protection the company had settled about 
twothirds of approximately 15000 lawsuits brought by women who 
alleged injuries ranging from infections to sterility to miscarriage 
from using the iud 
under the reorganization plan the 25 billion fund to pay 
dalkon shield claims will be administered by trustees independent of 
robins the plan also includes full payment to robins other 
creditors 
pending a resolution of appeals only 100 million of the trust 
has been available to settle claims as of this week 528 million 
had been paid to settle more than 81000 claims said tom morris a 
spokesman for the trust

brain scans can reveal a shrinkage in some tissue 
that may be an early sign of alzheimers disease even in people not 
yet diagnosed a new study suggests 
the shrinkage appeared more frequently in alzheimers patients 
and in people who were later diagnosed with the disease than in 
other people researchers reported 
if further research confirms the result scanning for the 
abnormality may be useful as one step in diagnosing the disease 
study coauthor mony deleon said thursday 
the work is reported in saturdays issue of the lancet a british 
medical journal by deleon and colleagues at the new york university 
medical center 
alzheimers disease is a progressive condition that attacks the 
brain and impairs thinking memory and behavior it affects an 
estimated 25 million american adults no cause or cure is known 
researchers used a procedure involving computerized tomography 
an xray technique commonly called ct scanning to study a portion 
of the brain called the hippocampus 
they examined 76 patients with mild to severe alzheimers 27 
with minimal agerelated memory changes and 72 normal volunteers 
all with an average age in their early 70s 
shrinkage in the hippocampus appeared in 87 percent of the 
alzheimers group and 70 percent of those with mild memory 
impairment compared to 22 percent of the normal volunteers 
researchers also followed 20 patients with mild memory impairment 
and 28 healthy people of similar ages by three years later 11 of 
the subjects were diagnosed with alzheimers ten of them had shown 
shrinkage in the hippocampus in the initial examination 
of the 37 people not diagnosed with alzheimers by three years 
later only seven had shown the hippocampus abnormality 
robert terry of the university of california in san diego said 
results suggest the abnormality may help in diagnosis of 
alzheimers but because it also appears in normal people it cannot 
be used by itself 
deleon said the people who were not diagnosed with alzheimers 
within three years may be at risk for developing outward symptoms 
later

commodity analysts in the agriculture 
department believe wheat farmers wont go overboard in signing up 
for a new option designed to boost 1990 production 
the option announced this week by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter would let a farmer boost plantings by as much as 10 percent 
from what otherwise would be allowed by the 1990 program 
yeutter said the increase is needed to help rebuild us food 
stockpiles including a special food security reserve to meet 
global food aid requirements 
but some members of congress fear production might rise more 
sharply than usda projects and push down market prices and the 
national association of wheat growers has reservations about the 
plan 
william e penn assistant deputy administrator for state and 
county operations in the departments agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service said the program contains some down sides 
that could discourage wheat farmers from planting too much wheat 
the 1990 wheat program without the option calls for farmers to 
idle 5 percent of their base acreage to qualify for price support 
benefits this acreage reserve program feature means farmers can 
plant wheat on 95 percent of their base 
with the option announced by yeutter producers can sign up to 
plant wheat on more than 95 percent of their land up to 105 
percent or 10 percent more than they otherwise would be permitted 
under the basic 1990 program 
but penn noted for every acre that you go over your normal 
base you take an acre cut in the acres eligible for payment 
under the programs targetprice formula 
another dampener he said thursday in a telephone interview is 
that the additional acres will not be counted as planting history 
for the purpose of adjusting wheat bases in the future 
so if you plant 101 percent youre not going to get credit 
for that 1 percent as wheat for the purpose of calculating the base 
for next year penn said 
the signup for 1990 commodity programs will be held january 16 
through april 13 at county ascs offices penn said farmers will be 
able to decide then whether to participate in the optional wheat 
program 
meanwhile wheatstate congressmen said the usdas decision could 
weaken prices and hurt producers in some regions 
rep pat roberts rkan whose state is the leading wheat 
producer said the move could send farmers back down the road of 
low prices and overproduction 
rep bob smith rore complained now is not the time to 
gamble with wheat farmers income 
although the nations wheat stockpiles have dropped because of 
two years of drought roberts and smith said usda was overreacting 
to the lower inventories 
its risky very risky said smith if increased crops do 
not result in a significant price drop then wheat farmers might 
benefit but thats assuming a lot basic laws of supply and demand 
would dictate that the price could fall 
roberts said the usda option would come too late for some winter 
wheat producers to alter their planting preparations especially if 
they had grown fallharvested grain sorghum or soybeans after their 
wheat crop failed earlier this year because of drought 
farmer are planting winter wheat now for harvest next year it 
accounts for about threefourths of the us wheat total 
change for the sake of change to this degree is just going to 
confuse farmers and irritate them to say the least and its done 
just that said roberts 
the us wheat carryover at the beginning of the current 
marketing year on june 1 was about 694 million bushels down from 
1261 billion bushels on june 1 1988 and 1821 billion bushels on 
june 1 1987 
according to usda projections the carryover may be down to 494 
million bushels by next june 1 despite a larger harvest this year 
demand for wheat continues to outstrip production 
department analysts say the 1990 option is expected to boost the 
acreage for harvest by 21 million acres to an estimated 696 
million acres as a result they say the 1990 harvest would rise 
only 66 million bushels to 2596 billion bushels 
the national association of wheat growers was less critical of 
the usda announcement but association president reggie wyckoff said 
us export efforts should be stepped up if plantings increase 
producers want to be assured that they wont be caught holding 
a mountain of surplus grain if this experiment fails wyckoff a 
genoa colo wheat farmer said in a statement issued by the 
associations washington office

hundreds of east german refugees have 
driven into this country in a cloud of pollution from their tiny 
exhaustbelching cars 
the east german trabants have two cylinders and run on a mixture 
of gasoline and oil 
the cars do not meet west germanys strict emission control laws 
and the environmental green party says one should be put in a museum 
with a sign forest killer and the rest sent to the scrap heap 
west german transportation officials have been issuing special 
permits to allow the east germans to drive the rickety 
plasticandfiberglass cars 
but the greens object to a plan by the federal transport ministry 
to give wholesale exemptions to the new drivers 
instead they say the government should hand out annual federal 
railway passes worth about 4000 each in exchange for the 
trabants 
were going to have to come up with some imaginative solutions 
to this problem said erhard jauck a spokesman for the bavarian 
interior ministry east germans typically wait more than 11 years 
for a trabant and more than 14 years for the larger wartburg sedans 
some refugees drive 
but after they become established in west germany most refugees 
probably will get rid of their cars 
some will do so for reasons other than pollution however 
west berlin is surrounded by east german territory and many of 
the refugees who want to settle in the city are reluctant to drive 
their car which still carry east german license plates 70 miles 
across their homeland to reach west berlin

the high school dropout rate for hispanics is 
nearing a national tragedy says education secretary lauro 
cavazos who points to a new study showing dropout rates for other 
students have fallen in the last decade 
cavazos said the study released thursday by the national center 
for education statistics disputes the popular perception that 
overall dropout rates have been rising 
but he said statistics on hispanics are troubling because they 
show onethird of all hispanics aged 16 to 24 were not enrolled in 
school and were not high school graduates last year 
the report dropout rates in the united states 1988 showed 
44 percent of students in grades 10 through 12 dropped out of high 
school annually in the years 19851988 down from 66 percent in 
1978 nearly 13 percent of all 16 to 24yearolds were not in 
school and had not completed school last year down from 16 percent 
in 1968 
while the report shows some progress cavazos said i find 
much in it alarming the nation cannot rest any easier based upon 
our findings 
as of 1988 42 million young adults were without a high school 
diploma while overall rates may be down slightly for our 
hispanic population the dropout problem is a national tragedy 
onethird of hispanic young adults were not high school graduates in 
1988 said cavazos the first hispanic to head the department 
overall the dropout rates were 15 percent for whites 22 percent 
for blacks and 28 percent for hispanics the majority of dropouts 
are whites who accounted for 66 percent of all young adults without 
diplomas 
the dropout rates for american indians and alaskan natives were 
35 percent while those for asian students were 8 percent 
cavazos said the glimmer of hope in the report is that the 
disparity between white and black students has narrowed the 
report showed dropout rates for whites and blacks are similar when 
individual and family backgrounds are taken into account such as 
the rates for blacks and whites living in central cities and those 
living in suburbs 
the center tracked a sample of students who were high school 
sophomores in 1980 and found 17 percent had not graduated by 1982 
however 46 percent of these dropouts had completed school by 1986 
the study was required by the hawkinsstafford elementary and 
secondary school improvement amendments of 1988

six topics will claim the attention of 
president bush and the nations governors later this month at an 
education summit that seeks to keep the school reform movement from 
going the way of the hula hoop twist and the edsel 
arkansas gov bill clinton outlined the tentative agenda for the 
summit thursday and said the meetings slated for sept 2728 in 
charlottesville va must result in agreement on what children 
should know before graduation 
national performance targets or goals are essential to sustain 
this education reform movement that started with the governments 
1983 nation at risk report which alerted the country to 
schools academic failures clinton told reporters 
i wake up at night with a bad dream that the education reform 
movement will go the way of the hula hoop twist and the edsel he 
said 
clinton a democrat met with white house officials wednesday 
along with south carolina republican gov carroll campbell to 
discuss the agenda and other details of the summit 
talks will focus on six topics that are broad enough to embrace 
everything we need to discuss clinton said the remaining dispute 
is whether the meetings will be open 
clinton said the issues will include teaching as a 
profession the learning environment of children including the 
special needs of the disadvantaged and drugfree schools 
restructuring schools including ways to give parents and children 
more options lifelong learning including adult literacy 
vocational and onthejob training higher education and the 
responsibilities of the various levels of government 
i think it will be very interesting to see what will come out 
of this in terms of specifics said clinton but i wouldnt 
minimize the importance of having a national set of performance 
goals which the president embraces 
clinton said he had not spoken to all of the governors about 
setting national goals but he said the idea has consistently been 
our policy and i have no reason to believe they arent in favor of 
that approach 
the white house officials clinton said were pretty positive 
the arkansas governor also is pushing to keep most of the summit 
sessions open 
responding to reports that some governors are upset that the 
working meetings will be closed white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the governors told the white house they wanted it 
that way so they were free to tell the president what they 
really thought 
the only sessions that are closed are the working sessions and 
i think they prefer them that way he said fitzwater promised 
ample media access to the plenary sessions and press conferences 
backtoback every minute of the morning

pentagon officials and the manufacturer of the 
navys new 12 billion destroyer are disputing charges the ship is 
a procurement nightmare of cost overruns and schedule delays 
the ship is ready in every respect to be launched william e 
haggett chairman and chief executive officer of bath iron works 
said thursday 
haggett spoke after rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations wrote the navy complaining the program is 18 months 
behind schedule and the ddg51 destroyer that bath iron works will 
launch saturday is only 38 percent complete 
the ship has suffered huge overruns with the design costs 
increasing by about 120 percent and construction costs have 
increased by more than 60 percent dingell said in a sept 12 
letter to navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii 
hailed as the worlds most advanced surface combat ship the 
guidedmissile destroyer is designed with a more expensive allsteel 
superstructure instead of one that was part aluminum and more prone 
to splintering and fire damage it will be equipped with 
sophisticated aegis computers and tomahawk cruise missiles 
according to dingells letter design costs have increased from 
the original contract estimate of 111 million to 247 million and 
construction costs have grown from 157 million to 252 million 
a total of 760 change orders have been made he said one 
involved the combat system and included 44 modifications to the 
original ship design requiring revisions to 30 to 40 percent of the 
ships drawings 
dingell based his charges on a draft report from the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress which is 
conducting an inquiry into the program the gaos final report is 
expected later this year 
the acquisition of the ddg51 has turned into a procurement 
nightmare dingell said in the letter 
haggett called dingells assessment a distortion of the overall 
picture on the destroyer program and factually incorrect navy 
cmdr mark baker said the service considers the program well under 
control in both cost and schedule 
this launching represents the normal progression in the 
construction equipment activation and test plan the remaining work 
on the ship requires the ship to be afloat baker said in a 
statement 
according to baker the production schedule calls for the ship to 
be delivered in february 1991 the original delivery date of october 
1989 was changed due to a 99day strike at bath iron works in 1985 
a requirement of additional navy testing of the combat system and 
problems with computeraided design 
haggett said the ddg51 is 47 to 51 percent complete a higher 
level than we launched our previous prototype ship he disputed 
dingells total of 760 change orders saying the actual number is 
less than 300 
haggett also questioned dingells claim that the company has 
petitioned the navy for an 85 million bailout or threatened to go 
bankrupt we repeatedly told the navy that this company is 
financially viable haggett said in a telephone interview from 
bath maine 
dingell also said bath iron works despite four years of work on 
the design and construction of the destroyer still has not supplied 
the navy with a validated design and production drawings 
the design is in excellent condition we have over 3000 
drawings haggett said 
rep charles e bennett dfla chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials played down the charges raised by dingell 
i dont see anything very scandalous bennett said in an 
interview it still will be the best ship of its class in the 
world

britain last year made a record 38000 drug 
seizures and convicted a record 30500 offenders home secretary 
douglas hurd said 
the 13 million worth of drugs seized last year is nearly seven 
times the 2 million total in 1987 
hurd said 94 percent of the increase was attributed to marijuana 
seizures 
the 700 pounds of cocaine seized last year is three times higher 
than the 1986 level although lower than the nearly 900 pounds 
seized in 1987 
this confirms the need for our action to choke off the 
supply of this drug while maintaining our efforts to reduce demand 
for it particularly in the form of crack hurd said 
the number of drug seizures in 1988 was 25 percent higher than in 
1987 and the number of convictions for drug offenses was 16 percent 
higher

black members of congress who in 20 years 
have moved from outsiders demanding black power to insiders wielding 
it are celebrating their successes this week while considering how 
best to use a 2 million war chest 
the money much of it raised from corporate donors was not on 
the formal agenda for the congressional black caucus annual 
legislative weekend that opened thursday and runs through 
saturday night 
but it was a matter of behindthescenes debate among the 23 
blacks who are members of congress as they were joined by thousands 
of black political elite from around the country for the gala 
fundraiser social event and policy discussion 
rep kweisi mfume a secondterm democrat representing baltimore 
md who adopted an african name said the 23 black members of 
congress are considering several proposals for spending the money 
among them are to establish a think tank doing blackoriented 
research a recruitment center aimed at developing black political 
candidates and even a computerized library on africanamerican 
culture 
we ought to make ourselves more effective with the money 
mfume said 
a 300aplate blacktie dinner saturday night is expected to 
attract 4000 guests and more than 20000 people will participate 
in related events including a black fashion show and numerous 
parties 
the congressional black caucus is hosting the threeday session 
at a time when black political leaders have successes to celebrate 
such as the victory in tuesdays new york democratic mayoral primary 
of black candidate david dinkins and the candidacy in virginia of 
democratic nominee douglas wilder who seeks to become the first 
black elected governor 
blacks in congress are enjoying unprecedented power too much of 
it is the result of advances through the seniority system that 
awards power to the most veteran members the same system that once 
benefited white southern conservatives who were reelected with 
little opposition time after time 
their numbers have grown since the congressional black caucus was 
formed in 1970 when there were 13 members but more importantly 
caucus members now hold the chairmanships of five house committees 
and 18 subcommittees and young black newcomers are working their 
way up some of the most influential congressional committees 
the staying power of their members and the number of 
chairmanships that they have make them an effective force said 
former rep james jones of oklahoma who is white 
one member rep william gray dpa has leapfrogged ahead 
serving last term as budget committee chairman and winning the house 
democrats no 3 leadership position this year as majority whip 
the rise in power is limited to the house however the senate 
has no black members 
the number of blacks in congress has at least temporarily 
declined with the death in an african plane crash last month of rep 
mickey leland dtexas leland was mourned at several of the caucus 
opening events 
president bush earlier this year hosted the caucus at the white 
house its first invitation there in eight years 
in addition to the chance to discuss issues members estimate 
this years legislative weekend event will raise 1 million for the 
congressional black caucus foundation a legally separate entity 
with interlocking board members 
with corporations donating sums of 50000 in some cases income 
in recent years has exceeded spending on fellowships internships 
and scholarships allowing the foundation to purchase its own 
building and to accumulate a reserve of just over 2 million 
according to foundation financial records for the year ending dec 
31 1988 
another issue under debate by black members involves whether the 
caucus should continue accepting large contributions to the 
foundation from tobacco companies and liquor manufacturers which 
some members feel are contributing to health problems within the 
black community the caucus lists companies including philip morris 
rjr nabisco anheuserbusch courvoisier cognac vsop stroh brewery 
and seagram co among its major contributors

meet with espn and major league officials to demand access to 
wednesday and sunday games said john serrao chairman of the 
association of independent television stations 
an immediate effort will be made to seek the elimination of the 
exclusive restrictions on the wednesday and sunday night 
blackouts serrao said these blackouts on free overtheair tv 
are contrary to the public interest 
local tv stations that already had contracted with individual 
baseball teams to carry a certain number of games during the season 
now have no access to wednesdays and sundays the station executives 
said meanwhile regional cable sports networks can show the games 
the executives said 
local broadcasters have no legal recourse because major league 
baseball agreements supersede contracts made by individual teams 
berkery said 
the same situation applies when college athletic conferences such 
as the big 10 and pacific 10 make cable agreements that override 
contracts between individual schools and local broadcasters intv 
president preston padden said 
officials at the national cable television association in 
washington were out of the office and not available for comment 
thursday but the ncta has said that local broadcasters are showing 
40 percent more professional baseball games now than in 1975 and 
that cable is not siphoning away free tv sports 
major league baseball spokesman richard levin reached by 
telephone in milwaukee where team owners are meeting would not 
comment on the broadcasters allegations 
the broadcasters said they will urge congress to hold hearings 
to investigate the alarming siphoning of sports from free 
overtheair television 
they said they were given assurances in meetings with sens arlen 
specter rpa and al gore dtenn that their concerns will be 
heard on capitol hill 
gore told the broadcasters he will seek hearings this fall on his 
bill to reregulate the cable tv industry and on other cable tv bills 
now pending gore spokeswoman marla romash said later 
one of senator gores concerns is the flight of athletics from 
free tv to pay tv romash said noting that there is no pending 
legislation that specifically addresses that issue 
gore is a member of the senate commerce communications 
subcommittee and specter is on the senate judiciary antitrust 
monopolies and business rights subcommittee 
dan craig executive assistant to sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
chairman of the communications subcommittee said i dont see a 
standalone sports hearing but certainly during the cable 
oversight hearings youre bound to get some hard questioning on the 
migration of sports

a government study in which expensive 
orthopedic shoes will be bought for some diabetic medicare patients 
but not others is being criticized for jeopardizing health in the 
name of medical economics 
i consider it morally reprehensible to not provide the shoes 
to some diabetics at high risk of foot amputations said stan matek 
executive director of the new york state podiatric medical 
association 
but project staff members say no one is being denied anything 
rather some medicare recipients are getting something extra and 
that the benefits of the study will reach all such patients they 
say 
under the study that began last month medicare is choosing 
27000 diabetic patients in new york california and florida who 
have a high risk of hospitalization or amputation because of 
circulatory problems in their feet half will be reimbursed for up 
to 305 for a pair of therapeutic shoes or inserts but the other 
half will not though they can still buy the footwear 
the idea is to determine if the government would save money in 
the long run by providing shoes to such patients 
about 20000 diabetics each year have parts of their legs and 
feet removed many experts say speciallyfitted shoes have been 
shown to prevent the problems that lead to amputations 
matek said he finds it morally unacceptable to deny a 
recognizably beneficial intervention to one out of every two people 
at high risk for amputation 
and he says since medicare patients in the study who are not 
reimbursed can still buy the shoes theres no point in doing a 
costeffectiveness comparison 
but judith wooldridge project director at mathematica a 
princeton nj health policy study group commissioned by the 
health care financing administration to do the study dismisses the 
ethical concerns as illogical 
they interpret it as someone being denied something but no one 
is going to be denied anything some are going to receive something 
extra she said 
the legislation that called for the study says the benefit will 
not go into effect if the study shows money would not be saved in 
the long run by paying for the shoes 
wooldridge and others in all likelihood therapeutic footwear for 
diabetics will become a covered medicare benefit at least by 1993 
the bill originally made the shoes a covered benefit but got 
caught in the budget squeeze after the stock market crash in october 
1987 backers in congress compromised to save the bill by calling 
for a study to verify claims it would save 25 million a year by 
avoiding costly hospitalizations and amputations 
sidney trieger director of the division of health systems and 
special studies in hcfas office of demonstrations said when 
congress says do a demonstration that means there will be certain 
people who get the benefit and certain people who dont 
about 2500 podiatrists and other physicians in the three states 
have expressed willingness to participate so far 
dr stephen meritt a jacksonville fla podiatrist who is 
president of the florida podiatric medical association said he will 
participate in the study though he is concerned patients who need 
the shoes will hold off buying them until they find out whether 
medicare will pay for them 
im going to recommend that they get the shoe regardless of 
whether the government will pay he said i dont want my patients 
waiting on the government that could be hazardous and that 
concerns me

president bushs plan to give states almost 
500 million to fight drugs will result in a net loss of federal 
dollars in 22 states because of offsetting cuts in related programs 
a democratic study group says 
each of the programs being cut deals in one way or another 
with conditions in society which many experts argue are direct 
contributing causes of drug abuse the house of representatives 
democratic study group said thursday 
the group measured the total bush said he would like to give 
states for law enforcement and prevention and treatment against 
losses in programs for immigration economic development and 
juvenile justice 
according to the group 43 states would lose federal assistance 
equal to more than half their new drug fund allocation under the 
bush plan 
of those states 22 would have losses exceeding estimated gains 
as would the district of columbia and the us territories the 
study said 
the worst losses would be in california where cuts would equal 
nearly four times the amount of money received under the drug plan 
a net loss of 150 million 
in texas cuts are expected to be twice as much for a net loss 
of 255 million the study said and in the district of columbia 
the cuts are expected to take about 70 percent more out of the 
budget than the proposed new funding will put in for a net loss of 
11 million the study said 
for the states district of columbia and the territories the 
total new spending is supposed to be 449 million under the bush 
plan but the cuts in such programs as immigration juvenile justice 
and economic development will total 557 million for a net loss of 
108 million the study said 
the study did not count the 50 million in bushs proposal for 
public housing programs because it comes out of an account already 
earmarked for public housing the funding request covers the 1990 
fiscal year

the police chief of this city added his 
voice to nationwide calls for a ban on assault weapons after a man 
using an ak47 rifle shot 20 former coworkers at a printing plant 
before killing himself 
you dont need these kinds of weapons unless youre a police 
officer or a criminal police chief richard dotson said at a news 
conference where he held up the ak47 and one of the two mac11 
semiautomatic machine pistols used in thursdays rampage 
the gunman joseph t wesbecker committed suicide after killing 
seven and wounding 13 workers at the standard gravure corp where he 
worked until a year ago 
what do you need these for except for killing people 
dotson said 
police said wesbecker also was armed with a 38caliber handgun 
a 9mm sigsauer pistol and a bayonet that apparently fit the ak47 
he carried several thousand rounds of ammunition 
youve got to wonder whether these assault rifles should be 
banned from the ability to purchase them within the confines of the 
united states said louisville mayor jerry abramson who was given 
a tour through the carnage by police 
i saw people in excruciating pain with bodies strewn 
throughout the three floors the scene was like a vietnam or world 
war ii 
a lobbyist for the national rifle association acknowledged the 
massacre would put the organization in a more guarded position as it 
attempts to deflect legislation to ban assaultstyle weapons 
any time theres a tragedy of this degree its going to require 
us to be responsive to increased concerns but the bottom line issue 
is the same would a gun law have stopped this kind of thing said 
jim baker the lobbyist we dont think so 
the bush administration imposed an import ban on assaulttype 
rifles in july but the ban didnt affect guns already owned by 
americans or similar weapons produced by us companies 
california in may became the first state to enact restrictions on 
the possession or sale of the guns the law was prompted by the 
shooting of 35 people at a stockton calif schoolyard by a gunman 
with an ak47 
how many more louisville and stockton massacres must happen 
before our lawmakers have the courage to stand up to the gun 
lobby said sarah brady chairwoman of the national handgun 
control lobbying group 
my heart goes out to the families of the victims of this 
horrible tragedy in louisville she said in a news release its 
too late for them but we can prevent further massacres involving 
assault weapons if congress will approve pending legislation 
mrs bradys husband former white house press secretary james 
brady was seriously injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on 
president reagan 
ray yeager owner of rays gun shop in louisville said laws 
regulating the sale of assault weapons such as the sovietdesigned 
ak47 are just about the same as it is in any state its the same 
as buying a shotgun or any other type of rifle 
he said a customer wanting to purchase an ak47 would have to 
present a valid drivers license and fill out a federal form 
the senate judiciary committee has approved a measure that would 
ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons five 
already covered by the administrations import ban and four others 
produced domestically 
while providing up to 10 years additional prison time for those 
convicted of crimes involving firearms the law would go off the 
books in three years under a sunset provision

house democrats are gearing up for another 
battle with president bush over the minimum wage offering to accept 
his 425 hourly floor but refusing bushs call for a lower pay 
scale for all new hires 
the house education and labor committees labor standards 
subcommittee on thursday approved on a 74 partyline vote a plan 
to raise the 335anhour wage floor by 45 cents this january and 
by another 45 cents in january 1991 
but the panel refused to expand provisions in a bill vetoed by 
bush in june that would allow employers to continue paying a 335 
minimum only to people beginning their first job and only for the 
first 60 days of their employment 
bush has said he would veto the bill again if it phases in the 
increase to 425 in less than three years he also insists that a 
lower training wage be allowed for six months for any person 
newly hired regardless of their previous work experience 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said in a letter to the panel 
wednesday to that the compromise offer put together by chairman 
austin murphy dpa with support from the aflcio continues to 
be unacceptable to the president and would call for a veto 
rep thomas e petri of wisconsin the subcommittees ranking 
republican said minimum wage advocates should accept the proposal 
bush offered in march and declare a victory 
otherwise said rep steve bartlett rtexas there will only be 
continued deadlock 
democrats however said the only concession they were willing to 
make was reducing to 425 the 455 minimum in the bill that passed 
congress last spring and bush vetoed 
im not moving back one step further said rep carl perkins 
dky noting the minimum wage has been frozen at 335 since 1981 
ive seen too much given away for the sake of people who dont 
care 
perkins said bush is not so much interested in the legislation 
than he is trying to prove a point and that saddens me 
on a 65 vote with murphy breaking away from his fellow 
democrats the panel rejected an amendment by bartlett to remove 
overtime or minimum wage exemptions for some 30 different 
classifications of workers 
among the exemptions which have worked their way into the law 
over the past 50 years are fishermen tobacco strippers amusement 
park workers employees of newspapers with less than 4000 
circulation radio and tv announcers in cities of less than 100000 
laundry workers and domestic maids 
while the idea intrigued many more democrats rep augustus 
hawkins dcalif the full committees chairman called bartletts 
proposal a killer amendment that would erode support for the 
bill 
the education and labor committee is scheduled to take up the 
legislation next tuesday just before congress recessed in august 
the senate labor and human resources committee reapproved without 
change the bill that bush vetoed in june 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has said he 
is willing to change it on the senate floor to accommodate the 
houses action or if a compromise can be struck with bush

americas youngsters are suffering an 
ominous decline in cardiovascular health from poor eating 
habits inadequate physical training at school and their growing 
preference for video games over the playground variety according to 
a decadelong study 
an annual random sampling from the millions of boys and girls who 
participated in the chrysler fundamateur athletic unions fitness 
testing program shows a 10 percent decline in average scores for 
distance runs the component measuring aerobic endurance or heart 
and lung strength 
and in the same 198089 period there was also a major dropoff 
from 43 percent to 32 percent in those who achieved at least 
satisfactory scores in the entire test despite some improvement 
in muscular strength 
weve really got a problem here said wynn f updyke 
director of the chryslersponsored aau physical fitness program 
which now enrolls 97 million youngsters aged 6 to 17 
the cardiovascular trend is ominous based on what we know 
about the link between heart disease and inactivity and nutritional 
bad habits he said 
at a news conference updyke an associate dean at indiana 
university cited a variety of causes for the poorer aerobic 
showings including less emphasis on physical training in the 
schools only one state illinois now requires physical education 
for children in all grades he noted 
and technology at best has been a mixed blessing he said 
because kids are saving their competitive instincts for nintendo 
and other computer games instead of kickthecan and other physical 
activity 
the programs printed report based on a sample of 12000 
youngsters whose test scores were picked at random each year also 
applied the word ominous to the creeping weight gain observed 
for most age groups over the decade children of all school ages 6 
to 17 were measured by the tests 
there was no perceptible increase in height for the various age 
groups so the weight gains were attributed to poor dietary and 
physical habits it said for example girls aged 12 and 13 averaged 
615 inches in height in both 1980 and 1989 but they were 92 
pounds heavier at 112 this year boys aged 1417 actually were 
more than an inch shorter on average this year at 5 feet 7 
but weighed nearly five pounds more at 142 
the program involves a battery of aau tests dating to 1943 
though the report released thursday was the first decadelong study 
based on annual testing 
for all age brackets it consisted of an endurance run pullups 
boys or flexed arm hang girls a sit and reach test for 
flexibility regular situps and one of five optional events to 
demonstrate motor skills long jump sprint shuttle run modified 
pushup isometric pushup or isometric squat 
the report said the best investment parents can make in the 
physical fitness of their children is to insist on high quality 
physical education programs in their schools 
updyke rejected the notion that more time in the gym or on the 
playground would cut into academic opportunities for children 
fitness makes you a greater accountant a greater president of the 
united states a better anything he said

opponents of the planned resettlement of the 
love canal neighborhood mostly cite health concerns but they also 
dont want to lose a national symbol of an environmental disaster 
an activist said 
eleven years after officials evacuated hundreds of families from 
the niagara falls neighborhood when chemicals from a dump seeped 
into homes state health officials say people can move back into the 
area after years of cleanup 
resettlement opponents however question whether the 
neighborhood is safe hundreds of environmentalists and religious 
activists plan to attend a rally in albany tonight in hopes of 
persuading gov mario cuomo to stop the planned resettlement 
lois gibbs the former love canal homemaker who became wellknown 
in the environmental movement after leading her former neighbors in 
a fight for federal assistance said she also doesnt want to lose 
love canals symbolic value 
by making it habitable it steals away the symbol from the 
people gibbs said in an interview this week love canal is a 
symbol for problems across the country 
anywhere i go in the country regardless of what people are 
fighting they refer to the damage created by that particular 
facility as love canal said gibbs who now works for the 
virginiabased citizens clearinghouse for hazardous waste she is an 
organizer for todays rally 
last fall dr david axelrod the state health commissioner 
ruled that twothirds of the love canal neighborhood was suitable 
for resettlement after years of work to contain or treat the toxic 
contamination from the dump site 
resettlement of the homes is scheduled for next year 
occidental chemical corp owner of the former hooker chemical 
and plastic co which used love canal as a waste dump acknowledges 
that 20000 tons of chemical wastes were dumped there in the 1940s 
and 1950s 
the dump was covered and the niagara falls school district bought 
the land and built a school and playground there developers built 
hundreds of homes nearby during the 1960s foul odors and oozing 
chemicals were the first signs for residents that something was 
wrong 
the chemical contamination remains in a giant fenced mound at the 
center of the neighborhood 
occidental declined to comment on todays rally 
today about 70 homes in love canal are occupied by people who 
chose not to leave when the neighborhood was declared a federal 
emergency area in 1978 but the overriding image of the neighborhood 
is one of block after block of bulldozed lawns and boardedup tract 
homes 
the current residents hope that cuomo wont stop the resettlement 
we pray that this demonstration will not sway you or your 
agencies progress toward the remediation and resettlement of this 
area said a letter from a residents group 
axelrods conclusion was based on studies comparing levels of 
toxics with those found in other areas of niagara falls 
based on what we know people would not be exposed to any 
higher risk there than they would be elsewhere in the greater 
niagara falls community said peter slocum axelrods spokesman 
a potential sticking point however is that scientists used a 
comparison standard for certain chemical levels in the 
neighborhood because we dont have a better standard slocum 
said 
gibbs and others fear that the levels used for comparison in love 
canal will set a precedent 
if they let people back in with those levels then essentially 
they are legalizing those levels said gibbs thats a precedent 
that we cannot allow

misgivings about us policy toward cambodia 
have surfaced in congress in anticipation of the promised withdrawal 
of vietnamese forces from the southeast asian country later this 
month 
several congressmen accused the bush administration thursday of 
taking a weak stand at the recent international conference on 
cambodia against return of the khmer rouge the communists accused 
of causing more than a million cambodian deaths during their 197578 
killing fields rule over cambodia 
given the moral consequences of failure given the possibility 
that the khmer rouge may return if there was ever an issue in 
which consultation between the executive branch and congress is an 
absolute necessity this is the one rep stephen solarz dny 
told his house asianpacific affairs subcommittee after a public 
hearing on the issue 
spectators were then cleared from the room to enable a senior 
state department official to clarify in closed session the us 
strategy for blocking the khmer rouge from returning to power 
the official richard solomon assistant secretary of state for 
east asian and pacific affairs during the public debate blasted as 
grossly unfair and inaccurate implications that somehow we are 
trying to whitewash what happened during the 1970s in cambodia 
solomon said he would have to dig into the records of the failed 
cambodian conference last month in paris to provide concrete 
evidence of the stand the united states took there against past 
khmer route genocide he said tactics for future dealings with the 
khmer rouge could be explained only in closed session 
the administration favors no role for the khmer rouge in a 
future cambodian government but continues to support cambodian 
prince sihanouk and his desire to remain allied with the khmer rouge 
in a fourparty transition government solomon testified 
in paris the united states agreed with sihanouk china and 
countries of the association of southeast asian nations that the 
khmer rouge could be better controlled if they were inside the new 
regime and that excluding them would be a sure formula for 
civil war once the vietnamese leave 
rep chester atkins dmass accused the administration of 
publicly condemning the khmer rouge but remaining silent and taking 
no action at working sessions 
he charged that the paris conference failed in large measure 
because the khmer rouge and its international backers sought to 
expunge from all official records any acknowledgment of their acts 
of genocide and the united states acquiesced 
the us position meant that we are clinging to the outmoded 
policies and paranoia of the vietnam war but the war is over and 
the world has changed we are not able by sheer force and strong 
will to create a cambodian government that is absolutely to our 
liking atkins said if stopping the khmer rouge means taking 
a fresh more reasoned assessment of the successes of the 
vietnaminstalled hun sen government then so be it 
rep jim leach riowa said the united states does not have 
the luxury of avoiding such moral issues as khmer rouge 
genocide he said khmer rouge leader pol pot should be tried by 
an international court for war crimes 
solomon said the paris negotiations are in suspension and could 
be resumed if progress appears likely after six months of 
lowerlevel talks he blamed failure to achieve a comprehensive 
settlement at paris on vietnam and hun sen head of the 
vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia they refused to 
compromise on sihanouks fourparty formula and sought to retain the 
infrastructure of the hun sen government giving it unfair advantage 
in promised elections he said 
sihanouk is not infallible he is capable of monumental 
misjudgment solarz said he recalled that the princes alliance 
with the khmer rouge in 1970 helped transform them from regional 
guerrillas into a force that later overthrew a usbacked 
government

the gloomy and suspicious view henry kissinger 
had toward moscow lives on in the bush administration 12 years after 
he stepped down as secretary of state and as the cold war recedes 
hundreds of us and soviet nuclear missiles are being junked 
poland and hungary are veering away from marxist orthodoxy without 
any apparent interference from the kremlin and next week the two 
superpowers may announce a landmark agreement to open their chemical 
weapons plants to each other 
but before you break out the champagne and burn your blueprints 
for an air raid shelter consider what lawrence eagleburger the 
deputy secretary of state had to say the other night at georgetown 
university 
if he is right the west had better keep its guard up if he is 
wrong soviet president mikhail gorbachev could be getting a more 
cautious reception from the bush administration than he deserves 
eagleburger a foreign service officer who was close to 
kissinger has had more than 30 years of experience to sharpen his 
own perception of the soviet union and the nato alliance which was 
created on the assumption moscow menaced the west 
his speech suggests that good news can be bad news even as 
gorbachev stakes out arms control agreements with the united states 
and grafts some touches of capitalism to his creaking economy 
eagleburger finds cause for being anxious about the wests future 
he reminded his audience that the soviet leader is no 
anticommunist he intends to make the soviet union as strong as 
he possibly can eagleburger said 
as eagleburger left gunston hall he found himself facetoface 
with yuri dubinin the soviet ambassador to washington they smiled 
and exchanged pleasantries but the substance of eagleburgers 
speech was mostly hardline 
he found practical economic reasons for the cuts gorbachev is 
making in soviet weapons and for slowing overseas adventurism 
and eagleburger warned herein lies a danger to western 
interests that with the perception growing among the western 
public that the soviet threat has diminished there will be a 
tendency among the member states of the nato alliance to compete in 
expanding their relationships with the east 
that the senior us official concluded would be a mistake and 
the europeans should know better 
after all eagleburger said the europeans are condemned by 
geography to live in the shadow of soviet military power whether or 
not the soviet union in the long run changes as much as all of us 
hope 
kissinger in his day pursued as his primary foreign policy goal 
countering and hopefully shrinking soviet influence in europe the 
middle east and other regions where the two sides had not declared a 
halt to their dangerous rivalry 
the advent of gorbachev in 1985 ushered in a period of economic 
and political reform soviet troops left afghanistan barriers to 
emigration were lowered and a ban on intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles was reached with a cardcarrying anticommunist ronald 
reagan 
but eagleburger says until those changes take root it would be 
wise to avoid bankrolling merely cosmetic soviet reforms or reach 
arms control agreements which undermine natos ability to deter 
aggression 
it is not clear how pervasive this view is within the bush 
administration secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will meet next week in 
jackson hole wyo to make preparations for a superpower summit 
eagleburger is by no means suggesting summits are a bad idea but 
he says the united states and the allies should go slow in making 
deals with moscow 
we are hearing it said we need to take measures to ensure the 
success of gorbachevs reforms the deputy secretary of state 
said this however is not the task of american foreign policy 
nor should it be that of our western partners our task after all 
is to devise policies which will serve our interests whether 
gorbachev succeeds or fails

the defense department says the firing of a 
california defense contractor will delay deployment of new amraam 
airtoair missiles and force the navy to take parts from old 
missiles until a new supplier begins production 
the pentagon said thursday it dropped micronics international of 
brea calif because of years of problems with an arming and safety 
device on airtoair missiles 
the pentagon withdrew its inspectors from the micronics plant 
near los angeles and the government no longer will accept delivery 
of the safety and arming device said lt robert fallon a spokesman 
for the navy 
theres no evidence that the safety and arming device has 
caused any detrimental missile performance the navy said in a 
statement the navy has a full inventory of missiles for its 
operational forces to compensate for an expected stop in deliveries 
of the safety and arming device 
the devices will be produced by raymond engineering in 
massachusetts starting in 1991 
the missile itself is built by the hughes aircraft unit of 
general motors corp 
the troubled device will cause problems with the amraam sparrow 
and sidewinder missiles the new york times reported in todays 
editions the amraam will not be installed aboard navy f15 and air 
force f18 fighters until new parts are secured from another source 
but production problems for the sparrow and sidewinder are expected 
to be relatively minor 
the arming device roughly comparable to the safety on a gun is 
built into the missiles fuze to prevent premature firing of the 
missile it also prevents explosions in accidents such as dropping 
a warhead on a carrier deck but allows the warhead to explode when 
it hits a target after being fired 
limited production of the phoenix missile began eight years ago 
but as late as three years ago the navy disclosed it was not 
deploying the weapon because of several problems including the 
arming device in a teardown inspection of the missile in 
mid1986 the navy found 2694 defects 
last year the los angeles times reported the defense department 
was conducting a criminal investigation of micronics which was 
suspected of using a production process that does not yield the 
quality required by specifications for the arming device 
the radarguided phoenix was designed for the f14 fighter and is 
supposed to be able to hit targets 100 miles away

chief justice william h rehnquist says a new 
book on robert h borks failed supreme court nomination incorrectly 
says rehnquist broke a promise to keep justice lewis f powells 
impending retirement a secret 
author ethan bronner in his book battle for justice says 
powell told rehnquist on june 25 1987 that he would announce his 
retirement the following day and asked for a solemn promise to 
keep it a secret overnight 
the chief justice expressed his sincere regret agreed to keep 
it to himself and called white house chief of staff howard h 
baker with the news the book said it said baker immediately told 
president reagan 
that statement is in error an angry rehnquist said thursday 
i notified howard baker of the retirement shortly before we went 
on the bench on the morning of friday june 26 1987 
bronner however stuck by his story and said his taperecorded 
interview with baker supports his account of rehnquists action 
privately rehnquist has told people at the court that he is 
offended by an account that portrays him as a man who cannot be 
trusted to keep his word

food and drug administration sources say they 
expect a plan for wider distribution of a promising experimental 
aids drug known as ddi to be approved shortly 
bristolmyers co which is licensed to manufacture the drug has 
said it will distribute ddi or dideoxyinosine at no cost to aids 
patients when the next round of clinical trials begins later this 
month 
thus far the drug has been available only to about 90 patients 
in phase one clinical trials the initial safety studies 
the company has asked the fda to approve distribution of the drug 
to patients who do not qualify for the upcoming round of research 
trials which will compare ddi to azt the only approved antiaids 
drug patients who cannot tolerate azt would be ineligible for these 
trials scientists say ddi is less toxic and better tolerated by 
patients than is azt 
fda officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said thursday 
no decision has been made on precisely who would be eligible to 
receive the drug though one source said it would include certain 
patients outside clinical trials 
researchers say that like azt ddi appears to reduce replication 
of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids and controls 
the disease by enabling the body to recover some ability to fight 
infection

salvagers expect to stay offshore until 
winter recovering gold worth as much as 1 billion from a steamship 
that sank 132 years ago an expedition spokesman said 
workers recently have begun raising gold bars and coins aboard 
the ss central america a paddlewheel steamer that was traveling 
from panama to new york on sept 12 1857 when it sank during a 
hurricane 
the wreck about 200 miles off the coast in 8000 feet of water 
claimed 425 lives 153 people survived 
the golden booty includes fortunes made during the california 
gold rush said historian judy conrad of the columbus america 
discovery group which located the wreck three years ago the group 
has 106 investors mostly from ohio 
barry schatz a project director for the expedition called it 
the largest american treasure trove ever 
it sure beats working for a living he quipped via 
shiptoshore telephone thursday from aboard the recovery ship 
arctic discoverer which has been at the salvage site since july 
what was really fun was putting together the project its kind of 
scary to think beyond that 
the central america was carrying a regular monthly shipment of 
gold from the san francisco mint to new york banks via the isthmus 
of panama 
the estimated three tons of gold would be valued at up to 450 
million in todays prices 
in addition riches belonging to passengers returning east after 
making their fortunes in california appear to have been aboard the 
ship schatz said 
that billiondollar estimate is probably the most frequently 
heard figure on the treasures value said shipwreck expert e lee 
spence of sullivans island 
historians originally believed the ship sank off north carolina 
but research based largely on newspaper accounts led the columbus 
america group south 
so far about 500 pounds of gold has been recovered from the 
site schatz said the gold is being brought to the surface by an 
underwater recovery vehicle equipped with video cameras and a 
highprecision robotic arm 
gold bars one weighing 62 pounds rare double eagle coins 
valued at up to 20000 each and gold coins made by private 
california mints and valued at up to 15000 have been recovered 
said pamela adkins a spokeswoman for the expedition 
the expedition which sailed out of wilmington nc in july 
will stay at the site until winter 
schatz said the organizers believe they can recover all the gold 
from the site but said it will be later this month before they have 
a better idea as to how long that might take 
although the undisclosed location is a long way off the coast 
the wreckage is not completely undisturbed the salvagers have found 
both beer cans and garbage bags at the site schatz said

federal mine safety officials were meeting 
with executives of the company that owns the williams station mine 
when an explosion and fire there killed 10 miners an official said 
the mine safety and health administration had been investigating 
safety procedures at the mine for two or three weeks prior to the 
blast said kathy snyder of the mshas nearby madisonville office 
it was not known if the investigation had any bearing on 
wednesdays methane gas explosion about 1000 feet underground in 
the pyro mining cos mine at nearby wheatcroft 
it was the nations worst mine disaster in five years 
one miner said he and coworkers had feared a methane gas 
explosion for some time the miner spoke on condition his name not 
be used 
it could have been worse he said i expected it to be 
worse its the companys fault its the mens fault its 
everybodys involvement 
we all had the same thought on our minds he said somebody 
is going to drop the ball were just thankful its horrible its 
awful that it was just 10 men 
we all thought that when it wiped out it was going to be all 
of william station said the miner 
ed calman a spokesman for pyro said the company would have no 
comment until an investigation expected to take several weeks is 
completed 
we want to find out what happened so we can take steps to make 
sure it doesnt happen again said frank ogorman an msha 
spokesman in arlington va 
autopsies on nine of 10 miners killed in the explosion indicated 
they lived minutes at the maximum probably more like seconds 
before succumbing to superheated gases and carbon monoxide that were 
products of the blast the state medical examiner said thursday 
nine miners died at the scene of smoke inhalation and the 10th 
miner died a short time later at a hospital of carbon monoxide 
inhalation dr george nichols said at a news conference 
nichols said there was no evidence of any disabling injuries to 
anyone else at the mine which employs 367 workers on three shifts 
that indicates to me that the explosion caused a vast amount of 
carbon monoxide to be formed but not a huge concussive type of 
explosion he said 
the mine entrance remained closed and under guard thursday 
the accident claimed the highest death toll since 27 miners died 
in a utah coal mine on dec 19 1984 ogorman said

a special session of the azerbiajan supreme soviet 
today discussed the ethnic conflict engulfing the ethnic armenian 
enclave of nagornokarabakh tass reported 
the extraordinary session also was to examine draft legislation 
on the transcaucasian republics sovereignty citizenship and 
economic independence the official news agency said 
the situation in and around nagornokarabakh has never been so 
tense and explosive as today arkady volskiy head of a special 
committee ordered by the kremlin to administer the affairs of the 
autonomous region said in a television interview thursday night 
tass said that for the first time representatives of the 
peoples front of azerbaijan and other organizations were allowed to 
attend the special session 
nagornokarabakh a mountainous territory with a predominantly 
ethnic armenian population and situated within azerbaijan is the 
center of a bitter dispute between mainly christian armenia and 
predominantly moslem azerbaijan 
about 100 people have died in the ethnic strife over the past 18 
months and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes 
the peoples front is demanding that azerbaijan reassert control 
over nagornokarabakh and that direct rule by moscow be halted 
volskiy said moscow was forced to assume control of the region 
because of the bloodshed the state cannot stay aside if blood is 
spilled he said 
on thursday the newspaper pravda reported that a strike by 
azerbaijani railroad workers to press demands for azerbaijani 
control of nagornokarabakh cut vital fuel and other supplies to 
neighboring armenia 
the situation was particularly threatening in northern armenia 
where workers are trying to reconstruct cities devastated by the 
dec 7 earthquake that killed 25000 people pravda said

a former nursing home aide charged 
with suffocating five patients said she was tempted to smash 
babies at a texas hospital where she later worked her alleged 
coconspirator testified 
catherine wood the prosecutions key witness continued her 
testimony thursday in kent county circuit court in the trial of her 
former lover gwendolyn graham the trial resumes monday 
graham 25 is charged with five counts of firstdegree murder 
and one count of conspiracy to murder in the 1987 deaths of female 
patients at alpine manor nursing home in walker a suburb of grand 
rapids 
wood who has admitted helping graham kill the patients said she 
and graham sometimes talked by telephone after graham moved to her 
native tyler texas in july 1987 and began working at mother 
frances hospital as a nurses aide 
she told me she liked walking past the nursery and she wanted 
to take one of the babies and smash it against the window wood 
testified i had to stop her somehow 
her statements were made out of the presence of the jury after 
the defense attorney objected 
bobbie burks a spokeswoman at mother frances said by telephone 
that there were no unusual occurrences or unexplained injuries at 
the hospital while graham was employed there between july 1987 and 
october 1988 graham didnt have access to the nursery and was fired 
when the hospital found out she was being investigated in the alpine 
manor deaths burks said 
wood 27 has pleaded guilty to one count of seconddegree murder 
and one count of conspiracy to murder and agreed to testify against 
graham two counts of firstdegree murder were dropped 
wood testified she felt bad about the murders while they were 
occurring but went along with graham sometimes acting as a lookout 
while graham smothered the patients with rolledup washcloths 
the two split in july 1987 after living together for nearly a 
year and graham moved to tyler with another nurses aide 
defense attorney james piazza said wood made up the slayings 
because she was hurt and angry that graham had left her for another 
woman 
dawn male a former nurses aide at alpine who said she had 
sexual relationships with both wood and graham testified thursday 
that graham admitted suffocating a patient with a pillow while wood 
kept watch 
when the five patients died between jan 18 and april 7 1987 
their deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed 
police began investigating after woods exhusband told them she had 
confessed to him 
kent county medical examiner stephen cohle testified thursday he 
performed autopsies on two patients whose bodies were exhumed in 
november he said he changed the cause of death on their death 
certificates from heart disease to asphyxia due to suffocation 
primarily because of police reports 
cohle said he could find no physical evidence of suffocation nor 
could he find a physiological reason for their sudden deaths 
the alleged victims were belle burkhard 74 marguerite chambers 
60 myrtle luce 95 mae mason 79 and edith cook 97 
if convicted graham faces a mandatory life sentence wood could 
receive parole in 10 years on the lesser charges

consistently refused to comment on whether it is developing nuclear 
weapons or missiles 
in july 1987 radio moscows hebrewlanguage service accused 
israel of developing a nuclearcapable missile reportedly called 
the jerichoii 
the genevabased international defense review reported then that 
israel successfully fired a missile into the mediterranean and that 
it flew 520 miles the missiles projected range was said to be as 
much as 920 miles 
two years before the soviet radio report the british magazine

back he said 
earlier this week prime minister rajiv gandhi visited her the

was permitted to film the 10minute chat 
what can the hospital management do if the prime minister the 
chief minister of west bengal state the health minister and other 
dignitaries keep coming to visit said the doctor

attending mother teresa that coordination of treatment had become a 
problem

again in the afternoon 
mother teresa has had a setback dr kk sinha a 
cardiologist and one of her five doctors said thursday night 
there is a heaviness in the chest this is very serious

appeared to mean a form of heart attack an infarction refers to an 
area of dying or dead tissue resulting from the obstruction of blood 
vessels a myocardial infarction which is death of a section of 
heart muscle is a heart attack 
very aggressive treatment is needed he said all 
medication has been given but she is allergic to some medicine 
dozens of people of all faiths waited outside the hospital some 
kneeling at the gate to offer prayers bouquets of flowers sent from 
wellwishers around the world were delivered to the home 
mother teresa suffered a heart attack sept 8 three days after 
she was admitted to the intensive care unit with an irregular 
heartbeat a blocked artery and high fever 
doctors said her condition progressively improved after they 
attached a temporary pacemaker and changed her medication they had 
hoped to remove the pacemaker by the end of the week but her 
condition deteriorated early thursday 
born in yugoslavia mother teresa gave up a comfortable life as a 
convent teacher to live and work among the destitute and dying in 
calcuttas squalid slums 
she founded the missionaries of charity in october 1950 in an 
abandoned rundown hostel donated by the city the order which was

former president jimmy carter fresh from 
sponsoring talks to end a rebellion in ethiopia is off to nicaragua 
to prepare for elections that could lead to a definitive end to that 
countrys war 
carter whose activities in panama and africa this year have 
given him a more visible role in world affairs than at any time 
since he left the white house in 1981 will use the visit to prepare 
for his role as an observer of nicaraguas feb 25 presidential 
elections 
peace talks that began sept 7 between the ethiopian government 
and the eritrean peoples liberation front at the carter center may 
conclude today or adjourn until tuesday when carter returns from 
nicaragua said center spokeswoman carrie harmon 
acting as a private citizen though with the blessing of 
washington carter has used his public policy facility and think 
tank as a force to boost talks to end various regional conflicts 
in nicaragua as in panama carter will be representing the 
council of freely elected heads of government a group of current 
and former democratically elected chiefs of state 
carter was an observer at the may elections in panama 
afterwards his accusations of fraud against defacto military 
leader gen manuel noriega received widespread attention 
over the past two weeks carter has served as host and observer 
for preliminary discussions aimed at setting an agenda for talks to 
end the 28yearold war between ethiopia and the eritrean rebels in 
the horn of africa 
i think i can say without contradiction from washington that 
they do indeed support my trip to nicaragua carter told reporters 
in a briefing during the ethiopian talks but i will emphasize 
again this is not a duty designated to me by the bush 
administration 
harmon said carters visit this weekend will include meetings 
with members of nicaraguas supreme electoral board government 
officials opposition leaders and representatives of church and 
civic groups 
president daniel ortega is expected to run for reelection in 
election against violeta barrios de chamorro the director of the 
opposition newspaper la prensa and candidate of the 14party 
opposition coalition 
carter said his continued involvement in world matters is being 
conducted by a concerned citizen not by a man interested in 
resurrecting a political career 
you know ive got a lot of things i could be doing carter 
told reporters last week using the ethiopiaeritrea talks as an 
example and i dont have any personal thing to gain from spending 
days or weeks or whatever trying to bring peace to the people of 
ethiopia and eritrea 
but i look upon this as one of the most terrible conflicts in 
the world and the fact that both sides are at least going to have 
goodfaith negotiations has already been proven to me and i 
think warrants my investment of time carter said

military officials are 
trying to pinpoint the malfunction that forced the destruction of an 
mx missile making the systems first test as an operational weapon 
system 
the mx missile was destroyed three minutes into flight thursday 
the third failure in a new generation of us nuclear missiles since 
march 
a team of air force and department of defense contractor 
engineers is analyzing data from the flight to analyze the cause of 
the anomaly said air force tech sgt ernest dawson after they 
have complete their tests the air force will determine if any 
system modifications are necessary to correct or improve the 
peacekeeper weapon system 
the 75 million mx was destroyed by a signal sent by western test 
range safety officers after telemetry indicated a problem aboard the 
fourstage intercontinental ballistic missile 
the launch was under control of a 44person task force from fe 
warren air force base wyoming and overseen by lt col robert cook 
commander of the 90th organizational missile maintenance squadron 
fifty mx missiles are deployed at warren located near cheyenne 
three mx missiles were scheduled to undergo similar tests next 
year it was not immediately known how or if thursdays missile 
failure might affect that schedule 
it was the mx systems first operational test under the strategic 
air command nine dummy reentry vehicle warheads were to be 
delivered to various targets 4700 miles to the southwest in the 
kwajalein missile range the mx is capable of carrying 10 warheads 
eighteen previous tests of the mx or socalled peacekeeper 
missile were termed developmental thursdays was the first that 
had to be destroyed 
in march the navys newest and most powerful weapon a 237 
million trident 2 missile was destroyed seconds after an undersea 
launch from a submarine off the florida coast the missile spun 
wildly before destruction 
the first launch of the air forces midgetman missile in may 
ended in failure when it began tumbling 70 seconds into flight

residents rushed back to basement bomb 
shelters today when syrian and christian gunners shelled the city 
hours after arab league mediators concluded talks aimed at ending 
the fighting 
police said five people were killed and seven wounded in the 
exchanges which occurred residential districts in the citys moslem 
and christian sectors as well as the wooded mountains southeast of 
the capital 
the latest casualties raised the toll to 900 killed and 2559 
wounded since march 8 when the current round of violence broke out 
pitting gen michel aouns mainly christian troops against syrian 
and allied forces 
the duel started shortly after the foreign ministers of saudi 
arabia morocco and algeria ended two days of talks in the saudi red 
sea port of jiddah late thursday without issuing a ceasefire call 
the three ministers in a brief statement said only that they 
conducted a necessary evaluation of the situation in lebanon and 
considered the possibility of new moves 
the statement said king fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of 
morocco and algerian president chadli bendjedid will release an 
official statement saturday about the outcome of the committees 
efforts 
the syrianchristian duel forced the few citizens remaining in 
beirut to rush to basements and underground shelters to escape the 
barrage shattering hopes that a relative lull in the fighting would 
continue 
the exchanges had sharply diminished thursday and wednesday while 
the arab league members met local newspapers had predicted a 
ceasefire in the confrontation between aouns 20000 soldiers and 
the 40000 syrian troops 
we were under the impression that this shelling was over at 
least for the time being said rashid makkouk a sunni moslem 
resident of west beiruts bourj abu haidar district 
after hearing the talks produced no agreement makkouk said at 
the entrance to his shellscarred apartment building i was 
wondering whether we should return to the shelter when the explosion 
of the first shell echoed we rushed down 
the shelling began in march over a blockade by aoun of illegal 
ports run by syrias militia allies south of beirut aoun sought to 
reimpose government control on the ports 
syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling and besieging the 
310squaremile christian enclave aouns power base northeast of 
beirut

a genetically engineered vaccine that protects 
monkeys against an aidslike virus could help in the search for a 
way to shield humans from aids says a developer of the vaccine 
the findings offer hope that similar methodologies might lead 
to an effective vaccine against aids in humans shiulok hu 
leader of the team that tested the vaccine said thursday 
but he cautioned that the monkey virus differs from the humans 
aids virus and that there were no immediate implications for aids 
patients 
the virus simian acquired immunodeficiency virus type d or 
saids d is an oftenfatal aidslike disease in monkeys hu said 
the research team including scientists of the university of 
washington the national cancer institute and oncogen a seattle 
biotechnology company announced their findings at a news conference 
at the universitys health sciences center the results of their 
yearlong study will be reported in this months proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences 
four vaccinated macaque monkeys exposed to the saids d virus have 
remained healthy and free of the virus while three of four 
unvaccinated monkeys in the study developed signs of infection 
within two weeks after exposure to the virus 
we believe this is the first live recombinant vaccine that 
protects primates against a retrovirus that causes aidslike 
diseases said william morton supervisory veterinarian at the 
university of washingtons regional primate research center and an 
author of the paper 
the fourth unvaccinated animal did not become infected 
consistent with reports showing that for undetermined reasons some 
monkeys are resistant to infection the scientists said 
the genetically constructed vaccine called vsenv5 combines 
part of the protein coat of the saids d virus with the vaccinia 
virus which has been used successfully to eradicate smallpox 
the four vaccinated monkeys received two immunizations 16 weeks 
apart twelve weeks after the second immunizations all eight 
animals in the study including the four nonvaccinated monkeys 
were exposed to the saids d virus 
the four vaccinated animals developed antibodies to the specific 
proteins used in the vaccine proving that the monkeys immune 
response was triggered by the vaccine and not by exposure to the 
saids d virus itself the researchers said 
last month harvard university researchers working with monkeys 
reported they had protected monkeys from a similar simian aids 
virus in that study the monkeys were given a killedvirus vaccine 
rather than a live recombinant vaccine said hu director of 
vaccine research at oncogen 
hu said the live virus vaccine elicits an immune response more 
closely akin to that obtained from a natural infection 
hu stressed that both approaches were important and could be used 
in efforts to develop a vaccine against aids

pakistan will rejoin the british 
commonwealth next month after a 17year absence and will attend next 
months annual meeting here commonwealth secretarygeneral sir 
shridath ramphal said today 
ramphal said in a statement that at pakistans request he carried 
out consultations over the past few months with member states of the 
londonbased commonwealth which includes britain and its former 
colonies 
the commonwealth had responded with unanimity to the wish of 
the democratically elected government of pakistan to rejoin the 
commonwealth the statement quoted him as saying referring to the 
election of prime minister benazir bhutto in december that ended 11 
years of military rule 
it was ms bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto 
who in 1972 pulled the country out of the commonwealth when members 
britain canada and australia recognized the breakaway state of 
bangladesh formerly east pakistan pakistan hinted it wanted to 
rejoin the commonwealth in the early 1980s commonwealth sources 
say but the question was shelved because india which sided with 
bangladesh in its fight for independence did not express support 
however india indicated after ms bhuttos election as prime 
minister that it would have no objection 
beginning oct 1 pakistan will be the 49th member of the group 
said ramphal who is from guyana 
there could hardly be a more auspicious prelude to the kuala 
lumpur meeting later in october he added 
ms bhutto is expected to attend the commonwealth heads of 
government meeting to be held in the malaysian capital oct 1824

cleanup workers and state officials say 
theres still plenty of oil fouling the shores of prince william 
sound but exxon insists the beaches are nearly free of oil as a 
summerlong effort ends 
exxon officials pronounced the 1100 miles of oiltainted 
shoreline environmentally stable thursday and proclaimed their 
25week cleanup of the nations worst oil spill a job well done 
exxon corp chairman lawrence rawl said in juneau that the 
affected shores of the sound and gulf of alaska farther south are 
certainly what most people would call clean 
but dennis kelso the states environmental commissioner was not 
pleased with what he saw when he toured shorelines on two islands 
south of valdez on thursday 
this beach is not environmentally stable he said as he poked 
a stick into thickly oiled rocks on knight island if we had 
wildlife here theyd be pretty heavily oiled 
exxon officials said they expect to declare the summer cleanup 
complete today 25 weeks after the tanker exxon valdez cracked open 
on a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil the 
company has said a sept 15 deadline to wrap up the work was set 
because the weather gets rough and days get so short this time of 
year in alaska 
but state officials are pressuring exxon to commit to a greater 
research effort over the winter to determine the best way to resume 
the cleanup next spring 
the point isnt that exxon has done a terrible job kelso 
said theres just more to be done we dont need to wait until 
spring to get the preparations going 
i think theyre looking to get out of it and i think theyre 
trying to put the best face on it that they possibly can kelso 
said this morning on the nbc today program in terms of 
honesty with the american people i think they get a failing grade 
the company has said that about 300 cleanup workers would remain 
in alaska to monitor the spill and respond to major problems at the 
height of the effort about 10000 people were working on the 
cleanup 
otto harrison general manager of exxons valdez operations said 
that while oil remained in some areas it wasnt enough to harm 
wildlife 
what youve seen is a coastline almost free of oil harrison 
said youre seeing the steady recovery of prince william sound 
state officials agreed exxons efforts had resulted in some 
cleaner shorelines but disputed the companys rosy portrayal of an 
environmental rebound 
on his tour of the knight island shoreline kelso noted there 
were few signs of wildlife on what once was a shore rich with the 
sounds of life 
kelso said a chemical fertilizer recently sprayed on the rocks 
showed signs of breaking down the oil in some areas 
in other spots however it appeared the cleanup was rushed to 
meet exxons selfimposed deadline kelso said 
on green island kelso used a pocket knife to scrape sunbaked 
oil off blackened rocks 
it looks and feels like tar the way an asphalt driveway 
feels he said 
gov steve cowper scheduled a news conference in valdez today to 
discuss the states cleanup plans for the winter 
cleanup workers returned to valdez by the hundreds thursday on 
their way home many echoed the sentiments of roger consiel who was 
on the first crew of 48 workers dispatched to the oiled beaches 
after the march 24 grounding of the oil tanker 
i think we did some good he said but the oils going to 
be there for a while thats for sure 
i think exxon should come back next year theres a lot left to 
be done 
consiel 39 was an unemployed cannery worker when an exxon 
contractor hired him for cleanup duty he returns home to his family 
with about 30000 in spill wages in his savings account 
not bad for 5 months work he said with a smile im 
pretty happy about it it would be nice to come back next year 
too 
some fishermen who suffered from a restricted salmon season and a 
poor catch say the sound will never be the same 
its time that everyone realizes that no amount of money in the 
world is going to restore prince william sound to a pristine 
condition said riki ott of cordova district fishermen united

anheuserbusch must pay 1 million in fines 
for illegally discharging phosphoruscontaminated water into the 
seneca river officials said 
the beer maker also admitted its employees reported false 
sampling data to the state department of environmental conservation 
and hid from dec inspectors hoses that illegally bypassed critical 
portions of the waste water treatment system 
in an agreement disclosed thursday the st louisbased brewer 
agreed to pay a 925000 civil fine for unlawful discharges into the 
seneca river from its plant in baldwinsville ny said new york 
attorney general robert abrams 
on wednesday night the company pleaded guilty in lysander town 
court to three misdemeanor violations of the states water pollution 
control regulations and was fined 75000 
the company also agreed to publish fullpage advertisements in 
four waste water treatment trade publications advising other 
corporations to comply with state environmental standards in 
addition the company will undergo an independent audit of its 
treatment plant operations 
walter a suhre jr vice president and general counsel for 
anheuserbusch said three employees were responsible for the 
pollution violations and acted without the consent or knowledge of 
the company two were fired and one was allowed to resign he said 
we are a highly regulated industry and we do not accept any 
excuse not to adhere to the law said suhre 
criminal charges could be brought against individuals involved in 
the pollution and coverup abrams said but he declined to identify 
those under investigation 
the pollution had no permanent environmental impact but may have 
contributed to an overall lessening of water quality in the river 
said state environmental conservation commissioner thomas jorling 
excessive amounts of phosphorus can result in weed and algae growth 
that can hinder the development of fish and other aquatic life 
suhre said no completely untreated waste was discharged directly 
into the river 
the dec investigation stemmed from a tip from a fired employee 
the state officials charged that anheuserbusch treatment plant 
employees began submitting false monitoring reports on discharges 
into the seneca river in 1982

a roman catholic newspaper in rep barney franks 
congressional district wants him to resign but the massachusetts 
democrat said he wont because that would leave accusations about 
him unanswered 
frank has been embroiled in controversy since acknowledging he 
paid a male prostitute for sex and then hired him as a valet 
the prostitute stephen gobie said frank knew he used the 
congressmans apartment in a prostitution ring frank denied it and 
said he fired gobie when he found out about it 
the call for frank to step down came in an editorial in the 
anchor the 29000circulation newspaper of the roman catholic 
diocese of fall river 
if he were a policeman a school teacher or fireman he would 
be out of a job the rev john f moore editor of the anchor 
wrote in an editorial dated sept 8 his rather tacky double 
standard should not be condoned or excused 
but frank said thursday a resignation would shortcircuit the 
house ethics committee and i think the committee is an 
appropriate forum

east germanys hardline 
leadership today rejected calls for reforms to halt the flow of its 
citizens to the west but for the first time said the exodus of 
skilled workers will hurt the economy 
also today the communist government canceled a planned visit by 
a delegation from the leftleaning west german opposition party the 
social democrats 
the number of refugees reaching west germany neared 14000 today 
and budapest vowed to keep its borders open for east germans heading 
west 
several times in the past few days west german chancellor helmut 
kohl has urged the east german leadership to make political and 
economic improvements to curb the number of refugees the social 
democrats have also called for reforms 
but guenter mittag the central committee member in charge of the 
east german economy rejected those calls in a commentary today in 
the communist party daily newspaper neues deutschland 
the reform proposals of those people contain only one point 
they want the type of reform that does away with socialism mittag 
wrote thanks a lot for that it just wont be that way 
mittag also accused west germany of causing the exodus with 
promises enticements and also with psychological pressure he 
called on those left behind to do everything possible to strengthen 
the nation of 166 million people 
neues deutschland expressed its thanks and joy for thursdays 
announcement that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will visit 
east berlin for the nations 40th anniversary celebrations on oct 7 
east german leader erich honecker has vigorously rejected calls 
for the kind of reforms gorbachev advocates for the soviet bloc 
soviet politburo member yegor ligachev said in berlin that moscow 
is east germanys loyal friend and accused west german 
politicians and news media of mounting a tendentious campaign 
against east germany 
most of the current wave of east german refugees are young people 
who have turned their back on the political repression and economic 
difficulties in their home country many are skilled workers leaving 
behind a huge hole in their nations work force 
harry tisch a central committee member who heads the staterun 
labor union in east germany acknowledged that the government would 
have to find solutions to bridge this gap 
it certainly wont be easy tisch said during a visit to 
stuttgart naturally its not unproblematical for us that young 
skilled workers from the german democratic republic are resettling 
in the federal republic of germany 
according to statistics released thursday by the west german 
government east germany is suffering its biggest talent drain from 
the nations work force since the berlin wall went up in 1961 
the ministry report said 55 percent of the refugees who have come 
to west germany since august are between 18 and 30 years of age it 
said 86 percent had successfully completed high levels of job 
training 
the figures compiled from information provided by the newcomers 
during registration after arrival indicate that 33 percent had been 
employed in heavy industry and 25 percent in the service sector 
where shortages already had been reported according to the report 
most had occupied middlelevel positions 
the east german leadership has been hampered by honeckers 
protracted recovery from gallbladder surgery last month leading one 
communist party official to call the country a ship without a 
captain but tisch told the news conference today that honecker 
was on the way to recovery 
in east berlin parliament president horst sindermann announced 
that the communist government had canceled the opposition social 
democrats visit that had been scheduled for next week 
sindermann accused the party which routinely strives for better 
ties to east germany of planning a confrontation with the 
communist government 
chancellor helmut kohls conservative christian democrats had 
already bitterly criticized plans for the trip saying the social 
democrats should avoid the appearance of showing support for the 
communist governments rigid stance

hungary decided to let east germans flee 
to the west because budapest is more committed to westernstyle 
reforms than to an appearance of east bloc unity a deputy foreign 
minister said 
laszlo kovacs said hungary will not sacrifice measures held to 
be important by us in the light of a possible disagreement by one of 
our allies his comments were published today by the staterun mti 
news agency and the newspaper magyar hirlap 
east germany has lashed out at hungary for opening its border to 
thousands of east germans fleeing to the west the border has been 
open since sunday and about 14000 east germans have emigrated 
since then 
about 500 more east germans arrived in west germany today after 
passing through austria overnight authorities said 
east germany today rejected calls for reforms to halt the flow of 
its citizens to the west but it also acknowledged for the first 
time that the exodus of skilled workers will hurt the economy 
guenter mittag the east german official in charge of the 
economy said in the state newspaper neues deutschland that west 
german calls for reform in east germany contain only one point 
they want the type of reform that does away with socialism 
thanks a lot for that it just wont be that way mittag 
wrote 
harry tisch a central committee member who heads the staterun 
labor union said on a visit to stuttgart that the government would 
have to find solutions to the problem of losing many young skilled 
workers 
magyar hirlap also reported today that dozens of romanians and 
czechoslovaks are caught each night trying to slip across hungarys 
border with austria austrian border police in the state of 
burgenland said an equal number make it across each night 
the border police said 40 romanians and five czechoslovaks 
arrived before dawn today 
the new escape route has prompted east germans in poland and 
czechoslovakia to seek refuge in west german embassies in hopes they 
also will be able to go west 
west german foreign ministry officials said today that 60 east 
germans are at the embassy in warsaw and about 190 in prague 
a west german border police spokesman klaus papenfuss said 273 
of the new arrivals today registered with camps set up near passau 
and the rest continued by train to other refugee centers set up in 
the central part of the country 
papenfuss said in a statement that seven more busloads of east 
germans were expected to arrive today 
the east germans are automatically granted citizenship in west 
germany and have been given assistance finding housing and jobs 
kovacs said hugarys decision to let the refugees go is in 
accordance with international norms and regulations on human rights 
thereby proving the consistency of hungarian politics the 
commitment of the countrys leadership in accomplishing the reform 
process 
asked if hungary felt a triangle of eastbloc allies was 
forming against the reformist state kovacs replied it is true 
that hungarys relations with these countries have become tense 
he referred to ties with czechoslovakia and romania as well as east 
germany 
hungary and poland have led the soviet bloc in carrying out 
social and political reforms but east germany romania and 
czechoslovakia have resisted 
hungary has alienated czechoslovakia by denouncing the 1968 
warsaw pact invasion of that country and by pulling out of a 
controversial danube dam project romania is angry with hungary over 
budapests decision to give refuge to 20000 romanians of hungarian 
descent who have fled illegally 
kovacs said the strains with the three countries are unusual 
and call for concern but he did not elaborate 
west germanys ard television network said there were rumors 
hungary would close the border soon but hungarian government 
spokesman zsolt bajnok said he knew of no such plans 
bajnok quoted foreign minister gyula horn as saying thursday that 
no decision has been made on stopping the flow of east germans 
ferenc somogyi hungarian secretary of state for foreign affairs 
said in an interview published today we will leave the border 
open as long as we judge it necessary 
i assure you that all east germans in hungary will have the 
opportunity to leave the country the paris newspaper le figaro 
quoted him as saying in budapest the article did not give the date 
of his comments but did refer to events wednesday 
east germany has accused hungary of breaking a 1969 agreement 
prohibiting unauthorized departures to the west of residents of the 
warsaw pact countries and it filed a formal protest tuesday 
a soviet politburo member said thursday that moscow is east 
germanys loyal friend and president mikhail s gorbachev plans 
to visit the troubled communist state next month east germanys

former hud secretary samuel pierce did not 
appear today as scheduled before a house subcommittee investigating 
scandals at his department and the panels chairman said he would 
seek a subpoena to compel his testimony 
while he may run he may not hide chairman tom lantos said 
of pierce who on thursday evening abruptly canceled plans to 
testify on grounds he had not had time to prepare because he had 
only recently hired an attorney 
lantos dcalif began todays hearing by attacking that 
argument and pierces tenure at the department of housing and urban 
development during the reagan administration i can understand not 
being able to find affordable housing in washington but not an 
attorney he said 
lantos said he would ask his house government operations housing 
and employment subcommittee to vote next wednesday on a subpoena 
that would require pierce to testify at several future hearings 
the ranking republican on the subcommittee also attacked pierces 
decision not only is silent sam silent apparently today hes 
also invisible said rep donald buz lukens rohio 
in a statement thursday night pierce said he was willing to 
testify at an appropriate time and accused thwe subcommittee of 
unfairly denying his request for an extension 
i will not voluntarily appear the former housing and urban 
development secretary said i have fully and completely cooperated 
with the subcommittee right up until today but its refusal to allow 
me an additional two weeks preparation time when numerous other 
witnesses have been granted even longer postponements simply is 
unfair 
the panel is investigating allegations that prominent republicans 
and former hud officials won favored treatment from the agency 
during pierces eight years as secretary and that poor management 
left hud unable to account for hundreds of millions of dollars 
opening the hearing today lantos said mr pierce has chosen 
in a unilateral and arbitrary fashion to break a firm agreement i 
made with him and his attorney to appear voluntarily at this 
hearing 
he then referred to a letter from pierces hud file in which 
former interior secretary james watt referred to pierce as a man 
of your word 
regrettably that statement appears to apply only to mod rehab 
units lantos said referring to watts work as a consultant for 
developers who sought federal contracts for work under huds 
moderate rehabilitation program 
subcommittee member barney frank dmass referred to a house 
ethics investigation he faces because of a relationship with a male 
prostitute in criticizing pierce for refusing to appear today 
frank who requested the ethics review and has made several 
public statements since word of the relationship surfaced last 
month said that when the conduct of public officials is questioned 
the public is entitled to the promptest possible resolution of 
those issues before the appropriate public body 
pierces attorney paul perito said in an interview mr 
pierce wants to tell his entire story however he needs to be 
adequately prepared to do so 
pierces announcement was the latest twist in an investigation 
that already has seen two former top pierce aides at hud assert 
their fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination and refuse 
to testify before the subcommittee 
pierce appeared voluntarily in may and said he took no direct 
role in hud funding decisions but his sworn testimony was 
challenged by a former hud official who said pierce personally 
ordered her to fund a 15 million durham nc project that was 
opposed by several agency experts 
the project was supported by charles markham then the citys 
mayor and a former law partner of pierces the developer also hired 
as a consultant lou kitchin who was southeastern political director 
of the reagan and bush presidential campaigns 
pierce also has been criticized for lifting restrictions on a hud 
lender whose portfolio now includes more than 538 million in 
defaults pierce made the decision after being lobbied by former hud 
secretary carla hills now the bush administrations trade 
representative the company drg funding corp is the target of an 
fbi investigation 
those and other accounts of pierces actions at hud had left the 
subcommittee eager to question him several members have stopped 
just short of accusing pierce of committing perjury in may when he 
said he was not a hands on manager 
in his statement pierce himself an attorney said he required 
legal counsel because it had become apparent to him that the 
subcommittee had dropped its nonadversarial manner 
pierce said he was unable to retain competent counsel until last 
week and had far too little time to review documents 
one would think that common courtesy and basic fairness demand 
that the subcommittee grant to any citizen it called before it 
sufficient time to consult counsel and prepare testimony pierce 
said stressing that he is willing to appear voluntarily at a later 
date 
but lantos obviously angered by pierces eleventhhour 
announcement said all further appearances by sam pierce will 
take place on a compelled basis under subpoena

a senior administration official seeking to 
deflect criticism of its handling of soviet refugees said today the 
united states was doing all it can to admit as many as possible but 
its capabilities are limited 
we are trying to manage the surge in soviet emigration in the 
most humane and orderly way possible said deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger 
testifying before the senate subcommittee on immigration 
eagleburger said that while the united states applauds the recent 
liberalization of soviet emigration we must be honest in 
appraising our national ability to respond to unprecedented 
unpredictable and previously unmanaged flows of people 
republican sen orrin g hatch of utah was sharply critical of 
the administrations position no budget deficit however large 
should ever induce the united states to abandon or compromise in any 
way its fundamental values of granting haven to oppressed 
peoples he said 
many members of congress have criticized the strategy for dealing 
with soviet refugees saying the united states is limiting their 
entry instead of opening its arms to the unprecedented wave of 
emigres 
just when the soviet faucets start opening the us government 
finds itself totally incapable of dealing with the results it has 
been pressing so many years to achieve said rep benjamin gilman 
rny we look like laughingstocks to the soviets and like fools 
to the emigres 
in an effort to deflect some of the criticism attorney general 
dick thornburgh on thursday ordered the immigration and 
naturalization service to reconsider the applications of 4000 
soviets whose bid for refugee status were denied by ins examiners in 
rome 
the ins will consider whether the soviets who are mostly jews 
would be subjected to persecution if they were forced to return to 
their homeland the justice department said 
this standard will be used in evaluating the applications of some 
16000 soviets in rome who are also seeking us refugee status 
said a justice department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
i am aware of and sensitive to the great chorus of concern 
which has been expressed for these persons thornburgh said 
the bush administration said this week it plans to limit the 
number of soviet refugees admitted to this country to 50000 in the 
coming fiscal year as many as 150000 are expected to apply in 
fiscal 1990 
princeton lyman director of refugee programs at the state 
department told a joint hearing of two house panels that once the 
administration handles the backlog of applicants from this fiscal 
year estimated at more than 50000 there will not be any slots 
left for new applicants in fiscal 1990 
the administration should just hang up a sign in moscow telling 
people not to bother applying in 1990 said rep howard berman 
dcalif why establish elaborate processing procedures when no one 
will be admitted anyway 
jewel lafontant the administrations coordinator for refugee 
affairs told panel members that we share your frustration we 
dont have all the answers but were working darned hard to find 
them 
two pending bills would require the administration to 
automatically grant refugee status to all soviet emigres on the 
grounds that they face persecution as a group 
all soviets were granted refugee status until summer 1988 when 
former attorney general edwin meese ordered that each applicant be 
required to prove persecution on an individual basis 
this change resulted in 20 to 50 percent of applicants being 
turned down us officials said thursday 
berman released an internal state department report that said 
widespread antisemitism in the lower ranks of soviet government and 
among the general populace has increased greatly under glasnost 
statesponsored antisemitism official policy for hundreds of 
years has abated although many cases are still reported the 
report said 
the jewish community expressed its concern with the new 
administration strategy at separate white house and state department 
meetings at the state department leaders of five american jewish 
groups gave the administration the names of 400 jewish families who 
have been denied exit permits 
the issue will be discussed later this month in wyoming when 
secretary of state james a baker iii meets with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
also on the wyoming agenda is a us request to increase its 
embassy staff in moscow to deal with the number of soviet applicants 
seeking entry into the united states 
the administrations new proposal would provide full federal 
sponsorship for 40000 soviet refugees while private organizations 
would finance the resettlement for the remaining 10000 
it also would allow as many as 30000 soviets to come here under 
a special parole category if they can find the money for their 
travel and resettlement 
to save money the state department announced it will close 
processing centers for soviet emigres in italy and austria and 
handle all processing in moscow with a new facility in washington to 
help with the caseload

security forces throughout china today began 
making spot checks of citizens identification cards in another move 
by the government to regain a degree of control over the population 
also today the official press said in frontpage editorials that 
the sacking of a provincial governor accused of corruption shows the 
communist party will spare no high official found abusing his powers 
a measure similar to the id card checks was instituted sept 1 in 
beijing which is under martial law in an effort to round up 
alleged counterrevolutionaries still at large three months after the 
army crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
no mention was made of the counterrevolutionaries when 
authorities announced today that nationwide checks would begin 
instead the public security ministry said the checking is 
aimed at providing convenience for citizens in their political 
economic and other activities guaranteeing their legal rights and 
strengthening the administration and protection of the social 
order 
other measures are reported to have been implemented to clear 
beijing of nonresidents before the capital celebrates the 40th 
anniversary of communist china on oct 1 authorities appear 
concerned that students and others who joined the popular movement 
this spring might stage some kind of protest on national day 
chinese say notices have gone up in some work units ordering 
those without papers authorizing them to live permanently in beijing 
to leave by today only those with written permission from 
authorities above the provincial level to do business in the capital 
are allowed to remain 
hong kong newspapers have reported restrictions on travel to 
beijing but government offices in a number of large chinese cities 
denied any knowledge of such regulations 
the beijing foreign affairs office which handles questions from 
foreign reporters also said they were not aware of any travel 
restrictions 
but beijing railroad station is comparatively empty chinas 
busiest railroad station usually is teeming with people with 
virtually every bit of open space taken up by travelers who have 
camped out while waiting sometimes for several days to buy tickets 
chinese say strict security before oct 1 is normal but many 
also say it has never been this strict 
the id checks have scared away some of beijings transient 
population of about 700000 most of them peasants from the 
countryside working at construction sites selling vegetables 
working as maids and doing other manual labor that city residents 
disdain 
the new measures are a turnaround from a gradual loosening of 
restrictions on movement in the past 10 years in the past a person 
needed approval from several different government offices to leave 
his village 
in recent years however traveling became much easier and often 
the only restriction was cost the domestic tourism industry boomed 
as chinese with money set about seeing chinas famous sites 
hainan governor liang xiangs dismissal announced wednesday 
completely expresses our party and governments determination and 
courage to punish corruption the workers daily said 
liang governor since august of chinas newest and most open 
province was accused of aiding his wife and sons in real estate and 
auto speculation illegally letting one of his sons settle in hong 
kong and using public funds to buy clothes and hold banquets 
he is the highest ranking government official to fall since the 
beginning of a campaign against corruption sparked in part by the 
crushed student demonstrations of last spring which made a major 
issue of public corruption 
the 71yearold liang was closely associated with the reformist 
policies of zhao ziyang who was purged from power and accused of 
supporting student dissent but hainan communist party chief xu 
shijie was quoted as saying liangs fall was not a political matter 
connected to zhao

public defender lori barrist who represented comas 
three of comas sisters who live in miami also indicated their 
brother had history of mental illness said ms barrist 
the united states has long accused cuban leader fidel castro of 
using the mariel boatlift as an excuse to send prisoners and mental 
patients to the united states along with the thousands of 
lawabiding cubans seeking to escape castros rule 
comas boarded an american flight in los angeles and changed to a 
miamibound plane in dallas on the ninth anniversary of his flight

used in athletic events the pistol was not discovered by detection 
devices in los angeles or dallas

a former unisys corp executive who 
admitted creating a slush fund to bribe officials and make illegal 
campaign contributions received a 32month sentence today for his 
role in the pentagon procurement scandal 
charles f gardner 58 was also fined 40000 for what the 
prosecutor called improper conduct that was a qualitative 
quantitative leap from what has been before this court in a string 
of other defense procurement criminal cases 
james g neal a former consultant to unisys who admitted helping 
gardner bribe a navy official for sensitive bid information on a 
government contract received a 27month sentence and was fined 
30000 
gardner who admitted bribing former pentagon official melvyn 
paisley by purchasing paisleys ski resort condominium for an 
inflated price was described by assistant us attorney joseph 
aronica as a major figure in this investigation 
but aronica citing gardners cooperation with the continuing 
investigation since his march 10 guilty plea joined the defense in 
urging us district judge claude hilton to show some degree of 
leniency 
defense attorney gary naftalis said gardners cooperation had 
already led to six guilty pleas and will lead to more and more 
convictions of individuals and corporations 
gardner apparently is providing information to prosecutors about 
the role of his former superiors at sperry corp which became 
unisys corp following a takeover by burroughs corp 
unisys says it is also cooperating with the probe nicknamed 
operation ill wind 
according to court papers in another case gardner obtained 
approval from a superior to bribe a former navy engineer garland l 
tomlin jr who is awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea for taking 
400000 from the company and 75000 from honeywell inc for bid 
information 
hilton said gardner was more culpable than the defendants that 
have been previously before me to be sentenced but the judge said 
he recognized the extent of the cooperation that gardner had 
given prosecutors 
because of that cooperation hilton agreed to depart from 
sentencing guidelines which called for a prison term ranging 
between 46 and 57 months 
many of the previous defendants sentenced by hilton in the case 
had received sentences of about 24 to 25 months 
aronica said gardner created a slush fund to finance a broad 
spectrum of criminal activity 
it was the american taxpayer that ended up footing the bill for 
these activities because gardner billed the pentagon to replenish 
the slush fund by filing phony invoices 
gardners concern about preserving government contracts for 
unisys by paying bribes and making illegal campaign contributions 
can in no way excuse or lessen the severity of what he directed 
and orchestrated aronica said 
aronica described neal as the banker for mr gardner and mr 
gardners operation but neal knew what was going on with the 
money that he placed in various accounts for the slush fund aronica 
said 
his involvement was as serious or more serious than those 
previously sentenced by this court aronica told hilton 
according to court papers gardner arranged in 1986 to have neal 
purchase paisleys condominium in sun valley idaho at a price that 
was 49000 above what he sold it for a year later 
paisley former assistant navy secretary for research 
engineering and systems has not been charged in the case 
neal who also pleaded guilty march 10 admitted transferring 
400000 to the bahamas account of a company tomlin set up in order 
to influence decisions on the navy contract

four bombs exploded at banks in bogota 
today as colombia prepared to extradite two cocaine traffickers to 
the united states to face drug charges police said no one was 
reported injured in the blasts 
in the cocaine center of medellin the 4th army brigade said it 
arrested 28 leftist guerrillas and bandits it accused of working 
for drug traffickers 
the brigade in a statement made public today said the suspects 
belonged to the national liberation army one of six guerrilla 
groups operating in colombia and that together with 
narcotraffickers they had carried out terrorist acts in the 
medellin area in recent weeks 
the traffickers have used the attacks to try to persuade the 
government not to extradite drug lords to the united states to stand 
trial medellin a city 150 miles northwest of bogota that is the 
headquarters for colombias biggest cocaine cartel had been the 
focus of the attacks 
no one claimed responsibility for the explosions in bogota which 
damaged all four banks were damaged said a bogota police spokesman 
on condition of anonymity but suspicion fell on drug traffickers in 
the area 
the government announced thursday that it had arrested two 
members of the medellin cartel wanted in the united states and said 
they were being held in a maximum security prison pending 
extradition 
it also decreed a state of emergency in the cities of puerto 
boyaca and pacha in midwestern colombia just east of medellin 
the region is considered a stronghold for druglinked death 
squads and processing labs and the decree allows president virgilio 
barco to put army troops on alert and send military advisers to 
help the mayors of the two cities 
last week barco used special emergency powers to replace the 
mayors of those cities with military officers but he suspended the 
order after widespread criticism that it was unconstitutional 
the government identified the men to be extradited to the united 
states as bernardo pelaez roldan and guillermo bueno delgado 
the two were paraded before reporters at the national security 
department colombias version of the fbi on thursday pelaez 
bearded and wearing a leather jacket cursed at the journalists and 
threatened photographers with a cane he had a cut on his head 
a communique from the department said pelaez arrested wednesday 
outside the capital of bogota was wanted in detroit for 
conspiracy and distribution of cocaine the justice department 
in washington said he was convicted of drugtrafficking charges in 
detroit five years ago and faces 15 years in prison 
the justice department said bueno delgado was wanted on drug 
trafficking charges in tallahassee fla and san francisco and was 
accused of introducing 5740 kilos 12628 pounds of cocaine and 
money laundering 
the two are not among the socalled dirty dozen list prepared 
by the us drug enforcement administration of the most wanted 
colombian drug barons 
but the justice department also has another list not made 
public of 82 lesser colombian drug figures it was unknown whether 
pelaez and bueno delgado were on that list 
gen miguel maza marques who heads colombias antidrug war and 
the security department described pelaez as much bigger than 
eduardo martinez romero the alleged financier for the medellin 
cartel who was extradited to atlanta sept 6 
he has been the only person extradited so far under under a 
special decree by barco to bypass the courts and eliminate the 
possibility of bribes and intimidation by drug lords 
colombia launched the drug crackdown after the aug 18 
assassination of leading presidential candidate and antidrug 
crusader sen luis carlos galvan on aug 18 
the army has said it will continue the crackdown to the last 
sacrifice but despite a 250000 reward for top drug barons pablo 
escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha the two and other cartel 
leaders remain at large 
on thursday defense minister gen oscar botero restrepo held a 
news conference to deny rumors that american troops were helping 
colombia in its drug war 
botero said 17 us technicians were training colombians to 
use military equipment including weapons planes and helicopters 
which the bush administration sent as part of a 65 million aid 
package 
newspapers published an open letter by former presidents 
belisario betancourt and misael pastana borrero asking barco for 
clarification of reports involving us troops 
barco rejected an offer by the bush administration to send troops 
to help the antidrug effort however the pentagon has said up to 
200 military advisers could be sent to colombia to help in training 
and maintenance of the donated military equipment 
this has sparked fears and nationalistic fervor 
sen ernesto lucena accused the barco administration thursday of 
letting in equipment more fitting for an invasion of panama than 
helping root out a colombian drug mafia

claims 
lachelli did not return a telephone call thursday mauldin did

ladouceur and two others pleaded guilty to charges wednesday 
relating to the bilking of millions of dollars from suburban savings 
association in san antonio

billionaire investor marvin davis today said he 
would match a 675 billion buyout offer by pilots and managers of 
united airlines that has been approved by parent ual corp should 
the pilotmanagement bid fall through 
although he said that any bidder competing with the pilots and 
managers is at a clear competitive disadvantage davis said he 
was ready to pay 300 a share without requiring any labor 
concessions if the employeemanagement bid was not completed 
ual opened up 275 a share at 28325 today on the new york 
stock exchange 
on thursday ual corps directors approved a 300ashare or 
675 billion offer from the managementpilot group which could 
result in the nations largest employeeowned company 
the plan which includes a notstrike guarantee by the pilots and 
other costcutting labor concessions was the latest twist in a 
6week takeover battle 
davis the california investor who started the battle and 
previously bid 619 billion or 275 a share for ual said his 
offer today stands if the coalition proposal is not consummated on 
a timely basis 
we believe that this course of action may provide us with a 
higher probability of success in acquiring ual than attempting to 
bid against the coalition that has been arrayed against us davis 
said in a statement 
the pilotmanagement agreement was announced late thursday after 
the employee group made a final presentation to a special committee 
of the ual board and revealed the financing for its bid 
british airways plc would hold a a minority stake in ual under 
the agreement 
frederick dubinsky a spokesman for uniteds unit of the air line 
pilots association said he believes the plan will go forward 
we bring something to the table that no one else can bring 
dubinsky said in a telephone interview early today from new york 
the pilotmanagement groups proposal includes a sevenyear 
nostrike guarantee by the pilots and cuts in wages and benefits 
terms that any outsider would have difficulty matching 
under the agreement announced thursday chicagobased ual would 
merge with airline acquisition corp the group formed by pilots and 
management employees would own 75 percent of the company ual 
management would hold 10 percent and british airways plc would own 
15 percent 
the merger agreement we have just signed is designed to secure 
the future of united airlines and its 68000 employees to serve the 
public with quality air transportation and to provide the best value 
to uals shareholders said ual chairman stephen wolf 
the deal still would need the approval of shareholders and the 
department of transportation which is not expected to raise major 
objections although in the past it has been concerned about foreign 
carriers buying into us airlines 
with inclusion of financing costs the deal would total 72 
billion citibank and the chase manhattan bank have committed 3 
billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for an 
additional 42 billion officials said 
the buyout attempt is led by wolf and the 6300 united pilots 
represented by alpa the group had hoped to win support from 
uniteds other unions 
the association of flight attendants representing about 12700 
united workers met with management tuesday and has begun 
negotiations toward possible participation in the employee buyout 
effort said spokeswoman carol holmes 
but the international association of machinists representing 
25000 of uniteds 70000 employees has refused to back the 
proposal saying it would leave ual heavily in debt and could 
threaten the job security of union members 
in the past two years more than 300 companies have been purchased 
by their employees avis inc with 11000 employees is the 
nations largest company owned by its employees

a janitor who lost his winning ticket for a 3 
million lottery says hes not mad that it took him four years to 
claim the prize 
the lottery was doing their job said newlymade millionaire 
julius russell jr the school janitor from the south side picked up 
a certificate of his winnings from lottery officials thursday why 
should i feel resentment 
russell 60 matched all six winning lotto numbers in a november 
1985 drawing but accidently threw away his ticket 
he proved in court last month that he consistently played the 
same two sets of numbers in the weekly lotto game and the lottery 
confirmed that one of two winning tickets for the 6 million jackpot 
was purchased at the grocery where russell routinely plays the game 
the illinois state lottery had argued that lottery rules require 
possession of a ticket to win and officials appealed the court 
ruling 
but lottery director sharon sharp said thursday the agency was 
withdrawing its appeal after a check of lottery records showed 
prizes have been awarded previously to claimants who could not 
produce a winning ticket none of the prizes was for more than 
5000 
we thought mr russell should not have to suffer she said 
ms sharp presented russell with a mock check and said he would 
receive three installments of about 450000 within eight weeks the 
remainder will be paid in 17 annual installments she said 
i feel great i have five beautiful daughters and thats where 
its going russell said i havent thought about myself as of 
yet 
circuit judge robert sklowdowski ruled aug 10 that the lottery 
must pay russell the prize despite his inability to produce the 
winning ticket 
i have decided that paying this particular claimant is the 
fairest way to resolve this case ms sharp said we think he 
deserves the 3 million 
ms sharp said lottery officials would never again pay a claim 
without a ticket and would seek legislation to toughen the no 
ticket no win rule 
russell said he plans to keep his job 
the illinois state lottery has 14 million in unclaimed prizes 
ms sharp said and a lot of people make claims without tickets 
ms sharp said only one other state ohio had awarded a grand 
prize without a ticket

federal aviation officials doctored attendance 
records of air traffic controllers who were fired in chicago during 
the 1981 strike a house panel said today in recommending a probe 
for possible criminal misconduct 
officials produced altered documents when chicago controllers 
appealed their firings to the merit systems protection board and 
then attempted to conceal those activities during testimony to 
the board and a house subcommittee investigating the case lawmakers 
concluded 
the report by the public works subcommittee on investigations and 
oversight recommends the justice department review the testimony of 
federal aviation administration officials for possible misconduct 
our goal was to determine if a federal agency had trampled on 
the rights of individuals and we are able to conclude that a gross 
injustice did indeed take place said rep james l oberstar 
dminn chairman of the subcommittee during the investigation 
oberstar suggested today that the improprieties were rooted in 
poor labormanagement relations there was an atmosphere of mutual 
bitterness animosity that bordered on hatred they wanted to 
crush these people he said 
faa spokesman john leyden said today he could not immediately 
comment on the report 
the subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the more 
than 400 firings in chicago which were among 11500 ordered 
nationwide by thenpresident ronald reagan after members of the 
professional air traffic controllers organization went on strike 
rather the subcommittee report said it was concerned with the 
actions of faa officials while they were defending the firings in 
front of the merit systems protection board which considers appeals 
from dismissed federal employees 
the first two months of the strike were traumatic and confusing 
times at the chicago center where 80 percent of the controllers 
had joined the walkout the subcommittee report said 
supervisors were forced to handle other jobs and this 
situation severely affected the condition of the centers attendance 
records the report said 
on aug 13 1981 a month before chicago controllers started 
receiving final termination notices robert l miller evaluations 
officer at the center began to process personnel files in a 
special area dubbed the war room in anticipation of controller 
appeals to the federal merit board the subcommittee said 
to justify the firings faa officials decided to present 
attendance records showing the controllers failed to report to work 
during the strike the officials told the merit board the attendance 
records were the same ones used by george gunter chief of the 
chicago center when he dismissed the controllers 
but the subcommittee said that claim was false 
these documents in many cases either did not exist at the 
time of the controller dismissals or were riddled with errors the 
subcommittee said the fact that the records at the chicago center 
were seriously flawed was known by both center management and key 
faa officials in the regional office 
a plan was instituted whereby records were created where none 
existed and amended where there were errors the subcommittee said 
between sept 14 and oct 1 the records were sent to the faas 
great lakes regional office where the files were reviewed by the 
agencys labor specialists before sending them to the merit board 
but officials at the regional office found many errors and as a 
result war room employees produced a second set of attendance 
records which were sent to the merit board the report said faa 
officials assured the merit board that the records were the ones 
used by gunter a certification that we now know to be false 
the subcommittee said 
the subcommittee said it was not able to determine who ordered 
the second set of records but millers wife who worked in the 
war room and who was not identified in the report was the first 
person to admit to the panel that a second set had been produced 
the subcommittee said 
at a sept 14 1987 hearing miller acknowledged to the 
subcommittee that there was a second shipment of records but said 
he could not remember who ordered it the report said 
the faas regional manager for labor relations richard shewfelt 
acknowledged to the panel the first set of attendance records was 
faulty but said he did not know who was responsible for creating the 
extra set 
however the subcommittee said it is very likely that shewfelt 
and other regional officials knew of the problems of consistency 
and accuracy in the records that led to the second shipment

the soviet union today launched two monkeys into 
orbit to enable scientists to study the effects of zero gravity and 
space radiation on living beings tass reported 
on thursday the soviet union used a single rocket to put six 
cosmos satellites into orbit the series numbered 2038 through 
2043 were hurled into space by a tsiklon booster rocket tass said 
today 
the monkeys space capsule home which will be in orbit for the 
next two weeks was launched by a soyuz booster rocket the official 
news agency said 
tass said the experiment is part of a program organized by 
scientists from the united states canada france hungary east 
germany poland romania czechoslovakia and the european space 
agency 
after the flights program is fulfilled the biological 
specimens and scientific equipment will be returned to earth for 
further studies tass said 
in october 1987 the soviet union carried out space experiments 
with two monkeys who quickly captured the public imagination with 
their antics aboard the spacecraft beamed back to earth by 
television cameras 
one of the monkeys named yerosha broke free and appeared to 
viewers with a free left front paw and without his nametag on his 
helmet the mission was almost aborted when scientists learned he 
had blocked his food tube 
tass said of thursdays launch apart from scientific 
instrumentation the satellites have radio systems for precise 
measuring of orbital elements and radio systems to transmit data to 
earth on the operation of instruments and scientific equipment 
two soviet cosmonauts meanwhile were busy assembling and 
reactivating research equipment aboard the mir space station which 
had been mothballed for four months before they arrived on sept 5 
the news agency said 
cosmonauts alexander viktorenko and alexander serebrov on 
wednesday used the propulsion unit of their spaceship to change the 
orbit of the mir orbiter tass said 
it said they also had replaced components of the lifesupport 
systems and completed preparations for an experiment to produce 
highquality semiconductor materials in the gravityfree environment 
the cosmonauts are feeling fine tass said adding that they 
would take the weekend off to relax 
the 20ton spacecraft was designed to be permanently manned and 
two cosmonauts last year set a record by staying in space for a year 
but mir was unexpectedly unmanned in april because two addon 
modules were not ready the space agency also was under pressure 
from legislators and citizens who felt its funds could be better 
spent at home 
the fourmonth vacancy was only the second time that mir was 
unmanned since it was launched in february 1986

about 15000 protesters 
jogging chanting and waving banners marched today through the 
heart of johannesburg to a police headquarters where many activists 
have been detained and interrogated 
another antigovernment protest involving nearly 2000 people 
took place at the central square in pretoria the capital some 
demonstrators climbed onto a statue of paul kruger a political 
patriarch of the afrikaners who control the government 
both protests were among the largest ever staged in the two 
cities and dramatized the impact of presidentelect fw de klerks 
declaration this week that his whiteled government would not block 
peaceful protests 
on wednesday a day after de klerks statement more than 20000 
people marched in cape town against police brutality the largest 
such demonstration ever authorized by the government 
the rev peter storey a methodist leader said at a news 
conference after the johannesburg march that the series of peaceful 
protests marked a turning point in the history of our land 
in johannesburg marchers included black youths darksuited 
white professionals nuns and prominent activists among them winnie 
mandela wife of jailed black nationalist nelson mandela many 
youths carried posters demanding his release and chanted anc 
anc the initials of mandelas outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla movement 
about 10000 marchers began the protest but the crowd swelled to 
about 15000 as spectators joined the passing parade 
traffic officers cordoned off side streets leading into the 
parade route but did not interfere as scores of black and white 
church leaders headed the procession down thoroughfares that 
normally would have been clogged with lunchhour traffic 
in pretoria and johannesburg the only police action reported was 
against white hecklers pretoria police led away two men shouting 
abuse at protesters and johannesburg officers warned a white man 
who threw eggs at the parade 
the johannesburg protesters included a white man phillip botha 
who said he was a police reservist and carried a sign reading 
police against police abuse 
the march ended a block from john vorster square the main police 
station policemen looked out from virtually every window of the 
12story building 
six clergymen went to the entrance and one of them the rev 
frank chikane was allowed inside to present a memorandum 
protesting police violence the document also demanded an end to 
discriminatory and restrictive laws so negotiations could begin on 
ending apartheid 
chikane secretarygeneral of the south african council of 
churches emerged to tell waiting protesters we have proved our 
point 
the crowd prayed and then dispersed 
anglican bishop duncan buchanan one of the speakers at a church 
service before the march told protesters packed into st marys 
cathedral we are sick of violence and we refuse to be pushed 
around by a minority of a minority who support a godless and vile 
ideology 
the organizers had refused to ask official permission for the 
march but state radio said johannesburgs chief magistrate had 
given approval and a pretoria magistrate had given permission for a 
demonstration in the central church square 
chikane and other organizers repeatedly appealed to participants 
to remain disciplined and nonviolent even if police took action 
against them at one point he appealed to the crowd not to harass 
some suspected plainclothes security officers 
in pretoria hundreds of people gathered to support a picket by 
lawyers against the cape town violence where antiapartheid 
activists say at least 23 people died on election day police have 
confirmed 15 deaths 
more than 50 policemen stood around the park and about a dozen 
police trucks and armored vehicles were parked nearby 
the lawyers also had refused to seek permission for their 
protest saying it was part of the inalienable democratic right of 
the community atlarge to associate and express protest against 
any inhuman conduct 
the lawyers in pretoria and march organizers in johannesburg 
cited a march in cape town on wednesday by 20000 people as 
justification for their actions police stayed away from the cape 
town march and there was no violence although thousands of people 
thronged the streets for about four hours in the largest legal 
antigovernment protest held in south africa 
the cape town march organizers had refused to seek permission 
but mayor gordon oliver asked for it after acting president fw de 
klerk said he would not oppose the protest if it was peaceful and 
legal 
the progovernment johannesburg newspaper the citizen said 
today the victory in cape town is bound to encourage the 
radicals to put on even more pressure raising the specter of 
renewed unrest 
the antiapartheid new nation a black newspapr in johannesburg 
said the march in cape town showed that the state is in 
retreat each backward step must mark the advance of our 
people 
the johannesburg newspaper business day said of the marches 
there will be another and another each of them raising the 
stakes until confrontation ensues violence it is safe to say is 
almost inevitable and the television cameras are waiting

president bush has given agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter the authority to released an additional 2 million 
metric tons of emergency wheat for use as food aid to distressed 
areas of the world 
the white house announcement thursday said the wheat could be 
used to provide emergency food assistance to developing 
countries that run short of domestic supplies 
under the food security wheat reserve act of 1980 a stockpile of 
4 million tons about 147 million bushels was created for use to 
supply emergency food relief abroad 
the first time the stockpile was tapped was last october when 
president reagan authorized release of 15 million tons when it 
became apparent there would not be enough wheat in the marketplace 
to fill the needs of developing countries 
with the authorization to use an additional 2 million tons the 
special reserve is virtually depleted that was one reason yeutter 
gave earlier this week when he announced a liberalization of the 
governments 1990 wheat program to help rebuild us stockpiles 
including the special reserve

a bipartisan group of senators including the 
majority leader unveiled legislation today rivaling president 
bushs proposal for improving air quality in smogchoked cities 
the bill would like the bush measure tighten automobile 
emissions requirements but does not include two key elements of the 
presidents proposal a forced switch from todays gasoline to 
cleanburning motor fuels in severely polluted cities and 
permission for automakers to average emissions by engine category to 
comply with antipollution requirements 
instead the rival measure would require each car to meet the 
emissions standards as under current law and would allow 
automakers to choose whether to build cars for alternative fuels or 
reduce pollution in other ways 
the legislation like the bush measure sets new deadlines 
ranging from 5 to 20 years for cities to clean up their smog 
problems but the placement of cities in the various categories 
would be different 
i expect this bill will cut auto emissioins by 50 percent by 
the year 2000 said chief sponsor max baucus dmont adding that 
the bush plan wont get us across the finish line in improving 
air quality 
the bill was cosponsored by sen john chafee rri the 
ranking republican on the senate environment committee and was 
strongly endorsed by majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
in setting new ozone deadlines 101 geographical areas failed to 
meet the nowexpired cleanup timetables the new legislation would 
only give los angeles 20 years to clean up its ozone problem the 
bush legislation would allow three others areas new york city 
houston and gary ind to take 20 years 
the baucus legislation would give those three cities 15 years 
but like the bush measure would force those with the longest 
extensions to institute the most severe antipollution measures 
the bush measure is before the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee which will consider amendments next week 
chafee is not only cosponsoring the baucus bill but also is the 
chief senate sponsor of the bush legislation 
chafees agreement to back the baucus ozone provisions places him 
at odds with parts of the bush plan which had backing from only 
three democratic senators when it was introduced last month 
asked why hes backing two bills with conflicting provisions 
chafee said he agrees with the baucus approach for ozone reduction 
the senator said he agreed to sponsor the administration bill even 
though he doesnt back some of its provisions because it was the 
first effort an administration has made in eight years to tackle 
the nations air quality problem 
former president reagan did not propose a comprehensive clean air 
revision during his two terms in office 
it marks the second time in two days that a chief sponsor of the 
bush clean air bill has signaled disagreement with a major portion 
of the legislation 
on thursday the chief democratic sponsor in the house rep john 
d dingell dmich expressed strong reservations with bushs 
proposed cap on future emissions of sulfur dioxide the chief 
ingredient of acid rain the limit would make it difficult for 
utilities the main source of acid rain to grow and take on new 
customers dingell argued 
baucus said his legislation would tighten tailpipe standards for 
autos with the goal of cutting car pollution in half by the year 
2000 
but it would not force use of cleanburning motor vehicle fuels 
in severely polluted cities 
the bush administration calls its clean fuels program the most 
innovative and farreaching component of its ozonecutting 
proposals the administration would force a portion of the car fleet 
in the most seriously polluted cities to operate on clean burning 
fuels such as methanol ethanol natural gas electricity propane 
or reformulated gasoline 
the president wants a sale schedule for such vehicles beginning 
with 500000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year and going 
up to one million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004 
the baucus proposal would give automakers discretion in deciding 
how to reduce car pollution and hand them the option of using clean 
fuels or other methods 
i dont think its wise to mandate change in the marketplace so 
that certain users have to use certain kinds of cars baucus said

former president reagan left the hospital 
for his home in los angeles today tipping his hat to wellwishers 
and revealing a shaved spot on his head where mayo clinic physicians 
performed skull surgery a week ago 
reagan 78 and his wife nancy boarded a privately owned dc9 
jet which took off shortly after 10 am 
about 100 people many of them travelers at the rochester 
airport gathered as the rochester lourdes high school marching band 
played while reagan said goodbye to mayo clinic officials and to 
retired mayo physician dr oliver beahrs 
beahrs a friend of mrs reagans late father who also was a 
physician said reagan was returning home in good health 
im just very happy for him and for her he said any 
operation is a serious one but this was fairly simple and he came 
through it very well 
scott patterson pilot of the dc9 said the weather from 
rochester in southeastern minnesota to los angeles looked clear for 
the 3hour flight he said the plane belonged to a friend of the 
reagans whose name he would not disclose 
reagan spokesman mark weinberg said thursday that the reagans 
would go directly to their home in los angeles after the flight 
weinberg also said thursday that doctors were completely 
satisfied with reagans recovery the former president had been 
recuperating at st marys hospital since doctors on sept 8 drained 
fluid that had built up on his brain after he was thrown from a 
horse on july 4 
on thursday reagan met with labor secretary elizabeth dole who 
was in the state to give a speech and soviet parliament member 
boris yeltsin 
it seemed as if he feels pretty good yeltsin said after the 
20minute meeting weve never had a personal meeting before 
the 58yearold yeltsin was in minneapolis for a private dinner 
wednesday with business leaders he said he squeezed the reagan 
visit into his weeklong tour of the united states simply as a 
sign of respect for him and an opportunity to wish him a rapid 
recovery 
yeltsin brought reagan a bouquet of red roses and according to 
weinberg told him you gave the start to the very perceptible 
warming of relations between the two countries your contribution to 
this was enormous you were very wise courageous and tactful in the 
way you went about it i am very grateful to you for this 
dumped as communist party chief in moscow in 1987 after 
criticizing some of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policies 
yeltsin was overwhelmingly elected to parliament this year running 
as an outsider he has been urging gorbachev to quicken the pace of 
reform in the soviet union 
yeltsin said he hadnt requested reagans help in his push for 
soviet economic change i thought that would have been a little 
tactless since hes in the hospital he said

five astronauts who will dispatch a 
nuclearpowered probe to jupiter in october concluded a practice 
countdown aboard space shuttle atlantis today finishing up a bit 
late because of minor computer problems 
the astronauts and their support crews carried the dress 
rehearsal for launch day to its finish even though stormy weather 
near the kennedy space center would have prevented an actual liftoff 
the countdown ended at 1110 am about 10 minutes later than 
planned nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said launch crews needed extra 
time to fix two problems in computers monitoring the shuttles 
systems 
despite the problems she said everything proceeded very 
smoothly in this dress rehearsal it was a good test run for 
everyone on the launch team and also for the astronauts 
the astronauts were aboard atlantis for the final two hours of 
the count it was the last time they will be inside the space 
shuttle until launch day 
commander don williams told reporters thursday he and his 
crewmates looked forward to the exercise because its a real treat 
to get on board the ship the ship is pretty special to us 
the other crew members are pilot mike mccully and mission 
specialists shannon lucid franklin changdiaz and ellen baker 
the countdown test which began thursday covers the final 24 
hours of an actual countdown and provides training for both the 
astronauts and the launch team 
atlantis liftoff is scheduled for oct 12 but nasa will not set 
a firm date until the conclusion of a twoday flight readiness 
review on oct 3 
during the first day of the fiveday flight the astronauts are 
to release the galileo spacecraft on the start of a sixyear voyage 
to explore jupiter the craft is to orbit the planet and fire a 
probe into its atmosphere 
antinuclear activists have said they will try to block the 
launch either through court action or with their bodies because 
galileo is powered by two nuclear generators fueled by plutonium238 
dioxide 
if the activists cannot get a federal court injunction we are 
going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad 
to halt the launch said bruce gagnon coordinator for the florida 
coalition for peace and justice one of the opposition groups 
a recent space agency safety analysis concluded the probability 
of an accident resulting in a release of plutonium ranges from 
1in2500 to 1in2 million and any release from these low 
probability events would be very small 
similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power for 22 
earlier us spacecraft including six manned apollo moon flights 
and the voyager 2 spacecraft which recently sent back pictures of 
the planet neptune 
the five astronauts flying the mission say they are confident the 
nuclear generators are safe 
i wish everybody had the insight i had and the access to the 
reports that ive read because i think if they did they would not 
have any of the fears they are talking about baker told reporters 
thursday 
asked about the possibility of the protesters physically stopping 
the launch lucid said the kennedy space center has real good 
security folks here and theyre working very hard to protect the 
vehicle and protect the premises and i expect thats the way it 
will be so i dont expect any delays because of that

dozens of rifletoting police 
surrounded a courthouse where two colombians faced cocaine charges 
after authorities in this city north of maine arrested four heavily 
armed venezuelans 
officials said they did not know if the venezuelans had planned 
to interfere with thursdays judicial proceedings in fredericton 
the provincial capital 125 miles southeast of edmunston 
sgt mark flemming of the royal canadian mounted police said he 
ordered the heavy security because we are assessing the situation 
regarding the situation in colombia where officials have launched 
a crackdown on drug traffickers 
an ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure he said 
the mounted police and edmundston authorities arrested the 
venezuelans wednesday and seized weapons from two cars and a van 
near downtown edmundston a pulp and paperproducing town nearly 
300 miles northeast of augusta on the tip of maine 
police led the men into a provincial court where they were 
charged with a variety of weapons offenses 
innocent innocent one of the handcuffed men told reporters 
no speak english another said 
the men were identified as tito sanchez euovio manzano osvaldo 
gonzales and wilmer ramon zanabria court documents did not state 
their ages or hometowns 
only two of the men had lawyers all were remanded in custody 
until tuesday when they will reappear for bail hearings further 
charges may yet be filed against them 
authorities said the weapons found in their vehicles included an 
uzi submachine gun soviet and israeli assault rifles and more than 
3000 rounds of ammunition also seized were six automatic pistols 
a 22caliber pistol tear gas a deactivated japanese grenade 
burglary equipment and an electric zap gun used to knock people out 
in a related incident a fifth man with venezuelan identification 
was arrested at a car rental agency thursday police said they 
seized two handguns at the scene 
bill damours of the canandian immigration department said the 
venezuelans passports were sent to the mounted police forensic lab 
in ottawa to check if the documents are valid 
he said it was not known how the men entered canada 
two of their vehicles had new york licenses including one stolen 
plate police said the vehicle carrying most of the weapons had 
been rented in fredericton 
the four were carrrying maps marking a destination in new 
brunswick that police would not identify 
the colombian suspects jose ali galindoescobar and fernando 
augusto mendozajarmillio both 36 thursday were ordered held for 
trial next month 
the two were charged with importing drugs in april after police 
made canadas largest cocaine seizure when they found about 1100 
pounds of the drug inside the nose of an airplane at a makeshift 
airstrip outside fredericton 
the mounted police say colombian drug cartels have been routing 
more drugs through the canadian maritime provinces because the 
united states has tightened up its borders in an effort to block 
drug traffickers 
as somebody put it to me today it feels like the long arm of 
incivility in colombia is reaching into new brunswick said 
provincial premier frank mckenna i think everyone in new 
brunswick feels a great sense of unease

nervous workers met with counselors today 
as they returned to the printing plant where seven people were 
killed by a former coworker who swore hed get even after being 
dismissed for mental disability 
im thinking seriously about looking somewhere else for another 
job my nerves are shot said pressman steve pate if i go back 
in there ill be waiting for someone else to do the same thing and 
i cant handle that 
joseph t wesbecker armed with several semiautomatic weapons 
went from floor to floor shooting people at the standard gravure 
corp on thursday morning killing seven and wounding 13 before 
taking his own life one coworker said wesbecker had been looking 
for bosses 
workers began gathering at the plant this morning and officials 
said 15 counselors were on hand to help them discuss and work 
through their grief 
im looking forward to that i need that said pressman 
mickey kelly who was only a few feet from wesbecker at one point 
during the shooting 
forklift operator bernard williams said he would take a weeks 
vacation 
im not ready to come back because of everything thats 
happened things like this could happen again williams said i 
just dont feel like i can go in there and work 
there are a lot of workers who have been traumatized by this 
its a shame that management treats people like dogs they should 
treat employees like human beings instead of just a number 
pate agreed its push push push they want us to do more 
work they want you to work all the overtime you can if you dont 
they send you home its more than people can handle anymore 
wesbecker a 47yearold pressman was placed on permanent 
disability leave last year because of mental illness police said 
he carried a big grudge because of that said george oswine 
a former coworker he said before he left he would get even i 
remember that 
oswine said wesbecker had begun collecting guns since his leave 
another former coworker pressman joe white said wesbeckers 
talk centered on guns and soldier of fortune magazine white whose 
brother lloyd was killed in the rampage said wesbecker thought of 
himself as a soldier 
this guys been talking about this for a year white said 
i guess nobody believed him said dan frazier president of 
the union local 
frazier said wesbecker had become more upset recently because he 
thought his disability benefits were about to be cut off 
relatives told police that wesbecker was a manic depressive who 
had attempted suicide three times wesbecker also had voluntarily 
spent time in mental institutions said lt jeff moody commander of 
the police homicide division 
wesbecker entered the building at 830 am edt and took the 
elevator to the third floor 
he just came off the elevator shooting said kathy wilkins 
an assistant buyer the elevator doors opened and he started 
firing 
two receptionists apparently were the first to be hit both were 
wounded one later died 
police found four other victims on the third floor where the 
executive offices and bindery are located wesbecker went from there 
down to the basement where five victims were found then up to the 
ground floor where six victims and the gunman were discovered 
wesbecker was face down in a pool of blood on the floor of a 
pressroom 
two other wounded people had been removed by medics before police 
arrived and another victim was on the street outside 
former coworker john tingle said he greeted wesbecker as he saw 
him coming around a corner in the basement carrying an ak47 assault 
rifle 
he quoted wesbecker as saying i told them id be back get 
away from me 
tingle obliged and wesbecker proceeded up the stairs to the first 
floor 
he didnt fire at me i guess because he liked me tingle 
said but the guys he had shot in the pressroom were friends too 
police maj ed mercer said police had not determined how many 
workers were in the building but it was a bunch they were 
stampeding over us as we were trying to get in 
sgt frank portman one of the first officers on the scene said 
he felt helpless 
every place we went we were stepping over people and blood 
portman said people were wailing wanting help and with a 
shooting victim theres not much you can do 
three of the wounded were in critical condition this morning 
including a 45yearold man whose condition was described as very 
critical said officials at humana hospitaluniversity of 
louisville where more than 100 doctors were called in to help treat 
them five other people were in serious condition 
wesbeckers weapons included the ak47 two mac11 semiautomatic 
machine pistols a 38caliber handgun a 9mm automatic pistol and a 
bayonet said police chief richard dotson he carried a duffel bag 
full of ammunition 
wesbecker reportedly had made threats against the company which 
prints newspaper inserts and sunday newspaper supplements but 
standard gravure president michael shea said he did not know of any 
threats 
im at a loss to speculate on anything shea said whats 
going through my mind right now is sympathy and caring for the 
people who are involved 
a woman who answered the telephone at a house where wesbeckers 
mother was staying said the family did not want to comment 
were just in shock like everybody else we had to find out 
over the television no one called us said the woman who did not 
identify herself i guess he was just a sick person thats all 
wesbecker was divorced twice in the past 11 years he and his 
first wife had two sons james 22 and joseph 26 
im just tore up inside joseph wesbacker said thursday as he 
left his mothers home in louisville 
wesbecker and his second wife brenda were also divorced but 
they had been living together since 1987 moody said 
police said brenda wesbecker didnt want wesbecker to keep any 
weapons around their home and didnt know that he had any police 
described her as shocked by the shootings

a hurricane watch was posted in the eastern 
caribbean today as hurricane hugo churned westward with winds of 125 
mph and some stregthening predicted forecasters said 
the hurricane watch was posted from st lucia to the british 
virgin islands and a tropical storm watch was issued for the 
islands of barbados and st vincent according to the national 
hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
the fringe effects of the storm are already being felt said 
forecaster gil clark the seas are already getting rough off the 
islands because of swells emanating off the storm 
at noon edt hugos center was located near 144 north latitude 
and 541 west longitude or about 500 miles east southeast of 
guadeloupe in the leeward islands the storm was moving west at 15 
mph down from a peak of 20 mph wednesday night 
the only way its going to miss those islands is its going to 
have to swerve northward clark said 
he added that forecasters saw no indications hugo would turn that 
way weve been lucky this year weve had two or three storms 
head toward the islands and then turn north maybe well get lucky 
again but it doesnt look like it in ths case 
three of this seasons atlantic hurricanes dean erin and 
gabrielle turned north into the open atlantic before reaching the 
caribbean forecaster hal gerrish said 
last year killer hurricane gilbert held the westward course 
pounding jamaica and mexico 
hugo developed quickly into a major storm its highest sustained 
winds rose by more than 35 mph thursday alone and were estimated at 
120 mph this morning inching up to 125 mph at noon 
it really was amazing how fast the eye formed and it almost 
doubled its winds clark said conditions favored the hurricanes 
strengthening today forecasters expected no change in its motion 
hugos winds classify it as a 3 on the saffirsimpson scale a 
sort of richter scale for storms gilbert the strongest hurricane 
on record was a 5 the scales highest rank 
a reconnaissance plane was to be dispatched to investigate the 
storm clark said 
hugo is the eighth named storm of the 1989 atlantic hurricane 
season tropical storms have sustained winds of 39 mph and reach

ptl founder jim bakker continued to 
receive huge bonuses while the troubled tv ministry was laying off 
hundreds of workers witnesses testified today in his federal fraud 
and conspiracy trial 
i had to go to social services and apply for welfare and food 
stamps said joanie ames a former ptl payroll clerk who was laid 
off in november 1985 along with 285 other ptl employees 
less than a year later on nov 3 1986 the ptl board approved a 
500000 bonus for bakker he had also received other bonuses during 
the year 
the rev evelyn spencer of oakland calif who joined the board 
in november 1985 testified that the largest bonus she remembered 
approving was 150000 plus taxes 
but when asked by prosecutor deborah smith if she would have 
approved a 500000 bonus for bakker ms spencer said if 
everybody else agreed with it i would have 
she said she trusted bakker to keep board members informed of the 
ministrys financial condition i just trusted him period she 
said 
prosecutors contend bakker diverted 37 million in ptl funds to 
fund his lavish lifestyle if convicted of all 24 counts against 
him bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more 
than 5 million 
on thursday bakkers righthand man at ptl testified that the 
evangelist gave his tv viewers phony fundraising figures and knew 
that 265000 in church funds went to jessica hahn as hush money 
richard dortch ptls former executive vice president told 
jurors the ministry kept two sets of fundraising figures a secret 
one with the actual numbers and a phony one with lower numbers that 
bakker read to tv viewers 
no one understands this plan really but me dortch recalled 
bakker telling him 
later dortch testified that bakker personally approved paying 
hahn to keep her quiet about their 1980 sexual encounter in a 
florida hotel room bakker resigned from ptl in march 1987 as the 
encounter was about to be made public 
dortch 57 was indicted with bakker and last month pleaded 
guilty to four counts of fraud and conspiracy in a plea bargain in 
exchange for his testimony against bakker he was sentenced to eight 
years in prison and fined 200000 
dortch who joined ptl in december 1983 said by 1987 almost all 
ptl revenues came from sale of lifetime partnerships supposedly 
good for lodging each year for life at heritage usa ptls christian 
theme park near fort mill sc he said the money was desperately 
needed to cover operating costs including a biweekly payroll of 
nearly 1 million 
bakker considered the partnerships an unlimited gold mine 
according to dortch 
he said bakker told him this was the easiest money we could 
raise and there would be no limit to what amount could be raised in 
the days to come 
the trial has included testimony from former partners who said 
they sent bakker 1000 for lodging but were turned away when they 
tried to claim their rooms 
bakker was willing to oversell the partnerships because he was 
convinced he could manipulate the comings and goings of partnership 
owners by getting partners here when we wanted them to come and by 
keeping them away when we dont want them to come dortch 
testified 
dortch released a week ago from a hospital where he was treated 
for an undisclosed ailment also testified he told bakker about 
calls from ms hahn threatening a lawsuit over their sexual 
encounter 
dortch said bakker told him i have not raped anyone or 
assaulted anyone but there is a problem do what you have to do 
to get it solved 
dortch said he paid ms hahn 2000 from his own pocket and later 
borrowed 10000 from another ptl employee for ms hahn in 1984 
dortch arranged a february 1985 meeting in los angeles with ms 
hahns lawyer and handed over 265000 the money came from roe 
messner a ptl contractor who later billed the ministry for work 
never completed on ptls passion play amphitheater 
after the los angeles meeting dortch said he saw bakker at 
heritage usas main street shopping arcade and told him about the 
payoff he testified bakker said i dont want to know and i dont 
want to hear about it

the bodies of 18 men were found near 
the central city of kandy on friday and residents said the victims 
appeared to be sinhalese radicals killed by progovernment groups 
the government denied knowing the identities of the victims or 
their killers but said two radicals were killed and 279 people 
arrested in the continuing crackdown on militant members of the 
sinhalese majority 
at least 18 partially burned bodies were found in three places 
near kandy said residents speaking on condition of anonymity 
in telephone interviews they said they believed the victims were 
sinhalese radicals killed by progovernment vigilante groups 
military officials in colombo confirmed the bodies were found but 
did not say who the dead were or who killed them 
opposition politicians and human rights organizations allege the 
government has set up death squads to counter the campaign of 
assassinations by the peoples liberation front an ultranationalist 
guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government 
the government denies the charge 
security forces arrested 279 suspects since thursday in the 
latest crackdown on the sinhalese front in the south and center of 
the island nation a government statement said the regions are 
dominated by sinhalese and are areas where the radical groups draw

rockwell international corp may begin to shut down 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant as early as today unless 
federal agencies decide how it should handle the operations wastes 
the company said 
rockwell which operates the plant for the department of energy 
said thursday it needs to know what its liability is for the 
radioactive and hazardous wastes that are being stockpiled at the 
plant where plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs are produced 
i know weve expressed that concern to doe and have asked that 
they reach some kind of resolution by today if possible said 
rockwell spokesman dennis hurtt 
he said the company has various contingency plans if no 
resolution is reached including the beginning of a shutdown 
procedure 
that would always be an option i suppose he said its 
something well have to wait and see 
rockwell and energy department officials said there were no 
further developments this morning officials with the energy 
department and environmental protection agency were working on the 
matter in washington 
were waiting at this point for an answer said doe spokesman 
tom walton acting public information officer at rocky flats 
rockwell addressed its concerns to the doe which owns the 
facility the us environmental protection agency the colorado 
health department and the us justice department 
the company said it is concerned improper handling of wastes can 
lead to criminal charges against rockwell employees and managers a 
mix of radioactive and hazardous wastes has built up for which there 
is no federally approved disposal site available 
weve got to have someone make some decisions hurtt said 
the regulations have been changing and keep changing in recent 
years very rapidly 
this is not the first time the liability issue has come up or 
that a possible closure has been threatened but the earlier threat 
in july came from within the energy department which feared its 
officials could face criminal charges over environmental violations 
at the site 16 miles northeast of denver 
the acting doe area manager at the time edward s goldberg 
threatened to close down the plant unless some immunity was granted 
for those violations as a result the epa and doe agreed to come up 
with a resolution to the situation by today the same deadline set 
by rockwell 
an fbi affidavit unsealed in june alleged that workers at the 
nuclear weapons plant dumped toxic chemicals into creeks that lead 
to water supplies for four denver suburbs and illegally burned 
hazardous wastes at the site 
those allegations are being reviewed before a special grand jury 
rockwell has said its own investigation produced no evidence of 
wrongdoing

sweeney todd is stephen sondheims most 
relentless and uncompromising musical a brilliant but chilling tale 
of revenge 
that chill permeated the original 1979 production from demonic 
performances by len cariou and angela lansbury to harold princes 
brechtian direction to the mammoth black ironfoundry sets of 
eugene and franne lee 
now in an intimate revival which opened thursday at broadways 
circle in the square director susan schulman has sought to 
humanize if not soften the story and its leading characters the 
change makes for a remarkable reworking of what is still the most 
unnerving musical ever to reach broadway 
this is a much more personal sweeney todd than the original 
which seemed at times to be more an indictment of the industrial 
revolution for what it had done to british society than the story of 
real people 
sorrow and even a little pity for todd and his cohorts creep into 
the bloodthirsty goingson at the circle in the square thats 
something the brutal but effective original production didnt allow 
hugh wheelers underrated book taken from an adaptation by 
british playwright edward bond seems better than it was 10 years 
ago a model of compression it tells of todd a barber who returns 
to london after an unjust exile and imprisonment in australia he 
finds his wife gone and his daughter the ward of the lascivious 
judge turpin 
todd plots revenge with the help of mrs lovett a dotty maker of 
meat pies the barber slits the throats of his customers and their 
corpses provide fresh ingredients for mrs lovetts delicacies 
much of what schulman has accomplished has been dictated by the 
intheround playing area the show began life last spring at the 
york theater company a tiny offoffbroadway troupe which uses an 
east side school gymnasium for its productions on broadway the 
director and set designer james morgan surround the audience with 
scenery a panorama of london tenements of the late 19th century 
covers the theaters walls so do clotheslines of drying laundry 
at one end of the stage sprawls mrs lovetts pie shop and at the 
other the home of judge turpin in between the cobblestone streets 
of london become the arena for much of the crowd action a fog 
machine works overtime to create the right smoky atmosphere 
bob guntons portrayal of the title character echoes the len 
cariou original his voice may not be as strong as carious but his 
acting has more range 
there are more changes in the character of mrs lovett seen here 
as a woman willing to do anything for love rather than the grotesque 
comic figure so wonderfully portrayed by lansbury beth fowler is a 
softer giddier mrs lovett than her predecessor shes also a 
better singer and gives a sweeter emphasis to such comic songs as 
by the sea and the worst pies in london 
sondheims monumental score is a study in contrasts haunting 
melodies such as not while im around johanna and pretty 
woman clash with much harsher numbers such as the ballad of 
sweeney todd epiphany and city on fire 
the supporting cast must grapple with some of the most difficult 
songs in the show there are expert portraits and some notable 
singing by david barron as the evil judge and michael mccarty as the 
porcine beadle 
also turning in fine work are jim walton as anthony the young 
sailor in love with todds daughter johanna and eddie korbich as 
tobias mrs lovetts young assistant in the pie shop korbich 
delivers a touching version of not while im around the lullaby 
tobias sings to mrs lovett but bill nabel misses the comedy of 
pirelli todds illfated italian competitor and gretchen kingsley 
as johanna sings harshly 
sweeney todd originally succeeded as a largescale 
combination of grand guignol and melodrama it was a horror story 
that didnt allow the audience to get close to the characters by 
reducing the scale schulman does and makes the show more 
effective and more unsettling her villains are much more vulnerable 
and everyday normal 
at the end of the musical when the actors turn and point their 
fingers at the audience schulman makes the point that there may be 
a little bit of sweeney todd lurking in all of us 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times by forcing us to face mr 
sondheims music and the feelings it contains so intensely ms 
schulman doesnt obliterate the prince production she creates an 
alternative such is the depth of mr sondheims achievement that 
sweeney todd can support radically different interpretations 
linda winer new york newsday the show is a fast raging 
beautifully bittersweet and deliciously junky grand guignol 
don nelsen daily news todd is too long at 2 hours and 55 
minutes but its music and performances are worth it

communist north korea has rejected a 
south korean proposal to create a single korean commonwealth as an 
interim measure to unify the rival korean states officials said 
friday 
the rodong shinmun the newspaper of north koreas ruling 
workers party rejected the new south korean plan as perpetuating 
the division of the peninsula said officials at south koreas 
national unification board 
this proposal is only aimed at legalizing the existence of 
two states on the peninsula and making them live separately 
forever the officials quoted the newspaper as saying 
south koran president roh taewoo on monday announced the 
proposal which calls for a single commonwealth as an interim 
measure in merging the nations 
to create a commonwealth both koreas should adopt a single 
constitution under which a free election should be held to form a 
unified korean state roh said 
while rejecting rohs proposal the north korean newspaper 
repeated the norths longstanding formula to unify the peninsula 
under a confederation that would keep the two sides conflicting 
political and economic systems intact the officials said 
the paper also demanded that the 43000 us troops stationed in 
south korea under a mutual defense treaty be withdrawn before 
creation of a single korean state officials said

early detection and treatment of those infected 
with the aids virus may help avert one of the most serious epidemics 
of our time but the cost of doing so may push the us health 
system into chaos medical researchers said today 
the cost of finding and treating those who carry the virus but 
are not yet ill could reach 5 billion or more a yearwith urban 
areas the hardest hit researchers reported in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
while the economic challenge of early intervention is 
substantial for hardhit regions it can be managed if the federal 
government takes on greater financial responsibility said the 
researchers from new yorks montefiore medical center and the 
universities of north carolina and california 
recent advances in the treatment of those infected with the virus 
but who do not yet have fullfledged cases of aids make a compelling 
case for expanding early treatment said the researchers led by 
montefiores peter arno 
because of new antiviral therapies that slow the disease and 
drugs that can prevent a common form of pneumonia associated with 
the disease early detection may slow the fatal diseases progress 
the researchers said 
they suggested that policymakers devise a strategy that expands 
the capabilities of hospitalaffiliated outpatient clinics to 
accommodate better patient monitoring and increased counseling 
the authors estimate that the annual cost for a patient with no 
symptoms would be about 854 until drug intervention is needed once 
drugs and increased medical care are needed a midrange estimate 
would be about 9600 annually they said 
if treatment were available to half of those infected with the 
hiv virus today the cost would be more than 48 billion assuming 
more than 1 million people currently carry the virus but are not yet 
diagnosed with aids 
the article also suggested overpricing by drug companies accounts 
for a large portion of early treatment costs drug therapy will 
account for approximately 80 percent of the cost of early 
intervention they said 
one companys ability to market a drug without price restraints 
has led to a quadrupling of its parent companys stock it said 
although drug companies have a legitimate need to recoup their 
research investments the public expects reasonable prices for 
lifesaving drugs they wrote

the salvadoran government and leftist rebels 
reached an agreement today calling for monthly talks mediated by the 
roman catholic church to end their nations 10yearold civil war

farabundo marti national liberation front guerrillas as a political 
party and of integrating the fighters back into civilian life 
roman catholic church leaders will act as mediators during the 
talks which will also be monitored by international observers 
unless both sides agree that a specific meeting should be private 
sources close to the negotiations said

cristianis ussupported rightist government

well the text will be released today said jose abelardo torre a 
businessman and one of the five members of the salvadoran government

demand that church leaders and international observers be present at 
the talks arguing the dispute was a salvadoran affair 
the government also wanted the talks to be held every two months 
instead of monthly as the rebels demanded 
ana guadalupe martinez a guerrilla leader and member of the 
leftist delegation confirmed that both sides agreed the talks will 
be held monthly 
asked if it meant the rebel demands had prevailed she replied 
i believe so because they were the correct ones 
torre and martinez gave separate interviews to the associated 
press 
the roman catholic auxiliary bishop of el salvador gregorio rosa 
chavez described the mood at the discussions as stupendous 
speaking at a news conference thursday night he said the main 
issues of the 10point document were the ceasefire and bringing the 
rebels into salvadoran politicial life 
rosa chavez said the first meeting probably would be held next 
month 
its clear that the two sides have reached a clear agreement 
that they should be attempting to reach not just a ceasefire but an 
end to hostilities rosa chavez said 
im very content i believe this is a very important day for 
all salvadorans he said you cant solve 10 years of war in 10 
days but putting ourselves on the path to peace is an important 
achievement 
the current round of talks began wednesday and were the first in 
two years between the guerrilla group and the government the talks 
also were the first for the government of president cristiani who 
took office june 1 
fighting continued thursday in el salvador despite a unilateral 
truce declared by the guerrillas

that two guerrillas and one soldier were wounded he also said a 
helicopter was damaged and two buses were torched

the supreme court on friday rejected a 
petition by ferdinand marcos to return home and agreed with 
president corazon aquino that the former presidents return would 
threaten the nation 
the judges voted 87 against marcos return supporting the 
government position that it would wipe away the gains achieved 
during the past few years and lead to total economic collapse 
we cannot argue with that determination the court wrote in a 
30page opinion 
marcos had appealed mrs aquinos decision not allow him his 
wife imelda and other family members to return to the philippines 
marcos has lived in exile in hawaii since 1986 following a popular 
uprising that brought mrs aquino to power 
mrs aquino accuses marcos of stealing billions of dollars during 
his 20year rule 
in october the united states indicted the marcoses on criminal 
racketeering charges for allegedly stealing more than 100 million 
from the philippine treasury and using it to buy art and real estate 
in new york

rocket and artillery duels flared across 
beirut on friday after a twoday lull killing seven people and 
raising doubts that arab league efforts to end the bloodshed would 
succeed 
beiruts shrunken population returned to underground shelters 
overnight as the syrianchristian battles picked up after a brief 
morning break the exchanges flared again in the afternoon sending 
scores of artillery rounds and rockets crashing into christian east 
beirut and the moslem sector in the west 
police said seven people were killed and 21 wounded bringing the 
overall toll to 902 killed and 2613 wounded since the fighting 
began march 8 
the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria ended 
a twoday meeting in saudi arabia on thursday and said they would 
present to arab leaders plans for ending the violence details of 
the plans were expected to be released in a communique saturday 
the meetings were the first held by the mediation committee since 
july 31 when the panel appointed accused syria of blocking peace 
efforts by refusing to withdraw its soldiers from lebanon the 
committee was appointed by the arab league in may to find a solution 
to the crisis 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon they were deployed in 1976 
under an arab league mandate to quell the countrys civil war but 
have joined with moslem militias to fight the mainly christian 
troops of gen michel aoun 
aoun has declared a war of liberation to drive out the 
syrians the latest confrontation began in march after aoun 
blockaded militiarun ports the syrians responded by shelling the 
310squaremile christian heartland north of beirut 
syrian gunners alternating between 130mm mortars and 
multibarraled rocket launchers hammered east beirut and the 
surrounding christian hinterland friday 
aouns gunners blasted west beirut and hills to the southeast 
with usmade 155mm howitzers and mortars of various caliber

targeted by the random barrages and urged residents to take 
precautions 
only 10 percent of beiruts 15 million people remain in the 
city the others have fled to safer areas of lebanon or left the 
country altogether 
residents appeared skeptical the arab committee would succeed in 
ending their agony 
i dont think the committee will be able to solve our 
problem said ahmed hasbini a bank employee in moslem west 
beirut 
but i cannot stop hoping that someone somehow will come up 
with a solution at least a truce that would put an end to the 
present round of criminal madness 
rashid makkouk a sunni moslem salesman said of the new 
shelling we were under the impression that this is over at least 
for the time being 
we thought of taking a break from living in the underground 
shelter we started our evening in the apartment 
we were watching television which interrupted programming to 
report that the arab committee has concluded its meeting but no 
ceasefire accord was reached 
i was thinking whether we should return to the shelter when the 
explosion of the first shell echoed we rushed down he said 
now they say a ceasefire will be announced saturday i cant 
believe it anymore i think well spend the winter as well in the 
shelter

rock impresario barry fey has never been to a 
symphony concert and says he prefers the beatles over bach but hes 
still confident he can save the denver symphony orchestra 
hey you dont have to know it to sell it said fey on 
thursday 
rescuing the financially beleaguered denver symphony orchestra 
should be a walk through the park compared to dealing with the 
superegos and supersalaries of such acts as the rolling stones and 
bruce springsteen he said 
these guys are treated bigger than god he said of the greats 
he has brought to denver since launching his career in 1967 by 
presenting the doors 
fey said he would leave it to the members of the provisionally 
renamed colorado symphony orchestra to choose conductors and music 
for a proposed 26week season starting about nov 1 he said 
if i had my druthers id have the beatles the stones the who 
and led zeppelin done by the symphony said fey 
im not a dictator im a messenger i dont tell them what 
they should like i ask what they want and i get it if it 
sells its good 
fey spoke enthusiastically about grofes grand canyon suite 
and tchaikovskys piano concerto no 1 while acknowledging that at 
the age of 50 he has yet to attend a formal symphony concert 
patrons can wear whatever they wish at his symphony concerts 
said fey clad in a chicago cubs sweatshirt white shorts and 
tennis shoes without socks its not what you wear its what you 
hear 
fey filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986 with debts of nearly 
5 million then bounced back with a new partner and a streamlined 
fey concert co 
now he plans to spend 8000 a week to promote the symphony 
he expresses confidence that he can pull of the gamble i only 
need 600 people per concert to cover my expenses he said 
part of his lowoverhead plan to save the orchesatra would pay 
each musician about 22000 a year twice the figure offered by the 
denver symphony association 
the musicians voted earlier this week to hire fey after they were 
offered another proposal that would give them a much lower salary

actress zsa zsa gabor came to court 
today in a rollsroyce and a furious mood calling the policeman who 
arrested her during a traffic stop and everyone else involved in the 
case a liar 
i like men of achievement not a man with a gun i should 
have scratched his eyes out miss gabor who is under court order 
not to talk about the case told reporters outside the courtroom 
where she is on trial on charges of slapping officer paul kramer 
i think that cop is not too bright i think he must be very 
spoiled because hes very sexy hes gorgeous hes sexy but i 
dont like that man said the former beauty queen 
miss gabor is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police 
officer disobeying an officers orders driving with an expired 
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car and an 
expired car registration a conviction carries a maximum two years 
in jail and 4000 fine 
kramer pulled her over on june 14 for having expired registration 
licenses on her 215000 rollsroyce corniche convertible as he 
checked for violations miss gabor allegedly drove off was stopped 
again and slapped kramers face 
the outburst came before a second day of testimony questioned by 
deputy district attorney elden fox and defense attorney william 
graysen kramer had testified thursday that miss gabor cursed spit 
on him and slapped him 
miss gabors diatribe began at the curb outside the courthouse 
where she alighted from the rolls in a trouser outfit of black 
pants blackandwhite polka dot top with a red silk corsage on the 
left shoulder 
this man is the biggest liar and the police department is the 
biggest liar in the world miss gabor charged ignoring pleas from 
her attorney reminding her about the gag order in the case 
the officers a liar and the district attorneys a liar every 
word of it is a lie i was there she said 
hes a vulgar policeman and hes a liar the actress said 
graysen said prior to miss gabors arrival that she was a 
strong woman and shes holding up well 
thursdays testimony featured a recreation of the traffic stop 
that ended in a minor altercation and miss gabors arrest 
officer you promise not to strike my client the defense 
attorney asked in jest at one point 
recounting the incident kramer said miss gabor screamed at him 
do you know who i am 
she closed the door and she spun around and slapped me on the 
side of the face i was very surprised kramer testified 
kramer under crossexamination was asked to stand alongside 
miss gabor as he wore his helmet and sunglasses 
im afraid of him said the 5foot3 actress as she stood 
next to the 6foot4 officer within inches of the jury box on 
thursday smiling she demonstrated a strike to kramers left cheek 
showing it was a considerable reach 
i didnt realize he was so tall he is very gorgeous miss 
gabor said during a break in testimony 
jurors also heard a recorded police radio transmission of miss 
gabors traffic stop and kramers inquiry for a computer check on a 
date of birth for the actress the answer came back as june 6 1923 
an enlarged copy of miss gabors drivers license was displayed to 
jurors and it showed the birthdate had been altered asked why he 
didnt issue a misdemeanor citation for an altered license kramer 
said it was an amateur job of alteration 
fox said witnesses will prove the officers actions were 
professional throughout the 15minute episode 
when she arrived in court thursday miss gabor deflected 
questions about her age which ranges from 62 to 70 depending on 
the source 
the only good thing that comes out of this is my face cream 
sells like hot cakes the former miss hungary and cosmetics 
entrepreneur concluded 
graysen said in his statement that kramer overreacted and miss 
gabor acted in selfdefense 
witnesses will show there is a pattern of excessive force by 
kramer and a coverup of that behavior by the police department he 
said 
hes a bad cop graysen said

iakovos georgudis pleaded guilty aug 16 to one count apiece of 
violating the federal clean water act the agreement called for 
fines of 10000 against georgudis and 500000 that ballard would 
pay to the state for environmental research and acquisition of 
coastal property 
the delay in sentencing also canceled plans for georgudis 43 of 
athens greece to plead guilty and be fined the maximum of 20000 
on state charges of polluting coastal waters and failing to have a 
harbor pilot aboard said thomas connell a spokesman for attorney 
general james e oneil 
torres said he had not received information he had requested 
about the previous environmental record of georgudis ballard and 
its owners 
bradford gorham ballards attorney said the shippers insurers 
promised to cover 32 million in federal environmental damage 1 
million in state cleanup costs and 35 million in unspecified other 
costs such as those incurred by businesses hurt by the spill 
the judge now wants to know more about the people behind 
ballard gorham said im not sure until i talk to my clients 
what that information can be 
john a macfadyen the captains lawyer said it was up to 
ballard to provide the information and he declined to comment 
further 
according to testimony at a coast guard hearing georgudis and a 
helmsman were on the tankers bridge when it ran aground at brenton 
reef about a mile south of newport and ripped two large gashes in 
its hull 
the heating oil that spilled into rhode island sound forced 
beaches to close and killed young fish and lobsters most beaches 
reopened within a week as the oil evaporated or was cleaned up 
georgudis told gov edward d diprete he erred by not waiting for 
a harbor pilot before proceeding into the treacherous waters near 
the mouth of narragansett bay

president bush today lamented the horrible 
loss of life when a man with an assault rifle went on a rampage in a 
louisville ky printing plant but said he still opposes 
legislation to ban such weapons 
if you have somebody who is deranged and i dont want to 
prejudice this poor soul but if he was deranged im afraid youre 
going to have incidents like this bush said 
in a luncheon interview with outoftown reporters the president 
was asked what he would say to the families of the victims of 
thursdays rampage by a man who used a ak47 assault rifle and other 
weapons to shoot 20 of his former coworkers killing seven of them 
and himself 
i would tell them i feel horrible about the loss of life i 
would tell them we must do everything we can to enforce laws that 
are already on the books bush replied 
the president has banned the import of foreignmade assault 
rifles into the united states including the chinesemade ak47 
however possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and bush 
has taken no steps toward proposing curbs on us manufacture of 
such weapons 
bush answered a wide range of questions with a group of reporters 
after a luncheon in the state dining room 
on his antidrug plan he said he was ready to bargain with the 
democraticled congress to come up with a compromise for paying for 
the program 
and while the president said he still prefers his 
administrations formula for funding his 79 billion program 
were flexible 
bush also acknowledged that overlapping responsibilities and 
missions of various law and drug enforcement agencies were sometimes 
getting in the way of effective enforcement 
he said that his drug policy director william j bennett is 
working on better coordination to try to cope with the 
bureaucratic competition that exists i cant tell you weve got it 
whipped i can tell you weve made progress 
the president reiterated his decision not to press for a tax 
increase to help pay for his war on drugs a tax increase would be 
counterproductive he said 
on next weeks education summit with governors in 
charlottesville va bush said were going to have some 
rollupyoursleeves meetings 
he said that overall us educational performance was 
disappointing measured against achievement of students in other 
industrialized nations were getting less in terms of our 
investment he said 
on the subject of guns the president a longtime opponent of 
guncontrol legislation noted that many local government do have 
measures banning automatic and semiautomatic weapons 
bush said thursdays shootings in louisville reminded him as a 
texan of a 1966 incident in which a sniper who occupied a tower on 
the campus of the university of texas in austin shot 44 people 
killing 16 
it is terrible and the loss of human life is horrible but i 
have seen no evidence that a law banning a specific weapon is going 
to guard against it he said 
so my view is do everything you can in terms of education do 
everything you can in terms of enforcing your laws that are on the 
books 
bush recalled that years ago he went to register his own hunting 
guns to comply with a district of columbia law requiring 
registration of all firearms 
he said he asked the clerk if criminals had complied with the 
law and was told in return that no just a bunch of suckers like 
you 
bush also said he was strongly opposed to the legalization of 
drugs and that it would never be given consideration at the federal 
level as long as he was president 
returning to the issue of new taxes for fighting crime and drugs 
the president said that while he wouldnt advocate new federal 
taxes for building new prisons he could understand if state and 
local governments raised taxes 
yes the states and localities are having to step up themselves 
and do stuff thats up to them im not going to criticize a 
governor or a municipality that has to do something on the revenue 
side he said 
im going to try to hold the line as president of the united 
states on federal taxes 
in the only question on international affairs bush was asked if 
the united states should consider diverting us funds from the 
north atlantic treaty organization to help finance the war on drugs 
he said that the united states could not afford to back off its 
military ommitment to nato saying it needs to prudently deal with 
the threat from the soviet union i think im doing whats in the 
national interest of the united states he added

the federal communications commission chairman 
urged the nations broadcasters friday to tune out shock radio 
programs that use sexually and racially oriented humor to attract 
audiences 
we are not simply recorders transmitters and antennas 
alfred sikes told those attending the national association of 
broadcasters radio convention we are what we broadcast 
sikes a former owner of several radio stations said the 
association should revive its programming code dropped in the early 
1980s as the result of a federal antitrust lawsuit against 
provisions regarding commercials 
such standards should be drawn up by the industry without 
government pressure said sikes who took over the fcc chair in 
august 
the fcc on aug 24 said it was taking enforcement action against 
three stations wlupam in chicago ksjofm in san jose calif 
and wfbqfm in indianapolis which may have broadcast indecent 
programs in violation of the law 
the stations were given 30 days to respond to fcc inquiries 
which the agency said were based on a review of public complaints 
according to fcc transcripts the material involved sexually 
oriented humor broadcast during daytime hours 
i know that people say the commissioners were simply responding 
to congressional pressures sikes said but in that regard let 
me say this you really ought to first read the program material 
which we cited and also note that it was being broadcast at a time 
when children almost certainly were listening 
nab president edward fritts said the organization could not 
consider a new code unless congress approves pending legislation 
granting the broadcast industry an antitrust exemption for 
programming content codes

the us trade deficit narrowed to 758 
billion in july its lowest level in nearly five years the 
government said friday but some analysts fear the improvement will 
be temporary if the dollar continues to rise against other 
currencies 
the commerce department said the july deficit dropped 53 percent 
from a revised june imbalance of 801 billion the july gap was the 
slimmest since a 679 billion imbalance in december 1984 
analysts pointed to the export category in the report 
particularly capital goods as the main reason for the deficit 
improvement while exports dropped 18 percent they still totaled a 
strong 3074 billion the fifth straight month that exports have 
remained above 30 billion 
capital goods exports rose 300 million while capital goods 
imports fell 530 million 
that is exactly the type of thing we need to see said howard 
lewis vice president for international economics at the national 
association of manufacturers we dont have a prayer of solving 
our trade problems if we dont have a big turnaround in our capital 
goods balance 
overall imports fell 25 percent to 3832 billion their lowest 
level since february due in part to an unexpectedly small rise in 
oil imports the trade deficit is the difference between imports and 
exports 
many economists had been looking for a deficit of 85 billion to 
9 billion because of increasing oil imports and the rising value of 
the dollar which cuts into exports by making them more expensive 
overseas 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said the export 
volume reflects booming economies overseas but cautioned that the 
going will get tougher as we move to the end of the year and into 
the next 
the reason is he said is that by late in the year the higher 
dollar will be denting exports and the booming economies 
overseas will probably slow down 
but michael k evans of evans economics inc a washington 
consulting firm questioned the impact of the higher dollar 
it used to be that when the dollar rose domestic manufacturers 
threw in the towel saying they couldnt compete at those prices 
he said now a lot of our clients are deciding to stick it out 
they realize their profit margins will be temporarily slashed but 
theyre determined to retain their foothold in the foreign market 
and ride this thing out 
oil imports rose 29 percent to 432 billion in july the amount 
rose to 814 million barrels a day from 793 million in june but 
the price per barrel fell to 1712 from 1767 in june 
analysts say oil imports will continue to rise as us 
consumption increases and domestic production falls becoming a 
major factor in producing a widening deficit in coming months 
the american petroleum institute an industry group reported 
imported oil in july accounted for more than half of monthly us 
petroleum needs the first time that has occurred in 12 years 
the decrease in the july deficit represented the first 
backtoback declines since mid1988 when the imbalances dropped in 
march april and may 
undersecretary of commerce michael r darby said the deficit has 
dropped 103 percent in the first seven months of the year 
including a 151 percent increase in exports and an 84 percent 
increase in imports compared to the same period of 1988 
for the first seven months of 1989 the trade deficit was running 
at an annual rate of 1058 billion down 107 percent from last 
years total deficit of 1185 billion 
the largest deficit in july continued to be with japan an 
imbalance of 404 billion up from a june deficit of 394 billion 
next was taiwan which totaled 126 billion in june while the 
deficit with china was 510 million

president bush said today hes ready to deal 
with democrats on how to pay for the war on drugs declaring were 
flexible in terms of the funding method 
however the president repeated his objections to any proposal 
that includes either a tax increase or deep military spending cuts 
we cant afford to sacrifice our military preparedness bush 
said in a questionandanswer session with a group of outoftown 
reporters he invited to a white house lunch 
the administration has previously voiced opposition to a proposal 
by senate democratic leader robert c byrd of west virginia that it 
claims would make unacceptably sharp cuts in defense spending 
bush indicated he still prefers his own formula for raising the 
717 million in additional spending above the 71 billion he had 
previously proposed for antidrug spending in the fiscal year that 
begins on oct 1 
however as negotiations were set to begin with congressional 
democrats on a compromise bush said were flexible in terms of 
the funding method but i strongly believe that we must retain the 
integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than six 
months to develop 
bush also repeated his opposition to new taxes to pay for the war 
on crime and drugs although he acknowledged that states and some 
local governments might need to raise taxes to help pay for new 
prisons 
thats up to them im not going to criticize a governor or a 
municipality that has to do something on the revenue side bush 
said 
earlier today civil rights leader jesse jackson called bushs 
drug plan inadequate 
i submit that we cannot expect mr bush and drug policy chief 
william bennett to come up with a plan to deal with drugs in our 
community jackson told a house panel the drug war does not 
begin at the white house it begins at our house 
bennett conceded the administration will not likely get the 
budget offsets in the categories bush suggested to fund the drug war 
that doesnt seem to be the game in town right now bennett 
told the reporters at the white house 
he said it was likely what were going to talk about is some 
kind of acrosstheboard reductions rather than taking money out of 
this box and putting it in this box you may see some small fraction 
of a percentage reduction throughout the budget 
jackson and bennett shook hands warmly before addressing the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control but in his 
remarks jackson was critical of both bush and bennett 
in april mr bennett announced that he would take 
comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the 
nations capital jackson said in comments marked by repeated 
applause from spectators as well as a few shouts of approval five 
months later we still have the emergency but no action 
president bush announced a drug plan for bogota colombia 
where is his plan for the district of columbia and cities across the 
nation said jackson who has been mentioned as possible mayoral 
candidate in the capital 
he said more money than the 79 billion envisioned by bush was 
needed to do the job as well as input from community leaders who 
have firsthand experience with fighting the drug problem 
meantime senate negotiations on financing the war on drugs got 
under way with democrats demanding a boost in funding and 
republicans saying more money was less important than quick action 
on the plan 
in the house many lawmakers appeared cool to a proposal from 
sen robert c byrd dwva to gain an additional 22 billion for 
the 79 billion drug war through a halfpercent cut in federal 
programs across the board 
elsewhere thursday bennett got into a sharply worded exchange 
with democrats on the house government operations committee while 
lobbying for the administration plan 
the task force includes nine democrats and nine republicans and 
dole said bennett and bush administration budget director richard 
darman would be in on the talks 
this thing could take a couple of weeks dole said he said 
republicans might freeze senate action on a dozen money bills only 
two weeks from the start of fiscal 1990 unless the negotiations 
produced results 
majority democrats control the senate but the gop could use the 
rules to block the money bills 
byrds proposed acrosstheboard cut remains attached to a money 
bill for transportation programs that is awaiting final action in 
the senate republicans oppose the measure which would delete 18 
billion from the defense departments budget

a former unisys corp executive described 
as a major figure in a defense procurement scandal was sentenced to 
32 months in prison friday for bribing pentagon officials for inside 
information on contract bids 
charles f gardner 59 who admitted bribing former pentagon 
official melvyn paisley by buying a resort condominium at an 
inflated price was fined 40000 after also pleading guilty to 
charges that he set up a slush fund to pay bribes and make illegal 
campaign contributions 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica said gardner used 
slushfund money for a broad spectrum of criminal activity that 
included paying bribes to public officials and making illegal 
campaign contributions to congressmen as well as for his personal 
use 
it was the american taxpayer that ended up footing the bill for 
these activities because gardner billed the pentagon with phony 
invoices to replenish the money aronica said 
james g neal 65 a former unisys consultant described by 
aronica as the banker for mr gardner and mr gardners 
operation was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined 30000 
by us district judge claude hilton 
both were charged as part of the investigation dubbed operation 
ill wind 
aronica who called gardner a major figure in the 
investigation urged hilton to consider the cooperation that both 
gardner and neal had given investigators since their guilty pleas in 
march 
gardner could have received a maximum sentence of 23 years in 
prison and fines of 750000 neal who owes the internal revenue 
service 104000 in back taxes could have been sentenced to 15 
years in prison and fined 750000 
defense lawyer gary naftalis said information provided by gardner 
has already resulted in six guilty pleas and will lead to more and 
more convictions of individuals and corporations 
gardner is apparently providing information about his former 
superiors at sperry corp which became unisys corp after a 
takeover by burroughs corp unisys corp says it is cooperating 
according to court papers gardner arranged in 1986 to have neal 
buy paisleys condominium in sun valley idaho for 49000 more 
than it was sold for a year later 
paisley former assistant navy secretary for research 
engineering and systems has not been charged 
gardner admitted arranging illegal campaign contributions to rep 
roy dyson dmd and the late rep bill chappell dfla both had 
denied knowing the contributions were illegal 
according to court papers in another case gardner a vice 
president and general manager of the companys surveillance and fire 
control systems in great neck ny obtained permission from an 
unidentified superior to bribe a former navy engineer for 
information about an electronics contract 
that official garland l tomlin jr 59 is awaiting sentence 
after pleading guilty to taking 400000 in bribes from sperry corp 
and 75000 from honeywell inc

president bushs smogreduction plan got some 
competition friday as a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a 
rival bill to cut auto pollution and set new deadlines for cities to 
clean their air 
the rival measure strongly backed by majority leader george j 
mitchell dmaine significantly alters he bush approach to 
automobile pollution but takes a similar approach to setting 
cleanup timetables for smogchoked cities 
sen max baucus dmont the bills chief sponsor said the bush 
plan wont get us across the finish line in improving air 
quality and predicted the rival proposal would cut auto emissions 
by 50 percent by the year 2000 
sen john h chafee rri the chief sponsor of the bush 
legislation in the senate also is cosponsoring the baucus 
antismog measure 
in all eight democrats and five republicans are sponsoring the 
rival measure 
asked why hes backing two bills with conflicting provisions 
chafee said he agrees with the baucus approach but he sponsored the 
bush legislation chafee said because he agrees with many of its 
provisions and wanted to support the first effort an 
administration has made in eight years to tackle the nations air 
quality problem 
former president reagan did not propose a comprehensive revision 
to the 1977 cleanair law during his eight years in office 
the proposal introduced friday covers only urban smog proposals 
but any cleanair legislation will also include provisions on 
airborne toxic chemicals and acid rain the bush proposal which 
covers all three areas is now under consideration by the house 
energy and commerce environment subcommittee 
smog is air pollution generated by motor vehicles industry and 
other sources in urban areas a major component is ozone which at 
ground level is produced by the combination of hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides both given off by tailpipes in the presence of 
sunlight and heat 
since 90 percent of the ozone breathed into the lungs is never 
exhaled with ozone molecules reacting with sensitive lung tissue to 
cause a number of health consequences these include chest pains 
shortness of breath coughing nausea throat irritatiion and 
increased susceptibility to respiratory infections 
the automobile section of the baucus bill would like the bush 
measure would tighten current tailpipe antipollution requirements 
but would not include two key elements of the presidents proposal 
a forced switch from todays gasoline to cleanburning motor fuels 
in severely polluted cities and permission for automakers to average 
emissions by engine category to comply with antipollution 
requirements 
instead the senate measure would require each model to meet the 
emissions standards as under current law and would allow 
automakers to choose whether to build cars using alternative fuels 
or reduce pollution in other ways 
the legislation like the bush measure would set deadlines 
ranging from five years to 20 years for cities to clean up their 
smog problems but the placement of cities in the various categories 
would be different 
the bush bill would give los angeles new york houston and 
chicagogary ind 20 years to sharply reduce ozone levels in 
return for adopting severe antipollution measures the baucus 
legislation would place only los angeles in the 20year category and 
would give the other three areas 15 years 
in all 101 geographical areas have failed to meet the 
nowexpired ozone cleanup timetables under current law 
baucus explaining the lack of an alternative fuels requirement 
in his bill said i dont think its wise to mandate change in 
the marketplace so that certain users have to use certain kinds of 
cars 
he also called the requirement a heavyhanded intrusion into 
the marketplace 
the bush administration on the other hand calls its clean fuels 
requirement the most innovative and farreaching component of 
its ozonecutting proposals 
the president would force a portion of the car fleet in the most 
seriously polluted cities to operate on cleanburning fuels such as 
methanol ethanol natural gas electricity propane or reformulated 
gasoline 
the president wants a schedule for such vehicles beginning with 
500000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year and going up to 
one million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004 
im not sure how you get people to buy that number of cars 
chafee said

rock star sting suffered the slings and arrows 
of outraged theater critics friday for his stage debut in the 
threepenny opera but he was a smash hit with the soviet 
ambassador and yulia sukhanova the soviet unions first beauty 
queen 
with president and mrs bush watching from box seats above the 
national theater stage thursday night sting made the best of a 
daunting threehour performance as mack the knife in the 
prebroadway premiere of bertolt brechts biting musical satire 
the critics however agreed that stings best wasnt good enough 
slow and turgid stuff complained the washington posts david 
richards who said stings acting has little resonance and his 
singing voice is surprisingly thin 
if youre going to see sting prepare to be stung said hap 
erstein of the washington times who said this threepenny opera 
proved to not be worth 2 cents despite a stellar cast directed 
by tony award winner john dexter and music conducted by julius rudel 
many in the blacktie opening night audience agreed that sting 
who is accustomed to megadecibel amplifiers at his huge stadium 
rock concerts desperately needs a body mike for kurt weills bawdy 
songs in the intimate confines of a legitimate theater like the 
national 
sting himself nearly crushed in the melee of fans at a 
postperformance party at the old ebbitt grill was pleased that 
bush came backstage at the second intermission to greet the cast 
he said he enjoyed the show and so did barbara sting 
reported 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin joined bush backstage and the 
curtain for the final act was delayed when the two men stepped aside 
for an animated conversation alone 
we didnt know if we were going to have a peace treaty ending 
the cold war or a third act said one cast member later 
dubinin clearly enjoying the show said brechts plays are 
popular in the soviet union and that the threepenny opera often 
is performed there in russian 
its the truth about life he said smilingly acknowledging 
that brecht was an outspoken marxist who rewrote the 18th century 
english satire the beggars opera to espouse his political 
theories about religion sex and morality in capitalist society 
dubinin said thursday nights performance in a fresh english 
translation by michael feingold brought an american spirit to the 
spirit of brechts epoch that is a good combination of the two 
the ambassadors companion for the evening was miss sukhanova a 
17yearold model and budding actress who recently was graduated 
from a moscow high school for the arts she was elected miss 
ussr in june during a beauty pageant in which soviet 
television viewers called in their votes by telephone 
miss sukhanova said she became a sting fan when saw a television 
broadcast of the former lead singer and songwriter for the defunct 
rock group police performing last year at a moscow stadium concert 
im not really in love with him but i like him very much 
she said through an interpreter at a postperformance party at the 
old ebbitt grill also attended by members of congress lynda johnson 
robb actress kelly mcgillis and other celebrities 
miss sukhanova managed to slip past other admirers crowding 
around stings table including sen albert gore dtenn and his 
16yearold daughter karenna to shake hands with her singing idol 
she said she blushed just a little when sting gave her a 
compliment shes too shy to say the interpreter said but he 
told her she was very beautiful 
feingold said there have been three movies and no fewer than six 
translations or adaptations of threepenny opera for the stage 
but this is the most faithful recreation of the original uncut 
version of the brechtweill musical play of 1928 
the show will open at the luntfontanne theater in new york on 
nov 5 after a fourweek run at the national 
weve got a lot of work to do conceded producer jerry 
hellman who also is making his theatrical debut after a string of 
movie hits

the only police action reported was against white hecklers 
police watched from nearly every window of their 12story

protesters singing and carrying banners stopped nearby 
six clergymen went to the door of the building to present a 
petition against the use of police to stop peaceful protests

the south african council of churches was allowed inside the 
building where he says he has twice been tortured during 
interrogation 
the little space they have opened to give us the chance to show 
how peaceful we are has been used quite effectively chikane said 
later 
in the capital of pretoria about 2000 people gathered in the 
central church square where police never had allowed protests to 
take place black youths chanting viva trotted around the 
squares lawn while about 60 police watched 
several demonstrators carrying banners reading stop police 
brutality and victory is certain even climbed on a statue of 
paul kruger one of the political patriarchs of the afrikaners who 
now control the government 
a rightwing proapartheid party leader jaap marais called the 
climbing on the statue a desecration 
until this week virtually all protest marches had been 
prohibited but de klerk said tuesday he would allow peaceful 
protests and the next day more than 20000 people streamed through 
cape town to protest police brutality 
it was the largest such demonstration to be authorized by the 
government magistrates also granted approval for the protests 
friday 
in carrying out his policy to allow peaceful protest de klerk 
faces opposition not only from rightwing parties but from the 
security establishment that enjoyed wide powers under his 
predecessor pw botha 
de klerks conservative opponents in parliament on thursday 
denounced his move saying it undercut security officials 
the independent south african press association said of fridays 
protests a potentially explosive mass demonstration by mainly 
blacks in one of afrikaner nationalisms citadels had gone off 
without a hitch 
smaller demonstrations also were held in the cities of port 
elizabeth and grahamstown 
one swallow doesnt make a summer neither do two or three 
freedom marches make a liberated country methodist bishop peter 
storey told a news conference after the johannesburg march 
he said the government should see the wisdom of negotiating with 
people who can mount an enormous march like that in a very tense 
situation in a polarized society 
the petition the clergymen presented to police demanded an end to 
discriminatory and restrictive laws so that negotiations can begin 
on ending apartheid which denies the nations black majority a 
voice in national affairs 
the johannesburg marchers included black youths white 
professionals nuns and prominent activists including winnie 
mandela wife of jailed black nationalist nelson mandela 
many youths carried posters demanding mandelas release and 
chanted anc anc the initials of mandelas outlawed african 
national congress movement 
about 10000 marchers began the protest but the crowd swelled as 
spectators joined the passing parade chikane said he was 
particularly pleased that white office workers stepped off the 
sidewalks to join hands with blacks 
he said the police officer who accepted the marchers petition 
was a bit tense 
obviously they are frightened by this new reality i 
believe some of the policemen were shocked they have been told not 
to allow this and they dont understand when they are told not to 
take action he said 
when chikane emerged from the station he and storey climbed a 
ladder to speak to the crowd from a concrete ledge and told the 
marchers to disperse telling them we have proved our point 
the crowd joined storey in a prayer sang god bless africa 
the anthem of the antiapartheid movement and dispersed 
several thousand youths jogged and chanted anc slogans on their 
way to bus and train stations to return home 
traffic officers cordoned off side streets as the 10blocklong 
procession marched more than a mile from st marys anglican 
cathedral down streets that normally would have been clogged with 
traffic 
pretoria police led away two men shouting abuse at the protesters 
and johannesburg officers warned a white man who threw eggs at the 
parade 
de klerk was elected to a fiveyear term thursday by the 
electoral college which is dominated by his national party he had 
been acting president since aug 15 a day after he and other 
cabinet members pressured botha to resign

national league of cities president terry 
goddard said friday the federal drugfighting budget for 1990 should 
be increased by 5 billion to 6 billion over the administrations 
proposed 79 billion and that taxes should be raised to pay for it 
new resources are needed said the mayor of phoenix ariz and 
i havent figured out another way to get new resources 
commenting on president bushs oftstated opposition to new taxes 
read my lips no new taxes goddard said some of us are 
illiterate 
the democratic mayor said the strategy will call on state and 
local governments to spend 10 billion to 12 billion for drug 
testing and prisons next year alone we believe that an equivalent 
resource from the federal government has got to be committed he 
said 
weve just gone through a bailout of the savings and loans 
where really no questions were asked and the money simply 
appeared he said 
we are at the same level of urgency or significantly greater 
level of urgency because people are dying he said im not 
sure anybody died in the savings and loans in fact im pretty sure 
they didnt 
goddard who was meeting with bush friday afternoon said paying 
for the strategy by taking funds away from immigration juvenile 
justice and housing programs is a shell game 
he likened such a rearrangement of resources to asking dwight 
eisenhower to finance the normandy invasion by selling his landing 
craft those programs are important to establishing a climate in our 
cities which will keep drugs at bay 
goddard called for a significant amount to be allocated 
directly to cities so they wouldnt run into a logjam of state 
bureaucracies but he declined to say how much money the cities 
should get 
he said he is asking municipal leaders to lobby capitol hill 
where some members of congress already are balking at a proposal by 
sen robert c byrd dwva to increase the 79 billion by 22 
billion

house taxwriters narrow approval of a capital 
gains tax cut sought by president bush sets the stage for the first 
major leadership test of new house speaker thomas s foley jr and 
his top democratic deputies 
over vehement objections from foley and other party leaders six 
democrats on the house ways and means committee joined 13 
republicans in a 1917 vote thursday to cut the tax 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill called his panels 
action a financial disaster and ultimate expression of feel 
good economics that could unravel the rateequalizing 
loopholeclosing tax reforms of 1986 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are pleased by 
the vote and we will be working hard to sustain it on the floor 
the plan approved by the committee would reduce the tax rate of 
33 percent to 196 percent for the next 27 months the tax rate then 
would rise to 28 percent but would be indexed to tax only 
increases exceeding the annual inflation rate 
the net effect to taxpayers is similar to bushs campaign 
proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent without 
indexing 
the ways and means budget bill also lowers the premiums for 
catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and finances a massive 
increase in childcare subsidies for lowincome families the 1990 
fiscal year begins oct 1 
the six democrats led by reps ed jenkins of georgia and jj 
pickle of texas resisted weeks of entreaties from foley and house 
democratic leader richard gephardt of missouri that the proposal is 
little more than a giveaway to the rich 
the notion that wealthy americans need another tax break at the 
expense of working people is ludicrous gephardt said whos 
going to pay the answer is the ordinary middleincome working 
american thats who 
because the wealthy own most capital assets such as stocks 
bonds and real estate they would benefit the most from the tax 
break the joint committee on taxation estimated that 80 percent of 
the 4 billion to 5 billion in benefits will go to taxpayers with 
incomes above 100000 a year 
supporters contend a capital gains tax cut would help the economy 
by encouraging investment 
cutting the capital gains rate would bring in more tax money for 
the next three years by provding incentives to sell such assets 
according to government estimates however after that the reduction 
would cost the treasury 28 billion to 5 billion a year according 
to the joint committee on taxation 
rostenkowski expressed bitter frustration that onefourth of his 
committees democrats sided with the 13 republicans to give them a 
majority on more than a halfdozen votes aimed at whittling down the 
capital gains amendment cosponsored by jenkins and rep bill archer 
rtexas 
if the evident divisions within the committee are any 
indication the house is in for a painful fight said rostenkowski 
democrats voting with jenkins and pickle for the tax cut were 
reps mike andrews of texas beryl anthony of arkansas andrew 
jacobs of indiana and ronnie flippo of alabama 
republicans predicted they would pick up as many as 70 of the 
houses 255 democrats when the legislation moves to the house floor 
late this month 
other democrats said it will take a carefully orchestrated 
campaign for a positive counterproposal to stop the momentum for 
giving bush what he wants 
there has to be a response from our partys perspective other 
than just being against said rep brian j donnelly dmass 
this will be foleys first real major decision 
gephardt said the democrats were looking at a variety of 
alternatives including raising the tax rate on high incomes and a 
plan advanced by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas to partially restore 
tax deductions on contributions to individual retirement accounts 
the changes in the medicare catastrophic health insurance plan 
and new child benefits were informally approved earlier 
over five years lowerincome families would receive an 
additional 14 billion in tax credits and 2 billion in 
stateadministered grants aimed at improving child care for working 
parents 
the major part of the increase would come from liberalizing the 
earnedincome credit which benefits lowerincome working families 
with children the credit would be worth more to larger families it 
could range up to 1790 a year for those with three or more 
children a new credit of up to 430 a year would help families with 
children under the age of 6 
in response to complaints from many retirees the surtax 
financing catastrophic health insurance would be cut in half for the 
wealthiest 40 percent of retirees but the flat monthly premium paid 
by all but the poorest medicare beneficiaries would rise 
the bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage 
but only if they opt out of medicare part b which pays physicians 
fees

counterintelligence officials said 
friday they are worried communist east germany may have slipped 
spies among refugees coming from hungary and they promised to help 
any spies who turn themselves in 
west germany has been a playground for spies since the advent of 
the cold war with agents from several east bloc countries snooping 
around for nato military secrets and sensitive hightech knowhow 
some of the hundreds of spies caught in the past were east 
germans who came over to west germany either as escapees or as legal 
emigres 
peter frisch vice president of west germanys main 
counterintelligence agency the constitutional protection office 
said there may have been agents or wouldbe agents among the recent 
flood of east german refugees to the west 
this is a possibility we must reckon with its something we 
must be alert to said frisch 
he appealed to any east german refugees who have obligated 
themselves to east german intelligence to telephone the 
constitutional protection office in cologne we can help them 
he said 
frisch said that even if a refugee had committed himself to spy 
for east germany he would not be prosecuted if he had not yet begun 
his work 
intelligence officials say dramatically reduced eastwest 
tensions have not reduced east bloc espionage sixty suspected spies 
were nabbed in west germany last year compared with 34 the year 
before 
a 69yearold man was arrested last month for allegedly acting as 
an east german informer more than 30 years 
some of the worlds most famous spy scandals have erupted in west 
germany such as the 1974 exposure of guenter guillaume a close 
adviser to thenchancellor willy brandt as an east german agent 
the disclosure shocked the nation and resulted in brandts 
resignation 
there also have been instances of socalled romeo spies 
coming to west germany from the east and building a seemingly 
innocent life with a respectable job but at some point romancing 
government secretaries exchanging love and companionship for 
secrets 
west german intelligence officials say they have no indications 
there are spies among the estimated 14000 east germans who arrived 
in the past week but that the possibility cannot be excluded 
hansgert lange spokesman for the constitutional protection 
office said that sometimes east germans who ask to leave for the 
west are first coerced into making deals with east german 
intelligence 
permission to leave would be dependent on making an agreement 
if they climb to important positions in the west where they might 
be useful the agreement could be activated he said

industrial production recorded its biggest gain 
in four months in august the government said friday in a report 
that drew mixed reaction to the 03 percent gain 
the federal reserve board said the august production rate 
followed revised increases of 01 percent in july and 02 percent in 
june after remaining flat in may 
the fed originally had reported production rose 02 percent in 
july but fell 01 percent in both may and june production was up 
07 percent in april 
thats not only stronger than expected but the revisions were 
substantial the economy never really slowed down said michael k 
evans of evans economics inc a washington consulting firm 
however william k macreynolds forecasting director of the us 
chamber of commerce said the gain was only 28 percent over august 
of last year after rising 57 percent in 1988 
growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish throughout 
1989 falling farther behind the growth in the services sector he 
said 
the fed credited almost all the august growth to a rebound in 
production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining following a 
strike 
excluding motor vehicles output of both consumer goods and 
business equipment was sluggish during the summer it said 
at the same time the central bank reported that the operating 
rate of the nations factories mines and utilities remained 
unchanged at 838 percent of capacity in august the operating rate 
measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels 
factory use had declined 01 percentage point in june the 
central bank said the rate had hit a 10year high of 843 percent 
in december 1988 and last january last months operating rate also 
was unchanged from august 1988 
unchanged capacity utilization in august signals the likelihood 
that inflationary pressures have declined substantially in the last 
several months macreynolds said 
the closer us industry gets to full operating capacity the 
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading 
to shortages and price increases analysts generally consider an 
operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of 
inflationary pressures 
the federal reserve has been walking a fine line of keeping 
interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without 
slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession 
industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable 
and nondurable goods rose 02 percent last month after remaining 
flat in july and increasing 03 percent in june output was up 23 
percent at mines and oil wells but fell 1 percent at utilities 
the fed said its industrial production index in august stood at 
1424 percent of its 1977 base up from 142 percent in july 
at the same time the operating rate rose 01 percentage point to 
84 percent at manufacturing plants the rate had peaked at 847 
percent in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years rose 02 percentage point 
to 826 percent the rate at factories producing nondurable goods 
fell from 864 percent in july to 861 percent in august

a senior east german official said 
friday the exodus of east germans to the west is hurting his 
countrys economy 
opposition leaders formed a new organization to challenge the 
hardline communist government 
east germany accused bonn of enticing the refugees and compared 
it to the home to the reich slogan used during the nazi 
expansionism in the 1930s 
despite appeals for reforms to slow the refugee flow east 
germany has hardened its stance 
that included the cancellation friday of a planned visit by west 
germanys leftleaning social democrats who traditionally have 
pleaded for better relations with east berlin president horst 
sindermann accused the social democrats of planning a 
confrontation next week with the communist government 
most of the east germans who have left since hungary opened its 
border to the west at midnight sunday are young welleducated 
people 
east german central committee member harry tisch said the 
goverment will have to find ways to bridge the gap resulting from 
their loss 
it certainly wont be easy tisch said during a visit to 
stuttgart naturally its not unproblematical for us that skilled 
workers whether young or old from the german democratic republic 
are resettling in the federal republic of germany 
tisch who heads the 95million member state labor union 
claimed there were no official plans to restrict east germans 
travels to hungary however sources in east berlin have said that 
it has become more difficult to get permission to travel to east 
germanys warsaw pact ally 
also friday 12 well known opposition leaders including 
physicist hansjuergen fischbeck announced the formation of the 
citizens initiative for democracy now 
the group signed a petition demanding widespread reforms 
nationwide 
the central committee member in charge of the east german economy 
rejected all such calls including those coming from the west german 
government and the social democrats 
the reform proposals of those people contain only one point 
they want the type of reform that does away with socialism the 
official guenter mittag wrote in the communist party daily 
newspaper neues deutschland it just wont be that way 
he called on those left behind to do everything possible to 
strengthen the nation 
mittag also bitterly attacked west germany 
with promises enticements and also with psychological 
pressure they have organized a movement along the well known model 
of home to the reich mittag wrote have they forgotten what 
that led to 
home to the reich was used as a slogan for the nazis aims to 
unite all germans living in central europe and eastern europe into 
adolf hitlers third reich

the senate deliberating less than an hour 
approved a 77 billion military construction bill friday that 
eliminates president bushs request for work on bases in south korea 
and the philippines 
the best way to make our defense dollar go further is to secure 
a more equitable burden sharing from our allies sen jim sasser 
dtenn chairman of the senate appropriations subcommitte on 
military construction said prior to the chambers overwhelming 
approval of the bill 
the vote was 931 with sen mark hatfield rore the lone 
dissenter 
overall the bill covering the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
provides 13 billion less than this years level for military 
construction and about 300 million less than bush had requested 
the senate blueprint also differs from the house version which 
totals 87 billion including 500 million for base closings that 
the senate has put in the separate defense appropriations bill 
members of the senate and the house will meet later this month to 
fashion a compromise 
prior to the vote sasser told his colleagues that uncertainity 
regarding the level of us forces overseas led to major cuts in the 
legislation 
this bill provides for no new military construction on the 
korean peninsula due to disputes and discussions its unwise to 
move forward with any new construction sasser said 
the legislation cuts 855 million from the 863 million bush 
requested for south korea the house earmarked 742 million for 
construction there 
several members of congress have called for reductions in the 
43000 us personnel stationed in south korea 
sens bennett johnston dla and dale bumpers dark on 
thursday proposed a reduction of 3000 troops during committee 
consideration of the defense spending bill but later withdrew their 
amendment the lawmakers indicated they would introduce the measure 
when the full senate took up the bill 
the united states spends 26 billion a year to maintain its 
troops in south korea 
sasser said the decision to cut all 408 million the president 
requested for the philippines was based on upcoming negotiations on 
a new treaty to replace the military bases agreement 
the usphilippines pact under which the united states leases 
clark air base and subic bay naval base will expire in september 
1991 
philippine president corazon aquino has refused to say whether 
she favors keeping the us bases but a philippine senate 
resolution introduced last month seeks to close the bases 
mrs aquino is expected to discuss the issue when she visits 
washington in november 
while cutting money for overseas projects the subcommittee added 
250 million to the bill for the national guard and reserves in the 
united states bush had requested 4526 million 
the subcommittee also cut 50 million from the presidents 
request of 1015 million for housing the b2 stealth bomber at the 
whiteman air force base in missouri the reduction mirrors the 
action taken in the authorization bill and reflects the delay in the 
program 
sasser in recommending approval of the legislation said the 
bill continues the priorities adopted over the last several years 
and provides adequately for our most pressing military construction 
needs

nobel laureate mother teresa may have 
developed an infection that poses a new danger to her health 
following a heart attack last week her cardiologist said friday 
another doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said too many 
visitors and doctors may be hampering mother teresas chances for 
recovery 
dr vincenzo bilotta a heart specialist from rome and a longtime 
friend of mother teresa said the 79yearold roman catholic nun is 
fighting a persistent fever and chest pains 
with the high temperature her condition is still serious 
said bilotta who treated mother teresa for a similar ailment in 
1985 
her heart is very weak the infection is now posing a new 
danger to her he added without saying where the infection may 
have developed 
dr george lombardi an infectious disease specialist from 
cornell university in new york said doctors are trying to find the 
cause of the infection 
lombardi and bilotta flew to calcutta earlier in the week to help 
treat mother teresa who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1979 
for her devotion to the destitute and dying

the precarious peace talks between his organization and the marxist 
government of jose eduardo dos santos 
he is also expected to discuss the terms of the truce accord and

pullout of an estimated 50000 cuban troops from angola 
unita and the government agreed on a truce to end their 14year 
war at a meeting in gbadolite zaire last june but the ceasefire 
collapsed soon after and hundreds have died in the ensuing clashes 
the agreement has also been endangered by questions about 
savimbis fate angola contends savimbi agreed to go into temporary 
exile and integrate his troops into the angolan military but 
savimbi denied this and accused the angolans of lying about the 
closeddoor meeting in gbadolite zaire

the negotiating table and a meeting has been scheduled for monday in 
kinshasa assistant secretary of state herman cohen was in zaire 
this week to help arrange the meeting

military and financial support of unita until a final peace 
agreement is reached which allows free elections 
the soviet union which backs the government in luanda has also 
pledged its support until peace is achieved

sovietsponsored agreement signed last december for the pullout of 
some 50000 cuban troops from angola the pullout has been conducted 
according to plan and is expected to be completed on schedule in 
1991

a house panel began considering a bill friday 
that would require health inspection of fish and shellfish the 
first effort to establish a comprehensive program to regulate the 
fishing industry 
currently many consumers are wary about the safety of fish 
said rep henry waxman dcalif who introduced the bill they 
have heard many stories about contamination from toxic industrial 
and agricultural chemicals medical waste products and red tides 
the fish and fish products safety act of 1989 would require 
setting safety standards for contaminants for fish and establishing 
a rigorous and comprehensive inspection system 
officials say it is more difficult to regulate fishing than the 
meat or poultry industry because there are 300 edible species of 
fish in vast waters 
contaminants for fish and shellfish include the botulism toxin 
salmonella bacteria and the hepatitisa virus as well as pcbs and 
other industrial contaminants 
dr frank young head of the food and drug administration 
testified before waxmans house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health and the environment that fish consumption increased to 154 
pounds person in 1987 largely because the food is low in fat 
young said the fda inspects only a quarter of the fishprocessing 
plants each year he said data from the federal centers for disease 
control indicate that seafood does not cause illness in alarming 
amounts or diversity 
however ellen haas of public voice a nonprofit group that 
deals with food safety issues disagreed 
she offered a cdc study that indicated that the risk of a food 
poisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater from 
seafood than from beef and 16 times greater than for either chicken 
or pork 
dr lester m crawford administrator of the food safety and 
inspection service at the agriculture department said that 
building on the existing meat and poultry inspection program 
structure would provide a faster start up and extensive costsavings 
for a fish and seafood inspection program 
legislation has been introduced in the past to give the 
agriculture department authority over seafood inspections just as 
it is in charge of meat and poultry inspections the waxman bill 
would make the fda the lead agency 
waxman said in his opening statement friday that the most 
contentious issue has become one of turf where authority over the 
new fish inspection program should be vested

president bush promised friday to be flexible 
amid democratic demands for a boost in drug war spending while the 
rev jesse l jackson said the plan fails to match the breadth of 
this social crisis 
bush told reporters after a luncheon in the state dining room 
that he still prefers the 79 billion drug war he unveiled on 
national television last week but added were flexible 
jackson testifying on capitol hill told lawmakers that the 
bush plan does not wage war on material and spiritual poverty 
which are the preconditions for the drug crisis 
he said the plan underestimates the arsenals of drug dealers 
lacks sufficient funds and needs input from national and community 
leaders with extensive experience in fighting the drug problem 
their remarks cae as senate negotiators of both parties met for 
two hours and broke reporting progress in the quest for a financing 
compromise 
it was a good step senate appropriations committee chairman 
robert c byrd dwva told a news conference following the 
meeting 
at this point i would say that everything is very much on the 
table sen mark hatfield rore said 
but a byrd plan to generate an additional 22 billion for the 
drug war with a halfpercent acrosstheboard cut in federal 
programs opposed by the administration remained part of a 
transportation bill awaiting final action 
the administration is opposed to the cut which would slice 18 
billion out of the defense departments budget 
hatfield said republicans would present an alternative financing 
plan when the 18member negotiating task force returns to the 
bargaining table monday 
repeated applause and a few shouts of approval from spectators 
marked jacksons testimony before the house select committee on 
narcotics 
we need a new initiative equal to the scope and depth of the 
problem the former democratic presidential hopeful said 
jackson shook hands warmly with national drug policy director 
william j bennett who preceded him as a witness at the hearing 
but his remarks were sharply critical of both bennett and bush 
in april mr bennett announced that he would take 
comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the 
nations capital he said five months later we still have the 
emergency but no action 
president bush announced a drug plan for bogota colombia 
where is his plan for the district of columbia and cities around the 
nation said jackson who is believed to be weighing a race for 
mayor of washington 
jackson suggested that the president should convene a meeting at 
camp david to draft a new policy on drugs and include national and 
community leaders with experience in fighting the problem including 
himself 
he also said the nations capital could become a model for 
fighting the drug scourge asked what his own role in that project 
would be he said a volunteer

the letter from grigory v romanov former leningrad communist 
party chief was his first publication in the official press since 
he was retired from the politburo on july 1 1985 less than four 
months after gorbachev became party chief 
rumors of corruption followed the 66yearold romanov to moscow 
when he became a member of the communist partys ruling body in 
1976 but he was considered gorbachevs leading challenger when the 
current soviet leader assumed power 
according to one widespread rumor romanov held his daughters 
wedding in one of the former czarist capitals palaces while he was 
leningrad party chief and took the czars tableware from the 
hermitage museum for the wedding dinner

the crew of space shuttle atlantis 
concluded a twoday countdown rehearsal friday and traveled to 
washington for a meeting with vice president dan quayle 
the practice session intended to mimic the 24 hours leading to 
an actual launch went smoothly despite two computer glitches that 
delayed the end of the countdown nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said 
soon after wrapping up the rehearsal the five astronauts boarded 
their t38 jets for a flight to washington white house officials 
said quayle planned to meet commander don williams and his crewmates 
saturday at breakfast williams comes from quayles home state of 
indiana 
mr quayle expressed a desire to say hello to the crew sometime 
before we fly williams told reporters thursday i invited him 
to be a launch guest but well be pretty busy and wont be able to 
visit with him on launch morning 
the rehearsal ended at 1110 am edt about 10 minutes later 
than planned because launch crews needed extra time to investigate 
two problems in computers monitoring the shuttles systems 
the astronauts and their support crews carried the dress 
rehearsal to its finish even though stormy weather near the kennedy 
space center would have prevented an actual liftoff 
atlantis liftoff is tentatively scheduled for oct 12 the 
national aeronautics and space administration will not set a firm 
date until a twoday flight readiness review is completed oct 3 
the astronauts were aboard atlantis for the final two hours of 
the countdown during the dry run in addition to williams the crew 
members are pilot mike mccully and mission specialists ellen baker 
franklin chang diaz and shannon lucid 
during the first day of the fiveday flight the astronauts are 
to dispatch the nuclearpowered galileo spacecraft on the start of a 
sixyear voyage to explore jupiter and its moons 
antinuclear activists have said they will try to block the 
launch either by court action or by trespassing at the launch site 
because the probe is powered by two generators fueled by 
plutonium238 they are afraid an accident during launch would 
sprinkle hazardous radioactive fallout on communities surrounding 
the kennedy space center 
similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power on 22 
previous us space flights including the six manned apollo moon 
missions and the voyager 2 probe which recently sent back pictures 
of the planet neptune 
the five astronauts on the mission say they are confident the 
nuclear generators are safe

house democratic leaders on friday began a 
struggle to recoup from their loss to president bush on his capital 
gains tax cut portraying their position as a fight for the working 
class 
but conservative democrats said their leaders were choosing the 
wrong issue and republicans eagerly tried to exploit the rift in 
the majority partys ranks 
in a 1917 vote on thursday the house ways and means committee 
approved a capital gains tax cut after six democrats defected and 
went against their party to side with the president 
democratic leaders on friday made clear that they would take the 
fight to the full house and that they hoped the public would be on 
their side after deciding who would win and who would lose if the 
tax cut is approved 
they said they hadnt settled on what kind of alternative to 
offer but among the possibilities was including a restoration of 
individual retirement account tax breaks as first proposed by sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the issue has emerged as the thorniest in a massive budget bill 
that also includes the sensitive issues of child care and revision 
of the tax for medicare catastrophic illness coverage 
strategists involved in the situation were pondering the 
possibility that the whole bill might collapse if forces opposed to 
various provisions combined to bring it down 
rep steny hoyer dmd chairman of the house democratic caucus 
said the cut was at the wrong time giving relief to the wrong 
people its obviously a benefit that will be largely enjoyed by the 
150to200thousandplus crowd 
reminded that michael dukakis tried unsuccessfully to make a 
campaign issue out of bushs support of a capital gains cut hoyer 
still said my gut tells me the average american agrees with our 
position 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo who ran for the 
democratic presidential nomination last year based on populist 
themes was leading the rhetorical attack for the democratic leaders 
george bush wants to give a tax cut to the wealthy and send 
the bill to average working americans he said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash facing the toughest test 
yet of his threemonthold tenure put his deputies to work crafting 
an alternative to offer on the house floor when debate begins later 
this month 
but rep ed jenkins dga who cosponsored the version of the 
capital gains cut approved by the committee said it wasnt just 
republicans who thought the proposal was a good one for all 
taxpayers one that would spur investment and improve the economy 
his own partys leaders he said were making a terrible 
mistake by portraying capital gains as a partisan issue if 
enough democrats will continue to support it and get out front we 
can save the party from itself he said 
republicans saw the democratic division as a return to the 
politics early in president reagans first term when republicans 
could team up with boll weevil southern democrats to push 
through parts of the presidents program 
rep newt gingrich rga the house minority whip spoke friday 
of the common sense coalition of democrats and republicans 
he and hoyer both said there would be a tough fight on the house 
floor 
the capital gains plan approved thursday would cut the current 
maximum rate of 33 percent to 196 percent for 27 months 
thereafter the rate would rise to 28 percent but any gains would be 
taxed only on the amount exceeding the annual inflation rate 
bush in his campaign promised to fight for a 15 percent rate 
but the net effect on taxpayers of the house proposal is similar to 
that because of the indexing for inflation the white house 
immediately announced the president would fight for the 
committeeapproved plan 
the fight is likely to be a muddy one because the capital gains 
provision is part of a huge budget bill that includes some of this 
years toughest issues with more battles almost certain on each 
one 
the bill would provide lowerincome families additional tax 
credits and stateadministered grants to help working parents find 
child care liberals and conservatives want to move the final 
version in opposite directions 
in response to a rash of complaints the bill would halve the 
surtax financing catastrophic health insurance for the wealthiest 40 
percent of retirees but the flat monthly premium paid by all but 
the poorest medicare beneficiaries would rise 
the bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage 
but only if they opt out of medicare part b which pays physicians 
fees 
but many in congress want to repeal the law altogether and the 
showdown on that issue could come on this bill 
other issues include new restrictions on dialaporn 
telephone services on the fairness doctrine to require broadcasters 
to give time to opposing views on expansion of the medicaid health 
program for the poor and a variety of new tax provisions affecting 
businesses

gov michael s dukakis said friday he hasnt read 
a book about his 1988 presidential run that says he retreated into 
a twomonth shell after a flap that rocked his campaign in 
september 1987 
the incident that forced the resignation of campaign manager john 
sasso a close friend and adviser to dukakis was described in all 
by myself a book written by boston globe reporters christine m 
black and thomas oliphant 
he missed sasso personally and politically and worried about 
him they wrote of the democratic candidate and said he became 
flat as a pancake out on the hustings 
dukakis glum mood was also reflected in an almost petulant 
unwillingness to try new material in his speeches according to 
the account 
i havent read it i think its clear we did a good job winning 
the nomination and not as good a job winning the final theres no 
sense crying over spilt milk dukakis said in a brief interview 
during an international trade conference at the statehouse 
he said he is concentrating on his responsibilities as governor 
and not rehashing the campaign 
i spent most of yesterday preparing for the education summit 
dukakis said referring to the meeting later this month of the 
nations governors and president bush the republican who defeated 
him 
the book quoted susan estrich who replaced sasso as campaign 
manager as saying dukakis would return from the road convinced 
that no one liked him estrich was described as bothered by his 
mopey moods while campaign chairman paul brountas said the 
candidate entered a twomonth shell 
sasso was forced to resign in september 1987 after it was 
disclosed that he had secretly distributed a videotape showing that 
sen joseph biden jr of delaware a dukakis rival for the 
democratic nomination was appropriating as his own campaign 
speeches made by british labor party leader neil kinnock 
sasso acted without the knowledge of dukakis who publicly denied 
his campaign had any role in providing the videotape 
the account also described how dukakis repeatedly rejected 
appeals from campaign aides to go on the attack against bush the 
book outlined an advertising effort that at one point produced 1200 
unused scripts for commercials 
although he once had a doubledigit lead over bush in the polls 
dukakis found himself trailing after the republican national 
convention in august 1988 
it wasnt until the closing days of the campaign that dukakis 
went on the attack using the populist theme im on your side 
he closed the gap somewhat but on election day bush carried 40 
states

about 32 milllion of cocaine hidden 
in containers of asphalt was seized and eight people arrested when 
dutch authorities intercepted a drug shipment from south america 
law enforcement officials said friday 
among those arrested were three colombians and a belgian but 
dutch officials declined to further identify the suspects 
the arrests thursday night capped six months of detective work 
and coincided with the delivery of the drugs which were concealed 
in 21 barrels of asphalt at an abandoned dairy plant near this 
southern city according to police spokesman carel bouwman 
it was not immediately where the cocaine originated but bouwman 
said it crossed the atlantic aboard a venezuelan container ship that 
arrived earlier this month in antwerp a belgian port 30 miles from 
tilburg 
the drug bust was one of the biggest in the netherlands this year 
in april 310 pounds of cocaine was seized at amsterdams 
schiphol airport while earlier this year west german authorities 
confiscated 1430 pounds of the drug in munich bouwman said

a jury of teenagers let two boys walk on 
charges of stealing a bicycle but convicted two others of automobile 
theft in a courtroom experiment to let young scofflaws be judged by 
their peers 
circuit judge maynard swanson jr had the final say thursday and 
partially disagreed with the verdicts of the sixmember jury from 
zephyrhills high school it was the first of semimonthly sessions 
endorsed by judges educators and pasco county officials 
the jury volunteers from a class on the law deliberated about 
20 minutes before finding a 14yearold boy and a 16yearold boy 
innocent of stealing the bicycle but swanson overruled the panel 
he explained to the jurors there was enough proof to support a 
guilty verdict the judge withheld a finding of guilt placed the 
pair on probation and ordered them to pay restitution 
the jury contended that the prosecutor a real one never tied 
the boys to the theft and that others were involved but avoided 
getting hauled into court 
if they got off with it the others should have too said 
juror sarah chancery a senior 
in the other case the jury found two boys guilty of auto theft 
but innocent of a burglary charge this time the judge agreed 
i thought you were very astute swanson told the jury 
the boys whose ages were not available will be punished later 
this month by the judge 
teacher cynthia brendle said the experiment is a lively way for 
students to learn about the law and also should serve as a deterrent 
to youngsters who face criminal charges

the huge store of information in the library of 
congress could be made available to libraries and scholars across 
the country through an improved computer network the nations chief 
librarian said friday 
the library of congress and the national library community want 
to help develop a national research and education network james 
h billington the librarian of congress told a senate subcommittee 
the major information resources for this nation reside in the 
library of congress and other research libraries across the country 
these collections have been assembled in many cases with federal 
state and local revenues 
our citizens have a right to expect that these irreplaceable 
intellectual resources be made ever more widely available through a 
national information network he said 
billington testified in favor of a bill sponsored by sen al 
gore dtenn which calls for the establishment of national 
computerbased research network gore chairs the senate commerce 
science subcommittee which held fridays hearing 
books would be stored digitally on magnetic tape compact discs 
or on computers gore said using a computer library patrons 
could access information from the books in the librarys collection 
thousands of books could be online available at the touch of 
a button gore said adding that the technology already exists 
the library of congress with 88 million items is the largest 
collection of recorded and printed information ever assembled in a 
single place billington said 
one of the questions that needs to be resolved before the 
nationwide network is built is how to ensure copyright protection 
the association of american publishers told the panel

the judge in the trial of dl danny 
faulkner and six others declared a mistrial friday after jurors said 
they were hopelessly deadlocked in the largest savings and loan 
fraud case 
after deliberating for more than 16 days on the 88count 
indictment jurors told us district judge sam cummings they could 
not come to an agreement 
i know were disappointed a verdict has not been reached in 
this case cummings told jurors but im not disappointed in 
your performance 
he told jurors that a gag order remained in effect it was not 
immediately clear how the jury was split 
assistant us attorney terry hart said the case would be retried 
faulkner showed no emotion as the mistrial was announced but 10 
minutes later he fought back tears as he talked to reporters in the 
courthouse lobby 
i think its been really hard on us faulkner said i want 
to be remembered for the nice things ive done not this 
codefendant and former garland mayor james l toler put his arm 
around his wife as he walked out of the courtroom and said lets 
go to the showers get ready to fight again 
faulkner and toler are accused of heading a conspiracy to steal 
135 million from empire savings and loan association of mesquite 
and four other sampls in texas and arkansas in 1982 and 1983 
the other defendants former empire chairman spencer h blain 
jr former sampl employee paul arlin jensen former realestate 
salesman kenneth cansler and land appraisers arthur formann and paul 
douglas tannehill also were accused of conspiracy 
there was little reaction from the defendants or the prosecutors 
when the judge announced the mistrial defendants and their 
attorneys shook hands and hart and two other prosecutors left the 
courtroom immediately 
several jurors were frowning as they entered the courtroom for 
cummings announcement the cordial atmosphere that was evident 
during the six months of testimony had dissolved 
hart asked cummings to poll the jurors but the request was 
denied 
mike fawer towlers attorney called the mistrial an 
absolutely crushing defeat for the government 
the government took its best shot and they have not been able 
to win a case under the best possible circumstances fawer said 
and i think they should leave these people in peace and let them 
get on with their lives 
the indictment charged the seven with defrauding the savings and 
loans through fanciful realestate appraisals and sham land 
transactions along interstate 30 in garland east of dallas 
prosecutors said the defendants gave themselves private jets 
expensive watches and even a 4 million mansion with the money they 
borrowed ostensibly to buy land and condominiums 
all the defendants except formann and tannehill were charged with 
a count of racketeering which allows the government to confiscate 
illegal profits the government had accused the defendants of 
receiving 135 million from the alleged scheme 
after hearing six months of testimony in which 120 witnesses 
testified and more than 3000 documents were introduced the jury 
began deliberations aug 23 
the defense called no witnesses but attorneys contended in two 
days of final arguments the defendants were victims both of texas 
economic collapse in the mid1980s and of the governments key 
witness realestate salesman clifford sinclair 
the defendants contend that sinclair who pleaded guilty to 
federal fraud charges is entirely responsible for planning the 
looting of the savings and loans and he is falsely implicating them 
to get his 13year sentence reduced 
when empire was closed by regulators in 1984 it was the largest 
collapse of a thrift in us history prosecutors said the 
defendants were partly to blame the 279 million empire collapse 
heralded the failures of other thrifts soon after when oil and 
realestate prices plummeted 
unlike some of the smaller trials involving thrifts there were 
no charges of using depositors money to buy influence or sex 
instead testimony consisted of a mindnumbing array of numbers 
recounted by witnesses describing dozens of realestate transactions 
in excruciating detail

it was only a bird call at evening unidentified 
as i came from the spring with water across the rocky 
backpasture 
but i stood so still sky above was not stiller than sky in

years pass all places and faces fade some people have died 
and i stand in a far land the evening still and am at last sure 
that i miss more that stillness at birdcall than some things 
that were 
to fail later

business inventories climbed 06 percent in 
july the biggest gain in three months while total business sales 
fell by 09 percent the government reported friday 
while the combination of falling sales and rising inventories 
would normally spark recession fears analysts for the most part 
dismissed fridays report 
the rise in business inventories is potentially a problem but 
when it is taken in context with other data it is not very 
worrisome said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
supporting this view the federal reserve reported friday that 
industrial production posted a 03 percent increase in august the 
best showing in four months reflecting a rebound in production at 
auto plants 
economists said this increase in industrial output along with a 
rise in retail sales in august was an encouraging sign that 
factories would not be scaling back production plans for fear that 
output was getting ahead of demand 
many analysts believe that outside of the auto industry 
inventories have been kept at fairly lean levels and they are 
predicting that overall production will post moderate gains for the 
rest of the year 
for july the 06 percent rise in inventories the largest since 
a 09 percent may increase pushed the total stockpile of unsold 
goods to a seasonally adjusted 7855 billion 
it was led by a 11 percent rise in inventories held by 
manufacturers inventories at the retail level rose 03 percent 
while wholesale inventories were unchanged 
the 09 percent plunge in total sales matched a similar decline 
in february and was the largest sales setback since a 3 percent drop 
in january 1987 the july decrease left total sales at a seasonally 
adjusted level of 51109 billion 
sales at the manufacturing level fell by 18 percent while sales 
by wholesalers were off 08 percent 
retail sales were the only area of strength rising by 05 
percent in july in an indication of further improvement the 
government said thursday that retail sales in august were up 07 
percent reflecting a surge in auto sales 
the combination of falling sales and rising inventories pushed 
the ratio of inventories to sales to 154 in july meaning that it 
would take 154 months to exhaust inventories at the july sales pace

president carlos salinas de gortari says 
he will help a us coalition of hispanic leaders form a binational 
commission to address problems facing residents on both sides of the 
border 
intent on solidifying ties with mexico the organization impacto 
2000 met with salinas for 45 minutes thursday night to outline their 
plan it was salinas first trip to baja california since he took 
office dec 1 
the proposal would create cooperatives to deal with crossborder 
issues including commerce education immigration culture and 
health care 
saying positive changes already are occurring in several of those 
areas in mexico the president told 300 delegates of the group that 
he welcomed the plan and would direct various mexican agencies to 
begin preparing the framework to deal with some of the issues 
we will continue to work we have a good relationship with the 
us government and the congress and an especially harmonious 
relationship with the mexicanamerican community salinas said 
we will continue that relationship with the future generations of 
mexicanamericans 
the coalition which wants to spur progress on these problems by 
the year 2000 includes representatives from churches immigration 
centers hispanic elected officials and hispanic professional and 
student groups such as the league of united latin american citizens 
and the gi forum 
the proposal submitted to salinas seeks to create a binational 
commission that would include mexican agencies and leaders from 
those business education church student and labor sectors it 
excludes the us government 
armando navarro director of the san bernardino califbased 
institute for social justice said the us government was left out 
because it has underestimated americas relationship with mexico for 
too long 
however impacto realizes that the growing hispanic population in 
the united states is an issue that has to be addressed navarro said 
about 20 million hispanics live in the united states today 62 
percent of them born there navarro said he said projections 
indicate half of californias residents by 2030 will be hispanic 
members of the 4yearold coalition met with salinas last year 
and the president promised to listen to their proposal after he was 
elected

richard herzfelder now the aps news editor for 
mexico and central america has known robert penn warren since 1972 
when he studied under him at yale university 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the cancer that would kill him was already at 
work he couldnt lift weights or walk young men and women into 
breathlessness any more 
but robert penn warren refused to be a sick man he didnt want 
to talk about that he was the first poet laureate of the united 
states and he had a speech to write 
i drove him and his wife eleanor from his summer home in 
stratton vt to a hospital in boston even about that there was a 
sense of adventure would we get lost stuck in a snowbank there 
could be no such thing as disaster 
he told me his daughter rosanna had been born at home during a 
snowstorm no doctors could get to the house that was an adventure 
too but perhaps only in retrospect 
we discussed poetry the news war and rock music you couldnt 
be depressed around him it seemed silly 
mr warren i never called him anything else though his 
nickname was red for the red hair of his youth was generous 
enough to let me think of him as a friend 
i took the last class he taught at yale a writing course given 
in the fall of 1972 he was 67 then the author of all the kings 
men what more could he do i thought that was a book from the 
1940s 
at first it was awful he was an oldfashioned teacher he didnt 
like fools and didnt seem to believe in giveandtake in the 
classroom sometimes he looked like a crocodile 
then he read rudyard kiplings story the man who would be 
king to the class it was amazing that his highpitched kentucky 
accent he never lost it despite years in california england new 
england could recreate the dry mountains of northern pakistan 
he invited the class to his house for dinner introduced us to 
leading literary lights this is john cheever john hersey ralph 
ellison 
i was drinking bourbon because i didnt want to seem like a wimp 
nervous i emptied my glass quickly you look like you need a 
drink he said refilling my glass 
after about six of those i went downstairs and took a nap on the 
dining room floor thats where i was when the first guests walked 
in for supper 
he liked that he came from a generation that thought it romantic 
to drink to oblivion daily though he cut down in later years i 
stayed up with him a couple of times what i couldnt do was get up 
the next morning lift weights and take a twomile walk then it was 
time to work 
work people who telephoned him in the morning got an awful 
shock hed answer but you were interrupting work he didnt much 
like telephones anyway he once wrote a poem called little black 
heart of the telephone 
at the time i didnt understand why that might be important i 
didnt understand how easy it was to lose time how hard it is to 
concentrate and get more than three things done in a day how hard 
it was for a man to keep producing after winning two pulitzer prizes 
he retired from yale then he won his third pulitzer he 
didnt particularly need it what he needed was the work 
mr warren taught me a lot of things few of them in class he 
taught by example by his energy by his love of truth and beauty 
by his sense of adventure 
he and his wife taught me and many others that its possible for 
two competitive people to love each other and have a happy marriage 
mrs warren writes under the name eleanor clark their tennis court 
is a memorial to the national book award it was built with her 
prize money none of those prizes stopped them from wearing funny 
hats on new years eve 
there is a final memory my favorite he told me later hed 
thought i was his stupidest student because i never talked in class 
finally he called me in for a private conference 
somehow i mentioned that i had just read alfred tennysons poem 
ulysses for the first time the last line has become a cliche 
but i thought it was stunning when read as the climax to a great 
poem 
he almost leaped out of his chair and yelped its a 
magnificent poem 
i started reciting the first lines planning to make some learned 
comment or rather some comment that would make me seem learned 
instead he simply joined me together we recited the whole poem 
i could not believe i was remembering it all but it seemed easy 
the poem describes ulysses years after the trojan wars and his 
10year homeward odyssey old but still determined to push on to new 
adventure in spite of all risk trouble or weakness 
i didnt realize how much that might have meant to mr warren 
until just now this is how it ends

the state department registered on friday its 
continuing concern that north korea may be developing nuclear 
weapons but said it was unaware of any development that would 
heighten the concern 
earlier the south korean news agency yonhap quoted a department 
official as saying the us government was gravely concerned and 
was keeping a close watch on possible efforts to develop nuclear 
weapons 
the news agency quoted spencer richardson the head of the 
departments korea section as saying the soviet union would be as 
concerned if north korea produced such weapons 
while denying it has nuclear weapons north korea has repeatedly 
charged that us forces based in south korea were equipped with 
nuclear arms and were preparing for a nuclear war on the divided 
korean peninsula us officials have rejected the north korean 
claims 
the united states garrisons about 43000 troops in south korea 
under a defense pact the soviet union is the communist norths main 
arms supplier 
asked about the yonhap report richard boucher the state 
department spokesman said i dont have anything new to express 
our concern 
he added i think weve talked very often in our past about the 
need for north korea to put its nuclear programs under international 
safeguards they reached some sort of agreement way back in 1985 
with the international atomic energy agency that they would do that 
but so far the actual safeguards provisions have not been completed 
and we really think they should do that at a very early date 
asked if there was some new reason for special concern the us 
official replied he did not have any new information about the 
program or something that would lead me to think that our concerns 
are heightened but we do have a longstanding concern

an allout war against screwworms has been 
launched in puerto rico to help prevent the livestock pests from 
migrating to the united states the agriculture department said 
friday 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said about 20 screwworm larvae were 
found sept 5 near san juan on a horse that had been shipped from 
venezuela 
beginning friday he said about 800000 sexually sterilized 
screwworm flies will be released twice a week for six weeks in a 
fivemile radius around the airport and the quarantine station 
the technique floods the suspected area with sterile male flies 
if a female mates with one her eggs will not hatch thus ending the 
life cycle normally the eggs are laid in open sores or wounds of 
warmblooded animals hatching out into worms that feed on the 
living flesh 
glosser said the adult screwworm fly is about twice the size of a 
house fly with orange eyes and a bluishgreen body with three dark 
stripes along the back screwworm larvae are creamy white and grow 
to about half an inch in length after five to seven days of feeding 
screwworms were eradicated in puerto rico in 1975 the united 
states was declared free of the pests in 1966 although small 
infestations have occurred since then mostly along the usmexico 
border

soviet azerbaijans parliament met in emergency 
session early saturday to discuss the ethnic conflict engulfing the 
armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh official reports said 
the tass news agency said the southern republics supreme soviet 
would also examine a draft law proclaiming azerbaijans sovereignty 
and citizenship and transition to the principles of economic 
independence and selfmanagement 
the measures under study in the mostly moslem republic are in 
line with demands increasingly voiced by many soviet ethnic groups 
for greater control over their own affairs 
the meeting convened friday but the lawmakers had debated for 
more than 14 hours as the session extended into early saturday 
communist party officials will meet tuesday in moscow to consider 
proposed changes in the countrys nationalities policy and try to 
find a way to calm ethnic quarrels that have often erupted in 
violence 
in another sign of the greater democratization under president 
mikhail s gorbachev it was the first time representatives of the 
peoples front of azerbaijan and other informal organizations were 
allowed to attend the republics parliament tass said 
it was meeting in the azerbaijani capital of baku on the caspian 
sea coast 
nagornokarabakh a mountainous territory within azerbaijan with 
a predominantly armenian population is the center of a dispute 
between armenia and azerbaijan about 100 people have died in ethnic 
strife the past 18 months and hundreds of thousands have fled their 
homes 
the peoples front is demanding azerbaijans parliament reassert 
control over nagornokarabakh and that the direct rule over the 
region by moscow instituted in february be halted 
the situation in and around nagornokarabakh has never been so 
tense and explosive as today arkady volsky head of the special 
committee created by the kremlin to administer the district said in 
televised remarks thursday night 
volsky said moscow was forced to assume control of the region 
because of the bloodshed the state cannot stand aside if blood is 
spilled he said 
the duty editor who answered the telephone at azerinform the 
republics official news agency said the session was continuing 
early saturday theyre still debating and havent taken any 
votes said the editor who declined to give his name 
on thursday the newspaper pravda reported that a strike by 
azerbaijani railroad workers to press demands for azerbaijani 
control of nagornokarabakh has resulted in the cutting of fuel and 
other supplies into neighboring armenia 
the strike was called off monday but it resulted in severe 
shortages of fuel and other supplies armenia gets 87 percent of its 
freight from azerbaijan 
the communist party newspaper said the situation was particularly 
threatening in northern armenia where workers are trying to 
reconstruct cities devastated by the earthquake dec 7 that killed 
25000 people

the chairman of the senate select committee on 
indian affairs said friday he wants the seminole indians of oklahoma 
and florida to settle a 50 million dispute themselves instead of 
asking congress to handle it 
in most cases decisions made in washington for indians are the 
worst solutions said sen daniel inouye dhawaii decisions 
should be made in indian country 
his comments came during a hearing on legislation that would 
divide money awarded the tribe in 1976 for florida lands taken when 
most of the tribe was relocated by the government to oklahoma in the 
1823 trail of tears 
the award 16 million has been held by the treasury 
department for 23 years because the members of the tribe many of 
whom still live in florida have not agreed on how it should be 
divided 
it has accumulated substantial interest and it is estimated to 
reach 50 million by the end of this year 
legislation sponsored by oklahoma sens david boren a democrat 
and don nickles republican would give 75 percent of the money to 
the oklahoma seminoles and 25 percent to the florida seminoles the 
miccosukee tribe of florida and the unaffiliated seminole indians of 
florida 
nickles said the split is fair because its based on population 
figures that counted 2146 seminoles in oklahoma and 700 in florida 
he also said the oklahoma tribe is poorer than the florida one 
not only did hundreds of seminoles die during the forced march 
from florida to indian territory but lands initially given to the 
tribe as a reservation were later taken from them as oklahoma became 
a state said nickles 
today the seminole nation in oklahoma has a total of only 380 
acres of tribally owned land he said 
on the other hand he said the florida tribe is flourishing 
economically with a reservation land base of approximately 80000 
acres 
james billie tribal council chairman for the seminoles in 
florida who want a 5050 split told the committee he thought the 
two sides could come to some agreement if they had 30 more days 
while we in florida have a sharp disagreement with our oklahoma 
brethren over the division of the claims commissions award we have 
not lost sight of the fact that we are all one people billie said 
as a result of recent informal preliminary discussions we have 
had with some of our oklahoma brethren we believe that it still may 
be possible in a relatively short time to have agreement reached 
by the two groups 
i would prefer negotiations said inouye he said sovereign 
nations as indian tribes are viewed should be able to negotiate

gov george deukmejian predicted lives 
will be saved by legislation he signed friday to lower californias 
bloodalcohol standard for drunken drivers 
we are seeing a reduction in the number of traffic fatalities 
caused by drunken drivers he told reporters and law enforcement 
officers gathered in his office for the bill signing 
on the other hand we still have a far greater number of such 
fatalities than we should have in california this will make it 
possible for law enforcement to obtain greater numbers of 
convictions the republican governor said 
deukmejian said 2239 people died last year as a result of 
drunken drivers on california highways 
the law effective jan 1 lowers the bloodalcohol level at 
which a person is presumed too drunk to drive from 010 percent to 
008 percent current law allows for prosecution when a drivers 
bloodalcohol level is below 010 percent if there is other evidence 
the driver was too intoxicated to drive safely convictions are 
rare however 
the new law still allows for prosecutions at levels below 008 
percent if other evidence warrants it the american medical 
association supports a 005 percent level 
a variety of factors including weight affect the amount of 
alcohol a person can consume before getting drunk the average 
person can consume about three glasses of beer or comparable amounts 
of other alcoholic beverages in an hour before reaching the 008 
percent level 
drunken drivers should beware of the lowered standard deukmejian 
said 
this is a very strong signal and message to individuals who do 
drink and do drive that it is more likely that they will wind up 
being convicted of drunken driving he said

a senior state department official called on 
the arab governments friday night to abandon their campaign of 
trying to expel israel from the united nations 
john h kelly the assistant secretary of state for the near 
east said that change in tactics could contribute to efforts to 
arrange negotiations between the arabs and israel 
every year around this time the question comes up for a vote 
kelly said in a speech prepared for a conference on the middle east 
at the wye plantation in maryland 
it is time for the arab nations to follow the example of the 
plo and acknowledge israels existence as a state israel is 
entitled to membership in the united nations under the principle of 
universality kelly said 
the us official referred to the step taken last year by 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat who also 
publicly renounced terrorism that action met us conditions for 
the dialogue opened by the united states with the plo last december 
it is time for the arab governments to stop the anachronistic 
practice of voting against israeli credentials kelly said 
the arabs have consistently failed to oust israel from the united 
nations but the move provides an annual opportunity to condemn the 
jewish state before a large audience arab delegates also habitually 
walk out when israels representative speaks to the un general 
assembly 
kelly denied us peace efforts were at a dead end 
there is potential for movement he said adding that a 
timetable for facetoface negotiations should be set by 
palestinians and israel not the bush administration

a house panel charged friday that faa officials 
lied under oath about payroll records prepared during the 1981 
controllers strike and in some instances doctored time sheets to 
cheat the controllers 
the committee asked the justice department to investigate 
faced with shoddy documents to justify the firings before the 
merit systems protection board federal aviation administration 
officials in chicago for three months created attendance records to 
bolster their cases lawmakers concluded 
the report by the public works and transportation subcommittee on 
investigations and oversight capped a threeyear probe that included 
private hearings and documents subpoenaed from the chicago air route 
traffic control center at aurora ill 
the panel said it was willing to send its evidence to the justice 
department and sent a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
urging an investigation into possible criminal misconduct 
john leyden a spokesman for the faa in washington declined 
comment except to say the faa has receieved the report and will 
review it 
the subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the 450 
firings in chicago which were among 11500 nationwide ordered aug 
5 1981 by thenpresident reagan two days after members of the 
professional air traffic controllers organization struck 
rather the subcommittee said it was concerned with the actions 
of faa officials while they were defending the firings in front of 
the board that considers appeals from dismissed federal employees 
for example the faa officials corrected some attendance records 
to bring them up to date but altered others in some instances 
recording a controller who was on leave at the time of the strike as 
being absent without leave to cheat the controllers the 
subcommittee said 
the panels report said the strike produced traumatic and 
confusing times at the chicago center supervisors had to handle 
other jobs and this situation severely affected the condition of 
the centers attendance records the report said 
on aug 13 1981 10 days after the strike began and a month 
before the controllers were told formally they had been fired 
robert l miller evaluations officer at the center began to 
process personnel files in anticipation that appeals would be filed 
with the appeals board the subcommittee said 
to justify the firings faa officials decided to present 
attendance records showing that the controllers had failed to report 
to work during the strike 
between sept 14 and oct 1 these records were sent to the faas 
great lakes regional office in des plaines ill but officials 
there found so many clerical errors that employees in aurora had to 
produce a second set of attendance records the subcommittee said 
faa officials subsequently assured the merit board that the 
records were the ones that had been used by george gunter the chief 
of the chicago center and the official who ordered the firings 
the subcommittee concluded however that the assurance was a 
certification that we now know to be false 
these documents in many cases either did not exist at the 
time of the controller dismissals or were riddled with errors the 
subcommittee said a plan was instituted whereby records were 
created where none existed and amended where there were errors 
the subcommittee said it was not able to determine who had 
ordered the second set of records 
the subcommittees report also concluded that richard shewfelt 
the faas regional manager for labor relations at the time knew 
of the problems of consistency and accuracy in the records that led 
to the second shipment 
shewfelt who still works for the faas chicago office did not 
return phone messages requesting comment miller is retired and 
could not be found for comment 
gunter now supervisor of training at the air route traffic 
control center in fremont calif said he had not seen the report 
and declined to comment

the first major american exhibition of 
contemporary east german art is most surprising for what it does not 
include no grand pictures of tractors and happy peasants 
according to a harvard curator 
instead the dozen artists whose work was chosen to represent the 
german democratic republic dispel stereotypes of flat socialist art 
with often harrowing portraits of the horrors of war and political 
oppression 
the nearly 70 paintings and drawings by artists ages 35 to the 
mid80s were selected by harvard curator peter nisbet art critic 
dore ashton of the cooper union in new york and modern german art 
historian and professor peter selz 
we hope the whole show undermines expectations said nisbet 
who accompanied the others on travels to east germany to meet 
artists and their work this is an example of how many of these 
artists do not show false optimism or a sense that there is an easy 
road to an ideal state they are aware of the fraigility of peace 
of nightmares of anxiety 
the artists whose paintings are shown are not among the legions 
of refugees departing the country across the hungarian border to 
austria he said 
these are people who have decided to stay and fight and 
introduce into east germanys official culture as much of human life 
as they can said nisbet who led a tour of the exhibit friday 
which opens sept 16 and runs through nov 5 one has to 
acknowledge the honorable role they play the people who are leaving 
decided to give up the struggle 
the paintings range from max uhligs expressionist almost 
abstract portraits and landscapes to theodor rosenhauers still 
lifes and other more lighthearted and ironic works 
the exhibit half of which is in the fogg museum at harvard 
university and the other half at the sackler museum across the 
street opens with a twist 
the first work on view is a fourpanel painting that depicts four 
soviet soldiers against a vivid red background 
its the perfect introductory painting said nisbet it 
looks propagandalike 
but on closer inspection the soldiers in thomas zieglers 
soviet soldier 1987 are clearly from different ethnic groups 
one art critic said nisbet suggested the paintings are a 
meditation on individual versus the group and hint at the 
transience of military occupation and the hope for eventual peace 
the paintings and drawings that follow soviet soldier smash 
stereotypes of socialist realism painting 
bernhard heisigs haunting volunteer soldier is among the 
most powerful in the exhibit it depicts the horrified face of a 
soldier surrounded by a dark swirling montage of images that 
nisbet termed a collage of horrible memories 
many of the artists works invoke feelings of helplessness and 
anxiety nisbet suggested that the artists have struggled with the 
stunted political and cultural history of east germany while they 
draw on the rich history of german art they cannot escape the 
constraints and sense of collective identity confusion in an eastern 
bloc country 
walter libudas ceiling runner is kafkaesque in its portrayal 
of a man hanging upside down with his feet on the ceiling 
but not all the paintings are as dark 
one of sighard gilles works party in leipzig shows a group 
of artists engaged in a bit of decadence at a cafe the painting was 
considered controversial in east germany but was eventually allowed 
to be shown there and abroad said selz who teaches at the 
university of california at berkeley 
it shows theres much more freedom of artistic expression he 
said

about 10000 people marched 
through this capital city friday in support of talks intended to end 
a decadeold civil war president alfredo cristiani promised 
flexibility in the peace effort 
the march coincided with central americas independence day and 
participants chanted slogans calling for true independence 
without yankee intervention 
many of the leftleaning groups that participated consider el 
salvador dependent on the united states and subordinate to it 
washington has provided more than 35 billion in military and 
economic aid to el salvador this decade making this couuntry latin 
americas biggest single recipient of american assistance 
the aid has been aimed at preventing a victory by the leftist 
farabundo marti national liberation front popularly known by its 
spanish initials fmln 
el salvador guatemala nicaragua costa rica and honduras on 
friday celebrated together the 168th anniversary of independence 
from spain in 1821 
government and rebel representatives agreed on friday to open 
peace talks next month after two days of discussions in mexico city 
the first such discussions in two years 
cristiani called the mexico city agreements important accords 
on how to proceed toward ending a war that has claimed more than 
70000 lives but he warned while welcoming the dialogue process 
we dont want to create false expectations we want to reiterate 
that our attitude is one of openness and flexibility within our 
constitutional framework we know the road ahead is difficult and 
complex 
he addressed a small rally of supporters and government officials 
in a downtown park 
for the first time since the war started in 1979 authorities 
staged an independence day military parade though the capital about 
3000 troops from the three military branches and the three 
militarized police forces marched to music by military bands 
crowds lined the parade route which followed a route different 
from that of the peace march but the peace marchers appeared to 
attract more people who waved white flags and blueandwhite 
national banners and chanted slogans hailing the upcoming dialogue 
the march was sponsored by the national debate for peace an 
umbrella organization comprising about 70 church union student and 
humanitarian organizations

officials in israels two largest parties said 
friday that disagreements over egypts plan to arrange 
israelipalestinian talks threatened the coalition government 
israels top leaders on friday reportedly clashed for the second 
time this week over the 10point plan and on president hosni 
mubaraks efforts to sponsor a palestinian delegation for talks with 
israel 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir emerged optimistic after 
fridays session telling israel radio 
there are some chances for moving our peace process not only 
by these 10 points there are other developments that encourage 
us i dont think we are facing a deadlock there is a movement and 
we are discussing further developments with our american friends 
egyptian friends and i hope that we will get results 
egyptian ambassador mohammed bassiouny presented the plan to the 
israeli officials said an aide to labor party leader shimon peres 
israel had been saying it cannot comment on a proposal it has not 
been officially presented with 
in the occupied west bank troops shot and killed two palestinian 
youths in clashes with stonethrowers in nablus arab hospital 
officials said the army confirmed both deaths but said soldiers did 
not open fire where 12yearold tarkek said tuffah was killed arab 
reports said tuffah was shot by an army sniper 
the two deaths raise to 570 the palestinian death toll in the 
21monthold uprising against israeli occupation forty israelis 
have also died in the violence and 114 arabs have been killed by 
fellow palestinians who accused them of collaborating with israeli 
authorities 
a meeting of labors peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin 
with likuds shamir and foreign minister moshe arens ended in sharp 
disagreement israel radio reported 
egypts plan stipulates acceptance of the ussupported formula 
of trading territory for peace and participation of the 140000 
residents of annexed east jerusalem in the palestinian elections 
offered by israel 
both ideas are opposed by likud but supported by labor 
mubarak also proposed that the 12member palestinian delegation 
include two arabs deported from the occupied territories 
the proposal is intended to satisfy israels demand to talk only 
to palestinians from the territories and the plos insistence that 
palestinians living abroad be included in any talks 
deportees are not exactly outside palestinians i would not 
be quick to reject this possibility peres said in an interview 
with the englishlanguage jerusalem post 
a labor official speaking on condition of anonymity said labor 
ministers agreed in a meeting thursday night to negotiate with such 
a delegation he said the party saw no need to stay in the 
government if there was no progress in peace talks 
labor apparently agrees to negotiate with deportees as a way of 
bypassing direct negotiations with the palestine liberation 
organization but likud officials see no difference 
israel officially refuses to negotiate with the plo calling it a 
terrorist organization bent on israels destruction 
transport minister moshe katzav of the rightwing likud told 
the daily yediot ahronot that anyone seeking to accept the 10 
points wants to break up the national unity government which was 
formed in lengthy negotiations following november 1988 elections 
shamir wants to resolve the deadlock prior to arens and peres 
visits to the united states next week peres is scheduled to meet 
with president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii during 
his 10day stay and arens plans to see baker

larry brauer is severely retarded and a captive of 
physical problems that require 24hour attention his parents cant 
care for him and now the state says it has no money to look after 
him once he turns 22 next month 
so larry brauer was set to go to court on monday in a bid to save 
his life 
his life is in jeopardy theres no question about it because 
state officials havent fulfilled what they have committed 
themselves to larrys father dr mark brauer said friday 
i dont know why this is happening to my son who has done 
nothing to anybody whose life is hard to imagine said brauer a 
hematologist at boston city hospital im not asking for charity 
im a pretty resourceful guy im usually able to solve my own 
problems but ive really hit the wall here 
mark and helle brauer a physical therapist have joined nine 
other couples in suing gov michael dukakis for impounding the money 
that would continue care for their retarded and disabled sons and 
daughters 
the young people receive care at the private crystal springs 
school in assonet at an annual cost of about 80000 a person but 
funding for such care ends when they all turn 22 this year 
the lawsuit contends that by impounding the money already 
approved by legislators dukakis violated the constitutional 
separation of powers and that retarded citizens such as larry 
brauer have a constitutional right to treatment and safety 
every year about 450 mentally retarded massachusetts residents 
turn 22 the age at which they leave the protection and training of 
the state education system the most severely retarded and disabled 
about 70 this year usually get placed in a home in a residential 
community with 24hour supervision and medical care 
but this year there is no money to pay for such care 
the deep budget cuts dukakis made in july eliminated 33 million 
needed to give those 70 people the care they need to survive said 
maureen sullivan spokeswoman for the state department of mental 
retardation 
going home to their families is going to be a real disaster 
ms sullivan said its a lousy situation 
the state is trying to help ms sullivan said parents are being 
advised about support services some could go to state schools for 
the retarded reversing a move to empty institutions once decried as 
warehouses pediatric nursing homes that might consider taking 
adults are also being contacted she said 
the choice we have to make is for someone who is literally 
homeless she said 
larry brauer has been at crystal springs since he was 11 he 
functions at the level of a 16month old is paralyzed on the left 
side and suffers from grand mal seizures so intense that they can 
stop his breathing and require him to wear a helmet to avoid injury 
he needs help going to the bathroom dressing and eating if his 
parents took him home one would have to quit work and they could 
expect to spend some nights just listening to make sure he was still 
breathing 
historically even going back to the 19th century this state 
has always provided for these types of clients said roderick 
macleish the attorney for the brauers and the other parents 
the parents cant safely handle these kids and the schools 
cant continue to care for these kids free of charge we face the 
very real prospect of people who are seriously mentally retarded 
living in shelters for the homeless the state has never abandoned 
people like this macleish said 
the matter is far from over 
since the lawsuit was filed some families have been told their 
children could receive state benefits until new federally funded 
cottages are built to accommodate them at crystal springs mark 
brauer said

irish and british officials agreed at a 
7hour meeting friday that integrity was critically important 
among northern ireland security forces tainted by charges of murder 
and collusion with terrorists 
foreign minister gerry collins in his first meeting with 
britains new northern ireland secretary peter brooke stressed 
irelands unhappiness with reports that confidential police 
documents fell into the hands of protestant gunmen 
the officials met specifically to discuss questions about the 
reliability of the security forces the first time since the 
signing of the angloirish accord in 1985 that security was the only 
topic on the agenda 
the pact gave the irish republic a say in the affairs of the 
protestantdominated british province and set up a structure for 
such meetings as fridays 
brooke said later the irish put to us their concerns and it 
was decided all the points raised should be looked at again in any 
discussions there are bound to be differences but i think we 
made considerable progress 
collins called it a serious meeting 
the important thing is to establish confidence in the security 
forces as a whole among the nationalist community in northern 
ireland he said 
the two sides agreed to meet again shortly a joint statement 
said 
it said both sides emphasized their belief that confidence in 
the evenhandedness and integrity of the security forces was 
critically important 
also on the agenda were the role of the british armys locally 
recruited ulster defense regiment and the use of plastic bullets 
irish authorities have said that intelligence developed by the 
garda siochana irelands police force may not be safe in the hands 
of the security forces in northern ireland 
the royal ulster constabulary the police force in northern 
ireland disclosed thursday that a list and photographs of 12 
suspected members of the irish republican army were stolen from a 
belfast police station 
confidential information earlier disappeared from the ballykinlar 
army base in county down 
an english detective was assigned to investigate the two cases 
on monday two members of the ulster defense regiment were 
charged with the murder of a roman catholic man 
men who had identified themselves as members of the outlawed 
ulster freedom fighters had shown a tv reporter documents 
apparently stolen or leaked from security forces which identified 
the murder victim as a suspected ira member

many us police forces have resorted to 
painful holds and sometimes brutality when arresting nonviolent 
demonstrators the us commission on civil rights was told friday 
most of the complaints related to police actions at operation 
rescue demonstrations by prolife activists at abortion clinics 
but others suggested a resurgence in some cities of police brutality 
against blacks 
the commission staff cited recurring cases of alleged police 
misconduct in recent demonstrations in 17 cities including atlanta 
boston denver los angeles new york city and pittsburgh 
virtually none of the complaints asserted wrongful arrest 
rather they revolved around whether police had used unnecessary 
force in removing nonviolent protesters some of whom invited 
arrest as a symbolic gesture 
the purported victims were not publicly identified 
the paincompliance controversy involves a variety of holds 
that many officers reserve for someone actively resisting arrest 
the holds include locks and twists of elbows wrists or 
fingers the twisting of ears or squeezing of mastoid pressure 
points behind the ears or the insertion of fingers into someones 
nostrils to pull him off the ground 
the commission viewed videotapes showing such techniques being 
used against demonstrators who had gone limp as police tried to move 
them to vans or buses after their arrest 
in the severest case los angeles police used nunchukus an 
oriental martialarts weapon sort of a hinged billy club against 
operation rescue demonstrators one mans arm was broken the snap 
of his bone could be heard on the tape 
a fundamental issue is whether paincompliance techniques 
particularly the use of nunchukus can ever be justified in the 
context of arresting nonresisting passive demonstrators said 
jeffrey p oconnell the commissions assistant general counsel 
robert r mccue chief of the 125officer west hartford conn 
police force insisted some paincompliance methods he called them 
comealong holds are appropriate when handling arrestees who 
decline to move under their own power 
mccue said his officers had used such holds when removing 
operation rescue demonstrators from an abortion clinic april 1 when 
61 people were arrested and june 17 when 261 were charged 
a demonstrator who goes limp is effectively resisting arrest 
mccue said 
we explain to the arrestee that we intend to use a comealong 
hold that will cause pressure and probable pain if there is 
resistance he said if he still refuses a comealong hold is 
used using only as much pressure as required to accomplish the 
task 
mccue also offered no apology in response to complaints that his 
officers had removed their name tags making it difficult for the 
demonstrators to bring a misconduct charge against them 
it is the policy of our department that all officers who will 
be required to physically move arrestees will remove their badges 
name tags and any other items to lessen the possibility of 
these items causing injury to those arrested he said its just 
common sense to remove anything with a sharp edge 
melvin c high assistant chief of the washington metropolitan 
police said his officers are instructed never to use 
paincompliance holds against nonviolent demonstrators and always 
to wear name tags 
the commission headed by william b allen also viewed 
videotapes of helmeted police charging groups of black college 
students in virginia beach va over the labor day weekend after 
some instances of looting by the holiday crowd 
it also heard from don jackson a former police sergeant who 
while engaged in a sting operation against alleged racism within 
the long beach calif police department was filmed by an nbc crew 
as two local officers pushed his head through a plate glass window 
these incidents are frequent said jackson who is black 
the evidence of police misconduct is overwhelming the response to 
it limited 
lawrence sherman a university of maryland criminology professor 
and president of the crime control institute suggested police 
misconduct may be on the rise as a consequence of political 
pressures to hire more officers to handle the wave of drug crimes 
almost all these cases involve young officers under the age of 
25 he said 
the commission which has no authority to discipline departments 
or officers is chartered to review the performance of other federal 
agencies responsible for enforcing civil rights laws and to 
recommend new laws to congress

children clapped the governor was 
showered with cloth garlands and a sheep was slaughtered in the 
middle of the road friday as the military welcomed about 200 
vehicles from a supply convoy that began rolling last month 
the antimarxist rebels welcomed the convoy in their own way two 
rockets slammed down about 250 feet from where the provincial 
governor gen noor alhaq ulumi was talking to reporters as trucks 
and tanks rumbled past 
no injuries were reported 
ulumi said almost 1000 trucks had snaked their way across almost 
780 miles of the barren south before arriving in this southeastern 
provincial capital this week 
in pakistan sources from the mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors the afghan rebels based in pakistan and diplomatic 
sources said the rebels knocked out 80 vehicles and slowed the 
convoys forward progress to a snails pace the sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
ulumi said the convoy lost three trucks in a collision and one 
tank to a land mine he said it had not suffered any mujahedeen 
attacks after leaving grishik 60 miles west of kandahar 
earlier government officials said rebel forces attacked the 
convoy at least three times and rebel rocket attacks forced it to 
halt between grishik and kandahar 
initial government reports also said 1300 vehicles were in the 
convoy 
the rockets friday scattered the welcoming crowd that had been 
throwing cloth flowers threaded onto metal rings 
the throat of the lone sacrificial sheep was cut with a dull 
knife in front of the lead vehicle and tires left gory imprints on 
the road 
the trucks rumbling through the outskirts of kandahar friday were 
the second batch to reach the city ulumi said with more expected 
each day 
he said the convoy was carrying ammunition and food and included 
500 military trucks 300 civilian trucks and a brigade of armored 
vehicles he would not say how many 
there were no civilian trucks and no food in the carefully 
orchestrated welcoming ceremony the military trucks were flanked by 
32 tanks 
most were stacked with ammunition boxes and caked with dirt some 
were empty with spanking clean cabs ulumi said they were unloaded 
earlier at a nearby garrison 
many trucks seemed new government officials have said the soviet 
union recently delivered more than 1000 trucks to afghanistan 
ulumi said the ammunition should last troops in the area a year 
depending on the extent of fighting 
if there is no war the supplies will last 10 years if there 
is a war one year he said 
it is the first such convoy since february when soviet troops 
withdrew from afghanistan nine years after intervening to prop up 
the marxist government the usbacked mujahedeen are still 
fighting the kabul government 
the mujahedeen have not captured a major city despite repeated 
attempts the convoy was seen as a warning to the mujahedeen that 
their acknowledged primacy in rural areas could be weakened 
officials in kabul were always upbeat about the trucks progress 
but repeated claims that the convoy was on the outskirts of kandahar 
were constantly revised 
ulumi would not say when the trucks had pulled out of torghundi 
on the northern border with the soviet union government sources in 
kabul have said the departure date was aug 18 kandahar lies 350 
miles to the northwest of torghundi 
ulumi claimed progress toward kandahar was slow because the 
trucks were used to supply a new set of border posts near pakistan 
speaking through an interpreter he said the posts should make it 
harder for the mujahedeen to use clansdestine routes through the 
registan desert to get into afghanistan 
supplies muust be brought into afghanistan during the summer 
because winter rain and snow make the roads impassable 
guerrillas have tried since october 1987 to capture kandahar and 
heavy fighting has left much of the city in ruins ulumi said two 
weeks ago that 70 percent of the buildings in the city were 
completely destroyed 
kandahar is 70 miles from pakistan and about 270 miles south of 
kabul the afghan capital 
it was afghanistans second largest city with about 300000 
people before the civil war began nearly 11 years ago govertment 
officials said the population fell to about 25000 when bombardment 
was at its heaviest but later talked of 200000 now living in 
kandahar

thousands of dollars in bonuses even while hundreds of workers were 
being laid off from his television ministry before the christmas 
holidays witnesses testified friday 
i called my children together and said im sorry to tell you 
this but we wont have christmas until after because the check 
wont be here joanie ames a former ptl payroll clerk and single 
mother of two testified in bakkers fraud and conspiracy trial 
she was laid off in november 1985 with 285 other ptl employees 
saving the ministry 36 million said chris easley ptls personnel 
director for 1 years 
the prosecution has said that bakker received a 200000 bonus on 
nov 12 1985 and tammy got a 100000 bonus less than a year 
later on nov 3 1986 the ptl board approved a 500000 bonus for 
bakker 
the rev evelyn spencer of oakland calif who joined the board 
of ptl in november 1985 testified that the largest bonus she 
remembered approving was 150000 plus taxes 
but when asked by prosecutor deborah smith if she would have 
approved a 500000 bonus for bakker ms spencer said if 
everybody else agreed with it i would have 
she said she trusted bakker to inform board members of the 
ministrys financial condition i just trusted him period she 
said 
she said she was never informed about the extent of an internal 
revenue service investigation and church secretary jessica hahns 
threat of a civil lawsuit over her sexual encounter with bakker 
she said she learned of the lawsuit threat in march 1987 when 
bakker resigned from the ministry over the scandal 
prosecutors accuse bakker of diverting millions of dollars in ptl 
money to fund his lavish lifestyle if found guilty of the 24 counts 
against him bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and 
fined more than 5 million 
in later testimony friday a los angeles lawyer said ptl 
officials were eager to reach a settlement with ms hahn and wanted 
to keep the matter quiet 
scott furstman who said he was contacted by richard dortch 
ptls executive vice president testified that ms hahns complaint 
sought 12 million 
furstman said he saw many problems with the complaint but rev 
dortch indicated he still had a strong desire to settle dortch was 
very concerned that the matter did not become public 
a deal finally struck between dortch and ms hahn included a 
115000 payment to ms hahn with 150000 in a trust account for 
her the trust was never set up but the money was deposited in a 
money market account 
the trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee in 
ptls bankruptcy proceedings in july 1988 
former ptl board member aimee cortese testified that bakker never 
told the board about the 265000 paid to ms hahn in exchange for 
her silence 
mrs cortese a minister at the crossroads tabernacle church in 
new york city recalled being asked by dortch to assist him in 
paying ms hahn a total of 14000 in 1984 
mrs cortese testified that dortch called her into his office and 
spelled out the details of bakkers sexual liaison she said she 
later handed over 2000 to ms hahn on one occasion and 12000 on 
a later date 
she recalled a comment bakker made to her regarding hahn he 
said she wasnt what she said she was as far as being a virgin 
mrs cortese said recalling bakkers words he said she was a 
woman of the world 
mrs cortese said she never would have voted for the bonuses had 
she known about ptls financial condition it didnt make sense 
she said how could you give away bonuses while you were floating 
checks 
former ptl controller dana caldwell testified that ptl had a poor 
debttoasset ratio during bakkers tenure at one time at 1to3 
ptl was nearly 37 million in debt when bakker resigned in march 
1987 with assets of about 9 million

mayor marion barry insisted to his cabinet on 
friday that he will never be indicted in the federal investigation 
of convicted drug dealer charles lewis according three top district 
of columbia officials 
barry opened and closed the monthly cabinet session by telling 
his aides that they should go ahead with the work of the city 
without worrying about whether his legal difficulties will worsen 
the officials said 
it was a call to arms said one official he lashed out at 
the media said the white power structure is out to get him and he 
vowed not to be beaten down by these forces 
barry has said he will seek a fourth fouryear term next year 
another top city official who attended the hourlong session said 
barry stressed that he would not be indicted in a probe of his ties 
to convicted drug dealer charles lewis 
barry assured us that he was in no legal trouble that this 
would all blow over the second official said he also mentioned 
several biblical passages and said he was counting on god to see 
him through this 
two officials said the meeting was dominated by barrys comments 
on his legal difficulties despite the fact that other issues like 
drugs crime and public education were discussed 
the mayor set the tone a third official said he 
concentrated on this in his opening remarks and then he closed by 
trying to let us know that everything was alright and that we should 
go ahead with our jobs 
all of the officials asked not to be identified 
cabinet meetings are for the benefit of the mayor and his 
aides said maudine cooper barrys chief of staff they are not 
for the public and it is disloyal and inappropriate for anyone to 
talk about those meetings

barry spokeswoman lurma rackley said friday the mayor wants to 
go on record as saying he never said that he never used the words 
black and white in that context rackley said she was at the 
meeting 
rackley said barry had no comment on other events at the meeting

from the virgin islands dixie lee hedrington testified before a 
federal grand jury investigating barrys ties to lewis a former 
city employee who faces drug charges in the nations capital and is 
awaiting sentencing in the virgin islands 
the washington post has reported hedrington told authorities she 
saw cocaine in barrys virgin islands hotel room when the mayor

of the royal canadian mounted police in fredericton said thats

prompted police to move the men facing drug charges from fredericton 
city jail to a more secure prison within the province he would not 
say which prison 
canadian police said they had ruled out suggestions that the 
suspects are hitmen sent by drug traffickers in colombia to kill 
officials from canada or the united states 
theres no threat to any us or canadian government 
official hutchinson said in a brief statement 
canadian authorities also rejected speculation that the suspects 
had intended to cross the border to mount an attack at president 
bushs vacation home in kennebunkport me

vezeris said we are monitoring the situation there but we do not 
beleive it has anything to do with threats to individuals in this

colombian drug traffickers who provide most of the cocaine sold in

the salvadoran government and leftist rebels 
agreed friday to meet monthly to try to negotiate an end to their 
10yearold civil war that has claimed 70000 lives 
crowds marched through the streets of san salvador cheering the 
mexico city agreements and rightwing president alfredo cristiani 
said he was encouraged 
leaders of the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
said their hope was for peace in 1990 
the rebels and the government agreed to meet next in san jose 
the costa rican capital on oct 1617 and at 30day intervals 
thereafter 
they agreed that two representatives from the roman catholic 
church will mediate the talks and that they will also invite the 
united nations and the organization of american states to send 
observers 
the cristiani government initially opposed church mediation or 
outside observers it had also proposed meeting the front known by 
its spanish initials fmln every two months instead of at 30day 
intervals 
the pact reached after two days of intensive talks also 
stipulates that neither side can unilaterally withdraw from the 
negotiations and that each delegation will have authority to reach 
binding accords 
the fmln hopes there will be a christmas and new year in peace 
in our country and that 1990 will be the year of the wars final 
end rebel leader shafick handal said at a joint news conference 
after the accord was signed 
the blood that has been spilled in the longest and most costly 
conflict on the continent all this blood that has been spilled 
deserves this 
cristiani called the agreement important but cautioned 
while welcoming the dialogue process we dont want to create 
false expectations 
we want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and 
flexibility within our constitutional framework we know the road 
ahead is difficult and complex he told an independence day rally 
in the salvadoran capital 
the mexico city accord was announced on central american 
independence day the 168th anniversary of the independence of el 
salvador honduras nicaragua costa rica and guatemala from spain 
in 1821 
we will possibly confront obstacles but we trust in god and in 
the good will of the two sides and we will overcome the 
difficulties cristiani said 
handal and fellow guerrilla commander joaquin villalobos said the 
fmln proposed the talks because of pressure inside and outside their 
country for peace 
they also said they feared the rightist government would become a 
facist dictatorship unless checked by the kind of democracy 
peace could bring 
most of the wars victims have been civilians human rights 
groups and international organizations say many were killed by 
rightwing death squads linked to the military and cristianis party 
links the party denies 
the mexico city talks were the first in two years between 
government and rebels they were also the first meeting between the 
rebels and cristianis administration 
the rebels have already laid out their peace proposal the 
government is to present its proposal in october 
the fmln offered to transform itself from a rebel army into a 
legal political party in exchange for sweeping social and political 
reforms 
the reforms would erode the power of the military and of 
cristianis party which now holds controls the national assembly 
and the supreme court 
the rebels demand that the military be purged of human rights 
violators and reduced in size that the date of the 1991 legislative 
and municipal elections be advanced and that a new high court be 
appointed 
in return the rebels say they will become a legitimate political 
party and run candidates in elections something they have refused 
to do 
they dropped demands for powersharing and for merging the rebel 
and government armies and couched their plan in language far milder 
than any previous proposal 
the proposal asks the united states to end military aid to el 
salvador and channel the money instead into el salvadors economic 
development 
to prevent a rebel victory the united states has given about 
35 billion in military and economic aid to el salvador this decade 
making it latin americas biggest single recipient of american 
assistance

a printing plant worker disabled by mental 
illness was able to legally buy the ak47 assault rifle he used to 
kill seven former coworkers without revealing his mental problems 
authorities said friday 
police said joseph t wesbecker was armed with several 
semiautomatic weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition thursday 
morning as he went from floor to floor at the standard gravure corp 
wesbecker killed seven people and injured 13 before killing 
himself three of the injured were in critical condition friday 
standard gravure employees met with grief counselors when they 
returned to the plant friday morning and several hundred later 
attended a mass at the roman catholic cathedral of the assumption 
president bush on friday lamented the loss of life in the 
rampage but said he still opposes legislation to ban possession of 
such weapons 
bush in march banned the import of foreignmade assault rifles 
into the united states including the chinesemade ak47 howeer 
possession of the weapon is not a federal offense and bush has taken 
no steps toward proposing curbs on us manufacture of such weapons 
wesbecker bought the ak47 on may 1 at tilfords gun sales in 
louisville said police chief richard dotson 
gun shop owner jack tilford said wesbecker answered all eight 
questions properly on a federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms gun purchase form 
he passed all the tests and obligations for purchasing 
firearms tilford said friday 
one of the eight questions asked have you ever been 
adjudicated mentally defective or have you ever been committed to a 
mental institution 
the form shows wesbecker answered no to that question tilford 
noted that gun shop owners have no way to check the validity of 
answers to that question 
lt jeff moody police homicide commander has said that 
wesbecker had spent time voluntarily in mental institutions 
including our lady of peace in louisville police would not reveal 
when he had been hospitalized 
wesbecker 47 was a pressman at the plant from 1971 until the 
company placed him on permanent disability leave last feb 2 because 
of mental illness police said 
relatives told police that wesbecker was a manic depressive who 
had attempted suicide three times

deranged and i dont want to prejudice this poor soul but if he 
was deranged im afraid youre going to have incidents like this

robert penn warren was remembered friday as a son 
of the south who became a citizen of the world as a brilliant poet 
fiction writer teacher and critic and as a nice man 
he was reticent ironic reserved and perfectly charming and i 
loved and respected him quite apart from his work said poet 
howard nemerov who owns a copy of the first edition of warrens 
first book 
he had such vigor and such love of life he was such wonderful 
company he was the soul of hilarity said novelist eudora welty 
whose first work was published in the southern review when warren 
was editor in the 1930s he was a good friend to writers 
constantly generous and giving 
red warren died friday at his summer home in vermont after 
battling cancer for three years in a literary career that spanned 
nearly 60 years he wrote dozens of books and made hundreds of 
friends 
many were colleagues cleanth brooks developed the new 
criticism with warren concentrating on the text of literature 
not the authors lives 
he was one of our truly allaround men who made great 
contributions in all fields he was a great poet fine teacher and 
did something to revolutionize the modes of teaching literature 
said brooks 
others were students pete axthelm the writer and tv commentator 
and a student of warrens at yale in the mid60s recalled sitting 
in his office over morning coffee to discuss comic scenes by 
novelist william faulkner 
i treasure the memory he said when people ask me what the 
best thing about going to yale was i always say robert penn warren 
to listen to this man of the south talk about the great 
southern writer was just an unbelievable privilege i really did 
love this man 
others were officials of institutions with which he was 
affiliated 
james h billington librarian of congress said warrens years 
at the library of congress as consultant in poetry and more recently 
as the nations first poet laureate consultant in poetry were 
marked by extraordinary excellence of achievement his legacy 
promises to be with americans for generations to come 
warren was a wonderfully warm and generous man who is fondly 
remembered by his former students and colleagues said joe b 
wyatt chancellor of vanderbilt university which warren attended as 
an undergraduate and where he joined two important literary 
movements the fugitives and the agrarians 
the fugitives named after a literary magazine argued the 
importance of a southern literary identity the agrarians warned 
against the dangers of industrialization and it was in that 
connection that warren wrote an essay defending segregation he came 
to repudiate that stance 
this was in 1930 he just felt that was then this was now 
said walter sullivan a professor of english at vanderbilt who had 
known warren since the late 1940s 
i think he is going to be read 100 years from now all the 
kings men is already a classic generations have read that 
book sullivan said 
his fellow writers marveled at his versatility and virtuosity 
hes astounding said poet robert bly its very seldom 
that someone can write poetry and fiction and do it well in 
fiction you take nine or ten generations and compress them in 
poetry you take 30 seconds and expand it 
rwb lewis the yale professor who produced an anthology of 
american literature with warren and is writing a book about him 
called warren the greatest person of letters in the country for 
several decades 
he was extraordinarily gifted in so many different ways as a 
novelist as a poet as a literary critic of extraordinary 
influence as a cultural historian said lewis 
but most were more interested in praising his character he was 
all agreed a great storyteller an ardent father his colleague 
allen tate once complained that all warren talked about in his 
letters was his children a voracious reader and hard worker a man 
of high standards 
he wasnt one of these polite gentle postworld war ii 
encouragers of the young said bly a younger poet when he saw 
something that was shoddy he named it whether it was in himself 
or in others 
he was born in kentucky and educated in tennessee and was known 
as a southern writer though he lived much of his life elsewhere 
his work was not confined to any place at all said miss 
welty 
he was a southerner in his manners and in his warmth and in his 
accent said sullivan but he once told me well you know my 
community is the world my friends are all over the world and my 
friends are my community he was a cosmopolitan but he had a lot 
of the south in him

from tarzan to indiana jones racism in the 
movies has created false notions and negative images of 
africanamericans held by both white and black people two veteran 
black actors said friday 
the dominant culture puts out so much misinformation in a 
relentless fashion that you are programmed against yourself said 
bernie casey recalling that as a child he rooted for tarzan to win 
against the africans 
i did not want to be one of the africans yet i am an african i 
would reject myself in the land of oogabooga i wanted no part 
of it casey said 
casey who has appeared in 25 movies and on television took part 
in a seminar with madge sinclair madge sinclair late of 
televisions trapper john 
in making their remarks during a seminar at the congressional 
black caucus weekend the two also urged listeners to write in to 
producers when they are pleased or displeased refuse to see films 
or rent videos that do not have black people in significant roles 
and form collectives to act on both ideas 
i never see a woody allen film sinclair said about the 
filmmaker who is acclaimed for filming slices of new york life yet 
whose few black characters frequently are butlers and maids 
i feel better when i dont subscribe to the images that deny my 
very existence 
the two agreed that loving black couples are rarely shown 
dashing black men are never the heros black people are thought to 
have lips that are too large thus few if any kissing scenes are ever 
filmed 
also tarzans successor indiana jones also was in films that 
speak to the evilness of the cultures of people of color and 
those dark peoples lack of ableness casey said 
he added that what is born out of misinformation is 
misperception and what is born of misperception is 
misunderstanding 
that has lead to among other things black people rejecting 
their culture by straigtening their hair to be more like white 
people casey said 
as long as you reject yourself you will never feel of any 
consequence casey said 
and added sinclair the world only knows about black people what 
is exported on film leading to japanese prime ministers being able 
to make disparaging remarks about the intelligence of blacks and 
latinos 
when she was growing up in jamaica sinclair said black people 
in films were always worthless shiftless bums or gangsters 
fortunately she said she and members of her family traveled to 
the united states and so we knew better 
recently sinclair said she was insulted by some black producers 
who were thinking of casting her 
but one of them told her he thought i was too polished too 
cultured could i get down or act in a more stereotypical black 
manner sinclair said 
that floored me and made me want to leave the business she 
said to the overflow crowd in a congressional hearing room on 
capitol hill thats what i expected from the other side 
but one of the worst incidents occurred when she went to a 
producer with a project by and about black people 
after presenting all of her arguments for something she thought 
black people would flock to see sinclair said the producer told 
her it doesnt matter what we put out there anything we put out 
there theyll go see 
too true the two actors said casey using conservative figures 
said that if 20 million blacks saw two movies a month at 3 a 
ticket that would equal 120 million a month and more than 1 
billion a year 
so if you think you are inconsequential stop it casey said 
a visiting black actor from great britain was taken aback by the 
discussion 
youve kind of blown me away we guys thought you were doing so 
well brian bovell said to much laughter during the question and 
answer portion of the program 
afterward he said black britons were aware of malcolm x dr 
martin luther king jr and also as seen through the movies that 
life in america was good 
it was presumed to be the same for blacks bovell said 
this has been brilliant for me

as workers who labored to remove the scars 
of the exxon valdez disaster left this port town on friday the 
state announced its own 21 million cleanup plan for the winter 
gov steve cowper said the winter program will include cleaning 
shorelines researching and developing cleanup technology that can 
be used next spring and protecting fish hatcheries and untainted 
environmentally sensitive areas 
exxon officials have pronounced 1100 miles of oilsmeared 
shoreline environmentally stable saying their 25week effort to 
remove gross contamination from shorelines in prince william sound 
was a job well done 
otto harrison general manager of exxons valdez operations said 
that while oil remained in some areas it was not enough to harm 
wildlife 
what youve seen is a coastline almost free of oil harrison 
said at a valdez news conference youre seeing the steady 
recovery of prince william sound 
officials at veco inc the primary contractor for exxon in the 
cleanup defended their work at a news conference on friday bert 
hartley vecos general manager said the removal of oil from 
beaches was herculean accomplishment 
that does not mean you cannot find oil on the beaches you can 
find oil if you look for it hartley said 
cowper was conciliatory toward exxon as he announced the state 
cleanup 
i think exxon has made a goodfaith efort to clean up the 
beaches the governor said im not going to fault exxon because 
they made some mistakes frankly some of the things the state has 
done were mistakes 
the state should have known more about dealing with a spill he 
said at least we should have known no one else knew how to do 
it cowper said 
the state work will be funded with an oil tax the alaska 
legislature passed this year and reimbursment will be sought from 
exxon the governor said 
state officials agreed some shorelines were cleaner because of 
exxons efforts but they disputed the companys rosey portrayal of 
an environmental rebound from nearly 11 million gallons of spilled 
crude 
dennis kelso the states environmental commissioner toured 
shorelines on two islands south of valdez on thursday and said he 
was not pleased with what he saw 
this beach is not environmentally stable he said as he poked 
a stick into thickly oiled rocks on knight island 
the knight island shoreline was one of the last treated by 
cleanup crews the air still was thick with the pungent smell of a 
chemical fertilizer recently sprayed on the rocks 
the fertilizer is supposed to stimulate microorganisms to break 
down the oil faster than they would normally kelso who had visited 
the same beach two weeks ago said the process has shown signs of 
success 
in other spots however it appeared the cleanup was rushed to 
meet exxons selfimposed cleanup deadline kelso said 
the commissioner said the state is asking exxon to do more 
research in the coming months to determine the chemicals possible 
side effects and whether the process does much more than remove 
surface oil 
exxon officials said that while the summer cleanup is over the 
company will continue to monitor the spill and respond to major 
problems about 300 cleanup workers will remain in alaska down from 
about 10000 at the height of the effort 
the spill on march 24th was the nations worst 1092 million 
gallons of crude gushed out when the ship ran aground

sinbad was a harddrinking old salt 
a legendary sailor promoted for battling german uboats and 
courtmartialed for being threesheetstothewind with his snout in 
the gutter 
mongrel or not sinbad the k9 sailor was a lucky charm for 
crewmates aboard the us coast guard cutter campbell who faced 
numerous world war ii battles without a single loss of life 
on friday sailors from almost a dozen states gathered around 
their comrades seaside grave to honor him with taps and a 
headstone placed atop the coast guards most famous dog 38 
years after his death 
a nineman color guard stood with flags dipped as a rifle squad 
sounded a salute while king reynolds a campbell veteran from 
tallahassee fla raised the flag over sinbads grave 
as taps filled the sea air the men of the campbell bowed their 
heads and cried 
he was as much a member of the crew as any one of us said 
george fuerth a veteran from lakehurst who served with sinbad he 
was there for all the battles and he was there for all the drinking 
he sailed the seven seas 
sinbads human companions got the idea of honoring the daring dog 
at their first reunion in 1986 they mulled it over and finally 
finished the memorial this year 
sinbad served aboard the campbell for 77 dog years from 1937 
until he was retired in 1948 to a coast guard station along the new 
jersey shore sinbad died when he was 15 years old 
sinbad began his military career as a stowaway smuggled aboard 
by a coast guardsman the ships captain planned to dump sinbad at 
the first port but became attached to the dog and allowed him to 
stay 
during his dog days he had his own bunk and personnel file 
where his exploits were documented along with his promotions and 
demotions 
he would appear at roll call with life jacket in mouth dropping 
it to bark his reply when his name was yelled his best friends 
remembered but what stands out most about sinbad was that he lived 
a dogs life like a true sailor 
he was found in the bronx one day passed out in a gutter 
said nicholas stepich of new york a former gun captain aboard the 
campbell he was totally inebriated a woman saw his coast guard 
tag and called us and we sent a jeep out to get him then we had to 
send another jeep to get the guy who was supposed to pick up sinbad 
we figured the two got into a drinking contest 
well known in the taverns near the navy yards in new york citys 
brooklyn borough and bostons old scollay square sinbad would hop 
atop the bar stool and woof down a few whiskeys with beer chasers 
stepich said 
a 1943 life magazine article condensed in readers digest 
documents the sailors dog tales 
universal pictures made a waryears documentary on the plucky 
pooch and when we showed it at our reunion there wasnt a dry 
eye in the place stepich said 
drinking like a st bernard however did not come without its 
price to the barrelchested mutt 
sinbad made chief dog the highest rank the animal could attain 
in the coast guard and the crew partied till dawn but a few 
drunken binges had him busted back to dog firstclass 
bill liming of sacramento calif told the crowd of about 100 
people at the ceremonies about serving on the disciplinary board 
he just stared at me he said i noted no remorse or 
emotion from sinbad sinbad was a whitehat his jaunty stride was 
that of a seasoned sailor 
when he retired however sinbad went out top dog mostly for his 
bravery and for keeping the crew safe 
the idea was that nothing would happen to anyone while sinbad 
was aboard stepich said we had a few men wounded but nobody 
killed even today i begin to wonder how that could be 
sinbads closest brush came when the campbell took on six german 
uboats the coast guard ship rammed and sunk the last of the enemy 
vessels but bobbed powerless in the sea for three days afterward 
about 100 men stayed aboard with sinbad as the campbell its 
engine room flooded was towed perilously back to port 
the main thoughts were that you were pretty much closer to god 
than at any time in your life stepich said god and sinbad

australias qintex group won a brief 
but bitter bidding war for mgmua communications corp on friday 
with a 15 billion buyout offer topping media magnate rupert 
murdoch by 100 million 
qintex a television and real estate concern also will assume 
400 million in junk bond debt bringing its total acquisition costs 
to 19 billion 
kirk kerkorian who owns 82 percent of mgmua already had sold 
many of the assets of the old mgm and united artists studios 
the high price was attributed to mgmuas 4000picture library 
of movies including gone with the wind and the wizard of 
oz which are alluring assets at a time of great worldwide 
appetite for us entertainment 
we believe the global development of not just television but 
movies is going to exceed inflation by a wide margin said john 
lloyd qintexs chief financial officer 
david evans qintex president and chief executive said another 
big factor was kerkorians willingness to sell the famous mgm lion 
logo which he previously had jealously guarded 
there are people who will claim we paid too much he said 
but it is arguably the secondmost recognizable logo in the 
world behind the cocacola logo id put the value of the logo in 
some hundreds of millions of dollars 
kerkorian had been seeking a buyer for all or part of the company 
for 18 months nearly every big american company with entertainment 
holdings as well as japans sony corp had expressed interest 
qintex announced a deal in april to buy mgmuas united artists 
studio and some other assets for 600 million at the time the fox 
inc unit of murdochs news corp was the final suitor to drop out 
of the bidding 
in a surprise move wednesday murdoch bid 14 billion for all of 
mgmua but negotiations between mgms board and murdochs news 
corp and its fox inc unit broke down late thursday 
by bettering murdochs deal for all of mgmua qintex chairman 
christopher skase turned the tables on his fellow australian 
murdoch whose holdings include the fox studio had hosted a 
cocktail party to introduce skase to hollywoods elite after the 
qintex deal was announced in april 
when murdoch reentered the picture wednesday skase was in the 
process of buying for 8 million the palatial los angeles estate of 
the late edie goetz the daughter of the late louis b mayer one of 
mgms founders 
a source close to skase speaking on condition of anonymity said 
skase had been angered by murdochs offer although not surprised by 
it 
neither murdoch nor skase was available for interviews friday 
murdoch spokesman howard rubenstein said mgmua had asked murdoch 
to bid for the company he thought he had a deal but then the 
transaction fell apart he said declining to comment further 
qintex owns an australian television network and 43 percent of a 
us company that produces tv movies and specials including the 
lonesome dove miniseries 
ted turner owns worldwide television broadcast rights and 
domestic paytv rights to the 3000picture mgm library which 
includes pre1950s warners bros releases but qintex will get 
domestic and foreign home video rights to that library as well as 
nonus paytv rights 
the 1000movie united artists library includes the rocky 
pink panther and james bond pictures

president mikhail gorbachev urged compromise upon 
the leaders of lithuania latvia and estonia at a moscow meeting on 
economic reform plans and ethnic tensions in the baltics tass said 
friday 
nationalist movements have sprung up in those three baltic 
republics and other regions 
the official news agency said gorbachev told communist leaders of 
the three republics on wednesday that what is needed is 
consolidation reciprocity a search for sensible compromises 
the baltics have been pushing gorbachevs economic reforms and 
won approval from the national parliament to carry out plans for 
economic autonomy beginning jan 1 
gorbachev wants economic restructuring but maintains the 
communist party should play the leading role in those reforms 
tass said gorbachev told the baltic leaders that the main 
current difficulty is that the longterm goals come against 
striking problems which reflect the current needs of people 
it said he told them they had to move actively but not 
forget the three fundamentals from which we have no right to 
deviate 
he listed these as solving all problems only in the framework 
of the federation unity of the party the main guarantor of 
perestroika and the process of national revival and equality of 
the citizens of all nationalities 
soviet officials say gorbachev took part in writing a statement 
from the communist party central committee in late august warning 
baltic residents that separatism would not be in their interests 
on aug 23 more than 1 million baltic residents joined hands to 
protest the 50th anniversary of a nazisoviet agreement in which 
josef stalin incorporated the previously independent baltic states 
into the soviet union 
harry tiido an editor of the official estonian radio said in a 
telephone interview from tallinn that the republics communist party 
chief vaino vyalyas president arnold ruutel and premier indrek 
toome attended the meeting 
tiido quoted estonian leaders as saying gorbachev expressed a 
willingness to put pressure through the politburo on ministries in 
moscow that might try to slow down economic reform 
he said that vyalyas dodged questions on ethnic tensions in 
interviews after the meeting 
last month nonestonians went on strike to protest a law 
imposing residency requirements for voting and running for local 
office in the republic 
tass said in its account that gorbachev told the leaders on 
wednesday that perestroika his term for economic and social 
restructuring can succeed only if the party ranks are united 
it would be a grave historic mistake to weaken such a powerful 
political organism as the communist party of the soviet union 
also on friday the communist party daily pravda accused members 
of the ukraines new narodni rukh political movement of seeking to 
undermine kremlin authority and take power itself in the republic 
the narodni rukh ended a threeday founding congress last sunday

prompted by a shooting spree that left 
eight dead and 13 wounded at a printing plant a state lawmaker said 
friday he would sponsor a bill in the general assembly to outlaw 
assault weapons 
we owe it to the families and the other victims to try at least 
to make it harder for a deranged person to obtain the weapon said 
freshman rep mike ward a democrat 
ward said he would file a bill for the legislative session that 
begins in january despite a key house leaders assessment that the 
measures chance of passing would be slim 
the national rifle association which helped defeat gun control 
legislation in the general assembly in 1984 was unconcerned about 
the bill a spokesman for the firearms lobby said 
the issue was revived after thursdays rampage at standard 
gravure corp by a heavily armed employee with a history of mental 
illness joseph t wesbecker killed seven people with a chinesemade 
semiautomatic ak47 assault rifle then killed himself with a 
germanmade 9mm pistol 
the small arsenal he carted into the plant in a gym bag included 
two mac11 machine pistols a 38caliber revolver and hundreds of 
rounds of ammunition 
a person bent on such mayhem would not be stopped by an antigun 
bill said william e smith the league of kentucky sportsmens 
representative to the nra 
you just cant legislate against a nut said smith 
rep greg stumbo a cardcarrying nra member who as house 
majority floor leader helps control the flow of legislation said 
ward would have an uphill fight for his bill 
house leaders usually allow any bill to go to the floor for a 
vote if and its a big if it makes it out of committee said 
stumbo a democrat i dont think the chances of that measure 
would be very good stumbo said 
louisville and lexington once had ordinances requiring a waiting 
period for handgun buyers but that changed in the 1984 general 
assembly with a bill backed by the nra 
the bill which sailed through both the house and senate 
prohibited local governments from enacting guncontrol measures of 
any type 
but now with this proliferation of highpowered assault 
weapons attitudes of the general public are changing we just have 
to see that these weapons are different ward said 
i think the nra will discredit itself by opposing a ban on 
assault rifles because assault rifles are not in any way a sporting 
weapon there would be nothing left of a squirrel to eat after it 
had been shot with an ak47 ward said 
smith said the nra was extremely sorry about the terrible thing 
that happened but that nothing has changed about the 
organizations opposition to gun legislation 
the tragedy was not due simply to wesbeckers possession of 
automatic or semiautomatic weapons he said the man could have 
walked into that place with a pump shotgun and done a lot more 
damage than he did with this socalled assault rifle smith said 
louisville police chief richard dotson called for a national ban 
on assault weapons saying what do you need these for except for 
killing people 
and archbishop thomas kelly alluded to guncontrol laws at a mass 
for the shooting victims 
we are a democratic society kelly said weve got to be 
able to find ways to keep this from happening again 
but it will not be prevented with legislation like wards smith 
said 
i dont think it will ever happen in our state he said

a twoweek curfew was suspended thursday in medellin mayor juan 
gomez said the curfew was lifted because the city of 2 million had 
returned to absolute normalcy 
earlier friday four bombs exploded at banks in bogota 
banks have been major targets of bombings since the government 
launched a crackdown on the drug trade a month ago 
no one claimed responsibility for any of fridays attacks 
also friday the defense ministry ordered the countrys 
200000member army and the national police on alert and reinforced 
security at many buildings in anticipation of violence on the eve of 
the day of love and friendship colombians exchange gifts on 
saturdays holiday 
in eastern canada colombians jose ali galindoescobar and 
fernando augusto mendozajaramillo were ordered held for trial next 
month on charges of importing 1100 pounds of cocaine they were 
arrested and the drugs seized in april 
their hearing in the new brunswick town of fredericton was held 
thursday under tight security following the arrests wednesday in 
canada of five armed men 
inspector al hutchinson of the royal canadian mounted police in 
fredericton said friday the two canadian cases are linked but he 
gave no details 
us officials said two of arrested men are colombian although 
all held venezuelan passports 
the arrests in colombia were announced in a communique from the 
4th army brigade in medellin the site of almost daily bombings 
shootings and arson attacks since the government and its cocaine 
cartels declared war on each other last month 
the united states has been helping colombia in the crackdown and 
gen oscar botero restrepo colombias defense minister said friday 
that argentina would be sending various airplanes 
however he gave no details and there was no immediate 
confirmation from argentine officials 
the army said the 28 arrested belonged to the national liberation 
army which is one of six leftist guerrilla groups operating in this 
south american country 
the communique did not say when the 28 were arrested or what 
specific terrorist acts they were accused of committing 
we have succeeded in capturing an entire gang of bandits from 
the socalled national liberation army that together with 
narcotraffickers have been carrying out terrorist acts around 
medellin it said 
it would be unusual for leftist guerrillas to work with drug 
cartels 
drug organizations here traditionally have considered guerrillas 
their enemies and have funded hit squads aimed at killing leftist 
sympathizers 
drug traffickers also view the armyguerrilla confrontations in 
remote regions as getting in the way of their cocaine processing and 
shipping operations 
since president virgilio barco decreed special emergency powers 
aug 18 to aid in the antinarcotics fight authorities have been 
rounding up drug suspects and seizing bank accounts and property 
presumed linked to the traffickers 
the emergency measures temporarily suspend some constitutional 
guarantees and allow suspects to be held for eight days without 
being formally charged 
the current crackdown started after drug gangs aug 18 
assassinated the leading presidential candidate sen luis carlos 
galan a foe of the traffickers 
also friday a us official in bogota backed up a declaration 
made the day before by botero restrepo who said there were no 
american military advisers in the country 
the problem is the word advisers they arent advisers we 
have trainers and technicians said the us official who spoke 
to foreign reporters on the condition of anonymity 
consternation arose in colombia following reports from washington 
that president bush had deployed troops to help fight narcotics in 
colombia bolivia and peru

on june 34 to suppress studentled prodemocracy demonstrators 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people died as troops shot 
their way into the city on their way to capture tiananmen square 
from student demonstrators 
since then chinese and foreign sources have reported that deng is 
seriously ill from prostrate cancer chinese officials have asserted 
that deng is in good health and spent part of the summer resting at 
the seaside resort of beidaihe 
speculation that deng was no longer capable of carrying out his 
official functions rose when he failed to meet the president of 
burkina faso during a recent visit 
vice premier yao yilin however reportedly recently told a 
delegation from hong kong that deng continues to swim a halfhour 
daily and would appear in public during oct 1 national day

a federal judge on thursday approved the 
demolition of eight buildings in two housing projects in a 
compromise that was struck after a proposal to knock down nearly 
five times as many highrises drew fire 
in addition to demolishing buildings containing about 1900 
apartments the agreement between the newark housing authority and 
tenants groups calls for the renovation or construction of more than 
3000 apartments for poor people 
nearly 3 million in federal housing and urban development funds 
are committed to the renovations and construction 
the city originally had planned to tear down 3900 buildings 
containing about 5700 units tenants and advocates for the homeless 
said the plan would swell the number of homeless people in newark 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise tentatively approved 
the plan on aug 17 but delayed final approval until thursday to 
give officials time to distribute copies of the pact to tenants and 
federal housing officials 
there was some disagreement but none of the parties involved 
wanted to jeapordize the hud funding in the agreement said the 
judge whose courtroom was packed with tenants and many on the 
authoritys long waiting lists 
under the agreement buildings containing 1506 apartments in the 
columbus homes project and about 400 at the kretchmer homes will be 
demolished most of the units in those two projects are already 
vacant 
the pact requires the city to break ground for the 1776 new 
units it has promised to build before beginning demolition at 
columbus homes and to repair and fill 1632 vacant apartments before 
demolition at the other project 
many of those attending thursdays hearing took the opportunity 
to complain about the housing authoritys efforts to provide 
lowincome housing 
about onethird of newarks 316000 residents receive public 
assistance the housing authority is the eighth largest in the 
nation with 13000 apartments 
the original plan to destroy most of the citys highrise 
projects reflected a trend toward lowrise public housing which is 
considered more manageable by many officials

how to fight colombias drug lords one 
suggestion on fox broadcastings the reporters saturday try 
something like the phoenix program of selective assassinations 
of viet cong leaders that went on during the vietnam war 
that would be a tad controversial but then it comes from a 
controversial soldier retired army col david h hackworth a 
highlydecorated combat veteran of the korean and vietnam wars 
to win a war of terrorism you have to employ terrorism he 
says 
although the phoenix program certainly did get out of control 
at times he says on the show it worked very effectively in 
vietnam 
he doesnt advocate us participation in such an effort in 
colombia or say who should set it up 
but in fighting the drug battle he says a program like that 
a covert program is needed to win the war against the cocaine 
barons and their underlings the key to it he says is to create 
that fear that they dont know if theyre going to be here 
tomorrow 
strong words from a man who made headlines in 1971 by breaking 
ranks from his colleagues while still on active duty in vietnam he 
did it in an abc issues and answers interview in which he 
sharply criticized the armys vietnam training and tactics and all 
but declared the war unwinnable 
the flamboyant aussie steve dunleavy is both the anchor and chief 
correspondent of saturdays the reporters a special called 
narc war the southern front 
but hackworth is there in three unusual roles as the specials 
military advisor as an interviewee and on a limited basis as an 
interviewer of some of the colombian armys officers and men who are 
fighting the drug war 
this complex upfromtheranks soldier now lives in australia 
is an advocate of nuclear arms reduction and on saturdays show he 
urges killing the stealth bomber and star wars programs among other 
military things and using the money instead for what he calls 
this real war on drugs 
his recentlypublished memoirs about face are true to his 
pullnopunches style 
it is likely that eyebrows will be raised that hackworth is on 
the reporters as both an advocate of ways to fight the drug war 
and as a sortof reporter on the battle it is considered good form 
in traditional journalism to keep the roles of advocate and reporter 
separate 
that he is on the show is due to gerald stone executive producer 
of the reporters he says he knew hackworth from his own days in 
australia and knew his vietnam combat background 
stone says he thought that hackworths perspective would would 
make him the ideal guest expert for a special on the colombian 
militarys fight against drug terrorists and producers a fight that 
some have likened to the early days of the vietnam war 
this was the first time he had done something like this 
stone says he was very effective in the role and so wed like to 
use him more in future stories about the drug war in latin america 
im not sure whether he wants to do that he said the last 
time i talked to him he wanted to go off to a farm in montana 
but this might stir him up 
stones show launched in july last year and often cited as a 
prime example of tabloid tv starts its second season on sept 30 
ironically at a time some network news programs have been accused 
of edging toward the tabloid stone says his series is moving the 
other way 
he says ive been moving it into a more classical 60 minutes 
church 
that durable cbs congregation incidentally starts its 22nd 
season on sunday with meredith vieira and steve kroft now part of 
the 60 minutes flock headed by founderexecutive producer don 
hewitt 
its leadoff piece a good one is mike wallaces trip with adm 
william crowe outgoing chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
during last summers unprecedented visit by crowe to soviet military 
installations 
in one scene in which wallace interviews a top soviet general a 
little editorial needling of a rival seems afoot one clearly sees 
an nbc news cameraman taping away behind wallace 
60 minutes chief hewitt says he isnt worried that the 
syndicated rash of socalled realitybased tabloid series this 
fall will affect his highrated broadcasts ratings by surfeiting 
viewers with too much er news 
id like to believe that were different he adds 
furthermore he says of tabloid tv shows i dont watch em

in an obscure suburban rehearsal hall raffi 
prepared to return to his preschool audience after a oneyear 
sabbatical took the childrens entertainer away from the grind of 
concert tours 
he and his fourpiece band ran through every chord and gesture 
certain to delight a young crowd from shake my sillies out to 
the nonsense words that turn apples and bananas into ooples 
and banoonoos 
raffi has sold more than 4 million records and created a oneman 
cottage industry of childrens books and videos based on the 
principle that little kids and their parents can be treated with 
respect 
he is slowly returning to work instead of the usual string of 
concerts he has scheduled only six shows in september four of them 
in canada and two at new yorks carnegie hall 
then raffi who uses just his first name plans to spend the fall 
recording his first album that wont be aimed exclusively to an 
audience five years old or younger 
the attempt to broaden his audience allows greater vocabulary and 
more difficult concepts than in his previous work but doesnt mean 
hes not happy with his role as a childrens entertainer 
the sabbatical he explained en route to his office after the 
rehearsal finished for the day was spent mostly at home in toronto 
and consisted of no concerts no interviews and no thinking about 
a next record 
it took me out of the treadmill out of the career demands 
the 41yearold folksinger said it allowed me to listen to my own 
inner voice again 
his trademark beard still intact and dressed in tshirt and 
casual pants for the practice session raffi said he wanted to take 
the time to examine what hed done recently and take stock of where 
he was 
for me i just had to really examine all this touring and the 
tremendous amount of travel it took he said in 1987 and 1988 he 
chalked up 200 soldout concerts in 70 cities across the united 
states and canada 
he sorted through fan mail some of it with words and some solely 
of scrawls and pictures as he settled into his comfortable office 
little of this could have been anticipated when he turned to 
childrens entertaining in 1974 just six years after his family 
emigrated to canada from egypt 
i couldnt conceive where this would go whatsoever he 
recalled of his start it was literally not knowing what you were 
doing 
he recorded his first album of childrens songs singable songs 
for the very young in 1976 but didnt stop thinking of himself 
as a folksinger who happened to do some childrens music on the side 
until two years later 
it took me that long to discover the true value of the career 
that opened he said 
now with eight albums half a million raffi books in print and 
two concert videos out raffi has discovered what larger 
corporations in childrens entertainment have long known that a 
completely new preschool audience is ready every few years 
that means all his merchandise can perpetually stay in book and 
record stores 
im an entertainer of children and their families raffi 
said its such a new undertaking theres room for many 
especially the ones who are doing it for the right reasons 
except for the concert videos that were conceived as being 
interactive he has stayed away from television because he believes 
the medium contradicts childrens basic nature to be doers rather 
than viewers 
tv is not a natural friend of the young child raffi said 
the two videos that i have were a compromise 
his songs are simple tuneful thoughtful and fun 
did you ever see a whale with a polkadot tail he may ask in 
down by the bay while in one light one sun he sings of 
one song heard by everyone one love one heart one heart warming 
everyone 
perhaps his biggest innovation in childrens entertainment may be 
that in gearing his songs to a young audience he didnt forget that 
they shouldnt grate on an older one either 
some childrens entertainment he said seems to have been 
created on the assumption that a saccharinelike quality had to 
be present 
if youre comfortable in your respect for children as whole 
people theres no need to speak to them in a condescending way 
he said 
the entertainer said for example that he believes a 3yearold 
fans question of raffi how did you get out of my tape should 
be considered a realistic perception 
im just respecting the difference he said any 
entertainer has to know his audience its just that simple 
raffi who is separated from his wife has no children but said 
he draws on what he has learned in performing and his own memories 
plans for the new album are to call it evergreen everblue 
featuring songs with environmental themes most were written on 
sabbatical but three from earlier albums including one light one 
sun just like the sun and big beautiful planet will be 
freshly recorded 
he said he was deeply affected by the environmental news of the 
past year 
it just struck me how prevalent the global mess really was 
raffi said 
one of the new songs clean rain is about acid rain a topic 
of consistent concern in canada and will say i remember the days 
when the rain fell clean 
another spark for interest in environmental issues came from 
another onename pop star sting who stopped in toronto on tour to 
call attention to the devastation of the brazil rain forest 
that was an interesting meeting raffi recalled it turned 
out stings kids were fans of mine

people expect great things from cameron mackintosh 
the producer of cats les miserables and the phantom of 
the opera 
but a musical set in vietnam thats something else 
its another emotional roller coaster the tonywinning 
millionaire said of miss saigon his mostanticipated 
blockbuster to date 
the 465 millionshow opening sin vietnam prior 
to the 1975 fall of saigon and then picks up in 1978 
the musical at the theater royal dept 20 is set rury lane reworks 
the 
madama butterfly story about the doomed liaison between an 
american naval officer and his japanese bride 
it stars welsh actor jonathan pryce as a vietnamese pimp simon 
bowman and claire moore as the lovesick american gi and his wife 
and 18yearold filipino actress lea salonga in her western stage 
debut as kim the musicals tragic heroine 
miss saigon reteams mackintosh with alain boublil and 
claudemichel schonberg the awardwinning french authors of les 
miserables which is well on its way to being the most 
internationally successful musical ever 
richard maltby jr the tonywinning broadway director of aint 
misbehavin and song and dance cowrote ther over three years and 
its 
preopening ticket sale of 775 million is believed to be a london 
record 
mackintosh said its appeal differs from that of les 
miserables which was based on victor hugos epic 1862 novel and 
has been running in london almost four years 
miss saigon doesnt have the revivalist emotion of the end of 
les mis he said referring to the earlier musicals final 
number they all start singing when tomorrow comes and 
theres a terrific surge of powerful emotion about survival 
mackintosh said the new musical by contrast presents an 
intimate tragedy about a girl who gives up her life and that he 
and his collaborators did not intend miss saigon as an overt 
political broadside 
its set against the vietnam war but you could equally though 
not necessarily as effectively set the story in argentina south 
africa or wherever colonialism rears its head he said 
we all militantly eschewed a political statement said 
maltby we believe any political statement will emerge from the 
events onstage 
its hard to miss a parallel between the war itself and what 
happens to this vietnamese girl 
miss saigon is expected to arrive on broadway late next year 
but mackintosh said this may well be his last megamusical for a 
while 
ive had more than my share of luck i really cant cope with 
looking after any more shows said the 43yearold producer who 
will spend 1991 producing the movie of les miserables to be 
directed by alan parker mississippi burning 
his hit musicals have generated a truly international theater 
stretching across america europe and asia but he said in an 
interview im beginning to lose my enthusiasm for it 
people say whats your next biggie going to be and i think 
who cares all that matters is that what we do we do well

consumers seem to understand a lot more about 
inflation than theyve been given credit for their actions prove it 
unlike the behavior of the 1970s when the mere mention of the 
word sent people running to the store to buy things before prices 
rose thus assuring that prices would rise todays consumer 
remains calm 
its a good thing too because the noise made by inflation 
alarmists in recent months recalls world war ii days when air raid 
sirens sent people scurrying to cellars before the bombs fell 
throughout this year the inflation alarmists have screamed 
warnings every time the government released another monthly report 
on prices and theyre ready to do it again today the scheduled 
release date for august producer prices 
unlike the situation in the 1970s however people arent rushing 
to buy theyre taking their time instead forcing automakers into 
granting discounts and theyre avoiding items on which prices have 
risen sharply 
this avoidance behavior isnt much publicized but it is very 
real people are indeed switching from inflated items to what they 
consider better buys and you can demonstrate it from the numbers 
there are many measures of inflation the most popular being the 
consumer price index the cpi is based on prices of a basket of 
goods and services items in that basket were chosen in 1982 based 
on existing shopping patterns 
another measurement is called the gross national product implicit 
price deflator it measures not just prices but changes in spending 
patterns too the items in the basket vary in keeping with changes 
in shopping behavior 
since 1982 the implicit price deflator has averaged 04 percent 
per year less than the fixed basket index the difference is 
significant and it can mean only one thing consumers have been 
avoiding inflated items 
why this should be so isnt as clear as the fact that it is 
happening 
it could be in reaction to the foolishness of the 1970s it could 
reflect greater competition and more goods in the marketplace 
because of imports education might be play a role instinct too 
confidence in government maybe 
one of the likely possibilities is that consumers have been 
forced into selectivity because workers earnings havent been 
growing explosively as they did in some periods of the 1970s 
squeeze inflation from the numbers in fact and you can see that 
average hourly earnings are no higher than a decade ago 
whatever the reason the results are clear although shoppers may 
have little flexibility in deciding what items to buy they have 
been exercising choice where they can otherwise the statistical 
pattern wouldnt be so clear 
this change wont silence the alarmists unable to break the bad 
habit they will still scream their warnings you might recall that 
in the ford administration they screamed all the way down into the 
pit of recession 
the big difference between now and the 1970s however is that 
their audience is more critical and informed consumers arent being 
panicked into buying instead theyre remaining cool and selective

about four miles from halls home in saugerties 
i tend to have all these grandiose plans wanting to stop 
nuclear power and things like that hall said its kind of 
ironic that a dump and an incinerator would get me involved in 
this 
the balding 41yearold singersongwriter wore a stop the 
dump tshirt to a recent interview talking at length of the 
intricate inner workings of local politics he joked that he and his 
wife were planning to celebrate their 20th anniversary by crashing a 
closed republican caucus 
after initially rejecting the town committees request to run for 
office hall changed his mind figuring it would give him another 
platform to campaign against the dump 
hall dismisses talk that his pop music background could hinder 
his political career 
i suppose some people might think that musicians are frivolous 
or that artists of any kind are less substantial people than the 
lawyers and accountants who make up the political mainstream he 
said i dont think thats true and i think my involvement in 
issues concerning saugerties for the last 10 years shows that 
hall is one of six people running for four open seats in his 
district saugerties is republican territory but halls name 
recognition and local anger over the proposed incinerator give him a 
better than even chance of winning said republican leader mathews 
it also doesnt hurt when an old friend such as bonnie raitt 
comes in for a fundraising concert hall now has nearly 20000 for 
himself and other democratic candidates 
what can i do quipped mathews about having to counter 
appearances by famous rock stars i can play the radio 
sanders background has attracted more attention one of the 
fugs betterknown antics was unsuccessfully trying to enter 
czechoslovakia to masturbate in front of invading soviet tanks 
according to the rolling stone encyclopedia of rock amp roll 
russell roefs sanders opponent has run radio advertisements 
noting that he was fighting in vietnam at the same time sanders was 
demonstrating against the war and being arrested for distributing 
obscene literature the charges were later dropped 
at a time in which judge douglas ginsburgs us supreme court 
nomination was scuttled because of past marijuana experimentation a 
politicians history is fair game roefs said 
a persons background usually predicts his views for his entire 
life roefs said i cant believe that we have people in this 
society that constantly change and become good guys and bad guys 
overnight 
sanders said hes 50 years old now and mainstream enough to get 
federal grants for poetry during the reagan administration he said 
hes always voted as a democrat 
ive always been an american sanders said im proud of 
it its just that i could not support the war in vietnam 
some of his satirical work would be considered tame today he 
said 
go listen to rodney dangerfield go to a george carlin 
concert sanders said what i did in my wild youth is nothing 
compared to what you can hear at a catskills resort 
sanders won an early test in september by finishing first in a 
threeway democratic primary his task in the general election is 
generally considered tougher even though his district includes the 
artsy enclave of woodstock 
both sanders and hall are trying to crack a 33member legislature 
that has 28 republicans 
hall still performs music but he has no record contract he and 
his wife concentrate on writing songs for country artists such as 
juice newton chet atkins the oak ridge boys and others 
he still earns about 20000 a year in royalties for each of his 
two hit songs and is constantly considering offers to use the songs 
in commercial endorsements that makes it easier to swallow the 
8000 annual salary of an ulster county legislator 
my main job for the last year and a half has been community 
organizing hall said ive spent many more hours working on 
zoning and illegal junkyards than i have writing and performing 
as for political ambitions beyond the ulster county legislature 
he said its really too early to speculate about that first ive 
got to get elected and stop the dump

moments after marcella gautier opens for 
business each morning her regular customers begin arriving for 
their daily fix 
the customers bluecollar workers for the most part quickly 
purchase a small amount of the fine white powder they have come 
for many of them ingest it on the spot 
they tell me they need some of my powder to get them going in 
the morning she says 
if it sounds as if something illegals going on here no one in 
midway would be misled 
midway you see is midway between salisbury and winstonsalem 
two of the regions remaining three headache powder producers 
mister youre smack in the middle of headache powder 
country gautier told a reporter we sell oodles of the stuff 
she pointed to a shelf crammed full with packets of bc 
stanback and goodys the last remaining brands in an industry that 
once had scores of competitors 
the powdery concoction traditionally a potent mixture of 
aspirin and caffeine used to be called production powder in 
the tobacco and textile mills that proliferated throughout the 
southeast after the turn of the century 
the tobacco and textile mills were hot noisy places and the 
workers needed something that would give them quick relief from 
the long hours and bad working conditions said tom chambers 
president and chief executive of winstonsalembased goodys he 
noted the first powders came on the market around 1910 
dozens of druggists throughout the south and especially the 
carolinas came up with their own special formulas in the late 
1920s winstonsalem druggist mc goody goodman combined 
powdered caffeine aspirin and the analgesic acetaminophen 
for lack of a beter name he called his mixture goodys 
said chambers a local entrepreneur a thad lewallen purchased 
the rights to goodmans creation in 1932 and began marketing goodys 
across the region 
there were more than 100 companies back then although some of 
them were oneman operations 
goodys has always been a winstonsalem firm the company 
currently occupies a renovated overalls factory just down the street 
from where goody goodman used to dispense the original product over 
the counter 
chambers can recall the days when goodys and competing powders 
were sold inside the mills from socalled dope carts that also 
offered cigarettes coffee and cookies 
theyre still sold in the mills today but through vending 
machines he said a packet of two powders sells for about half a 
dollar 
the three companies that survived bc goodys and stanback 
did so because they were better able to promote and market their 
product chambers said marketing was the key because the 
ingredients werent all that different 
theres one notable exception to that bc and goodys still 
contain caffeine but stanback dropped the stimulant in 1984 it 
hasnt worked worth a darn william stanback son of the companys 
founder said of the move 
stanback located at nearby salisbury and goodys are still 
small family owned operations bc which began in durham nc 
was bought out by the block drug co in the mid1960s and was moved 
to memphis tenn 
industry insiders generally recognize bc which was concocted 
in 1910 by the late commodore thomas council as being the first 
commercial headache powder to appear on the market 
the headache powder industry grew rapidly in the 1920s and 30s 
chambers said it continued to expand until world war ii when 
mechanization reduced the work forces at the plants and mills across 
the region 
today headache powders account for about 50 million of the 
annual 14 billion analgesic market they remain primarily a 
regional product 
id never heard of headache powders when i came to the south a 
few years ago said peter brown chairman of the anthropology 
department at emory university in atlanta 
even now he said one of our medical residents 
occasionally will tell me about seeing a patient who told him he was 
taking goodys for his health problem the resident will look at me 
and ask what are these things goodys 
because of the industrys promotion efforts chambers said fewer 
people ask that question these days 
everybody thought the powders would die when the older users 
died off but through our advertising and marketing weve begun 
reaching a wider market chambers said used to be most of our 
customers were rural farm people but the surveys show that the young 
have begun taking headache powers 
connie watson a 24yearold store clerk in salisbury said she 
became a regular user last year i had a headache and didnt want 
to buy a whole bottle of tables she recalled now i take a 
powder about every day 
novices should be warned that there is an art to taking the 
powders 
be sure and wash it down quick chambers said grinning 
marcella gautier can tell you this is sound advice 
i never take those powders she said i tried one once and 
like to choked to death i found youve got to be careful not to 
breathe in until youve swallowed all the powder

elvis presley with memphis drawl and swiveling 
hips was one of hollywoods indian actors so was rock hudson 
dame judith anderson who astounded audiences as medea and the 
evil housekeeper in rebecca was another famous indian 
actor cast as buffalo cow head in a man called horse 
today the war paint may be off but whites continue to play 
indians a casting practice all too common in an industry in which 
indians comprise only a tiny percentage 
hollywood has long ignored accuracy and fairness in its hiring 
practices using white actors to portray blacks asians and 
hispanics as far as indian roles were concerned all it took was a 
little burnt sienna pancake cliche costumes and cartoon accents for 
white actors to be transformed into the red man 
the latest motion picture about indians is war party written 
by spencer eastman the movie to be released this fall by hemdale 
films stars billy wirth and kevin dillon as halfbreeds living in 
binger mont the site 100 years ago of the milk river battle in 
which black cherokees were massacred by us soldiers wirth is part 
huron but dillon has no indian blood 
wirth is one of the few indian actors who have managed to get 
work over the years others include chief dan george who starred in 
1971s little big man chief john big tree used frequently by 
john ford and charles stevens the grandson of geronimo who 
appeared in douglas fairbanks westerns 
roddam who depicted british workingclass kids in 
quadrophenia and the plight of a black youth at a military 
academy in lords of discipline used a largely indian cast in 
war party but insisted that commercial considerations became 
more important when considering the leads 
i took all these nonactors in he said i did a film test 
and trained them but in the end the studio didnt feel they had the 
experience to be in a 9 million movie if you want to make this 
movie youre going to have to compromise on the main two guys 
in war party wirth slays a local redneck in self defense and 
is forced to flee with dillon and other indians they eventually 
band together vowing not to give in to the authorities 
you can make a small film that no one will see like pow wow 
highway or a larger film that a larger number of people will 
see roddam said at the end of the film youre cheering for 
these two indian boys you want them to win you side with them in 
lords of discipline you side with the black kid 
to cast his movie roddam consulted the american indian registry 
for the performing arts created in 1983 with the intention of 
finding work for indians in the entertainment business 
bob hicks until recently the organizations executive director 
dismissed the excuses usually given for casting nonindians 
our numbers are so small that hollywood has a tendency not to 
take us seriously he said just the fact that they went and 
cast a nonindian to play the lead because the director needed a 
strong person is proof theyll always tell us that we did look at 
indians but none of them could do the job 
david wacks repo man traveled across the country searching 
for actors to star in powwow highway a critical hit that failed 
at the box office earlier this year 
we went to oklahoma albuquerque and sante fe and were up in 
montana we did casting in south dakota minneapolis and canada 
there are very very few experienced indian actors and virtually 
all of them are in the movie he said 
wacks cast gary farmer a mohawk who grew up on a reservation 
and a martinez who is part blackfoot as the leads in the movie 
about two cheyennes buddy red bow and philbert bono who travel 
from their reservation in montana to new mexico where buddys sister 
has been arrested for drug possession 
theres more than enough talent out there theres a lot of 
talent said farmer 
roddam however said that casting indians to play indians was 
not absolutely necessary 
it comes to the point where you say do you have to have a 
real killer play charles manson i was committed to portraying the 
indians in a correct way i filmed it in a real indian town the 
people on the reservation were just thrilled he said 
white liberals get very huffy about the way we portray indians 
but the people in the town were really thrilled they 
appreciated that we were bringing this money into their economy 
through the end of 1988 there were 170 indians in the 
70000member screen actors guild blacks numbered 5247 and 
hispanics 2439 
certainly the guilds approach with respect to trying to remedy 
this situation is the goslow approach said rodney mitchell the 
guilds affirmativeaction coordinator we try to engage the 
producers in discussions and dialogue secure their cooperation 
thats the policy 
hollywoods approach has been equally slow according to the 
guild american indians were cast in only 3 percent of last years 
film and television roles and 1 percent of tv commercials mitchell 
said producers dont object to lobbying for minority casting but 
dont necessarily cooperate either 
what we get are comments like well you know our casting 
practices are based upon first amendment protection you cant tell 
us how to cast a film he said 
hicks was pleased that powwow highway depicted indians 
without buckskins and feathers but does not expect hollywood to 
continue the reality 
they dont seem to let us get out of those stereotypes he 
said we would like to see indians playing doctors and lawyers and 
policeman these things are not going to change until we do our own 
productions

the only good indian is a dead indian 
such dialogue so odious by todays standards was common in 
western movies a few decades ago it stemmed from a remark 
attributed to gen philip h sheridan when he was introduced to a 
comanche chief in 1869 
me tochoway said the chief me good indian 
the only good indians i ever saw were dead snapped sheridan 
the attitude of the indian fighter was illustrated in countless 
movies from 1920 to 1960 with rare exceptions indians were 
portrayed as bloodthirsty savages who were a menace to white maidens 
and americas manifest destiny 
in the book the western george n fenin and william k 
everson observe that film audiences seldom saw depictions of the 
tragedy of the indian tribes pushed backwards and backwards again 
in violation of treaties and agreements their confinement to 
reservations where unscrupulous indian agents exploited them 
shamelessly the disintegration of their fighting spirit and their 
traditional desire to live in peace with the white man 
twas not always so earlier in the century movies often focused 
on the noble savage with depictions of james fennimore coopers 
stories the legends of hiawatha pocahontas ramona 
as westerns grew more epic in scope during the 1920s indians 
became ideal villains to maraud wagon trains battle the cavalry and 
menace the heroine with a fate worse than death such portrayals 
continued from silent films into the talkies 
john ford the greatest of western directors made consistent use 
of the indian menace in his 1924 classic the iron horse 
railroad builders were attacked by hordes of sioux pawnees and 
cheyennes the most memorable scene of the 1939 stagecoach was 
the pursuit of the travelers by the swiftracing indians 
fords depiction of redskin savages continued in fort 
apache 1948 she wore a yellow ribbon 1949 and rio 
grande 1950 
in the searchers 1956 natalie wood was a white captive who 
witnessed indian atrocities and was the wife of a comanche chief 
until rescued by john wayne 
in his last western cheyenne autumn 1964 ford seemed to 
seek expiation for his treatment of indians the film traced the 
bitter trek of cheyennes from a bleak reservation in oklahoma to 
their native land in the northwest critics called cheyenne 
autumn mawkish and deplored the indian cast of gilbert roland 
dolores del rio ricardo montalban victor jory and sal mineo 
such nonethnic castings were common throughout hollywood 
history among the whites who portrayed indians are anthony quinn 
the plainsman they died with their boots on rock hudson 
taza son of cochise howard keel the war wagon chuck 
connors geronimo linda darnell buffalo bill tony 
curtis the outsider julie newmar mckennas gold 
delmar daves broken arrow 1950 proved a watershed film in 
hollywoods attitude toward the indian james stewart played a scout 
who marries an indian woman and sympathizes with the apache plight 
seldom thereafter did filmmakers have the nerve to depict 
indians as if they were villains simply because they were red men 
writes brian garfield in western films 
despite the sympathetic view of broken arrow hollywood 
casting prevailed jeff chandler as cochise debra paget as the 
indian maid 
later years brought more films supporting the indians cause 
tell them willie boy is here 1969 an indianturnedcowboy 
deals with prejudice soldier blue 1970 about two white 
survivors of an indian attack who trek across the desert a man 
called horse 1970 richard harris tour de force as the white 
aristocrat who lives with indians and becomes their leader and 
little big man 1971 a white man dustin hoffman recounts his 
history with indians 
in the 1980s the western has virtually disappeared as a film 
genre but it still turns up on television which apparently has 
much to learn about the indian image 
two recent miniseries lonesome dove and around the world 
in 80 days portrayed indians in the appalling cliche of the 
savage devoted to killing as many whites as possible

salman rushdies the satanic verses went on 
sale a year ago and since then it has sold more than a million 
copies raised religious and political furor and sent the author 
into hiding from assassins 
he and his wife have split up and no end to his predicament is 
in sight 
the extraordinary furor that engulfed much of the world following 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death threat against the indianborn 
author has subsided to a degree and the international writing 
community is divided over whether it should go on speaking out in 
his behalf or fall silent in hopes that the threat will gradually 
evaporate 
three months after the publication of the novel on sept 26 
1988 khomeini ruled it was blasphemous and imposed a death sentence 
on the novelist himself a moslem and now a british subject and his 
publishers irans islamic fundamentalist leadership put a 52 
million price on rushdies head 
irans leaders say the death threat issued feb 14 still stands 
despite khomeinis death this past june rushdie who has spent 
seven months living in britishintelligence safe houses has vowed 
to continue writing while hoping for reconciliation 
in a poem in the september issue of the british literary magazine 
granta the 42yearold author wrote that he had chosen not to 
shut up to sing on in spite of attack 
the copyrighted 17line poem titled 6 march 1989 was 
written 20 days after khomeini issued his edict 
hes not free in a way a writer needs to be but some kind 
of commitment to the truth pushes him on said the british 
novelist ian mcewan nothing can stop him writing 
rushdie also has been doing occasional book reviews for the 
observer a british weekly newspaper most recently one published 
sept 10 of el doctorows billy bathgate a novel about the 
american gangster dutch schultz 
according to tariq ali a friend and fellow writer rushdie is 
not completely isolated 
in one sense he is an iranian hostage in england ali said 
in an interview he meets who he wants to meet within limits he 
talks to his friends but the tragedy is that he cannot live at home 
amongst his books his studies and his work 
his wife the american novelist marianne wiggins stopped living 
with him in july in what friends called a mutual breakup her 
publishers say only that she wants to be left alone and does not 
know where rushdie now lives 
ms wiggins who married rushdie in 1987 had given telephone 
interviews to british newspapers in which she said the couple had 
moved 56 times since police took them from their london home and put 
them into hiding 
she spoke of the paranoia and isolation of their lives where 
you can no longer pass down the street and encounter a stranger 
you lose all sense of spontaneity because you live in fear 
some writers think the campaign for rushdie should be kept on the 
boil while others say muting it would be in rushdies best interest 
in an interview novelist mcewan welcomed the dropoff in media 
coverage saying that at its height it made rushdie feel more 
hunted 
but hans erik matre chairman of the association of norwegian 
editors suggested that publicity gives him protection 
ali who says he is in regular contact with rushdie said 
clearly he wants the affair to end he doesnt want to do anything 
to provoke the fundamentalists but he wants people to speak up in 
his favor he knows perfectly whats at stake 
josephine pulleinthompson general secretary of the english 
chapter of the international writers group pen said we support 
rushdie to the hilt but theres no point in shouting about it its 
the madmen youre going to stir not the ordinary moslems in a way 
cooling it is a good thing 
the diplomatic fallout has largely settled as well nations of 
the european economic community joined by austria canada norway 
and sweden withdrew their envoys from iran in protest but nearly 
all returned them within weeks 
britain broke diplomatic relations with iran and the netherlands 
recalled its ambassador again in may when president ali khamenei of 
iran said a bullet was still waiting for rushdie 
militants among britains 2 million moslems have staged 
bookburning demonstrations in india and pakistan 26 people have 
died in antirushdie riots

in the west a thread of fear surfaces wherever the satanic 
verses is concerned 
university students in vienna austria planned a public reading 
but called it off after anonymous bomb threats were made in the 
french edition of the book the translators name is nowhere to be 
seen the west german edition was put out by a consortium of 90 
publishers to make it harder for terrorists to identify a target 
assassins killed the moderate imam or prayer leader of a mosque 
in belgium and his aide march 29 imam abdullah alahdal had 
criticized the death sentence imposed by khomeini 
on aug 3 a bomb killed a man in a london hotel and an islamic 
group claimed the man was preparing to use the bomb against rushdie 
on sept 13 a bomb caused minor damage at a bookstore owned by 
rushdies publisher the viking penguin group in york the store 
was closed at the time and there were no injuries another bomb was 
defused the same day at another viking penguin bookstore in 
guildford 
the office of the weekly newspaper the riverdale press in the 
bronx ny was firebombed feb 28 after publishing an editorial 
defending the satanic verses two bookstores in berkeley 
calif were firebombed the same day and five stores in london were 
bombed from april 9 to sept 3 in attacks that authorities said 
could be related to the book 
a dutch retail chain stopped selling the book aug 31 after 
receiving a threat and dozens of bookstores across westesn europe 
keep it under the counter or have refused to stock it 
islamic fundamentalists have said the death threat can be lifted 
only if rushdie admits he sinned and every copy of the book is 
burned rushdie apologized feb 18 for any offense to moslems but 
he refused to recant and it is clearly too late to withdraw the 
book 
it has been on bestseller lists in the united states since its 
publication and has gone into multiple printings there 
more than 11 million hardback copies have been sold worldwide 
including more than 600000 in the united states said sources at 
viking penguin and translations have been published or are 
appearing soon in nine european countries 
the uproar has made it book of the year said remo croce 
president of italys booksellers association in france it is 
publisher christian bourgois biggest commercial success said an 
aide 
in britain the novel has been on bestseller lists for eight 
months and anticensorship groups are anxious to see it in 
paperback 
if the paperback does not come out that is creeping 
censorship said frances dsouza director of article 19 a 
londonbased freespeech organization that has collected 12000 
signatures worldwide many from major writers on a petition for 
rushdie 
but kalim siddiqui director of the moslem institute in london 
said there will be no letup in the campaign against the book 
rushdie will serve a very long life sentence protected by the 
british government he said in an interview his own plight is a 
very small part of the total misery he has caused 
the 46nation organization of islamic conference has banned the 
book along with india south africa and kenya libya was the only 
conference member that unequivocally supported khomeinis death 
threat the others said rushdie should first be tried by an islamic 
court 
islamic leaders say the affair has worsened the alienation of 
western europes 5 million moslems firebombs have been thrown at 
two mosques in england and ugly rumblings have come from the 
european far right demanding the expulsion of moslems 
rushdie has given no interviews friends say he is coping well 
despite the breakup of his marriage and is writing a childrens book 
intellectually he is in good spirits said ali he is not 
cowed by the fundamentalists come what may his book will haunt 
the islamic world forever

it says something about the book put out by 
william ferris and charles wilson that the major complaint from 
readers is that it is too heavy to read in bed most people dont 
take an encylcopedia to bed 
it says something too about the eightpound threeounce 
encyclopedia of southern culture that not many people except for the 
citizens of fort worth texas have found much that was left out 
fort worth complains because it didnt get an entry of its own 
making it appear perhaps less southern than dallas or new orleans 
this massive and ambitious 50 1600page compendium of the 
cultural landscape of the south exploring everything from johnny 
cash to moon pies was published this summer 
even before it came out the fort worth startelegram carried a 
piece offering a carload of mint juleps if the book would just 
include fort worth 
it was a very attractive offer says ferris son of a soybean 
farmer now director of the center for the study of southern culture 
at the university of mississippi but in defining what constitutes 
dixie we had to draw the line somewhere and we basically drew it 
between fort worth and dallas 
as for the rest of the south and its institutions folkways 
foods burdens icons topics attitudes crops and hangups to my 
knowledge there have been no real omissions says ferris 
which says a lot 
edited jointly by ferris a folklorist and charles wilson a 
historian and 10 years in the works it was supposed to have taken 
four the encyclopedia has 800 contributors including novelists 
theologians lawyers psychologists historians sociologists 
theyre specialists on everything from the role violence race 
and religion have played on the psyche of the south to the history 
of the goo goo cluster the souths favorite candy it got its 
name legend says from the first utterance of the infant son of its 
creator william h campbell in 1912 
the encyclopedia offers billy carters distinction between a good 
old boy and a redneck the former rides around in a pickup drinking 
beer and puts his empties in a sack the latter rides around in a 
pickup drinking beer and tossing his empties out the window 
ferris says the criticism hes heard most often from readers 
concerned the books size but some critics have complained about 
imbalance reviewer jonathan yardley felt there was too much henry 
aaron too little willie mays too much vivian leigh not enough 
clark gable 
john egerton author of southern food at home on the road in 
history complained he couldnt find entries on andrew johnson 
earl long happy chandler larry mcmurtry or minnie pearl and not 
enough on southern politics and rivers 
never mind the book still swarms with the stuff that makes the 
south distinctive 
the flavor is conveyed by just a smattering from the a b and c 
entries in the index 
a 
air conditioning ask any southerner over 30 years of age to 
explain why the south has changed in recent decades and he may

a decision to rebuild us food aid reserves by 
offering farmers the option of planting additional wheat for the 
1990 harvest comes as global donations to hungry nations are the 
smallest in six years 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced last week that 
wheat farmers may if they choose boost plantings for 1990 farmers 
now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of their wheat 
base acreage up to a limit of 105 percent 
this action is necessary to maintain our humanitarian food aid 
commitments while adding slightly to us carryover supplies 
following two consecutive years of drought yeutter said 
department analysts estimated that the option will boost the 1990 
wheat acreage for harvest by about 21 million acres to 696 
million total wheat production could rise by 66 million bushels to 
a projected 2596 billion bushels next year 
an increase of 66 million bushels due to yeutters decision would 
be equal to 18 million metric tons which would approximately 
offset the 15 million tons of wheat authorized by the reagan 
administration to be released for donations as humanitarian food aid 
but yeutter said an additional 2 million metric tons has been 
requested for the 1990 fiscal year that will begin on oct 1 
the wheat is part of a special reserve of 4 million tons 
established by congress in 1980 to help meet global emergency food 
demands it had not been tapped until president reagan cleared the 
way last october 
according to agriculture department analysts tight grain 
supplies and higher prices have put financial pressure on donor 
nations 
the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates 
world cereal aid shipments in the 198889 trade year that ended june 
30 dropped to below 98 million tons the smallest amount since 
198384 
a report by the departments economic research service said the 
198889 shipments were down 25 percent from the previous year the 
sharpest oneyear decline in 15 years even so they were still 
above the levels of shipments in the early 1980s 
according to the estimates 198889 was the first time in four 
years that cereal aid shipments fell below the 1974 world food 
conference target of 10 million tons the report said given 
continuing tight world supplies cereal aid shipments likely will 
decline again in 198990 
cereals mostly wheat make up the overwhelming volume of world 
food aid the report said the united states is the biggest donor 
accounting for 56 percent of last years food aid total others 
include the european economic community 20 percent canada 10 
percent japan 4 percent and austalia 3 percent 
analysts said that some buildup in wheat stockpiles may be on the 
horizon with improved weather conditions and larger plantings 
two years of stronger prices could boost foreign exporter 
plantings and production the report said these gains should 
mean that exporters will begin rebuilding stocks that prices will 
weaken and that food aid budgets will permit a somewhat larger 
volume of shipments 
but it cautioned that world demand for grain continues to grow 
and that the rebuilding process will be gradual 
in the near term the world will have only a small cushion 
against a major production shock that could send prices up 
sharply the report said

general motors corps lakewood ga assembly 
plant will close in midmarch and production of the cars made there 
will shift to other plants the company said thursday 
the united auto workers union swiftly criticized the decision 
saying it sends a message of defeat and a message of failure in 
gmuaw relations 
the plant employs about 2200 people 250 of whom are salaried 
about 1000 of the employees are on indefinite layoff a gm 
statement said provisions are being made to ensure they get all the

the lakewood plant makes the chevrolet caprice and the buick

built beyond midmarch but he couldnt say where 
general motors management is not trying nearly hard enough to 
fulfill its obligations under the national agreement and to source 
offshore production back into domestic plants if necessary to 
maintain employment here said uaw vice president stephen yokich 
in charge of the unions gm department 
theres still time for gm to demonstrate that it truly wants a 
new relationship with the union and union workers yokich said in 
an apparent reference to negotiations which will begin next summer 
the uawgm national contract expires exactly a year after gms 
announcement thursday 
gm began producing cars at the plant in atlanta in 1929 gm would 
not comment on the production rate but a study of automotive

capacity of 145000 cars a year at a line rate of 3775 an hour on

the volume of world merchandise trade is expected 
to increase by about 7 percent in 1989 and growth will likely remain 
strong in the next few years the organization that sponsors 
tradeliberalizing agreements said today 
in an optimistic report the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade said technological progress the fall in the price of oil and 
new national economic policies were among factors behind 
unexpectedly high recent growth in international commerce 
it said trade in services such as tourism and banking had grown 
even faster than merchandise trade during the 1980s and reached an 
estimated value of about 560 billion last year 
merchandise exports were worth an estimated 288 trillion in 
1988 145 percent higher than the previous year the volume of 
goods traded increased by 85 percent a record for the 1980s the 
report said 
despite the expansion in world trade many third world countries 
suffered a drop in export earnings during the decade the report 
said 
it warned that the worlds poorest countries can no longer rely 
on exports of commodities which account for threequarters of their 
foreign exchange to fuel economic growth 
examining the reasons for the expansion of international 
commerce gatt said one factor was technological innovations that 
have increased the scope of goods and services that can be traded on 
world markets 
the halving of the price of oil since the 1980 peak the rising 
share of manufactured products in trade and the increase in the 
number of international mergers were also responsible the report 
said 
economic reforms in the soviet union and china relatively low 
inflation in western countries deregulation of business and freeing 
of capital movements further combined to boost world trade and open 
up international markets the report said 
in the longer term gatt predicted the world economy may have 
entered a period in which the average growth rates for output and 
trade will be higher than they have been since the onset of 
economic difficulties in the late 1960s and the early 1970s 
gatt spokesman david woods said this forecast covered the next 
five to 10 years 
the 97 nations that belong to the trade forum account for over 
fourfifths of world trade bolivia became a member of gatt last 
month

five activists chained themselves to a banister 
at the new york stock exchange to protest the high cost of azt a 
drug used to treat aids 
three of the five members of the aids coalition to unleash 
power were described as having aids or aidsrelated complex 
according to sharon gamsin vice president for media relations at 
the exchange the incident occurred at the start of trading 
thursday 930 am 
the five dressed as floor traders and wearing fake brokerage 
firm ids chained themselves to a banister of a balcony overlooking 
the exchange floor 
there they unfurled a banner that read sell wellcome a 
reference to burroughs wellcome manufacturer of azt and set off 
miniature fog horns 
ms gamsin said the five were removed by guards and turned over 
to police we will file charges against them she said 
she noted that burroughs wellcome is traded over the counter not 
on the new york stock exchange 
federal studies have found that azt is effective in slowing the 
course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome but it costs 8000 
to 10000 a year 
burroughs wellcome is the sole manufacturer of the drug and 
company officials have said the high price is necessary to pay for 
manufacturing and for research

ford motor co says it will move production of its

kentucky truck plant near louisville 
the company also said thursday it plans to spend three times as 
much on its north american heavytruck business over the next five 
years than it did in the previous five years 
spokesman dw haines said the company would provide no figures 
because of competitive reasons 
edward hagenlocker a vice president and general manager of ford 
truck operations made the announcements at the north american ford 
heavy truck annual dealer meeting in vancouver british columbia 
according to a news release received in detroit 
he said production of the cargo trucks at the kentucky truck 
plant would start in the last three months of next year the company 
said it would continue its current production at the plant along 
with cargo production bringing total production to about 70000 
vehicles a year 
the 2000employee work force will not change with the addition 
of the cargo trucks haines said 
cargo line trucks also are made in australia and the united 
kingdom but none of their production is for the us market

the house ways and means committee has agreed 
to legislation that would siphon off 43 billion over five years 
from profits of companies making ozonedepleting chemicals 
the provision approved thursday was added to a tax and 
entitlement bill 
the bush administration has sought such a revenueraising measure 
because it targets windfall profits that chemical firms could earn 
after an international treaty reduces supplies of 
chlorofluorocarbons 
the socalled cfcs destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere 
and increase the risk of skin cancer there is similar language 
pending before the senate 
the proposal which the ways and means panel labels a tax on 
ozonedepleting chemicals would bring in an estimated 362 
million in the 1990 fiscal year while revenues in the following 
four years were put respectively at 614 million 753 million 
11 billion and 14 billion the tax would become effective jan 1 
the chemical industry denies there will be windfall profits after 
the united states begins implementing the montreal protocol a 1987 
international agreement to cut production of cfcs 
the theory behind the tax is that demand will far outstrip supply 
once production is frozen at 1986 levels the protocol requires that 
by 1998 production can be only 50 percent of the 1986 figures 
the five manufacturers of cfcs are developing substitutes but 
they are reportedly three to five years away from production

us business leaders have called on congress 
and the bush administration to end what the group charged was a 
budget charade and begin work on a realistic effort to cut the 
federal deficit 
the committee for economic development composed of executives 
from some of the countrys top corporations issued a report 
thursday that charged that the bipartisan budget agreement between 
president bush and congress dodged the important budgetary issues 
and made little substantive and lasting improvement in the outlook 
for the deficit 
that agreement covering the fiscal year which begins oct 1 is 
designed to meet the legal target of reducing the budget deficit 
from an expected 150 billion this year down to 100 billion in 1990 
but the committees report charged that more than onethird of 
the projected savings in the bipartisan agreement were composed of 
onetime savings accounting gimmicks and other smoke and mirrors 
that merely improve the appearances of the budget 
the report titled battling americas budget deficits also 
called for trimming social security and medicare saying that 
significant deficit reductions could not be made unless these huge 
middleclass entitlement programs were scaled back 
roy ash head of the office of management and budget in the nixon 
administration and a member of the panel which prepared the ced 
report said that official washington was currently obfuscating 
misleading and deceiving the public about the deficit crisis 
facing the country 
the committee proposed a program to trim the deficit by 40 
billion to 50 billion each year through a combination of budget 
cuts and unspecified tax hikes members of the group said they took 
no stand on which taxes to increase because they could not reach 
consensus although some said they favored creation of a 
consumptionbased tax such as the value added tax used by many 
european nations 
the recommendations of the group were being presented to omb 
director richard darman and congressional budget leaders according 
to robert holland president of the ced and a former member of the 
federal reserve board 
holland complained that the countrys deficit woes were not as 
dominant in the news currently as they were a few years ago even 
though the problem is far from being solved 
the deficit problem today rarely makes front page news he 
said the result is that few people care deeply about the issue 
and our political system feels little pressure to tackle it 
effectively

group composed of 250 business and education leaders

the lawn and garden industry has to be 
nimble to deal with fickle weather drought last year wilted 
national sales 11 percent to 155 billion but retailers are 
poised for fast growth in the 1990s experts say 
in trendsetting california lawn and garden sales grew 9 percent 
to 38 billion in 1988 and part of the reason was a switch by 
homeowners to plants and irrigation systems that use less water 
weather is the primary factor that affects this industry and 
its something the industry has no control over said charles w 
dunn founder of the garden center institute in atlanta during a 
visit to the huge pacific horticultural trade show here 
rain drenched the southeast and east this summer and hurt 
sales but there are some shifts occurring out there in the 
marketplace and the future looks bright dunn said 
the baby boom generation he said is probably the best 
segment of the marketplace out there for gardening and its going 
to drive this industry into the 1990s along with the 5050 
generation people who are 50 years old and have a 50000plus 
annual income 
as the baby boomers approaching or just over 40 become more 
established in homes they are spending more money to spruce up 
gardens and lawns for both enjoyment and investment 
we did a nationwide study and found new homeowners felt that a 
welllandscaped home could add up to 15 percent of real estate 
value dunn said it was as good or better investment as 
remodeling the kitchen or bath when it came time to sell that home 
limited garden space and a new influx of immigrants also are 
having an impact on garden suppliers the nursery of the 90s is 
likely to sell more container plants dwarf trees and fruit trees 
popular in asia and the middle east 
were selling more dwarf citrus trees which dont take up as 
much space and bear a manageable amount of fruit for todays 
smaller family said don dillon jr of four winds nursery in 
fremont 
garden suppliers dunn said report four types of landscapes 
increasingly being installed at american homes 
an area for public view that looks good but requires low 
maintenance 
a grassy play area for children with less emphasis on flowers 
an entertainment area with movable furniture 
the garden retreat where people can sit and read or just get 
away from it all integrating water flowers rocks bridges and 
exotic furniture 
but no matter which landscape is selected thought has to be 
given to water use and cyclical bouts of heat and drought 
gardening tips being distributed at many retail nurseries teach 
homeowners how to conserve water and maintain landscapes through 
proper design grouping of plant material correct planting methods 
and mulching as well as watersaving practices 
among the products on display at the pacific horticultural trade 
show are several that save water crystals that hold water like tiny 
reservoirs around the roots of plants root sponges that reduce 
watering after transplanting drip irrigation systems and planters 
that have builtin reservoirs and moisture control sensors that turn 
the watering function on and off as needed

the battered junk bond market is anxiously 
waiting to see whether campeau corp can snatch its prime retail 
operations from the precipice of default 
campeaus federated department stores inc is scheduled to make a 
loan payment today reported to be in the 50 million range but 
campeau needs an outside infusion of cash to prevent a default 
in the junk bond market where trading of the highyield 
highrisk securities took a gutwrenching hit earlier this week 
everybody is looking to see how campeau gets out of this mess 
because it could have a big effect on everything said john moran 
a trader at advest inc 
admissions that both federated and campeaus allied stores corp 
units could default on their debt payments triggered a broad junk 
bond selloff earlier this week that spread to issues regarded as 
among the most stable and attractive 
critics have long contended that junk bonds typically used to 
finance expensive highly leveraged takeovers were ripe for a fall 
the thinking goes that companies would default on interest payments 
either because they would be unable to sell divisions at the heady 
prices they anticipated or because cash flows would not live up to 
expectations 
robert campeau head of the torontobased real estate and retail 
concern was scrambling to line up financing from olympia amp york 
developments ltd to pay the debt 
any success in getting more financing for allied and federated 
which are in dire need of credit so they can stock up on inventory 
ahead of the christmas shopping season would help not only to prop 
up those precarious issues but the junk market in general 
traders fear that if the market is widely perceived as too risky 
and unstable investors will dump their holdings 
if too many people start jumping on the band wagon the 
junkbond mutual fund managers are not going to have enough cash 
to cover redemptions and theyre going to be forced to blow out of 
their positions one observer said 
so far traders said they had not detected any significant selling 
by mutual funds that invest in junk bonds 
moran said managers are studying the situation and are not 
likely to act hastily besides the whole thing is up in the 
air he said noting that campeau could succeed in its 
restructuring plans 
while some market experts said this weeks selloff was 
particularly significant because more stable attractive issues fell 
in tandem with distressed bonds others contend the downturn was due 
robert levine president of kidder peabody high yield asset 
management characterized the decline as more of a technical 
correction because prices had been on the upswing recently 
furthermore there has been no change in the credit quality of most 
companies he said 
yields quoted on some allied and federated issues have soared 
well above 25 percent to compensate for heightened risk 
but said anthony naylor a senior vice president at rodman amp 
renshaw inc when a bond is trading at a 25 percent yield it 
means theyre not going to pay 
campeau used billions of dollars from the sale of junk bonds to 
finance its 88 billion takeover of federated last year not only 
did he pay top dollar for the retail company but a stagnant 
consumer market dashed his plans for relying on cash flow to pay 
down the debt 
last week campeau put its flagship bloomingdales department 
store chain on the auction block in an effort to raise cash

michael milkens lawyers say they arent picking 
a fight with the press in an attempt to squelch alleged leaks by 
government prosecutors in the highly publicized securities fraud and 
racketeering case 
in court papers filed this week lawyers for the former drexel 
burnham lambert inc highyield bond division leader claim that a 
constant stream of press leaks is threatening milkens right to a 
fair trial 
the motion asks us district judge kimba wood to order the 
government to stop leaking confidential material hold a hearing to 
identify the sources of the leaks punish the leakers and make 
public a confidential securities and exchange commission memo 
written about in the washington post 
no members of the media would be called at any hearing on the 
motion because we are not interested in confrontations with the 
press the motion adds 
the lawyers claim the government has turned confidential grand 
jury proceedings into a spectator sport by releasing information 
about the milken probe repeatedly over the last three years to 
pressure witnesses and other possible targets to cooperate 
the motion filed wednesday in federal court in manhattan claims 
the alleged leaking flatly violates federal criminal regulations 
and other legal and ethical rules requiring confidentiality in 
government investigations 
we are asking the court to stop the government from continuing 
its leaking and to punish those government officials responsible 
martin flumenbaum a lawyer for milken said thursday 
a hearing to ferret out media leaks would not be unprecedented 
the motion cites the 1980 bank fraud case of former carter 
administration budget director bert lance in which a federal 
appeals court ordered such a hearing 
though the milken motion seeks to exclude reporters motions 
like this have the potential for leading to first amendment 
confrontations with the press according to one prominent first 
amendment attorney who asked not to be identified 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg were charged march 29 in a 98count fraud and racketeering 
indictment that alleges insider trading securities law violations 
and other crimes in the broadest action of the governments wall 
street crackdown they pleaded innocent and a march 1990 trial is 
set 
milken was first named in news reports as the governments main

richard c breeden president bushs choice for 
chairman of the securities and exchange commission pledges to crack 
down hard on inside traders but says his no 1 problem is improving 
the pay of the agencys staff 
the nominee told senators at his confirmation hearing thursday 
that he would absolutely continue the secs current efforts to 
root fraud out of the securities markets 
but breeden also said pay increases for sec staffers were 
necessary to attract new talent and cut the agencys high turnover 
rate 
i dont know of any single issue facing the commission today 
that is more important than our ability to maintain the caliber and 
the quality of the staff breeden said 
the starting salary for an sec staff attorney is 27130 well 
below what a top law school graduate can make at a wall street law 
firm sec officials said 
in a morninglong hearing before the senate banking housing and 
urban affairs committee breeden who once headed a task force on 
deregulation of the financial industry said he believed in free 
competitive markets 
but he added free markets dont work if investors or 
participants believe they are dominated by fraud or corruption 
the committee will decide if breedens nomination should be 
recommended to the full senate 
i think you can do an exceptional job but it wont be easy 
said committee chairman donald w riegle dmich adding that he 
intended to vote for breedens confirmation 
after the hearing riegle told reporters he expected a 
confirmation vote would come in a few days 
riegle noted breeden still had to supply detailed answers to 
written questions posed by the committee staff 
breeden a white house aide who helped write the legislation to 
bail out the nations savings and loan industry was tapped by bush 
for the sec post last month 
at the time riegle and other senators expressed skepticism about 
the banking lawyers experience in the securities industry 
but the promised public grilling of the nominee never 
materialized apparently due to breedens impressive performance in 
private meetings with committee members earlier this week 
several senators remarked about those private meetings in 
praising breedens intelligence and candor during the hearing 
breeden told sen christopher dodd dconn that its a 
perfectly legitimate role of government to keep the markets clean 
he said that would restore individual investors confidence in the 
markets and attract foreign investment 
when riegle expressed hope that wrongdoers would find breeden a 
fair but tough cop on the beat breeden replied certainly if 
i am fortunate enough to be confirmed under my leadership that will 
be the case 
breeden appeared relaxed but cautious as he answered committee 
members questions constantly asserting that his views were his own 
and he couldnt speak for the sec 
he said the 200 billion junk bond market is worth the careful 
attention of the commission although he was not suggesting 
theres any particular problem in the market today 
breeden also said he didnt think the sec had been 
overzealous in its pursuit of insider trading and said the 
charges against the investment banking giant drexel burnham lambert 
inc were for more than harmless technical problems 
he said the sec and the rival commodity futures trading 
commission should remain separate agencies and called for a better 
working relationship including staff exchanges with the cftc 
which has disputed the sec jurisdiction over some new financial 
instruments that have elements of both securities and futures 
contracts

cadillac should hang on to its share 
of the luxury car market in 1990 despite the entry of two japanese 
luxury car lines this year the divisions general manager says 
john grettenberger also said thursday that the popularity of 
nissans infiniti line and toyotas lexus cars would be watched 
closely by cadillac officials 
lexus cars officially went on sale sept 1 but some had been 
sold before they arrived in showrooms infinitis two models go on 
sale nov 8 
were not taking it lightly at all grettenberger said during 
cadillacs 1990 introduction im not surprised that cadillac 
owners are susceptible 
a survey by thomas ogrady of integrated automotive resources 
inc in wayne pa showed that of 200 people who bought lexus cars 
during the first month of sale 122 percent of them traded in 
cadillacs and 61 percent switched from lincolns 
early predictions by lexus officials forecast that about 10 
percent of the cars traded in on their two models would be cadillacs 
or lincolns many more people would trade in european luxury cars 
including mercedes and bmw and others would step up to lexus from 
other toyotamade cars they said 
infinitis two cars will be in about 50 infiniti dealers on nov 
8 dave hubbard infinitis national advertising director said 
thursday the division had not predicted the kinds of cars that would 
be traded in 
however he added infiniti had a longrange goal of capturing 
buyers moving into the luxury segment for the first time 
grettenberger said it was understandable that a large percentage 
of tradeins would be cadillacs since cadillac is the largest player 
in the luxury car market holding about 268 percent of it 
theres no question that the newest products from japan will 
represent formidable competition grettenberger said 
cadillacs base prices for 1990 range from 26960 to 36980 
with the allantes prices at 50900 for the new convertibleonly 
version at 50900 and 56533 for the model with a removable 
hardtop the same price as last year 
lexus two cars carry base prices of 21050 and 35000 and 
infiniti cars cost 23500 and 38000 
theyve done a very good job of preparing the market for the 
car grettenberger said of lexus it will be interesting to see 
if they can maintain this level over the next couple of months 
lexus has forecast annual sales of about 75000 cars about 
onefourth cadillacs prediction hubbard said infiniti would make 
no sales projections for the first year 
grettenberger said he expected cadillac to continue to command 
the lions share of the luxury car market holding on to its 268 
percent share 
asked where lexus and infiniti would get their buyers 
grettenberger said they most likely would come from the european 
makers 
luxury car buyers like to buy new things he said 
for 1990 cadillac has kept the basic exterior designs of its 
entire line it is introducing the convertible allante adding a 
traction control system for the twoseater 
it also is putting more powerful engines in the de ville 
fleetwood seville and eldorado models in addition cadillac is 
making other changes in all its cars none of which will affect how 
the vehicles look

the pentagons chief supplier of hydraulic 
aircraft landing gear has agreed to repay the government about 14 
million in contract overcharges for the air forces largest 
transport plane 
the government claimed that labor charges on a 67 million 
contract were twice as high as original estimates by the company 
curtisswright of ridgefield nj said us attorney samuel a 
alito jr 
the contract was for 60 spare landing gear actuators that control 
landing gear flaps and other moveable exterior systems on the air 
forces lockheed c5a galaxy 
alito said the companys failure to provide air force auditors 
with labor standards and data on the companys internal cost 
estimates led to a gross inflation of the labor costs 
curtisswright has denied any wrongdoing attempts to reach 
corporate officials after the settlement was announced thursday 
evening were unsuccessful and the switchboard at the companys 
headquarters was closed 
the government contends curtisswrights contract was based on a 
company estimate of 46000 labor hours for the contract alito said 
investigators found the contract was completed in 23000 hours 
the companys failure to live up to its certification with 
respect to the c5a flight actuators subjected it to civil 
liability alito said in a statement 
under the false claims act a civil warera statute aimed at 
wartime profiteers the government can demand reimbursement when it 
can prove a contractor was not negotiated in good faith the act was 
further bolstered in 1986 by amendments that allow the government to 
claim triple damages and apply large fines 
alito said the claims were not part of criminal or civil court 
proceedings but were the result of a preliminary investigation by 
his office and the defense criminal investigative service an arm of 
the us defense department

bell atlantic corp has launched a 
restructuring program that will trim as many as 1200 managers from 
the workforce despite years of steady profit growth 
the regional telephone company announced thursday it would offer 
early retirement incentives aimed at cutting 1000 to 1200 managers 
and said it is also considering several financial moves such as 
refinancing some debts and revaluing spare parts inventories 
the reorganization will lead to the companys first quarterly 
drop in profit since it was created in 1984 by the breakup of 
american telephone and telegraph co 
bell atlantic will break even or make a small profit in the 
fourth quarter officials said for the same period last year the 
company made 153 per share 
in the second quarter of this year the companys net income rose 
49 percent to 3608 million or 184 per share 
we think the time to change is when youre doing well said 
dennis mollura bell atlantic spokesman if you wait until things 
go bad its too late 
in a very real sense we are laying the groundwork for the bell 
atlantic of the future raymond w smith bell atlantics chairman 
and chief executive said in a news release 
managers will be offered cash incentives and pension benefits to 
retire early the company said 
the company will eliminate one level of management based in 
washington overseeing the chesapeake and potomac telephone 
companies in maryland virginia west virginia and washington the 
four telephone companies will report directly to anton j

several internal operations such as office planning the motor 
pool real estate management and administrative services will be 
centralized

last major reorganization for the foreseeable future campanella 
said 
the company is considering seeking lower interest rates on debts 
owed by chesapeake and potomac telephone companies in maryland and 
west virginia and by diamond state telephone in delaware 
other possible moves include revaluations of spare parts in its 
computer maintenance business and reducing the book value of its 
assets of smaller subsidiaries 
the moves would decrease earnings in one quarter but give a 
slight lift to earnings in 1990 said philip a campbell bell 
atlantic chief financial officer 
pitt said the recent threeweek strike by members of the 
communications workers of america and the international brotherhood 
of electrical workers against bell atlantic played no part in the 
restructuring decision or its timing

texas attorney general jim mattox usurped federal 
authority and picked on quaker oats co by suing it for false 
advertising according to the cereal makers countersuit against the 
state 
the quaker suit filed a week after mattox sued the chicagobased 
company accuses the attorney general and texas health commissioner 
robert bernstein of violating quakers rights to freedom of speech 
and equal protection under the law 
mattox claimed the countrys no1 maker of hot cereal misleads 
consumers through advertising claims that its product can help 
reduce the risk of heart disease by helping lower cholesterol 
quakers suit filed thursday asks a federal judge to declare 
quakers advertising truthful and to prevent mattox from interfering 
it also asks for unspecified damages noting quakers name has 
come to be recognized by consumers as signifying wholesome and 
nutritious food products and is accorded very high consumer loyalty 
and brand recognition 
mattoxs suit originally filed in state district court was 
switched to federal court with the filing of quakers suit 
it doesnt matter to us whether we win this case in state court 
or federal court said mattox spokesman ron dusek in austin it 
doesnt matter if they countersue or shoot off a cannon were 
going to prove that they illegally misrepresented their product in 
their advertising 
the quaker suit claims mattoxs action violates federal antitrust 
laws places unlawful restraints on interstate commerce and puts 
quaker at a competitive disadvantage 
there are several competitors of quaker oats both national and 
regional that are selling food products containing oats or oat bran 
and who are making similar or stronger claims for their products 
quaker vice president luther c mckinney said yet the attorney 
general has selectively challenged only quaker oats advertising 
the quaker suit also cites examples of several studies indicating 
bran is effective in reducing serum cholesterol thereby reducing 
the risk of heart attack 
since last week quaker has repeatedly noted that its ads were 
approved by the federal trade commission 
but dusek said lax regulation and protection of consumers is 
why the states took it upon themselves to form task forces to 
deal with problems that the federal government has decided it 
doesnt want to deal with 
texas has led nine other states in policing truthinadvertising 
and other consumer protection areas 
other targets have included sara lee corp chrysler corp and 
carnation co all of which deny they have used misleading 
advertising or violated consumer protection laws 
quakers suit also attacks this coalition claiming it is an 
unconstitutional compact among states and promotes the 
political ambitions of the attorneys general by publicizing their 
actions

mitsubishi bank ltd next week will become the first japanese 
bank to be listed on the new york stock exchange and also will rank 
as the largest foreign company traded on the big board published 
reports said friday 
mitsubishi the worlds fourthlargest bank will be the ninth 
japanese company to be listed on the nyse according to the new york 
times 
american investors will be allowed to trade more than two billion 
mitsubishi shares which initially will trade in the form of 
american depository receipts the paper said 
the move marks the first attempt by a japanese bank to raise 
money in the american capital markets which some wall street 
observers have predicted would be a growing trend the paper said 
the major japanese banks are under pressure to raise 35 billion 
over the next four years in order to comply with new capital 
requirements that the worlds leading central banks have set for 
international banks 
the times noted that japanese banks had not been expected to 
resort to the new york stock exchange to raise capital because they 
would have to meet securities and exchange commission disclosure 
requirements as well as alter their accounting practices but 
mitsubishi has met the requirements 
in tokyo the economic newspaper nihon keizai shimbun said the 
listing would be made on sept 19 
established in 1919 mitsubishi had assets totalling about 3432 
billion and net income of 115 billion for the fiscal year ended 
march 31 according to a company report

anheuserbusch cos inc has emerged as the 
most likely buyer of harcourt brace jovanovich incs theme parks as 
talks intensified between the two companies this week according to 
news reports 
hbj has been negotiating with the giant brewing company to accept 
hbjs chief executive officer ralph d caulo to run the parks but 
anheuserbusch wants to install its own chief executive a source 
close to the deal told the orlando sentinel for todays editions 
the problem is that anheuserbusch doesnt want him said 
ivan obolensky an analyst with josephthal amp co a new york 
brokerage obolensky said caulos background is in publishing hbjs 
key business and not in theme parks 
business week magazine reports in its sept 25 issue that 
anheuserbusch earlier this month began preparing a second round of 
bids for harcourts theme parks which it said are expected to fetch 
from 12 billion to 2 billion 
talks between orlandobased hbj and st louisbased 
anheuserbusch have reached a higher level of intensity in the past 
few days the orlando sentinel said 
hbj has said it hopes to complete a sale of its parks by the end 
of september 
on june 20 hbj said it would sell its six theme parks including 
sea worlds in orlando fla san diego san antonio and aurora 
ohio cypress gardens in winter haven fla and boardwalk and 
baseball near haines city fla 
the parks employ more than 7000 people during the peak summer 
months and fulltime employment yearround is nearly 3500 
analysts say companies reported to have bid for the theme parks 
include walt disney co mca inc florida leisure acquisition 
corp which owns the silver springs attraction near ocala and 
wesray capital corp of morristown nj which owns 80 percent of 
six flags corp 
also a group of three former hbj and sea world executives have 
said they made a bid for the parks 
hbj wants to sell the parks to pay off some of the 29 billion 
in debt that it acquired in warding off a bitter takeover attempt by 
british publisher robert maxwell in 1987 
elizabeth bramwell an analyst for gabelli amp co a new york 
brokerage said she is not aware that an agreement between hbj and 
anheuserbusch is imminent but it would be a strategically 
brilliant move for anheuserbusch i think it would be a very good 
fit 
anheuserbusch the nations largest brewer with wellknown 
brands including budweiser bud light and michelob is also a 
successful operator of the busch gardens theme parks 
anheuserbusch spokeswoman robyn meyer would not comment on 
reports that a deal between hbj and anheuserbusch is near 
margaret mary mcquillan senior vice president and spokeswoman 
for hbj said she had no information about a deal between 
anheuserbusch and hbj adding that there is nothing to report 
hbjs stock fell 12 cents a share thursday to close at 1587 
on the new york stock exchange 
hbj wants caulo to work for the parks buyer because william 
jovanovich hbjs ironwilled and autocratic chairman eventually 
wants to put his son peter at the companys helm a source close 
to the discussions told the sentinel 
caulo 54 outranks peter jovanovich 40 who is an executive 
vice president but caulo is outranked by william jovanovich 69 
a secretary in caulos office said he was not available for 
comment

wholesale prices fell for the third consecutive 
month in august as a big drop in energy costs pushed inflation down 
by 04 percent the government said today 
the decline in the labor departments producer price index 
followed a similar 04 percent plunge in july and a 01 percent dip 
in june it was the first time wholesale prices have fallen for 
three consecutive months since early 1986 
the august price moderation was even better than had been 
expected and provided further evidence to support arguments that 
inflation should be well under control in the second half of the 
year 
in other good economics news today the government reported that 
the us trade deficit narrowed for the second straight month in 
july falling to 758 billion the smallest gap since december 1984 
the 53 percent decline in the merchandise trade figure from june 
was a pleasant surprise to economists who had been fearing a sharp 
jump in the imbalance between exports and imports 
in another report the federal reserve said output at the 
nations factories mines and utilities rose 03 percent in august 
it was the biggest increase since a 07 percent rise in april and 
was credited to a rebound in production at auto factories and a 
pickup in coal mining following a strike 
the threemonth string of declines in wholesale prices was 
particularly welcome because it came after a surge in prices earlier 
this year had triggered fears of a possible inflationary spiral 
wholesale prices were surging ahead at an annual rate of 94 
percent through may however with the monthly declines since that 
time wholesale inflation is now running at a much more moderate 
annual rate of 44 percent through the first eight months of the 
year in 1988 wholesale prices rose 4 percent 
a broadbased drop in energy costs was credited for the price 
decline in august 
gasoline prices plunged 121 percent the third consecutive 
monthly decline prices of natural gas were also down dropping 5 
percent while prices of home heating oil fell 21 percent 
food costs were not as wellcontrolled posting a 03 percent 
increase as the costs of beef dairy products and bakery goods 
accelerated the price of eggs and pork rose in august after having 
fallen in july 
inflation excluding the food and energy categories was up 05 
percent reflecting in part higher prices for new cars many 
economists look to price increases of other goods as a better 
indicator of the underlying inflation rate because food and energy 
costs are more volatile from month to month 
the junejulyaugust declines marked the first consecutive 
monthly drops in the producer price index since a fourmonth period 
of falling wholesale prices from january through april in 1986 
the improvement in august left the ppi at 1133 meaning that a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 
11330 in august unlike the other figures in the report this one 
is not adjusted for normal seasonal variations 
economists had worried that higher food and energy costs were 
threatening to become imbedded in permanently higher inflation rates 
as workers demanded higher wage increases to make up for the ground 
lost to rising prices 
that also was a concern at the federal reserve which began 
moving in march 1988 to push interest rates up in an effort to 
dampen inflationary pressures 
the feds goal was to slow economic growth enough to allow 
inflation to moderate without pushing the country into a recession 
in june of this year the fed switched course and began lowering 
interest rates because of signs the economy might be slowing too 
much 
many economists believe the feds delicate balancing act has 
worked and inflation will remain moderate in the second half of the 
year while the economic expansion already the second longest on 
record continues at a steady pace 
although the bush administration has complained the central bank 
needs to do more to boost growth by lowering interest rates michael 
penzer an economist at the bank of america in san francisco said 
he did not expect any further credit easing in the immediate future 
the fed knows that much of the good news on inflation has come 
because energy prices and food prices have been falling reversing 
their steep climb earlier in the year he said the inflation 
situation is better but the inflation problem has not been solved 
the ppi tracks inflation at the wholesale level the consumer 
price index which measures inflation at the retail level will be 
released next tuesday so far this year consumer prices have been 
rising at an annual rate of 55 percent more than a full percentage 
point higher than the 44 percent increases in both 1988 and 1987

if you took takeover mania out of the stock 
market what would it cost investors 
thats the tough calculation many analysts are trying to make 
right now prompted by the latest tremors in the highyield junk 
bond market that has provided the fuel for the buyout boom of the 
1980s 
the immediate issue the markets had to contend with last week was 
the problems of torontobased campeau corp faced with the 
challenge of reshuffling the coasttocoast us retailing empire it 
had built with debtfinanced acquisitions 
whatever the outcome of that particular case analysts said it 
set up a compressed demonstration of the broader psychological 
effects that might arise should big trouble develop in the takeover 
debt markets 
through the late 1980s the market for junk debt has proved 
much more resilient than most of its critics and skeptics ever 
expected 
it has weathered defaults and bankruptcy filings by some 
prominent bond issuers for example ltv corp 
it has ridden out a prolonged scandal at drexel burnham lambert 
inc the wall street firm that virtually invented the market for 
junk securities as financing tools and has been its chief sponsor 
since 
still some observers said events in the markets on wednesday and 
thursday when campeaus situation became the subject of intense 
scrutiny unfolded as a sort of unscheduled fire drill 
stock prices fell for a good many companies that had been 
discussed as the next possible subjects for takeover bids on the 
reasoning that campeaus experience might deter lenders and reduce 
the ranks of eager acquirers 
so did the share prices of leading banks that also play a major 
role in takeover financing 
traders in all the markets watched warily for any sign of 
steppedup redemptions by investors in mutual funds that specialize 
in junk bonds such redemptions could force interest rates higher 
for lowerquality securities and put other junkbond investors in a 
bind 
and onlookers with a longerterm perspective wondered at what 
level stocks would trade if market participants were no longer so 
eager to appraise them on their prospective buyout values 
the campeau situation apart robert nurock a paoli pa 
investment adviser cites mounting evidence that viable deals are 
becoming more difficult to come by 
increasing numbers of past buyouts that have faltered 
a shrinking number of companies that make sensible or even 
fanciful future targets 
higher interest costs to finance takeovers stemming from 
reduced enthusiasm for junk bonds 
the perception of greater difficulty in meeting takeover debt 
burdens in a period of soft or declining business profits 
no one knows exactly how soon the next recession will strike 
how deep it will inevitably be or how many debtladen corporations 
will ultimately default on their bonds said james stack editor 
of the financial advisory service investech 
but with total corporate debt running at two times the level of 
the last recession we can rest assured therell be a few 
surprises 
the stock market crash of 1987 was blamed in part on a scare that 
congress would move to discourage takeover activity by changing the 
tax laws 
but when stock prices tumbled the federal reserve stepped in 
quickly to provide ample reserves of money no credit crisis 
occurred and within a matter of months the buyout mania was bulding 
up a new head of steam 
now analysts are left to consider how would the fed respond to 
a crunch in takeover debt

the us trade deficit narrowed for the second 
straight month in july to 758 billion the smallest gap in nearly 
five years the government said today 
the commerce department reported the july deficit represented a 
53 percent decrease from a revised june deficit of 801 billion 
in another report the government said wholesale prices fell for 
the third consecutive month in august as a big drop in energy costs 
pushed inflation down by 04 percent 
the decline in the labor departments producer price index 
followed a similar 04 percent plunge in july and a 01 percent dip 
in june it was the first time wholesale prices have fallen for 
three consecutive months since early 1986 
the narrowing trade gap came from a 25 percent decrease in 
imports to 3832 billion and a 18 percent decrease in exports to 
3074 billion the trade deficit is the difference between imports 
and exports 
the overall july deficit of 758 billion was the smallest since 
a 679 billion imbalance in december 1984 
economists had been expecting the deficit to widen as imports 
fueled by oil purchases rose while the higher dollar cut exports by 
making them more expensive overseas 
americas foreign oil bill rose 29 percent to 43 billion in 
july the amount of imported oil rose to 814 million barrels a day 
from 793 million in june and the price per barrel fell to 1712 
from 1767 in june 
the decrease in exports included such manufacturered goods as 
automboiles machinery and materials while shipments of airplanes 
increased 
in addition to oil increased imports included clothing and 
footwear and general industrial machinery decreases included 
automobiles and trucks and electrical and specialized industrial 
machinery 
analysts had been looking for an imbalance of between 85 
billion and 9 billion in july 
but despite the july improvement economists are predicting that 
the deficits will begin rising in the second half of the year as 
american exports suffer from the rising value of the dollar 
analysts also say oil imports will continue to rise as us 
consumption increases and domestic production falls becoming a 
major factor in producing a widening deficit in coming months 
the american petroleum institute an industry group reported 
imported oil in july accounted for more than half of us petroleum 
needs the first time that has occurred in 12 years 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said the big 
surprise so far this year has been how good exports have done in the 
face of a rising dollar 
he attributed that to very strong economies overseas with a 
big capital spending boom spilling over and helping us exports 
but by late in the year the higher dollar will be denting 
exports sinai added 
a higher dollar makes us goods more expensive in overseas 
markets 
for the first half of the year the deficit has been running at 
an annual rate of 1086 billion down 84 percent from last years 
total merchandise trade deficit of 1185 billion 
despite the firsthalf improvement many economists predict 
deficit growth in the last half of the year will make the total 
imbalance for 1989 about what it was in 1988 
a worsening trade deficit means a double dose of bad news for the 
bush administration the administration based its predictions of 
healthy economic growth partly on a belief that exports would keep 
expanding if this does not occur the federal budget deficit will 
be higher because tax revenues will be lower 
additionally higher trade deficits increase the pressure for 
protectionist trade measures to keep out imports something the 
administration opposes 
in other economic reports today 
the federal reserve said output at the nations factories 
mines and utilities rose 03 percent in august it was the biggest 
increase since a 07 percent rise in april and was credited to a 
rebound in production at auto factories and a pickup in coal mining 
following a strike 
the government said business inventories climbed 06 percent in 
july while business sales were falling 09 percent

oh the wages of debt 
consider campeau corp the big torontobased retailer scraping 
to make payments on a mountain of borrowed money has been forced to 
put its crown jewel the bloomingdales chain on the block 
then theres southland corp owner of the 7eleven convenience 
store chain purveyor of items ranging from milk to magazines to 
slurpees slushice drinks 
revenue projections it issued when the founding family took the 
dallas company private two years ago soured and the price of 15 
billion in southland junk bonds plunged in recent weeks as investors 
fretted about the companys ability to pay its debt 
another recent victim of excessive borrowing is resorts 
international inc the hotelcasino company controlled by 
entertainerturnedinvestor merv griffin resorts late last month 
stopped paying interest to bondholders after reporting a 
secondquarter loss and lower revenues 
the chief culprit in all three cases was overestimated 
projections of what is known as cash flow composed of profit plus 
bookkeeping charges such as depreciation many financial analysts 
regard cash flow as the most important measurement of a companys 
health 
the dealmakers expected the wellknown retail operations of 
campeau and southland and the cashcow casinos of resorts to churn 
out enough money to keep up with huge debtservice payments 
it didnt work out that way 
the campeau southland and resorts transactions were based on 
outrageously optimistic assumptions said roger e brinner 
chief economist at the economic consulting firm drimcgrawhill inc 
just like reagan and congress they assumed growth would solve 
all problems he said maybe these people are just guilty of a 
privatesector version of reaganomics 
a slump in the apparel industry hurt campeau which sold billions 
of dollars worth of junk bonds as it laid out more than 12 billion 
to buy allied stores and federated department stores over the past 
few years some analysts believe campeau paid too much for the 
chains 
at southland 7eleven sales didnt meet expectations after the 
49 billion leveraged buyout despite a belief that convenience 
stores are steady cash generators 
the profit margins are thin and slight revenue deviations 
mean big hits to the bottom line said carol palmer an industry 
analyst at the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps inc 
as for griffin he told bondholders in a recent letter that 
resorts cash flow was lower than expected in part because we 
underestimated the time and capital expenditures it would take to 
turn around the companys operations to generate increased profits 
griffin sold 325 million in notes to buy resorts from developer 
donald j trump last year a debt that was piled on top of existing 
resorts bonds totaling about 600 million 
resorts faces payments of more than 130 million this year in 
interest and principal but its operations are not likely to 
generate that much analysts say in 1988 the companys cash flow 
was only 602 million resorts plans to release a restructuring 
plan to its debtholders soon 
the troubles at these three companies once again highlight the 
huge amount of debt involved in corporate restructurings and 
takeovers some say they may lead to more caution by the banks and 
junkbond financiers that bankroll these deals 
people are becoming conditioned to these high debt levels 
said ms palmer however she said if one of the highprofile 
highly leveraged deals of recent years goes bad i think the 
confidence would be shaken very badly 
jerry jordan chief economist at first interstate bancorp in los 
angeles said a consumer spending slowdown is causing the cash 
crunches at these and other consumerindustry companies 
consumer spending was strong a few years ago when these takeovers 
and buyouts were put together jordan said but since then it has 
lagged due partly to the 1986 federal tax revisions and concern 
about an economic slowdown such a reversal was inevitable he said 
you cant tell that to the kind of people that put these deals 
together they simply extrapolate the recent past forever he said 
the problems at these highly leveraged companies which developed 
despite a reasonably strong economy are a sign of things to come 
said brinner and jordan 
it is a tip of an iceberg but i dont think its about to sink 
our economy brinner said

trading in campeau corp stock remained halted today while the 
debtcrippled retail and property holding company worked out 
arrangements for a financial rescue 
toronto stock exchange spokesman steven kee said this morning the 
exchange had been advised that campeau expected to make a statement 
shortly 
the company thursday had told the exchange it expected to have an 
announcement before the market opened friday campeau stock has been 
halted since wednesday pending an announcement from campeau 
there was no indication from the company when any news might be 
forthcoming the companys spokeswoman was not taking telephone 
calls 
campeau has such a desperate need for cash to run its retail 
subsidiaries that it was forced to turn to a major stockholder for 
funds and was widely expected to cede control to the lender olympia 
amp york developments ltd 
as part of a restructuring to cope with its debts campeau also 
decided to put its bloomingdales department store chain up for sale 
campeaus allied stores corp and federated department stores 
inc divisions which operate numerous us chains have run very 
short of working capital 
without the 250 million loan from olympia amp york it appeared 
uncertain how campeau would be able to obtain credit so that its 
department stores could stock shelves adequately before the crucial 
christmas season plus federated needs an infusion of funds because 
it faces a loan payment deadline today 
disclosure of the severity of campeaus financial problems on 
wednesday rocked the market for highinterest junk bonds that 
the company used to finance its buyouts of allied and federated and 
contributed to a selloff in the stock market 
the junk bond market calmed on thursday as trading slowed and 
participants awaited more word from campeau 
torontobased olympia amp york which has a 245 stake in campeau 
was expected to gain a larger interest in campeau in exchange for 
granting the loan there has been speculation that chairman robert 
campeau who owns nearly 54 percent of the torontobased company 
would relinquish controlling interest 
campeau and olympia amp york entered an agreement in principle but 
various other parties campeaus creditors had to agree to the 
arrangements before the loan deal could be activated 
separately campeau issued its secondquarter financial results 
thursday it reported a loss of 124 million in the three months 
ended july 31 on revenue of 226 billion compared to a loss of 
109 million and revenue of 221 billion a year earlier

mgmua communications corp today 
accepted a 19 billion buyout offer from australias qintex group 
a sweetened bid that topped a 18 billion offer from rupert murdoch 
qintex increased its offer to 25 per share from its earlier 20 
bid mgmua spokeswoman mary hardy said 
two companies controlled by murdoch news corp ltd and fox 
inc offered 2316 a share in a surprise bid announced tuesday 
qintex sealed its latest offer with a promise to promptly make a 
nonrefundable 50 million deposit on mgmua which encompasses the 
remainder of the old united artists and mgm movie studios 
under the terms of the agreement qintex would acquire all of 
mgmuas outstanding common stock for 25 per share and all its 
preferred stock for 18 per share she said 
mgmua negotiated with news corp and fox until late thursday 
but then ended their talks 
howard rubenstein a murdoch spokesman said mgmua had 
approached him about a buyouthe thought he had a deal but then 
the transaction fell apart rubenstein said 
mgmua has spent 18months trying to find a buyer satisfactory to 
mgmuas controlling shareholder kirk kerkorian who has repeatedly 
sold and then repurchased many of the assets of the studios 
the qintex deal provides for 133 billion to be paid for 
mgmuas common stock 180 million for its preferred stocks and 
400 million in junk bond debt that qintex is assuming 
murdochs offer valued mgmua at about 18 billion including 
the debt 
a previous qintex deal would essentially split mgmua with 
qintex paying about 600 million for the united artists studio and 
some other assets it would have given the famous lion logo the mgm 
tv operations a library of 34 recent movies and the mgmua 
headquarters building in beverly hills to kerkorian 
but under the agreement announced today there would be no 
repurchase of any mgmuas assets or any investments in qintex by 
former mgmua shareholders 
kerkorian owns 82 percent of mgmuas common stock and all but a 
tiny fraction of the preferred stock 
however mgm grand inc a kerkoriancontrolled company that 
operates a firstclass airline and nevada casinos will purchase the 
mgmua headquarters building in october for 43 million or its 
independently appraised value 
mgmua will make about 26 million on that deal the company said 
in addition to the 20th century fox studio murdochs newspaper 
magazine and television enterprises on four continents are said to 
be worth more than 8 billion 
murdoch who needs programming for his sky television satellite 
channels in britain had his eye on mgmuas huge united artists 
film libraries which include the recent movies rain man 
betrayed and baby boom as well as the rocky pink 
panther and james bond pictures 
qintex also owns 43 percent of qintex entertainment a los 
angeles based producer of television movies and miniseries such as 
lonesome dove

voss boreta was a failed casino host between 
jobs when a broken 7iron got him off the golf course and into the 
golf equipment business 
fifteen years later he heads one of the countrys biggest golf 
retailing outfits one now poised to enter the lucrative japanese 
market with a chain of 30 new stores 
we were just going to have a little store boreta said of the 
humble beginnings of his las vegas discount golf amp tennis empire 
its just kind of grown from there 
from the 1200squarefoot store tucked in the corner of an aging 
shopping center boretas discount golf outfit has grown into a 
multimilliondollar operation with 42 franchises nationwide and 13 
more ready to open this year 
the chain riding a nationwide boom in golf did 47 million in 
business in 1988 12 million of that at its main las vegas store 
alone ranking it near the top golf equipment retailers in the 
country 
not bad for a onetime avid golfer who doesnt even play the game 
anymore 
i havent played since 1975 boreta said recently in an 
interview in his cramped and cluttered office in the back of the 
original store with the company growing like it has i didnt 
have the time to devote to playing 
timing has been everything for the 52yearold boreta a former 
san francisco nightclub operator who freely admits he stumbled into 
the golf game almost by accident 
boreta came to las vegas in 1974 to become a casino host at the 
tropicana hotel but after three days he decided the job didnt 
suit him and spent his days playing golf while deciding his future 
plans 
one day i broke a 7iron and there was no place to fix it 
boreta recalled i sent it to a friend who ran a golf shop in san 
francisco and told him there was a great opportunity here he said 
why dont you do it 
boreta took the advice and opened the original las vegas discount 
golf store in a shopping center near the las vegas airport the 
store grossed 275000 the first year and boreta was off and running 
it was a tenative step into mail order two years later however 
that put the company name on the national map and on its way to 
being a major player in the golf equipment business 
we put a little ad in golf digest magazine that people had to 
call with their own dime boreta said when they called we told 
them wed send them a catalog when we didnt even have one put 
together yet but the next thing you know here comes a couple of 
orders in 
ironically one of the countrys largest golf mailorder outlets 
and franchisers nevada bobs also got its start in las vegas 
at the same time the discount golf shops were beginning to 
expand golf club manufacturers were broadening their club lines to 
tap the beginners market 
these manufacturers got smart and started making game 
improvement clubs boreta said that is what really started the 
golfing boom now you can take a nonplayer and after one lesson he 
can hit the ball in the air and in the general direction he or she 
wants it 
those clubs have been constantly improving and japanese companies 
have taken the lead in marrying boron and graphite shafts that are 
stronger longer and more accurate than their steel predecessors 
partly as a result according to the floridabased national golf 
foundation some 234 million people played at least one round of 
golf last year up from 151 million in 1980 
more than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the united 
states bringing the total to more than 13000 in japan there are 
an estimated 12 million golfers and 1600 courses 
ive never seen anything like the last few years as far as 
people playing the game boreta said it seems like just in the 
last two years it has really taken off 
boreta sees an even bigger opportunity in the lucrative japanese 
market and his chain has signed an agreement with a japanese company 
to open a store in tokyo next month followed by 29 others for other 
locations in the golfcrazy country 
we get a tremendous amount of japanese who come here and buy 
three or four sets of clubs and take them home to sell to friends

an independent television station being 
launched by a local cable operator could signal the opening of a new 
battleground between cable and free television 
wgrctv scheduled to debut thursday in rochester will air 
syndicated network reruns sports movies and locally produced 
childrens shows the station hopes eventually to debut a local 
newscast and is negotiating to broadcast some new york mets and 
yankees games 
its an expansion of cables promise which is to deliver 
programming choice to subscribers said robert alter president of 
the cable television advertising bureau in new york city 
its providing expanded enriched service that is very 
localized 
the station will be programmed and operated by local cable 
operator greater rochester cablevision which currently reaches 62 
percent of the areas households with televisions the rochester 
market has one noncable independent station 
alter predicted that if the rochester station is successful 
independent stations will be launched in other markets some cable 
operators have already begun airing local news shows he said 
lana king marketing vice president for the association of 
independent television stations reacted with dismay to the advent 
of the new station and the possibility of others like it 
this threatens our ability to serve the community free of 
charge she said its a fear that we have had for a long time 
king said that cable stations with the added revenue from 
subscriber charges as well as advertising can outbid independent 
television stations for syndicated programming 
eventually she said viewers could end up having to pay to see 
the same programs they would have gotten for free 
were seeing it happening in sports she said that same 
phenomenon is now happening in all programming 
the rochester cable station currently carries locally originated 
programming like fishing shows 
grc president and chief executive officer frank chiaino said the 
idea for the station originated in rochester but that grcs parent 
company new york citybased time warner inc will be watching 
what we do with interest 
the station was created to increase advertising revenues and 
subscribers and in response to new syndication laws chiaino said 
time warner may sell advertising on the station in packages with 
its other products including sports illustrated and time magazines 
according to james p murtagh of seltel inc a sales representative

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
friday on the chicago board of trade in a quiet session marked by a 
lack of significant supplyanddemand developments 
the corn market weakened late in the session when confirmation of 
a rumored soviet corn purchase failed to materialize 
gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps floor 
operations at the exchange said the speculation was premature 
i think the russians are going to be significant buyers of us 
corn but not at this time he said you buy during the 
harvest not before the harvest you dont get the lowest prices 
right now 
corn harvesting has begun but wont get into full swing for 
another week he said the peak of the soybean harvest is still two 
weeks away

weighed on the markets analysts said those conditions would help 
the crops mature and speed up the early harvest activity

with the contract for delivery in september at 388 a bushel corn 
was 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 235 a

sharon steel corps chief operating officer 
would have people believe his company is failing when times are good 
true or not e leonard kerns view is rejected by employees who 
will soon be asked by company negotiators to grant a third 
consecutive round of contract concessions 
i dont believe it not one bit of it said jim thompson 56 
of sharon a veteran of nearly 30 years with the company theyre 
cutthroats 
kern says the companys ability to persuade the united 
steelworkers union could determine whether sharon steel rises from 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization or is liquidated under chapter 
7 
that in turn will influence the economy of this steelmaking area 
of western pennsylvania into which sharon steel pumps about 200 
million annually as one of the largest employers with 2600 workers 
we lost money in the best steel market in a decade and have the 
dubious distinction of being the only company to say that that 
gives you an idea of the destitute situation here kern said in a 
recent interview in his spartan office 
the nations 16thlargest steelmaker has been trying to 
reorganize under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since april 17 
1987 listing 740 million in debts it could not pay 
kerns plan for saving the company begins with lowering 
employment costs by cutting direct cash outlays and erasing what he 
calls wasteful and inefficient work rules new equipment would come 
later 
a contract has to be clearly in sight by thanksgiving and 
ratified by no later than january or february or we will face a 
number of things he said 
by early next year kern said the company could run out of cash 
and be forced to delay bill payments echoing events that forced it 
into bankruptcy court two years ago 
were that close if the market stays soft and i think it will 
get softer said kern a 14year veteran of sharon steel 
management who left in 1982 and returned in late april as chief 
operating officer 
it was not clear when contract talks would begin 
sharon steel owes 70 million to pension plans for 3500 
retirees and total labor costs are around 28 per hour among the 
highest even for major producers said phil smalley vice president 
of industrial relations 
the companys steel and steelrelated segments lost 163 million 
on sales of 2631 million during the first half of this year 
according to the courtappointed trustee serving as chief executive 
the companys nonsteel operations copper and brass fabrication 
at mueller brass co and coal mining at us fuel co and gold 
mining at alaska gold co continue to offset much of steels 
losses and helped limit the firsthalf consolidated net loss to 25 
million 
how can they not be making money said sharon steel veteran 
bud pears guys are working overtime out their ears were 
producing steel like crazy 
workers say there are plenty of signs that the company is making 
money 
sharon steel expanded its workforce to 2600 by early this year 
to meet demand for its products 
average shipments climbed from 70000 tons per month in 1987 to 
89000 last year and were running at 92000 tons per month through 
the first half of this year 
the steel industry is enjoying its third year of recovery 
and victor posner the miami beach financier accused of sucking 
sharon steel dry of cash after acquiring control still owns the 
stock but has been stripped of his authority 
people say who are you kidding kern said acknowledging 
the skepticism i say even in the good days sharon was one of the 
laggards 
a landlocked blast furnace for which iron ore coke and 
limestone must be delivered by rail and truck instead of cheaper 
barge transportation is one of the disadvantages that kern calls 
congenital defects 
nearneanderthal tools an unwieldy product mix and work 
rules that inflate production costs also work against the company 
he said 
the market is weaker and prices are softening and the loss 
rate is accelerating kern said were losing money dissipating 
assets 
management sees another crunch coming and warns employees in a 
series of redlettered pamphlets that without large sums of money to 
buy new equipment lower labor costs may be the only hope of 
avoiding chapter 7 liquidation 
not as far as im concerned said pears i dont care what 
they do im just down there working when its over its over 
ill go find the next job 
pears and others say theyre particularly bitter about an 
employee stock ownership plan that the employees say is overdue in 
repaying their investments 
ive got 16000 in it and ill never see it said pears 
so you tell me how youd feel towards the place bottom line 
even those workers who are convinced sharon steel is in trouble 
dont sound sympathetic 
as far as concessions are concerned i do believe they need 
them but as far as im concerned theyre not going to get them 
said bob ivanovich of farrell i gave and gave theres no more to 
give

britains takeover watchdog recognizing the 
increasingly international nature of the bidding process on friday 
allowed hoylake investments ltd more time for its 21 billion bid 
for bat industries inc 
in an unprecedented step the panel on takeovers and mergers 
which imposes a complex timetable on takeovers in britain said it 
would allow hoylake to rebid for bat after it obtains approval from 
us state insurance regulators to change the ownership of bats 
farmers insurance group inc of los angeles 
it said delays by the us regulatory process meant bat 
shareholders were not able to properly consider the offer of 878 
pence or 1352 a share in securities the purchase would be the 
worlds secondlargest takeover after kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
cos 245 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc 
bat a british conglomerate with interests in tobacco retailing 
financial services and paper said it would take the ruling to the 
panels appeal committee that stops the current british takeover 
clock until a final decision is reached 
bats shares soared on the developments they rose 18 pence or 
28 cents to 819 pence or 1261 a share on londons stock 
exchange on friday 
hoylake still must win the green light from the us regulators 
in addition hoylake probably would have to increase its offer or 
include some cash to lure bats shareholders analysts have said 
bat attacked the panels decision saying it undermined the 
watchdogs goal of protecting targets from an indefinite and 
damaging siege 
hoylake said it welcomed the news and that anglofrench financier 
sir james goldsmith who is spearheading the bidding group would 
depart immediately for the united states to establish the best way 
to continue to expedite the us regulatory approval 
goldsmith is to meet with claude bebear chairman of the french 
insurance giant axamidi assurances which wants to buy farmers 
under hoylakes proposed breakup of bat hoylake says it wants to 
sell off all of bats nontobacco assets 
other investors in hoylake include british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer 
concern has grown in britain over interference from us 
regulators and courts in takeover fights involving british companies 
with us interests 
south africancontrolled minorco sas bid for the british mining 
group consolidated gold fields plc failed earlier this year because 
the offer expired under british takeover rules while it was being 
reviewed in us federal court 
under the panels rules hoylake which launched its offer for 
bat on july 11 had had until oct 7 to obtain a majority stake in 
bat if it had failed it would have had to wait for a year to bid 
again 
the panel after holding a full hearing on wednesday said friday 
morning that it would allow hoylake 21 days to complete its bid for 
bat after it wins us approval 
the panel has altered its timetable in the past under varying 
conditions but it has never before granted an extension because of 
us regulatory holdups said a panel official who asked not to be 
identified in accordance with british practice 
explaining its decision the panel said the delay caused by the 
us proceedings meant bat shareholders were not getting a real 
opportunity to consider the offer on its merits 
one of the principal objects of the code is to enable the 
shareholders in the target company to have an opportunity to 
consider an offer for their company on its merits on an informed 
basis in an orderly and limited time scale the panel said 
bat chairman patrick sheehy said bat didnt want to deprive its 
shareholders of the opportunity to consider a bid 
we are simply seeking to remove the uncertainty and also the 
damage which a prolonged siege would inflict on the company 
sheehy said 
bat said the panels wrong decision allows hoylake to free 
itself from regulatory difficulties which are entirely of its own 
making

chriscraft industries inc said friday it was 
appealing a delaware judges ruling that the company a major 
shareholder in warner communications inc has no power to veto the 
merger between warner and time warner inc 
the ruling last week by chancery court judge william allen said 
the terms of a class of warner preferred stock held by a chriscraft 
subsidiary bhc inc did not entitle chriscraft to vote on the 
merger of the two media giants 
a chriscraft attorney charles s crompton jr said the company 
was asking the delaware supreme court to overturn the ruling on the 
ground allen had inaccurately interpreted the terms of the stock 
a threejudge panel of the states highest court was to hear 
arguments in the case on oct 18 in dover 
allen ruled in response to a request for a declaration of 
chriscrafts rights by warner and time warner who want the issue 
resolved so they can consummate their merger 
time inc completed a 14 billion tender offer for warner in 
july and then changed its name to time warner inc the companies 
hope to finalize their merger later this year 
a decision by allen later upheld by the state supreme court 
threw out a challenge to the merger by paramount communications 
inc which had sought to acquire time inc for 12 billion 
in his latest decision allen said that under the terms of the 
stock chriscraft does not possess a veto over every merger in 
which its interests would be adversely affected 
chriscraft contended it had a right to vote on the merger 
because its preferred warner shares can be converted into preferred 
time warner shares 
warner and chriscraft chairman herbert siegel have been feuding 
since chriscraft helped warner fend off an unwanted takeover bid 
from publisher rupert murdoch in 1984

the dollar fell sharply friday in panicky 
domestic dealings characterized by wild rumors and price swings 
erasing gains posted in earlier foreign trading 
gold prices were mixed on the new york commodity exchange gold 
bullion for current delivery jumped to 36390 a troy ounce up 
340 from thursday republic national bank quoted a late bid for 
gold of 36250 an ounce up from 35935 
the dollar rallied sharply in foreign trading climbing above the 
benchmark 200 level against the west german mark following a 
betterthanexpected report on the us trade deficit 
the commerce department said the deficit narrowed to a seasonally 
adjusted 758 billion in august from a revised 801 billion in 
july shocking a market that had expected a 9 billion shortfall 
but traders at home said the euphoria was shortlived by 
midafternoon the market was hit with a string of outrageous rumors 
ranging from the assassination of president bush to the failure of 
wells fargo amp co 
with the slew of rumors the dollar came screaming off said 
kevin lawrie a vice president at the bank of bostons new york 
office it was scary 
within an hour the dollar plunged 6 pfennigs against the west 
german mark 
thats a pretty dramatic move said earl johnson a vice 
president at harris trust and savings bank in chicago we were 
sitting at 200 marks it was a wild and crazy day 
one by one the rumors were denied which helped pick the dollar 
up from its lows but lawrie said many investors had been scared 
enough today to step out of their positions and take a breather 
the central banks joined forces to sell dollars throughout the 
day and ultimately traders welcomed the move for smoothing out the 
dollars decline 
the sessions extreme volatility has forced technicians to revise 
their trading ranges it will be a while before we test 200 marks 
again johnson said 
fundamentally dealers noted that the trade report showed a 
decline in both imports and exports perhaps pointing to a weakening 
economy and lower interest rates which do not bode well for the 
dollar

california billionaire marvin davis on friday 
offered to match the 675 billion buyout offer that ual corp 
agreed to with its pilots and managers if that deal collapsed and 
said he would demand no labor concessions a key point for unions 
although he noted his clear competitive disadvantage davis 
said he too would pay 300 a share for the parent of united 
airlines late thursday ual approved an offer in which employees 
would own 75 percent of the company british airways plc would own 
15 percent and management 10 percent 
the pilots offer requires labor and wage concessions and is 
opposed by the union representing united machinists flight 
attendants are still weighing the deal 
the magnitude of the labor concessions the pilotmanagement 
group contemplates is significant davis said in a letter to 
uals board any bidder lacking those concessions is at a clear 
competitive disadvantage 
the pilotmanagement group plan includes a sevenyear nostrike 
guarantee by the pilots and other costcutting labor concessions 
including lowered wages and benefits 
ual declined comment on davis letter friday 
but robert decker an airline industry analyst for duff amp phelps 
inc in chicago said the latest volley by davis suggests he 
believes a bid of more than 300 per share would be too much to pay 
he recognized that he cant top a bid by employees said 
decker but if the bid falls apart then hell be there to buy the 
company 
a spokesman for united pilots who have been attempting to buy 
the airline since 1987 said he feels certain the deal will be 
completed 
we have proven our tenaciousness said hank krakowski of the 
air line pilots association representing 7000 pilots we are not 
going to relax until this company becomes an employeeowned 
airline 
the pilotmanagement coalition still faces several hurdles 
including a decision by the airlines machinists to oppose the 
buyout 
the international association of machinists representing 25000 
united employees has no intention of participating in the 
proposal in its present form louis schroeder president of the 
unions district 141 said in a letter released thursday 
the machinists believe the deal would leave ual heavily in debt 
and could threaten the job security of union members 
flight attendants have begun talks toward possible participation 
in the buyout said carol holmes a spokeswoman for the association 
of flight attendants representing more than 12700 united workers 
in trading friday on the new york stock exchange ual fell 75 
cents a share to 27975 
if a settlement were reached ual would top avis corp with 
11000 employees as the countrys largest employeeowned 
corporation 
davis the california investor who started the takeover battle 
six weeks ago and previously bid 619 billion or 275 a share for 
ual would not disclose his current stake in ual said spokesman jim 
fingeroth 
davis said friday that the course he has chosen to follow may 
provide us with a higher probability of success in acquiring ual 
than attempting to bid against the coalition that has been arrayed 
against us 
the pilotmanagement agreement was announced thursday after the 
employee group made a final presentation to a special committee of 
the ual board and revealed the financing for its bid 
the deal still requires the approval of shareholders and the 
department of transportation which is not expected to raise major 
objections 
with inclusion of financing costs the deal would total 72 
billion citibank and the chase manhattan bank have committed 3 
billion to finance the buyout and will obtain commitments for an 
additional 42 billion officials said

gold futures prices made strong gains friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange after being wrenched back from threeyear lows by 
unfounded rumors that president bush had been shot and that a major 
us bank was near collapse 
from what we can see it was purely rumordriven said john 
jonat a metals trader with deak international inc 
on other markets energy futures advanced grains and soybeans 
were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 340 higher across the board with the 
contract for delivery in october at 36520 a troy ounce silver 
futures were 27 cents to 29 cents higher with september at 5084 
a troy ounce 
analysts said the moves in the metal markets were mainly 
reactions to the dollar which strengthened early in the day 
following positive reports on inflation and the trade deficit then 
collapsed in the afternoon amid the wild rumors 
we had a complete reversal said craig sloane a metals 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york the 
dollar went through what was described as a free fall 
the market gave more credence to the talk of an impending bank 
collapse than to the rumors about bush analysts said because the 
financial markets already were jittery about the credit troubles of 
retailing giant campeau corp 
for the gold market which has been weakening gradually for 
months the turnaround could mark a turning point sloane said 
new lows were made and then you came up with a higher close on 
the day that could be considered a key reversal signalling the 
start of a major bull move he said 
energy futures also rallied late in the session on the new york 
mercantile exchange more than offsetting the significant 
technically inspired losses that had accrued earlier in the week 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 26 cents 
higher with october at 1996 a barrel heating oil was 74 cent to 
91 cent higher with october at 5595 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 74 cent to 90 cent higher with october at 5750 cents 
a gallon 
grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the chicago board of 
trade in a quiet session marked by a lack of significant 
supplyanddemand developments 
the corn market weakened late in the session when confirmation of 
a rumored soviet corn purchase failed to materialize 
gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps floor 
operations at the exchange said the speculation was premature 
i think the russians are going to be significant buyers of us 
corn but not at this time he said you buy during the 
harvest not before the harvest you dont get the lowest prices 
right now 
corn harvesting has begun but wont get into full swing for 
another week he said the peak of the soybean harvest is still two 
weeks away 
wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
september at 388 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 1 cents 
higher with september at 235 a bushel oats were cent lower to 
2 cents higher with september at 137 a bushel soybeans were 2 
cents lower to 1 cent higher with september at 583 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in a day of profittaking following thursdays fierce 
rally which was prompted by proposals to include pork products in a 
foodaid package to poland 
live cattle futures settled 07 cent lower to 45 cent higher 
with october at 7245 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent 
lower to 05 cent higher with september at 8337 cents a pound hogs

federal communications commission rules that 
have increased minority and female ownership of radio and tv 
stations need congressional protection from recent attacks in the 
courts and from the fcc itself a senate panel was told friday 
minority and women broadcasters said they had made great strides 
in gaining licenses during the 1970s when the rules were established 
to ease their entry but that progress slowed under the reagan 
administration during the early 1980s 
the republicanled fcc began a concerted attack upon minority 
ownership polices eight years after the reagan administration 
took office there are only 160 radio stations and 15 television 
stations owned by blacks which represents 2 percent of all 
stations said james l winston executive director of the national 
association of black owned broadcasters 
congress in 1988 ordered the fcc to stop reconsidering the 
minority and female preference rules but the rules suffered a major 
blow earlier this year when a court declared part of them 
unconstitutional 
witnesses urged the senate commerce science and transportation 
communications subcommittee to write the fcc rules into law to 
protect them from constitutional attack 
subcommittee chairman sen daniel inouye dhawaii said his 
staff was preparing such legislation 
in the reagan years the fcc got on the wrong track sen 
ernest f hollings dsc the full commerce committee chairman 
said in written testimony while it used fancy words and phrases 
to claim these policies were unconstitutional we knew all along it 
simply did not support the spirit of these policies 
hollings said a senate appropriations subcommittee this week 
included a provision in an fcc appropriations bill that would 
maintain the rules 
the fcc rules first adopted in 1973 give preference to 
minorities and women in license renewal proceedings in 1978 the 
fcc added an important provision that gives a tax break to station 
owners who sell to minorities 
if the tax certificate policy is ever eliminated minority 
purchasers might as well disconnect their telephones because they 
will never get another call to purchase a station winston said 
another provision added in 1978 was the distress sale policy that 
allows broadcasters facing license revocation to sell quickly to 
minority groups for 75 percent of the fair value of the station and 
end further fcc action against them 
but the us appeals court in washington this year struck down 
the policy saying the fcc had not demonstrated there was a link 
between minority ownership and a proliferation of minority 
programming and that the agency had not demonstrated there is a 
history of racial discrimination in broadcasting requiring the 
preference policies 
less than a month later however another threejudge panel of 
the court upheld the constitutionality of the female and minority 
preference provisions 
the lone witness testifying against codifying the rules was alan 
shurberg the hartford conn broadcaster who won the appeals court 
test 
shurberg who opposed a minority broadcaster who had won station 
whcttv in a distress sale cited the courts view that without firm 
evidence that wouldbe minority owners are subject to discrimination 
when they try to buy stations congress should not intervene 
he said minorities dont necessarily program for the benefit of 
minorities once theyve achieved their licenses particularly if the 
station is located in a market made up of primarily nonminority 
listeners 
diversity is driven by the marketplace shurberg said

beechnut is the second largest maker of baby food in the united

baby food fruit juices and cereals in three plants around the

mcdonnell douglas corp said friday it would 
modify its dc10 jetliners to ensure safe landings even if all three 
hydraulic systems fail 
the modifications developed in response to a dc10 crash that 
killed 112 people in sioux city iowa last july were greeted 
warmly by james b busey the head of the federal aviation 
administration 
the system design changes proposed by mcdonnell douglas are 
a solid step forward in assuring there will be no repeat of the july 
19 accident busey said in a statement issued in washington dc 
once these design changes are in place they will raise the 
already high safety standards required of the dc10 and in effect 
make a good airplane even better 
douglas aircraft co a division of mcdonnell douglas based in 
long beach manufactured the dc10s which have been replaced by the 
newer but similar md11s 
mcdonnell spokeswoman elayne bendel said in a telephone interview 
that the company had yet to decide whether to make the same 
modifications to its md11s 
we are going to look at the md11 and evaluate it and well do 
what is appropriate there she said and of course we will 
comply with whatever directives the faa issues 
the three hydraulic systems on the planes are designed to be 
redundant that is to operate independently and to back each other 
up in case one fails 
in the july crash the tail engine on the dc10 disintegrated 
knocking out all three hydraulic systems an event a mcdonnell 
douglas release friday called one in a billion 
the pilot lost virtually all control of the plane which exploded 
in flames in a corn field near the runway 
dale warren a vice president of douglas aircraft co who headed 
the investigation of the crash said the following modifications 
will be made 
an electrically operated shutoff valve will be installed in the 
supply line and a check valve in the return line of the no 3 
hydraulic system 
a check valve will be installed in the no 3 hydraulic reservoir 
a cockpit light will be added to alert the crew if the shutoff 
valve is activated 
the new fastacting shutoff valve located just behind the back 
wall of the cabin will close automatically and the cockpit light 
will come on if a sensor detects hydraulic fluid dropping below a 
preset level in the reservoir 
even if all three hydraulic systems are affected by severe damage 
to the tail section as happened in sioux city the valve will stop 
fluid flow through the no 3 system warren said 
with adequate hydraulic pressure thus preserved in that system 
the crew should have enough control to fly the plane to a safe 
landing

buyers in australia new zealand mexico 
and canada can bid on hereford cattle being sold here sunday in what 
is believed to be the first international satellite auction of 
registered beef cattle organizers said friday 
the first international satellite sale of registered beef cattle 
will be beamed throughout the world and the united states to 
television viewers who call in their bids to a telephone bank at the 
auction here 
we feel like this is going to be the way to go in the future 
said willard wolf the northwest representative of the american 
hereford association who proposed the satellite auction after 
attending a similar sky bridge between us and australian wheat 
farmers last january 
cattle ranchers in australia new zealand canada mexico and the 
united states can buy from 26 consignments of registered hereford 
bulls heifers semen and embryos by telephone and save the costs of 
traveling to the auction wolf said 
the price of an airline ticket would buy enough semen to 
inseminate 20 cows said wolf a spokane rancher and cochairman 
of the event this way a breeder in australia can make a 25 
telephone call and save the cost of a ticket 
you no longer have to be in the heat of cattle country to have 
a significant cattle sale said carey hegreberg program 
coordinator and spokane area chamber of commerce representative 
sixty head of cattle from 11 states will be auctioned as well as 
frozen embryos and semen said wolf animals are expected to fetch 
2500 to 20000 apiece 
videotapes of animals not at the auction or of bulls and cows 
from which semen or embryos were taken also will be shown wolf 
said 
the foreign agriculture service of the us department of 
agriculture and a veterinary corporation gave the pilot project 
grants of more than 12000 hegreberg said 
a usda analysis of the event will largely determine whether 
similar grant money is available in the future hegreberg said 
noting skepticism among some agriculture interests 
the satellite auction may help to cut through some regulations 
restrictions and politics surrounding livestock imports and exports 
wolf said logistics of transporting the sale animals and other 
items will be worked out between the sales manager and buyers he 
said 
were very excited about it and we hope it will become an 
annual event said wolf if the pilot program is a success plans 
for next year call for satellite sales in japan where there is 
strong interest in both dairy and beef herds hegreberg said 
future satellite auctions would not be limited to cattle and 
other agricultural commodities could be offered for sale said 
hegreberg

a state judge on friday refused to prevent 
universal press syndicate from pulling 26 comics and other features 
from the dallas times herald until the newspapers lawsuit against 
its main competitor is resolved 
judge david west said the times herald did not prove it would be 
irreparably harmed if it lost the features as a result of a deal 
between universal press and ah belo corp parent company of the 
dallas morning news 
they didnt prove to the judges satisfaction that irreparable 
harm would take place and at the time of trial the herald would 
likely prevail west said 
the order took effect immediately but west said he would not 
hold the timesherald in contempt if some universal press features 
continue to appear in the newspaper for a few days the judge said 
he realized some of the features were printed ahead of time and 
couldnt immediately be withdrawn 
a universal press official testified that the morning news has 
agreed to run all 26 of the comics and columns in question and belo 
spokeswoman jodie hughes said some of them will appear beginning 
monday 
were very pleased with the decision and now we can move on 
ms hughes said she declined further comment 
times herald editor roy e bode said the newspaper will continue 
to pursue its antitrust case 
we will fully and vigorously peruse all available legal 
remedies in an attempt to recover these features and all damages to 
the dallas times herald bode said in a prepared statement 
we will continue our suit and continue to fight for fair 
competition in dallas with all our energies he said 
the judge issued his decision after attorneys asked him to 
indicate how he was leaning he said that although he was ruling 
from the bench he had given much thought to the decision 
no one thinks a onenewspaper town is advantageous im taking 
this very seriously he said 
he asked attorneys to agree on a trial date later this year for 
the antitrust suit and set a nov 6 hearing to decide whether the 
case should be transferred back to dallas 
i think the evidence overwhelmingly showed that this was a 
fantastic business opportunity for the morning news the papers 
attorney bill sims said after the ruling 
the times herald suit accuses belo of unfairly increasing its 
influence in the dallas media market 
belo last month formed a joint venture with kansas citybased 
universal press to develop some of the syndicates features for 
television as part of the agreement belo which also owns dallas 
toprated tv station wfaa acquired exclusive rights to universal 
press material 
universal pulled its features from the times herald but the 
newspaper regained the right to print them under a temporary 
restraining order issued by west on sept 5

wholesale prices declined for the third 
straight month in august as a big new drop in energy costs helped 
keep inflation in check the government said friday in releasing a 
string of generally upbeat economic reports 
the labor department said its producer price index which 
measures costs one step short of the retail level plunged 04 
percent last month matching the decline in july the index had been 
down 01 percent in june 
it was the first time that wholesale prices had fallen for three 
consecutive months since a fourmonth drop from january through 
april 1986 
adding to the good economic news the government said that 
production at the nations factories rose in august at its fastest 
clip in four months while the us trade deficit in july fell to its 
lowest level in nearly five years 
president bush said the various government reports showed that 
the longest peacetime economic expansion in us history was moving 
forward continuing to produce jobs for the american people 
private analysts were generally enthusiastic as well saying the 
reports represented a victory for the federal reserve board which 
has been trying at the same time to keep the recovery alive and 
restrain inflationary pressures 
from the feds viewpoint all the news looks very good said 
david wyss chief financial economist at drimcgraw hill the only 
danger is that fed officials might sprain an elbow patting 
themselves on the back 
while the trade report sent the dollar surging on foreign 
currency markets the stock market appeared unimpressed by the 
favorable economic news with the dow jones industrial average 
rising 969 for the day 
prices on the bond market fell as traders focused not on the 
overall 04 percent decline in wholesaleprice inflation but in a 
05 percent rise in inflation excluding the volatile energy and food 
categories this inflation figure is considered a better indication 
of the economys underlying inflation rate 
while some private economists said the nonfood nonenergy 
inflation increase was worrisome other analysts maintained that the 
figure has had temporary monthly surges in the past without 
signalling that the overall inflation rate was getting out of hand 
inflation is falling not running away or accelerating as many 
people have feared said lawrence a hunter an economist at the 
us chamber of commerce our forecasts indicate that inflation 
will continue to decline 
the threemonth string of declines in wholesale prices was 
particularly welcome because it came after a surge in prices earlier 
this year triggered by higher world oil costs and the lingering 
effects on food supplies from last summers drought 
wholesale prices were racing ahead at an annual rate of 94 
percent from january through may but with prices falling since 
june the annualized inflation rate for the first eight months of 
the year is a much more subdued 44 percent for all of 1988 
wholesale prices rose 4 percent 
in august gasoline prices plunged 121 percent their third 
consecutive monthly decline while natural gas prices dropped 5 
percent and home heating oil costs fell 21 percent 
analysts said the good news on energy prices should soon be 
coming to an end however given recent increases in crude oil 
prices 
food costs posted a 03 percent rise in august led by a 44 
percent jump in beef prices and a 39 percent rise in the cost of 
eggs prices of fruits vegetables chickens and turkeys all fell 
during the month 
the various changes left the producer price index before 
adjusting for normal seasonal variations at 1133 meaning a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing 100 in 1982 would have 
cost 11330 in august 
the consumer price index which measures retailprice inflation 
has also been moderating in recent months with many economists 
forecasting that the august report due tuesday will show a slight 
increase of around 02 percent 
in the other economic reports friday the government said 
the merchandise trade deficit in july shrank by 53 percent from 
the june figure to 758 billion the smallest imbalance since 
december 1984 the improvement reflected a 25 percent drop in 
imports which offset a 18 percent decline in us export sales 
industrial production rose 03 percent in august the best 
advance since a 07 percent rise in april the gain was credited to 
a rebound in mining after the end of a strike and a rise in 
production at auto plants 
business inventories in july climbed 06 percent while total 
business sales were falling 09 percent while rising inventories 
and falling sales would normally be worrisome economists noted that 
august data was pointing to a rebound in sales which should insure 
that inventory levels stay at manageable levels

pizza hut inc evidently alarmed by a 
mcdonalds corp experimental marketing foray into pizza has 
launched an allout advertising attack that accuses the fastfood 
giant of using frozen dough 
if youre looking for great pizza make no mcstake say ads 
that have been running in newspaper for the past few weeks in the 
evansville area where mcdonalds outlets have been selling pizza 
we always use dough thats made fresh daily not mcfrozen 
the pizza hut ads say 
the nations largest pizza chain expanded the attack to 
television commercials thursday night 
pizza hut launched the campaign in response to the addition of 
pizza to menus at 24 mcdonalds restaurants in southern indiana and 
western kentucky earlier this summer the mcdonalds experiment is 
aimed at attracting families and couples during the dinner hour a 
slack period in many fastfood outlets 
the pizza which comes in four varieties and ranges in price from 
584 to 949 is promised within 5 minutes after customers place 
an order 
although pizza hut owns about 22 percent of the 314 
billionayear pizza market its not taking the mcdonalds test 
lightly 
the television commercial is very humorous were being 
however very serious to our approach to the mcdonalds threat 
said roger rydell a spokesman for pizza hut in wichita kan 
we want to make it clear to them that we are very strong 
competitors and make sure people are aware of the quality difference 
between our two products rydell said friday 
pizza hut officials have not determined how long the advertising 
campaign will last rydell said 
it really depends on how long the test takes once we see 
theres really no need to continue it well discontinue it 
rather than fighting back mcdonalds is mcdelighted that they 
noticed how good our test product is said company spokesman chuck 
rubner 
we want to thank them for giving our own ad campaign some extra 
topping he said

jitters continued friday in the junk bond market 
where trading remained thin amid wild rumors further price drops 
and lack of new information about the credit troubles of retailing 
giant campeau corp 
in response to one widespread market rumor the federal reserve 
board late friday denied through a spokesman that it planned a news 
conference to discuss serious problems at an unnamed major 
commercial bank whose creditworthiness allegedly had been battered 
by the recent plunge in value of its junk bond holdings 
meanwhile traders remained anxious for word on whether campeau 
was able to pull off a financial restructuring that would prop up 
its own troubled highyield junk bonds which are the crux of the 
markets current difficulties 
one of campeaus ailing businesses allied stores corp was 
scheduled to make a major loan payment friday to prevent default on 
its bonds and campeau was engaged in feverish negotiations with 
investors to draw capital needed to pull off the rescue 
late friday campeau said it had reached conditional agreement 
with one of its major stockholders olympia amp york developments 
ltd on a 250 million loan to help meet the payment 
disclosure on wednesday that campeau might not be able to make 
the payment sent the junk bond market into a tailspin as panicky 
investors dumped issues they deemed especially risky 
traders said there was very little dealing in allied junk bonds 
as well as the highyield highrisk bonds of campeaus other retail 
unit federated department stores inc which also is in financial 
straits 
gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult 
because most trading takes place overthecounter that is between 
dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond 
instead of in bidding on an open exchange very few junk bonds are 
listed on the american and new york stock exchanges and tallies on 
overall market volume are not available daily 
though quoted prices on a number of junk issues moved sharply 
lower in recent sessions traders noted there was little actual 
buying and selling 
among distressed issues federated bonds have lost 200 per 
1000 in face value in recent days while yields jumped to 28 
percent although traders said few of the bonds changed hands 
but rumors that campeau would meet the debt payment spiked 
federated bonds up 30 per 1000 in face value around midday and 
they held at those levels in later trading traders agree that 
making the payment will help prop up federated bonds but they were 
less optimistic that it would immediately cure the ills of the rest 
of the market 
in terms of lending credibility to the junk market as a whole 
its not going to take just one day said one trader 
even quality issues continued to be depressed on friday even 
though there was no indication their creditworthiness had changed 
some rjr nabisco bonds lost 15 per 1000 in face value while stop 
n shop bonds touched by trouble in the retail sector also slipped 
as much as 30 per 1000 
the trend in the market is separation between quality junk and 
junky junk one trader said if people are going to start 
reinvesting theyre going to feel a whole lot happier owning 
quality 
one economist who spoke on condition of anonymity characterized 
junk bonds as a daring investment fit only for a submarine 
commander 
but others countered that junk bond investors typically are thick 
skinned people in the market are somewhat accustomed to event 
situations like this said one trader referring to campeaus 
domino effect on the market she was confident emotions would settle 
down and investors would sit tight 
critics have long complained about junk bondfinanced leveraged 
buyouts and restructurings arguing that the big highinterest rate 
debt loads endangers a companys ability to repay while 
sophisticated investors will remain loyal to their pet junk issues 
one trader conceded that anyone who hated an lbo to begin with is 
going to say i told you so

campeau corp said friday it had reached 
conditional agreement with one of its major stockholders olympia amp 
york developments ltd on a 250 million loan to help the 
struggling retail and real estate company meet interest payments due 
on its bonds 
however campeau was technically in default on one series of 
bonds issued by its allied stores corp division the company said 
it was unable to make an interest payment on the bonds friday 
the torontobased campeau said in a statement it had entered an 
automatic 30day grace period during which it could still make the 
payment campeau said it had met a separate interest payment due on 
another series of allied notes 
the loan from olympia amp york would be used to provide cash for 
allied and campeaus other retail unit federated department stores 
inc to operate while campeau refinances and restructures and to 
meet their interest payments 
the company said the loan from olympia amp york was subject to 
campeaus bankers agreeing to several conditions including 
campeaus securing from citibank an extension until april 1990 of an 
800 million loan 
campeau said it was continuing negotiations with citibank and the 
other banks 
the company announced last week that it was being forced to 
restructure and put its prize bloomingdales department store chain 
up for sale to cope with its massive debt much of which was 
incurred in the separate acquisitions of allied and federated 
campeau has approximately 115 billion in outstanding debt of 
that amount 3 billion is in shortterm obligations carol sanger 
a campeau spokeswoman said from cincinnati 
torontobased olympia amp york which has a 245 percent stake in 
campeau was expected to gain a larger interest in campeau in 
exchange for granting the loan there has been speculation that 
chairman robert campeau who owns nearly 54 percent of the 
torontobased company would relinquish his controlling interest 
ms sanger declined to confirm that olympia amp york would increase 
its interest in campeau but said the terms of the agreement between 
the two companies would be announced when all details of the 
restructuring were finalized 
the campeau statement described the loan as convertible which 
suggested the loan could be converted into stock in campeau 
the statement also indicated olympia amp york would be taking an 
active role in the management of the firm campeau said a management 
group which was overseeing the restructuring would report to a 
committe of directors including representatives of minority 
shareholders 
without the loan from olympia amp york it appeared uncertain how 
campeau would be able to obtain credit so that its department stores 
could stock shelves adequately before the crucial christmas season 
campeau stock again did not trade friday while the company 
negotiated with olympia amp york and its creditors trading in 
campeaus shares had been halted since wednesday 
disclosure of the severity of campeaus financial problems on 
wednesday rocked the market for highinterest junk bonds that 
the company used to finance its buyouts of allied and federated and 
contributed to a selloff in the stock market 
the market waited thursday and friday for further word from 
campeau but the lack of news kept the market on edge trading was 
thin and dominated by rumors 
on thursday campeau reported a loss of 124 million in the three 
months ended july 31 on revenue of 226 billion compared to a loss 
of 109 million and revenue of 221 billion a year earlier

the struggle over control of new 
hampshires largest electric utility settled on four companies 
friday as the deadline passed for filing bankruptcy reorganization 
plans 
public service company of new hampshire which filed for 
bankruptcy protection in january 1988 announced its plan to retain 
control tuesday and formally filed the proposal with the bankruptcy 
court early friday afternoon 
several hours later united illuminating of connecticut became 
the fourth to add its name to the list 
northeast utilities connecticuts largest electric utility and 
new england electric system of westborough mass filed their plans 
earlier 
the united illuminating plan proposed a merger with public 
service the only plan to do so it also called for electricity rate 
increases of 55 percent a year for seven years for public service 
customers matching the rates proposed by public service and 
northeast utilities if seabrook operates 
the new england electric plan called for increases of 48 percent 
during that period 
new hampshire gov judd gregg endorsed the northeast plan when it 
was introduced in july but then switched allegiance this week to 
new england electric because of the lower rates 
but charles bayless public service financial vice president 
called his utility the favorite to retain control because its plan 
already has the approval of shareholders and creditors public 
service also needs only state regulators approval for its plan he 
said 
the other utilities still would have to reach agreement with 
shareholders and creditors and get approval from the securities and 
exchange commission and the federal energy regulatory commission 
something bayless said could prolong the bankruptcy case for two 
more years 
the fact that public services payoff to creditors and 
shareholders would be in securities while some of the other 
proposals offered cash or a combination did not deter bayless 
to our creditors getting paper in april is a heckuva lot 
better than getting cash a year or two later he said 
the next step in the bankruptcy case will be hearings on the four 
plans which federal bankruptcy judge james yacos hopes to conclude 
by midnovember then creditors and shareholders would vote on their 
choice and yacos would make the final decision 
public service with almost 400000 customers filed for 
bankruptcy under the burden of its 36 percent share of the 62 
billion seabrook nuclear plant negotiations have dragged on since 
then for a reorganization plan that would satisfy creditors 
shareholders and the state 
public service has the largest share of seabrook which has been 
completed for three years but has been unable to get a commercial 
operating license united illuminatings 175 percent is the 
secondlargest share of seabrook 
new england electric system and northeast own smaller shares 
united illuminating valued its plan at 22 billion matching the 
value of the plan proposed by public service regardless of whether 
seabrook operates commercially new england electric placed a 2 
billion value on its plan if seabrook runs 19 if it does not 
northeast valued its plan at 19 billion regardless

in an apparent effort to soften the impact of 
travel bargains offered to fall vacationers several major airlines 
have raised a type of discount fare popular with business travelers 
this past week the airlines hiked supercoach oneway fares 
favored by business fliers because they have more lenient 
advancepurchase requirements than cheaper discount fares and dont 
require a saturdaynight stay 
the supercoach fares usually 15 percent to 40 percent below 
standard economy fares were raised by around 20 for a oneway 
ticket 
for example united airlines lowest supercoach fare from new 
york to minneapolis has been increased from 221 one way to 241 a 
threeday advancepurchase fare on american airlines from dallas to 
boston was boosted from 269 to 289 
the action appears aimed at recovering part of the revenue lost 
from the big industrywide fare cuts for the fall season announced in 
midaugust at that time the carriers extended summer travel 
bargains and cut roundtrip fares by as much as 160 to lure 
passengers in the historically weak autumn season most fares to 
europe were reduced by 100 into next spring 
but the latest increases effect is akin to putting a finger in 
the dike some analysts believe 
the carriers are desperately trying to salvage a very serious 
problem that has occurred said julius maldutis who follows the 
airline industry for salomon brothers inc they have had a massive 
erosion in yield any fare actions that are taken now are 
basically to stem the damage 
an airlines yield which reflects the average price of a ticket 
paid by a passenger for each mile flown has become the name of the 
game in the competitive climate of the nations airline industry 
the increase was started by midway airlines an aggressive 
midsized carrier based in chicago that is paying 210 million to 
buy 16 dc9 aircraft as well as gates and other airport facilities 
in philadelphia washington and new york from strikebound eastern 
airlines midway upped its supercoach fares wednesday by 10 one 
way 
the bigger carriers including united american trans world 
airlines delta air lines continental airlines and usair group 
inc quickly matched the move but they raised the fares by 20 
some airlines raised supercoach fares only in a few cities they 
serve to match competitors while others made widespread boosts 
usair spokesman david shipley for example said that carrier was 
increasing the fares in markets all over the country but delta 
is making the change only in a very very few selected markets 
said spokesman jim lundy 
eastern is considering some selective increases said 
spokesman robin matell in miami 
continental like eastern a subsidiary of texas air corp had 
proposed six weeks ago eliminating many supercoach fares but 
the move wasnt matched by competitors and it dropped the idea 
it was an effort on our part to simplify the oneway fare 
structure said ned walker a continental spokesman in houston
