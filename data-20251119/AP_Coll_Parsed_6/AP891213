tons of pollution poured into the mississippi 
river each year threaten to push up alreadyhigh death rates all 
along the river said the authors of a report released wednesday by 
the environmental group greenpeace 
were seeing an obvious pattern said joe thornton who 
wrote the report with pat costner 
the overall conclusion is that mortality rates in counties 
along the river are higher than in the rest of the nation and tend 
also to be higher than the rest of counties in mississippi river 
states thornton said 
the conclusions were drawn from a twoyear review of data from 
state and federal environmental agencies as well as from 
laboratory analyses conducted during a voyage down the mississippi 
by the greenpeace ship beluga in 1988 
pollution was found from st paul minn to the mouth of the 
river it was found in increasing amounts as the expedition 
continued downstream the report said 
the most severely elevated death rates occur downstream from 
areas of the greatest toxic discharges including st louis 
memphis and all riverside parishes in louisiana the report said 
the report noted that some downstream communities including new 
orleans draw drinking water from the river 
average mortality rates in lower mississippi river counties and 
parishes from cairo ill to the gulf of mexico are 14 percent 
higher than the rest of the nation researchers said 
the river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals per year 
as it passes new orleans the report said beginning at the rivers 
mouth the gulf of mexico contains a 24 million acre dead zone 
which cannot support aquatic life 
the report blamed pollution for decreasing fish and wildlife 
populations all along the river 
river pollution comes from chemical manufacture the use and 
manufacture of pesticides pulp and paper mills sewage treatment 
plants and hazardous waste disposal facilities thornton said 
its not a pretty report and the picture that it paints is not 
a pretty picture said costner what were seeing is evidence 
that its time to change 
greenpeace warned that without immediate action to reduce 
pollution in the river as well as along its banks and in the air 
the entire river region can expect more cancer and other problems 
the louisiana chemical association also released a report 
tuesday showing that between 1987 and 1988 its member industries 
had reduced by 91 percent or 89 million pounds the chemical 
wastes they are required to report to the us environmental 
protection agency its members disposed of 924 million pounds of 
chemical wastes in 1988 the report said 
lca spokesman richard kleiner said the report does not include 
all wastes only those required to be reported under federal 
superfund regulations he said the amount of wastes not reported 
under those regulations could not be determined 
chemical industry officials dispute the correlation between 
cancer rates and chemical releases saying the statistics used by 
greenpeace have not been adjusted for other factors such as 
poverty race urban locations and smoking and drinking

morgantown wva a magistrate on wednesday dropped a weapons 
charge against miss west virginia lisa bittinger citing a lack of 
evidence 
marion county magistrate c frank jones said the 21yearold 
beauty queen had a right to defend herself with a smallcaliber 
handgun during her late night tussle with tammy boyce 23 
now had she taken the gun out and held it on this woman or 
initiated the problem thats different jones said but if 
someone has you by the hair and you just momentarily bring it into 
view to scare them off thats not brandishing 
boyce had alleged that bittinger pulled a gun on her during a 
nov 7 scuffle on a city street after a traffic accident 
bittinger in turn filed a complaint accusing boyce of reckless 
driving battery and destruction of property 
jones found boyce guilty of all three counts and sentenced her 
to two terms of 120 days in the marion county jail respectively 
on the battery and property charges and 90 days on the driving 
offense the sentences are to run concurrently 
boyce was freed on a 2000 property bond that will allow her to 
remain free until dec 27 
i wanted togive her time to enjoy her holiday jones said 
this whole thing was really just a cat fight 
bittinger said she wants to put the incident behind her 
this wasnt the first threat ive had from her and its not 
the first threat ive had from other people she said i am 
afraid but life happens you just have to deal with it 
bittinger whose reign ends in june said she plans to continue 
carrying a handgun for protection

the justice department says it has no objection 
to the changes to the city charter that were approved by voters 
last month 
news of the approval came in a letter to frederick ao schwarz 
jr chairman of the charter revision commission from acting 
assistant attorney general james p turner of the departments 
civil rights division 
our work is now done schwarz said the foundation has 
been laid for a more representative fairer and efficient city 
government 
schwarz a former city corporation counsel noted that turners 
letter calls particular attention to the fact that minority 
voters will likely have an increased opportunity to elect members 
of the enlarged and more powerful city council 
increasing minority representation in the city government was 
one of the charter revision commissions major goals he said 
although turner wrote that the department interposes no 
objection to the revised charter he added that federal law 
allows the option of going to court in the future to enjoin the 
enforcement of these changes 
the revised charter abolishes the board of estimate and 
transfers its fiscal and planning powers to the mayor the city 
council and other city officials it also increases the size of the 
council from 35 to 51 members 
the board of estimate had been declared unconstitutional because 
it gave equal representation to each borough despite wide 
disparities in population 
city council majority leader peter vallone who has long pushed 
for abolition of the board of estimate and a more equitable balance 
of power between the citys executive and legislative branches 
also praised the departments decision

the drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper 
midwest perhaps nowhere harder than in north dakota more 
disaster relief aid went there than to any other state the third 
story in a fourpart series cashing in on the drought 
examines how the 39 billion disaster aid program helped farmers 
most in need 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
carl grindberg survived the drought with 
a 45000 dose of federal aid but for this farmer and others it 
was a giveandtake bailout take the money with one hand give it 
away with the other 
the guy who sold me 5000 of fuel he got paid grindberg 
said the business that sold me fertilizer and spray and 
chemicals and tires they got paid what im saying is the farmer 
got the money directly but indirectly a lot of others benefited 
the 1988 drought relief program poured more than 400 million 
into north dakota the nations most agriculturally dependent 
state the money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers many 
say it also kept the state afloat 
its what carried us through in 1988 said cass county 
extension agent duane hauck if it hadnt been for drought aid 
the economic situation all through north dakota would have been 
disastrous it was the major source of income for most farmers 
i dont think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought 
cadillacs and went on vacation in my area grindberg added 
a study of the 39 billion disaster relief program conducted 
by the associated press over seven months found that outside the 
midwest drought area lax rules and requirements led to thousands 
of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious 
than the normal trials of nature 
but money did reach areas congress most intended to aid 
including north dakota where it kept some farmers on their land 
and may have prevented some business closures 
you might say it kept the state alive said fred selberg 
another farmer in this red river valley county everyone in north 
dakota in some way or another was helped 
north dakota where the drought evoked memories of dust bowl 
days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon received the 
most disaster dollars more than 49000 producers shared 4102 
million about 105 percent of the total package almost all was 
for crop loss 
the state the no 1 producer of hardred spring wheat lost 
twothirds of its 1988 crop millions of normally golden acres 
withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps but drought 
aid cut farmers losses from 11 billion to 706 million a north 
dakota state university study found 
disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses banks 
and households from 34 billion to 21 billion the study said 
each farm dollar triples as it travels down main street into the 
economy 
another university survey of 466 farmers said that without 
drought aid the average farmers net cash income would have been 
just 6300 drought payments added 15000 
disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other 
droughtravaged states including iowa illinois minnesota and 
wisconsin the five states together received nearly half the 
assistance allocated nationwide 
disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about 500 million into 
iowas economy an iowa state university study said 
there was no question it was needed to stave off a major new 
wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among corn belt 
producers said mark edelman a university economist 
even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short 
of bringing what their income would be with normal yields but it 
provided a safety net he said 
it was the same in north dakota which has struggled with an 
exodus of young educated people declining revenues fading small 
towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade 
from 81 through 86 the bottom pretty much fell out of 
everything said greg schulz who farms about five miles from 
grindberg good crops the next two years started to reverse the 
trend but drought stalled the recovery 
it has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster said 
dwight aakre a north dakota state economist financial aid helps 
to alleviate that the last thing north dakota needed is more 
negatives to push us down 
despite relief and nearly 200 million in crop insurance the 
state still needs a good year to get back on our feet hauck 
said we didnt get that in 89 he added referring to 
continuing drought in north dakotas west and southcentral 
sections 
in fact while crops statewide are in better shape than 12 
months ago dollar losses will exceed 1988s estimated 530 
million aakre said two reasons why more acres of wheat were 
planted this year and farmers dont have grain reserves to sell at 
high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden 
cass county also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher 
losses in crop dollars and while virtually all farmers here 
received government aid in 1988 far fewer will be eligible a 
second time 
about 198 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1847 farms 
in cass county the states leader in crop acres wheat corn 
barley soybeans sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown 
here last year production was 60 percent to 70 percent below 
normal 
for larry richard a 36yearold father of three who farms 1000 
acres near the town of horace 39000 in aid even coupled with 
55000 in crop insurance amounted to just enough to break even 
we were able to cover all our bills thats all i had really hoped 
for 
if that seems like a lot richard who grows wheat soybeans and 
barley notes it costs him 150000 for rent interest seed 
fertilizer equipment and other necessities 
you throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is 
going to be he said our investment in farming is tremendous 
compared to the average businessman at least they have a commodity 
to sell we might not 
schulz who farms 6000 acres said that without his 100000 
maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay 
off help 
along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves he 
said i was able to mark time in 88 last year we had a 
breakeven type of year this year it was breakeven next year 
were going to have to start coming around to a profit 
grindberg who farms 900 acres of wheat soybeans and barley 
was in the red last year despite 70000 in aid and insurance his 
1989 crop was better but still below normal he expects to get only 
3000 in relief payments 
grindberg a 40year farming veteran who also delivers mail 
parttime thinks the government last year pushed he panic button 
on this disaster thing and went too far in 89 they went too far 
the other way i think 
disaster aid is political he said depending on when you 
have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not 
if its an election year they all get on the bandwagon 
but grindberg will persist 
as long as the banker says go on he said next years 
always the best year

not all who collected aid from the 1988 drought program were 
midwestern farmers faced with ruin cotton farmers in new mexico 
lettuce growers in new jersey a texas company that raised 
potatoes all collected federal dollars completely legally even 
though by their own admission they could have weathered last

last year wasnt so bad for conowingo md dairyman robert 
dempsey good rains in july rescued his feed corn from six weeks of 
no rain and milk prices were up 
but when he heard about the disaster program he went over his 
records with county officials two hours of paperwork and he was 
told he qualified for 1200 
six hundred dollars an hour dempsey said with a grin as he 
milked his 140 guernseys in his long open barn thats not bad 
pay about the same as a lawyer 
dempsey makes no apologies about taking the money it was 
there and i took advantage of it he said but he doesnt favor a 
repeat of the program 
it would make people say i can put crops in the ground and if 
it doesnt grow ill collect he said

chester lathem and his family are what you might call 
diversified farmers they run a real estate company grow wheat 
corn and milo raise cattle and own three oil wells that exxon 
operates on their texas panhandle land 
to participate in federal price support programs for their main 
crops of wheat corn and milo they have to set aside some acres 
in 1988 they planted potatoes on 125 of those acres and saw hail 
wipe out the crop other crops did well 
but the lathem family was far from being knocked out of farming 
by hail on potatoes planted on excess acres 
their farm formally named the lico partnership received 
134087 under the drought program legally exceeding the 100000 
singlefarmer aid limit because the partnership is owned by four 
family members 
the potatoes were insured and were expected to gross 223600 
for lico according to licos file at the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service insurance plus the disaster 
aid brought 214153 without the expense of harvest which lathem 
said would have been twothirds the cost of raising the potatoes 
still he said he only broke even on the potato acreage 
you bet it was necessary lathem said we wouldnt have 
lost the farm over it but we probably would have had to do some 
things differently it would have been much tougher to go back and 
plant crops for the new year i think it was a good program

the 1987 growing year plagued by heavy rain and high winds was 
horrible for ted white a chaves county nm cotton grower but 
no disaster payment program existed to help him then 
white got luckier in 1988 because of the recordsetting drought 
in the midwest although he had a better crop in 1988 he was able 
to collect disaster aid 
i had a cold cold cold rain and then that wind that comes 
down like on a runway and just cuts the cotton said white about 
half his cotton was wiped out last year although his irrigated 
fields still yielded a healthy 355 pounds per acre and he made 
about twothirds of his normal gross based on government payment 
rates 
insurance paid 8959 and drought aid approved by the local 
ascs office paid 18285 even though the disaster law included 
neither cold weather nor high winds

last year was not the luckiest for carl race jr who grows 
apples and corn in blairstown nj a well that fed a special 
trickle irrigation system for some of his orchards dried up a pump 
that watered his corn failed at the height of the dry weather 
yet race weathered the drought well good production on other 
acres eased his losses so he went to the county office with some 
trepidation to inquire about the 1988 drought relief program 
he learned he was entitled to a payment but he felt 
uncomfortable with government programs 
its kind of a personal pride thing you think youre asking 
for welfare he said i was thinking some low interest loans of 
45 percent that would be great 
instead he got cash nearly 12000 
i sat and wondered what am i going to do with 12000 he 
said i decided the best way to spend the money was to buy an 
irrigation pump 
he spent 13000 for a pump then came 1989 and its endless 
rains its been sitting out there rusting ever since race 
laughing said of his new pump

early 1988 the weather was dry in guymon okla although nothing 
really out of the ordinary 
winds he estimated at 8090 mph damaged 1475 acres of irrigated 
wheat in february 1988 by harvest time nothing was worth cutting 
so he just plowed it up he said he didnt have insurance 
months later unexpected help arrived in the form of the drought 
relief bill a program that hadnt even been considered when the 
winds took his wheat 
he collected 11499 
if the wheat had been good we would have made twice that 
much hicks said id rather have a big wheat crop than take a

when high school senior susan bergeron 
learned that montgomery county was selling its own brand of liquor 
the local official of students against drunk driving was furious 
how can a county with its innumerable drug task forces and 
antidrug campaigns run liquor stores and even worse bottle its 
own brand of liquor the 17yearold wrote recently in a letter 
to the editor of a local newspaper 
the question has grown old for county officials who had hoped 
the furor over its county crest brand would have died away by now 
nearly two months after the discount brand of gin vodka rum 
bourbon and scotch went on sale in countyrun liquor stores 
introduction of the house brand liquor brought out a flurry of 
news coverage and critical letters to the editors of newspapers 
but county officials say they only received three critical letters 
and the issue has quieted 
lets put this in perspective for gods sake a private label 
doesnt make anyone drink said county liquor control director 
jerome baylin all were saying is if you choose to drink in 
montgomery county please shop here 
montgomery county buys directly from producers wholesaling beer 
and wine to retailers but handling sales of liquor through its own 
stores county officials maintain county crest is no different from 
house labels of other large liquor retailers 
the house liquor is made by a baltimore distillery which 
bottles it in two sizes under the county crest label 
a 175liter jug of county crest ranges in price from 1095 for 
vodka to 1599 for scotch 2 or 3 less than comparable brands 
but more than the cheapest products 
the affluent county outside washington dc whose voters opted 
to control alcohol sales at the end of prohibition is the first 
local government in the nation to retail its own liquor said 
baylin who is president of the national alcoholic beverages 
control association 
according to the association which represents governments that 
directly control the sale and distribution of liquor 19 states 
purchase liquor and either sell to retailers or directly to the 
public in addition to maryland where only montgomery county does 
so 
county executive sidney kramer said the sale of county crest was 
in keeping with the countys goal of controlling liquor sales as 
well as a source of extra revenue some of the revenue raised by 
the liquor control office pays for substance abuse programs he 
added 
according to baylin the liquor control office has netted 62 
million above expenses in the past five years 
he said it is too soon to know how much money the sale of house 
brand liquor will raise but the products appear to be doing 
exceptionally well thanks to the press 
bergeron said she was angered by the introduction of county 
crest at a time when montgomery county officials have been pressing 
sadd to abandon its policy of neither condoning nor condemning 
teenage drinking in favor of a zero tolerance stance 
basically they are saying sadd is sending mixed messages when 
they themselves are doing that said bergeron who is treasurer 
of the countys sadd chapter im not going to listen to someone 
whos a hypocrite 
the county government says controlling alcohol sales is better 
than permitting liquor stores on every corner neighboring prince 
georges county which does not have liquor control has more than 
140 liquor stores compared with the 23 government outlets in 
montgomery baylin said 
virginia bright head of the montgomery chapter of mothers 
against drunk driving said there is nothing wrong with liquor 
control but thinks the county should not both regulate and 
participate in the liquor industry 
we have enough brands to choose from without the county making 
its own she said

the leftist guerrilla 
movements decision to launch escalated attacks in the cities has 
brought relative calm to the countryside for 10 years the civil 
wars principal theater 
both the guerrillas and the army have concentrated most of their 
fighters in or around san salvador and several provincial capitals 
since the rebels began their urban offensive nov 11 
areas controlled by the insurgents and government forces have 
not changed significantly but the urban concentration appears to 
favor the rebels whose organizational base always has been the 
forsaken hamlets and byways of this small central american nation 
although fewer guerrillas are operating in the countryside they 
appear to be able to move more openly and with less pressure from 
government forces 
in usulutan province in the heavily foughtover eastern third 
of the country the government forces that were observed generally 
were restricted to two paved highways and strategic population 
centers during one days travel in one region alone no government 
troops were seen at all 
guerrillas however walked openly along trails and 
oxcartrutted tracks through fields of corn sorghum soybeans and 
sesame 
in san francisco javier a town of about 5000 people residents 
said rebels were coming and going almost daily buying supplies 
talking with townspeople and trying to recruit new fighters 
they gather the young guys and ask them to accompany them to a 
meeting outside town said the owner of a small business after 
a couple hours they come back except maybe one or two who decide 
to join 
he like others said the rebels did not point their guns at the 
prospective recruits or otherwise coerce them even so one of the 
few young men around said he hid every time the guerrillas came to 
town and almost no civilian males between 14 and 25 years old 
walked the streets 
the rightist government of president alfredo cristiani has 
accused the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front of 
kidnapping hundreds of young men in recent weeks allegedly to 
replace losses suffered in the offensive 
a fiveman rebel squad encountered just south of san francisco 
included two boys barely taller than their m16 assault rifles 
one who appeared to be about 13 flashed a smile and vforvictory 
sign he said he had been a guerrilla for three months 
the army has not completely abandoned the countryside at the 
isolated hamlet of el palmo north of san francisco javier in the 
westcentral part of the province a 30man searchanddestroy unit 
of an elite infantry battalion engaged and routed a guerrilla 
contingent 
the soldiers of the atonal battalion proceeded to burn or throw 
down a ravine large quantities of beans salt tortillas fresh 
meat and clothing left behind by rebels the guerrilla camp had 
also served as a factory for homemade catapults used as artillery 
about a dozen of which were found and destroyed 
in the southeastern part of the province near the pacific coast 
government forces were limited to a contingent of 6th army brigade 
troops in jucuaran and a detachment of marines on el espino beach 
peasant farmers of the region know where the rebels are camped 
after an hour of coffee sipping and conversation a young woman 
excused herself and left a tileroofed adobe house near jucuaran 
she returned a few minutes later to say she would take reporters to 
the rebel base several miles away 
the offensive is irreversible said carlos the 
khakiclad ak47toting regional commander in an interview beneath 
a tree beside a cow pasture the war has entered a definitive 
phase and nothing except deeper crisis and more instability can be 
expected 
some of the most destructive fighting of the urban offensive has 
been in workingclass neighborhoods carlos acknowledged that 
taking the war to the cities may have alienated many of the same 
poor people the fmln claims to champion 
people in san salvador never really felt the war like people 
in the countryside their routine of hometoworktohome the 
desire for stability came to cloud their vision and limit their 
ambition to being able to put up a new curtain in the kitchen he 
said 
we know war does not bring wellbeing its not that we see 
war as the solution in itself it is a means and it is the only 
option they have left us he said

huge crowds opposing a communist 
government chanted demisi meaning resign but some shifted 
the chant slightly to devizy that means foreign exchange 
to czechoslovaks freedom to travel is an empty privilege 
without currency to spend abroad beyond their borders their 
banknotes in crowns are hardly worth anything 
once a year czechoslovaks are allowed to line up for days to 
buy a maximum of 23 at twice the official rate or they can buy 
any amount on the black market at nearly five times the rate 
that is one crushing problem czechoslovakia faces in trying to 
retool a centrally planned socialist bloc economy into a prosperous 
system open to the world there are a lot more 
basically everything that was wrong before is still wrong 
observed a western economic analyst who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity and things are getting worse 
dusan triska a senior economist in czechoslovakias academy of 
sciences agreed adding a litany of crises that reformers will 
have to address 
western banks are lined up to lend money and investors are 
milling in the wings in eastern europe however any economic 
solution hinges on social and political priorities 
above all triska said we have to avoid mistakes made by 
poland and hungary before we open to the exterior we have to open 
up inside we cant use foreign resources until we can use our 
own 
until the war czechoslovakia had europes sixth strongest 
economy with heavy industry and some of the worlds most advanced 
technology 
during 40 years of communism plants were operated with little 
investment and shoddy maintenance the oncestrong infrastructure 
now needs billions of dollars worth of capital 
the system operates at a loss with no relation between costs 
and prices milk sells for half what it costs to produce bread is 
so cheap farmers use it for fodder 
since the 1968 sovietled invasion communist leaders have tried 
to offer 15 million czechoslovaks the softest life in eastern 
europe in exchange for political submissiveness 
there is a car for every 49 people an average worker can buy 
one with 15 months pay most eastern europeans wait years for 
delivery 
everyone has a job and goldbricking is seldom grounds for 
dismissal workers are encouraged to spend weekends at vacation 
homes 
shops offer italian kiwis and french cheeses if veal is scarce 
the lamb is excellent vacations are cheap for travelers who like 
bulgaria 
the system is rich ground for larceny from petty to grand 
waiters sell caviar from the refrigerator doctors take tips for 
preferred service factory managers wheel and deal 
pressure was contained when lives were lived behind an iron 
curtain now that people want to travel and buy western goods the 
closed economy generates growing frustration 
the hard part is that it must get worse before it gets better 
any new government will need a firm mandate 
someone will have to tell czechoslovaks they have to work 
harder and earn less triska said the communist party cant do 
that 
most likely a western diplomat noted a coalition government 
will emerge coalitions are not famous for taking tough 
measures he said 
economists agree that reform means massive layoffs and reduced 
control will send prices soaring subsidies have to be eliminated 
and incompetent managers must be replaced 
we will have to abolish many inefficient factories and 
gradually open to the international market said economist 
miroslav slouf a deputy mayor of prague any new elected 
government will be unpopular within months 
speaking privately czechoslovak specialists wonder if any 
political leaders will be able to break up the forbidding mass of 
state monopolies for industries and services 
one reformer who asked not to be named put it these mafias 
of managers are too organized too well protected they dont want 
change there are so many ways to resist 
the economy was shaped within the soviet bloc when central 
planners prepared to parallel and outdo the west the systems 
though outmoded and largely discredited remain intact 
czechoslovakias largest employer is an uncompetitive steel 
industry it makes its own version of threequarters of the worlds 
range of engineering items 
unlike poland and hungary czechoslovakia borrowed little and 
kept up reserves as other economies failed it supplied their 
staples with a touch of national pride leaders subjected 
socialist brothers to customs barriers 
czechoslovak economists agree they must avoid borrowing until 
loans can be put to use expanding earnings meantime the economy 
needs devizy hard currency 
tourism is a potential source prague is among europes most 
beautiful cities the countryside in forests and mountains is 
often dramatic other service industries are virgin ground for 
joint ventures 
a lot is possible slouf said but you only have to look 
at the experience of our neighbors it will not be simple

rightwing extremist jeanmarie le pen could face 
criminal prosecution for remarks linking a french cabinet 
ministers name to nazi death camps 
court action is possible because the european parliament by a 
vote of 17891 on monday lifted his immunity 
the french justice ministry had asked the parliament to remove 
the immunity of the leader of the national front so he could be 
taken to court on charges of slandering a government minister 
le pen at a rally on sept 2 1988 spoke of public service 
minister michel durafour as durafourcrematoire crematoire can 
be used to refer to the crematories where the nazis burned the 
bodies of their deathcamp victims 
as a member of the european parliament based in strasbourg 
france le pen has immunity from prosecution unless the legislature 
votes to remove it 
conviction of slandering a cabinet minister is punishable by a 
jail sentence of up to three months and a maximum fine of 13000

less than a month after marching 
on wenceslas square demanding free elections lubor spilchal is 
overseeing contributions and poster campaigns for the opposition 
the prodemocracy movement which swiftly overturned 41 years of 
communist party domination now is frantically organizing for the 
elections it had long demanded 
spilchal is an activist with civic forum the main opposition 
coalition which is trying to gear up for elections without knowing 
exactly how they will take shape or when they will occur 
on tuesday it was unclear how a new president would be 
selected under the constitution parliament has until dec 23 to 
elect a president to succeed communist hardliner gustav husak who 
resigned sunday 
but some legislators want a referendum with the people making 
the choice 
there is also the question of when free parliamentary elections 
will be held they are expected some time next year 
the uncertainty as political developments roar like a tidal 
wave across czechoslovakia has left everybody scrambling anything 
seemed possible 
civic forum has opened an office at an art gallery near pragues 
old quarter and young volunteers are having trouble coping with the 
demand for information and requests to join 
we dont have any idea how many people have signed up its 
something like 20000 a day said jana blazkova handing a 
registration form to a suburban housewife were so busy we 
havent had time to count 
the office is open from 10 am to 8 pm but people are 
still coming long after we are closed said spilchal were 
having an invasion from the country people coming from far away 
nearly everyone makes a contribution 
by midday tuesday spilchal had received more than 10000 crowns 
1000 which was to be divided between a student strike fund 
the civic forum and vaclav havels campaign for president 
civic forum spokesman lubos dobrovsky said that in one month the 
civic forum office has collected the equivalent of more than 
38000 and that should cover expenses for about a month 
some money has been spent for thousands of posters supporting 
havel a playwright often jailed during communist rule and now the 
main opposition candidate for president 
the svoboda print shop kept its presses rolling day and night 
monday and tuesday producing havel posters crowds gathers as the 
posters were pasted up and some people tore them down to take home 
a young girl from a town near prague said she was taking a few 
to put up where i live when they are gone i will come and get some 
more its hard to imagine free elections

leona helmsley was sentenced tuesday to four 
years in prison and fined 71 million by a federal judge who 
ignored her sobbing plea for mercy and blamed the hotel queens tax 
evasion on naked greed 
us district judge john m walker jr also sentenced mrs 
helmsley 69 to three years of probation and 750 hours of 
community service at hale house a home for infants born addicted 
to drugs 
mrs helmsley said to have boasted to a maid we dont pay 
taxes only the little people pay taxes was also ordered to 
repay nearly 17 million in back taxes and bear the governments 
costs in bringing her to justice 
your conduct was a product of naked greed you believed 
you were above the law and displayed no remorse or contrition 
walker told mrs helmsley 
he said she shirked a moral responsibility to uphold the law 
that came with her position breaking the law consciously and 
repeatedly 
no person he said no matter how wealthy and prominent 
stands above the law 
walker allowed mrs helmsley to remain free pending a decision 
on her appeal of her aug 30 conviction on 33 counts of tax 
evasion should her appeals fail and she goes to prison she would 
be eligible for parole after serving a year and three months 
mrs helmsley could have been sentenced to 127 years in prison 
if she had been given the maximum sentence for each of her 
convictions and been ordered to serve them consecutively which is 
rare 
mrs helmsley wearing a black dress with a gold pendant told 
walker before sentencing i am more humiliated and ashamed than 
anybody can ever imagine that ive been found guilty of a serious 
crime 
i feel like im in the middle of a nightmare she said her 
80yearold husband harry sitting three rows away 
i beg you dont let me lose harry too mrs helmsley said 
sobbing her cheeks flushed and stained with tears our whole 
life has been work and each other please dont we have nothing 
else 
but she was stonefaced as she left the courthouse with her 
husband 
four years in jail you should have got more shouted 
someone in a crowd of bystanders that stood by as she left 
the sentiment was shared by many in the crowd who saw mrs 
helmsley as the embodiment of a greedy decade in which inside 
traders and savings and loan executives grabbed lucre and headlines 
since her indictment mrs helmsley has been vilified in court 
and out she was a highprofile target her picture appears in 
nearly every ad for the helmsleys 27 hotels the ad for 
manhattans helmsley palace describes it as the only palace in 
the world where the queen stands guard 
mrs helmsleys attorney described her as a tough bitch in 
opening arguments the prosecutor in his closing described her 
selfishness greed and sheer arrogance 
mrs helmsley and her husband were worth a billion dollars but 
she was convicted of evading more than 12 million in federal 
taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses through 
the helmsley business 
those expenses included construction of an elaborate 11 
million enclosure for the swimming pool at the helmsleys 28room 
mansion in greenwich conn along with a 130000 indooroutdoor 
sound system mrs helmsley fancied after seeing a similar system at 
disney world 
there were other expenses 58 for leg waxing 21 for a 
membership in a crossword club several purchases of lingerie and 
underwear 
employees who testified at her trial described her as a 
capricious despotic boss who fired people on a whim when she 
balked at paying a contractor who built an outdoor barbecue pit at 
the estate an employee reminded her that the man had six children 
he should have kept his pants on she replied 
these revelations led new york mayor edward i koch to describe 
her as the wicked witch and developer donald trump to call her 
a sick woman 
mrs helmsley told the judge that coverage of the trial had 
forced her and her husband to hide from the public in their house 
her attorney gerald feffer told walker his client had become a 
lightning rod for hate mail death threats and antisemitic 
remarks she has been ridiculed abused and humiliated in an 
unprecedented way having nothing to do with her wrongdoing 
he asked that her sentence be limited to community service at 
hale house prosecutors asked for up to 15 years of prison time 
two employees were tried and convicted along with mrs helmsley 
codefendant joseph licari received 30 months in prison three 
years probation and a 75000 fine codefendant frank turco 
another helmsley employee received a twoyear term three years 
probation and a 50000 fine 
her husband originally was charged but his case was dropped 
when it was found his mental capacity had diminished during the 
twohour proceeding tuesday helmsley dozed when his wife was 
sentenced he watched alertly 
to suggestions that harry helmsley would be left alone if mrs 
helmsley was sent to prison prosecutor james devita replied 
at the very least mr helmsley knowingly acquiesced to mrs 
helmsleys insistence that these dealings be carried out he more 
than anyone else had the opportunity to see these crimes were not 
committed and he didnt do it 
the helmsleys still face prosecution on charges of evading state 
taxes no trial date has been set

the label degradable is surfacing on 
plastic products from trash bags to diapers but environmentalists 
call it a marketing ploy that should be rejected 
six environmental groups called tuesday for a boycott of all 
degradable plastic products contending there is no proof that the 
products will decompose in a landfill any faster than conventional 
plastics 
degradable plastics are a consumer ripoff said jeanne wirka 
of the environmental action foundation a washingtonbased 
environmental group 
richard denison of the environmental defense fund accused 
manufacturers of preying on the environmental concerns of 
american consumers to sell trash bags and other plastic items 
degradable plastics may be good for profits but they are bad 
for the environment denison said 
in recent months an increasing number of degradable products 
from trash and grocery bags to diapers have cropped up on grocery 
shelves manufacturers contend the products made of a plastic 
compound will degrade in a relatively short time when left to 
sunlight and in some cases even in landfills 
the products include hefty and glad trash bags and several 
brands of diapers some supermarkets also are increasingly using 
degradable plastic bags for carrying groceries home because 
environmentally concerned consumers shy away from conventional 
plastic bags 
biodegradable plastics are made by adding corn starch to the 
plastic polymer 
archer daniels midland co which manufactures the corn starch 
additive maintains that its use will cause the plastic to degrade 
in a landfill within three to five years 
the life of current landfills can be extended by 20 percent 
while achieving an operational cost savings of 30 percent 
company vice president martin andreas said recently when describing 
the degradable plastic product 
they will not solve all our solid waste issues but they have 
definite advantages if applied properly said tim draeger 
executive director of the degradable plastics council a st 
louisbased group made up largely of companies involved in the 
production or use of degradable plastics 
the plastics industry is divided on the issue 
degradability is not the solution to the solid waste 
problem said robert j barrett general manager of solid waste 
management solutions at mobil chemical co in pittsford ny 
mobil which produces hefty bags turned to degradable bags 
because of consumer and competitive pressures he said 
we have found ourselves in the position of a strong consumer 
demand for degradable plastics and competitors are providing the 
product barrett said in a telephone interview 
he said the plastic in hefty bags will decompose faster than 
conventional plastic when exposed to sunlight but responds no 
different from other plastic when buried 
the plastic compound used by mobil is different from the corn 
starch and plastic polymer mixture that makes up the degradable 
plastic products advertised as decomposing when buried 
barrett said mobil had no definitive proof that the corn starch 
mixture will decompose significantly faster in a landfill 
environment than conventional plastic

democrats and republicans are clashing over 
the adequacy of defense cuts being weighed by the bush 
administration even as former pentagon officials support larger 
reductions 
a senate budget committee hearing held tuesday to consider the 
depth of savings that might be found in the defense budget offered 
a preview of the partisan clashes likely to dominate debate over 
the fiscal 1991 budget 
while committee chairman james sasser dtenn argued that 
military spending can be reduced well below current levels ranking 
republican pete domenici of new mexico insisted that cutbacks must 
be deliberate and well studied 
sasser said that as a result of the military buildup of the 
reagan administration this years 285 billion pentagon budget is 
70 billion above the us peacetime average since world war ii 
excluding the korean and vietnam war years 
those massive expenditures have diverted us from the 
enterprise of building a sounder more productive domestic 
economy he said 
domenici however warned that a reduction of the defense budget 
will have to occur slowly and will not necessarily be an economic 
panacea 
will it solve the problems relating to health care costs he 
asked will it make our children study harder in school will it 
make americans more productive 
former defense secretary robert s mcnamara and another onetime 
top pentagon official called for military cuts surpassing those the 
bush administration is considering 
mcnamara and lawrence j korb sought to justify their separate 
proposals by citing a need to address domestic problems and react 
to the easing of eastwest tensions 
in the face of economic and social problems it would be 
folly to spend more than we need for defense mcnamara who 
served as defense secretary under presidents kennedy and johnson 
told the committee we are doing so 
mcnamara called for holding military spending to 290 billion in 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 and cutting it gradually to 265 
billion in 1994 
korb assistant defense secretary for manpower and reserve 
policy from 1981 to 1985 said pressures created by the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs arms reduction proposals make the time right for cuts 
in us defense outlays 
there is no doubt that the combination of 
grammrudmangorbachev can and should drive the level of defense 
spending down by about 25 percent over the next five years korb 
told the lawmakers under his proposal the defense budget would 
drop to 225 billion by 1995 
the bush administration is studying cutting the projected rate 
of growth for pentagon spending by up to 180 billion over 1992 to 
1994 reductions that would still leave military outlays above 290 
billion for each of those years

thousands of workers risk being stuck with 
paying their own medical bills because of bogus insurance plans 
that the federal government allows but doesnt police authorities 
say 
the labor departments efforts to monitor socalled multiple 
employer welfare arrangements are sorely lacking or are 
nonexistent patricia donovan petersen deputy insurance 
commissioner in washington state told a house subcommittee on 
legislation and national security on tuesday 
the arrangements which pool health care coverage for small 
employers who cant get coverage from larger insurance carriers 
were created under the federal employee retirement income security 
act 
states generally regulate insurance and require cash reserves to 
back claims witnesses told the government operations committees 
subcommittee the health insurance arrangements generally do not 
maintain reserves to pay claims said raymond maria acting 
inspector general for the labor department 
ms petersen acknowledged that the reserve requirements would 
hurt many beneficial operators 
with the expectation of staying afloat for a period of time 
through aggressive selling and slow claims payment these 
fraudulent arrangements have become a variation of the classic 
ponzi scheme maria said many operators abscond with the funds 
leaving the workers high and dry the two witnesses said 
some 5 million such arrangements exist nationwide maria said 
the number of fraudulent ones is unknown 
state enforcement agencies have been frustrated by multistate 
fraud schemes limited resources and historical unresponsiveness 
by the labor department 
both maria and ms petersen said the operators try to escape 
state enforcement by claiming that the federal government has 
jurisdiction 
but ms petersen said her efforts to bring in the federal 
government bore no fruit 
she said she was shuttled between the office of inspector 
general and the office of pension welfare benefit administration 
until she finally gave up and used what state court action she 
could in an investigation begun in 1988 she said she couldnt even 
get a list of operators 
you are not required to obtain a license or certificate of 
authority to operate from the department of labor she said 
she said she was investigating two operators one ran programs 
known as the western business association western timber 
association and western alliance of agriculture and one ran a 
program known as the northwest loggers association 
by the time she obtained a state court order the operator of 
northwest loggers had left the state with the program funds and 
hundreds of consumers in some six states with thousands 
probably hundreds of thousands of dollars of unpaid medical 
claims and with no medical coverage 
to date i know of no criminal civil or other disciplinary 
action taken or planned by any division of the labor department or 
any other entity she said adding that the operator gary n 
stone has settled in nevada and is setting up another plan 
unpaid medical claims for the other companies total at least 
100000

the bush administration will base its next 
budget on an optimistic economic forecast showing moderate growth 
lower inflation and unemployment holding steady administration 
sources say 
the sources who spoke on condition that their names not be 
used said the administration is expected to forecast that the 
economy as measured by the gross national product will expand by 
26 percent next year 
that gnp figure based on growth from the fourth quarter of this 
year through the fourth quarter of 1990 is significantly higher 
than the outlook of most private economists many of whom are 
looking for weak growth of around 19 percent next year 
the administration sources said the gnp forecast has not 
received final approval from president bush but they said the 
number is unlikely to change significantly 
the administrations economic outlook which will be formally 
released on jan 22 along with its 1991 budget proposal is 
prepared based on information supplied by economists at the council 
of economic advisers the office of management and budget and the 
treasury department 
the administrations last formal review of the economy released 
in july also projected economic growth of 26 percent for 1990 
the sources said the predictions made in july on inflation and 
unemployment would be very close to the figures used in the next 
budget 
in its july review the administration forecast that inflation 
as measured by the consumer price index would rise 41 percent in 
1990 following a 5 percent increase this year through october 
consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of 46 percent 
the administrations july forecast predicted unemployment will 
average 54 percent in 1990 that prediction is also viewed as 
optimistic by many private ecoomists given the fact that the 
unemployment rate has already risen to 54 percent with higher 
joblessness expected in the months ahead as the current dramatic 
slowdown in growth spreads through the economy 
while stressing that the final decision on the forecast has not 
been made michael boskin chairman of the council of economic 
advisers said it is safe to say that because the economy has 
performed fairly closely to what we were forecasting back in july 
that unless something radical changes it is unlikely that the 
macroeconomic assumptions would change very much 
through the first three quarters of this year the economy 
expanded at an annual rate of 29 percent but many analysts 
believe growth in the current quarter and the first three months of 
1990 could dip perilously close to a recession 
blue chip economic indicators which surveys 51 economists every 
month is predicting the economy will grow by 19 percent for all 
of 1990 far below the administrations 26 percent estimate 
while the difference is small in percentage terms every 1 
percentage point of lower growth translates into 25 billion in 
lost revenue for the government making it more difficult for the 
administration to meet its goal of reducing the deficit without 
raising taxes 
for the current fiscal year the deficit reduction target in the 
grammrudman law is 100 billion for the 1991 fiscal year which 
begins next oct 1 the deficit target is 64 billion the actual 
deficit in the 1989 fiscal year was 1521 billion 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co said he 
believed weak economic growth will push the current deficit as high 
as 140 billion pushing the 1991 target of 64 billion even 
further out of reach

salvador and nicaragua 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday the 
administration remains to be convinced that nicaraguas leftist 
government will live up to its renewed promises to carry out 
democratic reforms 
were certainly skeptical fitzwater said speaking hours 
after the five presidents ended marathon discussions in costa rica 
he said alleged sandinistasponsored violence at opposition 
campaign rallies has raised questions about the governments 
commitment to free and fair elections in february and its 
willingness to allow the safe return of contra rebels from their 
honduran base camps 
fitzwater said the fact that nicaragua agreed not to support the 
marxist rebels in el salvador was encouraging 
he added that the administration also was pleased to see the 
invitation for the contras to register to vote if they do so before 
a feb 5 deadline 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
responded positively to the summit communiques comments on el 
salvador noting that it expressed support for the countrys 
embattled government and called on leftist rebels to cease 
hostilities immediately 
but two officials speaking privately said they doubted that 
the communique would have a significant impact on the thinking of 
the fmln rebels 
sen chris dodd chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee 
of the foreign relations committee said there is diminishing 
congressional support for salvadoran president alfredo cristiani 
based on the perception that he is unable to control the salvadoran 
military 
if there were a vote today on aid to el salvador at the least 
aid would be cut off dodd said there is a widespread impression 
in the administration and on capitol hill that the salvadoran 
military was responsible for the massacre of six jesuit priests a 
month ago 
the communique calls for the demobilization of both the contras 
and the fmln nicaraguan president daniel ortega had asked for a 
dec 31 deadline for the dismantling of the contras but his central 
american colleagues rejected the request us officials said 
a member of the house democratic leadership rep david bonior 
dmich demanded that the administration end all direct aid to 
the contras all aid of any type 
the administration can no longer live with the fiction that it 
is supporting the peace process while bypassing the central 
american presidents said bonior who supported the 49 million 
humanitarian aid package when it came to a vote last april 
when the presidents last met in tela honduras four months ago 
a dec 5 deadline was set for dismantling the contras but that 
target came and went with the rebels still intact most are 
deployed at camps in honduras near the border with nicaragua 
on the issue of alleged nicaraguan efforts to support the 
salvadoran insurgency boucher noted the communique asks that the 
united nations accelerate the deployment of observers whose mandate 
it is to verify that countries do not interfere in the internal 
affairs of their neighbors 
other officials said the first un units known by the initials 
onuca have arrived in the region and that the operation should be 
at full strength after christmas 
meanwhile three house members complained they were forced to 
cancel a planned trip to nicaragua to inspect election preparations 
when they were told at the last minute it would take an additional 
10 days to process their visas 
one of the trio rep tom delay rtexas said other members of 
congress seeking to visit nicaragua before the elections planned 
for february 25 also are experiencing difficulty in obtaining visas 
delay and reps mike oxley rohio and frank wolf rva 
attributed the delay to a desire by nicaragua to prevent them from 
observing alleged attacks by sandinista supporters on political 
opponents

the agriculture department says the 1989 
cotton crop is expected to be slightly less than 121 million 
bales down 22 percent from last years harvest but virtually the 
same as estimated in november 
in its new estimate tuesday based on field conditions as of 
dec 1 the departments national agricultural statistics service 
said a 20 percent drop in the acreage for harvest and slightly 
lower yields account for the decline from 1988 levels 
overall cotton farmers had 953 million acres for harvest this 
fall down 20 percent from 1988 the yield is expected to average 
608 pounds per acre down 11 pounds from last year but up a pound 
from the november forecast 
the delta states experienced favorable weather during harvest 
and show an increase from last month the report said in 
texas an october freeze lowered expected yields 
but cotton harvest made good progress last month in the plains 
and could be completed ahead of normal the report said by dec 3 
the harvest was 89 percent completed in texas compared with 75 
percent a year earlier and the average of 60 percent 
orange production was forecast at 194 million boxes unchanged 
from the previous forecast two months ago based on oct 1 
indications but 6 percent below last season 
this decline is due mostly to floridas 11 percent decrease 
from last season the report said freezing weather in florida 
during late february killed some of the open bloom and damaged new 
growth 
the report also indicated dry edible bean production this year 
at 241 million hundredweight up 25 percent from last years 
droughtreduced harvest but still 7 percent short of 1987 
production acreage for harvest was up 24 percent from last year 
and the average yield at 1436 pounds per acre was up 1 percent 
burley tobacco production was estimated at 543 million pounds 
up 14 percent from 1988 but fractionally below the november 
forecast the area for harvest is up 13 percent from last year and 
the average yield is up 18 pounds per acre 
no new estimates were issued for the major field crops such as 
corn wheat and soybeans 
in a related report the departments world outlook board said 
prospective levels of cotton production and use in 1989 remain at 
near the levels indicated last month although production prospects 
are up on a few foreign countries 
this likely will mean reduced needs for us cotton in world 
markets and lower us export prospects the report said 
the global outlook for wheat is largely unchanged from the 
november forecast the report said for corn sorghum oats and 
other socalled coarse grains 198990 production and inventories a 
year from now are expected to be down marginally from last months 
outlook 
larger output is forecast for canada eastern europe and 
australia the report said however these gains are more than 
offset by smaller crops in the sudan argentina mexico and several 
other countries

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
that among the things poland needs to boost food production are 
agricultural chemicals currently the target of environmentalists 
and federal regulators in the united states 
we need to do whatever we can to improve agricultural 
productivity in poland yeutter said tuesday at the national 
press club interestingly there were two principal requests in 
this area 
highprotein supplements for livestock feed were one and 
agricultural chemicals were the other 
as we have experienced the situation here where folks are 
wanting to ban agricultural chemicals in the united states the no 
1 priority on the list in poland was agricultural chemicals he 
said 
but the aid package approved by congress doesnt include such 
chemicals yeutter said 
theres little that we can do perhaps nothing that we can do 
in the way of agricultural chemicals from a governmental 
standpoint 
thus he said the private sector may have to meet polands 
request for farm chemicals through grants and donations 
yeutter recently led a presidential mission to poland to help 
determine what kind of aid may be needed to help that country 
rebuild its agriculture

aids groups around the country are applauding 
a recommendation that the bush administration stop screening 
international visitors for the aids virus 
the hiv policies now enforced by the immigration and 
naturalization service are hypocritical racist and homophobic and 
must be abolished said pat christen executive director of the 
san francisco aids foundation 
the national commission on aids made public a resolution tuesday 
urging the government to stop asking visitors to the united states 
if they are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv 
which causes aids and to quit marking the passports of those who 
are 
at least 36 national organizations including the american bar 
association the american civil liberties union the american red 
cross and the national lawyers guild endorsed the new immigration 
resolution 
current policies infringe on human rights and dignity and they 
reinforce a false impression that aids and hiv infection are a 
general threat said dr june e osborn who chairs the 
commission in fact they are sharply restricted in their mode of 
transmission 
this policy is discriminatory it is unjust it violates basic 
human rights it inflicts unnecessary hardship and embarrassment on 
an already suffering community said charles carman president of 
the world federation of hemophilia 
for too long irrationality rather than public health has 
governed in this area said chai r feldblum legislative counsel 
to the american civil liberties unions aids project 
the commission said the immigration and naturalization service 
routinely questions some us visitors to learn if they are 
infected by hiv and that this has already caused several 
international groups and agencies to boycott important conferences 
to be held in the united states next summer 
unless the restrictions are eased said several spokesmen for 
groups concerned with aids many international participants are 
expected to stay away from the 6th international conference on 
aids in san francisco june 2024 and the 19th international 
congress on hemophilia scheduled for washington in august 
the commission called for immediate administrative steps to end 
questioning of tourists students and temporary visitors about 
their hiv status while applying for visas 
this would eliminate the current practice of stopping 
travelers who are carrying azt the only licensed antihiv drug 
and blood products such as clotting factor used by hemophiliacs 
the commission said 
travel restrictions for people with hiv began two years ago when 
sen jesse helms rnc succeeded in adding hiv to a list of 
dangerous contagious diseases considered by the immigration and 
naturalization service a waiver process was instituted a year ago 
for professional conferences business travel and medical 
conferences but a code is placed on the passports of those who 
receive such waivers 
dr mervyn silverman president of the american foundation for 
aids research said in a telephone interview from san francisco 
that the rules should be changed because the policy is not going 
to serve any significant public health service but the potential 
for discrimination is significant with a code in your passport 
known to everybody 
the resolution called for a comprehensive review by the 
departments of state justice and health and human services of 
immigration policies relating to communicable diseases especially 
hiv infection

i think weve struck a whimsical chord among callers said 
jess bander an american express vice president theres a sense 
of wonderment about the moon a fanciful enjoyment 
the whimsy has of course carried over to the christmas season 
with north pole forecasts now available 
after new york and the moon the places most frequently asked 
about are london chicago and boston said bander who wouldnt say 
how many people have called for the moon weather 
in case youre wondering its hot on the sunny half of the 
moon about 264 degrees and cold on the dark half about minus 
272 its been like that for millions of years and the information 
is in most encyclopedias 
but for 75 cents a minute callers can hear that the relative 
humidity on the airless orb is zero percent and that winds are calm 
if you push a button to get travel reminders they include a 
working space suit and air supply are required

responding to complaints from french winegrowers 
china has announced that no chinese drink will be allowed to bear 
the name champagne 
li xiaoping an official from the state industrial and 
commercial administration said china would comply with 
international conventions restricting use of the word to wines 
grown in the champagne province of france 
many chinese had believed champagne to be a generic name for 
sparkling white wine rather than a product special to one area of 
france he said 
quoted in todays official china daily li said china became a 
member of the paris convention for the protection of industrial 
property in 1985 and would obey its stipulations on uses of the 
champagne label 
he said most enterprises have been given until years end to 
remove their champagne labels including those producers using 
related names such as little champagne or ladys champagne 
in some cases companies will be given until the end of 1990 
li said many chinesemade drinks with champagne names are 
not wines but soft drinks

two senators contend their lastditch bid to 
back the sale of lincoln savings and loan association and head off 
its seizure by federal regulators was an effort to save taxpayers 
a record bailout cost 
aides to sens alan cranston dcalif and dennis deconcini 
dariz acknowledge that the lawmakers were lobbied to back the 
sale last spring by a former california congressman republican 
john h rousselot and lincoln owner charles h keating jr a 
major contributor to their campaigns and causes rousselot headed 
the group that sought to buy the sampl 
but the senators discussions with the top thrift regulator 
just days before the government seized lincoln on april 14 were 
motivated by a desire to prevent an expected record 2 billionplus 
government bailout of a savings and loan the aides said in recent 
interviews 
the lincoln collapse has brought multiple investigations and 
lawsuits including a senate ethics committee review of 
intervention by cranston deconcini and three other senators john 
mccain rariz donald w riegle jr dmich and john glenn 
dohio 
the five received 13 million from keating his immediate 
family and employees but all five deny any connection between the 
money and their intervention with regulators 
in the frantic week before the seizure of lincoln cranston and 
deconcini discussed a possible sale with m danny wall the head of 
the governments office of thrift supervision who announced his 
resignation last week the contacts are listed in walls office 
phone logs and memos and it was confirmed by spokesmen for the 
senators and wall that the lincoln sale was discussed 
a sale of lincoln could have allowed keatings american 
continental corp the banks parent company to avoid its filing 
for bankruptcy protection on april 13 
rousselot who led a prospective buyers group just before the 
seizure said i was lobbying to try to get a sale 
accomplished rousselot in an interview added that most of his 
discussions were with cranston or his staff 
rousselot said he learned right before the senators phone calls 
that a seizure might be imminent 
he said he was told by a member of the federal home loan bank 
board that its a good thing youve got this group together 
because otherwise the board staff was preparing to recommend that 
lincoln be put into conservatorship 
the board took such action after rejecting the rousselot deal as 
inadequate as it had done with two previous offers 
cranston chief of staff roy f greenaway said rousselot wanted 
the california senator to ask wall to let rousselot present his 
case before top banking officials the senator passed on the 
request and rousselot said he did speak directly with the top 
officials 
the aide who attended the session said cranston told the 
regulator he didnt have any idea of whether the offer by the 
rousselot group met their standards and didnt want to prejudge 
that but if the sale did meet their standards and there was no 
reason to object he urged the sale be approved to save the 
taxpayers money 
deconcini spokesman robert maynes said that in the lastditch 
discussions to avoid a takeover deconcini asked wall is there 
any way for a sale to go through so keating could be out and the 
institution could be saved so jobs would not be lost and taxpayers 
would not have to foot another savings and loan bill the answer he 
got back in all cases was no 
keatings chief spokesman did not return telephone calls to 
comment on the lobbying effort 
karl hoyle walls spokesman and chief of congressional affairs 
said the calls from the senators to wall were appropriate because 
we were not being asked to make any conclusions we were not being 
asked to make a deal but were advised if there was a deal 
move on it quickly 
he said banking officials also hoped for a sale because it was 
the least expensive way to solve the problem it was less costly 
than paying it off or taking it over

lucky for thakorial mistry there are no 
sacred cows in his business 
mistry is probably the only hindu taxidermist in the world it 
might seem strange that a hindu would make a living stuffing and 
mounting animals for hindus revere living creatures and believe in 
reincarnation 
the people in his hometown outside bombay india were mostly 
vegetarians and would never kill an animal he said only the 
poorest and hungriest would eat a chicken but only behind closed 
doors 
no wonder that mistry was considered an oddball or worse 
when he began his boyhood hobby of taxidermy his first specimen 
was a pigeon which he grabbed in the rafters of his home 
chloroformed and stuffed with cotton 
it didnt turn out real good but it looked good to me until 
it started to smell mistry said 
the boy bagged small birds and chipmunks with a bb gun and 
stuffed them in the privacy of his attic bedroom mistrys secret 
escaped the notice of his father the town blacksmith and a devout 
hindu but his neighborhood pals were fascinated 
i always enjoyed opening animals he said i love animals 
my friends thought i was crazy but when i finished they thought i 
had created something beautiful even my parents when they found 
out they liked it too 
mistry arrived in the united states in 1971 with a degree in 
chemistry and zoology about 6 in his pocket and plans for a 
career in medical technology however he said my hobby turned 
into a living after an apprenticeship with taxidermy shops in 
maryland and virginia he went into business for himself in 1976 
his large studio in this rural community south of washington 
dc is filled with striking examples of mistrys artistry 
including deer bear bison pheasant peacocks fish and big game 
from alaska to africa 
beneath a mounted shark a red fox leaps after a pair of grouse 
rising in flight two gamecocks lunge in battle their neck 
feathers bristling 
mistry 43 assisted by his wife jyotsna stuffs about 1000 
creatures annually at prices ranging from 6 an inch for 
freshwater fish to as much as 2000 for a grizzly bear 
business is profitable enough for mistry who became a us 
citizen in 1979 to support his family of four and to help nearly 
two dozen relatives immigrate from india 
lounging on the marble floor of his showroom is one customers 
unclaimed white pekinese dog one of many small pets that mistry 
has lovingly freezedried for their grieving owners 
the pekinese would make a dandy doorstop but mistry says its 
so lifelike that it makes a good guard dog to scare wouldbe 
intruders peering through the windows 
mistry recalls with a grin the time a husband called to ask 
can you stuff my wife on another occasion a lawyer telephoned 
to say his client had written a will requesting that his body be 
freezedried 
mistry turned them both down i could do a human being but 
its illegal he said even if it were legal i wouldnt do 
it 
how does he feel about stuffing a cow the most sacred animal in 
the hindu religion 
sure i could do a cow mistry replied no problem youve 
got to change to survive wherever you go this is america

action said john lawn head of the us drug enforcement 
administration in washington 
rafael caro quintero 37 and ernesto rafael fonesca carrillo 
56 were convicted tuesday of masterminding the 1985 murders of dea 
agent enrique camarena and his mexican pilot and sentenced to 40 
years in prison 
there is no chance of these sentences being reduced 
attorney general enrique castillo de alvarez said 
fernando arias a spokesman for the attorney general said caro 
quintero and fonseca would have to serve a total of 74 and 53 years 
respectively because of other drugrelated convictions there is no 
parole in drugrelated cases 
lawn said the stiff sentences are tantamount to life 
imprisonment and send a stern warning to other drug kinpins 
he said it shows that no matter how wealthy and powerful their 
infamous trade has made these narcomurderers they are not beyond 
the reach of justice 
don hamilton spokesman for us drug czar william j bennett in 
washington also praised the convictions and the sentences 
its certainly nice to see people like caro quintero off the 
streets he said i think the united states and mexico will 
both be the better for it 
the camarena case badly strained relations between mexico and 
the united states in its early stages because mexican authorities 
allowed caro quintero to escape to costa rica 
the united states virtually shut down the border at one point by 
searching every mexican and vehicle trying to enter the united 
states 
dea acting deputy administrator terrence burke said in 
washington that he personally informed camarenas widow and sister 
of the convictions 
it was good to be able to call them with good news for once 
he said they were very pleased that this action was taken by the 
courts of mexico 
caro quintero was a middleman for colombian cocaine cartels 
smuggling drugs to the united states his story and the camarena 
killing were the subject of a book and television movie in the 
united states both called desperados 
he and fonseca were tried earlier this year 
the convictions and sentences were announced tuesday by judge 
tomas hernandez franco of the 4th criminal court in guadalajara a 
major drug trafficking center 350 miles west of mexico city where 
camerena was based 
the us agent was kidnapped there on feb 7 1985 his pilot 
alfredo zavala avelar was abducted a few days later 
their bulletriddled bodies were found on march 5 in shallow 
graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of guadalajara the capital of 
jalisco state 
both camarena and fonseca are multimillionaires whose assets 
include ranches aircraft luxury cars houses apartments hotels 
and businesses which the government is in the process of 
confiscating 
caro quintero and fonseca also were sentenced tuesday on several 
other kidnapping drug trafficking and weapons charges related to 
the camarena case 
the sentences which will be served concurrently add up to 116 
years for caro quintero and 144 for fonseca 
caro quintero was sentenced to 34 years in another drug case 
earlier this year and fonseca was given 13 years these sentences 
will run consecutively to those in the camarena case 
ten other men were sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years for 
taking part in the killings and 13 other men received lesser 
sentences for their involvement in drug operations run by caro 
quintero and fonseca

president bush is throwing himself with verve 
into crafting a 1991 budget trying to decide how to apply a 
peace dividend while admitting his own budget chief sometimes 
gives him 60 minutes of gloom 
the peace dividend is the savings that will come from lower 
defense spending because of reduced tensions in eastern europe 
although some of his predecessors have approached budget choices 
with disdain bush has been going over next years budget 
linebyline in excruciating detail according to top aides 
hes had no trouble playing solomon in refereeing battles 
between agency heads and richard g darman director of the office 
of management and budget 
on defense spending for instance he simply split the 
difference between the 294 billion in defense outlays sought by 
defense secretary dick cheney and the 290 billion proposed by 
darman 
sources said bush decided on a final figure of 292 billion up 
just 1 billion from the current level for military spending in 
the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 
bush will submit his fiscal 1991 budget to congress on jan 22 
white house and omb officials say they expect to have final figures 
locked in sometime after christmas 
under the grammrudman deficit reduction law the 1991 budget 
must reduce the deficit to no more than 64 billion since the 
current year deficit is expected to be from 100 billion to 105 
billion that suggests bush must come up with 30 billion to 40 
billion in budget savings 
weve got enormous budget problems facing me bush recently 
told a group of reporters who interviewed him in the oval office 
i feel very strongly about it because darman just walked out 
and when you see him walking out i go through a period of about 60 
minutes of gloom before i refocus on what else is happening out 
there bush added 
darman is fast earning a reputation as washingtons christmas 
scrooge 
and as some wellplaced aides tell it hes living up to the 
characterization placed on him by former colleague and onetime 
budget director david stockman he was always asking inconvenient 
questions or seemingly preoccupied with the process tactics 
trades deals winning 
its that time of year its december time for christmas and 
armwrestling with dick darman said drug policy director william 
bennett who has had his own feuds with darman over spending on the 
war on drugs 
the multimilliondollar disputes with darman are common said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater theres millions and 
millions of dollars in differences between every agency and 
darman fitzwater said 
darman a master at strategy this year devised a new process 
under which cabinet officers who do not want to negotiate cuts in 
their programs with the omb can take their appeals directly to bush 
but at a risk 
the risk is that if bush turns down their appeal or does not 
decide to split the difference as he did with cheney they would 
have to compete among themselves for a small pool of money reserved 
for highpriority programs 
some cabinet members have told darman no thanks and have taken 
their appeals to bush anyway including cheney and health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan who saw bush on tuesday 
still white house officials say darmans new process has cut 
down on the number of direct budget appeals to the president 
bush has suggested he will ask for small increases in education 
environmental and crime programs and will renew his request for a 
child care tax credit he also is expected to propose additional 
medicare reductions and a lower capital gains tax 
bush insists that any peace dividend that results from a cut 
in us armed forces in europe will not be spent on other programs 
a student at a denver high school asked bush last week what 
are you proposing to do with that money 
its to pay off the deficit bush said 
suggestions that defense savings be used to fund domestic 
programs are some crazy wild speculation the president 
said i will not acquiesce in that

transportation and the faa may have received police sgt robert 
petrowski magoos former partner and guardian said tuesday 
magoo first moved to memphis six years ago as part of an airport 
security program though assigned to the city dog squad he 
remained faa property memphis police withdrew from the airport 
program about a year ago and the faa subsequently decided to 
transfer magoo

like their countryandwestern counterparts 
in the united states these songs are filled with girlfriends and 
gunplay betrayal and bloodshed 
the heroes of the popular mexican songs however are cocaine 
traffickers and the villain is often us drug enforcement policy 
the exploits of drug traffickers and sometimes their tragic 
fates are romanticized in ballads such as death of a snitch 
the mafia dies white load the red car gang and 
contraband and treason 
the mafia dies by pepe cabrera is a classic corrido or 
mexican storytelling ballad filled with nostalgia for the way 
things were before a great shootout in sinaloa state wiped out 
whole families of narcotraficantes 
tierra blanca is so sad and its streets are deserted goes 
the refrain to a slow oompahpah beat and an accordions lamenting 
counterpoint 
new cars dont cruise there and the roar of machine guns is 
heard no more the mansions of those who were kings are today 
abandoned 
the popularity of ballads about smuggling illustrates how 
attitudes can differ on the supply side of the drug problem mexico 
is a shipper not a consumer or even much of a producer the drug 
trade has bestowed wealth not crack houses and cocaine babies 
in the supplyside subculture cocaine kingpins can be popular 
heroes robin hoods who take from rich decadent gringos and give 
to poor mexicans they are often philanthropists who command their 
communitys loyalty like benevolent feudal lords their foot 
soldiers are daring men who brave hails of bullets fierce 
federales and treachery 
by tradition corridos comment on current events on the famous 
and the infamous many of the old songs are about revolutionaries 
the smuggling corridos are a contemporary variation that 
coincides with the rise in the drug trade in mexico 
shortly after rafael caro quintero was arrested in the 1985 
murder of a us drug enforcement administration agent a 
corrido to him appeared 
it took 10 federal agents to guard him because he was a fine 
fighting cock the song goes guys like that arent born every 
day 
caro quintero a key mexican link with the colombian cartels 
also is compared to the lion a king of beasts even when caged 
the beast is now behind bars but you can hear his roar in the 
midnight hours 
although traditional mexican music is popular in colombia 
smuggling songs are not perhaps because they are of more recent 
vintage 
but collectors and music industry executives believe they have a 
select following in colombia where one cocaine kingpin the 
billionaire gonzalo rodriguez gacha of medellin is such an 
aficionado of things mexican that his nickname is el mexicano 
some smuggling corridos are distinctly antiamerican in tone 
one corrido about caro quintero who was convicted and 
sentenced to 40 years in prison on tuesday laments thousands of 
peasants losing their jobs when one of his huge marijuana 
plantations hacienda bufalo was dismantled at the insistence of 
us authorities 
there is also a corrido about the honduran drug kingpin juan 
ramon matta ballesteros whose 1988 extradition sparked 
antiamerican riots in honduras that left at least five dead and a 
us embassy annex burned 
matta a member of colombias cali cartel was convicted of 
cocaine smuggling sept 6 in los angeles 
there have been attempts to squelch the smuggling corridos in 
mexico where the war on drugs has been vigorously pursued under 
the administration of president carlos salinas de gortari 
in 1987 gov francisco labastida ochoa of sinaloa a state 
famous for its drug trade and the birthplace of caro quintero 
called on broadcasters to stop airing smuggling corridos 
he argued that this type of song is really an apology for 
crime something that encourages the narcotrafficking subculture 
said labastidas spokesman mario busio 
the sinaloa broadcasters and the governor signed an accord 
busio said sealing the pact with a ceremonial shattering of 
several offending records 
since that date the accord has held busio said 
elsewhere in mexico however the bands play on as long as 
there is a demand there will be a supply 
this is a company that has to sell records to survive no 
said miguel angel medina a producer for the mexican division of 
emi capitol if the market demands a particular type of music 
well do it

president bush is extending steel import 
restraints on 28 trading partners while giving the nations 
incentives to stop subsidizing their steel industries 
renewal of the curbs through march 1992 will eliminate 
tradedistorting practices in the steel sector bush said in a 
statement tuesday 
the old pacts negotiated by the reagan administration in 1984 
expired on sept 30 
the legislation signed by bush authorizes the federal government 
to continue the curbs for another 2 years the curbs negotiated 
individually with leading steelexporting nations place annual 
productbyproduct limits on the volume of steel that can be 
shipped to the united states 
negotiators in the office of us trade representative carla 
hills announced tuesday that the talks had been recently completed 
with all nations targeted by the administration the talks had to 
be conducted before bush signed the bill so that the import program 
would not lapse 
the resulting new pacts will hold the foreign share of the us 
steel market to 191 percent in the first year of the program 
hills said in a statement 
she said import restraint agreements had been finalized with the 
12nation european community and australia austria brazil 
czechoslovakia east germany finland hungary japan south korea 
mexico the peoples republic of china poland romania trinidad 
and tobago venezuela and yugoslavia 
bushs signature on the steel trade liberalization act had 
been expected for some time 
not only did bush promise to renew import curbs during the 1988 
campaign but his administration orchestrated a compromise last 
summer between lawmakers favoring a fiveyear extension of the 
restraints and congressional opponents who wanted the program ended 
the idea behind the original pacts was to give domestic 
steelmakers breathing space from subsidized foreign competition 
many steelstate lawmakers had pushed the administration to 
extend the curbs for another five years but bush opted for a 
smallerscale program in deference to steelusing manufacturers 
the manufacturers argued that the quotas have driven up prices and 
caused supply shortages of some steel products 
bush called the countrybycounty agreements a stepping 
stone to the day when all tradedistorting subsidies could be 
eliminated 
the program is structured to give nations incentives to trade 
freely 
for example the pacts allow some countries market shares to 
rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are phased out 
entirely at the end of the program hills said the yearly increase 
will be allocated to nations that exhibit the most willingness to 
stop subsidizing their domestic steelmakers 
some nations have already been granted such status hills said 
she identified those tuesday as the european community japan 
south korea brazil mexico australia and trinidad and tobago

legislation that would scrap the 
starspangled banner as the national anthem has riled people in 
the hometown of francis scott key who wrote the song 175 years ago 
i honestly feel they should leave it be said harry l 
decker fredericks historian i think its more like a hymn than 
a song it brings tears to a lot of peoples eyes 
rep andrew jacobs jr dind has introduced legislation in 
congress for the ninth time in 12 years to supplant it with 
america the beautiful 
decker said tuesday he thought the campaign for change was being 
fueled by people who believe the song embraces war and by those who 
think its too hard to sing 
if they cant sing it they cant sing decker said 
david maloney jr president of the historical society of 
frederick county said he liked america the beautiful but 
thinks its less emotionally stirring than the starspangled 
banner 
the proposal to replace the national anthem also has struck a 
sensitive chord with the frederick keys the citys new minor 
league baseball team 
his monument in mount olivet cemetery faces our new 
stadium said mark zeigler the teams assistant general manager 
ive got a lot of pride in this area and the state 
this is something of local significance that is national it 
would take away some of the significance 
frederick county arts council director carole werking said i 
like america the beautiful i think it is easier to sing but 
francis scott key being fredericks native son and having a lot of 
pride in my community i dont think we should change it 
gov william donald schaefer has written to marylands 
congressional delegation urging them to oppose any change 
jacobs said the protests probably are unnecessary because he 
doesnt think his bill will pass

the interior department is allowing many 
violations of environmental regulations under its oil and gas 
leasing program because of lax monitoring according to an internal 
audit 
the report by the departments inspector generals office said 
tuesday that oil and gas lease operators on federal or indian lands 
who commit violations often do so without fear of being 
punished because civil penalties are rarely assessed 
even when lease operators are shown to be repeat offenders 
their poor record often was swept clean without monetary penalties 
if corrections on specific violations were made the investigators 
added 
the report covered the federal bureau of land managements 
scrutiny of oil and gas leases throughout the west during a 
twoyear period beginning in fiscal 1988 
investigators focused on activities in eight bureau offices with 
jurisdiction over more than 39000 oil and gas wells about half of 
those under the federal program all the wells are either on 
federal or indian land 
bureau spokesman bob johns said the agency was reviewing the 
report but that the bureau agreed generally with many of the 
findings and recommendations a formal response by the agency is 
expected to be completed by february he said 
violations of existing regulations have resulted in 
environmental damage lost or unpaid royalties and a potentially 
substantial government liability for plugging abandoned wells and 
cleaning up well sites the report said 
the report said that during fiscal 1988 federal inspectors 
uncovered 1317 violations of environmental regulations and other 
infractions but assessed only 11500 in penalties 
among the violations were 277 that were considered major 
the report said 
in many cases however environmental violations and 
questionable activities by lease holders went unnoticed because of 
inadequate checks on well abandonments venting practices and other 
activities the investigators said 
among the findings were 
lease operators are being widely allowed to abandon wells 
without getting required government approval leaving no clear 
picture as to how many wells are productive or whether abandoned 
wells have been properly closed 
in some cases wells were found to have been abandoned 15 years 
or more without an authorized inspectors approval and certainty of 
their environmental condition 
unauthorized venting or flaring of natural gas some dating to 
the 1960s is widespread among lease operators posing 
environmental concerns and preventing the government from 
collecting royalties about 291000 for an estimated 1 billion 
cubic feet of gas in the limited number of cases documented 
bonding requirements are inadequate to protect against smaller 
lease operators abandoning sites without taking proper 
environmental precautions in many cases the government will have 
to assume responsibility 
there could be a significant number of wells throughout the 
country which are either plugged improperly or not plugged and 
these wells could be adversely impacting the environment the 
report said 
the cost of potentially capping some 22000 wells in question 
was put at more than 300 million 
some of the cases cited involved 
a montana lease holder who was told he had to test only nine of 
his 150 wells to determine whether all of them should be considered 
temporarily closed operating or be in line for capping they did 
not want to overburden him the report said 
a california lease purchaser who was allowed to buy 30 closed 
or temporarily abandoned wells with a bond of only 25000 after 
he filed for bankruptcy without capping any of the wells the 
government was left with a 378000 bill 
a lease operator who was shown on videotape dumping extracted 
saltwater into an unlined unauthorized pit in violation of 
environmental regulations although the operator was told in 35 
letters over a twomonth period to correct the practice no 
monetary penalty was assessed 
a well on indian land that blew after a lease holder began 
extracting natural gas without having conducted promised pressure 
tests he was fined only 5000 although up to 4 million cubic feet 
of gas a day were released over 65 days causing the evacuation of 
nearby residents and raising concern that local water supplies may 
have been contaminated

embodied for centuries can help in the work of renewal of our 
country and that this renewal is already happening

cannot live without god

an fbi report includes evidence the agency 
believes could support allegations that mayor marion barry used 
drugs but it does not recommend whether an indictment should be 
sought according to a published report 
the washington post today cited anonymous sources who said 
prosecutors have not made any decision on whether charges against 
barry should be filed 
after six years of intermittent federal inquiries on the mayors 
conduct the report represents the first focus on a possible case 
against barry the newspaper said 
the sources say the report makes it clear that the fbi has 
concluded it has obtained enough information for prosecutors to 
decide whether to seek an indictment against barry the post 
reported 
it was expected to cover the alleged use of illegal drugs by the 
mayor and whether he committed perjury when he testified before a 
grand jury in january concerning his relationship with convicted 
cocaine dealer charles lewis the post said 
lewis who is cooperating with federal investigators testified 
tuesday before the grand jury and was expected to return on 
thursday 
sections of the report were sent to us attorney jay b 
stephens sources told the paper the decision on whether to go 
further rests with stephens 
r kenneth mundy the mayors attorney said barry is 
absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing he said barry is not 
concerned about any case that would be based on allegations by 
lewis 
hes lewis trying to save himself mundy told the post 
were not bedeviled by charles lewis this is a man who would lie 
about anything 
this is another example of the post vendetta to get the mayor 
out of office said lurma rackley the mayors press secretary 
the media should let the case be tried in the courts and not in 
the press

billionaire leona helmsley told a judge she was 
in the middle of a nightmare before he declared her 
unremorseful sentenced her to four years in prison and ordered her 
to pay 88 million for tax evasion 
mrs helmsley portrayed as a regal perfectionist in 
advertisements for her hotel empire sobbed and begged for mercy at 
her sentencing tuesday 
but us district judge john m walker jr was unswayed saying 
naked greed caused her downfall 
you believed you were above the law and displayed no remorse 
or contrition said walker you bear the full responsibility 
for this scheme with all of its fraudulent permutations you 
were at the apex of the pyramid of wrongdoing 
besides prison walker imposed three years probation and 750 
hours of community service recommending that she work at a harlem 
home for infants born addicted to drugs she would be eligible for 
parole after 16 months 
walker also fined her 71 million and ordered one other penalty 
on the woman once said to have boasted to a maid we dont pay 
taxes only the little people pay taxes she must repay close to 
17 million in back taxes and bear the governments costs in 
bringing her to justice 
no person he said no matter how wealthy and prominent 
stands above the law 
as the 69yearold mrs helmsley made her tearful appeal to the 
judge her ailing 80yearold husband harry sat three rows away 
i am more humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine 
that ive been found guilty of a serious crime said mrs 
helmsley dressed in black i feel like im in the middle of a 
nightmare 
a few years ago i lost my only son she said adding that 
it ripped me apart when she saw photographs of his grave 
published 
i beg you dont let me lose harry too she said our 
whole life has been work and each other please dont we have 
nothing else 
the helmsleys with a personal fortune of 1 billion have 5 
billion in real estate holdings including 27 hotels and the empire 
state building 
mrs helmsley was convicted of evading more than 12 million in 
federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses 
through the helmsley business she has appealed the aug 30 verdict 
that found her guilty of 33 counts of tax evasion and she remains 
free on unspecified bail 
after the sentencing mrs helmsley walked down the courthouse 
steps with her husband while a crowd taunted her 
four years in jail you should have got more shouted one 
bystander 
among the expenses she was found to have fraudulently billed to 
her business was the construction of a 11 million enclosure for 
the swimming pool of the helmsleys 28room mansion in greenwich 
conn 
other expenses were much smaller 58 for leg waxing for 
example 
since her indictment mrs helmsley has been vilified in court 
and out she was a highprofile target her picture is part of 
nearly every ad for the helmsleys hotels the ad for manhattans 
helmsley palace describes it as the only palace in the world 
where the queen stands guard 
even her own lawyer described her as a tough bitch in 
opening arguments employees who testified at her trial described 
her as a capricious despotic boss 
mrs helmsley told the judge that coverage of the trial had 
forced her and her husband to hide from the public in their house 
her attorney gerald feffer told walker his client had become a

workers at several government nuclear weapons 
plants face unnecessary risks of radiation contamination in part 
because too little is spent on protective measures according to 
energy department inspection reports 
the problem persists despite greatly increased attention in 
recent years to health safety and environmental hazards at the 
weapons plants 
flaws in worker protection against radiation are a recurring 
though little publicized theme in recently released health and 
safety reports following inspections of facilities in four states 
the inspections by government and private experts ordered by 
energy secretary james d watkins in june document radiation 
control problems at the pantex weapons assembly factory near 
amarillo texas the y12 nuclear materials manufacturing plant at 
oak ridge tenn the fernald uranium processing plant near 
cincinnati ohio and the rocky flats plutonium processing plant 
near denver colo 
inspections also were conducted at weapons sites in kansas city 
mo mercury nev and piketon ohio but the results have not yet 
been publicly released all 17 major weapons facilities eventually 
are to undergo such inspections 
the pantex report published last week said that while inspectors 
found no clear and immediate danger to worker safety the radiation 
protection program was generally inadequate as evidenced by 
extensive violations of federal regulations 
the report said the energy department and the company that runs 
pantex under a government contract mason amp hangersilas mason co 
have been aware of the problem for several years yet little has 
been achieved to correct it 
in a memo attached to the pantex report watkins said the 
findings indicate workers are not adequately protected from routine 
and emergency releases of radiation he ordered immediate action to 
fix the problems 
in late october watkins ordered special action to correct 
weaknesses in radiation protection at the y12 plant at the federal 
oak ridge nuclear reservation 
the y12 inspection team reported a variety of major problems 
among them was a failure of the plants health physics specialists 
to routinely check radiation levels in all areas where significant 
amounts of radiation could be present 
the report also said radiation survey results often are poorly 
documented and that the plant does not routinely check for flaws 
in warning devices and other safety features of equipment that 
generates radiation for example such checks are not routinely 
done on electronbeam welders which produce radiation fields 
comparable to and sometimes higher than xray machines the 
report said 
the inspectors said no health physics specialists were present 
to monitor radiation levels when workers removed an air filter from 
the roof of a building at the y12 plant despite the potential 
for spreading contamination on the roof and also for an unmonitored 
release of airborne radiation 
also the report said safety work permits prepared for 
employees at y12 were not an effective means of informing 
workers of the radiological conditions that may be encountered at 
the job site 
significant flaws in radiation protection also were found by 
inspectors at fernald where production lines were closed earlier 
this year because of pressing environmental problems 
workers at one fernald building may have unknowingly ingested 
radioactive uranium metal aerosols because of ventilation defects 
in an area where workers are not required to wear respirators the 
inspection report of last august said 
only limited corrections can be made at fernald because of a 
lack of money the report said budget problems also prevent a 
quick correction of deficiencies in training of radiation workers 
and radiation protection technicians the report said 
inspectors of the rocky flats plant which makes plutonium 
triggers for nuclear weapons cited a variety of radiation 
contamination problems including uncertainty about the accuracy of 
measurements of plutonium particles in the air they said the 
measuring equipment is old and prone to breakdowns 
rocky flats plutonium operations were shut down last month for 
a management shakeup last year the plant was closed for several 
months after two employees walked unknowingly into a contaminated 
area and inhaled radioactive particles

the boy scouts and the pta two 
apple pie groups cant agree on whos responsible for the 
bad apple scout leaders who sometimes lead to another american 
tradition lawsuits 
the california congress of parents teachers and students inc 
the state pta this fall told its local chapters to stop sponsoring 
boy scout troops and cub scout packs after the national pta and 
the boy scouts of america failed to agree on responsibility for 
screening leaders 
ptas in some other states have taken similar action officials 
said 
of the 10000 scout units in california about 600 mostly cub 
scout packs are currently sponsored by neighborhood school ptas 
according to richard parker assistant director of the western 
region of the boys scouts of america 
ptas and scout units have coexisted for 50 years with parents 
from one group often deeply involved in the other scout troops 
also can be sponsored by other organizations such as church or 
civic clubs 
concerned about lawsuits stemming from child abuse or other 
misguidance by scout leaders the national scouts and pta have been 
struggling to come up with a compromise since last year on new 
charter application forms written by the boy scouts of america the 
forms place the responsibility for screening selecting and 
approving local scout leaders on the sponsors 
who can better assess them asked lee sneath a dallas 
publicist for boy scouts of america 
but national pta president manya ungar wrote in an october 1988 
letter to state and local ptas this responsibility could result 
in increased liability to pta units and possibly to their leaders 
should some unfortunate situation develop involving the leadership 
of the local scout organization 
the two national groups began negotiations in mid1988 that 
continued through this year the boy scouts agreed not to change 
its charter arrangements with the pta until july 1 1989 
that deadline passed without a resolution and the national pta 
informed its state chapters that it was leaving the decision about 
sponsorship to them 
we have nothing that says they can or cannot sponsor boy scout 
troops thats up to the local units said tari marshall public 
relations director for the national pta 
she said a few states have recommended that local units not sign 
charters 
the illinois pta advised its local units not to do so in october 
1988 said illinois president gretchen mcdowell our liability 
insurance put a waiver in so it will not cover any boy scout 
activity 
we know its a very difficult issue she said my kids 
were boy scouts it has nothing to do with a very fine 
organization the boy scouts it has to do with us accepting 
responsibility for their leaders 
she said other youth groups such as girl scouts recruit and 
train their own leaders and do not require sponsoring organization 
to accept responsibility for the leaders 
california pta president dorothy leonard who sent letters to 
local chapters advising them of the cutoff in september said she 
plans to meet with parker to try to resolve the problem 
we do have a problem but we believe it can be worked out 
parker said recently 
but marshall of the chicagobased national pta said meetings 
have been fruitless 
really its up to boy scouts to come back to us if they feel 
they want to make a change she said 
parker notes that the boy scouts of america carries liability 
insurance for all its registered leaders but pta officials are 
worried that courts might interpret the new charter forms as 
putting the onus on their organizations 
parker said if a schools pta wont sponsor a scout group then 
a group of parents in the neighborhood could get together and sign 
the charter

parliaments decision to allow the government to 
prosecute alleged nazi war criminals is expected to result in the 
trials of at least three aging emigres suspected of the mass murder 
of jews 
rabbi marvin hier head of the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles which first brought the issue to the attention of british 
authorities issued a statement after tuesdays vote that said 
the british parliaments decision is not an act of vengeance 
but a victory for justice it states clearly that crimes against 
humanity can take no refuge in the passing of time and keeps faith 
with the victims of the holocaust 
home secretary david waddington urged the trials saying it 
is the instinctive wish of most us to get on with our lives in 
peace and not to rake over the past but sometimes one is brought 
face to face with facts that cannot be buried 
prime minister margaret thatcher and opposition labor party 
leader neil kinnock both voted in favor of prosecution which 
passed 348123 
in order for the prosecutions to proceed parliament must pass 
further legislation that would enable naturalized british citizens 
to be prosecuted for crimes committed abroad the office of the 
director of public prosecutions would decide whether individual 
prosecutions should go ahead 
australia and canada have passed similar legislation within the 
past few years the us justice department investigates and 
deports suspects for trial in israel 
the action in parliament followed the publication of a 
governmentcommissioned report july 24 saying there is enough 
evidence to prosecute four suspects one of whom has since died it 
urged further investigation in another 124 cases 
the suspects were not identified in the report published after a 
yearlong investigation by two prominent lawyers including sir 
thomas hetherington britains former director of public 
prosecutions 
the inquiry was set up after the simon wiesenthal center which 
accused britain of footdragging on the issue submitted a list of 
suspects to the government in 1986 
almost all the suspects in britain are from lithuania latvia 
and the ukraine in the soviet union 
one suspect antanas gecas 73 a lithuanianborn mining 
engineer living in scotland has been identified by the british 
media he has acknowledged witnessing atrocities while serving in a 
notorious lithuanian police battalion but he says he only watched 
and is the victim of a soviet smear campaign 
the issue has deeply divided legislators opponents argued 
during tuesdays debate that prosecutions 45 years after the end of 
world war ii will turn into show trials rekindling old hatreds 
with witnesses who are unreliable because of age and bent on 
revenge 
most of the witnesses are either senile infirm or dead 
said conservative party legislator winston churchill grandson of 
britains world war ii leader this would lead to the 
establishment of show trials in this country and has no place in 
british justice 
supporters argued passionately that britain should not remain 
what several called a safe haven for monsters 
these are not crimes committed in the heat of battle said 
legislator sir bernard braine these are cases of the murder of 
noncombatants and the slaughter of whole communities of women and 
children

a house panel has launched an investigation of 
apparently contradictory methods used by the nuclear regulatory 
commission in deciding whether to allow the seabrook nuclear plant 
to open 
rep peter kostmeyer dpa chairman of the house interior 
committee oversight and investigations subcommittee notified nrc 
chairman kenneth carr of the inquiry in a letter sent tuesday 
legislators from around new england called for the investigation 
last month after the nrcs atomic safety and licensing board 
recommended that seabrook be awarded a license 
kostmeyer cited a recent dispute in which the licensing board 
downplayed concerns raised by the nrcs higher level atomic safety 
and licensing appeal board about the adequacy of new hampshire 
evacuation plans 
ron sher spokesman for new hampshire yankee electric co the 
operator of the plant for the multicompany owning consortium 
said seabrook station has been the most closely scrutinized 
nuclear plant ever licensed and in the 18year licensing history 
of seabrook intervenors have had ample opportunity to make their

the salvadoran ambassador to the united states 
says the american woman jailed after an arms cache was found at her 
san salvador apartment would probably be released if she cooperates 
with police 
ambassador miguel angel salaverria met tuesday with rep nancy 
johnson a republican from jennifer casolos home state of 
connecticut 
salaverria speaking with reporters after the briefing said 
casolo may have been unaware of arms hidden in her backyard but 
she needs to say who she rented the house from the more she 
cooperates the easier it will be to end the case 
casolo 28 went to el salvador in 1985 to work for christian 
education seminars a group dedicated to influencing us policy by 
organizing tours for americans to learn about the civil war there 
she was arrested nov 26 after police found mortar grenades

three desert motor races have been declared 
extinct a victory for environmentalists in the battle to save the 
desert tortoise 
angry offroaders said tuesday their way of life is the real 
target 
the annual barstowtolas vegas motorcycle race the johnson 
valleytoparker ariz race and scores parker 400 for all types 
of offroad vehicles will be denied operating permits 
indefinitely said ed hastey state diector for the federal bureau 
of land management 
more ravens kill tortoises than offroad vehicles retorted 
ken boyd president of district 37 of the american motorcycle 
association which oversees the popular barstowtovegas run but 
you cant control ravens its easier to dictate to people 
the tortoise was added to the nations endangered species list 
as an emergency measure on aug 4 its status will be reviewed next 
april 
weve been holding this race for 16 years and weve complied 
with every regulation of federal state county and indian tribe 
said deke houlgate a spokesman for score 
he said the organization will still stage the race but limit it 
to arizona 
jim hayes owner of a yamahasuzuki dealership in beaumont said 
he has ridden motorcycles in the california desert since 1949 and 
believes many riders wont stop because of blm rulings 
there are so many people who really love this sort of thing 
and they are going to go out and do it anyway he said 
the barstowtolas vegas race was the most popular among 
offroad enthusiasts and became the most bitterly fought of the 
three the race over the years has been battled in court by the 
sierra club the wilderness society and other groups that claim it 
damaged the environment 
the race first run in 1967 with thousands of participants was 
put on hold by the blm for seven years in 1975 it was reinstituted 
under guidelines that limited participants to 1200 
in recent years the bartowlas vegas has ended at the nevada 
border although the name remained more than 1100 participants 
rode this year 
some runnings of the thanksgiving race have seen such activist 
groups as earth first claim responsibility for mismarking courses 
and laying down tire spikes 
blm spokeswoman barbara maxfield said there were problems 
despite controls including route monitors marked tortoise burrows 
and having participants sign a statement of understanding about the 
endangered status of the tortoises 
we did find at least two burrows adjacent to the course that 
were crushed she said 
sierra club observers claimed they also saw riders leaving 
designated areas and widening corridors that should have been 
narrow passages 
to this date not one single tortoise has been injured or 
killedboyd insisted 
but as an endangered species the tortoises delicate 
environment also falls under protection 
the tortoises future became critical over the summer when the 
animals began dying of a mysterious respiratory ailment its 
survival rate already is threatened by urban sprawl and traditional 
enemies such as ravens that peck at its young 
motorcyclists say their way of life is being threatened such as 
communal gatherings of families at favorite spots for weekends 
ms maxfield pointed out tuesday that about 100 desert races 
were not affected by mondays decision motorcyclists interviewed 
said they believed it was only a matter of time 
dont close down the land said allen barbor 22 of 
palmdale most of it has been used for desert riding for 
years you really cant get there by foot so why not let 
motorcyclists enjoy it 
the wear on terrain is precisely the problem argued sierra club 
official elden hughes 
the desert is not there for everyone to destroy he said 
steve kassanyi race director for score international sponsor 
of the parker 400 called the decision unfair and said it will be 
challenged 
the ruling is bad news for barstow 100 miles northeast of los 
angeles 
attendance is an estimated 4000 to 5000 spectators for the 
race in addition to riders and support teams boosting hotel 
occupancy to 90 percent of the small desert citys 1500 hotel 
rooms

the highseas chase of a scallop boat is the 
latest episode in a maritime conflict between us fishermen and 
canada that has been aggravated by a strike among the canadian 
crews who patrol the waters 
the destroyer saguenay fired on the concordia during a 12hour 
chase off cape cod that began when canadian authorities allegedly 
spotted the boat poaching for scallops in canadian waters 
the accounts given tuesday of the confrontation between capt 
william furey jrs concordia and the saguenay varied widely there 
were no injuries and no charges were filed though canadian 
officials said they were investigating 
the episode appeared to be the most serious since 2200 members 
of the canadian fishing patrol went on strike a month ago leaving 
their territorial waters vulnerable and posing what canadian 
authorities say is a temptation for american fishermen 
the us vessel was spotted five times during several days 
poaching scallops 25 nautical miles over an international 
fisheries line said carl goodwin chief of surveillance at the 
canadian department of fisheries and oceans the line was set by 
the world court at the hague in 1984 after a long dispute between 
the two countries 
it is not our intent to harass american fishermen goodwin 
said from his halifax office were not just a bunch of cavalier 
people who are running around firing at innocent american 
fishermen 
the 366foot saguenay fired about 10 warning shots near the 
114foot concordia during the chase the two boats collided and 
each skipper accused the other of ramming his boat 
the canadian destroyer pursued the concordia from 130 miles off 
cape cod through international waters until a coast guard cutter 
picked the scalloper up early tuesday at the american 12mile 
boundary and escorted it to new bedford 
kenneth crossman a special agent with the us national marine 
fisheries service said officials boarded the scalloper in new 
bedford near the scallopers home port of fairhaven to confirm 
the captains identity and to examine the catch 
crossman said federal charges would be filed against the 
concordia only if solid evidence was presented by canadian 
officials 
furey said his charts never indicated he was in canadian 
territory he also said he and his 10member crew recharted their 
course early monday after a canadian plane flew by and ordered them 
not to move until a warship arrived 
i wasnt going to stop the vessel and wait for a warship he 
said i was fishing not at war 
furey 31 said the destroyer eventually overtook his boat and 
when he refused to stop rammed it three times 
if we had been a wooden boat wed be cut in half he said 
the crew hit the deck i shut off all the boats lights and kept 
weaving 
naval vessels have been patrolling canadian waters since crew 
from the canadian department of fisheries and oceans began a strike 
for higher wages four weeks ago 
goodwin said the strike had paralyzed much of the governments 
fishing patrol and left canadian waters vulnerable to american 
poachers who he alleged have crossed the world court line on 
almost a daily basis 
its our firm belief that those fishermen know exactly where 
the line is goodwin said it has been there for quite a while 
now and theyve been given ample time to get the necessary charts 
and chart their course properly out there

the socalled war on drugs is a failure and 
drugs from cocaine to heroin should be legalized taxed and 
dispensed by the state a federal judge says 
in his speech tuesday evening at the cosmopolitan club us 
district judge robert w sweet became the first federal judge to 
propose publicly that illicit drugs be made legal according to the 
drug policy foundation a nonprofit organization in washington 
that researches alternatives to current drug policy 
i suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition to cease 
treating indulgence in mind alteration as a crime sweet said 
more money more prisoners more addicts these numbers 
demonstrate to me our present prohibitive policy has failed flatly 
and without serious question 
among the other prominent individuals favoring legalization are 
former secretary of state george shultz baltimore mayor kurt 
schmoke economist milton friedman and conservative columnist 
william f buckley 
sweet said proverty caused the drug epidemic and drug dealing 
will continue to attract some poor people as long as potential 
profits are high 
perhaps we must ask not what can we do to eliminate drugs but 
what can we do to eliminate or at least reduce the level of 
poverty he said 
sweet a former new york deputy mayor and prosecutor and a 
trial judge in the southern district of new york for more than 11 
years said the effort to stem the drug epidemic by jailing more 
people is not working he cited a declining commitment to jobs 
education health and housing in the nation at a time when building 
jails has become a growth industry 
the enormous increase of criminal drug trials on the docket 
forces long delays in civil matters no juries were available in 
manhattans federal court in september for civil trials he said 
legalizing drugs would identify users raise revenue for 
prevention and rehabilitation and eliminate gangs and drug 
dealers sweet said 
obviously the model is the repeal of prohibition and the end 
of al capone and dutch schultz 
sweet said pharmaceutical companies could manufacture the drugs 
and the state could distribute them to addicts for less than what 
drug dealers charge with tax revenue used for research education 
and treatment of addiction 
distribution to minors should remain prohibited sweet said 
the bush administration has said legalization would create an 
unqualified national disaster by creating many more addicts 
on tuesday drug czar william bennett compared legalization 
supporters to advocates of slavery 
this is not an economic issue there were arguments made for 
slavery based on economic considerations bennett said at a news 
conference in new hampshire 
for someone to sit in a room and make an abstract bloodless 
economic argument when were looking at 200000 cocaine babies a 
year is to miss the point he said 
bennett also said he approved of taking custody away from 
addicted parents in extreme cases 
obviously you give parents you give anybody the chance to 
recover to get better bennett said in an interview but 
supposing the parent isnt getting better shows no interest in 
improving going into treatment and its adversely and 
dramatically affecting the wellbeing of the child the state can 
intervene 
bennett said most states already have legislation that provides 
for taking children away from addicts who have proven unfit to 
raise them

federal authorities investigating 
illegal bingo gambling and public corruption reportedly were 
closing in on a top state official who was in critical condition 
today after an apparent suicide attempt 
the nashville banner quoted unidentified sources tuesday as 
saying investigators were focusing on how secretary of state gentry 
crowell solicited money for political campaigns from architects 
engineers and bingo operators 
crowell 57 was found by his son brooks on the porch of his 
home in lebanon about 30 miles east of nashville police said 
crowell apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a 
38caliber revolver which was found next to him 
he left no note and authorities would not say if they had any 
leads as to his motive 
tennessee bureau of investigation agents were investigating the 
shooting to make sure no foul play was involved said deputy 
director john carney 
doctors said crowells fate depended on how well he reacts to 
swelling and infection in his brain 
neurosurgeons removed damaged brain tissue and a bullet from his 
skull during more than four hours of surgery at vanderbilt 
university medical center the gunshot wound caused a lot of 
bleeding and it destroyed a lot of tissue said john c ross the 
hospitals vice chancellor for health affairs 
its impossible to know at this time what residual damage 
there might be ross said 
the critical period now will be the next several days 
crowell has not been implicated in any wrongdoing though part 
of the investigation has clouded his office 
his former chief bingo inspector wd donnie walker 
recently began a sevenyear sentence at the federal prison in 
talladega ala the charges included extorting payoffs from bingo 
operators and crowells former assistant mary sue wright 
resigned in august before giving testimony before the us grand 
jury in memphis 
she was named an unindicted coconspirator in a memphis bingo 
operation and given immunity from prosecution she has admitted 
taking money from a democratic legislative campaign fund 
authorities said 
bingo was outlawed in tennessee this year after the state 
supreme court ruled that the game is a lottery in violation of the 
state constitution 
previously it had been legal for charity fundraising but 
reports showed that bogus charities were set up and money skimmed 
from some operations 
since january 22 people have been indicted or pleaded guilty as 
a result of the investigation they include state rep tommy 
burnett charged with conspiracy gambling mail fraud and perjury 
burnett has said he is innocent 
sen robert rochelle a democrat from crowells hometown called 
crowell a private person who didnt talk about his problems 
but rochelle pointed to the strain of news coverage in 
connection with the federal investigation 
i wish these prosecutors would quit letting people hang out 
there to try to get them to talk if they dont have enough evidence 
to convict them he said

it wasnt as dramatic as knocking down 
the berlin wall but it was another sign of the thaw in eastwest 
relations this small town has lifted its 6yearold ban on russian 
vodka 
it took six years but the city of hutchinson finally brought 
the soviet union to its knees joked barry anderson the city 
attorney 
the sanction was removed tuesday night through a unanimous voice 
vote by the city council 
it had been issued to protest the 1983 downing of a south korean 
jetliner by a soviet fighter pilot 
its not a stunt we take it seriously insisted councilman 
michael carls who is also a high school government teacher it 
was first outrage over their denial of life to those passengers on 
the jet and today its a feeling of pleasure over the extent of 
democratization over there 
the councils discussion lasted five minutes and did not end 
with a libation of vodka or any other beverage 
hutchinsons only retail liquor store is owned by the city 
carls said other us cities with municipal control over liquor 
sales banned soviet vodka after korean air lines flight 007 was 
shot down but he wasnt able to identify them 
the plane was shot down in september 1983 on a flight from 
anchorage alaska to seoul after it strayed into soviet airspace 
killing all 269 people aboard 
paul ackland mayor of this city of 10000 residents said the 
soviet embassy in washington would be informed that the vodka ban 
has been lifted 
we as a community support the changes being made and hope our 
relationship continues to improve he said 
jeanette matheny a clerk at hutchinson municipal liquor store 
said the ban stirred some discussion in 1983 but was quickly 
forgotten 
i dont even think most of the public was aware of the ban 
she said

suspected drug cartel assassins killed a 
judge a prosecutor and a bank official part of a rise in 
bloodshed as traffickers seek to stop the extraditions of narcotics 
figures to the united states 
the three slain late tuesday night were the latest victims in 
colombias 3monthold war between drug smugglers and the 
government police said 
the traffickers have said they would continue their campaign of 
bombings and assassinations unless the voters are allowed to decide 
whether to continue the policy of extraditing drug traffickers to 
the united states 
the government of president virgilio barco has said it will not 
let up on its crackdown on colombias powerful cocaine cartels 
meanwhile the colombian city of cartagena was chosen as the 
site of a drug summit in february that is expected to be attended 
by president bush 
bernard aronson assistant us secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs told a news conference in bogota on tuesday 
that the us government had accepted the caribbean port city 
about 680 miles north of bogota as an acceptable site 
presidents barco bush jaime paz zamora of bolivia and alan 
garcia of peru are to attend the summit colombia peru and bolivia 
all receive us aid that is tied to the progress of their 
antidrug efforts 
ever since barco declared an antinarcotics war after a leading 
presidential candidate was assassinated on aug 18 colombia has 
undergone a wave of killings including a bombing last week that 
claimed 63 lives 
officials also blame drug barons for the bombing of a colombian 
jetliner on a domestic flight nov 27 that killed all 107 people 
aboard 
gabriel jaime velez 38 a prosecutor who handled cases against 
suspected drug traffickers was one of the three people killed 
tuesday police said tuesday he was killed in the town of 
envigado six miles from medellin the home of the countrys most 
powerful cocaine cartel 
edgar henao 55 an engineer with the interamerican development 
bank was killed in venecia 37 miles southeast of medellin police 
said 
police said both men were killed by suspected assassins working 
for drug traffickers 
judge sofia de roldaan also was killed by suspected cartel 
assassins in the port of buenaventura on colombias pacific coast 
500 miles south of medellin police said 
the authorities could not immediately provide details on how the 
three officials were killed 
earlier this month a proposed referendum on whether colombians 
accused of crimes in other countries should be extradited was 
attached to legislation that would reform the constitution 
the house of representatives recently approved the legislation 
with the extradition rider by a vote of 109to4 bringing on 
accusations from the press that the congressmen had been bribed and 
bullied by drug traffickers 
on tuesday the legislation was in a senate commitee which was 
reluctant to introduce it to the full senate if the legislation is 
not approved by the senate by friday when the congress adjourns 
the bill would die 
the 20 committee members were not discussing the bill and no 
one wanted to suggest it be voted on the countrys two leading 
dailies el tiempo and el espectador reported 
publicly the committee was acting as if the bill did not exist

a federal appeals panel ruled that topeka is 
not doing enough to desegregate its schools since the landmark 
brown vs board of education case but a dissenting judge cited 
substantial integration 
in the majority opinion judges stephanie seymour and monroe 
mckay overturned us district judge richard rogers 1987 ruling 
that topeka schools were not responsible for lingering segregation 
because the board of education did not intend to keep the schools 
segregated 
the threejudge panel of the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
in denver released the full decision on the reopened case tuesday 
sending it back to rogers 
the original case led to a us supreme court ruling in 1954 
that set a nationwide precedent for school desegregation and busing 
cases but the parents of black schoolchildren sued 10 years ago to 
have the case reopened 
the majority opinion a reworked version of a 21 decision last 
june was accompanied by a new dissenting opinion 
today lawyers for both sides expect to receive the latest 
ruling 
seymour and mckay already had overruled rogers in june but 
judge bobby baldock didnt release his dissent then the following 
month seymour and mckay withdrew their decision without 
explanation 
lawyers speculated that they wanted a chance to respond to 
baldocks dissent 
in 1979 the parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued the 
district to reopen the brown case contending that the district had 
failed to eliminate all segregation 
among those parents was linda brown buckner who was a student 
at the time of the 1954 decision and whose maiden name heads the 
caption of the case 
rogers ruled in the reopened case that the school system had no 
intention to maintain segregated schools 
but seymour wrote rogers erred by limiting the school 
districts burden merely to showing that it had nondiscriminatory 
reasons for acting as it did as 30 years of desegregation law have 
made clear the constitution requires more than ceasing to promote 
segregation 
baldock argued the schools had done enough the school board 
has demonstrated concern for improving the racial composition in 
the topeka schools while retaining the neighborhood school concept 
in some places the two are not compatible but in this system 
substantial integration has been achieved 
rich jones an attorney for the parents who sought the cases 
reopening said lawyers will key on the dissenting opinion 
this is the first time we get to see the dissent he said 
the school district will be in a position to make a decision 
the attorney for the school district joe zima said the board 
plans to schedule a meeting early next week to consider it actions 
zima said the school district could ask all 10 judges on the 
court of appeals to hear the case ask the us supreme court to 
hear the case or go before rogers to help fashion a solution

the us postal service has violated job 
applicants constitutional rights by requiring them to undergo drug 
tests without good reason a federal judge has ruled 
a postal union official said tuesday the ruling would provide 
ammunition in the fight against a postal service policy instituted 
this year that screens prospective employees for past drug use 
we read the decision as impacting the postal services 
current drug testing program william burrus executive vice 
president of the american postal workers union said from 
washington we see it as extremely important we hope to expand 
its reach nationwide 
the case focused specifically on a research project begun in 
1986 by the postal service in which job applicants in boston 
submitted to drug tests and the results were compared with the 
employees job performance after they were hired 
in his ruling us district judge john mcnaught said the tests 
violate constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and 
seizures because the government has failed to show a compelling 
reason for testing prospective employees 
i conclude that the required urinalysis drug testing for all 
job applicants to the united states postal service without 
individualized suspicion is an unreasonable intrusion into the 
privacy of applicants and thus a violation of the fourth 
amendment mcnaught said in his decision 
james lamond the attorney representing the local american 
postal workers union in the case said the decision marked the 
first time a public sector drugtesting program for job applicants 
had been struck down by a us district judge 
gene guerrero who follows drugtesting issues for the american 
civil liberties union in washington said he was unaware of any 
other rulings against government drug testing programs for job 
applicants 
joel prosch assistant postmaster general for employee 
relations said no decision had been made whether to appeal the 
judges ruling but he stressed that the case was limited to the 
research project in boston 
according to court documents job applicants were required to 
submit to a urinalysis for drug testing starting in september 1986 
it was done purely for research purposes said karen 
intrater an attorney for the postal service it had nothing to 
do with the hiring process 
if the tests results were positive the applicants could still 
be hired and they would be monitored for absenteeism discipline 
problems and other factors 
the data collection in the study ended earlier this year but 
the results have not yet been published intrater said 
the program was challenged by the local postal carriers union 
mcnaught issued his ruling nov 21 but the decision was just made 
public this week

exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwood 
did not qualify for immunity from prosecution by reporting his 
ships grounding and oil spill and must stand trial on criminal 
charges a judge ruled 
superior judge karl johnstone said tuesday that all evidence 
gathered in the investigation except for hazelwoods report will be 
admissible at his trial for the march 24 grounding of the tanker 
and the spill of about 11 million gallons of crude oil 
hazelwood is to go on trial jan 22 for his role in the nations 
largest oil spill 
he is charged with three felony counts of criminal mischief 
plus misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment negligent 
discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
johnstone rejected arguments by hazelwoods attorneys that the 
seaman fired by exxon right after the disaster was immune from 
prosecution because of laws protecting people who report spills 
the judge who heard two weeks of testimony determined that the 
coast guards discovery of the spill would have been delayed only 
17 minutes without hazelwoods report johnstone based that 
conclusion on the testimony of a coast guard radar traffic monitor 
even without hazelwoods report the coast guard would have 
conducted substantially the same investigation that ensued 
johnstone said investigators would have arrived at the tanker at 
about the same time no matter what the source of the report he 
said 
johnstones ruling appeared to be almost a total victory for 
prosecutors who argued that the intent of the immunity provisions 
was not to protect spillers for incidents that would be discovered 
anyway 
defense lawyer richard friedman said he already is working on an 
appeal of johnstones decision 
if convicted on all counts hazelwood faces a maximum sentence 
of 11 years in prison and 106000 in fines he is the only person 
the state has charged in the oil spill

a bolivian colonel who allegedly protected cocaine 
smugglers and organized death squads with the butcher of lyon 
is being held without bond after being flown to the united states 
on drug trafficking charges 
a formal bond hearing will be held dec 26 for luis arce gomez 
who faces up to 30 years in prison on a 1983 cocaine indictment 
us magistrate william turnoff said tuesday 
arce gomez was detained at his ranch near la paz bolivia on 
sunday and spirited out of his native country on a us drug 
enforcement administration plane 
bringing arce gomez to trial is a significant strike against 
the danger posed to the united states by those who deal in 
narcotics diane cossin executive assistant to us attorney 
dexter lehtinen said after the hearing 
arce gomez was bolivias interior minister from july 1980 to 
march 1981 under a military dictatorship supported by the countrys 
major drug traffickers he was known as the minister of cocaine 
he and top aides are accused of setting up a protection racket 
that charged drug traffickers as much as 75000 every two weeks to 
look the other way and let cocaine traffic continue 
in addition human rights groups have accused arce gomez of 
running death squads that hunted down tortured and killed hundreds 
of enemies of the military government he served 
arce gomez reportedly ran the death squads with help from 
thenfugitive nazi official klaus barbie the butcher of lyon 
who later was captured and extradited to france and is now serving 
a life term for crimes against humanity 
in march 1981 arce gomez was forced out of office he fled to 
argentina in 1982 when civilian rule returned to bolivia was 
arrested in argentina after the 1983 indictment but later was 
released on a technicality 
at his hearing tuesday he wore a tshirt slacks and sandals 
and said only i understand as he was read a summary of the 
charges 
he was being represented by jose quinon one of the attorneys 
who represented colombian drug kingpin carlos lehder rivas 
sentenced last year in jacksonville to life in prison 
president bush has applauded bolivias role in arce gomez 
capture a sentiment echoed by federal law enforcement officials 
here 
it sends a message that theyre willing to go after the 
highestlevel traffickers and send them here for trial said 
richard gregorie the former top drug prosecutor in the us 
attorneys office in miami

at a news conference last week comaneci and panait told 
reporters they would live together in south florida when asked 
about a romance comaneci blushed and when a reporter wondered if 
she knew panait is married and a father she answered so what 
that remark cast comaneci in an unfavorable light with much of 
the public and with some national advertisers and has been 
highlighted repeatedly by the media 
comaneci and panait have stayed at a pompano beach hotel since 
dec 5 panait a hallandale roofer has not returned to the home 
he shared with his wife maria 25 and their children ages 2 to 6 
i dont know when i will go back home he said tuesday

everything this is all not true about a romance 
maria panait who has not seen her husband since nov 2 seemed 
surprised and relieved

a lot better but i will believe this about him being her manager 
when i hear it from him facetoface when he comes home

crooner bing crosbys son lindsay was 
battling alcoholism and depression when he found out his 
inheritance had run out and that pushed him over the edge to 
suicide a family spokeswoman said 
his body bearing a gunshot wound to the head was found monday 
at his condominium in calabasas where he was being treated for his 
drinking problem said marilyn reiss 
an autopsy to officially determine the cause of death was 
scheduled for today said bob dambacher spokesman for the los 
angeles county coroner 
lindsay 51 was the youngest of four sons born to crosby the 
legendary singer of white christmas and dixie lee crosby 
the elder crosby who also starred with bob hope in a series of 
popular road pictures died of a heart attack at age 73 in 
1977 mrs crosby died of cancer in 1952 
bing crosby married actress kathryn grant in 1957 and they had 
two boys and a girl 
ms reiss a longtime friend and publicist for lindsays brother 
gary crosby said the crosby brothers were informed on nov 30 that 
their inheritance wasnt making money anymore it was planned by 
their mother 45 years ago and was based on investments in crude oil 
the inheritance provided a regular income for the brothers 
including twins dennis and phillip 
it was not humongous but it certainly allowed all four boys to 
live comfortably ms reiss said 
gary said to me that lindsays problem is that he is too good 
and that he is a sweet kind gentle guy and maybe he should have 
been meaner because maybe he could have taken this blow ms 
reiss said 
lindsay crosby was married three times his first marriage was 
to dancer barbara frederickson he also wed secretary janey 
schwartz before marrying former miss alaska susan marlin 
his famous father was long known as one of americas preeminent 
family men but gary crosbys 1983 book going my own way 
portrayed the elder crosby as a lessthanperfect parent who was a 
stern disciplinarian 
lindsay crosby supported his brother at the time of its 
publication but had a tempered view of its revelations 
i never expected affection from my father so it didnt bother 
me he once told an interviewer

relatives of some of 248 us soldiers killed 
in an airliner crash in newfoundland four years ago are joining 
with congress members and canadian investigators in urging a us 
inquiry into the disaster 
something is obviously wrong and has been obviously wrong for 
the last four years rep robin tallon dsc said at a news 
conference following ceremonies at arlington national cemetery 
marking the crash anniversary 
tallon victims relatives and two canadian aviation safety 
board members who disagreed with a majority conclusion on the crash 
said they see a us and canadian government coverup in the 
threeyear investigation that concluded the chartered dc8 arrow 
air jetliner was downed by ice on the wings as it took off from 
gander newfoundland 
a board minority report said there was evidence of a fire and 
explosion possibly from a terrorist bomb before the dec 12 
1985 crash which killed the soldiers and eight american crew 
members 
a canadian judge earlier this year disagreed with both the board 
majority and minority conclusions but said the inquiry into 
canadas worst aviation disaster should not be reopened because 
there wasnt enough evidence left to determine the cause 
tallon is trying to get president bush and a congressional 
committee to open inquiries into the crash which has never been 
the subject of a formal us investigation 
tallon said he has been lied to about the crash by the fbi and 
the defense department which participated in the canadian 
investigation but issued no conclusions of their own 
the fbi said there was no investigation then they found a 
277page report he said the defense department said there was 
no cargo manifest then all of the sudden there was one 
there is circumstantial evidence of a coverup tallon said 
he said canadian authorities appear to have gone along with us 
defense department decisions on what was in the national 
interest 
tallon said he was not prepared to say that terrorists were 
involved but noted that the soldiers had been on a mission to the 
middle east that a proiranian group claimed credit for the crash 
and that it came at a time when it was later determined that the 
united states was involved in the irancontra affair trying to 
exchange arms for us hostages in lebanon 
dr doug phillips of st petersburg fla said his organization 
of victims families has grown from six members at the first of the 
year to 130 with renewed interest in the crash 
phillips a pathologist said examination of the bodies 
including that of his son sgt james d phillips shows evidence 
of a fire prior to the crash 
he said family members have written to bush complaining about 
the lack of a us investigation but he said none has received a 
reply 
in october 103 members of congress signed a letter to bush 
calling for a presidential inquiry saying the united states has an 
obligation to finish the investigation that was inadequately 
conducted by the canadian government tallon invited bush to the 
memorial service but the president did not attend 
les filotas and ross stephenson members of the canadian

a former army commando who 
says he was assigned to spy on antiapartheid activists in the 
netherlands has been arrested for desertion military headquarters 
said today 
the arrest came five days after an antiapartheid newspaper 
free weekly published an interview in which the former soldier 
robert carelse made detailed claims about his activities in the 
netherlands 
carelse said he was instructed by the military intelligence 
branch to live in amsterdam and infiltrate militant antiapartheid 
groups including the african national congress guerrilla movement 
and the committee of south african war resisters the netherlands 
has very active antiapartheid groups including the main office of 
the war resisters 
carelse said he went to the netherlands in july 1988 and 
returned to south africa in march while in amsterdam carelse 
reportedly stayed with his brotherinlaw keith raper a leader of 
the draft resisters committeee 
at the time of his arrest carelse was enrolled at a technical 
college in johanneburg 
the army statement said only that carelse had been arrested as a 
deserter there has been no official comment on carelses 
allegations 
security officials often boast that they have infilitrated the 
anc in neighboring african countries and elsewhere in the world 
the anc has offices in about 30 countries more places than south 
africa has embassies worldwide 
police are investigating the possibility that some members of 
the military intelligence branch may have had direct or indirect 
links with death squads alleged to have killed antiapartheid 
activists in south africa over the past 10 years

a reporter who has criticized the arizona 
attorney generals investigation of the 1976 carbomb murder of 
journalist don bolles has been slapped with a grand jury subpoena 
in an attempt to intimidate him his lawyer says 
well move to quash or limit the subpoena david bodney a 
lawyer for reporter don devereux said tuesday 
devereux was served with a state grand jury subpoena last week 
by aides to attorney general bob corbin the subpoena came days 
after devereux had published new criticisms of corbins efforts to 
find bolles killers 
the attorney general and devereux declined comment citing a 
state law that makes it a crime to disclose grand jury matters 
but bodney confirmed that his client had been subpoenaed and 
added it is devereuxs judgment that it is harassment and 
designed to intimidate 
bolles a reporter for the arizona republic died 11 days after 
a remotecontrolled bomb blew up his car 13 years ago 
devereux a freelance reporter has published stories in the 
scottsdale progress and in a private newsletter pointing to areas 
that he says corbins office has failed to pursue 
the state grand jury does not have jurisdiction over the killing 
but has been investigating conspiracy and obstruction of justice 
allegations according to documents made available to the 
associated press in october 
bodney said the subpoena did not ask devereux to bring any 
documents or specify whether he was a potential target or what the 
grand jury wants to know 
i think its improper for the attorney general to conduct a 
freewheeling examination of a reporter that will inhibit his 
newsgathering ability perhaps for all time the lawyer said 
in addition to the state and federal constitutions freepress 
guarantees arizonas shield law protects reporters from having to 
disclose their sources he said 
let the grand jury call witnesses with firsthand information 
and not interrogate reporters about their sources bodney said 
corbin a republican has come under increasing fire over the 
unsolved slaying he has not announced whether he will seek 
reelection next year 
he recently asked a judge to reinstate a murder charge against 
one of the original suspects in a move that devereux had 
criticized days before being subpoenaed as likely to be 
unproductive and a possible case of playing politics 
among those known to have been subpoenaed is neal roberts a 
phoenix lawyer who has acknowledged that he arranged for john 
harvey adamson to travel to lake havasu city hours after the 
bombing adamson a racingdog breeder was convicted of planting 
the bomb no mastermind was ever convicted and investigators have 
not established the motive with any certainty

more than 6000 vietnamese refugees 
demonstrated in three detention centers today to protest the forced 
repatriation of 51 fellow boat people a day earlier a government 
spokesman said 
a government official of this british colony meanwhile said 
the repatriation program would continue despite international 
criticism 
it is our intention to put into place a continuing program to 
return to vietnam all those who are judged not to be refugees 
chief secretary sir david ford told the legislative council his 
speech did not include a timetable for further repatriation 
the approximately 44000 vietnamese who have sailed into hong 
kong since june 1988 are considered illegal economic immigrants 
unless they can prove the fled their communist homeland fearing 
persecution 
nearly 6800 have been denied refugee status after being 
screened by immigration officials a few more than 700 have 
qualified 
the first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked 
screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police 
before dawn tuesday and put on a plane to hanoi 
vietnam has promised the returnees will be treated humanely 
the hanoi government said today that the boat people fled their 
homeland because embargoes by noncommunist nations had created 
economic problems in vietnam and because the refugees had received 
false hopes of better economic opportunity in hong kong vietnam 
condemned the forced repatriation 
the demonstrations today were peaceful and orderly as 
vietnamese marched around the camps chanting slogans and waving 
banners protesting involuntary repatriation said government 
spokesman lionel rodrigues 
local radio quoted some protesters as saying they would rather 
die in hong kong than be forced back home 
about 3000 boat people marched in hei ling chau detention 
center a former leper colony on an outlying island and another 
3000 protested at whitehead camp in the new territories about 300 
more demonstrated at chi ma wan center on outlying lantau island 
the longest demonstration lasted two hours and all were over by 
evening rodrigues said basically it wasnt very unruly they 
just marched around the compound he said 
the hong kong government argues that sending the vietnamese back 
home is more humane than keeping them indefinitely in the camps 
which are overcrowded and rife with violence and malnutrition 
but human rights organizations british opposition politicians 
and the us government have criticized the program the us state 
department expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said 
british authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those 
persons from vietnam who seek it 
ford responded to critics by saying that those who have been 
loudest in their condemnation have been slowest in bringing forward 
practical alternatives we have returned no one who in the eyes of 
the international community is a bonafide refugee 
he added we do not look for the worlds applause but we are 
entitled i feel to the worlds understanding 
hong kong and britain maintain that the territory already is 
swamped with vietnamese boat people and mandatory repatriation is 
needed to discourage another influx when the new sailing season 
begins next year 
they claim that most vietnamese now sailing into hong kong are 
not escaping persecution but only seeking a better life 
about 56000 vietnamese are housed in the colonys squalid 
camps those who arrived before june 1988 automatically were 
granted refugee status and are eligible for resettlement

the new oppositiondominated 
government today said it is drafting laws guaranteeing free 
assembly and association and freedom of religion while communists 
lawmakers debated how to pick a new president 
the proposed reforms were announced by deputy premier jan 
carnogursky a dissident lawyer who was released from jail just two 
weeks ago and on sunday was named to the first government in 41 
years led by noncommunists 
the changes in the penal code would strengthen the independence 
of the judiciary and reduce the time a person can be held in 
custody before charges are filed carnogursky said 
the presidential tussle is the latest battle for a popular 
opposition movement that in three weeks got the communists to oust 
old stalinist hardliners and relinquish the partys 41year 
monopoly on power 
under the constitution parliament must elect a president in 14 
days that would be dec 23 two weeks after hardliner gustav 
husak was forced to resign to satisfy the opposition 
some communist lawmakers want the choice to be made by public 
referendum but the opposition hoping to keep its momentum while 
it can is pressing for a quicker decision 
vasil mohorita a member of the communist politburo said 
opposition leaders agreed during negotiations tuesday that 14 days 
isnt enough time to choose a president 
many opposition figures favor vaclav havel a playwright and 
oftjailed dissident who is the emotional rallying point of the 
reform movement 
after discussions by constitutional lawyers from all parties on 
tuesday mohorita said it might take from 45 days to 60 days for an 
election to be held whether in parliament or by a vote of the 
people 
mohorita is a senior communist who negotiated with the 
opposition the coalition government chosen last week the cabinet 
was the first to make communists a minority in the government in 
four decades 
mohorita conceded that havel represents something and in no 
way can we underestimate his position in society 
what we are trying to find is the least complicated 
agreement he said he said the communists were aware that if 
mr havel was not elected by parliament that would also create 
tensions thats why were in negotations 
but havel who was being denounced as an isolated 
antisocialist dissident only a month ago is apparently difficult 
for many communists to accept as president 
central prague is plastered with posters pushing havels 
candidacy and about 500 demonstrators stood outside parliament 
shouting support for him tuesday as deputies entered the parliament 
building 
mohorita said the communists sought the quick solution to the 
impasse because we are more or less facing a constitutional 
crisis a reference to the 14day deadline the constitution 
mandates 
deputy anton blazej speaking on behalf of the communist 
deputies who dominate the 350member parliament proposed amending 
the constitution to allow for a presidential referendum within a 
month it failed to pass 
civic forum the opposition movement havel has guided through 
the past three weeks of crisis strongly rejects a referendum 
it said that although the idea seemed enticingly democratic 
it in fact would mean swiftly amending a constitution for the 
second time in less than three weeks and could lead to a 
presidential campaign leaving the country more divided than 
united 
the government instead should press ahead with free elections 
the group said in a statement then a new freely elected 
parliament would choose a new president 
we are not concerned with whether havel would have a better 
chance in parliament than in a referendum said civic forum 
spokesman lubos dobrovsky we are concerned with democracy having 
a better chance 
last week civic forum indicated there was virtual agreement 
with the communists that the president should be a czech and 
nonparty member balancing the communist premier marian calfa a 
slovak 
traditionally top posts in czechoslovakia have been divided 
between czechs and slovaks 
alexander dubcek 68 the leader of the 1968 prague spring 
reforms that were crushed by a sovietled invasion also is a 
candidate for president 
others are ladislav adamec who resigned as communist premier 
last week after failing to reach an agreement with the opposition 
and cestmir cisar a prague spring leader who like dubcek was 
expelled from the communist party in 1970 but has retained many 
socialist ideals 
husak 76 resigned sunday after swearing in a government 
containing some dissidents who were jailed because of his policies 
after the 1968 invasion 
other hardliners lost their last leadership positions tuesday 
when they resigned from the presidium that guides the parliament 
the 15 deputies who stepped down included ousted communist party 
chief milos jakes who last week also was expelled from party 
ranks and vasil bilak the communist held most responsible for the 
1968 invasion

vietnam said today that embargoes by 
noncommunist nations helped create the economic problems that 
caused many of its citizens to flee to other countries in search of 
better economic opportunity 
the commentary by the official vietnam news agency also 
reiterated the governments condemnation of hong kongs forcible 
repatriation on tuesday of more than 50 vietnamese refugees 
the policies of hostility and economic sanctions by some 
countries against vietnam over the past 10 years is one of the 
reasons causing economic difficulties in vietnam this led to the 
fact that some people fled the country said the commentary 
carried by the voice of vietnam radio and monitored in bangkok 
vietnam cannot ignore its compatriots who nurtured the 
illusion of looking for a paradise in other countries and have been 
detained in camps for years it said 
hong kong and its colonial ruler britain flew back home 51 
vietnamese from a hong kong camp tuesday in the first forced 
repatriation 
hong kong considers 44000 vietnamese who poured into the 
territory since june 1988 to be illegal immigrants seeking jobs 
not political refugees from vietnams communist regime 
vietnam always welcomes those who are willing to repatriate 
and at the same time rejects forced repatriation the commentary 
said the repatriation from hong kong including those who 
returned on dec 12 1989 are part of the framework of that 
policy 
vietnam has been largely isolated from the noncommunist world 
since north vietnam overthrew the usbacked south vietnam 
government in april 1975 triggering the boat exodus 
most noncommunist countries including japan and the united 
states imposed or continued embargoes on vietnam after its troops 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 and installed a provietnamese 
government

with the full spectrum of political opinion concerning the mutual 
future of all south africans the statement said 
mandela leader of the outlawed african national congress and 
the countrys bestknown black leader has been imprisoned since 
1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the whiteled government

and suggested he had underestimated whites desire to retain full 
political sovereignty

discrimination and extend political rights to south africas 28 
million blacks within five years

government most black leaders also demand the release of other 
security prisoners and the lifting of the 3yearold state of 
emergency before any talks begin 
mandela 71 is not likely to be released this year but 
government sources have been quoted as saying he probably will be 
freed before parliament convenes in early february

that have eased political tension 
he has permitted huge antiapartheid demonstrations ordered 
desgregation of whitesonly beaches and proposed the repeal of the 
separate amenities act which permits the segregation of many 
public facilities

upsurge in unrest related to their release and frequent appearances 
at antigovernment meetings 
mandela is held in a suburbanstyle staff residence at victor 
verster prison farm outside cape town and has been meeting 
regularly with a wide range of antiapartheid activists

the communist party today reaffirmed its 
commitment to traditional socialism and said it will still espouse 
the principles of lenin even as east germany ends oneparty rule 
and embraces democracy 
an article in the party daily neues deutschland said the 
communists also will continue to resist reunification with west 
germany 
in the detailed proposal for restructuring the party the 
communists called for a course that adheres to socialist 
antifascist pacifist and all international leftist traditions 
especially those of lenin 
the proposal is to be considered at the continuation this 
weekend of the partys special congress the session began friday 
but suspended its work after naming a new party leader reformer 
gregor gysi 
despite the reaffirmation of socialism the party leadership has 
been overhauled to remove hardliners and install reformers in an 
effort to appease the restive populace which is demanding 
democratic change and has thrown its support to the opposition 
the party will have to compete for power against a powerful 
opposition movement in may when east germany holds what are to be 
its first free and open elections the vote is set for may6 
also today the east german government expanded its cooperation 
with west germany with an agreement under which bonn will 
contribute about 540 million for 17 environmental improvement 
projects in east germany 
the agreement was announced in bonn by west german environmental 
minister klaus toepfer 
east german cities also have been appealing for food aid for 
help in preparing free elections and for advice on a range of 
reforms that have drastically changed municipal operations 
at a conference in cologne west german municipal authorities 
reported that they had been overwhelmed with calls for assistance 
from their east german sister cities 
west germany has offered massive aid to east germany on 
condition some capitalist reforms are undertaken but the 
communistled government has agreed to discuss only those 
cooperative ventures that fit into the socialist structure of the 
economy 
communist premier hans modrow and other top officials also have 
repeatedly rejected west german efforts to merge the german states 
though they have expressed interest in closer ties that benefit 
both sides 
meanwhile the opposition group new forum has filed a criminal 
complaint against former communist leader egon krenz and the head 
of the secret police force for allegedly destroying evidence needed 
in probes of corruption among ousted high party officials 
the official adn news agency reported the accusations made 
against krenz and wolfgang schwanitz the decision to seek charges 
against the two was made at a new forum meeting in leipzig 
on tuesday modrow met with secretary of state james a baker 
iii who expressed us support for the democratic reforms 
introduced in east germany 
under the rule of ousted leader erich honecker relations 
between the united states and east germany often were tense 
largely because of the berlin wall and other barriers to free 
movement that were enforced with shoottokill orders 
bakers meeting with modrow was held in potsdam where britain 
the united states and the soviet union mapped out germanys future 
in 1945 after the defeat of nazi germany 
more than four decades later east germany is undergoing its 
biggest upheaval since its founding in 1949 two sets of communist 
leaders have been ousted since oct 18 
but the growing demands for german reunification have threatened 
to split the opposition movement 
the communists are fighting for their political lives just two 
months after their ironfisted rule began crumbling still the 
communists control most of the top posts and one of the major 
opposition forces is urging modrows government to resign before 
christmas 
after meeting with modrow for an hour baker said it was 
important that reforms in east germany move forward peacefully 
and in a stable way and that this was the major political 
signal of his visit 
he spoke outside the potsdam hotel after becoming the 
highestranking us official to visit east germany in nearly two 
decades the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1974 
baker said he told modrow the united states was pleased that the 
communists and the opposition had agreed on may 6 as the date for 
free elections 
modrow 61 said east germany saw bakers visit without a 
doubt as support for the process of reforms 
this visit is a political sign that the us follows the 
developments in east germany with attention modrow said we 
started a dialogue with each other today 
modrow said his government believed this dialogue would lead 
to cooperation 
later modrow met with us house majority leader richard 
gephardt of missouri rep thomas lantos dcalif and sen robert 
kerrey dneb according to the official east german news agency

the army officer in charge of the military 
investigation into the deaths of 20 georgian nationalists in april 
has denied that troops used nerve gas to break up a rally a 
newspaper reported today 
maj gen v vasiliev defended the soldiers actions and said 
they were provoked by nationalists who pelted them with bottles and 
stones on april 9 when thousands gathered in the main square of 
tbilisi the republics capital 
nineteen people died and at least 300 people were hospitalized 
when soldiers many armed with shovels waded into the crowd to 
break up the demonstration another nationalist was fatally shot 
the night before for a curfew violation 
a civilian commission and communist party officials said two 
weeks later that an investigation showed that soldiers had used a 
poisonous incapacitating gas to disperse the rally 
vasiliev told the daily sovietskaya rossia no poisonous gases 
were used only special tear gas substances similar to those used 
by police in the west 
he said his investigation showed that 272 names of alleged 
victims of poison gas released by nationalists were false and many 
names were repeated time and time again 
vasiliev said soldiers acted in selfdefense when they attacked 
some demonstrators with shovels but that none of the victims had 
died as a result of the attack 
the majority of the people were killed in the mass commotion 
when people were horribly pressed together he said 
following the fatal rally georgian communist party chief givi 
gumbaridze told reporters that some of the victims had died from 
gas poisoning 
a full report on the incident was expected to made to the 
congress of peoples deputies during its current session in moscow

president alfredo cristiani 
says the latest central american accord strips the leftist rebels 
of any legitimacy and if they dont disband the army will deal 
with them 
the five central american presidents on tuesday demanded the 
dismantling of both the leftist farabundo marti national liberation 
front in el salvador and the usbacked contras fighting in 
nicaragua 
the twoday summit in san jose costa rica was the latest in a 
series that have raised hopes but failed to bring peace to central 
america it was the first to focus on el salvador and it renewed a 
call earlier this year for the dissolution of the contras 
the joint condemnation of both insurgencies was viewed as a 
victory for rightist cristiani as well as nicaraguas leftist 
president daniel ortega but it was also clouded by skepticism and 
suspicion 
i do not trust daniel ortega said cristiani 
neither of the rebel armies was represented at the summit and 
neither has agreed to be disbanded 
this continues to be the problem with all central american 
accords said luis sanchez sancho of the national opposition 
union a coalition that opposes nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government in elections set for feb 25 
cristiani said the five presidents had a position paper from the 
salvadoran rebels 
two of the presidents laughed others read it with dismay 
he said the impression was that it was too much gall on the part 
of the fmln after what they have done to continue trying to look 
like robin hood 
ortega said the success of the accord hinges on the cooperation 
of the united states 
washington has the main responsibility for the demobilization 
of the contras because they continue financing them and sending 
them supplies he said in a national radio and television address 
in nicaragua on tuesday 
the summit accord implicitly chides the united states the 
soviet union and cuba by saying nations with interests in the 
region should be more directly involved in the peace process the 
presidents also requested increased un involvement in the effort 
to demobilize irregular forces 
the salvadoran rebels have rejected the summit accord saying it 
does nothing to contribute to the possibility of a negotiated 
solution to the civil war they have waged for more than a decade 
against a series of usbacked governments 
the fmln cannot be demobilized by means of agreements between 
governments because it is a legitimate force with popular roots in 
the whole salvadoran territory they said in a communique 
the summit followed a sharp escalation in the salvadoran civil 
war which has claimed more than 71000 lives the rebels launched 
a huge offensive on nov 11 in which more than 1500 people 
guerrillas soldiers and civilians are estimated to have been 
killed 
the accord calls on the fmln to stop fighting and resume peace 
talks with cristianis rightist government 
with this agreement the fmln loses its room to maneuver 
said cristiani the presidents are saying to the guerrillas you 
have no right to continue violent actions 
if the fmln keeps fighting the armed forces of el salvador 
will deal with them cristiani told a news conference tuesday 
after returning from the summit 
cristiani said his government is willing to resume peace talks 
broken off by the rebels oct 31 after the bombing of a union 
headquarters but he said the fmln must cease hostilities first 
the fmln had earlier called for a ceasefire with international 
verification and recognition of territories under their control 
that position is definitely unacceptable said cristiani 
ortega said his delegation insisted on international 
verification of human rights and again criticized the salvadoran 
government for the assassination during the fmln offensive of six 
jesuit academics 
the murders have been blamed on the military 
presidents jose azcona hoyo of honduras vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala and host oscar arias of costa rica also signed the summit 
accord

the house of representatives today 
approved a bill granting further emergency powers to president 
corazon aquino to impose law and order after last weeks failed 
coup attempt 
in the senate the passage of a similar bill was blocked with 
an opposition senator warning the legislation moved the nation a 
step closer to dictatorship the senate is expected to pass a 
similar version thursday 
the bill was passed overwhelmingly on second reading in the 
lower chamber a final reading will be held thursday 
lone opposition sen juan ponce enrile who once administered 
martial law under the late ferdinand marcos denounced the 
emergency decree as a move toward dictatorship but former human 
rights lawyer sen rene saguisag defended the move in light of the 
recent coup attempt 
in a speech before the senate enrile said the emergency powers 
also could be used to extend the lease on the us military bases 
in the philippines 
defense secretary fidel ramos said today that rebel soldiers who 
launched the coup attempt dec 1 were still capable of staging 
terror attacks and assassinations although they surrendered their 
last stronghold saturday 
ramos told a news conference the government will no longer seek 
us air cover over philippine territory 
us jets flew over rebelheld bases to discourage more bombing 
runs on the malacanang presidential palace and the us help 
turned the tide in favor of the government on the first day of the 
mutiny 
the cabinet also was told that the business community is looking 
for signs the government will move decisively to address the 
political social and economic damage wrought by the sixth and 
bloodiest attempt so far to oust mrs aquino share prices on the 
manila stock exchange fell for the third consecutive day since 
trading resumed after the coup attempt 
on dec 6 mrs aquino declared a nationwide state of emergency 
but officials said the legislation would give her further powers 
the house and senate versions of the emergency bill grant mrs 
aquino the power to order the search for weapons and ammunition in 
private homes without the normal legal constraints 
the house voted against allowing mrs aquino to intervene in 
labor disputes and suspend labor laws which may impede production 
a majority of the 23member senate voted to keep the provision 
regarded by critics as a strike ban 
both versions allow mrs aquino to take over public utilities 
such as privatelyowned transportation firms if they violate 
national policy 
the house bill limits mrs aquinos emergency powers to a 90day 
period while the senate version extends it up to six months

kidnappers today freed a senior cabinet 
ministers daughter they had held for six days after the government 
met their demand and released five jailed moslem militants 
officials said 
rubaiya sayeed 22 was released two hours after the prisoners 
went free thereby ending the first crisis of the 12dayold 
government of prime minister vp singh staterun television 
reported 
the chairman of the militants organization warned of future 
kidnappings unless the government behaves 
the television flashed a news bulletin saying rubaiya sayeed 
freed interrupting a cricket match between india and pakistan 
ms sayeeds father is home minister mufti mohammad sayeed she 
was kidnapped at gunpoint on friday in srinagar the summer capital 
of jammukashmir state and a popular tourist resort and the 
separatist kashmir liberation front claimed responsibility 
militants had threatened to kill ms sayeed a medical intern 
unless their five jailed comrades were freed the release followed 
haggling over the site of the swap and the safety of the prisoners 
the five were released at an undisclosed site in the city 
culminating five days of negotiations between the government and 
the front said the police officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
about two hours after the militants were released a dazed ms 
sayeed was dropped at a friends house and then taken to her home 
later she was to be flown to new delhi for a reunion with her 
family 
by the grace of the almighty and the blessings of millions of 
my countrymen rubaiya has a new lease on life a relieved sayeed 
said after hearing his youngest daughter was safe our ordeal of 
anxiety and agony has ended their prayers and good wishes have 
restored our child to us 
sayeed unshaven but smiling and wrapped in a brown shawl 
condemned his daughters captors 
there is no bravery in attacking a girl it is cowardly you 
dont need guns and swords to attack a girl he said they have 
lost the sympathy of the people in the state in india and the 
world 
among the freed militants was abdul hamid sheikh a top leader 
in the kashmir liberation front police said sheikh who was 
arrested last month after being wounded in a clash with police was 
taken by ambulance from a srinagar hospital to the site and turned 
over to his organization 
the other four were identified as noor mohammad kalwal mohammad 
altaf bhat sher khan azad and javed ahmed zargar officials said 
all had been arrested on suspicion of subversive activities during 
the past year but no charges had been filed 
as news of the swap spread throughout the city 3000 people 
filled the streets setting off firecrackers waving pakistan flags 
and shouting antiindia slogans 
in pakistan amanullah khan chairman of the militants group 
said india had made a wise step and he hoped the government 
would adopt a similar wise attitude toward the future of kashmir 
and leave kashmir honorably instead of waiting until it is shunted 
out and humiliated by kashmiri freedom fighters 
asked whether the swap would encourage the front to launch a 
campaign of kidnappings to secure its demands khan said it 
depends on how the indian government behaves because they 
compelled us to take this step 
the kashmir liberation front which wants jammukashmir to 
either become independent or part of islamic pakistan commands a 
large following in the moslemdominated srinagar 
the front formed in 1965 has often attacked the government and 
sponsored successful strikes in jammukashmir the only moslem 
majority state in the predominantly hindu india 
at indias request the government of pakistan had appealed to 
the militants not to harm ms sayeed 
moslems make up 64 percent of the states 5 million people but 
comprise just 11 percent of indias 880 million people hindus 
account for about 80 percent of the population 
kashmir is claimed both by india and pakistan and the two 
countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining 
independence from britain in 1947 
in a bid to halt the separatism the new prime minister 
appointed sayeed a kashmiri as head of a cabinet committee on 
jammukashmir and neighboring punjab where sikh militants also are 
demanding an independent homeland 
sayeed is the first moslem to be named indias home minister a 
key post that oversees the countrys internal security the 
appointment was seen as part of singhs efforts to appease moslems 
who have borne the brunt of hindumoslem religious riots that 
claimed more than 300 lives this fall singh is a hindu

the bush administration is considering lifting 
a ban on satellite exports to china continuing to chip away at 
sanctions imposed on beijing after its violent crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
president bush did not intend to disrupt normal civilian 
commercial relations when he barred military exports to china 
last spring and officials are reviewing the sanctions with that in 
mind white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
bush today refused to reply during a photo session when asked if 
he was prepared to lift the ban on satellite transfers 
the news from the white house brought condemnation from rep sam 
gejdenson dconn chairman of house foreign policy subcommittee 
on international economic policy and trade he said the idea of 
lifting the sanction on satellites makes no sense whatsoever 
in china where the government has only tightened the screws 
the bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to 
try to do to help the chinese government gejdenson said 
last weekend national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger went to beijing to 
explore the possibility of resuming relations with china the trip 
an exception to the presidents ban on highlevel contacts with 
china also drew sharp criticism from congressional democrats 
asked about the trip today during a photo session with bush 
scowcroft told a reporter only that it was long 
a third administration official white house personnel director 
chase untermeyer joined the duo on the china trip to make personal 
contacts for the president the white house said 
untermeyer confirmed that he went and said he also had 
accompanied bush to china in 1977 and 1982 he said he spoke last 
weekend with us officials there regarding personnel matters but 
did not elaborate 
white house spokesman steve hart said untermeyers main mission 
was to speak to two chinese friends of bush who served as liaison 
officer then the highestranking us representative in beijing 
in 197475 
hart said untermeyer purpose was simply to hear their thoughts 
about the changes going on in china since the tiananmen square 
massacre last spring one of bushs chinese friends is a midlevel 
government official and the other is a former member of the 
governent hart said 
the hughes aircraftmanufactured communications satellites fall 
in the category of items on the governments sensitive munitions 
list that were automatically included in the suspension us 
officials said 
no decision has been made but it is possible those 
satellites will be freed for delivery fitzwater said 
two of them are under hughes contract to a joint 
australianchinese venture and the third are for a britishchinese 
consortium in hong kong he said china will launch the satellites 
for the australian firm aussat and the hong kong consortium 
asiasat 
australia has been pushing for a waiver and has received 
indications the administration will make a decision in its favor by 
the end of the year said australian embassy political counselor 
roger uren 
we have made it clear this is important to us we have a sense 
the americans understand he said tuesday we basically get a 
positive sense 
one of australias satellites is to be launched in april and the 
others in 1991 and 1992 while the britishchinese one is to go up 
on a chinese launch vehicle in april 
licenses for export had been granted for all three satellites 
before the sanctions were imposed the state department advised 
hughes it would consider a request for an exemption from the 
suspension but there has been no decision said hughes spokesman 
don oneal 
bush imposed sanctions on june 5 in the wake of beijings attack 
that killed hundreds of tiananmen square protesters 
the order included a ban on export of weapons and military 
equipment satellites and nuclear supplies as well as suspension 
of any loans to china from the world bank and the asia development 
bank 
since then the administration has allowed export of five boeing 
jetliners whose guidance system was on the us munitions control 
list of sensitive technology boeing spokesman randy harrison said 
the government ultimately agreed that the planes navigation device 
was for civilian use and could not be removed for military use 
without being obvious 
the administration also has permitted chinese engineers to 
resume work in the united states on a 500 million program to 
upgrade chinese f8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronics 
equipment the white house said no planes were to be delivered in 
accordance with the ban on military exports 
the administration is looking for signs of change in chinese 
repressive policies before normalizing relations he said 
there has been no change in the deferral of 957 million in 
world bank loans and 336 million in asian development bank loans 
said fitzwater

premier nikolai i ryzhkov spurning the demands 
of progressives offered an economic reform plan today that 
continues the ban on private property and generally maintains 
central control of the economy 
the 2250member congress interrupted the premiers nearly 
twohour speech with applause only once about half the deputies 
clapped when ryzhkov declared that the state is the owner of the 
means of production 
ryzhkov claimed he was offering a radical reform for carrying 
the economy out of a crisis food and consumer goods are in 
painfully short supply and authorities now wonder if they will 
have enough fuel to heat soviet apartments through the long winter 
ryzhkovs speech displeased progressives who pushed 
unsuccessfully on tuesday to have the congress take up legislation 
to liberalize private property ownership and to consider lifting 
the communist partys monopoly on power 
such deputies insist that communist ideology must be divorced 
from economic policy if the country is to pull itself out of a 
grave economic crisis 
five years ago we said it was a choice between fiveyear 
plans and perestroika and unfortunately it turns out the 
fiveyear plan has won said economist and parliamentarian pavel 
bunich in the lobby outside the snowcovered kremlins palace of 
congresses 
president mikhail s gorbachev successfully defeated attempts to 
address such broad ideological questions and got the agenda he 
wanted for the 10day congress that opened tuesday a focus on the 
governments economic reform program known as perestroika 
but ryzhkovs speech appeared more conservative than the reform 
plan unveiled last month by his deputy leonid abalkin that plan 
called for urgent measures to lift state controls on some prices 
sell off some unprofitable state enterprises and lay the groundwork 
for a type of stock market 
ryzhkov spoke at length about developing a socialist market 
economy that the state would control but he gave few details 
he offered no specific proposals on letting market forces 
dictate prices which are artifically low because of state 
subsidies on many goods 
because of consumer fears that easing price controls will result 
in exorbitant prices the government will discuss compensation for 
price increases beginning next year and only afterwards draft the 
reform he said 
the premier also said the government would begin relying less on 
centralized planning in a second stage of reform beginning in 1993 
but his report appeared to contain nothing to give soviets an 
incentive to work efficiently 
we have to leave free to the market only that part of 
production that would not lead to unbalancing the economy 
ryzhkov said 
the official tass news agency said ryzhkov rejected demands for 
private property ownership 
he repeated previously announced plans to shift more production 
from heavy industry to consumer goods and to improve technology 
the reforms that gorbachev began when he rose to power in 1985 
are now being outpaced by changes in other east bloc nations in 
other developments in the region 
czechoslovak communists and leading opposition leaders in 
prague debated the process and time frame for naming a new 
president which is expected to be leading dissident vaclav havel 
east germanys overhauled communist party said it would adhere 
to socialist principles despite the prodemocracy reforms advocated 
by the opposition the party is positioning itself as an 
alternative to the opposition for free elections that are to be 
held in may 
in moscow many progressives said the government should instead 
of releasing yet another economic report offer specific 
legislation that the congress could immediately take up 
they also criticized the ruling communists for refusing to back 
the legalization of private property which many economists 
consider crucial to ending chronic consumer shortages and 
industrial inefficiency 
if we want a free economy free from unnatural influence let 
enterprises be enterprises without any ideological violence over 
them said one deputy sergei stankevich 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov who had called for a 
twohour general strike monday to press for elimination of the 
communists constitutionally guaranteed leading role urged the 
congress on tuesday to take up all parts of the soviet constitution 
that inhibit economic reform 
but gorbachev on tuesday dismissed that idea as too general and 
cut him off when he tried to elaborate 
in a series of key tests on the opening day of the congress 
moves to broaden the debate were shot down a bid to put the 
communist partys constitutional status on the agenda did best 
it received 839 votes but 1138 deputies voted against it 
yevgeny yevtushenko one of the countrys bestknown poets called 
the result a noble defeat because 87 percent of the deputies 
are communist party members

the top department of housing and urban 
development officials in los angeles and new orleans are resigning 
after refusing transfers ordered by hud secretary jack kemp as part 
of an agency management shakeup 
also affected by a flurry of personnel moves in recent weeks are 
a onetime assistant to former hud secretary samuel pierce jr the 
former heads of huds baltimore and richmond va offices the 
agencys top official in oklahoma city and its no 2 official in 
chicago 
none of the moves have been announced publicly but a hud 
spokesman in los angeles confirmed tuesday that benjamin bobo is 
resigning as head of that office and will be replaced in february 
by charles ming now the oklahoma city manager los angeles with 
234 workers is huds largest field office 
bobo submitted his resignation effective feb 20 after 
declining kemps offer that he take over the new orleans office 
reed said 
two hud sources in washington speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the current new orleans hud manager richard 
franco told kemp he would resign rather than accept a transfer to 
become head of huds newark nj office attempts to reach franco 
late tuesday were unsuccessful and the effective date of his 
resignation could not be determined 
kemp has said he would replace hud managers he did not believe 
were performing adequately or did not respond aggressively to his 
efforts to rid the agency of mismanagement and influencepeddling 
the subject of recent congressional hearings focusing largely on 
pierces tenure 
the transfer offers to bobo and franco are examples of kemp 
using his power to send more than adequate signals of his 
displeasure said one source the jobs offered to bobo and franco 
are regarded within hud as demotions and would have required them 
to make longdistance moves just before the december holidays 
ted britton jr who under pierce headed an office of 
international affairs accepted the newark job after franco turned 
it down the sources said kemp had abolished the international 
affairs office and reassigned britton to another headquarters job 
the new orleans job has been offered to george t ray jr 
currently the no 2 official in huds chicago office but he has not 
yet indicated whether he will accept the sources said 
the oklahoma city job has yet to be offered and hud also is 
looking for a new manager for its baltimore office 
st george crosse a maryland republican appointed to head that 
office two years ago after he lost a congressional race began 
working at hud headquarters in washington this week after he lost a 
bid to keep his job kemp was unhappy with the management of the 
baltimore office the sources said 
the former richmond office manager g william thomas has been 
given a second temporary reassignment after being removed from his 
post three months ago because of kemps displeasure with the 
offices operation 
kemp first dispatched thomas to charleston wva for a 120day 
temporary assignment and now has demoted him three civil service 
grades and sent him to pittsburgh for a threemonth stint as a hud 
loan officer 
bobo was criticized last year in an office of government ethics 
report that found hud executives violated conflict of interest 
rules by raising money from private contractors to pay for a fair 
housing campaign that was a pet project of pierce bobo was singled 
out for raising 15000 from a local board of realtors to help pay 
for the campaign 
bobo 44 came to hud headquarters at the beginning of the 
reagan administration and has headed the los angeles office since 
1984 
his replacement ming 60 is an attorney who was appointed 
manager of the oklahoma city office in february 1984 that office 
has been deeply involved in widespread federal housing 
administration mortgage fraud investigations 
attempts to reach bobo and ming were unsuccessful calls to bobo 
were referred to reed and calls to mings office late tuesday went 
unanswered 
it was not immediately clear why kemp was unhappy with francos 
performance although one of the sources said there were a lot of 
political problems down there calls to francos office late 
tuesday were unanswered

skubiszewski and gyula horn his hungarian counterpart said their 
countries were creating marketoriented economies 
also they said they soon will conclude talks with the 
international monetary fund for financial rescue packages that 
would free extra western loans and help in easing their huge 
foreign debts 
in return the imf insists that both countries must adopt sound 
economic policies 
one of our most important aims is to shape a healthy 
enterprise structure horn told the foreign ministers of the 
donor nations including the united states the 12 european 
community countries japan canada and australia

economy by opening wider the doors to free enterprise 
hungary and poland have been at the forefront of the democratic 
changes reshaping eastern europe poland has the east blocs first 
noncommunist premier and hungary has opened its borders promised 
multiparty elections and formally disbanded the communist party 
sources said both east european officials were questioned by 
several delegations about details of their economic reform programs 
and the measure of support they have in warsaw and budapest 
the meeting was the first between secretary of state james baker 
iii and his 23 counterparts since president bush and other world 
leaders suggested an aid program for eastern europe at a summit 
meeting in paris in july 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama said today the talks 
were of great significance 
it is extremely important to remove the economic hardships 
which confront poland and hungary and to enhance the smooth 
implementation of the economic reconstruction and development so 
that budding reform in the two countries will develop unimpaired 
and finally bear fruit 
nakayama said his government was prepared to offer 150 million 
to an economic stabilization fund for poland as soon as the warsaw 
government reaches an agreement with the imf 
the european community was put in charge of coordinating the aid 
program the leaders recommended the financial help as a way of 
encouraging the drive in those east european countries for more 
open political systems and marketoriented economies

the ruling communist party today decided 
to ask parliament to formally abolish the partys monopoly on power 
by repealing constitutional clauses guaranteeing party supremacy 
state media said 
also today the party expelled longtime leader todor zhivkov 
along with his son and a close associate the state bta news agency 
reported 
the developments which came on the third day of a key session 
of the communist party central committee are in line with new 
leader petar mladenovs stated goal of reforming the party and 
democratizing society 
they also are in line with the rapid changes under way elsewhere 
in the east bloc in czechoslovakia and east germany the communist 
party has lost its constitutional guarantee of supremacy and in 
poland the party lost its supremacy in elections 
the state news agency bta said the communist partys 
parliamentary committee planned thursday to introduce a motion to 
abolish two constitutional paragraphs one establishes the party as 
the leading force in society and in the state and the other 
says the party heads the construction of an advanced socialist 
society

replaced as party leader nov 10 and removed from the ruling 
politburo shortly afterward 
also expelled were zhivkovs son vladimir and milko balev a 
longtime zhivkov associate said bta in its oneline dispatch 
since his removal from power the 78yearold zhivkov who led 
the country for more than 35 years has come under increasing 
attacks in the state media for alleged corruption and mismanagement 
his son vladimir said to have enjoyed an opulent lifestyle 
during his fathers tenure was removed from his job at the central 
committees culture department less than two weeks after his father 
was toppled from his positions as party chief and state president 
the central committe and politburo have been purged repeatedly 
since new party chief petar mladenov took power and embarked on a 
course of reform similar to that under way in other east bloc 
countries 
also today peter dyulgerov the head of the official trade 
unions resigned from the ruling politburo he was seen as a 
holdover from the zhivkov regime 
in an effort to appease bulgarias growing prodemocracy 
movement mladenov has largely revamped the politburo by bringing 
in new people more likely to embrace reform 
dyulgerov reportedly said he was resigning as president of the 
trade unions because they had recently declared their independence 
from party domination it was not clear whether he remained on the 
policymaking central committee 
thousands of bulgarians held a candlelight vigil outside party 
headquarters tuesday evening to emphasize their call for political 
change 
several speakers denounced zhivkov and accused the old 
leadership of economic and political blunders 
politburo member alexander lilov repeated earlier calls for the 
punishment of zhivkov and his closest associates and questioned 
how the system could allow dictators to rule so long zhivkov 
had been in power since 1954 
mladenov proposed monday that the party relinquish its 
consitutional monopoly on power and open dialogue with independent 
groups he also proposed that free elections be announced by may 
1990 
also tuesday the head of the sofia city committee georgi 
grigorov likened the communist party to a sinking ship with a crew 
beheaded by decades of hardline rule he said the party was 
beheaded in terms of personnel 
who are the young economists who are the professionals who 
are our ideologists grigorov asked according to the state news 
agency bta which carried excerpts from the closeddoor session 
maybe we have these young people but all of them were molded 
in a similar way he said we put all of them on our ship 
which is sinking 
boiko dimitrov who replaced mladenov as foreign minister last 
month suggested that some people in the central committee still 
linked to the zhivkov government should resign 
evgeni alexandrov a central committee member and party 
spokesman told a news conference that it was more important that 
the communist party members realizethat we are living in a 
different age and elect a central committee that would act on that 
reform policy 
he said several of the more than 30 speakers who took the floor 
tuesday criticized zhivkovs rule and the administrative 
bureaucratic system that allowed it others he said supported 
mladenovs call for dialogue with independent groups

more than a dozen reports of problems with rudder 
controls on boeing 737s have been made since a plane skidded off a 
new york airport runway with such a problem two federal agencies 
say 
the federal aviation administration and the national 
transportation safety board said tuesday they have asked the boeing 
co to provide data on any reports it has received before or since 
the new york accident on rudders set in unexpected positions on its 
737300 and 737400 model jets 
the faa will use the information to decide whether to order any 
action such as a design change or modification said faa spokesman 
david duff in seattle 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz in washington dc said the 
agency had received at least a dozen reports two involving foreign 
airlines of instances where the crew says it discovered the 
rudder was trimmed in a way that they didnt expect 
the faa has looked into the incidents to try to determine if 
the cause was related to human factors or a mechanical problem or a 
combination of both duff said 
the inquiries are limited to the boeing 737300 and 737400 
models because they have electrically driven controls earlier 
737100 and 737200 models have manual cranks 
ntsb investigators found that the rudder was improperly set on a 
usair jet trying to take off from laguardia airport on sept 20 
the 737400 veered on the runway and the crew aborted takeoff but 
the plane skidded into the east river the plane broke into three 
pieces and two passengers were killed and 45 injured 
the investigations will look into whether a crew member 
inadvertently activated the rudder switch and examine the cockpit 
gauge that indicates how the rudder is set duff said 
boeing commercial planes spokesman dick schleh said the firm is 
compiling the data for investigators

argus leader sioux falls sd on the philippines 
philippines president corazon aquino appears to have survived 
another coup attempt the sixth and most serious one she has 
endured since taking office four years ago 
this time it took us intervention to help her through the 
us responded properly but in the long run intervention may 
prove to be the catalyst that finally altered relations between the 
united states and the philippines 
the united states would be wise to step up plans to move its two 
important military bases from the philippines subic bay naval base 
and clark air base 
subic bay and clark are the largest us bases on foreign soil 
and are of strategic importance in the southeast asia region 
however the bases are also becoming increasingly unpopular with 
filipinos 
aquinos recent actions will no doubt make the bases even more 
unpopular in the philippines 
at aquinos request us jets flew air cover for loyalist 
philippine forces the move helped prevent insurgents from 
continuing their own air strikes and taking over aquinos 
government 
us fighter planes did not fire on rebel troops but just the 
fact the us warplanes threatened philippines people enraged many 
filipinos 
president bush and vice president quayle responded quickly and 
properly to aquinos request 
the united states helped preserve a democratically elected 
government and in doing so also protected us military 
interests but aquino had to have been desperate to make such an 
extreme request

star tribune minneapolis on drug wars 
heres the way colombias troubles on such horrendous display 
lately ought to get resolved 
an avianca airliner is blown up at the direction of a cocaine 
cartel drug lords are probably behind the carbombing that 
shredded national police headquarters and surrounding buildings in 
bogota president virgilio barco pledges to keep fighting the 
cartels colombians having lived under democracy most of this 
century resoundingly support the government the cartels crumble 
unfortunately the happy ending is wishful thinking violence on 
a grand scale has visited colombia periodically as in the 1950s 
when hundreds of thousands died it could return and the cocaine 
trade enriches colombias economy while prices for coffee its 
leading export have fallen 
the lesson is familiar the best way for the united states to 
help colombia fight its drug war is to cut drug demand at home

the seattle times on auto insurance 
a long road through the courts lies ahead but a ruling by 
the california insurance commissioner is an overdue stab at the 
inequities that permeate the auto insurance rate jungle 
under the ruling a california drivers address gender or 
marital status no longer can be considered by insurance companies 
when setting rates 
there is something intrinsically wrong in assumptions that a 
single or divorced woman is a less responsible driver than a 
married woman and should pay a higher rate or that men are worse 
than women drivers or that a zip code alone makes a driver a 
higher risk 
blanket rating by gender and marital status is as unconscionable 
as rating by race 
while outlawing the socalled zip code rating the ruling 
said insurers can consider population density traffic density 
medical costs and litigation rates when establishing auto rates 
that makes sense insurers argue all those things are factored into 
zipcode ratings but it doesnt always work out that way 
insurance ratesetting is grossly unfair to too many people the 
industry argues it works fairly well for most the ruling sends a 
needed message thats not good enough

the bulletin bend ore on the atv industry 
consumer safety advocates are feigning surprise and outrage at 
the results of an undercover survey which found that more than half 
of allterrain vehicle dealers violate an agreement that they not 
pitch adultsize machines as being safe for youngsters under the 
age of 16 
the government was asking for this trouble when it announced an 
illconsidered consent decree with atv manufacturers in 1988 the 
agreement required atv distributors to use their best efforts 
to assure that dealers do not sell adultsize atvs for use by 
children 
the decree was based on the flawed assumption that manufacturers 
could force atv salesmen to dissuade adults from buying the 
machines for youngsters 
the fact is the muchballyhooed consent decree signed a year ago 
is an ineffective way to ensure that young people do not end up on 
fullsize atvs if the government truly believes these fourwheeled 
vehicles are inherently dangerous for young people then it should 
make it illegal for those under the age of 16 to drive the machines

the leafchronicle clarksville tenn on the congressional pay 
raise 
the nearly 40 percent pay raise that members of the house voted 
themselves in the waning days of the 1989 session probably wont be 
much of an election issue next year 
thats because the chairmen of the democratic and republican 
parties as well as the congressional committee chairmen from each 
party signed a nonaggression agreement in part the bipartisan 
pact reads 
the four of us have agreed to issue instructions to our staffs 
that the vote on hr 3660 the pay raise is not an appropriate 
point of criticism in the coming campaigns further we will 
publicly oppose the use of this issue in any campaign in the 1990 
cycle 
in other words challengers to a house seat who had hoped to 
make an issue of their opponents vote for a pay raise will be 
strongly urged by their own parties not to do so 
this accommodating attitude between the two parties leads one to 
wonder if the political cynics arent correct there no longer are 
two distinct parties in washington theyve been replaced by one 
large group of incumbents whose primary aims are to keep getting 
elected and reaping as many benefits as they can from the taxpayers

outraged public feels hard pressed to come up with a central 
villain 
m danny wall will serve in that role for now but we should

as for other key villains lets start with rhode islands own 
fernand st germain who as chairman of the house banking committee 
pushed through legislation raising bank and sampl deposit 
insurance to 100000 per account that gave sampl operators a big 
riskless treasure chest of capital with which to gamble 
then we have president reagans onetime chief of staff donald

of the us league of savings institutions all acted to protect

delta democrattimes greenville miss on helping people get 
homes 
president bushs plan to assist the homeless lowincome 
families and firsttime buyers is in far too many respects more 
of the same from washington throwing money at a perceived problem 
under the assumption that only government has the solution 
nonetheless his 7 billion home ownership and opportunity for 
people everywhere hope makes sufficient nods in the direction of 
selfhelp and market concepts to make the plan palatable 
one of the programs more farsighted elements could enable 
millions of renters to become homeowners about 1 billion would be 
made available for tenants to convert and rehabilitate federally 
subsidized housing into residentowned cooperatives 
the best element of the plan would provide vouchers to 
lowincome families to help them escape from public housing 
projects and find living quarters more suitable to their needs 
encouraging families with initiatives to solve their own housing 
problems makes infinitely more sense than condemning them to grim 
federal projects 
clearly hope is not meant as a cureall for the nations 
housing problems but on balance it is a positive step in 
addressing those problems in ways that encourage inividual and 
collective enterprise

the phoenix gazette on aids and civil liberties 
its been said that aids is the first politically protected 
disease in history there is some truth in that statement 
concern for the civil liberties of aids victims is appropriate 
but it ought not to be the central issue nor should it stand in 
the way of warning people at risk 
it is difficult to understand how the spread of the disease can 
be contained when no one including those who are infected knows 
who is carrying the hiv virus 
some officials admit the problem and encourage voluntary testing 
to control the spread of the disease unfortunately voluntary 
testing has limited effectiveness for example a study at bellevue 
hospital in new york revealed that voluntary hospital screening 
missed more than 85 percent of pregnant women infected with the 
deadly virus 
the fastest growing population of hivinfected individuals is 
iv drug users in innercity minority populations 
perhaps it would be more useful to policymakers if the 
recommendations were put in order of priority

lest anyone think communism is dying cuban president fidel 
castro has declared that the demise of communist rule in eastern 
europe will mean a shift of global alliances 
castro predicted the stalinist regimes of china north korea and 
vietnam will join cuba to uphold orthodox communism 
that boast may be only a product of castros exaggerated 
selfimportance but the fact remains that while the soviet union 
is allowing communisms strength to be sapped in eastern europe it 
continues to subsidize cuba and the marxist government in nicaragua 
to the tune of more than 6 billion a year

las cruces nm sunnews on communism 
a poll says half of all americans think communism has failed and 
is now on its deathbed 
we think that possibly they may be half right marxism is 
generally regarded as a failure but what we perceive as the evils 
of the communist system could persist under any number of new names 
we should never forget that rivalries among nations spring from 
deeper causes than ideology the nations of europe have been 
warring for years over territory and economic advantage communism 
was no more than a radical pipedream when the nations of europe 
blundered into world war i national antipathies and rivalries 
brought that on and many of the same rivalries and antipathies 
exist today 
it is only human to expect that every favorable development on 
the international scene means the millennium is being ushered in 
but history tells us not to expect it history tells us that world 
powers always tend to collide when their interests conflict we 
must never lose hope but we must never expect too much 
complacency such as that reflected in the poll could prove to be 
our worst enemy

when mikhail s gorbachev met with pope john paul ii in the 
vatican many commentators recalled joseph stalins facetious 
remark to winston churchill how many divisions does the pope 
have 
yet the historic encounter between the head of the roman 
catholic church and the leader of the international communist 
movement signified more than an acknowledgment by gorbachev 
that the popes power cannot be measured in military terms 
gorbachev cannot even should he wish to rule through terror 
like stalin it is too late for that he must respond to the 
beliefs of the people of the soviet union 
his predecessors were forced to come to an accommodation with 
the russian orthodox church based on the latters subservience 
gorbachev has had to come to an agreement with the pope that 
acknowledges the spiritual power of the catholic church 
the soviet leader will also have to come to an accommodation 
with the other divisions of religion under the banner of islam as 
well as christianity as the world witnesses not the death of god

los angeles daily news on defense spending 
in anticipation of an enormous peace dividend from improved 
superpower relations members of congress have already begun laying 
plans for allocating the tens or even hundreds of billions of 
dollars that are expected to be saved on defense the idea is to 
shift the windfall to domestic programs from education to the war 
on drugs 
congress in its eagerness to fatten politically popular 
domestic programs may cut too much from defense and leave american 
forces dangerously weakened in a world that still has its dangers 
whatever happens in eastwest relations 
to prevent a weakening of americas defenses both president 
bush and congress need to keep three important points in mind 
cut troops before anything else but maintain enough strength 
to protect american interests for example cutting the 21 
million activeduty personnel by 20 percent 420000 troops 
would save about 125 billion alone in fiscal 1994 
dont be in a rush to weaken americas strategic capability 
 
despite the soviet unions paring of conventional forces its 
massive nuclear arsenal remains largely intact the united 
states should avoid excessively deep cuts because nuclear systems 
tend to be a relatively cheap form of security 
dont cut research and development the rampd portion of the 
defense budget less than 5 percent is arguably the best defense 
investment the taxpayers can make even as bush and congress agree 
to slash procurement for this and that weapon system they must 
make sure not to jeopardize americas lead in the technology of 
warfare

watertown wis daily times on medical research 
a study published in the journal of the american medical 
association is being hailed for showing for the first time 
scientifically that being fit helps women live longer in addition 
the study on the lives of 10244 men and 3120 women who have 
been followed for eight to 18 years was called persuasive 
confirmation of earlier ones 
on review the figures and conclusions seem unimpressive of the 
13444 enrolled for investigation between 1970 and 1981 by 
epidemiologist steven blair of the institute of aerobics research 
in dallas only 283 have so far died thats a death rate of 212 
per 1000 
it is not a large enough figure compiled over a long enough time 
to demonstrate that those least fit regardless of how this is 
defined are for men at 240 percent greater risk of dying and for 
women 360 percent than those most fit in the long run 
agreed that this is true for the sample tested nonetheless it 
pushes statistics to the limits to say as does william haskell 
this is a major study in 20 years it may be but not yet 
dr haskell a cardiologist at the stanford university school of 
medicine and an expert in exercise physiology acted as a 
consultant to the aerobics institute 
fads exist in medical research as in other fields we have an 
impression that this is true of exercise physiology exercising and 
keeping fit are certainly important but other things in medicine 
as well as in our culture and society are even more so

president bushs son neil said he was never 
asked to use his influence with regulators and would never have 
agreed to do so in his three years as director of a colorado 
savings and loan that has since collapsed 
a former federal bank regulator charged last week that 
government officials delayed closing silverado savings and loan 
largely because the younger bush was on the board of the 
denverbased thrift 
but neil bush who resigned from the board last year says he 
was never asked to influence regulators according to todays san 
francisco chronicle 
nor would i have if i had been asked he said 
last week james moroney a former staff analyst for the federal 
home loan bank of topeka which supervised silverado said bushs 
presence was a material part of unconscionable delays in taking 
over silverado 
however moroney said he has no evidence that bush exerted 
direct pressure for preferential treatment 
asked if he thought his presence on silverados board influenced 
regulators bush said i wouldnt know you would have to ask 
regulators about that 
bush 34 stepped down from silverados board in august 1988 
immediately after the sampl reported it was 200 million in the red 
and four months before the state of colorado took control of it 
he told the chronicle he resigned before his fathers acceptance 
of the republican presidential nomination to avoid any appearance 
of conflict of interest neither his father nor his fathers 
advisers pressured him to leave bush said 
regulators attributed silverados failure to substantial 
dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws rules and 
regulations the federal bailout of silverado may cost taxpayers 
1 billion or more 
the federal deposit insurance corp is examining the case to 
determine whether to sue silverados officers and directors 
many analysts including colorado sampl commissioner david paul 
attributed silverados collapse to a switch from traditional home 
mortgages in favor of riskier securities 
bush however disagreed my view is the institution had 
acquired a portfolio of assets that suffered from a terrible 
depressed economy not just in denver but throughout the 
southwest he said

children recruited into a war on pornography are 
turning in their barebottomed baby pictures a newspaper said 
wednesday 
primary school students confused by the campaigns slogan 
sweep the yellow also are coming to school prepared to sweep 
streets and turning in yellowcovered books from their parents 
bookcases the official china youth news said yellow ususally 
refers to pornographic material 
the yellow calamity has spread unchecked and has seriously 
harmed the spirit of our youth the newspaper said but this 
reporter feels that this campaign should not involve elementary 
school students 
the report said some young pupils told by teachers to turn in 
pornographic publications asked what pornography was and were told 
it was pictures of people not wearing clothes 
some obediently handed in their own baby pictures others 
brought in copies of baby pictorial a magazine for young people 
apparently because it had photos of naked infants 
the teacher did not know whether to laugh or cry the 
newspaper said 
it said even some teachers were not clear what qualified as 
pornographic literature and some students searched their homes for 
any books with a yellow cover 
other pupils told they were being organized into squads that 
would take to the streets sunday to sweep the yellow prepared 
themselves for a day of streetcleaning 
the official media carried similar reports this fall citing 
cases of parents going out and buying pornographic books so their 
children could meet school quotas one writer related that 
booksellers in his town were happy with their good sales of 
pornographic books and that children exchanged the books and read 
them with curiosity before handing them in 
other children reportedly were bringing in calendars with 
pictures of female movie stars or any magazine with a womans 
picture on the cover 
authorities have confiscated millions of books magazines and 
videos since the antipornography campaign began in august 
destroying some in public burnings 
the banned books include works by dissident fang lizhi and other 
critics of the government who have been blamed for the 
prodemocracy protests what the government calls the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion of this spring 
the drive recently has been expanded into a campaign against 
prostitution gambling drugs abduction and selling of women and 
children and profiteering from superstition

the united states will put up 200 million 
toward a 500 million temporary loan for poland as it awaits 
economic help from the international monetary fund the white house 
announced today 
other unspecified countries will contribute the remainder of 
the funds said deputy presidential press secretary stephen hart 
he said the us participation reflects support for polands 
economic reform program designed to restore sustained growth

from a 1 billion multination stabilization fund for poland 
the united states is contributing a 200 million grant to the 
stabilization fund intended to help put polands currency on a 
sound footing 
the loan expected to run no more than six months would be tied 
to polands acceptance of conditions set by the imf for a broader 
assistance program

imf program and anticipated loans from the world bank

petty officer kendall truitt said today his 
onetime friend and shipmate clayton hartwig did not cause the 
explosion aboard the uss iowa that killed 47 sailors 
testifying for the first time since the april 19 blast truitt 
told members of the house armed services subcommittee on 
investigations that the navys conclusion hartwig probably caused 
the explosion was ridiculous 
its a big coverup in my opinion truitt said 
hartwig did not know he was going to be the gunners mate the 
day of the explosion raising doubts about whether he could have 
planned the blast truitt said 
in addition the gunpowder had been stored in high heat and the 
cans were not airtight creating an explosion hazard truitt said 
clayton michael hartwig did not cause the explosion i do not 
think he committed suicide i believe the report is very 
misleading truitt said in his opening statement 
earlier in the hearing a naval investigative service official 
said he made a mistake in waiting several weeks before entering the 
inquiry into the iowa explosion 
it was my decision i made the wrong decision robert powers 
told the house armed services subcommittee on investigations as the 
panel held its second day of hearings on the battleship blast 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of the panel 
questioned why it took the nis until may 8 before it began its work 
on the april 19 explosion 
an awful lot of the evidence was thrown overboard by the time 
you fellows got there on may 8 mavroules said his voice rising 
in anger 
theres no question about that powers responded 
in his defense powers said the navy initially considered the 
explosion an accident not a criminal act and did not believe it 
was necessary to call in the nis although the agency did offer to 
help 
powers also said evidence was lost when sailors flooded gun 
turret no 2 where the explosion took place to put out the fire 
and later when the cleanup effort took place 
the crime scene was vastly contaminated no matter who was 
going to investigate powers said 
it would have been better if you had been there april 20 
mavroules said powers agreed 
the navy in its sept 7 report concluded that hartwig 
depicted in psychological profiles as a suicidal loner most 
likely caused the blast by inserting some type of detonator 
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch guns 
in testimony tuesday rear adm richard milligan who oversaw 
the navy inquiry said he was convinced that conclusion would 
stand up in a court of law 
but milligan added that he cannot blame the 24yearold gunners 
mate beyond a shadow of a doubt because hartwig and all the 
witnesses died in the explosion 
however dr richard c froede the armed forces medical 
examiner who performed the autopsies on the sailors told the house 
panel he has not changed his opinion that the deaths were 
accidental 
as of this day it has not changed froede said i only 
would make a change when i had more proof and all the 
investigations were over

federal immigration authorities today levied a 
record 580000 fine on a south carolina textile company accused of 
hiring scores of illegal aliens including a 12yearold boy 
the administrative fine on piedmont quilting corp of walhalla 
sc is the largest under the 1986 law that contains criminal and 
civil penalties for knowingly employing illegal aliens the 
immigration and naturalization service said 
one ins official said working conditions for three children 
almost bordered on bondage 
the agencys announcement came a day after the company and 11 
officers and managers were indicted in greenville sc on federal 
criminal charges related to the hiring of 117 illegal aliens from 
mexico and peru 
the administrative fine covers the employment of 85 illegal 
aliens including a 12yearold boy ins said the fine also covers 
the companys failure to comply with procedures to verify that more 
than 400 employees were not illegal aliens it said 
this is in defiance of the congressional mandate to prevent 
illegal aliens form obtaining employment in this country ins 
commissioner gene mcnary said in a statement 
mcnary said the agencys action should be a clear sign to 
those who have any doubts that the immigration and naturalization 
service is strongly committed to enforcing the employer sanctions 
in the 1986 law 
the criminal charges resulted from a sixmonth investigation of 
conditions at the company that included placement of an ins 
undercover agent as a plant employee said thomas p fischer 
director of the agencys district office in atlanta 
when ins agents raided the plant last july 17 they found three 
mexican boys two aged 15 and another 12 working on the plant 
fischer said in a telephone interview 
it almost bordered on bondage when you look at the age of 
these people he said they were being paid in cash there was 
no documentation 
the indictment filed tuesday charged that piedmont quilting 
knowingly hired and recruited illegal aliens for employment 
assistant us attorney david stephens said tuesday in greenville 
indicted on that charge were company owner alfred mizhir 55 
his wife gail mizhir 30 both of spring lake nj and nine 
other individuals including several hispanic legal employees of 
the plant 
piedmont quiltings attorney has said the illegal aliens 
presented the company with false documentation in order to get 
hired 
federal agents raided the company last july in what was called 
the biggest crackdown on the employment of illegal aliens outside 
south florida 
the indictment also includes 117 counts of harboring illegal 
aliens those charges are against the company its owners and the 
same individuals named in the first count 
two additional counts charge the company its owners and plant 
employees eugene scarpa of greenville and mary hill of seneca 
sc with making false statements on quarterly wage reports 
establishing a practice of hiring illegal aliens carries a 
maximum fine of 3000 per alien plus six months imprisonment 
stephens said 
the penalty for harboring illegal aliens and for making false 
statements on quarterly reports is up to five years imprisonment 
and 250000 in fines per count he said

a fire official testifying today at the 
trial of a man charged in a fiery bus crash that killed 27 people 
said today that polyurethane foam seat cushions like those on the 
vehicle are deadly when burned 
maj william h lilly of the lexington fire department took the 
stand for the defense at the murder trial of larry mahoney 36 of 
worthville ky who was driving a pickup that smashed headon with 
the church bus in may 1988 
mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder as well as drunken 
driving and other offenses his attorneys whose tactic has been to 
question the bus safety said mahoney may be called to tell his 
story 
today defense attorney william summers asked lilly if he was 
aware that the polyurethane foam seat cushions on the bus were 
hazardous when burned 
basically i know that polyurethane foam is dangerous and will 
kill you yes sir lilly replied 
under cross examination by assistant attorney general paul 
richwalsky jr lilly said the polyurethane cushions are commonly 
found in vehicles and hotel furniture richwalsky asked if the seat 
of fire trucks contain that material 
probably the same thing were talking about here lilly said 
in testimony tuesday eugene sober a nasa fire safety engineer 
said that many of the 24 youngsters and three adults killed in the 
fiery bus crash could have survived if the seats were fire 
resistant 
also on the witness stand tuesday the 13th day of testimony 
was former ford motor co vice president thomas feaheny who said 
existing technology could have prevented the fire 
judge charles satterwhite did not permit feaheny to provide 
details about technology he said might have prevented the fire 
but feaheny told reporters during a recess that a plastic gas 
tank on the radcliff first assembly of god church bus would have 
prevented the fire and saved the lives of many of those who died 
he handed out copies of reports he provided to the national 
transportation safety board during a 1988 hearing about the crash 
what you see in these reports is the technology has existed 
for over 10 years that could have prevented this tragedy even in an 
accident of this sort feaheny said and ford motor co has 
suppressed that technology and continues to do so to this date in a 
rather giant coverup 
ford rejected the claim and said feaheny fired by the company 
in 1983 and since involved in a failed lawsuit against ford 
executives had an ax to grind 
the suggestion that a plastic fuel tank would have prevented 
the carrollton tragedy is gross speculation at best said john 
jelinek a ford spokesman mr feahenys assertion that ford 
motor co has suppressed plastic fuel tank technology is obviously 
contrary to the facts 
in his crossexamination prosecutor paul richwalsky jr sought 
to show that feaheny lacked direct experience with ford buses 
feaheny insisted he was qualified to discuss the issue based on 30 
years in the automotive industry 
sober a fire safety expert testified that the seat cushions 
were made of flexible polyurethane foam and seat coverings of 
polychlorinated vinyl 
flexible polyurethane foam is the single largest class of 
fuels involved with fatal fires he said 
when burned the untreated foam emits hydrogen cyanide gas and 
the plastic emits hydrogen chloride gas he said both can be fatal 
after a typical bus seat burns for just a few minutes he said 
foam treated with fire retardant was readily available to 
the automotive industry when the school bus was manufactured in 
1977 he said and seats treated with fire retardant would have 
saved lives in the crash

oliver l north testified today i dont know 
for a fact that former national security adviser john m 
poindexter tore up a politically embarrassing policy statement that 
depicted the reagan administrations iran initiative as a straight 
armsforhostages deal 
north said his memory of the event was colored by the fact that 
poindexter acknowledged in congressional testimony in 1987 that he 
had destroyed the presidential document known as a finding on 
nov 20 1986 amid public scrutiny of the administrations arms 
sales to iran 
the former national security council aide testified at a 
pretrial hearing where poindexters lawyer richard beckler tried 
to demonstrate that north was tainted by poindexters immunized 
testimony to congress and therefore should not testify as a 
government witness 
under a 1972 supreme court ruling the government may make no 
use of a defendants testimony compelled under a limited grant of 
immunity that includes testimony given by other witnesses who may 
have been influenced by the immunized statements 
the presidential finding could have been any sheet of paper 
but for the fact that poindexter confirmed it in his 
immunized congressional testimony north told beckler 
i dont know for a fact that the document destroyed that 
morning was the finding north said later when questioned by 
irancontra prosecutor michael bromwich 
north testified at his own trial last april that he watched 
poindexter rip up the document as thenattorney general edwin meese 
iii began focusing on a november 1985 ciaassisted shipment of hawk 
antiaircraft missiles to iran 
today however north said that he hadnt actually read the 
document at the time poindexter destroyed it 
the destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal 
charges against poindexter who is accused of falsely telling 
congress that he didnt learn of the missile shipment to iran until 
january 1986 
the finding signed by president reagan in december 1985 was 
drafted because of the ciaassisted shipment the previous month 
poindexter is scheduled to go on trial jan 22 on charges of 
conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of 
making false statements in the irancontra scandal 
on tuesday north said he was unable to remember details of 
meetings with his exboss even though the nowconvicted reagan 
aide testified about those meetings at his own trial 
its difficult to get answers out of this witness declared 
us district court judge harold greene who said he would give 
prosecutors the widest latitude in interrogating north 
questioned for five hours tuesday by irancontra prosecutor dan 
webb north repeatedly was shown transcripts of the testimony he 
gave last april in which he referred to contacts with poindexter 
north refused to say that poindexter had directed him to give 
false statements when north denied to house intelligence committee 
members that he had been assisting the contras 
john poindexter felt as i did that he hoped the right 
questions wouldnt come up so that false answers wouldnt 
have to be given north said in connection with the aug 6 1986 
meeting in the white house situation room 
north testified at his own trial that he felt like a pawn in 
a chess game played by giants when after a discussion with 
poindexter he made the statements to the house committee 
but north testified tuesday that no one told me to make the 
false statements 
webb suggested that the giants north referred to were 
president reagan former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
and poindexter 
that is not what i said retorted north in general terms 
i would say it was the executive and legislative branches of 
government and included secretary of state george shultz defense 
secretary caspar weinberger and cia director william casey

more than 6000 vietnamese held in detention 
centers wednesday carried banners and chanted slogans denouncing 
the involuntary return of 51 other boat people to vietnam a 
government spokesman said 
some shouted they would rather die than return to vietnam local 
radio and television stations reported 
about 3000 vietnamese marched around the camp at the outlying 
hei ling chau island a former leper colony and another 3000 
demonstrated at whitehead camp in the new territories about 300 
staged a protest at the chi ma wan center on the offshore lantau 
island 
the demonstrations were peaceful and none lasted more than two 
hours government spokesman lionel rodrigues said 
hong kongs chief secretary sir david ford defended the 
involuntary repatriation of vietnamese saying the program will 
continue despite international criticism 
it is our intention to put into place a continuing program to 
return to vietnam all those who are judged not to be refugees 
chief secretary sir david ford told the legislative council his 
speech did not include a timetable for further repatriation 
in london foreign office minister francis maude said it could 
take as long as two years to return all the vietnamese classified 
as illegal immigrants he said britain could not delay just because 
it makes other countries uncomfortable 
its all very well for others to say to us cant you delay a 
little bit longer but that plea has been made to us before 
maude told a parliamentary committee 
vietnam in a commentary monitored in bangkok partly blamed 
economic embargos imposed by noncommunist nations for causing its 
citizens to flee 
the policy of hostility and economic sanctions by some 
countries against vietnam over the past 10 years are one of the 
reasons causing economic difficulties in vietnam it said this 
led to the fact that some people fled the country 
about 44000 vietnamese who have sailed into hong kong since 
june 1988 are considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove 
they fled their communist homeland out of fear of persecution 
nearly 6800 have been denied refugee status after being 
screened by immigration officials compared with slightly more than 
700 who qualified 
the first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked 
screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police 
before dawn tuesday and put on a plane to hanoi vietnam has 
promised the returnees will be treated humanely and not punished 
the hong kong government says 
it argues that returning the vietnamese home is more humane than 
keeping them indefinitely in the camps which are overcrowded and 
rife with violence and malnutrition 
but human rights organizations british opposition politicians 
and the us government have criticized the program the us state 
department expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said 
british authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those 
persons from vietnam who seek it 
ford responded that those who have been loudest in their 
condemnation have been slowest in bringing forward practical 
alternatives we have returned no one who in the eyes of the 
international community is a bona fide refugee 
he added we do not look for the worlds applause but we are 
entitled i feel to the worlds understanding 
about 56000 vietnamese are housed in squalid camps those who 
arrived before june 1988 automatically were granted refugee status 
and are eligible for resettlement 
china which will assume control of the british colony in 1997 
has said it would like hong kong to resolve the vietnamese refugee 
issue before then

loomed largest for americans a poll shows 
nearly threequarters of people surveyed said they followed 
closely the stories about the san francisco tremor according to

state officials touring a site under 
consideration for a radioactive waste dump had to be escorted two 
miles on foot today after demonstrators formed a human chain to pen 
them in their cars a protest leader said 
members of citizens against radioactive dumping also rushed 
cars trucks and tractors to block roads leading to the site after 
field teams from the lowlevel radioactive waste siting commission 
and several sheriffs deputies arrived said taffy rook a 
spokeswoman for the protest group 
sheriff lee price called off the tour and preliminary testing 
about 11 am because of the demonstrations said jeff gebhardt 
cochairman of the protest group 
about 150 antidump protesters clustered around the commissions 
two cars preventing them from leaving the site gebhardt said 
after 30 minutes one group of state workers abandoned their car 
and were escorted off the site by deputies who said they would come 
back for the others he said 
the wooded area is in a dairy region about 50 miles south of 
syracuse 
protesters also had staked out a second site under consideration 
near taylor in case teams went there 
a dispatcher for the sheriffs department said no one was 
available to comment because most personnel were at the site 
protesters had also camped out overnight at three potential dump 
sites in allegany county preparing to block state officials from 
beginning inspections and tests on land there authorities said 
state officials were not in the county this morning 
i hope that people dont go outside the law commission 
spokeswoman susan baranski said tuesday the courts have made it 
clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do 
this 
antidump groups in allegany and cortland counties have vowed to 
prevent the testing at the proposed dump sites saying their 
protests would be nonviolent but that they expected arrests 
there will be civil disobedience said sally campbell of the 
allegany county nonviolent action group whatever they try to do 
were going to be out there to stop them from doing it 
the five sites were chosen by the commission in september under 
federal law states must have a place to store lowlevel 
radioactive waste by 1993 
the commission plans to complete soil testing and other 
evaluations by spring it will then narrow down the number of sites 
to two or three for more comprehensive tests

people with aids can use their computer 
terminals to learn about the latest treatments for their illness or 
chat with others who have the disease under a federally funded 
program developed here 
patients also can ask nurses about condoms and other health 
topics anonymously and use a computer databank to help them make 
decisions on insurance housing transportation and other matters 
the programs developer said tuesday 
patricia brennan an associate professor of nursing and systems 
engineering at case western reserve university said she knew of no 
other project of its type in the country the program is funded by 
a 600000 threeyear grant from the national institute of health 
its not so much how to take care of their illness as how to 
deal with daytoday living how to get a bus schedule how to 
prepare snacks it also guides someone through decisionmaking 
such as where to live or whether to take a new drug ms brennan 
said 
the experimental system is linked to a databank and transmission 
system called cleveland freenet a free communityaccess network 
more specialized information on acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome is on an electronic bulletin board of aids data and 
informationsharing accessible only to the aids patients ms 
brennan said users may remain anonymous she said 
twenty aids patients selected under the project have used the 
service in the past year ms brennan said 
the program is entering its second phase which will involve 50 
aids patients and compare the effectiveness of the computer system 
with the more conventional use of the telephone ms brennan said 
the aids computer system is not commercially available but ms 
brennan said she hopes it will be a springboard 
the decisionmaking aspect is one of the systems unique 
features ms brennan said it lists a series of questions and 
considerations to help a person decide how to travel whether to 
buy a car or where to live 
ms brennan said she is especially interested in patients use 
of the system to talk to one another via computer 
one of the biggest problems is fatigue even with people who 
arent physically very ill she said we have people who may 
have enough energy to get to work but theyre exhausted the rest of 
the evening so the network allows them to make social contacts at 
their own pace 
aids is a disease that attacks the human immune systems leaving 
victims vulnerable to a variety of diseases and tumors it is 
spread chiefly through sexual contact and sharing hypodermic 
needles for drug use 
ms brennan said there were about 1600 aids cases in ohio as of 
dec 4 with 409 cases in cuyahoga county which includes cleveland

a paramedic says he was fired for 
arranging to give away teddy bears to children being taken to the 
hospital but an ambulance service spokesman said today the firing 
was related to job performance not stuffed animals 
paramedic chuck brady jr was dismissed nov 28 and two other 
paramedics were suspended by kevin raun ambulance service director 
for apple valley lakeville and farmington 
the three said they were told by raun that they had circumvented 
his authority when money was solicited for the teddy bears without 
his knowledge beecham and adams supported the idea but did not 
actually solicit money the st paul pioneer press dispatch 
reported today 
an american legion post donated 1000 to the paramedics union 
after an appeal from brady the st paul newspaper reported 
raun declined to comment on the matter but bill holton 
chairman of the ambulance service board that upheld bradys firing 
said the dismissal had nothing to do with the teddy bears 
the dismissal had to do with job performance he said 
holton would not give specifics of bradys job performance 
holton said the ambulance company has in the past given away 
stuffed animals to children being taken to hospitals so the 
program by itself is a very good program and one we had intended to 
do again this year he said 
brady said that on his most recent job evaluation he received 
satisfactory or aboveaverage ratings and no negative remarks

a prosecutor says a twoyear prison sentence 
was appropriate for a man who slapped his 4yearold son for 
sniffing gasoline to get high 
richard lewis vardaman 42 of georgetown pleaded guilty to 
battery and was sentenceed last week by judge cecil tedder 
it was a serious case of child abuse prosecutor chris raff 
said monday it was not normal discipline i think the proof 
justified the sentence the message is clear child abuse would 
not be tolerated 
defense attorney bill mills said the sentence was too harsh but 
that his client probably wont appeal it 
vardaman caught his son and another boy sniffing gas from a can 
near their home in may and paddled both boys mills said but twice 
the next day vardaman found his son sniffing gas the defense 
attorney said 
he slapped him once on each side of the face that time 
mills said 
vardaman and his wife took the child to a hospital because the 
boy was acting drunk mills said the boy seemed normal by the 
time they reached the hospital but the emergency room nurse and a 
doctor noticed the bruises on his face and contacted police 
photos of the boy taken at the hospital were shown to the judge 
they looked pretty bad mills said the child has a ruddy 
complexion and his face was puffy in the picture 
mills said a representative from the state human services 
department testified that it was an isolated case of abuse

the crew of the nuclear submarine 
tennessee successfully launched a trident 2 missile wednesday after 
the navy warned greenpeace antinuclear protesters to stay out of 
the safety zone the navy said 
the launch was the second straight successful undersea 
testfiring of the navys newest and deadliest nuclear weapon 
keeping it on track for operational deployment next march two of 
the first three submarine tests failed explosively 
the tennessee was cruising submerged in the atlantic about 50 
miles offshore when the 44foot 265 million missile burst out of 
a launch tube broke the surface ignited and hurled a dummy 
warhead package to an undisclosed ocean target several thousand 
miles away 
the navy reported several minutes after the 915 am launch 
that the test was successful 
another great day for the navy said vice admiral roger f 
bacon commander of the atlantic submarine fleet 
a 60foot greenpeace ketch the mondeivitano briefly penetrated 
the launch safety zone but withdrew after a navy ship warned it to 
move away as a precaution six coast guard cutters patroled the 
perimeter of the 5000yard safety area around the submarine 
they observed the range safety warning said lt cmdr bill 
sonntag a navy spokesman 
we made our point that we have a right to protest in 
international waters said greenpeace spokeswoman shannon fagan 
we will now take our fight to congress in an effort to have this 
missile system canceled the world can no longer afford the waste 
of precious resources on weapons of mass destruction like the 
trident 2 
greenpeace protesters tried to halt a trident 2 launch dec 4 by 
sending the 190foot vessel mv greenpeace with 25 aboard into the 
tennessees safety zone 
a navy ship intercepted the intruding vessel and damaged it by 
repeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the 
smokestacks stopping the engines navy sailors in swift boats 
corraled two greenpeace highspeed rafts that tried to approach the 
tennessee cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safety 
zone 
greenpeace had halted a trident 2 test with the same tactics in 
july 
a motor nozzle system blamed for the two failures of the 
trident 2 has been redesigned and the navy is accelerating the 
test schedule aiming to have the trident ready for patrols by 
march 
the tennessee will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea each 
with 24 of the weapons the trident 2 is capable of hurling as many 
as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4600 miles 
away

six people were recovering today from 
transplant surgery after doctors gave them seven organs from the 
same donor 
this is the first weve ever done with the two lungs heart 
liver kidneys and pancreas said susan kuslis clinical director 
of the california transplant donor network which coordinates organ 
recovery for five northern california transplant centers 
the donors identity and cause of death were not released to 
protect the grieving family storms of publicity surrounding 
successful transplants tend to discourage family members from 
authorizing organ donations kuslis said 
the extraordinary donation was possible in part because the 
donor was in good health she said 
four of the recipients were listed in serious but stable 
condition at pacific presbyterian medical center the two others 
were reported in critical but stable condition at stanford 
university medical center 
although donations of three and even four organs are not 
unusual fewer than 1 percent of organ donations nationwide have 
involved seven organs given to different people said wanda bond a 
spokeswoman for the united network for organ sharing which 
administers organ procurement nationally record keeping began oct 
1 1987 she said 
for all the organs to be viable and that every one had a 
match thats terrific said bond 
factors that determine matches include blood and tissue types 
organ size distances between donor and possible recipient and the 
medical conditions of patients bond said 
hearts and lungs must be recovered and transplanted within about 
four hours experts said kidneys can last up to 72 hours and must 
be offered nationally in an effort to find the best genetic match 
but recipients were also found locally 
at stanford one of the donors lungs helped a woman who had 
been awaiting a transplant for a year the other lung went to a 
woman who had spent five years with a lethal lung disease 
the donors heart went to a 60yearold san francisco man 
suffering from terminal cardiac disease and one of his kidneys 
aided a 35yearold man with endstage renal disease pacific 
presbyterian spokeswoman julie murray said 
his other kidney and his pancreas went to a 34yearold berkeley 
woman with diabetes and renal failure murray said the liver went 
to a 38yearold woman from tacoma wash whose own liver had 
failed she said

a top drug enforcement administration official 
says the strain between us drug agents and mexican officials 
stemming from the 1985 killing of dea agent enrique camarena has 
been eased by mexicos prosecution of those involved 
i think weve seen very positive signs from the new 
administration in mexico since last december particularly the 
president acting deputy dea administrator terrence burke said in 
an interview 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari who took office a 
year ago has made vigorous efforts to change his countrys image 
as a haven for drug dealers and corruption by jailing traffickers 
arresting corrupt officials and seizing tons of drugs 
the successful prosecution and sentencing in mexico of rafael 
caro quintero 37 ernesto rafael fonseca carrillo 56 and 10 
other men involved in the killings of camarena and mexican pilot 
alfredo zavala avelar has boosted dea confidence that those charged 
in mexico will be brought to justice burke said 
i think this is an extremely positive sign burke said after 
caro quintero fonseca and the others were sentenced tuesday to 40 
years for their roles in the killings prison time for related 
convictions brought caro quinteros total sentence to 116 years and 
fonsecas to 144 
fernando arias a spokesman for mexican attorney general enrique 
alvarez del castillo said caro quintero and fonseca would have to 
serve 74 and 53 years respectively because of time remaining from 
previous sentences 
state department spokesman richard boucher said wednesday that 
the united states is pleased that those responsible for these 
brutal murders have been brought to justice 
these convictions further demonstrate the resolve of the 
salinas administration in its fight against drug trafficking 
boucher said we look forward to continued cooperation of the 
mexican government in the battle against this common threat to the 
national security and wellbeing of both our countries 
the us support of mexican actions follows years of tension 
illustrated by us contentions that mexican authorities had 
allowed caro quintero to escape to costa rica where he was 
captured in an effort to pressure the mexican government for 
action the us customs service virtually blocked the border by 
conducting full searches of all mexicans trying to enter the united 
states 
it was revealed in july that caro quintero and fonseca had 
bribed mexico city prison officials to let them live in luxury 
accommodations they had built inside the prison the two were then 
transferred to maximumsecurity facilities 
camarena 37 was kidnapped feb 7 1985 in guadalajara zavala 
avelar was kidnapped a few days later their bulletriddled bodies 
showing signs of torture were found march 5 1985 wrapped in 
plastic bags and buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles 
southeast of guadalajara 
the camarena killing was from the beginning and has continued 
to remain a highly emotional issue for dea agents said burke 
the dea never pulled back in mexico even immediately after the 
camarena killing he said 
we did just the opposite he said we sent additional 
agents in and our signal at that time was you kill a dea agent 
and well hound you to the grave 
were just continuing to move ahead in our investigation until 
were satisfied that every single person who was responsible for 
his death is brought to justice either in the united states or in 
mexico burke said 
another person charged in connection with the camarena case 
ruben zuno arce 59 the brotherinlaw of former mexican president 
luis echeverria was arrested saturday by dea agents at los angeles 
international airport as he got off a plane arriving from mexico 
zuno arce pleaded absolutely innocent monday to charges that 
he plotted to torture and kill camarena codefendant juan jose 
bernabe ramirez is charged with the felony murder of a federal 
agent among other things three other people were convicted in 
1988 in los angeles on charges connected to the camarena killing

police and soldiers battled 
wednesday with more than 8000 blacks protesting the prosecution of 
neighbors for not paying electric bills police said about 400 
people were arrested and 12 injured including six officers 
the clash one of the largest in south africa this year 
occurred when blacks began a march toward the courthouse in ermelo 
120 miles east of johannesburg despite having been denied 
permission for the protest 
police headquarters said marchers began throwing stones after 
officers tried to disperse them with tear gas and stun grenades 
officers then fired birdshot injuring at least six people 
including a child police said 
the five wounded adults were held in custody to face charges of 
public violence while 397 people arrested at the courthouse were 
released with a warning police said 
while the clash was in progress government offices in ermelos 
black township were firebombed police said 
the marchers were protesting the start of court proceedings 
against 88 residents of the township for not paying electric bills 
earlier wednesday police reported three more deaths in 
factional fighting between rival black groups near durban bringing 
the death toll around the port city this month to 71 law and order 
minister adriaan vlok said 380 police reinforcements were bening 
sent into the areas embattled shantytowns 
several dozen other blacks have been killed elsewhere in natal 
province this month in an escalation of a political power struggle 
that has claimed about 2500 lives in three years 
police also reported more violence related to a sixweek strike 
by more than 20000 black employees of the state transport company 
which runs rail and harbor operations nationwide five coaches were 
set afire and a constable was thrown to his death from a moving 
train near kathlehong east of johannesburg 
south african transport services said it fired 2477 more 
strikers raising to 15094 the number dismissed during the strike 
the strikers are demanding an increase of their minimum monthly 
wage from 225 to 560 
the main combatants in the natal violence are the united 
democratic front a nationwide antiapartheid coalition and 
inkatha 15 millionmember political group headed by zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi 
both groups oppose apartheid but they have been battling each 
other for supremacy in natal since late 1986 
the united democratic front which is aligned with the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement favors protests 
strikes and sanctions to pressure the whiterun government 
the relatively conservative buthelezi does not support such 
measures and has been criticized by the front for participating in 
the black homeland system both groups concede they do not have 
full control of all their supporters 
hundreds of residents in the townships have fled their homes 
and some are living with white friends or employers in durban

a 14yearold boy has received a life 
term without parole for twice raping an elderly woman when he was 
13 
joe harris sullivan who was sentenced tuesday would have been 
eligible for parole after 25 years if he had killed his victim and 
received life for firstdegree murder assistant state attorney 
larry kaden said wednesday 
florida law doesnt provide for paroling criminals given life 
terms in certain noncapital cases kaden said sullivans past 
criminal record and other crimes committed in connection with the 
rapes gave him a sentencing guideline score that called for life 
kaden said 
im going to try to send him away for as long as i can 
circuit judge nicholas geeker said before imposing two concurrent 
life sentences on the pensacola youngster 
regardless of the boys age he deserved the maximum sentence 
because of his long criminal history including an assault on a 
mental health clinic counselor and a burglary during which he 
killed a dog kaden told the judge geeker agreed 
he is beyond help the judge said the juvenile system has 
been utterly incapable of doing anything with mr sullivan 
kaden said he expected the case to be appealed sullivans 
attorney mack plant said wednesday that he doesnt handle 
appellate work but that the court would appoint an attorney for the 
youth if he wanted to appeal 
a jury convicted sullivan as an adult of burglary theft and 
sexual battery after about 30 minutes of deliberation nov 30 
he was accused of breaking into the 74yearold womans home 
while she was away may 4 and stealing jewelry and cash and then 
returning the same day to rape her twice at knifepoint 
i have fears i have nightmares the woman told geeker 
before he sentenced sullivan it has had a bad psychological 
effect on me 
she said he probably would have killed her if neighbors had not 
called for help 
sullivan said nothing at the hearing and showed no emotion as 
the sentence was pronounced 
he didnt have any reaction at all plant said in a 
telephone interview he was just kind of emotionless 
plant said the youth had insisted all along he was innocent 
thats quite a sentence plant said he had quite a 
criminal history but i think he would be a candidate for 
rehabilitation 
plant agreed that the boys sentence was tougher than what he 
probably would have received for a murder conviction 
a firstdegree murder conviction can be punished by death and 
the us supreme court has upheld such sentences for murderers as 
young as 16 but has not ruled on cases involving younger children

a cabinet minister wednesday after the government released five of 
their jailed comrades officials said 
rubaiya sayeed daughter of home minister mufti mohammad sayeed 
was taken to a friends home in this northern city two hours after 
the militants were freed downtown police said 
ms sayeed 22 was flown to new delhi later and met at the 
airport by her father mother brother and sister she hugged her 
father then buried her face on his shoulder and cried 
young moslem men celebrated the militants release by shooting 
off firecrackers in srinagar summer capital of indias 
northernmost state of jammukashmir which borders pakistan 
about 3000 people shouted antiindia slogans and waved the 
national flag of pakistan which has fought three wars with india 
over kashmir since both nations gained independence from britain in 
1947 
ms sayeed was abducted at gunpoint dec 8 as she was going home 
from her job at a srinagar hospital 
the kashmir liberation front which demands secession from india 
of the mainly moslem state from india claimed responsibility for 
the abduction its chairman said the group might try other 
kidnappings in its campaign against the hindudominated government 
the kidnappers had threatened to kill ms sayeed if their 
colleagues were not freed 
sayeed is the first moslem to head the home ministry which is 
in charge of internal security the appointment was seen as part of 
prime minister vp singhs efforts to appease moslems who bore 
the brunt of hindumoslem riots that claimed more than 300 lives 
this fall 
the kidnapping was the first crisis for singh a hindu who took 
office dec 2 
earlier wednesday sayeed unshaven and wrapped in a brown 
shawl said solving the militant campaign in jammukashmir was the 
governments no 1 priority program 
there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state 
he said 
the freed militants include abdul hamid sheikh a top leader of 
the kashmir liberation front sheikh who was wounded in a clash 
with police last month and arrested was taken by ambulance from a 
srinagar hospital and handed over to his organization the

jammukashmir indias only moslemmajority state to become 
independent or part of predominantly moslem pakistan 
the chairman of the group amanullah khan said in pakistan that 
he hoped the indian government would adopt a similar wise 
attitude toward the future of kashmir instead of waiting until 
it is shunted out and humiliated by kashmiri freedom fighters 
pakistan had denounced the kidnapping as contrary to islamic 
precepts presumably referring to islamic tradition which imposes 
rigid guidelines on the treatment of women 
khan dismissed the criticism saying indian paramilitary troops 
have killed 300 of our people in the last one and a half years 
including women 
asked if his militant organization would try other kidnappings 
as part of its secession campaign khan replied it depends on 
how the indian government behaves 
moslems make up 64 percent of the states 5 million peoeple but 
only about 12 percent of the countrys 880 million people hindus 
account for about 80 percent 
kashmir is claimed by both india and pakistan and the two 
countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining 
independence from britain in 1947 a ceasefire line monitored by 
the united nations separates the state into indian and pakistani

a texas appeals court today overturned the 
murder conviction of a black high school janitor who contended his 
prosecution in the 1980 rape and slaying of a white teenager was 
racially motivated 
the prosecution of 38yearold clarence brandley was marked by 
blatant unfairness the court said in granting the nineyear 
death row inmate a new trial but the court did not directly 
address the question of racism 
brandley was convicted of murdering 16yearold cheryl fergeson 
at a high school his first trial ended with a hung jury an 
allwhite jury found him guilty in a second trial 
im trying to hold back the tears brandley a former high 
school janitor said from prison in huntsville today its made 
my christmas its been a long time its something i didnt think 
was coming 
defense attorney mike degeurin said he would ask for brandleys 
release on bail while prosecutors decide whether to seek a new 
trial if the court agrees and brandley makes bail hell be out 
before christmas degeurin said 
montgomery county district peter speers did not immediately 
return calls for comment on the ruling and on whether he would 
pursue a third trial 
the appeals court in a 63 opinion said the states 
investigative procedures lacked the rudiments of fairness 
among examples cited by the court were that another janitor who 
testified for the state allegedly was threatened by a texas ranger 
and that the state suppressed information that could have 
implicated someone else 
the principles of due process embodied within the united 
states constitution must not indeed cannot countenance such 
blatant unfairness wrote judge david a berchelmann jr 
in 1987 after a 10day hearing retired district judge perry 
pickett recommended that brandley get a new trial ruling that the 
previous two had been tainted with racism 
brandleys attorneys have offered evidence that police and 
prosecutors had set out to prove that brandley the only black 
janitor at the school was guilty rather than seeking the real 
killer 
during the 1987 hearing pickett was told that the district 
attorney and trial judge met secretly on strategy against brandley 
prosecutors have denied brandley was the subject of racial 
discrimination 
thank you jesus brandleys mother minnie ola brandley 
said when she heard the courts decision mrs brandley who lives 
in conroe said she is confident a new trial will prove her sons 
innocence 
i think they have evidence to turn him lose she said my 
child didnt do that were hoping and all we do can is pray

astronomers have spotted the most distant known 
star in the milky way and say the accidental discovery could help 
determine the total mass of the galaxy 
that includes mysterious invisible matter that astronomers know 
exists but are unable to identify an astronomer with the space 
telescope science institute said tuesday 
astronomers suspect that there is a lot of additional material 
surrounding our galaxy that doesnt give off light said howard 
bond who along with two others discovered the distant star last 
spring 
we dont know the mass of the milky way but if we can find 
objects that are far out and measure their speed it will help us 
determine the galaxys total mass the visible areas and the dark 
areas 
astronomers use the speed of stars to determine gravitational 
pull upon them and from its gravity the mass of the galaxy 
astronomers theorize the galaxys dark matter could be dim stars 
that are too faint to be seen black hole remnants of massive stars 
that exploded early in the galaxys history or some unknown type of 
subatomic particle bond said 
we used to think that the majority of the mass of the milky 
way was stars but now we suspect stars may only be 10 percent of 
all the mass he said once the mystery of the dark matter is 
solved he said we may find something completely unexpected that 
could revolutionize our thinking about physics 
andrew fraknoi executive director of the astronomical society 
of the pacific in san francisco said the discovery is important 
because it is another confirmation that the milky way is much 
larger than once thought 
when you look at in a larger context thats what makes this so 
exciting if theyve really found something so distant that it is 
way beyond where we thought the borders of the galaxy lay he 
said 
the scientists stumbled upon the star while studying a distant 
galaxy the star is located 160000 light years from earth in the 
direction of the constellation virgo 
the milky way was once thought to be only about 100000 lights 
year across since the earth is about 30000 light years from the 
center of the milky way the discovery means the galaxy is larger 
than even more recent estimates indicated 
it was just dumb luck that this star was in the way of what 
they were looking at it was totally serendipitous said ray 
villard a spokesman for the institute it just shows that there 
are a lot of wonderful surprises out there that we may stumble upon 
when were looking for something else 
the star is an isolated member of an immense but thinly 
populated halo of old faint stars surrounding the milky way it 
was spotted while astronomers robin ciardullo and george jacoby of 
the national optical astronomy observatories in tucson ariz were 
surveying the giant elliptical galaxy m49 which is 50 million 
lightyears from earth 
ciardullo jacoby and bond have observed the star using 
telescopes in hawaii and arizona and measurements of its 
brightness have been made at the cerro tololo interamerican 
observatory in chile 
the star is a member of a wellknown class of stars called the 
rr lyrae variables bond said because the brightness of those 
stars already has been documented astronomers can use the 
brightness of the new star known only as the virgo variable 
to measure its distance he said

black leader nelson mandela 
expected to be released within weeks after 27 years in jail 
visited president fw de klerk on wednesday to discuss prospects 
for negotiating an end to south africas racial conflict 
the main farright party denounced the meeting the first 
between mandela and de klerk as a step toward white capitulation 
liberal leaders however hailed the event as evidence the 
government accepts the central role of mandelas outlawed guerrilla 
movement the african national congress in any political 
settlement 
the meeting took place against the backdrop of one of the worst 
clashes in south africa this year as police and soldiers battled 
with more than 8000 blacks protesting the prosecution of neighbors 
for not paying electric bills police said about 400 people were 
arrested and 12 injured including six officers in the incident 
near ermelo 120 miles east of johannesburg 
the justice ministry said mandela requested the meeting at 
tuynhuis the presidential office in cape town and that de klerk 
welcomed the opportunity 
mandela the countrys bestknown black leader has been 
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plotting 
an antigovernment sabotage campaign 
the meeting was mandelas second with a south african president 
this year he met with pw botha on july 5 also at tuynhuis 
since replacing botha on aug 15 de klerk has made several 
conciliatory moves toward the black majority in an effort to ease 
racial tensions 
he has loosened restrictions on antigovernment protests met 
with prominent opposition leaders ordered desgregation of 
whitesonly beaches traveled to several blackruled african 
states and proposed the repeal of the separate amenities act 
which permits the segregation of many public facilities 
on oct 15 de klerk ordered the unconditional release of seven 
of mandelas anc colleagues the lack of violence related to their 
release is seen as a factor that makes mandelas freedom likely 
the two discussed ways and means to address current obstacles 
in the way of meaningful dialogue the ministry said followup 
talks in the new year are envisaged 
the talks fitted in with mr de klerks program to consult 
with the full spectrum of political opinion concerning the mutual 
future of all south africans the statement said 
the farright conservative party which won 31 percent of the 
white vote in septembers parliamentary elections said the meeting 
represented a de facto legalization of the anc 
the conservative leader andries treurnicht condemned de klerk 
for meeting the leader of a banned terrorist organization and 
said the president underestimated whites desire to retain full 
political sovereignty 
the antiapartheid democratic party welcomed the meeting and 
said de klerk should take the further step of agreeing to talks 
with the ancs exiled leadership 
there was no immediate reaction from the anc to wednesdays 
meeting tom sebina a spokesman at headquarters in lusaka zambia 
said he might have a statement thursday after consulting with his 
superiors 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
we applaud the meeting between mandela and de klerk 
we view the commencement of a dialogue between the government 
and credible representatives of the black majority as the most 
important first step in the process of change he said 
david walsh a political scientist at the university of cape 
town said the meeting was symbolic of the very important change 
thats taken place in government thinking 
there is now a recognition by the government of mr mandelas 
importance and the importance of the anc walsh said 
slowly but surely a climate is being built up where there can be 
formal negotiations about a new constitutional order 
de klerk says he wants to end racial discrimination and extend 
political rights to south africas 28 million blacks within five 
years 
however he opposes black majority rule and a oneperson 
onevote system he envisions some mechanism that will give whites 
veto power on major policy decisions 
mandela 71 is not likely to be released this year but 
government sources have said he probably will be freed before 
parliament convenes in early february 
all prominent black leaders even conservative ones say 
mandelas release is a precondition for negotiations with the 
government 
the anc headquartered in zambia says it will not enter talks 
until the 3yearold state of emergency is lifted all political 
prisoners are freed and remaining segregation laws repealed 
although its bombing and sabotage campaign has been virtually 
dormant in recent months the movement has refused to repudiate 
violence 
de klerk says he is ready to talk without preconditions to any 
political leaders and groups committed to peaceful solutions but 
he has rejected the ancs demand that nonracial elections be held 
for an assembly to draft a postapartheid constitution he insists 
the anc is only one of several black political groups that should 
participate in negotiations 
mandela is held in a suburbanstyle staff residence at victor 
verster prison farm near cape town and has met regularly with 
antiapartheid leaders and with cabinet ministers

sixty percent of american workers favor 
onthejob drug testing according to a gallup poll released 
wednesday by a corporate group that said the results give a green 
light to increased employer testing 
the survey done for a newly formed organization of 14 large 
corporations concerned about employers rights said workers tended 
to support some programs over others 
for example 51 percent of the 1007 employees polled indicated 
that companies should have the right to randomly test any employee 
for drug use support rose to 70 percent for testing employees 
suspected of drug usage 
twentyfour percent of the workers said they had seen or heard 
of drug use by coworkers on the job 
on the broadest question 60 percent of the sample said they 
favored their company adopting some sort of drugtesting policy 
not counted were 9 percent whose employers already have such a 
program support for testing was strongest from workers in rural 
areas those 55 and older and those with an education of high 
school or less 
fourteen percent of those who did not attend college opposed 
drug testing at their company compared to 28 percent for those 
with a college degree and 48 percent for those who had done 
postgraduate work 
workers attitudes are far more conservative than we had 
anticipated mark a de bernardo executive director of the new 
institute for a drugfree workplace said in a statement 
employees simply do not want to tolerate working with drug 
abusers on the job de bernardo said more significantly the 
survey reaffirms the policy of increasing numbers of employers who 
are drug testing and gives a clear and unmistakable green light to 
further testing of employees and job applicants 
the national labor relations board said in june that employers 
cannot unilaterally begin testing unionized workers for drug use 
but can test job applicants regardless of whether unions object 
the board said employee testing falls under collective bargaining 
and therefore must be the subject of unionmanagement negotiations 
there was no immediate comment from the aflcio to the survey 
which did show employee reservations about drug testing 
in one question only 26 percent of respondents agreed that 
testing was a necessity fortytwo percent said it should be 
done despite reservations while 29 percent said it invaded privacy 
and should be done only under limited circumstances 
the workers gave their highest support for drug testing of 
workers in safetysensitive jobs 
the 14 corporatons in the institute each have some sort of 
drugtesting program de bernardo said 
they are bellsouth corp of atlanta capital citiesabc inc 
philadelphia dow chemical usa midland mich georgiapacific 
corp atlanta goodyear tire amp rubber co akron ohio hoffmanla 
roche inc nutley nj ibm corp white plains ny johnson amp 
johnson new brunswick nj mobil oil new york motorola inc 
schaumberg ill pfizer inc new york texaco inc white plains 
ny texas instruments dallas and 3m co st paul minn 
the institute hired the gallup organization which interviewed a 
random sample of 1007 fulltime workers around the nation last 
month fortytwo percent of those surveyed described their 
occupation as professional 25 percent as blue collar 20 percent 
as managerial and 10 percent as secretarial or clerical the rest 
were other or refused to answer the question 
the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 31 percent

president bush signed legislation today 
clearing the way to expand everglades national park and ordering 
the army corps of engineers to restore the natural flow of water to 
the florida river of grass 
he also signed a measure providing federal matching funds to 
help preserve critical wetlands in the united states canada and 
mexico he said the bills will help achieve his campaign goal of 
no net loss of wetlands 
bush signed the north american wetlands conservation act in a 
ceremony in the roosevelt room after signing the everglades measure 
the wetlands act will provide more than 70 million over four 
years to help purchase and preserve wetlands which serve as vital 
feeding areas for ducks and other migratory fowl 
bush said the dwindling population of ducks is largely 
attributable to the steady loss of wetland areas that weve 
experienced the united states has been losing wetlands at the 
rate of nearly 400000 acres a year 
bush does not favor a ban on development projects that destroy 
wetlands but wants any development offset with an equal amount of 
acreage restored as wetlands 
even in times of serious fiscal constraints we can still meet 
our highest environmental priorities and this is one of mine 
bush said in signing the everglades legislation 
the 107600acre expansion will be undertaken in cooperation 
with the state of florida which will donate 35000 new acres to 
the federal park the government estimates it will cost 40 million 
to acquire the rest of the new acreage with florida havin agreed 
to pay 20 percent of the costs 
the everglades the second largest national park in the 48 
contiguous states are home to 13 endangered species but problems 
with the flow of waters have harmed the habitat for both birds and 
alligators 
the woodstork heron ibis egret and roseate spoonbill have 
all declined dramatically over the years bush said the 
florida panther the alligator and many species of fish are 
declining 
the northeast shark river slough the river of grass through 
southern florida has been both too shallow and too deep the 
president said through this legislation that river of grass may 
now be restored to its natural flow of water 
congress first enacted legislation in 1944 to create everglades 
national park and it was dedicated by president harry truman in 
1947 
efforts to drain and reclaim wetlands from the 1880s through the 
1930s drastically reduced the natural flow of water through the 
everglades the army corp of engineers central and southern florida 
project in 1948 helped reduce the damaging flow of salt water and 
provided flood control but left some areas with too much water and 
others with too little 
the new legislation will require the corps to modify the central 
and southern florida project at an estimated cost of 45 million 
it also puts limits on the use of waterboats in the everglades 
with current users allowed to keep using the craft on existing 
routes

nasa said wednesday it had delayed 
the prechristmas launch of space shuttle columbia at least two 
days because of lagging work at the launch pad 
a statement said the new date of dec 20 is success 
oriented meaning that any minor new problem could slip the 
liftoff to the 21st 
it said additional time is needed to validate systems on 
recently renovated launch pad 39a and to prepare columbia 
we feel confident about readiness for a prechristmas 
liftoff said william lenoir nasas associate administrator for 
space flight 
nasa spokesman karl kristofferson said a lot of small problems 
many associated with new pad facilities had put launch crews 
behind schedule 
if liftoff slipped to christmas eve or christmas day it 
probably would be postponed a few more days to free workers for the 
holiday 
with the change the shuttle swapped launch dates with a titan 3 
commercial rocket that had been scheduled for liftoff on dec 20 
the titan which is to boost british and japanese communications 
satellites was rescheduled for 720 pm est monday 
during a 10day mission columbias five astronauts are to put a 
navy communications satellite into orbit and recover a science 
satellite before it falls to earth the satellite has been in orbit 
nearly six years and is expected to reenter the atmosphere in 
february 
the flight duration will equal the longest shuttle mission to 
date and will be a stepping stone for even longer flights as 
columbia is being modified to stay aloft for 16 days and later for 
28 days 
loading of propellants for columbias inflight propulsion 
systems and auxiliary power units began a day late monday because a 
faulty connector on an electronics box had to be replaced 
once the fueling began the launch pad had to be cleared of all 
nonessential personnel because it is dangerous that prevented 
workers from making up lost time in other areas 
work was running late even before the connector problem because 
of difficulties working with new systems on a mobile launch 
platform being used for the first time and with the launch pad 
which recently underwent a twoyear 50 million refurbishment 
receiving 130 modifications 
in announcing a dec 18 launch date nasa cautioned last week 
that the flight might have to be delayed a day or so because of the 
new systems 
astronaut dan brandenstein will command columbias crew the 
other crew members are pilot jim wetherbee and mission specialists 
bonnie dunbar marsha ivins and david low

even militant antiapartheid 
leaders acknowledge that president fw de klerk during four 
months in power has moved faster toward political reform than any 
of his predecessors 
but leading activists remain deeply suspicious of him 
suggesting he wants to ease international pressure on south africa 
without forfeiting the white minoritys ultimate hold on power 
de klerk 53 is viewed as an affable pragmatist earnest but 
not charismatic 
he has pledged to phase out discrimination and has not shied 
away from confrontations with rightwing whites who want to 
maintain strict apartheid however he maintains his longstanding 
belief that south african politics must be conducted along racial 
lines 
de klerk was a lawyer before entering parliament in 1973 from 
1978 he held a series of cabinet posts and in 1982 took on the 
powerful job of national party leader in the transvaal south 
africas most populous and wealthiest province 
pw botha who had headed the government since 1978 suffered a 
stroke in january and de klerk was elected to replace him as 
overall leader of the party botha remained in the presidency until 
august when he quit after the cabinet failed to support his 
objections to a planned diplomatic trip by de klerk to zambia 
de klerk comes from a long line of national party politicians 
going back to his greatgrandfather who was a senator

the united states recorded its best trade 
performance in almost six years from july through september as the 
deficit in the broadest measure of trade shrank 29 percent to 
2269 billion the government reported wednesday 
the commerce department said the current account deficit 
narrowed by 940 billion from a second quarter imbalance of 3208 
billion reflecting a big jump in the overseas earnings of us 
companies 
but economists discounted the huge swing saying it did nothing 
to change their view that americas trade deficit will remain stuck 
at a high level through most of the next decade 
however analysts were more upbeat about a second report 
wednesday showing that retail sales spurred by strong spending on 
clothing and furniture jumped 08 percent in november the biggest 
gain in four months 
some economists said the surprisingly strong sales report at 
the start of the allimportant christmas sales season should help 
alleviate fears that the economy could be on the verge of tumbling 
into a recession 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but also trade in services the category that 
includes investment earnings between countries 
for the third quarter the services category registered a 
surplus of 872 billion after posting a 166 billion deficit from 
april through june the first services deficit in three decades 
but the services swing from deficit to surplus was attributed 
almost totally to changes in the value of the dollar in the third 
quarter the dollar was declining meaning that the profits us 
companies earn in foreign currencies were worth more when they were 
translated into dollars 
in the second quarter a rising dollar had eaten into the 
profits americans companies were earning in foreign currencies 
the big swing in services helped offset a small increase in the 
merchandise trade deficit which climbed 07 percent to 2775 
billion in the third quarter and a rise in foreign aid and pension 
payments the other category of the current account which climbed 
to 366 billion an increase of 27 percent 
analysts forecast that the merchandise trade deficit will remain 
at stubbornly high levels in coming years and predicted that the 
services account will dip permanently into deficit sometime early 
in the 1990s reflecting the fact that the united states is now the 
worlds largest debtor nation 
as residents of a debtor nation americans hold less in overseas 
assets than foreigners hold in us assets americas net debtor 
position stood at 5325 billion at the end of last year and is 
expected to worsen by an additional 100 billion this year 
that means that more and more us wealth must be transferred 
into foreign hands in the form of interest payments and profits 
earned by foreign companies doing business in the united states 
the net debtor number is clearly moving in the wrong 
direction said david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill 
we are still borrowing money from overseas and that means that 
our interest payments to foreigners will be going up 
at the start of this decade the united states was running 
surpluses in its current account because earnings from american 
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in 
merchandise trade 
but as americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign 
hands to pay for merchandise imports the investment cushion shrank 
rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united states 
became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
wyss said the third quarter current account deficit the 
smallest since a 209 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 
1984 could be the last good news in this trade measure for some 
time 
through the first nine months of this year the current account 
deficit was running at an annual rate of 11355 billion down only 
modestly from the 12655 billion deficit recorded in 1988 
the government is scheduled to report friday the monthly 
merchandise trade figure for october the first look at how trade 
is doing in the fourth quarter 
bruce steinberg an economist at merrill lynch predicted that 
the october deficit figure could surge to 98 billion up from a 
september deficit of 79 billion he predicted the monthly 
merchandise trade deficit would likely remain stuck at the 9 
billion level for many months

the fda is urging consumers not to use an 
overthecounter food supplement distributed by a pennsylvania 
company because some bottles contain capsules with potentially 
fatal levels of stannous fluoride 
vitamin specialities co of wyncote pa has asked its 22 
retail stores in new york new jersey and pennsylvania to recall 
acidophilus capsules with lot number 069296 and has notified 140 
mailorder customers the food and drug administration said 
the product is manufactured by vitapure the fda said in a 
release 
according to the product label the acidophilus capsules supply 
friendly bacteria to the intestinal tract and help restore and 
maintain the mucous membrane that lines the stomach and intestines 
the company began the recall in late october after two consumers 
complained of vomiting and flulike symptoms after using the 
product the fda said however fda said it was concerned that many 
consumers may still be unaware of the problem because only a small 
number of bottles were returned 
an fda analysis found that smaller capsules were mixed with 
slightly larger acidophilus capsules the smaller capsules were 
found to have an average 784 milligrams of stannous fluoride 
stannous fluoride used in toothpaste is safe in small amounts 
however a 784milligram dose could cause convulsions in an adult 
and could be lethal for a small child the agency said five 
capsules could kill an adult 
high doses of stannous fluoride can cause gastrointestinal upset 
and vomiting which could limit the amount ingested and the adverse 
effects the fda said

secretary of state james a baker iii 
appealed to the worlds wealthiest countries wednesday to make good 
on their promises of aid to poland and hungary so the new leaders 
in eastern europe can put food on the table and goods on the 
shelves of stores 
baker described the plight of poland as winter approaches as 
severe 
pledges alone arent enough he told a meeting of two dozen 
foreign ministers as they committed their treasuries to a 
coordinated assistance program valued at up to 6 billion in the 
next several years 
most of the aid takes the form of investment and trade credits 
not to be paid out immediately included in the assistance is a 
200 million us contribution to a 1 billion stablization fund 
for poland 
additionally baker announced the united states would provide 
200 million to a 10nation 500 million bridge loan for poland 
that is to help tide the country past the christmas season until 
the international monetary fund declares it qualifies for a 
comprehensive aid program 
except for the 200 million which comes out of a us treasury 
fund congress last month appropriated 938 million in us 
assistance 
baker a former us treasury secretary has taken the lead 
within the bush administration in encouraging eastern european 
countries to adopt market economies as a lure he dangles us aid 
just before coming to brussels baker went to east germany for 
talks with reformist prime minister hans modrow he promised the 
administration would consider economic support if the country 
continued to revise its economy and carried out a pledge to hold 
multiparty elections in may 
baker told the foreign ministers that the multiplying effects 
of people power are creating a new eastwest equation ordinary men 
and women are peacefully asserting their basic human rights on a 
scale unimagined at the start of the year 
but baker went on it is our task to support this courageous 
reform effort after the streets emplty of demonstrators after the 
people select new leaders after governments become the servants of 
the people after all this the economies must put food on the

said 
the boys ages 14 and 15 were also suspended after authorities 
discovered the grenades monday and tuesday at rogers park junior 
high school 
the state police bomb squad determined the grenades about 20 
years old were used by the military to simulate battle conditions 
while the grenades do not break up and spread shrapnel when they 
explode they could kill someone said youth bureau detective 
russell benjamin 
he said the grenades could be less stable and more dangerous 
because they are old

presidents calling the decision a tragic missed opportunity 
to end the bloodshed 
the five presidents meeting in costa rica earlier this week 
appealed to the fmln rebels to immediately and effectively cease 
hostilities and rejoin the previously initiated process of 
dialogue 
a communique issued by the presidents called on the insurgents 
to use the dialogue to achieve their demobilization and expressed 
explicit support for the salvadoran government 
the rebels angrily denounced the communique ruling out 
demobilization they said the communique gives unconditional 
support to the principal violator of human rights in the region 
the salvadoran government 
the insurgents said they cannot be demobilized because they 
constitute a legitimate force with popular support in the entire 
salvadoran territory 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said the rebel 
statement represents a tragic missed opportunity to end the 
bloodshed which has plagued el salvador 
he contrasted the insurgents stand with that of president 
alfredo cristiani who has expressed a willingness to reopen talks 
with the fmln once they end their attacks in civilian areas 
discussing the nicaraguan aspect of the peace process boucher 
noted that the presidents called for the renewal of ceasefire 
talks between the sandinistas and the contra rebels he said those 
discussions broke down last month when the sandinistas unilaterally 
walked out 
if the sandinistas wish to further the goals of the peace 
process including voluntary demobilization repatriation and 
reintegration of resistance members under secure and democratic 
conditions they should renew their direct talks with the 
resistance he said 
he added that the sandinistas should also take immediate steps 
toward further democratization especially ending the harassment 
and violence against opposition candidates and supporters and 
freeing political prisoners 
in a concession to the sandinistas the presidents also called 
on the united states to transfer to a united nationsorganization 
of american states commission us funds being provided to the 
contras for food clothing shelter and medical supplies 
boucher said us officials would consult closely with central 
american united nations and contra officials to determine how best 
to carry out that aspect of the presidents communique 
the important thing is that we believe these people the 
contras continue to need food clothing and medicine thats 
exactly what we are providing boucher said

more than 96 percent of raw foods sold in the 
united states in 1988 had no pesticide residues or had levels 
within the legal limit the food and drug administration said 
wednesday 
thats a slight increase over 1987 when 95 percent of the foods 
sampled did not contain illegally high levels of pesticides 
the fdas analysis also showed that 61 percent of the foods 
sampled in 1988 had no pesticide residues compared with 57 percent 
the previous year 
of the nearly 4 percent of foods sampled in the 1988 analysis 
that contained pesticide residues above the levels allowed most 
involved residues for which the environmental protection agency has 
set no tolerance level the fda said 
the fda sampled 18114 imported and domestic food products for 
its latest report about 25 percent more than in 1987 
the analysis found more imports contained higherthanallowed 
pesticide residues than domestic foods of the 10475 import 
samples analyzed 6 percent contained excessive residues while 
about 2 percent of the 7639 samples of domestic foods exceeded the 
tolerance level or contained residues of pesticides not permitted 
for use on that product the fda said 
the study covered 256 pesticides 
vegetables had the highest proportion of excessive pesticide 
residues at 56 percent a breakdown shows that 7 percent of 
imported vegetables fall into that category compared with less than 
3 percent of domestic products

next year mrs miller plans to hang a decoration outside a 
lighted sleigh pulled by eight tiny pigs 
she got the idea of decorating the pig parlor four years ago 
when a litter of pigs was born on christmas eve 
it is a happy time of year she said everybody ought to 
enjoy it 
mrs miller said she thought it was appropriate to decorate the 
parlor because other barnyard animals were in the manger when 
christ was born 
ive always thought there were pigs in the manger scene she 
said i bet they were there we just didnt see them

this tiny ozarks community proudly calls itself 
missouris christmas city but theres little holiday cheer 
this season because the murder of the towns popular bank president 
remains unsolved 
more than two months have passed since dan short was kidnapped 
from his home in predawn darkness and forced to open the state bank 
of noel vault for his abductors who took about 70000 
his kidnappers taped him to a chair weighted with concrete 
blocks and a 30pound chain then threw him from a bridge into an 
oklahoma lake where he drowned 
the fbi says it has no suspects and few leads many people in 
the town of 1200 near the arkansas and oklahoma borders believe 
the odds of finding shorts killers shrink daily because of the 
lack of suspects and evidence 
the consensus of people who come in and out of my post office 
is it will go unsolved postmaster bill poage said 
nearly every door on festively decorated main street bears a 
yellow ribbon to signify were waiting for dans killers to be 
caught said dan coleman who bought his hardware store with a 
loan from shorts bank 
the 51yearold president of the towns lone bank is remembered 
as a genuine nice guy and community booster 
after moving to noel in 1986 short did commentary on radio 
broadcasts of high school sporting events and wrote a weekly sports 
column for an area newspaper 
only hours before he was abducted short agreed to be master of 
ceremonies at the community christmas parade for the third 
consecutive year 
he was the kind of guy who instead of sending someone to get 
the mail each morning would walk to the post office and get it 
himself coleman said 
fbi special agent max geiman said investigators have not found 
anyone in shorts 24year banking career who might want to kill him 
what investigators do know is this 
about 3 am on oct 6 a vehicle believed to be carrying three 
men drove to shorts home about five miles southwest of noel 
short who lived alone was awakened and forcibly driven to the 
bank 
someone also drove shorts pickup truck to the bank 
two shots from a 45caliber revolver disabled the banks 
surveillance camera and the lens was spraypainted 
short opened the vault and his abductors scooped up cash 
police will say only that it was in the neighborhood of 70000 
mostly in 5 and 2 bills and quarters 
the fbi believes the kidnappers intended all along to kill short 
after he opened the vault they bound his hands and feet with duct 
tape taped him to an antique chair and tossed him from a bridge 
into grand lake of the cherokees about 10 miles west of noel his 
body was found five days later 
gerald elkins a reporter for the mcdonald county press 
portrayed short in a reenactment of the crime for the syndicated 
television series hard copy 
when they tied me up and tipped me over the bridge i knew 
there was no danger of me falling but it was still frightening 
he said at that point dan short knows hes going to get killed 
you know he was scared to death 
floodlights have gone up around homes since shorts murder said 
donald duncan shorts friend and golf partner the closeknit 
community will probably never feel totally safe again he said 
many fear that short knew his killers and that they are still in 
the area the fbi has not ruled out that possibility geiman said 
banks in at least three states have posted a 50000 reward and 
geiman said the fbi is optimistic the case will eventually be 
solved 
meanwhile residents are trying to get on with their lives 
hoping that the killers will eventually be brought to justice 
its with you 24 hours a day but you have to get your mind 
back on business duncan said life goes on

the presidential race has taken a turn 
for the nasty with a campaign spot in which a candidates 
exgirlfriend charges he offered her money to get an abortion when 
she was pregnant with their daughter 
he ruined my life said miriam cordeiro referring to 
socialist candidate luis inacio lula da silva in an ad broadcast 
on tuesday and wednesday 
in addition to talking about their relationship and the couples 
illegitimate 15yearold daughter ms cordeiro also said da silva 
known as lula was a racist and couldnt stand blacks a 
majority of brazils 150 million people are black or mixedrace 
the ad was made by lulas opponent fernando collor de mello of 
the conservative national reconstruction party ms cordeiro says 
in the spot that her testimony was voluntary but a former campaign 
worker for collor de mello claims the woman was paid about 23000 
for her participation 
i couldnt remain silent facing a case of corruption said 
the worker maria helena amaral adding she had quit collor de 
mellos campaign staff after the interview 
the brazilian press has roundly condemned collor de mellos 
tactics 
the campaign reaches the bottom the respected daily 
newspaper folha de sao paulo said wednesday 
lulas campaign coordinator vladimir pomar called the 
interview baixaria a low blow 
the candidate says his daughter lurian was born after an 
affair with ms cordeiro following the death of his first wife in 
1969 the press earlier this year discovered lurian but 
brazilians did not react strongly to the disclosure 
he offered me money to get an abortion ms cordeiro said in 
the spot when she was born i put her in his lap and said now 
go ahead and kill her because when she was in my belly i wouldnt 
let you 
lula in his own tv spot wednesday was shown standing beside 
lurian who was wearing the redstar button of lulas 
marxistoriented workers party 
lurian was the product of a gesture of love the stocky 
bearded lula said to me all that matters is what my daughter 
thinks of me she knows what kind of a father she has 
after his affair with ms cordeiro lula remarried with marisa 
leticia the widow of a slain taxi driver who has one son the da 
silvas had three more sons and mrs da silva takes part in lulas 
campaign rallies 
the personal accusations were seen as a response to polls 
showing lula rapidly catching up as sundays runoff election 
approaches collor de mello previously has portrayed his rival as a 
communist and a proponent of armed struggle 
a poll published wednesday by the respected brazilian institute 
of public opinion and statistics showed collor de mello held a slim 
4 percentage point lead over lula just 10 days ago polls had 
collor de mello leading by 15 points 
in the latest survey the institute interviewed 3650 people in 
their homes between dec 8 and dec 12 it showed 47 percent of 
those questioned preferred collor de mello and 43 percent supported 
lula the margin of error was 2 percent 
the two candidates were the top votegetters in a 21candidate 
field in the firstround election nov 15 neither candidate won a 
majority and a runoff was set for sunday 
political analysts said the new ad shows how worried collor de 
mellos supporters are 
with the desperation of someone who sees a certain victory 
endangered collor de mello has assumed a rightwing posture 
of order vs chaos he has made the campaign an ideological 
showdown political columnist ricardo noblat wrote tuesday in the 
jornal do brasil newspaper of rio 
the election is brazils first popular balloting for president 
in 29 years the last free vote was in 1960 when janio quadros was 
elected he resigned after seven months in office and three years 
later the armed forces took power in a coup and ruled the country 
until 1985 
civilian president jose sarney was chosen by an electoral 
college controlled by the outgoing generals

bringing four military hand grenades to junior high school police 
said 
the boys ages 14 and 15 were also suspended after authorities 
discovered the grenades monday and tuesday at rogers park junior 
high school 
the state police bomb squad determined the grenades about 20 
years old were used by the military to simulate battle conditions 
while the grenades do not break up and spread shrapnel when they 
explode they could kill someone said youth bureau detective 
russell benjamin 
he said the grenades could be less stable and more dangerous 
because they are old

principal william spielberg said a student alerted school 
officials to the first grenade and the school called police

a random call by a phone surveyer working 
the night shift in iowa rescued an arizona man from an apparent 
suicide attempt 
carol edwards 39 was making random calls nationwide monday

the slurred voice of a man said my cars in the garage and so 
am i said juan perez a tempe police spokesman

thought maybe it was i joke i was hoping it was she conferred 
with her supervisor chuck sitter at frank n magid associates a 
consulting and research firm in marion iowa 
we called the tempe police department and they said they were 
happy we did said sitter 27 
within minutes of sitters call officer alison miller arrived 
at the tempe home and found it seemingly unoccupied although a 
cassette recording repeatedly was playing the countrywestern song 
ill be missing you 
i thought i heard a car and went straight for the garage it 
was dark in there and i turned on a flashlight i saw a man 
kneeling beside the drivers door his head was slumped but his 
hands were hanging onto the window ms miller recalled adding 
that the cars fumes were pretty strong like it had been running 
for awhile 
the man apparently was attempting suicide by carbonmonoxide

police believe the 42yearold man was having family problems 
marital problems perez said 
the man was given emergency room treatment then transferred to 
a psychiatric hospital where officials declined to discuss the 
matter wednesday 
what are the chances of this person in iowa calling a random 
number in tempe and getting a recording describing a suicide 
attempt perez asked 
and what are the chances of listening to the recording and not 
hanging up he said of ms edwards a lot of people hate 
talking to recorders

a powerful rebel group negotiating 
with the government for political power ousted a rival militia 
wednesday in a battle that killed an estimated 60 people mostly 
militiamen residents said 
in a threepronged attack launched shortly before midnight 
tuesday the liberation tigers of tamil eelam surrounded the town 
of batticaloa residents said 
one young woman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
rebels came down the coast road from the lagoon and the jungle late 
tuesday night by midmorning wednesday she said the shooting had 
stopped 
by sundown wednesday batticaloas general hospital had received 
26 bodies 
only one was a tiger a hospital official said the rest 
were from the other side 
like many other people in this town of 60000 people he was 
reluctant to speak the name of the other side but they 
acknowledged they meant the tamil national army a group set up 
shortly before the indian peacekeeping forces withdrew from 
batticaloa late last month 
most of them according to parents were forcibly conscripted 
to fight the tigers one hospital employee said 
the sri lankan government has accused departing indian troops 
at the behest of proindian tamil groups of training and arming 
the tamil army which the colombo government has outlawed 
the indian government which sent peacekeeping soldiers to sri 
lanka two years ago to put down the tamil rebellion has denied 
allegations it created the tamil national army 
in addition to the 26 bodies at batticaloa general hospital 
three more were seen along the road leading into town 
young tiger guerrillas most in their teens and carrying shining 
new ak47 assault rifles claimed at least 50 members of the tamil 
national army were killed in the battle 
wellplaced residents in batticaloa estimate the total death 
toll at 50 to 60 one said it might be as high as 90 
the bodies have been pouring in all day and still they are 
arriving the hospital official said more will come when it is 
light again and people can find transport 
the last of the bodies to reach the hospital as darkness fell 
lay on the floors of vans parked inside the hospitals front gate 
at least three had their hands tied behind their backs in the 
fading light their wounds were not clearly visible but all 
appeared to have been shot in the head or neck 
my husband i have lost my husband wailed nathivathany in 
between sobs that shook her entire body 
nathivathanys husband thayaparan was one of the young men 
whose bodies lay in a heap in the back of the van friends said the 
young couple had been married only a short time 
but elsewhere in the town there was an air of calm with 
teenage tigers standing along the streets in twos and fours 
redandwhite banners erected by the tigers proclaimed great 
heroes days in the tamil language 
the tigers were very polite when they came into town after the 
shooting said an englishspeaking woman people gave them tea 
and said we had dreams for the liberation of batticaloa 
eighteen months ago people of batticaloa compained about our 
tamil militia including the tigers saying they had been forced 
to contribute money provide free food and even their own 
television sets said the woman also speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
but as the tigers tried to enter the political mainstream they 
also had embarked on a public relations campaign one that seems to 
be working the tamil national army does not enjoy the same support 
batticaola is 135 miles east of colombo and is one of the two 
eastern districts where india pulled out 10000 of its troops in 
the past two months india has said the remaining 26000 troops 
will be out of sri lanka by dec 31

an american church worker 
accused of storing weapons for leftist rebels in el salvador was 
released from prison today into the custody of the us ambassador 
president alfredo cristiani said jennifer casolo 28 of 
thomaston conn was released after 2 weeks in jail because of 
insufficient evidence and would be deported he said she would be 
asked to remain a witness in the case 
if the evidence against her becomes sufficient she will be 
summoned to return for trial cristiani told a news conference 
although he acknowledged little could be done to force her to 
return 
shortly afterwards reporters staking out the ilopango prison 
saw ms casolo leave in a black cadillac with us ambassador 
william walker the cadillac was escorted by a caravan of jeeps 
there was no opportunity for ms casolo to comment and no 
indication where the caravan was headed 
cristiani said he thought ms casolo probably had in fact 
cooperated with rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front who launched a major urban offensive in san salvador last 
month 
cristiani said she was being released only because legally there 
was not enough evidence to hold her 
i am morally convinced that miss casolo is guilty cristiani 
said he said she was being freed only because of lack of evidence 
the president said he had not been pressured by the government 
of the united states to order ms casolos release the united 
states is a key financial supporter of the rightist government in 
its war with the rebels 
ms casolo was charged with acts of terrorism possessing 
weapons of war and criminal association she denied the charges 
sen christopher dodd dconn said earlier today he had been 
told in telephone conversations with salvadoran officials 
including cristiani that ms casolo would be released and expelled 
from the country by thursday afternoon 
cristiani informs me that the judge in her case has ultimately 
concluded the charges against jennifer were not fully supported by 
the evidence and that she could not thus be fairly prosecuted 
under salvadoran law dodd said in a statement released by his 
office 
ms casolo went to el salvador in 1985 to work for christian 
education seminars a group that organizes tours for americans to 
learn about the 10yearold civil war 
ms casolo and two salvadoran friends were arrested nov 26 
after a police raid on her house in san salvador from the walled 
garden behind the house police said they uncovered 103 mortar 
grenades 213 blocks of dynamite 405 detonators 150 feet of 
slowburning fuse and 21945 rounds of ammunition for sovietmade 
automatic rifles 
ms casolo is to be expelled from el salvador according to the 
agreement reached with salvadoran officials dodd said 
on tuesday el salvadors ambassador to the united states 
miguel angel salaverria said ms casolo would be released if she 
provided police with information about the people from whom she 
rented her house

sirens wailed across poland at noon 
wednesday to mark the eighth anniversary of the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown which lech walesa declared should be a reminder of the 
need for pluralism and tolerance 
hundreds of young people took to the streets in five cities 
however hurling rocks and firebombs to express anger at the 
crackdown and demand punishment for those responsible 
in the most open discussion to date of the decision newspapers 
were filled with articles examining gen wojciech jaruzelskis dec 
13 1981 declaration to suppress the solidarity labor movement 
before december 1981 solidarity did not appreciate the 
strength of the authorities jaruzelski told solidaritys gazeta 
wyborcza newspaper after december 1981 the authorities did not 
appreciate the strength of solidarity 
in the crackdown carried out with military precision 
communication to the outside world was cut thousands of solidarity 
activists were rounded up and interned the union was ordered 
suspended and at least nine miners died resisting authorities 
eight years after the event solidarity has not only regained 
legal status but it has taken control of the government from the 
communist party however activists allowed jaruzelski to be 
elected president in july with the minimum number of votes required 
while older solidarity activists approached the anniversary 
somberly hundreds of demonstrators in katowice hurled firebombs 
and paint at the doors of the provincial party headquarters state 
radio reported 
in szczecin several hundred teenagers rallied and marched to 
police headquarters where they burned jaruzelski in effigy chanted 
down with communism and threw stones and bottles at the 
building before police turned water cannons on them radio said 
a group of demonstrators attacked police headquarters with 
stones in wroclaw and officers responded with truncheons the state 
pap news agency reported smaller anticommunist marches also took 
place outside the national communist party headquarters in warsaw 
and according to state television in krakow 
in his message to mark the anniversary walesa muted his 
criticism while stressing that there should be efforts at 
reconciliation 
whether polish national interests required the implementation of 
martial law is a question that belongs to historians walesa 
said 
however one does not need scientific analysis to see the 
senselessness of the human losses and persecutions the campaign of 
slanders and humiliations the cult of force and the pacifying of 
public life 
today the tragedy of martial law reminds us of the need for 
cultured politics pluralism and tolerance the dramatic 
experiences of those days cannot be repeated because among other 
things we are wiser from those experiences 
the tragedy of martial law cannot overshadow the future and 
the squaring of accounts cannot replace the striving for a just and 
prosperous poland walesa said 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said the date 
has deep meaning for her especially sitting in a government where 
literally those who eight years ago were arrested and those who 
gave and signed the orders sit side by side 
the fact the two sides could overcome their differences proves 
that those eight years which were very hard and brought a lot of 
misfortunes were not wasted they became a lesson for both sides 
the communist side became convinced that without the participation 
of society it is not possible to govern the opposition was shown 
that relentlessness in striving for freedom has got to be combined 
with political realism

solidarity had called on factories nationwide to sound sirens at 
noon in memory of the day still vividly and painfully remembered 
among those interviewed by the communist party weekly polityka 
were col wieslaw gornicki jaruzelskis close aide who said at 
the time he believed martial law was inevitable although today he 
is unsure whether moderates on both sides could have prevented it 
gornicki said the public should remember soviet pressure on 
poland and soviet leader leonid i brezhnevs threats about 
which the public still knows too little 
at a march 1982 meeting with jaruzelski brezhnev sneered 
that martial law was a lamentable half measure and authorities 
should be even tougher gornicki said 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak whose police and riot troops 
carried out the crackdown told the newspaper he regrets the 
injustice and harm that people feel but that as a historical 
experience martial law turned out to be educative and valuable 
from this experience stems the success of dialogue and todays 
essentially changing poland he said 
in a commentary gazeta wyborcza said it is possible to discuss 
martial law in a calmer way 
justified nonviolent resistance to martial law and loyalty to 
solidarity through the difficult years finally allowed a historic 
breakthrough it said though the price we have had to pay is 
great all those years were not a lost time

what appeared to be a prank call to the 
police turned out to be a very wrong number for a drug dealer 
it was kind of a humorous situation said ken carter of the 
narcotics division of the states department of public safety 
here we have this mope thats calling us and he has no idea of 
who he is talking to 
public safety commissioner gene shepard said it all began when 
the phone rang in the agencys narcotics division 
the guy said something like is al there and our agent 
said no this is john said shepard 
the suspect then went on to describe a drug transaction that had 
apparently been arranged with the mysterious al at first agents 
thought it was a nuisance call but the suspect became insistent 
carter said 
it proceeded to the point where we decided this guy was 
serious he really wanted to sell drugs said carter so we 
started with the roleplaying 
after the agents went through the requisite haggling a 
transaction was set up allowing undercover agents to purchase a 
small amount of marijuana 
the buy was set up for tuesday in des moines and two men were 
charged with delivery of marijuana carter said the transaction 
involved about four ounces of the drug 
once in a while we have an interesting day around here said 
shepard its not every day you arrest two people just on a wrong 
number

two dozen western nations that are 
coordinating a massive aid package for hungary and poland on 
wednesday offered similar help to other east european nations 
moving toward democracy and market economies 
the foreign ministers of the 24 nations ending a oneday 
meeting said they would respond positively to those nations 
shedding communism 
the 24 would welcome requests for aid from other states 
the ministers said they mentioned east germany czechoslovakia 
bulgaria and yugoslavia 
the donor countries including the 12 european community 
nations the united states japan australia and canada 
stressed the importance of the economic and political reform 
process in the soviet union 
but they did not overtly offer aid to moscow sources said 
moscow may need more aid than any other east european nation but 
it would have been diplomatically unwise to put it on the list of 
wouldbe recipient nations 
us secretary of state james a baker iii told the meeting we 
cannot ignore democratic reforms elsewhere in eastern europe 
these showed our efforts at coordinating western responses are 
addressing only the first phase of the challenge of economic and 
political reform in eastern europe he said 
western aid for poland and hungary is being coordinated by the 
ec at the request of the leaders of the seven most industrialized 
nations who met in paris in july well before the reform movements 
in other east european nations began to take root 
to date officials said aid totaling up to 6 billion over 
several years has been granted or committed to poland and hungary 
it ranges from emergency food to longterm export and investment 
credits 
on wednesday the united states west germany japan and nine 
other countries formally underwrote a stabilization fund of 1 
billion to prop up the zloty the polish currency and help make it 
convertible 
west germany will pay 250 million to the fund the united 
states 200 million and japan 150 million 
britain france and italy will each contribute 100 million and 
the remainder will come from canada spain portugal switzerland 
austria and turkey 
baker called the fund critical for the success of the currency 
and price reforms in poland 
the fund is also taking on symbolic importance for the poles 
an indicator of whether the west will in fact stand with them when 
they make hard economic decisions he added 
he said in addition to paying into the stabilization fund the 
united states is granting poland another 800 million in a range of 
programs including investment credits food and medical aid and 
trade guarantees 
poland has a foreign debt of 40 billion hungarys is half 
that yet it is the highest per capita in eastern europe 
the 24 donor nations also discussed a 1 billion loan to help 
improve the hungarian economy some are considering creating a 
development bank for eastern europe 
the hungarian loan will be made once budapest accepts 
international monetary fund conditions to overhaul its economy 
which would also free funds from the world bank and other western 
sources 
both hungary and poland are near an agreement with the imf 
imf managing director michel camdessus said monday a letter of 
intent for a 700 million loan agreement with poland could be 
initialed this week 
the united states will put 200 million toward a 500 million 
temporary loan for poland as it awaits help from the imf the white 
house said 
polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski and gyula horn 
his hungarian counterpart outlined to the western donors their 
economic reforms 
one of our most important aims is to shape a healthy 
enterprise structure horn said our top priority is to 
maintain the countrys creditworthiness and to assure access to 
normal market financial resources that enable us to fulfill our 
farreaching political and economic objectives 
skubiszewski outlined his countrys efforts to demonopolize 
the polish economy by opening wider the doors to free 
enterprise

the former chairman of japans largest company told 
a court wednesday he was engaging in a normal japanese business 
deal not being bribed when he accepted discountpriced stocks 
from a firm accused of buying favors 
the trial of hisashi shinto 79 former chairman of nippon 
telegraph and telephone corp which began wednesday in tokyo 
district court is the fourth of five scheduled trials in the 
recruit bribery scandal 
defendants in the fifth trial to begin friday are hiromasa 
ezoe founder and former chairman of the recruit co information 
services conglomerate and two politicians accused of accepting 
bribes a total of 12 defendants are charged with bribery and could 
face five years in prison each if convicted 
ezoes company allegedly tried to win favors and influence in 
the top ranks of politics business and the bureaucracy the 
recruit scandal and trials have raised many questions about 
political giftgiving business practices and the close ties 
between government and business in japan 
parliament gave final approval wednesday to legislation 
providing punishment for politicians who make donations at 
weddings funerals and other events in their election districts 
without attending the event politicials have said constituents 
expect such donations 
under the new law which takes effect feb 1 violators can be 
sentenced to a year in prison or fined up to 200000 yen 1390 
shinto who testified before judge ken toyoda in the nojury 
trial accepted the prosecutions factual allegations that he made 
about 21 million yen 145000 in 1986 by buying shares in a 
recruit subsidiary at a belowmarket price before they were offered 
to the public 
i accepted the offer of shares but i never regarded it as a 
bribe shinto said he added that during his business career 
other companies had offered him similar shares as a sign of trust 
and longterm ties 
rejecting such an offer is considered rude in japan he said 
shinto denied doing special favors for recruit the prosecution 
alleged that recruit got favorable terms on telephone lines 
maintenance and other services 
the telecommunications market has become a free market and ntt 
is a private company shinto said i ordered all my employees 
to increase our services to our clients and i believe they did 
just that 
prosecutors also say shinto helped recruit obtain two usmade 
supercomputers and gave it special assistance recruit bought the 
supercomputers from shintos company in 1987 and 1988 after ntt 
bought them from cray research inc 
we were never asked by recruit to buy supercomputers from 
cray but rather it was done by ntt independently to correct the 
trade imbalance between japan and the united states and ntt asked 
recruit to buy them from us shinto said 
japanese business circles were stunned by shintos arrest in 
march he had a reputation for clean dealings and had seen his 
giant company through the change in 1985 from government to private 
ownership 
he resigned last december immediately after his involvement in 
the stock deal was disclosed 
the recruit scandal began in the summer of 1988 and caused the 
downfall of prime minister noboru takeshita who resigned last 
spring after acknowledging he received large donations from recruit 
other key figures in the governing liberal democratic party also 
have been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking 
bureaucrats also has been questioned because of gifts they accepted 
from recruit

a famed composer told parliament on wednesday that 
the new leningrad party chief is an opponent of president mikhail 
s gorbachevs reform and urged him to quit 
rodion shchedrin took the floor on the second day of the 
congress of peoples deputies to criticize a widely publicized 
meeting in the soviet unions second city last month that many 
soviets believe showed leningrad party leader boris v gidaspov to 
be a conservative opponent to the president 
i am of the opinion that the meeting was aimed at halting the 
revolutionary processes of perestroika in the country and there 
were plenty of threats hidden by fig leaves of eulogisms addressed 
against our leader and his supporters shchedrin said 
i think that your post is incompatible with what you have 
done he said addressing gidaspov 
gidaspov was chosen leningrad party leader this year to replace 
yuri f solovyev who was embarrassed in elections to the congress 
in march solovyev had no opposition but still lost because he 
received less than 50 percent of the vote 
gidaspov made an innocuous speech at the outdoor meeting which 
was shown on leningrad tv and later on a nationwide news program 
saying mainly that it was time to stop talking about reform and 
start acting 
however other speakers and some of the banners at the rally 
gave soviets a different picture some speakers sharply attacked 
cooperatives the small privately held businesses that are an 
important feature of gorbachevs economic reform banners called 
for top communist party officials to be brought to account for the 
countrys difficult political and economic situation 
gidaspov denied he was leading the leningrad party organization 
toward opposing gorbachevs reforms 
to make such statements before the high assembly that are 
based only on personal impressions seems to me not reasonable he 
said 
we consider the work of the leningrad party and public 
organizations as work aimed at speeding up perestroika he said 
gidaspov had come in for more heat about the outdoor meeting at 
a countermeeting of 40000 rankandfile leningrad communists 
last week when he tried to make a conciliatory speech to that 
meeting he was drowned out by shouts of resign resign

oliver north said wednesday that he does not 
want to be a government witness in the irancontra case against his 
former boss john poindexter 
poindexter was the only one who didnt hang ollie north 
out to dry during the congressional irancontra hearings north 
said at a pretrial hearing in the case against the former national 
security adviser 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements in the 
irancontra affair 
north in seven hours of testimony over two days said his 
perceptions of the irancontra affair had been influenced by 
poindexters capitol hill testimony given under a grant of 
immunity if us district judge harold greene agrees north could 
be barred from testifying 
defense lawyer richard beckler and greene pressed the former 
white house aide to provide specifics on how poindexters testimony 
tainted his perceptions 
im telling you i cant north said making it clear he 
would prefer not to testify at poindexters trial scheduled to 
begin jan 22 
i hoped i would never set foot in a courtroom ever again 
north said when asked why he hadnt reviewed his trial testimony in 
more detail before coming to court this week 
this is the fourth christmas that my family has had its door 
darkened by the independent counsels investigation and 
prosecution of the irancontra affair north said 
the former marine lieutenant colonel was convicted in may of 
three felonies in connection with the armsforhostages deal he is 
appealing that conviction 
greene said north is not a friendly witness not to the 
independent counsel he may be friendly to the defense but we 
dont know that either 
beckler will file court papers specifying instances in which 
north gave different testimony or more detailed testimony at his 
april trial compared with his 1987 congressional testimony norths 
congressional appearance preceded poindexters nationally televised 
testimony 
questioning north closely beckler did bring out that his 
recollection was affected by poindexters testimony in connection 
with poindexter tearing up a politically embarrassing policy 
statement that depicted the reagan administrations iran initiative 
as a straight armsforhostages deal 
north said his memory of the event was colored by the fact that 
poindexter acknowledged in his congressional testimony that he had 
destroyed the presidential document known as a finding nov 
20 1986 amid public scrutiny of the administrations arms sales 
to iran 
the presidential finding could have been any sheet of paper 
but for the fact that poindexter confirmed it in his 
congressional testimony north told beckler 
i dont know for a fact that the document destroyed that 
morning was the finding north said later when questioned by 
prosecutor michael bromwich 
north testified at his own trial that he watched poindexter rip 
up the document as thenattorney general edwin meese iii began 
focusing on a november 1985 ciaassisted shipment of hawk 
antiaircraft missiles to iran 
on wednesday however north said that he hadnt actually read 
the document when poindexter destroyed it 
the destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal 
charges against poindexter accused of falsely telling congress 
that he didnt learn of the missile shipment to iran until january 
1986 
the finding signed by president reagan in december 1985 was 
drafted because of the ciaassisted shipment the previous month

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
said wednesday he was fully in line with new us proposals for 
reshaping the western alliance in an era of a reduced security 
threat from the soviet union 
us secretary of state james a baker iii advanced the 
political proposals tuesday in berlin 
woerner spoke with reporters on the eve of a key meeting of the 
north atlantic treaty organization he said nato foreign ministers 
will discuss at their yearend meeting thursday and friday the 
political and economic changes in east europe particularly in east 
germany and czechoslovakia 
woerner said he strongly supported bakers call for nato to set 
up an arms control verification staff which would help western 
nations monitor compliance with future disarmament accords 
we cannot and will not ignore that the historic change we see 
all around us will have an impact on nato itself he said 
the alliance must continue to provide security and stability 
in a time of turbulence and must also be increasingly an 
instrument that can shape political change the nato chief added 
he said the ministers will be trying to encourage the reforms 
under way in the east as part of efforts to fashion a new 
architecture of europe which will allow the division of our 
continent to be peacefully overcome 
the meeting will cap weeks of highlevel talks among the 16 nato 
nations president bush met with other alliance leaders last week 
to brief them on his malta discussions with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the alliance nations have been discussing ways to make sure nato 
keeps pace with the changes in the east bush and baker have talked 
about a new europe and a new atlanticism 
in his berlin speech baker said natos political role should be 
enhanced as its military work diminishes 
he said an agreement between nato and the sovietled warsaw pact 
to reduce the buildup of conventional or nonnuclear weapons in 
europe was the keystone of this new security structure 
woerner said nato was determined to wrap up a conventional arms 
treaty with the seven warsaw pact nations next year 
the united states has been pressing for an agreement by june 
questions rose about the pace of the negotiations because of 
greek opposition to a compromise plan to exclude a turkish port 
from the area covered by the treaty the snag has held up nato 
plans to quickly put on the negotiating table in vienna a draft 
treaty for bargaining with the warsaw pact 
woerner said work was continuing to reach a timely accord 
despite the delay 
he said the ministers will give further impetus at their 
meeting to negotiations on the conventional armed forces in europe

the united states egypt and the plo are 
collaborating on a list of palestinians who could be sent to 
preliminary peace talks with israel an israeli legislator said 
wednesday 
aryeh eliav a member of parliament from the centerleft labor 
party made the comment after returning from a meeting in cairo 
with officials of the palestine liberation organization the 
officials included nabil shaat a top political aide to plo chief 
yasser arafat 
eliav said the intensive efforts in cairo are aimed at 
submitting palestinian names for israeli approval in washington 
next month as a step toward the first direct formal negotiations 
between israelis and palestinians 
the labor legislator is the first israeli official to confirm a 
report by the daily yediot ahronot on sunday saying 
behindthescenes peace contacts were under way despite israels 
insistence that the plo be excluded from the process israel 
considers the plo a terrorist group and officially refuses to hold 
talks with its members 
avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir has 
denied sundays newspaper report he also said israeli cabinet 
secretary eliakim rubinstein would go to washington this week to 
seek written us guarantees that the plo be excluded from peace 
efforts 
however eliav said egypt and the plo were already at work 
drawing up lists of names to present to the israeli and egyptian 
foreign ministers when they meet in january with us secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
the washington meeting called by baker for which no definite 
date has been set is supposed to set the stage for 
israelipalestinian talks in cairo about an israeli proposal to 
hold elections in the occupied territories 
there are some very very intensive efforts under way in cairo 
involving egypt the americans as advisers and the plo to 
comprise a delegation that israel can accept eliav said in a 
telephone interview 
israels denial of even indirect talks with the plo is false 
eliav added whoever thinks they are not partners that they are 
not involved in the process is living in a fools paradise like 
alice in wonderland he said 
eliav said he met shaat and the plo ambassador in cairo said 
kamal during a twoday symposium on the israelipalestinian 
dispute sponsored by the egyptian newspaper el ahram 
the plo was ready to be flexible about israeli demands 
eliav said 
i have the impression they understand they cannot allow 
themselves the luxury of selecting only the people they want and 
that they are putting together a list israel will find difficult to 
oppose people in the plo know they must not miss this boat 
eliav added 
he refused to provide names of prospective palestinian 
negotiators 
the israeli peace plan introduced in april calls for the 17 
million palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
elect representatives to negotiate interim selfrule the final 
status of the territories would be negotiated later 
the plo has balked at accepting the plan because it does not 
guarantee the palestinians independent statehood 
eliav declined to elaborate on his talks with plo officials amid 
radio reports he could be questioned on suspicion of violating a 
law that bars israelis from meeting with plo members the lawmaker 
said he had stayed within the bounds of the 1986 antiterrorist law 
because the meetings were held during a public conference

white house chief of staff john h sununu 
confessed to the national press club on wednesday that the bush 
administration has made a lot of mistakes some of them unreported 
doozies 
thus ended his confession 
sununu not only refused to shed light on the flubs but devoted 
most of an hour to a glowing review of the administration five 
weeks shy of its first birthday that left practically no 
superlative unsaid 
he called george bush probably the most underrated man in 
modern history to serve in the presidency 
sununu who said his aim was to influence the journalists 
yearend analyses said bush is getting raves too in polls that 
show his approval ratings in the midtohigh 70s numbers that 
truly are virtually unprecedented in history 
from the savings and loan bailout to the war on drugs bush has 
set the agenda and shown an ability to work with the 
democratcontrolled congress without sacrificing his principles 
the former new hampshire governor argued 
bush has really excelled in shaping and encouraging the 
dramatic changes toward democracy in the soviet bloc sununu said 
it was not an easy year george bush just made it seem easy 
said sununu 
he said bush has resisted the temptation to make instant 
foreign policy or snap conclusions 
the one thing the president understands is that you dont get 
extra credit for running out and doing it immediately on 
television he said 
he has handled the east bloc changes as one would handle 
landing a 10pound fish on 2pound line avoiding the temptation 
to jerk that line and to try to pull the fish in all at once 
sununu also hailed his boss as the master of the small 
gesture from inviting french president francois mitterrand to 
his kennebunkport maine seaside home to taking egyptian president 
hosni mubarak out to a baseball game to his countless hours on 
the telephone with foreign leaders 
sununu even suggested that the lunch bush held on his july visit 
to poland for both communist leaders and solidarity members laid 
the groundwork for the new solidarityled government in poland 
that in turn he said served as the catalyst for the very rapid 
change taking place in eastern europe 
under questioning sununu defended bushs controversial decision 
to send two top aides to china last saturday to rekindle ties with 
that communist government six months after a brutal crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
bush recognizes that theres a billion people there and he 
wanted to recreate a relationship that would allow whatever 
pressures we put on to be taken as credible said sununu 
asked about the possibility of us aid for east germany sununu 
said west germany will be the first to help and the nato allies 
will await evidence of internal changes before putting together any 
aid package like the one crafted for poland 
the administration has seldom seen internal quarrels spill out 
into the press and sununu was asked how the white house managed 
that a rare achievement in recent administrations 
it has a calm lowkeyed mildmannered chief of staff who 
doesnt get upset at anything said the imperious sununu evoking 
laughter loudest from his own aides 
any regrets weve made a lot of mistakes a couple of them 
youve caught most of them you havent there have been some 
doozies that you missed 
mmmmm how about an example his lips are sealed and he added 
im not even going to write a book

the government has decided to give ethnic germans 
and crimean tatars who were expelled from their homelands by josef 
stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years tass 
reported wednesday 
the ice has been broken a start has been made were working 
on creating such autonomy said rafik nishanov chairman of a 
chamber of the soviet legislature in remarks carried by the 
official news agency 
however he said the nuts and bolts of how to create the 
regions still had to be worked out for example a 10year 
program on resettlement people cant just be expelled from the 
area for others to move in 
the tatars of the crimea and the ethnic germans who lived on the 
volga river were forcibly resettled during world war ii when josef 
stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they 
could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas 
the tatars and germans among others long have been agitating 
to return from siberia and central asia to their traditional lands 
and last month the supreme soviet legislature declared that all 
peoples exiled under stalin should be considered politically 
rehabilitated 
but other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged 
to the exiles and reestablishing their dominion in their home 
regions will not be so simple 
the supreme soviet took the basic decision that the two 
autonmous regions should be created on nov 28 but kept it quiet 
apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now 
living in the regions it was also a potentially dangerous 
precedent the soviet union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic 
groups and many of them have outstanding territorial claims 
trouble already has been reported between ethnic germans and 
russians in several cities on the volga residents of the saratov 
and volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of 
the nations estimated 2 million germans descending on them 
ethnographers estimate there are some 500000 crimean tatars in 
the soviet union and another 1 million in turkey their protests 
near the kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their 
homeland were among the first tests of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs promises of greater democracy 
several thousand tatars have been filtering back to the crimea 
each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return 
a wave of some 100000 ethnic germans emigrated to west germany 
this year but many would probably stay if they could be assured of 
their own republic said irina ostroukh a researcher at the soviet 
institute of ethnography who studies ethnic germans 
the nov 28 plan approved by the supreme soviet recommended 
excluding from the german region areas where resistance to german 
resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts 
the explosive conflict between armenians and azerbaijanis over 
the nagornokarabakh region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of 
thousands of refugees in the last two years both sides claim 
control over the mountainous enclave 
the supreme soviet charged the government with creating a 
commmission to determine how to create the regions for the germans 
and crimean tatars

the chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
called wednesday for a 1 billion drive to develop antinarcotics 
medications saying the bush administration neglected that weapon 
in its war on drugs 
like aids drug abuse is a national health emergency that 
threatens thousands of american lives and damages the fabric of 
american society sen joseph r biden ddel told a news 
conference 
while no one expects to find a magic pill that eliminates drug 
addiction expert researchers agree that we could be doing more a 
lot more to develop new treatments he said 
biden said the nation should set goals of making a 
cocaineblocking medicine available by 1997 and providing 
pharmacotherapeutic treatmentondemand for heroin and cocaine 
addicts by the year 2000 
biden said he would introduce legislation that would launch a 1 
billion medications development program over the next decade 
provide drug companies with incentives to develop new treatments 
streamline government safety evaluations call on the surgeon 
general for a report on the issue and designate top priority 
research areas 
these top priority areas would include the use of 
pharmacotherapeutic agents on pregnant women and their fetuses 
treatments for new drugs that will appear in the 1990s and 
interaction between heroin and cocaine addiction 
biden unveiled a report from the committee staff that pinpointed 
eight new medicines that might be used to treat addiction some 
reduce drug craving while others merely substitute one addiction 
for another one actually blocks the pleasure addicts feel as a 
result of taking their drug

combined with pharmaceutical industry inaction and insufficient 
action by the administration to limit resources devoted to 
searching for new treatments

longfeuding neighbors egypt and libya have 
agreed to build roads linking the two nations share television 
programs and cooperate on farm and industrial projects news 
reports said wednesday 
broad agreement was reached on most of the projects during an 
october summit between president hosni mubarak and libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi 
egypts governmentowned news media reported wednesday that the 
two leaders reaffirmed the decisions tuesday during mubaraks 
oneday visit to sirte on libyas north coast

quickly since then and tuesdays meeting was the fourth summit

egypt supply technical expertise for libyan industry 
news reports initially said the two leaders agreed that libya 
join in an arabeuropean dialogue in paris on dec 2122 and 
coordinate its positions with egypt 
but the early editions of thursday newspapers in cairo later 
quoted the libyan leader as saying the issue was still under 
discussion by libyan officials 
french president francois mitterrand called for the paris 
meeting to allow the foreign ministers of the 22 arab league 
members and the 12 member states of the european community to focus 
on arab problems 
as reported by the governmentowned middle east news agency 
other libyanegyptian projects include egyptian help for desert 
reclamation projects in southeastern libya and construction of an 
80mile road connecting siwa oasis in egypts western desert with

jennifer casolos friends and parents 
expressed gratitude and relief wednesday at the news that the 
church worker was being released from the salvadoran prison where 
shed been held on terrorism charges 
i am deeply greatly grateful to each and every one who has 
believed in jennifer and her innocence her mother audrey 
casolo told a news conference in us sen christopher dodds 
whethersfield office just south of hartford 
casolo 28 was arrested nov 26 after a raid on her house in 
san salvador and was accused of storing weapons for leftist 
rebels police said they found thousands of rounds of sovietmade 
ammunition and other armaments in the garden behind her home 
salvadoran president alfredo christiani announced wednesday that 
casolo 28 had been released because of insufficient evidence and 
would be deported shortly afterwards reporters saw the thomaston 
native leave ilopango prison with us ambassador william walker 
you dont know whether to laugh because youre happy or cry 
because youre happy said susanna wallace of the christian 
education seminar in san antonio the lay church group that sent 
casolo to the central american country in 1985 
we hope this helps stop the persecution of church workers 
thats going on in el salvador wallace said weeping as she 
spoke this confirms our standing all along of her innocence 
in whethersfield casolos father john thanked volunteers and 
officials for bringing our daughter home 
in thomaston a western connecticut town of 7000 people the 
initial shock and disbelief over casolos arrest 2 weeks ago was 
replaced by an effort to win her freedom 
a hastily arranged prayer vigil drew 250 people and raised 
1000 teachers started a legal defense fund and other organized a 
letter and christmas cardwriting drive 
word of casolos release spread quickly at thomaston high 
school where casolo was student body president 10 years ago 
all the faculty here are extremely elated that shell be 
coming back home to us said teacher walter robinson word got 
around very very quickly from room to room to room 
a decade ago casolo was a cheerful popular high school senior 
more interested in cheering on the basketball team than changing 
the world 
casolo who came from a working classfamily finished at the 
top of her class and honors came easily to her in addition to 
being chosen student body president she was the yearbook editor 
and was voted most ambitious most creative and did the most for 
thomaston high school 
she was the hit of the school edward wilkinson now a vice 
principal at the school said tuesday she was very intelligent 
inquisitive a bundle of energy if anything needed to be started 
for school spirit or something she would always do it 
friends described her as a compassionate caring teenager but 
said there was little sign of the spirituality casolo would find 
working among el salvadors poor 
her parents divorced while she was a student her mother 
supported the family by working as a bookkeeper at a vocational 
high school in waterbury 
friends say casolo became more religious and more interested in 
social work while at brandeis university a prestigious liberal 
arts college in waltham mass 
she took a double major in american studies and latin american 
studies was captain of the soccer team and graduated summa cum 
laude 
friends say casolo experienced anxiety about choosing a career 
torn between an attraction to social work and a feeling of 
obligation to find a wellpaying job to help her mother 
social work won out after working with salvadoran refugees in 
seattle casolo who is fluent in spanish left for el salvador 
she worked for christian education seminars which organizes visits 
for prominent americans to el salvador 
i think that she was something she felt called to do rather 
than simply take a job and make a lot of money said susan 
abbott a close friend from high school 
the work put her in close contact with a wide range of 
salvadorans from president christiani and military leaders to 
church leaders and opposition party politicians 
casolo quickly formed a spiritual attachment to the country and 
its people particularly the poor 
in a letter to a friend she spoke of joining the catholic 
church to become a nun in another letter she wrote im a 
pastor without religion only with lots of love 
even after her arrest casolo remained upbeat shouting her 
claims of innocence to us reporters at her arraignment and 
describing her imprisonment as a lifechanging experience 
i cant say i have faith in the system to find me innocent 
she said but i believe my innocence will shine through

mark green whose complaint led to the 
congressional investigation of sen alfonse damato asked the 
senate ethics committee wednesday to widen its probe to include a 
hud grant and damato phone calls to a federal prosecutor 
green a democrat who lost the senate race to damato rny 
in 1986 also said potential witnesses in the investigation should 
be subpoenaed to testify under oath 
there are a lot of people with information who will be scared 
to speak out against damato given his reputation for 
ruthlessness unless the committee puts them under oath which in a 
sense protects them green said in an interview he also said 
damato should be put under oath 
damato said later he would testify before the committee in 
any way in which they request and im delighted to make myself 
available and to cooperate with them in every way and any way 
at a manhattan news conference on another issue damato said he 
was unaware of greens latest move but it wouldnt surprise 
whatever it is and im delighted that well have an opportunity to 
have all of mr greens charges reviewed by the ethics committee 
he said he was confident he would be exonerated 
green who currently runs the democracy project a liberal 
research organization in new york said he filed the additional 
papers because the committees special counsel henry schuelke iii 
asked him for any new information insights 
the phone calls green referred to were made by damato to 
thenus attorney rudolph giuliani in 1984 and 1985 on one 
occasion damato passed along a plea from the rev louis gigante 
for a reduction in the sentence of his brother mario gigante a 
convicted loan shark who also has been reported to be an officer in 
the genovese crime family 
damato has said he was merely trying to help the priest a 
constituent 
in the other call made at the behest of the late criminal 
lawyer roy cohn damato urged giuliani to review murder charges 
against an unnamed defendant giuliani has said he later concluded 
damato was referring to paul castellano then boss of the gambino 
crime family 
damato has said he was unaware of the identity of the defendant 
in the latter case and that he was trying to save giulianis office 
from being embarrassed if the charges didnt stick 
the hud grant was 500000 from a discretionary fund controlled 
by thensecretary samuel pierce the money was awarded to a 
coalition of black ministers including the rev al sharpton whose 
national youth movement was to use the money to rehabilitate a 
building into a drug treatment center the grant came one month 
after the group endorsed damato for reelection in 1986 
sharpton who is under indictment accused of stealing 250000 
from his organization has said if we hadnt endorsed damato i 
dont think bishop frederick d washington would have had access 
to damato and any funding 
damato spokeswoman zenia mucha has said that the senator did 
not know of sharptons role in the project after washington died 
last january the project was dropped 
green filed his original complaint against damato last july 
and followed up with an addendum in september he has charged that 
damato misused his influence to steer federal favors to political 
contributors and friends

companies that build planes spacecraft and 
related equipment have too few skilled workers as us schools lag 
behind in science and math an industry study concluded wednesday 
a survey of companies belonging to the aerospace industries 
association showed 67 percent of the companies suffer from a 
shortage of scientists and engineers and 55 percent report a 
shortage of production workers more than 80 percent said they 
expect more shortages in the future 
the problem is made more serious by rapid changes in the 
technology needed in aerospace industries by a lack of young 
people preparing for jobs with a technological focus by the 
failure of women and minorities to choose such careers and by the 
fact that us students generally are doing poorly in science and 
math said the aia study 
the survey was compiled from responses of 30 major corporations 
including nine of the top 10 defense department contractors and 
eight of the top 10 national aeronautics and space administration 
contractors 
key shortages are occurring in jobs that involve computers 
advanced materials electrooptics and artificial intelligence the 
study said 
among concerns raised by aerospace companies are that employees 
have insufficient handson experience that schools put too much 
emphasis on theoretical models that there is a lack of emphasis on 
design projects in college and that people with advanced degrees 
are academically oriented and have to adjust to the faster pace of 
industry 
some companies also complained of deficiences in verbal and 
teambuilding skills among highlevel professionals 
aerospace companies are responding to the problem by giving 
almost 40 percent of their total corporate contributions to 
education up to the high school level with large amounts going to 
colleges and universities for research and development projects 
the report said 
a november report by the american association of state colleges 
and universities concluded that the nation faces a crisis in 
science education with schools producing an inadequate number of 
science and engineering graduates

wednesday he will investigate a political campaign battle between 
government opponents and supporters this week that left one person 
dead and more than 20 injured 
we hope to determine the causes of this violence he told 
reporters

by both the leftist sandinista government and the opposition to 
monitor the process leading to national elections feb 25 it was 
his second trip here this year 
sandinistas and leaders of the national opposition union accused 
each other of inciting the dec 10 riot in masatepe 30 miles south 
of managua in which a sandinista campaign office and a private 
home were looted and two vehicles were burned 
it was the worst outbreak of violence in the 2monthold 
election campaign for president vice president a new legislature 
and municipal authorities nationwide 
the center for democracy a washingtonbased observer group 
blamed the sandinistas a report by the organization of american 
states said the riot was deliberately provoked but that its 
observers could not determine who was responsible 
carter said he is pleased that so far all sides are intent on 
having free and fair elections 
accompanying carter was his wife rosalynn former sen daniel 
evans rwash and former president daniel oduber of costa rica 
for the next three days they will travel throughout nicaragua 
talking to oas and united nations observer groups about the 
electoral process 
carter said he would like to see the money approved by the us 
congress for nicaraguas contra rebels channeled through a 
commission set up to oversee their demobilization 
he stopped short of calling for demobilization of the contras 
before the elections saying my hope is there will be no need 
for a contra presence after the elections 
carter was commenting on this weeks summit by five central 
american presidents that called for disbanding the contras and 
leftist salvadoran guerrillas 
the bush administration and contra leaders want the contras to 
remain in place as a fighting force until after the elections to 
make sure president daniel ortega keeps his promise the electoral 
process will be open and fair 
the five presidents agreed aug 7 in tela honduras to call for 
demobilization of the contras by dec 5 in exchange for ortegas 
promise of electoral fairness but contra leaders ignored the 
deadline and central american leaders passed it by after violence 
reescalated in el salvavador 10yearold civil war

the white house on wednesday denied any 
association between president bushs brother who has business 
dealings in china and us consideration of easing a satellite 
trade ban against beijing 
the president and prescott bush of connecticut who visited 
china last february on business are unaware of any association 
involving hughes aircraft the contractor that is building three 
satellites for launch by the chinese said white house spokesman 
steve hart 
bush is considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to china 
a sanction he imposed because of beijings violent crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last spring 
affected would be three communications satellites that are being 
manufactured by hughes and are to be launched in joint ventures by 
china 
administration officials have said the ban on satellite export 
might be lifted because bush meant to restrict military trade not 
commercial ventures 
the presidents brother is a business consultant to asset 
management international financing amp settlement of new york an 
international merchant bank that arranges financing and other 
services for firms doing multinational business 
stanley scheinman executive vice president of the firm said 
bushs decision on the satellite matter is not relevant to our 
business plans 
the presidents brother did not return a reporters wednesday 
calls to his new york office 
scheinman said it was pretty far out to suggest that a 
decision to resume the satellite transfers would benefit prescott 
bush or the asset management firm 
however he acknowledged that future telecommunications 
capacity established anywhere in the world to technology starved 
countries like the soviet union and china would benefit any 
telecommunications interest such as a client asset management is 
working with 
that company sino trade is involved in a venture with a 
chinese group to link data bases that are scattered all over china 
scheinman contended the firm already has its plans for a 
communications network using all existing telecommunications 
avenues including telephone lines microwave and an existing 
satellite thus said scheinman sino trade is not concerned about 
whether more satellites are brought in 
however the washington times on wednesday quoted an official of 
sino trade as saying that bushs decision on the hughes satellites 
could augment sino trades project although the company would not 
be dependent on it 
the official richard wall told the los angeles times that the 
hughes satellites would offer a better communications link than the 
domestic one in china 
hart said the presidents brother has been very careful in his 
dealings he is cognizant of his brothers position and has 
been in the past outspoken that there is no relationship in his 
business dealings with those of the government or the president 
prescott bush traveled through japan south korea and china in 
search of business for his own development consulting firm last 
february the president also visited those same countries later 
the presidents brother said at the time he saw no conflict of 
interest and stated he has a policy against doing business with the 
us government or lobbying the government

gunners mate kendall truitt told congress 
wednesday former uss iowa crew mate clayton hartwig was no 
suicidal freak and didnt cause the explosion that killed 
hartwig and 46 other sailors 
truitt accused the navy of using a big coverup to thwart 
theories that the shipboard explosion was accidental rather than 
caused intentionally most likely by hartwig as the navy has 
concluded 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on investigations also has been critical of 
the navys report and at the end of the hearing he told vice adm 
joseph s donnell iii youve pointed your finger when theres 
that little chance that the explosion was accidental 
wouldnt you have been better off to say we dont know the 
congressman asked 
donnell said the navy believes we do know that hartwig most 
likely caused the explosion 
truitt said hartwig wasnt told until the morning of april 19 
that he was going to be positioned at center gun in the no 2 gun 
turret so there would have been no time for planning a suicide 
explosion he said hartwig had once talked of suicide but truitt 
said he did not take him seriously 
truitt said his own theory is that the blast was caused by a 
defective hydraulic rammer the piece of equipment used to shove 
the powder bags up against the projectile in the huge gun 
he said he had had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in 
no 2 gun turret about a year earlier describing it as behaving 
like a transmission stuck between neutral and drive he theorized 
that the rammer might have suddenly taken off putting too much 
pressure on the propellant 
he also maintained that gunpowder on the iowa had been stored in 
high heat that the cans were not airtight and that you could 
smell ether when entering a powder storage area truitt said the 
fact that the crew mates working closest to the center gun had not 
gone through the exercise together before may have been a 
contributing factor in the explosion 
questioned about his personal relationship with hartwig truitt 
said they had a basically strong friendship with occasional 
quarrels under questioning he denied they had ever been 
homosexual lovers 
the navys official report on the iowa accident sept 7 made no 
mention of a possible homosexual link between the two although 
there had been earlier news reports that naval investigative agents 
were pursuing such a theory 
truitt said he thought other iowa crewmen spread rumors about 
the two because they didnt drink and spent a lot of time with each 
other i knew it wasnt true and it didnt bother me he said 
he knew it wasnt true it bothered him 
petty officer john mullahy who served on the iowa beginning 
last december and was in the same division as hartwig said of the 
two men from the time i was on board they werent talking to 
each other they hated each other 
yet hartwig never had truitt removed as the beneficiary on 
hartwigs 101000 life insurance policy truitt said that in 
settlement of the policy claim he gave hartwigs family 2500 
his lawyer 40000 and kept the rest 
truitt also revealed that he was named as beneficiary on a life 
insurance policy taken out by another sailor friend who is assigned 
to the uss roosevelt he said he saw nothing particularly unusual 
about such arrangements 
the gunners mate sat alone at the witness table in his navy 
uniform his wife of one year sat in the first row of the public 
seats 
he said there would have been no reason for hartwig to think he 
would be in the gun turret on the day of the fatal explosion last 
april 
he was off the watch list for the gunfiring exercise 
truitt said he was expecting his next assignment to be in 
london 
the gunners mate described the last seconds before shipboard 
blast off the coast of puerto rico 
truitt was part of the crew engaged in the firing exercise 
passing gun powder bags from a storage room to the center gun where 
the shooting was to take place he said the overheard last words of 
petty officer eric lawrence who was in center gun position with 
hartwig would have been far different if the explosion had been 
intentionally caused 
he wouldnt have had as his last words im not ready yet 
weve got a problem in here truitt said of lawrence he would 
have said hey excuse me guys he put a bomb in here if clay 
was going to blow up the ship lawrence would have stopped him 
they were literally standing shoulder to shoulder 
the navy has concluded that hartwig most likely caused the 
explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of 
gunpowder in the gun whose barrel has a 16inch diameter but it 
has acknowledged that the cause of the explosion likely will never 
be solved beyond a doubt because everyone near the gun was killed 
clayton michael hartwig did not cause the explosion said 
truitt i do not think he committed suicide i believe the report 
is very misleading 
its a big coverup in my opinion he said clayton 
hartwig was not the suicidal freak they make him out to be 
navy officers have said that while some safety lapses were 
discovered in the course of the investigation there was no 
substantial risk involving the 16inch guns and the powder used to 
fire them the captain of the iowa fred moosally testified 
earlier in the week he would not have allowed firing to resume six 
weeks after the accident if he had lingering safety concerns

worthy of but also practically capable of leading the country 
some of mladenovs remarks at the closing session of a threeday 
meeting were carried by bta the official news agency 
bta reported the expulsions from the party of zhivkov his son 
vladimir and milko balev a close associate of the former leader 
zhivkov 78 has come under increasing attack for alleged 
mismanagement and corruption as well as his dictatorial rule 
the news agency said the central committee would propose to 
parliament on thursday that it remove two constitutional clauses in 
which the party is given sole power 
one defines the party as the leading force in society and 
the state and the other says the party heads the construction of 
an advanced socialist society 
as the central committee meeting drew to a close a crowd 
estimated by western reporters at 60000 gathered in the plaza 
outside to show support in a rally sponsored by the party 
mladenov who served 18 years as foreign minister under zhivkov 
told the crowd our party does not need a law to guarantee its 
leading role it is the people who decide 
signs hoisted above the throng said a bulgarian communist 
party of untainted people and together with the bulgarian 
communist party for new democratic communist socialism 
nearby outside the alexander nevski orthodox cathedral about 
2000 people applauded a speaker from the agrarian union party who 
declared today we end this semiexistence 
the speaker not identified was referring to the subservient 
role given the agrarian union the only other legal party the 
communists allowed 
mladenov has moved swiftly to oust zhivkovs associates from the 
ruling party politburo in favor of people more likely to embrace 
reform 
in a speech to the central committee on monday mladenov said 
the party should start talks with independent groups immediately 
and relinquish the guarantee of sole power as has been done in 
poland hungary east germany and czechoslovakia he proposed that 
free elections be held by may 
zhivkov was removed from the central committee last week and his 
son was kicked out of the committee and all other party posts in 
november the former party leader has been accused publicly of 
living lavishly in a workers state in 13 opulent official 
residences and six hunting lodges 
officials have said the residences and lodges will be turned 
over to the public 
balev who was zhivkovs private secretary for many years was 
ousted from the politburo soon after the downfall of his boss 
andrei lukanov considered second in the new hierarchy after 
mladenov told the central committee on wednesday there are full 
grounds for detailed investigation of the income and expenses of 
zhivkov and his family bta reported 
lukanov heads a new party committee on corruption that is 
investigating financial and other violations by zhivkov his 
family and his closest circle cases of profiteering cases of 
corruption and the abuse of power for personal favors and other 
allegations bta said 
many speakers at the tuesday committee session criticized 
zhivkov and said anyone associated with him who remains in power 
should resign or be dismissed 
politburo member alexander lilov demanded zhivkov and close 
associates be punished and asked how the system could allow 
dictators to rule so long 
on sunday more than 50000 people demonstrated in sofia 
chanting calls for reform and dialogue between the communists and 
opposition it was the largest prodemocracy display since the 
communists consolidated power in 1946

gen manuel antonio noriega tightened 
his grip on power wednesday reshuffling his defense forces on the 
eve of a meeting by the legislature to discuss naming him chief of 
state 
a foe said this would mean the beginning of a fascist 
dictatorship 
a defense forces communique announced the promotion of 49 
officers four of them to the rank of lieutenant colonel 
automatically making them members of the general staff 
on thursday the 510member legislature dominated by noriega is 
to discuss a proposal by his supporters to name him chief of 
government with powers greater than those of provisional president 
francisco rodriguez 
the socalled popular power assembly was formed by rodriguez and 
is made up of representatives of mayors and county council 
chairmen it replaces the singlehouse national legislature vacated 
sept 1 
noriega annulled may 7 elections for a new president 
legislature and other offices when returns showed opposition 
candidates were winning by a landslide he later named rodriguez a 
longtime crony as provisional president 
noriega recently was named coordinator of the assembly 
as chief of government he would have total authority over the 
country since he will also be retaining his present job of defense 
forces chief 
rodriguezs job would be reduced to a ceremonial post 
this would be the beginning of a fascist dictatorship that 
gives civilian and military power to a single chief ricardo 
arias calderon head of the opposition christian demcoratic party 
said of noriegas latest move 
he can name himself emperor we know he is the one who 
rules and decides everything guillermo endara another 
opposition leader said 
endara and arias ran as presidential and vice presidential 
candidates in the may 7 elections annulled by noriega 
the general who survived two coup attempts in as many years 
was indicted in florida in february 1988 on us drugtrafficking 
and moneylaundering charges he denies the charges 
since then us economic sanctions against panama along with 
diplomatic pressure have failed to force him out of power

16 1988 and on oct 3 but failed to remove him more than 10 
people were killed in the last attempt 
among those promoted to lieutenant colonel were maj rafael

as we look at peacemaking in the middle east region we hope 
that the middle east does not slip on the international agenda and 
that certainly is a concern of many people in our part of the world

a prominent oil executive suggested wednesday 
the energy department drop consideration of a plan to cut the cost 
of building us emergency oil reserves by leasing rather than 
buying oil from foreign producers 
i have a little problem with going with hat in hand to opec 
or other foreign producers to in effect ask for help in filling 
the emergency reserve pete silas chairman of phillips petroleum 
co told a department hearing 
if its a good program it ought to be funded by us 
taxpayers he added 
silas said putting leased opec oil in the us strategic 
petroleum reserve would only add complications in the event of a 
serious us dispute with a leasor country 
it may end up in a confrontation where youd have to 
nationalize the leased oil silas said 
the phillips chairman was responding to questions from energy 
secretary james d watkins who told silas his department was 
considering a variety of ways of reducing the cost of filling the 
oil reserve which now hold 580 million barrels of oil in a series 
of underground salt domes in louisiana and texas 
watkins indicated his department in considering the oil reserve 
question as part of a broader national energy strategy had not yet 
decided whether the less costly leasing option would enhance or 
detract from us energy security 
the department had disclosed earlier this year that saudi 
arabia the no 1 foreign supplier of oil to the us market had 
expressed interest in leasing oil for the emergency reserve 
although no specific proposals had been discussed 
watkins told wednesdays hearing many nations of the world are 
approaching us rather aggressively about participating in a 
leasing program he did not name any of the countries 
donald e milsten director of the maryland energy office and 
vice chairman of the national association of state energy offices 
told watkins his association was concerned about the leasing idea 
but had not yet formed a firm opinion 
the strategic reserve might not be seen as a serious defense 
mechanism in an oil supply emergency if part of the stockpile was 
leased rather than owned by the us government milsten said

officials on wednesday announced the discovery 
of a mass grave with the remains of 135 children of north african 
jewish immigrants who died in a 1957 epidemic israel television 
reported 
the report came after a day of prayers and accusations by other 
jews from yemen on the saudi arabian peninsula they feared the 
grave could hold the bones of about 600 children from their 
community that were reported missing in the 1950s shortly after 
their arrival in israel 
the discovery of the mass grave reopened one of the most 
mysterious chapters in the history of immigration to the jewish 
state there has never been an authoritative explanation of the 
disappearance of the yemenite children 
one theory is that they were taken to collective farms and lost 
contact with their parents another is they were dispersed to other 
immigrant camps 
however news reports said the remains in the mass grave were 
instead those of north african children who died during the 
epidemic 
the unmarked mass grave was discovered last week in a cemetery 
in kfar yona a village 20 miles north of tel aviv when 
gravediggers tried to dig in an unused portion of the cemetery 
the find was leaked to the press by a gravedigger who said he 
feared the childrens remains might not be treated properly israel 
tv reported 
dozens of yemenite families flocked to the gravesite wednesday 
shortly after its discovery was announced on israel radio 
almost 47000 yemenites nearly the entire jewish community 
were brought to israel as part of operation magic carpet that 
program ended in 1950 
yisrael kessar a legislator from the leftofcenter labor party 
and a yemenite immigrant called on prime minister yitzhak shamir 
to order an investigation into the discovery after it was announced 
however police investigators said the remains were of children 
of north african immigrants who died in a nearby hospital and were 
hastily buried in a mass grave without a marker for economic 
reasons israel radio reported 
most of the north africans were from morocco tunisia libya and 
algeria there was no report of what sickness killed them but 
various epidemics swept through israeli camps in those years 
including cholera and tuberculosis 
the mass grave is next to the sites of two such camps 
nissim atiya a gravedigger who buried the victims in 1957 said 
the childrens families were notified of their deaths and it was 
all done officially

democratic house members continued their 
attack on president bushs decision to send highlevel officials to 
confer with chinese leaders complaining wednesday that the white 
house refused to allow one of those officials to come to capitol 
hill to defend the action 
it seems the bush administration is willing to send mr 
eagleburger 6000 miles to apologize to the chinese leaders but it 
was not willing to send him two miles to capitol hill to explain 
this action to congress said rep sam gejdenson dconn 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger had been invited 
to testify about the trip before a hearing convened by two house 
foreign affairs subcommittees eagleburger made the surprise visit 
to beijing last weekend with national security adviser brent 
scowcroft 
the state department said eagleburger could not testify because 
he was filling in for secretary of state james a baker iii who is 
in europe however spokesman richard boucher said eagleburger had 
briefed several members of congress on the mission 
democrats vowed to press early next year for punitive sanctions 
against the chinese government in retaliation for its violent 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing last june 
saying they could prevail even if bush vetoes the bill 
gejdenson was harshly critical of the eagleburgerscowcroft 
visit contending they apologized for being offended by the 
savage squelching of those who courageously sought basic freedoms 
in tiananmen square 
rep jim leach riowa defended bush 
i dont know of a soul who believes that the scowcroft mission 
went to beijing to apologize to the chinese he said this 
congress and this administration have no intention of kowtowing to 
illegitimate chinese actions 
however leach said he believes the united states has an 
obligation to take whatever steps it can to persude the chinese 
lift the yoke of political oppression the weekend mission he 
said can be seen as a test of the ability of outside parties to 
help extricate a proud nation from an embarassing corner 
president bush is prudentially betting that a historically 
xenophobic china is more likely to temper its stridency at home and 
abroad if it isnt perceived to be capitulating to the pressure of 
foreign powers leach said 
as house members wrangled over the issue senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine weighed in on behalf of those who contend 
bush made a serious blunder in sending scowcroft and eagleburger to 
beijing 
mitchell in a speech before the commonwealth club in san 
francisco said bush compounded his blunder when he moved to lift 
sanctions he had imposed against china by executive order 
those moves mitchell said include renewing subsidies for wheat 
sales to china permitting chinese engineers to return to the 
united states to work on upgrading chinese fighter planes and a 
possible lifting of a ban on exporting communications satellites 
these actions represent an embarrassing eagerness to please 
the chinese government and an awkward reluctance to support the 
aspirations of the chinese people mitchell said it should be 
the other way around

nine women who bared their breasts on a 
city beach last summer were not covered by the constitution a 
judge ruled wednesday 
rochester city court judge john manning regan refused to dismiss 
the charges saying the women violated a state law that prohibits 
public breast exposure he also found them guilty and fined them 
defense attorneys argued during a trial this fall that the law 
is a badge of inequality and a violation of the 14th amendment 
which guarantees equal protection under the law 
they asked regan to declare the law unconstitutional and he gave 
them time to present written arguments before making his ruling 
the prosecutor argued that the law is constitutional and 
conforms to community standards 
the women were arrested in june for removing their tops on a 
rochester beach charges were dropped against a 10th because she 
was nursing her child which is exempt from the state law exposure 
carries a maximum penalty of 15 days in jail and a 250 fine 
it was very disappointing to have his ruling against us i see 
it as a crushing blow against equal rights for women said 
defendant mary lou schloss 
seven women then known as the topfree seven were charged 
with indecent exposure in 1986 after they removed their shirts in 
rochesters cobbs hill park those charges were dismissed by a 
judge who called it an issue of free speech 
three women who were arrested in both cases were given 100 
fines wednesday schloss 41 kathleen reilly 43 and ramona 
santorelli 31 all of rochester 
six other defendants were either fined 50 or ordered to do 
community service gail nieser 25 sarah wells 41 susan david 
35 and nina leibowitz 21 all of rochester along with lyn gallo 
29 of ithaca and marilyn hiller 61 of brevard nc 
the women were also given criminal discharges meaning another 
arrest for a defendant within a year could reopen the charges 
against her 
regan dismissed charges against tierney obriendovan 31 who 
was nursing her child 
during sentencing some of the women said they would continue to 
go shirtless

china has approved a new voice of america 
correspondent to replace the newsman expelled after the government 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators the state department 
announced wednesday 
the foreign ministry conveyed its approval to the us embassy 
in beijing three days after a highlevel us delegation returned 
from a surprise trip to china 
the delegation discussed ways to mend the strained ties between 
the two governments that have existed since hundreds of people were 
killed in june when the chinese military advanced on the 
demonstrators in tianamen square 
we welcome the decision to approve stephanie mann nealers 
accreditation which has been pending since september the state 
department said in a statement nealer is head of the voas east 
asia and pacific news department 
voa correspondent al pessin and associated press newsman john 
pomfret were expelled from china after being accused of spreading 
rumors and lies about the military crackdown 
voa director richard w carlson said he didnt know whether the 
chinese decision on voa was related to the weekend talks in beijing 
led by national security adviser brent scowcroft 
we think this is a positive step carlson said 
the next move carlson said is for china to stop jamming the 
mandarin and cantonese language voa broadcasts to china as they 
have since june the fourhour englishlanguage broadcasts are not 
jammed he said 
the bush administration criticized by some members of congress 
for the recent overtures to beijing while chinese authorities 
continue to harshly suppress prodemocracy dissidents has made 
clear it would welcome any reciprocal gesture from china 
the first such gesture came when chinas official news agency 
announced monday the day scowcroft returned that china would not 
sell syria mediumrange m9 missiles that have been a subject of 
us concern 
after scowcroft returned the administration revealed it was 
considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to china bush 
refused wednesday to reply when asked if he was prepared to lift 
the ban but a spokesman said there had not been a final decision 
the hughes aircraftmanufactured communications satellites fall 
in the category of items on the governments sensitive munitions 
list that were automatically included in a suspension of us 
exports to china imposed to protest the crackdown 
on capitol hill a source said the satellite deal would be 
approved friday the source who has been following the 
administrations deliberations spoke on condition of anonymity 
senate majority leader george mitchell called word of the 
concessions to china an indication of an embarrassing eagerness 
to please the chinese government and an awkward reluctance to 
support the aspirations of the chinese people it should be the 
other way around 
mitchell noted that bush said after the june crackdown that 
there could not be business as usual with any government that would 
take such action 
yet that is exactly what appears to be happening mitchell 
said in a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco 
on the house side members of the asia subcommittee harshly 
criticized the trip to beijing and lambasted deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger for declining to appear before the panel 
to report on his talks in beijing 
meanwhile it was revealed that a third administration official 
white house personnel director chase untermeyer joined scowcroft 
and eagleburger on the china trip to make personal contacts for the 
president 
white house spokesman steve hart said untermeyers main mission 
was to speak to two chinese friends of bush one a midlevel 
government official and the other a former member of government 
untermeyer hart said was simply to hear their thoughts about 
the changes going on in china since the june demonstrations 
bush served as liaison officer then the highestranking us 
representative in beijing in 197475

usair is taking apart three of its older 
planes to search for agerelated structural flaws in an 
aroundtheclock effort to get a head start on an expected 
tightening of aircraft safety standards 
were trying to look in places you normally cant look at to 
see what we can do to prevent a problem in the future said usair 
spokesman john bronson 
a task force comprising representatives of the federal aviation 
administration airlines and aircraft manufacturers began studying 
the safety of older planes last year in the wake of several 
agerelated accidents it began its work in october 1988 six 
months after a section of the fuselage of an aloha airlines jet 
peeled off over the pacific ocean 
jack naughton director of aircraft heavy maintenance for usair 
said wednesday that faa inspection recommendations are likely to 
become mandatory in february naughton called the aloha airlines 
accident which killed a flight attendant and injured dozens of 
passengers the catalyst for the closer look at older planes 
usair selected three dc9s each about 20 years old for the 
program the airline has completed what it calls an inchbyinch 
inspection of one dc9 and returned it to the usair 400plane fleet 
the second plane in the program is at an airline maintenance 
hangar at pittsburghs airport mechanics are to have it finished 
within a month 
the 22yearold dc9 built for delta airlines in 1967 and 
bought by usair a decade later has been stripped of its paint and 
cabin furnishings three shifts of 18 mechanics each work day and 
night searching for flaws not readily revealed by more common 
inspection techniques 
the thick smell of primer floats inside the hangar and there is 
a constant whir of machinery and ping of hammers on rivets 
mostly the mechanics are looking for evidence of corrosion 
which airline officials believe leads to fuselage cracks 
standing over a table beside the 107footlong plane mechanic 
harry garman worked wednesday to replace corroded metal from 
underneath the aircraft 
well either treat it or well replace it depending on the 
depth of it garman said 
its kind of like your rusty fender on a car he explained 
if its just a little bit of rust you clean it up and paint it 
but if its real deep you replace that area 
working on a scaffold alongside the plane charlie slack placed 
a metal reinforcing strip above the planes windows from front to 
rear tests have shown that area to be more susceptible to stress 
cracks than other parts of the plane 
usair estimates the procedure will cost about 1 million per 
plane after the first three dc9s are completed airline officials 
will review the program and make any necessary adjustments before 
continuing 
george mason the airlines vice president of heavy maintenance 
said 29 planes are scheduled to be completed in the next four 
years a total of 50 of usairs 74 dc9s will be stripped and 
inspected he said 
mason said hes not worried that patching up the aircraft might 
make usairs fleet look less skyworthy 
it all in your perspective he said when you see an 
airplane at the gate that has patches on it should you be 
concerned or should you be concerned if you see an airplane that 
doesnt have them

the story of the 54th the first black regiment from the north 
to fight in the civil war and its youthful white colonel robert 
gould shaw unfolds in glory edward zwicks masterful movie 
for tristar pictures 
zwick presents a powerful moving tapestry of wars 
senselessness the screenplay by kevin jarre is partly based on the 
books lay this laurel and one gallant rush and letters 
shaw wrote home to his parents the movie narrated by matthew 
broderick as shaw is largely seen through his eyes 
young and privileged but disillusioned and battlescarred after 
the gory and indecisive battle of antietam shaw returns to his 
wealthy powerful and abolitionist parents in massachusetts just in 
time for a lavish party and an offer from the governor to take 
command of an allblack fighting regiment 
he rises in rank from captain to colonel and musters his men 
who include his childhood friends cabot cary elwes who is white 
and becomes a major and tom andre braugher a secondgeneration 
free black who volunteers as an enlisted man 
much of glory focuses on the basic training of a ragtag 
group of runaway slaves and free men who are denied all the basic 
supplies given to white soldiers including proper shoes and the 
coveted blue uniform and are asked to accept less pay 
they have much to learn about soldiering and about human 
relations in a fight for freedom and the restoration of the union 
as trip an embittered runaway denzel washington cry 
freedom the mighty quinn power does a star turn his 
hatred desires feelings are worn on his face such as when hes 
flogged for supposedly trying to desert not one word is uttered 
he merely locks eyes with broderick biloxi blues war 
games and allows a single tear to fall broderick meanwhile 
shows clear repulsion and sorrow why because the whip a symbol 
of the servitude from which the men had fled had been used on 
trip in the past his back is a jungle of ugly scars 
glory becomes trips story as well as shaws as the 
runaway undergoes a radical selfrealization in the end the 54th 
becomes the only family hes ever known 
zwick the emmyaward winning director of special bulletin 
and thirtysomething stresses visual acting in glory 
action speaks louder than words and he focuses on facial 
expressions and body movements rather than histrionics gimmicks or 
slick words 
he also is spare with dialogue when the 54th marches past the 
white regiments who regarded the blacks as a joke and less than 
men to lead the assault against fort wagner only four words are 
spoken by the once hostile whites give em hell 54 
ultimately color no longer is the issue the men are fellow 
soldiers about to die and like gallipoli and hamburger 
hill the overriding issue becomes the utter futility of war 
the battle scene at fort wagner is beautifully choreographed 
the men running along the beach the us flag full and billowing 
it is poetic and yet powerful 
glory makes good use of battle scenes they are exciting 
frightening and realistic at james island the 54th gets its first 
taste of fighting after firing a few rounds and watching a 
confederate unit retreat more confederates appear through the mist 
like gray ghosts and the battle soon becomes handtohand combat 
dan lerner was second unit director and bob minor coordinated the 
stunts 
glory is bound to be a contender at oscar time it also has 
a haunting but overused score by james horner with choral work by 
the boys choir of harlem the music is lovely but unfortunately the 
filmmakers use the same refrain so often that just about every 
scene becomes a climax 
there are good performances by morgan freeman street smart 
driving miss daisy jihmi kennedy as a stuttering enlisted man 
and john finn as the fierce nononsense irish sergeantmajor who 
whips the 54th into shape braugher whose theater credits include 
much ado about nothing and king john at the new york 
shakespeare festival makes his film debut in glory and is 
someone to watch jane alexander appears as shaws mother

a french mercenary widely 
blamed for killing the leader of the comoros islands said the 
president was accidentally shot by his own bodyguard during an army 
attack a newspaper reported wednesday 
meanwhile a french news agency said french and south african 
officials met with the mercenary bob denard on wednesday in an 
attempt to persuade him to leave the remote islands off southeast 
africa 
denard who heads the mercenaryled presidential guard on the 
islands said president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane was fatally 
shot on nov 26 during an assault by army troops the star 
newspaper reported from the comoros capital of moroni 
the report did not say why the army was attacking the nations 
leader 
denard in a statement read to journalists tuesday night said 
he was in the room with abdallah at the presidential palace when 
the shooting occurred but he again denied any responsibility for 
the killing the star reported 
the mercenary a veteran soldier of fortune who has fought in 
africa and asia declined to answer questions or elaborate on the 
circumstances of abdallahs death other than to say a bodyguard 
actually shot the president 
denard and 30 other french and belgian mercenaries use the 
presidential guard to control the islands despite widespread 
opposition by residents who have taken to the streets in protest 
the mercenary said he was prepared to leave the islands if he is 
allowed to go with honor he is negotiating with the french and 
south africans the largest aid donors to the comoros and wants 
financial compensation in exchange for leaving 
the french news agency agence francepresse in a report from 
moroni quoted unidentified sources as saying french and south 
african officials met with denard for 20 minutes wednesday morning 
there was no information on what was discussed but the agency 
said a sticking point is denards demand for a guarantee he will 
not be prosecuted in france for his role in an unsuccessful 1977 
coup in the west african country of benin 
comorans widely blame denard for abdallahs death according to 
various sources the two men argued about several matters just 
before the shooting 
denard helped engineer a coup that ousted abdallah in 1975 the 
year the island nation became independent from france 
denard then led a 1978 coup that restored abdallah to power he 
and his fellow mercenaries have remained a leading force on the 
islands ever since 
in paris president francois mitterrand said at wednesdays 
weekly cabinet meeting that any idea of french military 
intervention is excluded in the comoros government spokesman 
louis le pensec told reporters

chileans elect a new government thursday 
returning to a democratic tradition that was a model for latin 
america until gen augusto pinochet seized power in 1973 the 
opposition is expected to win 
of 75 million registered voters 35 million have never voted 
in a real election voting is mandatory and failure to vote can 
bring a 95 fine 
most preelection polls gave patricio aylwin who represents an 
alliance of 17 centrist and leftist parties a lead of more than 20 
percentage points over progovernment candidate hernan buchi 
a third candidate 47yearold conservative entrepreneur 
francisco errazuriz is expected to finish far back 
the opposition alliance led the effort that defeated pinochet in 
an october 1988 referendum by rejecting a proposal that he continue 
as president until 1997 that forced him to call elections 
although he will be out as president pinochet says he will 
remain as army commander for eight more years sheltered by a 
constitutional provision that prohibits the new president from 
dismissing him the opposition has urged him to retire but 
acknowledges it is the generals decision 
a violent coup led by pinochet in september 1973 overthrew the 
3yearold elected government of the late president salvador 
allende an avowed marxist during a period of political and 
economic disorder 
interior minister carlos caceres told foreign reporters the 
election was the culmination of a orderly staged process that 
started the day of the coup he said the military government had 
kept its word to restore democracy once it established order 
rightened the economy and created a new legal framework for 
government 
upon taking power pinochet had promised to rule only as long 
as circumstances demand 
in preparation for the thursdays vote municipal workers 
stripped campaign posters from walls and telephone poles and 
painted out political graffiti that blossomed in a generally 
peaceful campaign campaigning ended monday night by law 
soldiers and police guarded polling places along with strategic 
sites in the cities and countryside 
pinochet made no public statements but gen jorge lucar the 
deputy army commander asked chileans to go and vote peacefully 
knowing they can count on all guarantees necessary to cast their 
ballots freely and secretly 
aylwins campaign manager enrique silva cimma met wednesday 
with gen carlos parera commander of the santiago garrison and 
said parera gave assurances the armed forces would guarantee a 
clean vote 
another coalition official enrique krauss asked the government 
to report voting results in strict accordance with the law 
in the 1988 referendum widespread allegations arose that 
negative results were held back for hours before the government 
admitted pinochet had lost 
caceres said initial results would be reported after the first 
350000 votes about 5 percent of the total were counted thursday 
night and updated reports would follow every 90 minutes or so 
caceres said final results for the 38 senate seats and the 120 
in the house of deputies would be known about noon friday 
cardinal juan francisco fresno of santiago said wednesday i 
believe we can now say in all truth that spirits have calmed and we 
can be confident of a new dawn in peace and fraternal friendship 
the church was one of pinochets few outspoken critics during 
years of antileftist repression that followed the coup it 
condemned violations of human rights including the disappearances 
of hundreds of dissidents and the torture and expulsion of 
thousands more 
aylwin 71 is a moderate christian democrat active in politics 
for four decades and known for a lowkey conciliatory style he 
has stressed the need to avoid confrontation and seek national 
reconciliation 
buchi 40 is an internationally respected technocrat who joined 
pinochets economic team in 1975 and was finance minister from 1985 
until may a period of steady economic growth and low inflation 
his advisers hope to keep aylwins vote total below a majority in 
the threeway race and force a runoff

town officials fearing that beaver dams 
would flood recently repaired linseed road decided to rub out the 
rodents but found themselves having to take on schoolchildren and 
the beavers club 
pupils at breor elementary school in this small town about 20 
miles north of springfield fired off a batch of letters last week 
accusing selectmen of being cruel and asking please dont kill 
the beavers 
about six beavers live in a marshy field next to the road 
according to micki seigel who lives in the area and has printed up 
bumper stickers saying i love the linseed road beavers 
this week a pupils letter reached the beavers club of hampden 
and hampshire counties a holyokebased service group asking them 
to help their namesakes 
selectman chairman george zgrodnick jr said wednesday he 
remains convinced that trapping is the best solution to protect the 
350000 worth of repairs on the road 
i dont know much about beaver dams but i know theyre bad 
zgrodnick said 
he defended his decision not to call in an engineer before 
authorizing the trapping but said an engineer would be called in 
this weekend to assess the potential for damage 
zgrodnick said selectmen told people opposing trapping that if 
they could find another way to deal with the problem very very 
quickly go ahead 
beaver club president charles davignon said his group was not 
interested in joining the political fray but was willing to 
consider a request for help if a compromise is agreed on such as 
installing special drainage pipes 
club members visited seigel this week at running gutter brook a 
small beaver lodge and dam have turned the field by the road into a 
shallow pond now covered with ice 
seigel said her main objective was to buy time until the field 
froze over 
i am not an animal rights activist she said it just 
seemed why kill them if you dont have to 
the beavers appeared this summer and the issue of the road 
threat surfaced this fall said zgrodnik who said he did not 
recall who first brought it up 
some in town said they werent sure how the issue got so 
controversial 
we were kind of caught surprised ourselves when we started 
reading in the newspapers and we started checking into it said 
water commissioner robert osepowicz 
even if beaver dams block storm drains water will drain through 
slits cut into the curb highway superintendent marshall pease was 
quoted as saying in a local newspaper last week 
pease had no comment wednesday all the answers come from town 
hall he said 
tom decker a biologist with the state division of fisheries and 
wildlife said about 1400 beavers are killed in massachusetts each 
year during the season between nov 15 and feb 28 
we get hundreds of nuisance complaints decker said

in a decision solomon might admire a judge 
wednesday authorized mrs santa claus to share equal giftgiving 
christmas rights with her famous husband and declared their sleigh 
community property 
furthermore mrs claus title is now ms and she is 
emancipated from any household duties so that she may accompany 
her jolly spouse on his airborne tours of the world according to 
the ruling by municipal court judge george t choppelas 
christmas generosity symbolized by santa claus is a universal 
phenomenon and should have no gender strings attached the judge 
added undoubtedly with an eye to his political future 
a courtroom jammed with spectators reporters and photographers 
broke into cheers and applause at the conclusion of a rather unruly 
and holidayhappy 60th session of san franciscos mock court of 
historical review 
the justforfun court is a 14year san francisco tradition 
staged in a real city hall courtroom with a real judge real 
lawyers clerks and stenographers only the witnesses are phony 
everybody has a good time with such questions as who invented 
the martini is chicken soup jewish penicillin and where did chop 
suey come from 
thank you for not starting without me said the judge to the 
trial advocates san francisco supervisor angela alioto who said 
santa was a woman and public defender jeff brown who said he must 
remain a male brown who will run for reelection let his 
witnesses carry the case 
the stage was set by a reading of clement moores a visit from 
st nicholas by a local talk show personality 
looking on with interest were municipal court judge diane wick 
dressed as a female santa and lawyer robert j mccarthy 
pillowpaunched with a tatty white beard and wig he sat on the 
lady santas lap 
its obvious that santa claus is a woman claimed alioto 
insisting that the italian female santa claus befana leaps 
down chimneys to dole out toys to good kids and chunks of coal to 
the bad ones 
the lady santa testified hotly that the idea of a male santa 
claus is a fraud and a hoax furthered by the male chauvinist 
persuasion 
completing her testimony santa laid several brightly wrapped 
gifts before the judge 
bribery hollered the male santa 
tradition requires that santa claus remain a man testified san 
francisco city college history professor lee dolson who wondered 
whether alioto was arguing that the italian santa might have 
resulted from a sex change operation 
i think that santa claus is the personification of christmas 
and santa claus as a man he embodies the spirit of christmas 
which is giving caring and hope testified psychiatric hospital 
adminstrator franco diamond the thought of santa claus as a 
woman i shudder 
nobody in the courtrroom shared the shudder and the judge ruled 
that everybody wins

leadership of east germany reached its peak 
manfred gerlach interim president of east germany told church 
leaders a new constitution expected next year would provide for 
individual states within a federal system another sign of the 
communists continuing loss of power

formed a reference to adolf hitlers third reich 
other newspapers took a similar line against reunificiation

neue zeit said demonstrators in leipzig who called for 
reunification were expressing outdated megalomaniac dreams of 
greater germany

state officials vowed they would fare better 
on their next visit to a potential radioactive waste dump site 
after they were chased and cornered for five hours wednesday by 
antidump protesters 
more than 100 dump opponents scored a moral if not 
psychological victory when they demanded police arrest them or 
the members of a scouting team from the state lowlevel radioactive 
waste siting commission for trespassing 
the commissions field teams were on a walking tour of the 
proposed site in the town of allen when they were spotted around 
noon by more than 100 dump opponents according to protest 
organizer stuart campbell 
the protesters tracked footprints left by the seven state 
officials as they ran up and down hills in the wooded area before 
catching them on a county road and surrounding them with a human 
chain said allegany county sheriff lawrence scholes 
the officials were released some five hours later after the 
owner of the land they were surveying filed a trespassing complaint 
against them 
meanwhile 100 miles to the east 20 protesters were arrested in 
cortland county for disorderly conduct after they refused to allow 
a state inspection team to leave one of two potential sites there 
according to a sheriffs department dispatcher 
in allen scholes said the protesters ignored warnings to stay 
away from the proposed site and camped out there overnight 
the dump opponents said the state officials were on private 
property and the owner was never told the team would be there to 
inspect his land 
either you arrest them or you arrest us sally campbell of 
the allegany county nonviolent action group told the officers 
william giovanniello the owner of the property said state 
officials did not have his permission to be on his land they 
never notified me no phone call no nothing he said 
siting commission staff member bruce goodale called 
giovanniellos claim sheer nonsense 
after giovanniello filed a written complaint against the state 
the dump opponents allowed the officials to leave 
as they did the group howled and yelled see you in the 
morning protesters vowed they would again block commission 
members from inspecting the other two possible dump sites in the 
county 
goodale promised his group would return 
they may feel it is a moral or psychological victory said 
jay dunkleberger executive director of the commission who visited 
the cortland county site wednesday i consider it a draw we did 
accomplish the task we set for ourselves for the day 
commission officials in the cortland county town of taylor had 
to be escorted two miles after protesters there formed a human 
chain and pinned them in their cars 
the antidump group sent cars trucks and tractors to the site 
wednesday morning after members who have been watching the two 
taylor sites around the clock reported the state field crews 
arrival said taffy rook a spokeswoman for citizens against 
radioactive dumping 
at one point three state officials and several deputies were 
trapped in the woods by protesters who had blocked all roads 
leading to the site rook said 
mary gardner smith a spokeswoman for concerned citizens of 
allegany county said about 20 protesters camped out overnight in 
freezing temperatures at two of the three allegany sites to block 
state officials from beginning inspections on land there they were 
joined by other protesters at daybreak she said 
siting commission officials said they hoped to start testing 
possible sites after the deer hunting season ended tuesday 
i hope that people dont go outside the law said susan 
baranski a spokeswoman for the commission the courts have made 
it clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do 
this 
antidump groups in allegany and cortland counties have promised 
to prevent the testing from taking place the groups said their 
protests would be nonviolent but said they expected arrests 
the five possible sites were chosen by the commission in 
september under federal law states must have a place to store 
lowlevel radioactive waste by 1993 
the commission plans to complete soil testing and other 
evaluations by spring the commission will then narrow down the 
number of sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests

the nations first comprehensive program to teach 
kindergartners and high schoolers alike about the dangers of guns 
was launched wednesday by dade countys public schools 
the special curriculum was developed following a record 43 
gunshot deaths last year in dade county of children 18 and under 
so far this year at least 48 children have been killed in 
gunrelated incidents in dade school officials said 
the program was made necessary by an increase in the prevalence 
of guns in society said michael krop a member of the dade county 
school board 
we now feel compelled unfortunately to teach kids about 
guns krop said earlier at a news conference at coconut grove 
elementary essentially our message to young people is you 
dont touch a handgun 
that message will be reinforced in the classroom with 
discussions aimed at helping students recognize unsafe situations 
and know how to react when encountering guns 
a video also will be shown to middle and senior high students 
focusing on the trauma of a gunshot death or injury through the 
experiences of other kids one teenager describes the trauma of 
accidentally shooting his father also interviewed were a football 
player left paralyzed and a girl who lost a leg in gun attacks 
brochures and a video were being prepared for parents to help 
them insure the safety of their children 
wednesday was declared gun safety awareness day by dade 
county public schools the nations fourthlargest school district 
todays youngsters are at a greater risk of gun violence than 
any previous generation barbara lautman executive director of 
the center to prevent handgun violence in washignton dc said 
friday at the news conference we want the dade county program to 
serve as the national standard for education to reduce gun 
violence death and injury among youth 
in 1987 one out of every 10 children who died in the nation was 
killed with a gun and gun accidents were the fourth leading cause 
of accidental death for children according to ms lautman 
a new state law aimed at protecting children from accidental 
shootings also authorized the development of a gunsafety program 
in public schools the measure which took effect in october 
requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to keep loaded 
weapons away from children 15 and younger the law provides for 
jail time and fines for gun owners carelessness 
dades program to prevent gun injuries and deaths among children 
is tailored by age groups for example at the elementary level the 
emphasis will be on roleplaying while in the sixth through 12th 
grades students will focus on issues surrounding gun violence 
including conflict resolution activities and the role of the media 
the curriculum was developed following discussions in april led 
by volunteers from the dade county youth crime watch with some 400 
middle and senior high students about guns and gun violence 
among the findings released wednesday were that students have 
mixed opinions on whether guns are good or bad with black and 
hispanics most aware of and involved with daily handgun violence 
students believe guns are more common today than at previous times 
and that antigun messages need to show more the pain and loss 
suffered by victims of gun violence 
dwayne dupuch a second grader at coconut grove elementary said 
he had never been around a gun but he knew what they could do 
kill he said without hesitation and what had he learned so 
far about them 
not to touch guns said the shy 7yearold

soldiers marched onto a computerized 
fort benning range wednesday to demonstrate four of the worlds 
most advanced military rifles technology the army hopes will 
double the combat effectiveness of us troops in the 21st century 
firing single shots and bursts the helmeted shooters scored 
hits on stationary and moving targets up to 300 meters away while 
loudspeakers rattled with the sounds of returning enemy fire to 
heighten their stress levels 
the army will begin seven months of tests next month to see if 
new weapons technology can help soldiers score twice as many hits 
on the battlefield despite fear and fastmoving targets 
four companies have supplied prototypes for the armys advanced 
combat rifle test all the rifles fire in the semiautomatic and 
fully automatic modes and three can fire threeshot bursts 
designed to overcome aiming errors 
the colt industries version is derived from the m16 but has a 
redesigned handguard pistol grip and an adjustable buttstock for 
improved handling it fires standard m16 ammunition or a duplex 
cartridge with two rounds 
colt says one bullet travels straight to the target the other 
diverges slightly to improve the hit probability 
a rifle submitted by the aai corp of hunt valley md uses a 
standard brass cartridge but the projectile is a steel dart known 
as a flechette 
flechettes are lighter than bullets move faster and have a 
flatter trajectory that makes them accurate to 600 meters said 
vernon e shisler the arc project manager from picatinny arsenal 
nj 
a rifle submitted by steyrmannlicher of steyr austria fires a 
steel flechette from a cartridge with a plastic case the 
futuristiclooking steyr design is shorter than conventional 
military rifles because its operating mechanism is in the buttstock 
the heckler amp koch prototype resembling an elongated home video 
camera also has the mechanism in the buttstock the west german 
rifle fires a small bullet from a rectangular caseless 
cartridge made from molded propellant the cartridge is about 1 
inch long and threeeighths of an inch square the hampk and steyr 
ammunition are extremely light 
besides the prototypes soldiers will fire m16 rifles to 
provide control data during the test 
shisler said the new rifles are among the worlds most advanced 
military weapons and the first to include features such as multiple 
projectiles and burst firing that help overcome human factors 
weve always wanted a weapon to be reliable to be accurate to 
perform under all kinds of environments and conditions he said 
these guns are more fireable they fit the soldier better 
what were trying to do is help compensate for problems the shooter 
has because hes scared because hes in combat 
the army has spent about 40 million since 1982 on research and 
development and expects to spend another 17 million by 1991 when 
officials decide which technology if any to pursue 
if one of the designs is accepted soldiers could have the m16 
replacement as early as 1996 officials said at a briefing 
wednesday 
starting jan 16 the rifles will be tested by teams of 18 army 
and air force shooters on a computerized 27 million range 
theyll fire at moving and stationary targets from 25 to 600 meters 
from prone standing and foxhole positions 
another 18member team will arrive in april ten female shooters 
will test the weapons in august and september 
each target has curved rods that sense the projectiles 
shockwaves as they travel within 15 feet of the target so the 
computer not only plots the shooters hits and displays them on 
video monitors but also their misses 
army officials said its impossible to duplicate combat 
conditions but shooters will feel added stress because of 
interservice rivalry and peer pressure theyll exercise before 
firing and wear heart monitors during the tests 
army tests indicate an m16 rifle fired under ideal conditions 
can hit 300 meter targets whenever the trigger is pulled the hit 
probability at the same distance drops to about 65 percent during 
marksmanship training 
the m16 was a fine weapon its reliable and accurate it 
ranks among the best shisler said in combat soldiers are 
frightened and dont have time to aim our goal is to increase 
their effectiveness

hungarian prime minister miklos nemeth said 
wednesday that his country was the first east bloc nation to 
probe the limits of soviet tolerance and that one major goal 
now is to avoid an explosion 
nemeths comment came as he cut a scheduled threeday british 
visit to 12 hours because of the pace of events at home 
he cautioned that a proposed austerity budget will provoke 
opposition but said tough measures are hungarys only hope of 
developing a marketoriented economy 
this program is not being applauded by the people tensions 
will emerge he said speaking through an interpreter at a news 
conference 
what everybody needs to comprehend now is that the future of 
the country is at stake stability and avoiding an explosion this 
is one of the main lines of hungarian policy 
nemeth reacted coolly to a suggestion that hungary is being 
cautious about distancing itself politically from the soviet union 
hungary was the first to probe the limits of soviet 
tolerance nemeth said referring to the dissolution of the 
communist party before the rapid changes in east germany bulgaria 
and czechoslovakia and dont forget in hungary this was not 
done in the streets 
the hungarian communist party disbanded itself in october and 
formed the the hungarian socialist party which espouses democratic 
principles in hungarys first democratic elections for 41 years 
due next year the party will compete with others for power 
nemeth 41 a reformist member of hungarys former communist 
party came to britain as 24 industrialized nations coordinating a 
big aid program to poland and hungary met in brussels belgium 
his visit was part of an aggressive campaign for western aid he 
also wants access to western high technology denied to communist 
countries during the cold war 
western countries have pushed for austerity as a condition for 
aid 
we are not able to do it on our own nemeth said hungary 
is not looking simply for smiles and pats on the back we need 
financial assistance 
during his visit nemeth conferred with prime minister margaret 
thatcher and said she promised managerial assistance britian has 
set up two 40 million knowhow funds one for poland and one 
for hungary 
but to unlock aid promised by the international monetary fund 
and the 24 donor nations hungary must adopt the austerity 
measures a hungarian decision is expected next week

the government wednesday appealed to 
parliament for fast approval of its plans for economic reform but 
said it doesnt need special powers to bypass lawmakers as proposed 
by solidarity leader lech walesa 
deputy finance minister marek dabrowski told a news conference 
that if the austerity measures tight budget and antiinflationary 
plans succeed polands 900 percent annual inflation rate will 
disappear by mid1990 
walesa caused a sensation tuesday when he said parliament should 
simply grant the government wide powers to put into effect whatever 
economic measures it deems necessary to combat the nations 39 
billion foreign debt widespread shortages of goods and industrial 
production problems 
time is running out walesa said when he made the proposal 
parliamentary debate on all the laws could delay the program he 
said 
however government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said at 
the news conference with dabrowski that the government was 
surprised by walesas proposal she said it will not seek special 
powers because it would rather have parliament approve the 
legislation although in a speededup way 
the success of the whole difficult project depends to a great 
extent on social support thus the opinion of societys 
representation of parliament is of great significance to us 
said the spokeswoman 
however when pressed she said she could not exclude the 
government accepting special powers if parliament decides to give 
them 
the economic plan of the solidarityled government has been 
praised by the international monetary fund and poland and the imf 
will complete in the nearest days a letter of intent outlining 
the program the official said 
the imf would grant about 700 million in loans to poland in 
exchange for the reforms 
the agreement would also open the door to a broader flow of 
credit and financial aid with promised help from western countries 
already exceeding 32 billion dabrowski said 
if the governments plans succeed the pace of price rises 
currently more than 50 percent a month should fall to an average 
25 percent a month in the first quarter of 1990 said dabrowski 
they should fall 2 to 3 percent more each month for the rest of 
that year he said 
inflation will be cut through reduced government spending and 
tax increases to balance the budget limits on wage increases 
through tax penalties an end to government subsidies to force 
inefficient enterprises to close and making the polish zloty fully 
convertible against hard currencies in poland 
the effect will be dramatic the deputy minister said it 
may cut real incomes by 20 percent industrial production by 5 
percent and the gross national product by 2 to 3 percent he said 
prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis government has been working 
around the clock this week to prepare by sunday more than a dozen 
pieces of legislation to radically transform the economy beginning 
jan 1

the district attorney acknowledged wednesday 
that he is investigating charges that the rev bruce ritter 
founder of the covenant house for homeless youth improperly spent 
the shelters funds 
after nearly two days of silence amid news reports that ritter 
provided an apartment money and gifts to a young male prostitute 
and took him on trips manhattan district attorney robert 
morgenthau issued a statement saying the probe was in its 
earliest stages 
no determination has been made as to the truth of the 
allegations nor can such a determination be made until the 
investigation has been concluded morgenthau said 
but he said press reports of leaks attributed to unnamed law 
enforcement officials are inaccurate may unfairly damage 
reputations and can only impede the investigation 
spokesmen for covenant house denied the young mans allegations 
we categorically deny any kind of illicit relationship between 
father ritter and this youth said james harnett the shelters 
chief executive officer 
the new york post reported wednesday that investigators had the 
youth wear a recording device during a conversation with ritter in 
an effort to confirm the illicit sex allegations 
a law enforcement source told the associated press the youths 
name was timothy warner 20 
it is not clear whether warner managed to record anything but 
harnett said ritter suspected at the time that he was possibly 
being set up he added that he was not concerned about anything 
ritter may have said 
i think it was outrageous and disgusting for the district 
attorney to outfit this kid with a wire to try to entrap father 
ritter harnett said i can tell you father ritter is a lot 
calmer about this than i am 
the law enforcement source who spoke to the associated press on 
condition of anonymity said the probe began after warner took his 
allegations and documentation to the district attorneys office 
the source said the young man worked in covenant houses 
computer operation and was able to obtain printouts about 
expenditures that he gave investigators 
investigators are looking into the matter as possible financial 
misconduct the source said 
morgenthau said covenant house staffers are cooperating fully 
with the investigation and no subpoenas have been necessary 
ritter 62 a franciscan priest brought warner to new york from 
new orleans in february after the young man told the priest he 
wanted to escape prostitution ritter called the allegations 
scurrilous lies and said the young man had emotional problems 
the post meanwhile reported that a female employee at covenant 
house had said ritter might have been involved with a second youth 
officials of the district attorneys office refused to comment 
ritter has hired a criminal defense attorney stanley arkin 
there is no case and there never was any case against 
ritter arkin said 
john cardinal oconnor who had been silent on the case issued 
a statement in support of ritter in all my personal association 
with father ritter and those who work with him i have seen nothing 
but selfsacrifice and commitment to the most abandoned in society 
as archbishop of new york i have held father ritters work in 
high esteem oconnor said 
ritters covenant house opened in 1969 after six teens showed up 
at his apartment looking for a place to stay according to 
spokesmen for the shelter since then the organization has grown 
into an 85 millionayear operation with seven shelters in the 
united states one in toronto and four in latin america 
the organization gets more than 90 percent of its funds from 
private donations

a texas appeals court set aside the 
conviction of death row inmate clarence lee brandley on wednesday 
more than two years after a judge ruled the black man was unfairly 
tried in the slaying of a white teenager 
this will make this christmas as bright as can be it was 
worth the wait brandley said from the visiting area of death 
row where he spent nearly nine years and once came within six days 
of execution before getting a stay 
its been a long time brandley 38 said after he was told 
the courts decision im very thankful i didnt know what it 
was going to when it was going to be its a prayer thats been 
answered its going to take some time to sink in to soak in 
in a 63 decision the appellate court said brandley did not get 
a fair trial when a jury convicted him of the 1980 strangulation 
and rape of a teenager at conroe high school where brandley was a 
janitor 
his first trial ended with a hung jury an allwhite jury found 
him guilty in a second trial brandleys attorneys and supporters 
contended the conviction was racially motivated 
then on oct 9 1987 after a 10day evidentiary hearing moved 
from conroe to galveston retired state district judge perry 
pickett recommended that brandley get a new trial because the 
previous two had been tainted with racism 
in wednesdays decision the austinbased appeals court said the 
states investigation of the slaying led to a trial that lacked 
the rudiments of fairness and ordered brandley released to the 
custody of the montgomery county sheriff for a possible new trial 
montgomery county district attorney peter speers said wednesday 
he was obviously disappointed with the courts ruling 
i felt the conviction should have been upheld said speers 
who declined to comment further until he had reviewed the courts 
decision he planned a thursday afternoon press conference 
possibly to discuss whether he will pursue a third trial 
prosecutors have maintained that brandley is guilty and denied 
allegations that he was the subject of racial discrimination 
brandley is the third texas inmate in a year whose conviction 
has been set aside in cases that have drawn national attention 
the court set aside the capital murder conviction of randall 
dale adams whose case was the subject of the movie the thin blue 
line for the 1976 slaying of a dallas police officer the court 
later set aside the robbery conviction of joyce ann brown a dallas 
woman who prosecutors say will be tried again for her alleged part 
in the 1980 robbery of a fur store 
the court said the outrage over the teenagers murder cannot 
justify the subversion of justice that took place during the 
investigation which ultimately affected the trial of her accused 
perpetrator 
brandleys attorney mike degeurin of houston said he would ask 
the court to set bail for his client and hoped brandley would be 
home for christmas 
the appeals court refused wednesday afternoon to set bond and 
degeurins bail motion in a galveston district court was not ruled 
on by late wednesday afternoon from the 122nd district court in 
galveston 
brandleys attorneys offered evidence that police and montgomery 
county prosecutors had set out to prove that brandley the only 
black janitor at the school was guilty rather than seeking the 
real killer 
another janitor who testified for the state allegedly was 
threatened by a texas ranger and the state suppressed information 
that could have implicated someone other than brandley according 
to examples of improper investigation cited by the appeals court 
im sitting here screaming having a fit im so happy said 
rose upshaw of the free clarence brandley coalition a 200member 
houstonbased group that has fought to keep brandleys case in the 
public eye were just excited we just cant believe it 
thankyou jesus said brandleys mother minnie ola 
brandley when she was told of the courts decision pray for us 
and lets hope everything works out 
im thrilled to death for clarence and his family said 
james beathard a fellow inmate but i hope nobody out there 
makes the corny comment that the system works the system failed 
clarence its been eight years and there are more and more of 
these cases coming up

the government announced its economic recovery 
plan wednesday promising five more years of bureaucratic control 
of such mundane details of life as the number of eggs produced for 
each soviet consumer 
premier nikolai ryzhkov rejected radical reforms like the 
legalization of private property and the selling off of 
moneylosing state enterprises drawing immediate scorn from 
disappointed progressives in the soviet parliament 
if bureaucrats really want to raise annual egg production 
targeted at 285 per person by 1995 they should raise chickens 
economist and parliamentarian gavriil popov told parliament known 
as the congress of peoples deputies 
five years ago we said it was a choice between fiveyear 
plans and perestroika and unfortunately it turns out the 
fiveyear plan has won said fellow deputy pavel bunich in the 
lobby outside the snowcovered kremlins palace of congresses 
the government proposal shifts the emphasis of traditional 
central planning away from heavy industry to consumer goods and 
services they are to quadruple in the next fiveyear plan from 
199196 it also would transfer some control from bureaucrats in 
moscow to those in the republics 
elsewhere in the east bloc wednesday 
czechoslovakias opposition and communists agreed that the 
president should be elected by parliament before jan 31 according 
to negotiators there was no agreement on who would become 
president only that the person would be a czech not affiliated to 
any political party 
that seems to point toward opposition leader vaclav havel a 
symbol of the countrys peaceful revolution earlier the new 
oppositiondominated government said it is drafting laws ensuring 
freedom of religion assembly and association 
bulgarias communist party expelled todor zhivkov the 
hardline leader ousted last month after a 35year rule and agreed 
to join other warsaw pact parties in surrendering its guarantee of 
supreme power 
communists in east germany said talk of reunification raises 
the specter of a fourth reich but west german plans for 
massive aid infusions indicate the countries are quickly coming 
together 
poles marked the eighth anniversary of the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown which solidarity leader lech walesa said should be a 
reminder of the need for pluralism and tolerance 
poland and hungary outlined their economic reforms at a 
meeting in brussels with 24 western nations that are coordinating 
aid to prevent eastern europes reforms from being derailed by 
economic troubles 
ryzhkov said the kremlin believes it can salvage the sinking 
soviet economy without resorting to western economic models he 
claimed his plan was a radical reform for carrying the economy 
out of a crisis 
food and consumer goods are in painfully short supply and 
authorities are wondering whether theyll have enough fuel to heat 
apartments through the long winter 
moscow deputy yuri andreev said the plan was so bad he hoped the 
congress would throw it back at the government for a complete 
rewrite moreover he suggested the ministers responsible be 
replaced 
the governments moves toward a market economy are vague and 
fragmented dooming them from the start said popov one of 300 
deputies who signed up to comment 
you cant assemble it gradually he said you cant have 
the carburetor working while the starter is idle if the motor is 
working it must be working completely 
enterprises are drowning not because they dont know how to 
swim but because the center has tied their hands he said 
ryzhkovs program was a clear victory for the conservatives who 
dominate the parliament ryzhkov even rejected the program of his 
own top economist deputy premier leonid abalkin who had urged the 
sale of unprofitable state enterprises beginning in 1991 
communist party agriculture chief yegor k ligachev stood up to 
reject reformers suggestions that small peasant holdings could 
solve the countrys food crisis he said the only reason huge 
collective farms cannot feed the soviet people is lack of 
technology and cash and announced that they turned a profit of 10 
billion last year for the first time in their 60 years of 
existence 
it was not clear how ligachev arrived at the profit figure 
while this years harvest was good there have been no reports of 
drastic improvements in farm productivity or increases in state 
prices that would explain such a sudden jump in profits 
the proposal calls for control to shift from bureaucrats in 
moscow to bureaucrats and factory managers in the republics 
despite lip service to creation of a socialist market consumer 
demand still would not drive soviet decisions about design 
production and distribution 
does this mean we abandon planning of course not ryzhkov 
said we have to leave free to the market only that part of 
production that would not lead to unbalancing the economy 
price reform would be postponed until 1991 and 1992 and even 
then some would remain under state control 
the soviet union desperately needs to reform its stateset 
prices which waste enormous resources by charging too little for 
scarce and expensive goods 
ryzhkov indicated that every plan for price reform had been 
opposed 
the program did include surface changes including the creation 
of government bonds raising interest rates and longterm land 
leasing 
the 2250member parliament interrupted the premiers 1hour 
45minute speech with lukewarm applause only when ryzhkov declared 
the state would remain the owner of means of production 
factories and equipment 
ryzhkov said the government would begin using more economic 
rather than managerial means to run the economy in a second stage 
of reform beginning in 1993 he specifically cited control of 
prices credit and investment 
his report appeared to contain nothing that would give soviets 
an incentive to work efficiently

despite concerns about security the white 
house said wednesday that president bush will go to violencetorn 
colombia on feb 15 for a fournation summit on illegal drugs 
the meeting expected to last one day will be in cartagena on 
colombias north coast 
the region is infamous as a haven for cocaine druglords who are 
waging a campaign of violence in retaliation for a crackdown by the 
government of president virgilio barco 
other participants in addition to bush and barco will be 
president alan garcia of peru and president jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia 
on monday bush had expressed determination to attend the summit 
but said a final decision was still pending and i will not do 
anything imprudent 
praising barco for battling the drug cartel bush has said i 
dont want to undermine the courageous stances hes taking and 
i dont want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should 
go to colombia because they cant be protected 
one top administration official said wednesday night the drug 
summit probably will be held at a colombian naval base the 
official said that for better overall security the entire 
washington entourage including staff and the press corps would 
remain at the same location rather than operating from separate 
site than the talks as is often the case on presidential foreign 
trips 
wednesdays announcement came after bush signed legislation 
authorizing 240 million in aid for colombia bolivia and peru to 
help the andean nations wage their war against drugs 
the three south american nations are the source of most of the 
worlds cocaine supply 
bush had promised the increased aid as part of the antidrug 
strategy he unveiled sept 5 
the legislation authorizes spending 115 million for narcotics 
control assistance and 125 million for military and law 
enforcement aid to the three countries 
bush reiterated his commitment to help the nations that form 
the front lines of the struggle against the drug cartels 
disrupting and dismantling the criminal organizations that 
support the international production processing and trafficking of 
drugs are essential components of our national drug control 
strategy he said 
the violence in colombia since president virgilio barco declared 
war on the drug cartels shows that they are entrenched and 
powerful international cooperation is essential if they are to be 
defeated and the united states in particular must be generous in 
providing assistance bush said 
the measure waives restrictions on using us foreign aid to 
train police it also raises from 500000 to 2 million the 
rewards the united states will pay for information leading to 
arrest and prosecution of international terrorists 
while praising congress for this timely response to my 
request bush also registered an exception to a provision that 
would allow either house to block aid if the state department fails 
to submit certain reports bush regards any such legislative veto 
provision as unconstitutional

education seminar in san antonio texas the lay church group that 
sent casolo to el salvador to conduct nonpartisan tours of the 
country for church workers and visiting officials 
wallace who wept as she spoke of casolo said we hope this 
helps stop the persecution of church workers thats going on in el 
salvador this confirms our standing all along of her 
innocence 
casolos father john casolo speaking at a news conference 
wednesday in the wethersfield conn office of sen christopher 
dodd thanked volunteers and officials for bringing our daughter 
home her mother audrey casolo added i am deeply grateful to 
each and every one who has believed in jennifer and her innocence 
dodd who had spoken by telephone several times with cristiani 
over the last several days said the decision to free casolo was a 
favorable development in relations between the two countries 
i welcome this announcement for the signal it sends about the 
legal system in el salvador a system that has not exactly 
distinguished itself for fairness or even humaneness in recent 
years dodd said 
dodd a moderate democrat who has supported military aid to 
cristianis government praised cristianis handling of the matter 
and stressed that he had made no threats or promises about his 
support for continued us aid 
there were no deals there are no conditions on aid dodd 
said 
sen joseph lieberman dconn said the release of casolo 
certainly avoids what could have been a disaster in terms of 
their relationship with the united states 
he added the result whether it was judicially motivated or 
politically motivated or both is very positive 
but other congressmen said the resolution of casolos case does 
not resolve problems for church workers still held in el salvador 
rep jim mcdermott dwash who visited casolo in prison said 
there are many individuals who do not receive such fortunate 
treatment and who do not have the benefit of so many friends in 
america our relief at jennifers release must not diminish our 
concern for the many other church workers she leaves behind 
and sen john kerry dmass and an opponent of military aid to 
el salvador predicted that persecution of other church workers 
would not end 
one has to ask if the government did not have the evidence to 
bring her to trial why did it see fit to deport her he 
commented 
friends and officials viewed the decision to expel casolo as 
necessary to protect her 
steve gans a brandeis university classmate of casolos said 
its not a fair result in the sense that any sort of guilt would 
come with that 
wallace said she was very sensitive to how she feels about 
leaving the country casolo has been in el salvador since 1985 
and has said she wanted to stay even if that meant standing trial 
dodd said he too regretted the expulsion but added that in 
terms of personal safety it is probably in jennifers best 
interest

william j bennett on wednesday described the 
views of those who advocate the legalization of drugs as stupid 
and morally atrocious 
it doesnt make any sense bennett director of the office 
of national drug control policy said in an interview 
it is becoming something of a fashion to believe this in 
certain circles of opinion but even though its fashionable its 
still every bit as dumb and compassionless as it was before 
bennett pressed his counteroffensive against the increasingly 
outspoken ranks of those arguing for drug legalization a day after 
us district judge robert w sweet said drugs including cocaine 
and heroin should be legalized taxed and dispensed by the state 
because the war on narcotics is being lost 
sweet a republican and former prosecutor appointed by president 
carter as a trial judge in the southern district of new york said 
it was time to abolish the prohibition to cease treating 
indulgence in mindalteration as a crime 
bennett who denounced such views in a speech at harvard 
university on monday said wednesday that he is unswayed by the 
growth in the number of legalization advocates or by the fact that 
they cut across the political spectrum and include for the first 
time a federal judge 
vice president dan quayle visiting kansas city said the judge 
was simply out of step with mainstream america we totally 
reject the idea that the way to solve the drug problem challenging 
america is to simply roll over and legalize it its not going to 
happen in the bush administration 
judges arent any more immune to ignorance than people in 
other professions bennett said 
if he doesnt like his work if hes tired of sentencing 
people he should find another line of work bennett said about 
sweet its better to have clogged courts than crowded 
jammed pediatric wards of cocaine babies which we will have a lot 
more of if we take his proposal seriously 
the legalization argument is as stupid and morally atrocious 
as it ever was bennett said 
sweet in tuesdays speech before the new yrk cosmopolitan club 
said the result of drug legalization would be the elimination of 
the profit motive the gangs the drug dealers obviously the 
model is the repeal of prohibition and the end of al capone and 
dutch shultz 
sweet was harshly criticized by other officials including sen 
alfonse damato rny 
judge sweet is absolutely wrong damato said if his 
policy were accepted he would be consigning millions of more to 
lives of addictions he would be responsible for the deaths of 
millions more it is a policy that is irresponsible 
sterling johnson jr the special new york state prosecutor for 
narcotics agreed with damato 
this is a classic case of sweet going sour johnson said 
pat walsh sweets secretary said the judge was conducting a 
trial wednesday and was not available for comment 
the ranks of drug legalization advocates include conservative 
political commentator william f buckley economist milton friedman 
and baltimores democratic mayor kurt schmoke 
president reagans secretary of state george p shultz rattled 
the bush administration by stating similar views in a speech given 
at stanford university and excerpted in the wall street journal in 
october 
bennett said he doesnt believe the arguments will change the 
basic views of most americans theyve seen it up close anybody 
who has seen a child go through this is not likely to be moved by 
this abstract argument 
bennett said he opposes legalizing any kind of drug even 
marijuana despite the fact that he doesnt believe its more 
harmful than alcohol 
the last thing i would want to do is recommend the wider use 
of a drug that makes young people stupid we have enough of a 
problem with liquor thank you 
but hes not advocating a return to prohibition we cant go 
back societys made a judgment its ok but we certainly dont 
have to compound the problem

britain said wednesday the way to end 
apartheid in south africa is by gradually lifting economic 
sanctions as the government dismantles its segregation system 
rather than imposing a trade embargo 
attempts to isolate the government of south african president 
fw de klerk are not the answer british ambassador sir crispin 
tickell told the general assemblys special session on apartheid 
nor are sanctions they certainly weaken the south african 
economy and in doing so they increase misery and poverty in 
particular among the most vulnerable parts of the community its 
black majority he said 
their political effect is to increase resistance to change 
rather than to encourage it tickell said when mr de klerk 
does take the necessary steps we believe it would then be right to 
lift some of the measures imposed by the international community 
so as to acknowledge progress and encourage south africa to proceed 
further down the path of dialogue 
tickells advice received polite applause in the 159member 
general assembly the overwhelming majority of nations believe 
south africa is implementing limited reforms only in response to 
the limited sanctions imposed so far 
most nations favor a total mandatory trade embargo against 
south africa butthe united states and britain have used their veto 
power in the security council to consistently block such moves 
a general assembly call for all nations to sever economic 
military sports and cultural links with south africa also has met 
with partial success 
apartheid has established a racially segregated society in which 
the 28 million south african blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

dulzura calif the death of a man apparently mauled by a pack 
of dogs could lead to a criminal investigation of the animals 
owners whose fearful neighbors had complained about marauding 
dogs the sheriffs office said 
preliminary findings of the autopsy wednesday will be available 
thursday morning but if it attributes 69yearold roy johnsons 
death to the dogs the criminal probe would ensue sheriffs lt 
john tenwolde said wednesday 
a lot of questions need to be asked before we can speculate 
about what the outcome is going to be tenwolde said 
on tuesday johnson was attacked near the charles duarte ranch 
where the dogs apparently lived while he was walking to work 
duarte was unavailable for comment but his wife cindy said 
it has never happened before i cant imagine what happened 
bill delany caretaker of the monahan ranch where johnson 
worked found the body after driving to pick up his newspaper at 
his mailbox off the highway 
it was unbelievable delany said he appeared to have been 
eaten alive thats the only way to describe it he was eaten 
alive i just knew he was gone 
john slough an offduty san diego policeman who lives nearby 
went to investigate what he thought was a dogfight and found two 
dogs picking at the body they attacked him and he shot and killed 
one and wounded another police said 
sally hazzard head of the san diego county animal control 
department said seven dogs licensed to duarte had been impounded 
hazzard said the dog wounded by slough was being treated by 
department veterinarians she said all the dogs would remain in 
department custody 
the department has had contacts with mr duarte and his dogs 
prior to the unfortunate incident and all documentation relative to 
those contacts have been forwarded to the sheriffs homicide 
unit hazzard said 
johnson had complained in the past about the unrestrained dogs 
and family members said he had been bitten on at least one other 
occassion 
his friends and relatives also said the dogs owners have 
refused repeated requests to keep their pets fenced in or on 
leashes 
muriel curtis a neighbor said she no longer walks along the 
dirt roads because of the dogs 
those dogs were so vicious that even when they were behind a 
fence my dogs panicked curtis said i had to give up my walks 
because those dogs were so threatening 
san diego police investigator pete solomonsen who is married to 
johnsons niece deanne said the dogs often run in a pack of six 
to 12 menacing neighbors and passersby 
delany said the dogs always chase my truck and theyve 
attacked me on my horse

reportedly under investigation by federal authorities when he put a 
gun in his mouth and fired suffered swelling in his brain 
wednesday a hospital spokesman said 
doctors said that was to be expected and treated the condition 
with drugs and gentry crowell 57 remained in critical but stable 
condition at vanderbilt university medical center said spokesman 
wayne wood 
crowell was found tuesday morning by one of his sons on the 
porch of his home in lebanon about 30 miles east of nashville the 
38caliber pistol was next to him 
he was taken to the hospital in nashville where he underwent a 
fourhour operation 
the nashville banner reported tuesday that federal authorities 
investigating illegal bingo gambling and public corruption had been 
closing in on crowell 
the banner quoted unidentified sources as saying that 
investigators were focusing on how crowell solicited political 
campaign money from architects engineers and bingo operators 
the investigation has lasted four years since january the 
probe has resulted in 22 people being indicted or pleading guilty 
crowells former chief bingo inspector wd donnie walker 
is serving a sevenyear federal prison sentence on a conviction 
that includes extorting payoffs from bingo operators 
his former assistant mary sue wright was named an unindicted 
coconspirator in an illegally operated memphis bingo hall and 
given immunity from prosecution she resigned in august before 
giving testimony before the us grand jury in memphis

the tennessee supreme court ruled it a lottery violating the state 
constitution 
republican state sen ronnie greer and bob lynch a former 
assistant us attorney who prosecuted former gov ray blanton on 
liquor license conspiracy charges said wednesday that the 
investigation had paralyzed state government 
i think it would be in everyones interest if this case were 
concluded said greer 
less than five months ago state rep ted ray miller of 
knoxville killed himself following published reports that he had 
taken bribes in connection with a knox county waste disposal 
project 
neither crowell nor miller had been indicted crowell testified 
before federal grand juries in nashville and memphis about bingo 
regulation 
the simple fact that this kind of investigation draws so much 
attention they prosecutors run the risk of destroying some 
peoples lives lynch said

bingocorruption case in nashville was unavailable for comment 
his office said 
lynch is defending state rep tommy burnett a democrat on

lawmakers on wednesday approved a 
bill affirming president corazon aquinos emergency powers after 
last weeks failed coup but limiting them to three months and 
rejecting some tough measures proposed to restore order 
mrs aquino declared an indefinite state of emergency dec 6 and 
this week asked congress to grant specific powers under the 
declaration 
the bill approved wednesday by the house of representatives 
limits the powers to 90 days the senate version could extend them 
up to six months the senate will resume debate on its version 
thursday 
renegade troops surrendered their last stronghold saturday after 
at least 113 people died in the rebellion that began dec 1 
however authorities say about half the estimated 3000 troops who 
took part in the coup attempt are still at large 
both congressional bills would let authorities search for 
weapons and ammunition in private homes without normal legal 
constraints 
but searches and seizures would be in the context of 
constitutional guarantees under the house version meaning a 
warrant would be required rep edcel lagman sponsor of the 
amendment said 
another amendment says measures to put down the rebellion must 
be within the protection of the bill of rights 
the house rules committee dominated by proadministration 
stalwarts proposed a sixmonth emergency period and its section on 
searches and seizures did not refer to constitutional guarantees or 
the bill of rights 
the house voted against letting mrs aquino intervene in labor 
disputes and suspend labor laws the senate version would keep the 
provision which critics regard as a virtual ban on strikes 
mrs aquino said she needed stronger powers to search for 
weapons and rebels still at large business groups asked for curbs 
on strikes to enhance confidence among investors 
sen juan ponce enrile denounced mrs aquinos emergency decree 
as a move toward dictatorship former human rights lawyer sen rene 
saguisag defended it because of the coup attempt 
emergency powers also could be used in extending the lease on 
the us military bases in the philippines and approving them would 
have dire implications for civil liberties said enrile a 
defense minister and martial law administrator under president 
ferdinand marcos from 1972 to 1981 
enrile broke with marcos and joined a popular uprising that 
installed mrs aquino as president in february 1986 and drove 
marcos into exile in hawaii where he died enrile later joined the 
opposition to mrs aquino 
defense secretary fidel ramos said wednesday that rebels who 
attempted the coup were still capable of staging terror attacks and 
assassinations he said the government will no longer seek us air 
cover over philippine territory 
us jets flew persuasion flights to discourage more bombing 
runs on the malacanang presidential palace and the military 
headquarters by rebel aircraft turning the tide in favor of the 
government on the first day of the mutiny

a connecticut woman accused of storing arms in her 
garden for leftist rebels returned to the united states on 
wednesday night after being freed from prison and deported from 
warravaged el salvador 
i dont think ive suffered as terribly as thousands of 
salvadorans have suffered here jennifer casolo 28 said in el 
salvador before boarding a commercial flight to miami 2 weeks 
after she was jailed on terrorism charges 
accompanied by us ambassador william walker at comalapa 
international airport casolo insisted on her innocence when she 
was allowed to speak briefly with a few pool reporters 
she said she signed a release statement acknowledging she was 
arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of having stored weapons and 
ammunition for rebels but added my position was always that i 
was innocent casolo said she believed her release supports that 
contention 
she telephoned her parents in thomaston conn from the 
airport walker said she told them shell be home for 
christmas he also said she had expressed the desire to return to 
el salvador someday 
she sounded confident her voice was loud and clear said 
her mother audrey casolo after talking with her daughter she 
sounded like a happy person she said she loved me very much 
president alfredo cristiani said earlier there was not enough 
evidence to continue holding casolo 
she was released into the custody of the ambassador who picked 
her up in a black cadillac escorted by jeeps on wednesday at the 
womens prison at ilopango on the eastern outskirts of the capital 
the caravan went to the airport and entered through a restricted 
entrance reporters were not allowed access either at the prison or 
airport 
casolo was put on an eastern airlines flight to miami and 
ushered to an undisclosed location upon her arrival said the rev 
daniel long chairman of christian education seminars who traveled 
with her on the plane 
it was a very emotional time for her being taken straight 
from the prison to the airport and deported because of her love 
for the people and the country of el salvador long said 
she decided late wednesday to remain in florida and not return 
immediately to her home in connecticut according to staffers for 
sen christopher dodd dconn who has followed the case 
her travel plans beyond that were undecided but church 
officials at the miami international airport news conference said 
casolo planned to hold a news conference sometime thursday 
in connecticut friends and wellwishers in her hometown 
prepared for her homecoming susan abbott a close high school 
friend of ms casolos put up a sign on the town green that said 
welcome home jennifer we love you 
cristiani told a news conference he thought casolo probably had 
cooperated with rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front who have fought ussupported governments for 10 years and 
launched a major urban offensive in san salvador last month 
i am morally convinced that miss casolo is guilty he said 
the case against casolo will proceed and she was asked to remain 
available in case judicial authorities need to question her 
further cristiani said 
evidence be it incriminating or exculpating will continue 
to be gathered the president said if the evidence against her 
becomes sufficient she will be summoned to return for trial 
he acknowledged that little could be done to make her come back 
to el salvador 
casolo and two salvadoran friends were arrested nov 26 in a 
police raid on her house she was charged with terrorism 
possessing weapons of war and criminal association all of which 
she denied there was no immediate word on the cases against those 
two salvadorans 
in the walled garden behind the house police said they dug up 
103 mortar shells 213 blocks of dynamite 405 detonators 150 feet 
of slowburning fuse and 21945 rounds of ammunition for 
sovietmade automatic rifles 
she said she did not know how the materiel got into the yard of 
her rented home on the northwestern edge of san salvador 
cristiani denied his rightist administration was pressured to 
free casolo by the united states the key financial supporter of 
his government 
the judges decision to release her is strictly judicial he 
said it is a political decision that we have made to deport 
her 
judge guillermo romero of the criminal court handled the case 
cristiani said he spoke with sen dodd who telephoned several 
times to ask about the case but at no time did sen dodd try to 
exert pressure indeed his position was that if there was 
sufficient proof against her her trial should go forward 
dodd said earlier wednesday he was told in telephone 
conversations with salvadoran officials including cristiani that 
casolo would be freed and expelled by thursday afternoon 
a statement issued by his office said cristiani informs me 
that the judge in her case has ultimately concluded the charges 
against jennifer were not fully supported by the evidence and that 
she could not thus be fairly prosecuted under salvadoran law 
casolo spent five years in el salvador working for christian 
education seminars which organizes tours for americans to learn 
about the civil war 
salvador ibarra her defense lawyer filed a writ monday 
requesting her release for lack of evidence cristiani said the 
judge ruled favorably on the writ 
her last us residence was in seattle and rep jim mcdermott 
dwash said wednesday i am glad for jennifers sake that she 
has been released because there were serious questions about the 
ability of the salvadoran judicial system to provide her a fair 
trial 
there are many individuals who do not have the benefit of so 
many friends in america our relief at jennifers release must not 
diminish our concern for the many other church workers she leaves 
behind

inderjit singh reyat 37 who worked in canada as an auto 
electrician before moving to coventry england in 1986 appeared

a federal judge wednesday refused to remove the 
late ferdinand marcos from liability in a lawsuit that accuses him 
of heading an antiopposition network that led to the killings of 
two political foes 
the ruling meant closing arguments will go as scheduled thursday 
in the 3weekold trial which claims silme domingo and gene 
viernes were fatally shot june 1 1981 because their antimarcos 
activities drew the attention of marcos intelligence agents 
the marcoses attorney richard hibey had asked us district 
judge barbara rothstein to order a directed verdict in favor of 
marcos and his widow imelda removing the case from the jury 
hearing the case 
other defendants in the case had opted to have rothstein judge 
their liability 
dr leonilo malabed a marcos friend who allegedly maintained a 
slush fund that paid 15000 for the murders asked rothstein to 
dismiss him from the case as did the philippines government 
rothstein did not immediately rule on the motions for imelda 
marcos malabed or the philippines hibey said 
three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that 
domingo and viernes were victims of an internal union dispute in 
the alaska cannery workers union both were union officers 
the two victims survivors have brought the wrongfuldeath 
lawsuit which seeks 30 million in damages 
hibey and malabeds attorney kate alfieri had asked rothstein 
to end the case against their clients on grounds that the 
plaintiffs had failed to show any direct link between their clients 
and the murders 
george greer a local attorney for the philippines government 
said he asked for dismissal under the foreign sovereign immunities 
act under the act government agents actions must be within the 
scope of their employment for the government to be liable he said 
the philippines argues that marcos actions against his 
opponents were done for his personal gain greer said not on 
behalf of the country from which he fled upon his overthrow in 
february 1986

the bush administration is considering lifting 
a ban on satellite exports to china continuing to chip away at 
sanctions imposed on beijing after its violent crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
president bush did not intend to disrupt normal civilian 
commercial relations when he barred military exports to china 
last spring and officials are reviewing the sanctions with that in 
mind white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
the news from the white house brought condemnation from rep sam 
gejdenson dconn chairman of house foreign policy subcommittee 
on international economic policy and trade he said the idea of 
lifting the sanction on satellites makes no sense whatsoever 
in china where the government has only tightened the screws 
the bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to 
try to do to help the chinese government gejdenson said

manufacturers of preying on the environmental concerns of 
american consumers to sell trash bags and other plastic items

erik sorenson recently became the second 
executive producer cbs this morning has had since its debut on 
nov 30 two years ago he has what some consider the morning 
version of mission impossible 
like its previous incarnations the twohour program remains a 
distant third in ratings against nbcs today and abcs good 
morning america like his precedessors on past and current cbs 
morning shows sorenson is expected to change that 
i dont think its impossible says sorenson 33 a former 
vice president of cbsowned kcbstv in los angeles i think its 
tough though 
that it is nielsen figures for last months important ratings 
sweeps local stations use the results to set advertising rates 
gave cbs morning a 25 ratings average well behind the abc 
and nbc shows they were tied with a 44 each ratings point 
represents 921000 homes 
but the nielsens contained a ray of hope for the cbs reveille 
team of harry smith and kathleen sullivan the ratings were up 
twotenths of a point from those of the previous november tiny 
yes but a start 
to improve on that sorenson in the custom of new producers 
plans some changes a different musical arrangement of the shows 
theme music more ratingsboosting travel and what he calls more 
visual variety 
no costly new set a staple of arriving executive producers is 
planned by sorenson a waukegan ill native whose background is 
in local news 
but he is trying to get name contributors on various topics 
among them chicagobased movie critic gene siskel best known from 
the syndicated siskel amp ebert filmreview series 
others contributors he says would report on parenting 
science the environment and aging 
in addition to his plans to rely more heavily on cbs 
correspondents he has hired two new fulltime staffers features 
reporter wayne freedman and hollywoodbased entertainment reporter 
steve kmetko 
and in a move that got his show some publicity last week he 
hired cbs sports reporter greg gumbel the brother of today 
cohost bryant gumbel to do sports segments and occasional fillin 
anchoring on cbs this morning 
but sorenson doesnt think his show will get a swarm of 
disaffected today viewers next month when jane pauley after 13 
years on nbcs show yields her cohost chair there to deborah 
norville 
certainly jane pauley has a big following and her departure 
is undoubtedly going to cause some of her followers to look around 
at what else is available he says 
but he theorizes that good morning america would be the 
chief beneficiary of any today viewer defection simply because 
it has been on since 1975 and like its nbc rival is a place of 
relative stability 
cbs in contrast still is trying to get back morning viewers 
who after all the years of change may have given up on it he 
says 
i think a lot of viewers dont realize that cbs is a viable 
alternative here and so i dont think we would stand to gain as 
much from this pauleys exit as perhaps gma will but i think we 
certainly stand to gain 
reassurances of stability in cbs morning effort might help aid 
its cause 
no doubt for that reason sorenson has been downplaying 
sullivans unusually frank comment last october on donahue that 
my days are numbered if her shows ratings dont improve 
asked if she and smith will continue as anchors all next year on 
cbs this morning sorenson immediately replied yes 
he laughed when advised that constitutes a ringing endorsement 
in network tv today he also added qualifying comments the anchor 
team of sullivan amp smith will remain to the extent that he has 
control of the situation 
obviously there are forces and factors out there in the world 
that could change that he said i suppose that if for some 
reason the show started bleeding and we started doing a 14 
rating for 12 weeks in a row somebody would have to say wait a 
minute theres a mistake somewhere 
but its our intention to stay the course stick with what 
weve got and improve on the program

the ruling political partys plan to put 
up africas tallest building in a park set aside 26 years ago for 
the common man stirred enough outrage in environmentalist wangari 
maathai that she went to court to stop it 
that raised the hackles of parliament which held her action to 
be tantamount to suing the head of state and the court eventually 
threw the case out as lacking merit 
but not before the issue raised a public outcry rarely seen in 
kenya officials found themselves accused of being irresponsible 
insensitive and unaccountable 
soon after independence from britain in 1963 kenyas first 
president jomo kenyatta dedicated the 10acre park on the edge of 
nairobi for the use of everyday kenyans he called it uhuru 
swahili for freedom 
today the park is an oasis that offers an inexpensive respite 
for nairobis thousands of day laborers many of them lacking 
money for lunch use the park for what sarcastically is known as an 
airburger a lunchhour nap 
after plans for the park were announced by the kenya african 
national union the nations only legal political party president 
daniel arap moi allowed debate to go on for a little more than a 
month then he assailed the buildings critics as having insects 
in their head and told them to shut up 
his order silenced most of the buildings detracters 
not mrs maathai she went to court despite parliaments threats 
to have her green belt movement treeplanting organization banned 
the park has a processional a pond with recreational row boats 
walkways and tiered levels for relaxing and picknicking it 
provides a getaway for the wananchi common people living in 
the crowded neighborhoods and slums ringing the city 
scores of citizens in letters printed by kenyas two independent 
newspapers pleaded with the government to put the complex elsewhere 
they like mrs maathai have been dismissed as ignorant and 
subversive by the governments most vocal stalwarts in a country 
where views contrary to the official position are strongly 
discouraged 
in a letter to the standard mrs r mwangi wrote i use the 
park with my family most weekends i see people there who have no 
other forms of recreation with their families men with wives and 
barefoot children but happy to have those moments of tranquility 
when they can forget the struggle of daily living 
please have a care for the wananchi we are already suffering 
from other problems 
kenyas leaders maintain the project will lend prestige to what 
already is one of africas most developed and prosperous cities and 
will provide thousands of needed jobs 
critics dont dispute these aspects of the project they say 
they just want the building moved to one of the other vast open 
areas surrounding the city 
the complex which is expected to cost 197 million and take 
about four years to complete will include a 60story main tower 
with a fourstory statue of president moi in front two 10story 
wings an auditorium parking for 2000 people and conference 
facilities for 5000 people even though a conference center 
already exists just a quarter of a mile from the proposed site 
in a public statement the architectural association of kenya 
protested putting the project in the park it contended the 
building will destroy the grassy belt on nairobis perimeter that 
earned the metropolis the name green city in the sun 
mrs maathai has earned the most vehement and vitriolic 
condemnation from parliament for her outspoken criticism of the 
building which has continued despite the presidents directive for 
people like her to shut up 
mrs maathai initially was reviled for her protests in letters 
to individual members of parliament the british high commissioner 
ambassador and the british media magnate robert maxwell who owns 
a share of the ruling partys media interests she also called on 
the people of nairobi to stand up and raise their voices 
she drew even harsher rebukes for seeking a court injunction to 
bar construction of the complex members of parliament assailed her 
12yearold green belt movement as bogus and subversive 
on dec 11 the high court dismissed her suit a nonstarter 
from the date of filing 
mrs maathai who before the ruling accused the court of being 
more concerned with politics than law said she was 
disappointed in the decision but would appeal it to the attorney 
generals office 
the most important thing is to rise and express ones opinion 
and say no when you should say no she said if we are not 
listened to then at least we have done what we could do within our 
own constraints

the fingerprints of an old china hand are 
showing 
president bushs overtures toward an unbending government in 
beijing are in line with the policy recommended by richard m 
nixon who reopened the us door to china 17 years ago in person 
and in memo nixon has urged bush to keep it ajar despite the 
deadly crackdown against democracy demonstrators a chinese hard 
line that remains in force 
bush sent two senior administration officials to beijing last 
weekend taking the first step toward repairing relations he 
defended the mission against a wave of democratic criticism and 
some republican skeptics by saying that isolating china would only 
make things worse 
nixon went to china six weeks ago the first prominent american 
visitor to confer with officials there since the government 
clampdown that began with the massacre in tiananmen square on june 
4 the former president then urged steps on both sides to improve 
relations and recommended exactly the kind of official mission 
bush then ordered 
the people and the policy involved in the controversial gesture 
to beijing are testament to nixons role as a central figure in 
uschina relations for nearly two decades a role that survived 
his watergate downfall 
directly or indirectly nixon has influenced china policy since 
the era of pingpong diplomacy 20 years ago prior to his 
breakthrough presidential journey to china in 1972 in 1974 nixon 
appointed bush to be us representative to china 
brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser and senior man 
on the beijing mission was a deputy to henry a kissinger when he 
was national security adviser in the nixon white house kissinger 
went secretly to china to prepare for nixons 1972 trip deputy 
secretary of state lawrence s egleburger the other half of the 
bush mission also is a onetime kissinger aide 
kissinger the former secretary state also visited beijing this 
fall and returned saying that the chinese should not be isolated 
that was the administration theme as bush and his spokesmen 
defended the scowcroft journey while acknowledging that the 
chinese had done nothing to moderate their crackdown on dissenters 
bush said the chinese know they will have to address human rights 
concerns to fully repair relations 
but i dont want to see that china remains totally isolated 
the president said monday after scowcroft returned and briefed him 
on the weekend mission 
there has not been normalization of relations because gen 
scowcroft at my request and it was my idea my suggestion went 
over there and had very high level talks in china bush said 
but the scowcroft visit included some of the trappings of normal 
relations including a state dinner and exchange of toasts with 
typically flowery words about cooperation and friendship the 
chinese apparently got to orchestrate the visit the schedule and 
the way it was announced at 2 am on a snowy saturday in 
washington the timing of the announcement was that the chinese 
asked that we not announce it until they arrived in china said 
white houseppress secretary marlin fitzwater 
while the white house said bushs economic and diplomatic 
sanctions against the chinese remain in place they appear to have 
been eased before the scowcroft mission with earlier toplevel 
contacts and with business dealings the president suspended the 
export of military weapons and defense articles to the peoples 
republic of china but did not intend to disrupt normal civilian 
commercial relations fitzwater said a suspension of 
international development bank loans remains in effect 
scowcrofts assignment was said to be to brief chinese leaders 
on the malta meetings between bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev he also was said to have expressed continuing us 
concern over the crackdown but fitzwater said the trip was not 
prompted by chinese concessions or internal changes 
he said both nixon and kissinger had urged bush to seek renewed 
contacts with top chinese officials nixon discussed his beijing 
visit with the president and his top advisers including scowcroft 
and eagleburger at a white house dinner early in november he also 
gave bush an 18page written report on his meetings with chinese 
leaders and his views on the way relations might be improved 
in a version he later made public the former president said the 
united states has a strong strategic interest in closer ties with 
china and suggested that the suspension of high level contacts had 
even then served its purpose in venting us outrage at the 
tiananmen crackdown 
isolation nixon said would only strengthen reactionary forces 
in china 
the administration should consider taking one step on its 
own now the resumption of contacts between high level 
administration officials and chinese officials nixon advised 
bush a month ago such an action should not require the chinese 
to act first 
thats what happened 
bushs democratic critics who deemed the original sanctions 
inadequate now accuse him of bending wavering and kowtowing to 
the chinese there are suggestions that they may vote for tougher 
sanction laws next year 
the political backlash over the bush gesture will depend in 
large part on what beijing does now the stickiest question is 
who goes first nixon had said in his china memo 
bush did

losing the fight to prevent an increase in the 
minimum wage has left the us chamber of commerce in a somewhat 
sullen mood about the immediate economic consequences 
it will the chamber says result in the loss of hundreds of 
thousands of job opportunities ignite a new round of wage 
inflation raise the deficit compromise us competitiveness and 
force some companies to forego expansion 
the chamber was in the forefront of opposition to the increase 
which takes the hourly minimum to 425 from 335 and it still 
smarts from the defeat saying it resulted when sound economics 
fell victim to political expediency 
more recently it expressed its ire in the business advocate a 
monthly newspaper delivered to members and opinion leaders saying 
the inrease will have a ripple effect on workers in higherpaying 
jobs 
when wages at one level increase employees at higher levels 
place a new and greater value on their services said bob martin 
director of the chambers employee relations policy center 
he said numerous studies concur in his finding that the increase 
will cost jobs he cited one by the congressional budget office 
that indicated between 125000 and 800000 jobs would be lost if 
the rate were raised to 455 as once proposed 
congress and the white house agreed however to a lesser 
increase bringing the minimum to 380 on april 1 1990 and to 
425 one year later it also permits a lower shortterm training 
wage for some teenagers 
martin cites a 1981 report by the minimum wage study commission 
named by former president carter that found that each 10 percent 
increase in the minimum wage has the potential to raise the 
nations payroll by 076 percent 
since the new law will raise the wage 27 percent the business 
advocate article concludes that labor costs will rise by about 205 
percent or more than 46 billion 
martin did express satisfaction that though we lost the last 
battle we saved businesses more than 9 billion by holding off a 
wage increase for the past three years and that it helped push 
through a training wage 
the latter opposed by organized labor will allow employers to 
pay a lower minimum wage for three months to firsttime workers 
under age 20 the training wage of 335 would begin april 1 1990 
rising to 361 a year later 
while the minimum wage puts a base under minimum wages in much 
of the nation it is already exceeded in other areas with some 
food outlets already paying 6 an hour or even more for unskilled 
workers 
the chamber article didnt address another criticism of the 
higher minimum one made by william dunkelberg dean of temple 
universitys business school that the increases might not be as 
effective as believed in reducing poverty levels 
dunkelberg testified during hearings held prior to the laws 
signing on nov 17 that many earning the minimum are not primary 
breadwinners in their families but instead are relatively 
comfortable people earning second incomes 
regardless of who gets the minimum wage and the automatic 
increases that lift it over the next two years the chamber said it 
expects those earning above the minimum are likely as a 
consequence of the law to want more 
expect wage pressure it warned

the crater of pan am flight 103 the 
deepest most visible scar on the town where it fell is 
disappearing under new homes 
at the end of november contractors began building 11 houses in 
sherwood crescent where the falling wreckage of the boeing 747 
killed 11 residents of lockerbie last dec 21 the final deaths of 
a terrorist bombing that killed the 259 passengers and crew of 
flight 103 
some people needed an awful lot of sustaining just to get to 
this week said malcolm mcgeorge who directs a team of social 
workers in the town 
the frustration that it has taken so long to rebuild has been 
very great crushing for some people others have little interest 
because they dont really want to go back but feel they have to go 
back because so much effort has been put in by so many people 
the crater has been filled and the street restored burnt shells 
of houses have been pulled down and only muddy vacant lots betray 
the extent of the destruction 
the construction reflects the determination to wipe out all 
traces of the disaster along the sidewalk of sherwood crescent 
however a lone pot of flowers testifies to a town torn between 
remembrance and forgetting 
lockerbie lost its quiet obscurity just after 703 that cold 
wednesday night when explosives hidden in a radiocassette 
recorder shattered the pan am jet maid of the seas at 36 
seconds past 703 the eskdalemuir observatory 15 miles from 
lockerbie recorded seismic shocks apparently caused by the falling 
wreckage 
the main part of the fuselage with enough jet fuel to push a 
747 from scotland to new york exploded in sherwood crescent 
shattered metal and flaming fuel spewed over dozens of houses and 
debris blocked traffic on the fourlane northsouth highway 
a forward portion of the fuselage landed across town in rosebank 
crescent the planes nose fell 3 miles from town across the road 
from the stone church at tundergarth 
the night it happened one of the first things i saw was the 
body of a child hanging in a tree said ronnie hall who lives in 
the rosebank area that child will never leave me 
the towns population of 3500 nearly doubled with the influx of 
a thousand police officers 700 military personnel 500 other 
volunteer and support workers and hundreds of reporters 
photographers and camera crews 
sheep now graze placidly where the planes nose fell and the two 
shattered houses in rosebank crescent have been rebuilt but the 
memories remain 
when you think the number of houses in rosebank that face in 
that small area where 61 bodies were found there must be more 
than a hundred people who could not avoid seeing that mayhem 
mcgeorge said 
sandy pelling assistant director of social work for the 
dumfries and galloway regional council recalled one family that 
identified with the young boy that was lying in their garden for 
two days they started grieving for him they wanted to know his 
name 
robert hunter whose home was 120 yards from the sherwood 
crescent crater brought his family back to the house two days 
after the disaster we wanted back in to settle the kids if 
nothing else he said 
repairs put them out of the house for six weeks however and it 
was 10 months before the job was complete but they never thought 
of moving he said 
before talking with a reporter hunter shooed his daughters out 
of the parlor talk of the disaster upsets them he said and with 
the onset of winter he realized his older daughter now 5 had 
become afraid of the dark 
we do talk about it with them on their own they understand 
what happened he said 
in the months after the disaster some adults as well as 
children had difficulty sleeping mcgeorge said 
there were reports of children not sleeping or having 
nightmares or playing what their parents thought were rather 
bizarre unsavory games playing airplanes and crashing them and 
so on he said but thats definitely understandable and 
people were encouraged to understand that was ok that it was a way 
of dealing with it 
he said there have been no reports of children developing 
serious behavioral problems 
i think the people with the serious and lasting problems are 
in the uniformed services just because of what they had to do 
in the recovery of bodies mcgeorge said 
the torn bodies reawakened some mens memories of combat 
service in one case going back to world war i he said for some 
women the disaster brought back moments of great personal loss 
of a husband a child or parents 
one of the things you hear people say is that they dont feel 
safe anymore if it happened once it can happen again mcgeorge 
said some of them are quite unable to use public transport 
buses or trains airplanes are just out of the question 
mcgeorge said some residents have admitted fearing the dark or 
the noise of a passing truck or express train when one lockerbie 
man took a train to london his wife kept the television on all day 
expecting news of a rail disaster 
reflecting on the work in lockerbie pelling talks about the 
timelessness of disaster for survivors 
it is there it has happened it is always going to be 
there he said while they desperately want to get this episode 
behind them and feel they are going forward they are not going to 
be able to shake off the night of the 21st in quite as easy terms 
agencies that came to help are thinking now of leaving 
i think we should melt away were another scar of the 
disaster said alex mcelroy who directs the community support 
office set up by the regional council 
mcelroys office runs by two clocks one set on us eastern 
standard time because some of its contacts are with authorities and 
insurors in the united states as well as with relatives of the 
american victims 
the approach of the anniversary made memories unavoidable on 
the afternoon of dec 21 the town will dedicate a monument in the 
dryfesdale cemetery bearing the names of the 270 dead a memorial 
service will be held that night outside the town hall used a year 
ago as a temporary mortuary some american relatives of victims 
plan to attend 
were hoping that after the 21st we can get back and have our 
town to ourselves said valerie moloney who works with a 
childrens group formed after the disaster 
hugh young a member of the district council agreed i think 
they see it as a watershed a time for looking forward again i 
think people hope the anniversary will be an end to the media 
attention

the wrenching disaster of pan am 
flight 103 had an unexpected side effect for this small market town 
the rebuilding effort has given residents the impetus to push 
for some renewal projects 
beyond paying to rebuild destroyed homes and other essential 
repairs the local government has borrowed money to refurbish 
dozens of units of public housing 
residents also pushed for better lights and street repairs and 
got them and now they are pressing plans for a park on the site of 
an abandoned factory 
we just took a good look at ourselves and decided we were 
being badly done by said ronnie hall vice chairman of a 
residents committee in the rosebank area 
were grasping the opportunity because now the regional 
council is very sympathetic to requests from lockerbie hall 
said i think they are things we should have pushed for years 
ago

for 12 months police have doggedly sought the 
bombers of pan am flight 103 but said little officially about the 
progress of their international manhunt 
heres what they have confirmed and what news reports have said 
following the explosion and crash that killed all 259 people on the 
plane and 11 on the ground last dec 21 
one week after the disaster britains department of transport 
confirmed a bomb blew up the boeing 747 and said investigators had 
found evidence of a powerful plastic explosive 
in february scottish police said the bomb was planted in a 
toshiba radiocassette player and probably checked in as hold 
baggage in frankfurt west germany where flight 103 originated 
west german police had seized similar bombs in october 1988 and 
arrested 16 members of a palestinian group all but two were soon 
released including marwan khreesat who some people believe 
assembled the bomb in frankfurt 
news reports have frequently pointed to the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command a radical palestinian 
group based in syria as the leading suspect the groups leader 
ahmed jibril repeatedly has denied involvement but has also 
reportedly boasted he was paid by iran to avenge the downing of an 
iranian airliner by a us warship hafez dalkamoni one of 
jibrils top aides is one of the two suspects still held in west 
germany 
some news reports said the bomb was smuggled to malta checked 
onto an air malta flight to frankfurt and transferred to pan am 
without an accompanying passenger others say the bomb began its 
journey in larnaca cyprus in a suitcase switched with one 
belonging to us intelligence officers returning home after 
looking for american hostages in lebanon 
a court in uppsala sweden last month identified mohammed abu 
talb a member of the palestine popular struggle front another 
radical faction as a suspect in the flight 103 bombing scottish 
police were permitted to remove clothing from his sweden apartment 
reportedly to compare with shreds of clothing found in the 
wreckage abu talb is awaiting verdicts due dec 21 on charges of 
murder and attempted murder in connection with four bombings in 
northern europe court documents show he was in malta in october 
1988 
us rep james traficant jr of ohio released portions of a 
report said to have been prepared for pan ams insurance 
underwriters that alleges the terrorists got the bomb aboard the 
plane through a ciaprotected drug smuggling ring at frankfurt 
airport the cia called the allegations nonsense

drug enforcement officials are declaring a 
partial victory in one battle of the war on drugs the diversion of 
prescription drugs to the illicit market 
cases of prescription drug abuse reported to the national drug 
abuse warning network have fallen by almost onethird since 1981 
but some medical professionals say the tougher new rules are 
preventing effective treatment of many americans with legitimate 
needs for such medication 
in 1981 131618 incidents of pharmaceutical abuse were reported 
to the warning network but by 1988 that number had dropped to 
88525 said gene haislip of the drug enforcement administration 
this is the one part of the drug problem where we have made 
genuine progress and reduced the size of it said haislip deas 
diversion control chief 
and yet the diversion of legal drugs remains a very large 
problem he said 
most frequently abused are the narcotic painkillers percodan 
dilaudid and codeine the stimulants amphetamine and preludin both 
prescribed for shortterm treatment of obesity the sedative 
doriden and tranquilizers such as valium librium xanax and 
diazepam 
the profit potential in diverted drugs is huge a single 4 
milligram tablet of dilaudid costs a bonafide patient about 60 
cents but can sell on the street for as much as 60 haislip says 
he estimates that up to 15 percent of the 25 billion 
prescription pills and capsules manufactured legally each year wind 
up on the street 
the drugs reach the black market through several routes 
physicians who intentionally write unnecessary prescriptions 
patients who convince doctors that they need the drugs when they 
dont pharmacies that falsify records and thefts from drug stores 
the authorities biggest weapons in the battle against 
diversions have been tighter regulation of physicians and 
pharmacies and monitoring of prescriptions 
some observers contend the requirements have made life more 
painful for patients with a legitimate need for frequently diverted 
drugs 
physicians go out of their way to avoid attracting the 
attention of regulatory agencies write physicians c stratton 
hill jr and william s fields in a new book drug treatment of 
cancer pain in a drugoriented society 
as a result they underprescribe the dosage of opiates and 
fail to provide patients with prescriptions for drug quantities 
sufficient to cover a reasonable time interval thus making 
frequent requests for resupply necessary the doctors write 
this prescribing behavior is humiliating for patients 
take the case of a texas minister highlighted in a documentary 
film by hill who works at a houston cancer center 
the baptist minister suffering from cancer and seeking a 
stronger painkiller from his doctor was rebuffed as if he were an 
addict 
youre a dope head and im going to dry you out while youre 
in here the minister quoted his physician as saying 
in an interview hill related the case of another patient who 
was receiving a toxic dose of acetaminophen because his docotor was 
prescribing it in combination with codeine rather than a stronger 
medication simply to avoid the scrutiny that attends 
prescriptions for the most frequently diverted painkillers 
the deas haislip said the federal regulation specifies that the 
legitimate treatment of pain should not be impeded he rejected 
arguments that physicians are hesitant about prescribing necessary 
drugs noting that morphine prescriptions rose 300 percent from 
1982 to 1986 
thats an enormous increase but the statistics do not show 
any such comparable increase in diversion for that drug which 
leads me to believe that it is for cancer and most all of it is 
legitimate haislip said 
however he acknowledged that some patients may have trouble 
finding pharmacies willing to carry certain controlled drugs a 
recent nationwide survey found that only 38 percent of responding 
drug stores routinely stock an oral morphine preparation in many 
cases because of fear of robbery 
while some doctors shy away from prescribing the most potent 
drugs a few others have made an illegal living from it officials 
cite the case of dr john hall thomas he ran two weightreduction 
clinics in texas and was writing about 45 percent of the 
prescriptions for preludin for the state of texas when arrested 
in 1982 said wilbur morris of the dea in dallas 
prosecutor chris harrison said at the time that investigators 
sent undercover agent allen byrd who is not overweight to one 
clinic to buy the stimulant 
thomas told him they would have to make it look legal so byrd 
would have to bring four fat girls with him harrison said he 
came back with the girls all law enforcement officers and got the 
prescriptions 
thomas originally indicted on 63 counts pleaded guilty in a 
plea bargain to one count of illegally prescribing the drug he 
lost his medical license and was sentenced to five years in prison 
morris said 
the federal controlled substances act of 1970 tightened the 
rules for those handling drugs with a potential for abuse such 
drugs are broken down into five categories or schedules 
schedule i drugs such as heroin have the highest potential 
for abuse but no accepted medical use and can be used only for 
research 
schedule ii drugs are the most dangerous and subject to abuse 
this category includes percodan dilaudid morphine and some 
codeine formulations as well as amphetamines and preludin federal 
regulations require that everyone who prescribes or handles 
schedule ii drugs register with the dea that manufacturers 
distributors and pharmacies complete special dea forms on every 
transaction that patients have a written prescription that cannot 
be refilled and that the drugs be kept in a safe by the 
manufacturer importer and distributor but not the pharmacy the 
dea even sets production limits 
schedule iii iv and v drugs pose a lesser danger and are 
deemed less subject to abuse doriden is a schedule iii drug and 
most tranquilizers are schedule iv schedule v includes many 
overthecounter narcotic preparations federal regulations for the 
schedule iii iv and v drugs are increasingly lenient 
nine states have gone beyond federal rules imposing a 
multiplecopy prescription system with most of the states 
requiring the physician the pharmacy and state officials to retain 
a copy of each prescription 
officials of the states california hawaii idaho illinois 
indiana michigan new york rhode island and texas say such 
programs enable them to spot those who seem to be prescribing or 
dispensing inordinate amounts 
all the state programs affect schedule ii drugs some include a 
few schedule iii drugs and new york citing an alarming number of 
prescriptions recently added the schedule iv sleeping pills and 
tranquilizers such as valium and librium 
officials say texas multiplecopy program helped crack the case 
of dr thomas although the long lines outside his clinics in 
dallas and nacogdoches already had attracted law enforcement 
attention 
the white house conference for a drug free america recommended 
in june 1988 that all states establish such programs and the dea 
supports them 
the american pharmaceutical association the american medical 
association and some drug companies oppose the programs citing 
concerns about patient care among others 
edwin webb the pharmaceutical associations professional 
affairs director said schedule ii prescriptions go down 
dramatically as soon as such programs are instituted and that can 
hurt patients who truly do need large quantities of medication

dewey and matilda houck have seen the 
drug war from the other side fighting a sometimes futile battle to 
obtain painkillers for a 5yearold daughter being destroyed by 
cancer 
they raced to hospitals at all hours of the day and night to get 
prescriptions for morphine that were good only for 48 hours 
searched the area for pharmacies that would risk the possibility of 
a breakin to carry the drug and tried to comfort their terrified 
daughter when she asked the unanswerable question why does this 
have to happen to me 
it is tragic enough to lose a child but its awful to live 
with the terror of her agony matilda said in an interview at her 
home in this washington dc suburb 
kendra laurel houck was born oct 28 1983 she died march 3 
1989 a sixmonth failure by doctors to diagnose her neural 
blastoma meant that when it was discovered in august 1986 the only 
options left were experimental treatments the doctors told the 
houcks their only child would have had a good chance of recovery 
had the cancer been diagnosed earlier 
instead for the next 2 years the family suffered through 
experimental treatments enjoyed a 10month remission doled out 
dosages first of codeine and demerol and later morphine celebrated 
kendras fifth birthday and learned all about the nations drug 
laws 
two days after halloween 1988 kendras condition deteriorated 
dramatically 
from that day on it became morphine and even that wasnt 
real effective said dewey 
she would be screaming on morphine said matilda a gentle 
woman whose voice wavered as she tried to restrain tears it just 
wasnt cutting the pain she was conscious and in agony 
by the time kendra died her eyes pressed open day and night by 
a brain tumor she was taking more than 100 milligrams of morphine 
every four hours 
to dewey the real issue is access to morphine 
the houcks found that very few pharmacies carry the drug out of 
fear of robberies those that do generally have very little on hand 
for the same reason dewey said pharmacies refused to tell him over 
the phone whether they carried morphine because they feared a 
holdup 
the prescriptions were good only for 48 hours which meant that 
in times of need they would race to childrens hospital in 
washington to get one from the doctors who knew kendras condition 
but they could not get the morphine there because kendra was at 
home not in the hospital 
eventually they found a pharmacist who knew their situation and 
would have the morphine ready when they needed it he sold it to 
them at cost 
even then the price was 494 for a typical threeday supply 
matilda said 
i felt like the sick and dying are paying the price for our 
drug war she said 
these are not radical antiestablishment people they did not 
attempt illicit street buys of heroin for kendras pain something 
experts say would not have helped her or marijuana for her nausea 
that would have been an option to us had we chosen to do it in 
an outlaw way dewey said but it would have been 100 percent 
inconsistent with their lifestyle in addition he said they 
were concerned how kendras mix of drugs had it included heroin or 
marijuana would have affected her 
merely handling the morphine seemed odd to dewey 
it was strange to fool with this stuff that was verboten he 
said we had jugs full of it and we could not get enough for 
kendra 
after kendra died the nurse immediately cleared out all the 
leftover controlled substances destroying them in the presence of 
another healthcare professional 
i didnt understand why i couldnt just flush it down the 
toilet with the valium he said

the 1990 lexus ls 400 is a car drivers will want to live in 
i did the ls 400 test car had better soundproofing than my 
apartment and an ambience several notches higher it further beat 
out my abode by coming equipped with an automatic compact disc 
player operating by remote control from the trunk 
as a friend noted this is a car that you wouldnt mind riding 
in even if you had a horrendous commute in fact youd look 
forward to it 
such is the calming influence of the lexus the first of a new 
breed of japanese imports designed to lure buyers from such upscale 
european luxury cars as mercedesbenz bmw and jaguar 
early indications are that the ls 400 the larger of the two 
lexus models available is a worthy competitor 
lexus transports you literally and figuratively into another 
dimension says car and driver magazine the cars smoothness 
and air of total integration is both a wonder and a delight 
automobile magazine says another master stroke from the land 
of the perfect machine 
both magazines have named the ls 400 one of their top 10 autos 
of the 1990 model year 
what is so alluring about the ls 400 after all on the outside 
this toyota product is understated the rounded front end resembles 
that of a mercedes 
my first clue to the pampering offered by the ls 400 was the 
electronic steering wheel that automatically tilts and telescopes 
in or out to a preset position as the key fits into the ignition 
the steering wheel also contains an airbag 
then came the whispersoft startup for the first couple of 
times i needed to check the automatic lights on the test cars 
dashboard to confirm the engine had started on the road the car 
was equally quiet goodyear worked 18 months to develop a tire that 
meets toyotas rigid standards for that peaceful ride 
i also admired the smooth shifting of the fourspeed automatic 
overdrive transmission i barely noticed as the powerful 32valve 
v8 engine and welltuned transmission went through their paces and 
the antilock brakes were the most sensitive ive encountered 
finally was the attention to detail 
front seats were wide and comfortable with electronic controls 
for personal adjustments even the headrests were electronic 
toyota used a computer to study passengers weight distribution so 
the seat design would ease fatigue 
the height of the seatbelt anchors also were electronically 
adjustable so shorter people dont have to tolerate chafing at the 
neck with the touch of a button the belt could be lowered on the 
door post 
the power window buttons were welldesigned to accommodate even 
long fingernails toyota had its engineers put on fake nails before 
deciding the final design of the window buttons 
the premium sound system with the remote cd player in the 
trunk was superb the changer holds six compact discs selected 
before the drive begins and is operated from the dashboard panel 
a convenient twocup holder popped out from the center armrest 
and the spacious trunk contained a nifty first aid kit complete 
with travel case and an auto repair kit 
the ls 400 is larger and more popular than the other lexus 
model the es 250 company spokeswoman mindy weiman said that of 
the more than 9000 lexus vehicles sold since the line was 
introduced in september the majority are ls 400s 
target buyers are baby boomers entering their peak earning 
years she said noting that the number of americans aged 35 to 65 
will grow from 78 million to 94 million into the next decade 
household income of the lexus buyers will be 50000plus weiman 
said 
early lexus sales showed the interest of import owners among 
the first 1000 buyers 35 percent traded in european imports 
while 20 percent traded in japanese models weiman said twenty 
percent traded in domestic vehicles 
in its competition with the european luxury cars the lexus has 
an advantage in price and a disadvantage as the new kid on the 
block 
the ls 400 starts at 35000 thousands less than the mercedes 
300e at 39950 and the lowestpriced jaguar the 39700 xj6 
fourdoor sedan but lexus doesnt have the years of name 
recognition granted the bmw mercedes or jaguar nameplates 
that does not deter toyota from predicting sales of 16000 lexus 
cars this year with sales next year set for 75000 
the ls 400 is a new vehicle so consumer reports does not list 
owner complaints but in early december toyota recalled all 8000 
ls 400s to fix a sticky cruise control mechanism and replace a 
defective stoplight cover that would melt if the light was left 
burning 
in addition lexus mechanics were also to make sure a connector 
between the alternator and the battery was seated properly if not 
clicked into place battery power could be drained lexus spokesman 
kurt von zumwalt said

a weak advertising market for newspapers in the 
northeast is part of the reason for times mirror incs declaration 
that it is unlikely to have higher operating earnings this year and 
for a big charge against fourth quarter earnings at the new york 
times co 
times mirror executives told securities analysts on tuesday that 
higher circulation costs at its los angeles times newspaper and a 
settlement of a legal dispute also figured in its projection of a 
possible decline in operating earnings for 1989 if operating 
earnings decline it would be the first such drop at times mirror 
since 1982 
separately the new york times co announced a 44 million 
charge against fourth quarter earnings due to its investment in 
its forest products operation and estimated costs related to 
expected voluntary union staff cuts at the new york times its 
flagship newspaper 
the staff cuts which are expected to involve mainly production 
workers were attributed to weak advertising volume in the new york 
region and further automation of printing and production facilties 
analysts who follow the newspaper business have said they expect 
ad revenue growth for newspapers to remain sluggish next year 
particularly in the northeast where the economy appears weaker than 
in other regions 
times mirror a media and information company based in los 
angeles owns the los angles times and several eastern newspapers 
including newsday new york newsday the hartford courant and the 
baltimore sun newspapers 
the companys earnings from operations were up 7 percent for the 
first nine months of 1989 to 162 a share from 158 a share a 
year earlier 
but robert f erburu the companys chairman and chief 
executive told analysts at painewebbers 17th annual media 
conference that it was was unlikely the company would continue to 
show yeartoyear improvement in operating earnings for the full 
year 
erburu cited the difficult operating environment facing the 
companys newspapers in the northeast the costs of trying to sign 
up new subscribers after the nov 2 closing of the rival los 
angeles herald examiner and a 5 million settlement of a legal case 
involving times mirrors cable tv operations 
david laventhol president of times mirror said while the los 
angeles times was turning in a solid year with increases in 
both retail and classified advertising the companys eastern 
papers were reporting ad revenues barely even with a year ago with 
classified advertising lineage down 7 percent 
for 1988 times mirror earned 3319 million or 258 a share 
on revenue of 333 billion operating earnings amounted to 227 a 
share 
times mirror said it has stepped up its costcontainment program 
to offset some of the volatile economic and market conditions 
expected next year 
we have good reason to believe that we can show improvement in 
1990 barring an economic downturn erburu said 
in addition to newspapers and cable operations times mirror 
owns four television stations and publishes magazines and books 
in a news release tuesday the new york times co said 35 cents 
of its 57 cent per share charge in the fourth quarter stemmed from 
a determination that it would not fully recover an equity 
investment in its forest products operation the market for 
newsprint has been glutted with supply 
the remaining 22 cents per share of the charge stemmed from 
estimated expenses of voluntary union staff reductions at the new 
york times the company has been in talks with its printers and 
plans to talk with other unions for production workers about staff 
reductions spokeswoman nancy nielsen said 
the reductions stem from weak advertising volume in the new york 
region and automation of newspaper production in the composing 
room the planned closing of a printing facility at carlstadt 
nj and the opening of an automated printing and distribution 
facility in edison nj in late 1990 
the company did not estimate earnings for the fourth quarter 
ending dec 31 
for the first nine months of 1989 the company earned 2856 
million or 363 a share on 130 billion in revenue 
the new york times is a diversified communications company that 
publishes newspapers and magazines operates television stations 
and syndicates news and feature stories worldwide it also owns 
substantial interests in paper mills and has a stake in the 
parisbased international herald tribune

a general motors corp bulletin sent to chevrolet 
dealers apparently turned into more orders for cars to be built in 
january a company spokesman says 
the bulletin said dealer orders through nov 22 were far below 
scheduled production and warned of plant shutdowns if the pace 
didnt pick up 
the bottom line is whatever signals we sent to the dealers in 
late november clearly had an effect said chevrolet spokesman 
ralph kramer 
as of tuesday the 4800 chevrolet dealers had ordered about 
75000 cars from the january production of nearly 91000 kramer 
said that was up substantially from the 24130 cars that dealers 
had requested as of nov 22 he said 
it is critical that all dealers immediately analyze their 
product needs and submit orders immediately said the bulletin 
quoted in a story in mondays automotive news trade journal 
adequate order banks are necessary to maintain uninterrupted 
production 
theres no kidding about it kramer said were scratching 
for every order we can get and our dealers are scratching for every 
sale that they can get 
frank anderson owner of sir walter chevroletgeo in raleigh 
nc said his business never received the bulletin he said he has 
been trimming orders for 1990 vehicles because of costs of keeping 
them on hand 
gm officials have contacted his dealership nearly daily giving 
us the opportunity to order some more vehicles anderson said he 
has resisted largescale orders opting instead to keep his 
inventory in the 45 to 50day range 
i think in their gms selling they couldnt hesitate to 
mention the fact that there may be some plant closures in january 
and february even in some of the hotter lines anderson said 
as we see it right now thats their problem our immediate 
problem is selling vehicles 
chevrolet and geo sales for the first 11 months of this year 
were 1262158 cars down 73 percent from the same period last 
year 
last week gm announced that some of its car and truckmaking 
plants in canada and the united states would close briefly in 
january because of slumping dealer orders 
even before the 1990 model year got off to its official start on 
oct 1 dealers were saying they planned to cut orders from 
manufacturers by up to 30 percent 
ron tonkin president of the national automobile dealers 
association has urged the 20000 members of his organization to 
cut orders even more to avoid costs of holding large inventories of 
cars on their lots

takeover turmoil continued to cloud the future of 
united airlines as directors of parent ual corp gathered for 
todays regularly scheduled board meeting at the companys 
chicagoarea headquarters 
a new employee buyout plan that uals management drafted was 
received cooly by leaders of uniteds pilots and flight attendants 
and ripped by the powerful machinists union 
their response apparently has left chairman stephen wolf without 
a firm proposal for raising uals stock price and staving off 
disgruntled investors 
opposition from the machinists helped scuttle a 675 billion 
pilotmanagement bid for the nations secondlargest airline in 
october and their support is considered important to the success of 
a revised offer 
the machinists represent about 25000 of uals 70000 workers 
the plan floated by ual management in meetings with employee 
groups would value ual at 240 a share or 543 billion the 
chicago tribune reported tuesday quoting unidentified sources 
the plan envisions ual employees owning about twothirds of the 
stock and public stockholders about onethird the tribune said 
ual management would invest 30 million for a 2 percent stake in 
the company and be granted options for another 6 percent the 
report said 
if thats the deal its unacceptable we will oppose it 
said brian freeman an adviser to the machinists in a telephone 
interview from his roseland nj office 
freeman said ual representatives had not met with the machinists 
regarding a revised buyout plan he said the machinists objected to 
the price and other terms of the deal outlined in the tribune but 
he would not elaborate 
uals stock climbed 275 to 17675 in early new york stock 
exchange trading 
the machinists biggest complaint about the earlier 
300ashare ual buyout plan was that it would require an 
unacceptable level of borrowing the deal which had been approved 
by uals board failed when lenders backed away citing the 
machinists opposition 
the failed bid would have given ual workers 75 percent of the 
company with management owning 10 percent and british airways plc 
15 percent 
james conley a spokesman for the machinists in washington said 
the union also objected to any transaction involving uals two top 
officers wolf and executive vice president john pope 
representatives from ual and from the united chapters of the air 
line pilots association and the association of flight attendants 
declined comment on the tribune report 
ual officials have said the pilots were given the proposal more 
than a week ago united pilots have not publicly stated their 
opinion of the plan but their leader frederick dubinsky said last 
week his union would not be rushed into a transaction 
patricia friend president of the united flight attendants 
union said they were given the proposal last week and are still 
studying it 
uals board is under pressure from the investor group coniston 
partners which owns 118 percent of uals stock to sell or 
otherwise restructure the company to boost share prices 
keith gollust a general partner in coniston declined comment 
tuesday on whether the new yorkbased partnership would support the 
reported buyout plan 
coniston has threatened to launch a drive for shareholder 
consent to dump 13 of uals 15 directors and create a fivemember 
board

approval of a corporate restructuring 
plan by ramada inc shareholders has cleared the way for the sale 
of ramadas 825 hotels and formation of a new company to operate 
its nevada and new jersey casinos 
the restructurng plan was approved tuesday at a special 
shareholders meeting in scottsdale under the plan ramada would 
sell its international hotel business to new world hotel holdings 
ltd of hong kong for 540 million 
a new company aztar corp would be formed at the same time to 
operate ramadas three casinos 
the transaction was approved by the nevada and new jersey gaming 
commissions tuesday 
assuming that everything goes as scheduled we will close the 
entire transaction next week said richard snell ramadas 
chairman and chief executive officer after the meeting 
more than 96 percent of the 30 million shares that were voted 
approved the plan under which each shareholder would receive 1 in 
cash and one share of aztar stock for each share of ramada stock 
ramadas original restructuring plan which the company scrapped 
in october included an offering of 400 million in debt 
securities including 230 million in subordinated debt or junk 
bonds to finance the new company 
under that plan shareholders would have received approximately 
7 plus one share of aztar stock for each share of ramada stock 
the company announced in october that it would not go forward 
with that plan because of unfavorable conditions in the 
junkbond market which has been depressed and unstable for months 
the new plan includes a 170 million offering of debt securities 
and eliminates the junkbond offering under the plan each 
shareholder would receive 1 in cash plus one share of aztar stock 
for each share of ramada stock 
ramada spokesman joe cole said that under the new plan ramada 
would assume 230 million less in new debt but would pay out 240 
million less to its stockholders 
it will be a less leveraged stronger company cole said 
fewer than 200 employees will lose their jobs once the 
transaction is completed snell said 
the main reduction is in the hotel group he said

the dollar fell today against all major foreign 
currencies in nervous european trading dealers said 
gold prices were mixed 
dealers said they were flabbergasted by the dollars tumble 
which went beyond all expectations and has left most yearend 
trading strategies in shambles 
there is a big uncertainty people didnt expect that said 
a dealer at a munich bank the question is now whether there is 
any interest by the central bank to support the dollar

early today 
the market was waiting for todays release of november us 
retail sales figures traders said 
even if the sales figures were better than their modest 
expectations dealers said bearish sentiment on the dollar was 
likely to persist at least until the end of the year

the tokyo stock exchanges key index closed above

against the japanese yen for the second consecutive day 
the 225issue nikkei stock average shot up 25889 points or 
068 percent ending the day at 3806242 a new high 
it took only 16 trading days for the index to gain more than 
2000 points it first climbed above 36000 points on nov 21 
the nikkei indexs gain today was prompted by rises in the

securities co 
he said the nikkei also rose on indexbuying or purchases of at 
least 1000 shares in all of the nikkeis 225 items transactions 
that cost billions of dollars 
favorable economic factors such as the yens recent recovery 
against the dollar and gains on overseas stock markets reassured

chrysler corp will rely on a strippeddown 
version of a compact car to fill a void left when the company stops 
making subcompacts a chrysler executive said 
the nations no 3 automaker will stop building its dodge omni 
and plymouth horizon subcompacts when it shuts down its jefferson 
avenue assembly plant in detroit early in february 
youll see that lowend replaced by a valueoriented pcar 
chrysler marketing vice president john damoose said tuesday 
the pcar is the dodge shadow and plymouth sundance built at the 
companys sterling heights assembly plant 
damoose said the subcompact replacement probably wouldnt go 
into production until after cars derived from the lh and lx 
platforms are introduced scheduled for the fall of 1992 
according to wards automotive reports a weekly industry 
newsletter subcompact cars made up 131 percent of the total us 
car market the omni and horizon the only subcompacts built by 
chrysler comprised 8 percent of the automakers car sales of about 
959128 through nov 30 
damoose spoke to reporters as he outlined chryslers plans for 
the north american international auto show in detroit next month 
at that event chrysler will show off its new dodge stealth sports 
car which goes on sale in october the new dodge monaco being 
built in canada a lebaron sedan and a new jeep 
damoose said chrysler planned to build 25000 to 30000 stealth 
cars to compete in the same market as the mazda rx7 and the nissan 
300zx no price for the car has been set 
also the company will have on hand six concept vehicles which 
are used to show off design and engineering developments but arent 
necessarily headed for assembly lines 
on other matters damoose said 
chrysler is studying the effect of plymouth advertising 
featuring entertainer tina turner which was introduced earlier 
this year he said the research should be completed next month 
he said he didnt know if the advertising had helped sell 
plymouth cars 
nobody has ever talked about plymouth advertising in their 
lives now they are he said so far this model year plymouth 
dealers have sold 75426 cars and minivans down 47 percent from 
the same time last year 
chrysler production planners are forecasting that the company 
will hold its 138 percent share of the us car and light truck 
market in 1990 that will come as sales for the entire industry 
tumble to about 142 million vehicles 
chryslers 1990 sales estimate is the lowest of the big three 
general motors corp officials predict that about 15 million 
vehicles will be sold next year and ford motor co executives put 
the volume at about 147 million slightly lower than sales this 
year 
our strategy is to hold share and do it profitably damoose 
said whether its going to take any more incentives is anybodys 
guess

no clear winner was declared in the battle between 
two companies over rights to an anemia treatment drug but a 
federal magistrates murky ruling offered a potential boost to the 
biotech industry analysts said 
consumers could ultimately come out the winners under the 
federal ruling because the two companies could reach a 
crosslicensing agreement that would ensure a stable and perhaps 
cheaper supply of the drug analysts said tuesday 
the case began two years ago when amgen inc sued genetics 
institute inc for allegedly infringing on the biotech companys 
patent covering the production of erythropoietin or epo 
genetics institute countersued claiming it held the rights to 
the protein itself which stimulates the production of red blood 
cells and is often used to treat kidney disease 
us magistrate patti b saris issued a 184page ruling monday 
in which she found both patents to be mostly valid meaning that 
each company had infringed on the others patent rights 
the greatest likely impact is greatly enhanced chances for 
negotiations leading to a settlement which would involve 
crosslicensing for both parties said david webber a biotech 
stock analyst with alex brown amp sons in new york 
both parties may file an appeal in the case but analysts said 
the protracted battle would likely end in a compromise that would 
allow amgen which has already secured food and drug administration 
approval to continue marketing epo in the united states 
for gi crosslicensing would mean the company could use the 
amgenpatented process to manufacture epo domestically where the 
estimated potential market for the drug is at least 200 million 
webber said mondays ruling left a plethora of potential legal 
outcomes but there is increased incentive for amgen to negotiate 
on an evenhanded basis with gi because theres an increased chance 
that amgen could lose its right to market epo in the united 
states 
lawyers for both companies said they had not yet decided what 
their next step would be but none ruled out the possibility of a 
compromise 
in my mind its somewhat of a commonsense type of thing 
said eugene moroz whose firm represents gis japanese partner 
chugai pharmaceutical co but thats assuming you can get two 
fighting parties together after a long battle 
mark brand a spokesman for amgen said only that the company 
was examining all the options and would not rush a decision on 
whether to appeal the ruling 
genetics institute was awarded a patent for the substance epo in 
june 1987 but the scientist who purified the epo described in the 
patent application used conventional chemistry to create it 
amgen got a patent the following october for identifying the ep 
gene and for creating genetically engineered cells that contain and 
produce it 
in effect the only commercially viable way to produce genetics 
institutes patented epo is by using amgens patented process 
what we have here is two patents and two infringers said 
linda miller an analyst with painewebber group inc in boston 
its sort of a pingpong match going back and forth and back and 
forth 
gary hatton editor of biotech stock letter in waltham mass 
said crosslicensing could benefit consumers by bringing both 
companies into the market thus stabilizing sources of the supply 
and also potentially undercutting prices 
because chugai is behind in the actual marketing of the drug 
they may come in at sort of a price discount so you get some 
competition he said 
webber said the ruling was also significant in that it upheld 
patents in the relatively untried biotechnology field 
its one of the first federal court rulings regarding 
geneticallyengineered proteins used as therapeutic drugs he 
said theres been a lot of uncertainty where ownership as 
indicated by patents would end up in this field 
hatton agreed 
its a tremendously important suit for the biotech 
industry because before any venture capitalist puts money into the 
industry he has to believe these products are going to get 
patents he said it reduces a huge uncertainty and the effect 
is an increased stability

a 5 million plant to recycle plastics now 
mostly buried in landfills will open here in the spring in a joint 
venture between du pont co and waste management of north america 
inc 
known as the plastic recycling alliance the 5050 venture would 
demonstrate first the companies commitment to recycling and 
second that household plastics collected at curbside can have a 
new life officials of the two firms said tuesday 
they said they plan to build the concept into an environmentally 
safe nationwide trash disposal network 
nicholas pappas du pont executive vice president and waste 
management president william hulligan said the 70employee plant is 
the first that completes the recycling loop from picking up trash 
to turning it into new products like baseball gloves park benches 
and home siding 
our plant is a very clean process pappas said it doesnt 
affect the environment at all 
other firms operate similar plastic recovery plants notably in 
south carolina and new jersey but none is involved in trash 
collection 
if the plant succeeds as expected handling up to 40 million 
pounds of residentialgenerated plastic annually the first few 
years another facility will open later next year in the midwest 
at a site to be selected 
future recycling facilities will be located in areas where the 
joint venture can purchase materials from curbside and deposit 
return programs throughout the united states pappas said noting 
that waste management is the largest collector of trash in the 
world while du pont is one of the largest plastic makers 
the two executives said the joint venture will have a total 
capacity of 200 million pounds from various trash sources by 1994 
du pont is headquartered in wilmington del and waste 
management has its base in oak brook ill 
pappas envisioned a minimum of three plants if enough new 
product is produced in what he called an infant industry the 
venture might sell to other companies besides du pont which has 
been recycling industrial plastics for about a decade 
after the plastic materials are delivered the venture sorts 
cleans and reduces them to plastic flake a usable raw material for 
processing by du pont pappas said 
du ponts requirement for raw materials for use in attractive 
new products assures the joint venture of a market and it assures 
du pont of a steady and reliable source of feedstock hulligan 
said 
mayor w wilson goode praising the site selection said 
philadelphia today spends almost 65 million for solid waste 
disposal a sound trash recycling program for which there is a 
market can save the city money he said

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade shrank to 2269 billion in the julyseptember quarter 
giving the country its lowest trade imbalance since early 1984 the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said the current account deficit dropped 
a dramatic 29 percent from a secondquarter deficit of 3208 
billion as the category covering income on us investments abroard 
surged upward 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but trade in services the latter category 
includes the income americans earn on their overseas investments 
and the income foreigners earn on their investments in the united 
states 
for the third quarter the services category registered a 
surplus of 872 billion reflecting a decline in the value of the 
dollar during the period a weaker dollar means that the profits 
us companies earn in foreign currencies are worth more when they 
are translated back into dollars 
a rising dollar during the apriljune quarter was blamed for 
depressing investment earnings in the second quarter when the 
country registered a 166 billion deficit in the services 
category that was the first services deficit in 30 years 
private economists however cautioned that the big swing of the 
services category back into surplus was likely to be only 
temporary many analysts forecast that the services category will 
be in deficit throughout the 1990s reflecting the fact that the 
united states is now the worlds largest debtor nation 
simply put that means that foreigners now own more in us 
assets than americans own overseas americas net debtor position 
stood at 5325 billion at the end of last year and is expected to 
worsen by an additional 100 billion this year 
many economists are predicting that us living standards will 
begin to decline because financing the growing foreign debt burden 
will mean that less money will be available for productive 
investment in this country 
through the first nine months of this year the current account 
deficit was running at an annual rate of 11355 billion down 
modestly from the 12655 billion deficit recorded in 1988 
the 2269 billion deficit in the third quarter was the lowest 
since a 209 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1984 
it occurred even though the merchandise deficit rose a slight 
07 percent during the quarter to 2775 billion up from 2755 
billion in the second quarter 
in addition to merchandise and services the third segment of 
the current account deficit us foreign aid payments and pensions 
to americans living overseas rose in the third quarter to 366 
billion up from 287 billion in the second quarter 
the current account reflects the sum of the deficits or 
surpluses in the merchandise services and foreign aid and pensions 
categories 
at the start of this decade the united states was running 
surpluses in its current account because earnings from american 
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in 
merchandise trade 
but as americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign 
hands to pay for imported cars and televisions the investment 
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985 when the 
united states became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years

a recent meeting between eastern airlines and 
its striking machinists union has prompted a federal bankruptcy 
judge to postpone until jan 26 consideration of contempt charges 
against union leaders 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland on tuesday granted the 
unions request that the hearing be deferred the potential 
contempt charges stem from a disturbance nov 26 between pickets 
and working employees at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
sheldon engelhard an attorney representing the machinists said 
the hearing should be put off because of recent negotiations 
between union leaders and management 
charles e bryan president of machinists district 100 told the 
associated press last week that he met in washington on nov 30 
with eastern vice presidents tom matthews and al gibson the 
threehour meeting was led by federal mediator harry bickford 
eastern spokesman robin matell said it was the first such 
meeting since an informal session oct 13 and he and bryan said 
both sides agreed to more meetings bryan said all parties agreed 
not to describe or give details of the sessions 
in a separate development tuesday eastern and a committee 
representing major creditors agreed to postpone until sometime next 
week a meeting that had been planned for wednesday matell said 
eastern reportedly is close to selling its latin american routes 
to amr corp parent of american airlines for 300 million to 400 
million there has been speculation that a deal would be announced 
at the meeting with creditors 
miamibased eastern has been operating as a smaller airline with 
replacement workers since march 4 when the machinists struck and 
pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy eastern filed 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on march 9 the carrier is 
expected to submit a revised plan of reorganization at next weeks 
session with creditors 
the machinists continue to walk picket lines but the pilots and 
flight attendants called off their sympathy strikes shortly before 
thanksgiving 
seven striking machinists were arrested nov 26 on charges of 
unlawful assembly when they refused to leave the atlanta airport 
after a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured a 
working eastern employee 
at that time lifland issued a showcause order citing willful 
defiance of a july 17 temporary restraining order prohibiting the 
atlanta pickets from threatening or injuring eastern workers 
the machinists cited in the order could face fines and court 
costs if found in contempt they include bryan and robert taylor 
and charles pecca machinist officials based in atlanta

british airways plc and klm royal dutch airlines 
each plan to buy a 20 percent stake in a newly formed sabena world 
airways for a combined total of 110 million the british airline 
announced wednesday 
the other 60 percent of the new airline will be held by parent 
company sabena sa which is controlled by the belgian government 
british airways said 
the new airline formed after nearly six months of negotiations 
is scheduled to start operations at the beginning of next year 
extending sabenas present route network with a hub and spoke 
system centered on brussels zaventem airport british airways said 
british airways stake cost 34 million pounds the equivalent of 
55 million while klm confirmed that its stake cost 107 million 
dutch guilders also equal to about 55 million 
the british carrier said the new sabena airline is expected to 
exploit opportunities emerging from the progressive liberalization 
of european air transportation 
this will include intercontinental routes such as linking 
brussels with manchester in britain for some services to north 
america and the far east and linking brussels with amsterdam for 
some services to africa and south america it said 
in terms of revenue passenger kilometers the new company is 
expected to treble sabenas current size in six years british 
airways said 
last year sabena reported 12 billion revenue passenger 
kilometers ranking it 16th among european airlines according to 
the association of european airlines 
british airways ranked first and klm ninth by that measure 
which is the number of kilometers airlines fly farepaying 
passengers 
the board of sabena world will have 10 members with six coming 
from sabena and two from each british airways and klm sabenas 
chairman will be carlos van rafelghem who is currently chairman 
and chief executive of sabena sa 
european airlines have been scrambling to buy into other 
airlines and form joint ventures to become better competitors in 
the face of increasing deregulation and globalization of the travel 
industry 
british airways attempted to buy a 15 percent stake in united 
airlines of the united states earlier this year but abandoned the 
effort after the management bidding group encountered difficulties 
lining up the financing 
this forging of ties has raised concern in some quarters that 
europes airlines eventually will be concentrated into two or three 
blocks which could hurt competition and ultimately the consumer 
a spokesman for the european community commission who requested 
anonymity said the governing body of the 12member common market 
would examine the new venture agreement to see whether it is 
anticompetitive 
the commission ordered british airways to change terms of its 
acquisition of its smaller rival british caledonian airways two 
years ago 
british airways said about the latest deal the three airline 
partners will remain autonomous and continue to compete 
commercially 
it said it already competes directly with sabena on two routes 
london to brussels and amsterdam and that the competition will 
intensify

more than a dozen reports of problems with rudder 
trim controls on boeing 737s have been made since a plane skidded 
off a new york runway in september two federal agencies 
investigating the accident said 
the federal aviation administration and the national 
transportation safety board said tuesday they have asked boeing co 
to provide data on any reports it has received on rudders set in 
unexpected positions on its 737300 and 737400 model jets 
boeing spokesman dick schleh said the jet manufacturer is 
compiling the data 
schleh said it is not clear whether the federal request is 
connected with the new york incident this is just part of the 
information the ntsb accumulates in the normal course of an 
investigation like this he said 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz in washington dc said the 
agency has received at least a dozen reports including two 
involving foreign airlines of instances where the crew says it 
discovered the rudder was trimmed in a way that they didnt 
expect 
the board began receiving the reports after its investigators 
found that the rudder was improperly set on usair flight 5050 as it 
tried to take off from new yorks laguardia airport on sept 20 
two passengers were killed and 45 injured when the 737400 
veered during takeoff and skidded into the east river breaking 
into three pieces 
the board will decide later this week whether it will hold 
public hearings on the accident lopatkiewicz said 
faa spokesman david duff in seattle said his agency has launched 
its own investigation after receiving several reports of rudder 
trim problems 
the faa expects to receive further information from boeing next 
week and then will decide whether to order any action such as a 
design change or modification duff said 
the inquiries are limited to the 737300 and 737400 models 
because they have electrically driven trim activators earlier

the cause was related to human factors or a mechanical problem or a 
combination of both duff said 
the investigations will include whether a crew member

the season is in full swing when charitable 
organizations form a sort of joint venture with santa claus and 
uncle sam filling mail boxes telephone lines and shopping malls 
with requests for contributions 
the fund raisers expect results from those extra efforts because 
they carry a doubleedged appeal the emotional spirit of the 
holidays and the pragmatic allure of a lastminute tax deduction 
some people object to this merger of generous and selfish 
motives but from a practical standpoint financial advisers say a 
knowledge of the tax rules can make a big difference in how 
effectively you devote your limited resources to religious or 
community service groups private education or any other cause you 
consider worthy 
first of all the experts point out you cant take any writeoff 
these days for charitable contributions unless you itemize 
deductions 
thats important to consider because the standard deduction has 
been sharply increased in the last few years for 1989 it is 
3100 for a single taxpayer and 5200 for a married couple filing 
a joint return 
contributions wont provide you with any extra tax saving if 
they and your other deductions such as mortgage interest dont 
add up to more than those amounts 
tax specialists advise people on the borderline to consider 
bunching deductible expenses such as contributions into alternate 
years and itemizing only in those years 
there are strict rules as well covering just what contributions 
are deductible money given to a recognized church or charity for 
instance is almost surely eligible for a writeoff country club 
dues almost surely not 
an organization can and undoubtedly will tell you whether 
your contribution to it is tax deductible says the accounting 
firm of price waterhouse in its annual personal tax advisor 
gifts to individuals or designated for an individuals use are 
excluded by the rules also excluded are contributions to business 
or civic leagues and political parties or candidates 
on the other hand an eligible cash contribution is deductible 
in the year in which it is made even if you use borrowed money 
that means that you can give by credit card in december pay the 
creditcard bill later and still take a deduction for 1989 
many organizations also readily accept noncash gifts such as 
old and outgrown clothing or furniture 
specific records must be kept to support a deduction for 
donated property observe accountants deloitte amp touche once the 
amount you claim in this category surpasses 500 in any year the 
documentation requirements grow increasingly stringent 
some special incentives exist to donate stocks or other 
securities that you have owned for more than a year and have 
appreciated in value since you bought them 
under most circumstances you can take a deduction for the 
present value of such a contribution and avoid paying taxes on 
the capital gain that occurred while you owned the asset in 
question 
much different advice applies in the case of securities that are 
worth less now than when you bought them since giving them 
directly involves passing up a deductible tax loss 
such property should not be contributed to a charity says 
deloitte amp touche it should be sold to realize the loss and the 
proceeds of the sale should be contributed to charity

northeast utilities made major gains today 
in its bid to buy public service company of new hampshire the 
first big investorowned utility to go bankrupt since the 
depression 
state senate president william bartlett whose support was seen 
as key to northeasts success in a special legislative session 
scheduled for thursday now will support the 23 billion buyout 
and public service which had held out hope of winning the 
right to reorganize itself threw in the towel 
house speaker douglas scamman announced at a news conference 
that republican leaders in both houses had united behind the 
northeast plan after winning agreements intended to protect 
consumers and other new hampshire utilities 
were very confident they have protection and future power 
supply based on the agreements scamman said the changes will 
be amendments to the northeast takeover bill scheduled for a vote 
thursday 
despite the developments the vote still is too close to call 
the no 2 republican in the senate said 
i wont make any prediction majority leader edward dupont 
said he said he hadnt decided how he would vote 
democrats heavily outnumbered in the legislature continued to 
oppose the northeast plan 
we have come to no agreement house democratic leader mary 
chambers said this morning 
connecticutbased northeast proposes seven annual rate increases 
of 55 percent the first taking effect jan 1 northeast says the 
plan is seabrook neutral meaning it would not change 
regardless of whether public services seabrook nuclear power plant 
operates 
the 63 billion plant which plunged public service into 
bankruptcy reorganization in january 1988 is idle for lack of a 
federal operating license the nuclear regulatory commission could 
issue a license as early as january but appeals in federal courts 
are certain 
public service new hampshires largest electric utility had 
been viewed recently as a distant second in the takeover 
competition at a morning news conference john duffett president 
and board chairman attributed the utilitys decision to drop out 
of the competition mainly to political opposition and public 
services inability to win support from key creditor groups 
northeast far and away the leading contender before today had 
been seen as having little chance of winning legislative backing 
without support from bartlett as late as tuesday night bartlett 
continued negotiating for further concessions from northeast 
legislative democrats and some republicans say the northeast 
plan would be a windfall for investors without protecting consumers 
republican gov judd gregg and other supporters of the agreement 
say the plan is far from ideal but is the best that could be 
achieved under difficult circumstances and has the important 
benefit of avoiding years of legal wrangling and uncertaintly about 
rates 
gregg whose office had no comment this morning charged tuesday 
that the democrats real agenda in opposing northeast is stopping 
seabrook 
democrats are espousing the old agenda of lets kill seabrook 
at any cost even if the cost is that new hampshire consumers end 
up paying a lot more for energy and may not have the available 
supply they need in the future gregg said 
chambers denied it 
the seabrook issue is really a minor issue in all of this 
she said tuesday this plan gives absolutely no protection to 
consumers and permits the company to make incredible profits 
republicans outnumber democrats 31 in the house and 21 in the 
senate but chambers said tuesday she doubted that republicans had 
sufficient votes to pass the northeast plan gregg disagreed 
predicting the plan would pass 
even if the legislature passes the northeast plan it would need 
approval by us bankruptcy judge james yacos and various 
government agencies 
any changes to the plan presumably would require the approval of 
public service creditors whose representatives had accepted the 
northeast plan as it stood before today

blue arrow plc the worlds largest employment 
services company said wednesday it is taking steps to change its 
name to manpower plc adopting the identity of the giant american 
agency it acquired in 1987 
the companys board of directors on tuesday voted unanimously to 
recommend the change to shareholders it said 
blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein former head of manpower 
obtained control of blue arrow management in a boardroom coup 
earlier this year 
since manpower inc represents over 75 percent of the 
companys revenues and profits and is the multinational brand 
among the companys holdings it is appropriate to make this 
change fromstein said it should surprise no one 
the smaller blue arrow bought manpower based in milwaukee 
wis in an acrimonious 134 billion takeover battle two years ago 
in january fromstein emerged as blue arrows chief executive 
after a fight among the companys directors and major us 
franchisees over the management practices of antony berry then 
chairman and chief executive 
fromstein was named to replace berry as chairman in april 
blue arrow has suffered a series of financial embarrassments 
since the manpower takeover including the disclosure of a 
questionable loan to a berry associate and the coverup by its 
financial advisers of the failure of an 837 millionpound stock 
sale used to fund the takeover

airlines worldwide have tightened security since 
the pan am jumbo jet terrorist explosion over lockerbie scotland 
spending large amounts of money on defenses that range from 
bombsniffing dogs to baggage xray gear 
but two more big passenger planes have crashed in the year since 
then in presumed terrorist sabotage and experts warn that another 
lockerbie could happen tomorrow 
the flight 103 bombing that killed 259 people in midair dec 21 
1988 has made terrorism a sobering and expensive fact of life for 
the airlines especially the big us carriers that fly overseas 
sophisticated bombs timed to explode during flight have replaced 
hijacking as terrorists favored mode of operation 
the burly guards body searches bomb detectors and dogs trained 
to smell hidden explosives have become increasingly familiar 
staples of air travel helping to drive ticket prices higher 
the federal aviation administration sent a key directive to us 
airlines a month after the lockerbie crash requiring specific 
measures for inspecting baggage and screening passengers for 
example the faa has ordered installation of sophisticated 
explosivedetection gear in 40 airports by next october 
the aviation industry has taken steps to ensure better 
controls said don w walker president of business risks 
international a consulting firm but he said terrorism is 
escalating worldwide the terrorists are generally one step ahead 
of what airlines are able to do 
in july 1988 the airlines intensified antiterrorist defenses 
in response to the navys downing of an iran air jetliner but 
terrorists sneaked a sophisticated explosive through pan ams 
security system six months later 
after the pan am bombing the airlines again strengthened 
security then last september a uta french airline dc10 exploded 
over niger africa in a suspected bombing that killed 174 people 
including seven americans 
in november an avianca airlines boeing 727 crashed near bogota 
colombia in what authorities called a suspected bombing by drug 
traffickers retaliating for a government crackdown 
airlines once declined to discuss security but in the aftermath 
of the lockerbie disaster the airline industry has started making 
security a subtle part of its marketing campaign to attract and 
reassure passengers 
for example extensive publicity has been given to the socalled 
thermal neutron analysis explosive detectors that the faa has 
required pan am and trans world airlines have been the first to 
install the new devices 
the company that makes them science applications international 
corp said they will be an important working model for other 
airlines to learn from as the faa security program goes forward 
still most carriers still wont talk specifically about how 
much money they spend although it is in the millions of dollars 
they also criticize the government for not absorbing more of the 
cost 
the airline industry is the surrogate target for the 
government said homer boynton director of security for american 
airlines the largest us carrier the government ought to give 
us more help and more assistance 
but fred farrar a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration called security a cost of doing business 
traditionally the airlines have paid the cost of equipment needed 
for security reasons 
like jet fuel and passenger food airline security is an expense 
that comes out of revenues or as a special surcharge added to 
ticket prices that passes the bill to travelers pan am for 
example adds 5 to the cost of a oneway transatlantic ticket 
boynton said american is the only major us airline that uses 
its own employees for all security work most big carriers have 
their own security divisions but also contract with outside 
companies for passenger screening in airports and other protective 
services 
american which operates a growing number of flights to europe 
spends 11 million to 12 million a year on security boynton said 
its program is partly modeled on that of israels el al 
airlines which has a reputation for the toughest security measures 
spokesmen for american pan am trans world airlines eastern 
airlines british airways and japan air lines queried by the 
associated press all said their carriers strengthened what they 
called alreadytight security after lockerbie representatives of 
uta and avianca said those airlines stepped up security after 
disaster struck them 
while financially strong airlines such as american can afford 
topquality security as well as newer safer jets there is concern 
that weaker carriers could be tempted to cut corners 
pan am for example lost 1583 million for the first nine 
months of this year compared with a loss of 21 million in the 
same period in 1988 in every financial quarter since lockerbie 
pan am has largely blamed its poor financial condition on falling 
transatlantic passenger traffic resulting from the crash in a 
recent abc news special broadcast some former security employees 
of pan am alleged serious deficiencies in the airlines screening 
system according to abc the pan am security supervisor in 
frankfurt west germany where flight 103 originated had a criminal 
record unknown to the airline 
the former employees charged that pan ams security was 
compromised by costcutting and concern about ontime performance 
because it has been sued by a number of relatives of lockerbie 
crash victims pan am cannot respond specifically to the 
allegations about its alert security co said pan am spokesman 
jeff kriendler he called the charges false and misleading and 
a vindictive effort to discredit a former employer 
we strongly reject any suggestion that pan am or alert would 
have deliberately compromised the safety of passengers and crew 
members to effect ontime departure or to cut costs kriendler 
said 
last august president bush created the presidential commission 
on aviation security and terrorism scheduled to make 
recommendations to him next spring the sevenmember panel headed 
by former labor secretary ann mclaughlin plans to evaluate 
aviation security the handling of terrorist threats against air 
travel and whether the public should be told of them and the 
governments treatment of terrorists victims 
at its first hearing on nov 17 former faa security director 
billie h vincent told the panel that air security is seriously 
deficient in highthreat areas such as europe and the middle east 
other experts agree 
we are way behind in taking the necessary measures that will 
help to prevent this kind of tragedy happening again terrorism 
expert paul wilkinson recently told a news conference in london 
another lockerbie could happen tomorrow

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade in lightvolume 
buying linked largely to weather concerns 
bitter cold temperatures in the nations midsection are stirring 
fears of damage to the winter wheat crop in the great plains and 
spurring demand for soybean meal among cattle producrs 
when the weather gets cold they have to increase the energy 
component in the feed mix so they feed the cattle more meal 
said joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in 
chicago 
the soybean market was further supported by fears that the 
continuing dry weather in southern brazil the worlds 
secondlargest soybean producer would stretch into a drought 
the corn market rallied slightly on commercial buying possibly 
indicating that new export sales are in the works karlin said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 414 a bushel corn 
futures were unchanged to 2 cents higher with december at 233 a

imagine a stack of 100000 
doublespaced typewritten pages enough paper to make a stack 33 
feet tall shrunk to one square inch 
international business machines corp claimed wednesday to have 
achieved that condensing job by storing for the first time a 
billion bits of information on a square inch of magnetic material 
the record data density is 15 to 30 times greater than that of 
current magnetic hard disks which are used for storing data ibm 
said 
it will be several years though before billionbit or 
gigabit disks will be available commercially ibm said 
ibm invented the first commercial magnetic hard disk drives in 
the mid1950s and they have since become the most popular devices 
for storing computer data 
in the gigabit demonstration at ibms almaden research center in 
san jose an aluminum disk was coated with a thin film of a 
magnetic cobalt alloy which held the recorded bits 
experimental equipment recorded and read at a data rate of 35 
million bytes per second the measured error rates were 
sufficiently low one in a billion decreasing to one in 10 
trillion when error correction codes were used to meet the 
requirements of the computer industry 
that latter accuracy level ibm said was the equivalent of 
transcribing more than 10000 years of a newspaper before making a 
mistake

dropped its debt ratings for chrysler corp and its financial 
subsidiary by one notch amid concern over vehicle sales 
competition and capital expenditures 
fitch investors service inc said it was reviewing chryslers 
securities and standard amp poors corp said no change was likely 
movement in security ratings indicate increasing or decreasing 
faith in the creditworthiness of a company 
moodys said in a news release that it was lowering a variety of 
chrysler securities because of concerns that chryslers operating 
performance will remain under pressure over the intermediate 
term or three to four years

baa2 from baa1 moodys analyst carol verschell said that 
was toward the lower end of the companys investmentgrade ratings

will come under increasing competitive pressure 
chryslers announcement earlier this month to sell chrysler 
technologies corp which includes gulfstream aerospace inc will 
provide some cash verschell said but the timing of the sale and 
the amount are uncertain

slightly higher than moodys new ratings all chrysler ratings were 
under review she said 
there will be some action but i dont know when it will 
come sudol said

bbb rating of chrysler securities roughly the same level as 
moodys we dont expect to have any kind of rating change she 
said 
verschell said moodys was not reviewing the ratings of general 
motors corp or ford motor co securities 
moodys announcement of lower chryslers ratings came before the 
company reported that sales of its north americanmade cars and 
trucks fell 251 percent in early december compared with the same 
time last year

computer disks purporting to give information 
about aids have damaged computers at british banks hospitals 
universities and commercial institutions police said wednesday 
the fraud squad at scotland yard police headquarters said an 
unspecified destructive mechanism had been found in the disks 
which had rendered computers unusable in 10 cases 
the squad said it had reports of the floppy disks being received 
by mail in different parts of the country from london to edinburgh 
in scotland there were no confirmed reports of the disk being 
received outside britain 
the squad said it was investigating criminal damage caused by 
the disks to computers at banks hospitals universities and 
commercial institutions the recipients were not identified 
two disks turned up wednesday in the mail at the london stock 
exchange and others were sent to the australia and new zealand 
bank the city of london police said 
the city police responsible for the financial district warned 
companies to be on their guard 
these disks must on no account be placed in computers they 
are obviously meant to interfere with systems city police 
headquarters said 
city police said the disks apparently contained information 
about the disease aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
an accompanying letter asked for a license fee of either 
189 or 378 depending on the type of license to be sent to an 
address in panama but the envelope was mailed in londons south 
kensington district city police said 
the letter warned in small print that if the money was not paid 
the sender would use program mechanisms to stop a computer 
functioning normally city police said 
computer companies said they believed addresses for receiving 
the disks had been obtained from pc business world a british 
weekly trade paper devoted to computing 
joe hirst an expert on computer sabotage told the associated 
press the rogue disk was not of the virus type which spoils 
computer systems by duplicating itself but a trojan which does 
direct damage 
the name comes from the ancient greek wooden horse concealing 
soldiers who came out at night to destroy the city of troy 
there are two programs on the disk said hirst former 
technical editor of virus bulletin and a consultant on computer 
software 
the first is an installation program and the second is a 
questionnaire on the risk of aids which will not run unless it is 
installed on a hard disk it then prints off an invoice for a 
company in panama but the damage has already been done by the 
installation he said 
hirst said he suspected the intention of the sender was entirely 
malicious 
money does not appear to be the motivation he said 
it may be difficult to understand but there are people out 
there who get a kick out of showing how clever they are they may 
have a grudge against the world they enjoy the idea of doing 
serious damage to people they dont know like those who put glass 
in baby food he said 
the alarm was first raised on tuesday by dr alan solomon 
chairman of a group of users of personal computers who said he 
received a similar disk the previous day 
if you have not installed it then dont it seems to be some 
kind of sabotage solomon said 
at the stock exchange an official speaking anonymously said 
you must be off your head if you get an unsolicited disk and put 
it in your machine 
the official said the disks would never have been put into the 
market trading system if someone wanted to find out what was on 
them he said they would have used an internal system for 
transmitting office memos

the stock market settled for some scattered 
gains today after an early advance stalled 
analysts said traders drew some encouragement from the commerce 
department report that retail sales rose 08 percent in november 
exceeding most private estimates 
that eased some worries on wall street that slackening consumer 
spending might be increasing the chances of a recession in the near 
future 
but interest rates rose a bit following the news and investors 
still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the economy in 
1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might remain weak 
brokers also noted that the market bogged down after the dow 
jones industrial average moved within striking distance of the 
record closing high of 279141 it reached on oct 9 before it 
took a 190point drop four days later

a federal jury on wednesday convicted gaf corp 
and a top executive of manipulating the price of a companys stock 
as the government won another victory in its crackdown on wall 
street fraud 
after two previous mistrials the jury in us district court 
found gaf and vice chairman james t sherwin guilty on all eight 
counts of stock manipulation securities fraud wire fraud and 
conspiracy two gaf subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges 
sherwin 56 of princeton nj faces up to 40 years in prison 
and 2 million in fines when sentenced march 9 by judge mary 
johnson lowe gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building 
materials manufacturer could be fined a total of up to 4 million 
sherwins attorney stephen kaufman said he would appeal the 
conviction 
gaf said in a statement we will leave no stone unturned in 
pursuing every avenue of appeal we continue to have complete 
confidence in jim sherwin who will continue in his postions as 
vice chairman and chief administrative officer 
gaf two subsidiaries and sherwin were indicted in july 1988 for 
allegedly trying to boost the stock price of union carbide corp in 
1986 shortly before selling a large block of carbide shares 
when the case was first presented to a jury a year ago it 
attracted wide attention as the first criminal trial stemming from 
the insider trading scandals of the mid1980s 
since then several other cases have resulted in jury 
convictions including the princetonnewport partners racketeering 
and fraud case and the stock manipulation trial of florida investor 
paul a bilzerian 
the first gaf trial ended in mistrial last january when lowe 
determined prosecutors unintentionally withheld a piece of 
evidence a second mistrial was declared in march when the jury 
deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations 
justice is finally done said assistant us attorney carl 
h loewenson jr 
after the verdict an ashenfaced sherwin embraced his wife and 
daughters im terribly disappointed and im innocent of these 
charges he said to reporters 
the subsidiaries found innocent of the charges were jay amp 
company inc and gaf chemicals corp 
the governments case against gaf was based largely on the 
testimony of los angeles broker boyd l jefferies an admitted 
felon who has payed a key role in other securities fraud cases as 
part of a plea agreement with the government 
jefferies testified that sherwin asked him in october 1986 to 
boost union carbides price to 22 a share and agreed to pay 
40000 to cover losses in the deal 
a higher stock price would have meant more money for gaf which 
had accumulated 10 million shares of union carbide during a failed 
takeover bid in 1986 gaf sold five million shares to salomon 
brothers inc for 23 each on nov 10 
after a sixweek trial the jury returned its verdict after 
about eight hours of deliberations compared with some 93 hours in 
the second mistrial 
the verdict also came despite the introduction of new evidence 
in the trials last week that apparently contradicted key testimony 
by jefferies and a trading asistant at his firm 
defense attorneys introduced telephone records indicating that 
no calls were placed on longdistance wats lines from the jefferies 
amp co brokerage to gaf or sherwin during times in october 1986 when 
the government alleged the manipulation was discussed 
defense lawyers had branded jefferies as a crook who had schemed 
illegally with jailed stock speculator ivan boesky who paid 100 
million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986 
boesky fingered jefferies who last year agreed to plead guilty 
to two securities law violations jefferies earlier this year was 
sentenced to five years probation and a 250000 fine

a visit to a laura ashley store with its dark 
green front and blackberry sprig motif woodsy interior and 
heathery scents conjures up images of the cozy privileged gentry 
of england 
you expect to bump into young upper class english roses 
with cultivated accents and gorgeous complexions who attend 
society balls drive range rovers and adore their terriers 
but behind the scenes times are tough for laura ashley holdings 
plc the british retailer famous for popularizing the frilly 
clothes and home furnishings of the english countryside 
business is suffering because of a slowdown in british and us 
retail sales high interest rates in britain and the weak dollar 
which makes british goods more expensive for american buyers 
laura ashley as responded by entering the male market and 
updating its designs retailing industry analysts believe the 
company will survive the crisis and prosper 
profits have been disappointing for the past three years 
repeatedly undershooting estimates and leaving the public holding 
shares worth nearly half the price they fetched when laura ashley 
went public four years ago 
the company recently announced it would cut 100 jobs the first 
major layoffs ever in its struggle to restructure and boost 
profits 
laura ashley is a classic ragstoriches tale begun as a small 
cottage industry 36 years ago by mrs ashley and husband bernard on 
the kitchen table of a london attic flat 
it became an international force but analysts say it has failed 
to change with the times traditional shops are near the saturation 
point in britain and the united states 
however the laura ashley look has proved to have enduring 
appeal 
welshborn mrs ashleys legacy includes a vibrant design 
ethos in tune with nostalgia for the past as well as the new age 
ideology of the nineties fashion writer liz smith recently wrote 
in the times of london 
a great void was created in the company when mrs ashley known 
as la died of head injuries in september 1985 at age 60 after 
a fall down steep stairs at her daughters west england home 
it happened just as the company was opening a flagship store in 
london and two months before laura ashley shares were sold on the 
stock market 
mrs ashleys successors insisted the business would thrive 
because it was a design house not a onewoman show but the 
company says her original concepts remain the foundation 
bernard ashley knighted in 1987 continues as chairman but 
pursues other interests such as the development of a chain of 
ashley inn hotels 
the daytoday management is left to john james a welshman and 
longtime employee named chief executive two years ago the ashleys 
son nick one of four children serves as design director the 
ashley family with the ashley foundation retains 70 percent of 
the companys stock 
the situation is quite different from 1985 when investors 
rushed to benefit from laura ashleys expansion plans crowds lined 
up to buy laura ashley shares in a 36 million sale that was 34 
times oversubscribed 
the shares sold for the equivalent of 212 each now they trade 
at the equivalent of 126 at londons stock exchange 
earnings fell 38 percent to 66 million or 3 cents a share on 
a 15 percent revenue gain to 211 million in the six months ended 
july 29 
it is having problems its a very difficult phase said 
joan dolier retail analyst at the london investment firm county 
natwest woodmac theres a lot of potential there still but its 
very difficult to realize it 
analyst kimlan cook of the smith new court plc investment firm 
said it hasnt been that nobody likes laura ashley clothes 
anymore its just a question of translating that into profits 
which laura ashley has quite frankly failed to do 
mrs cook blamed that failure on what she called undirected 
growth and inadequate financial controls the companys 
manufacturing segment which makes most of what laura ashley sells 
hasnt been responding to retailing demands 
the ashleys started printing fabrics on the kitchen table in 
1953 bernard designed furnishing prints and printing machines 
laura made place mats and scarves which she sold to london 
department stores 
the couple expanded into garments and eventually into 
accessories wall paper and soft furnishings 
the clothes are affordable feminine and rural made of natural 
fabrics they have flowing lines wildflower prints frills and 
bows the company sells lots of sweet dresses high neck blouses 
sailor outfits and navy blue basics 
i dont like ephemeral things laura ashley once said i 
like things that last forever like the straw hat youre fond of 
and wear all your life 
the ashleys moved to wales in 1961 and six years later 
established company headquarters in a disused railway station in 
carno 
the first laura ashley shop opened in londons posh south 
kensington district in 1968 and in 1974 the first american store 
opened in san francisco 
the laura ashley look harking back to an imagined victorian age 
of bucolic simplicity also struck a chord in the united states 
where sales quickly rivaled sales at home 
at the end of its last fiscal year laura ashley operated 172 
stores in north america and 164 in britain and ireland it had 
more than 400 shops worldwide 8000 employees and 17 factories 
despite the fast growth maternal mrs ashley considered 
employees an extension of our family she gave them stock 
ended the workweek early on friday and insisted the canteen serve 
healthy food 
its present more corporateminded management has sought to slim 
down operations and has broken the company into divisions 
responsible for their onw profits 
laura ashley also has been acquiring some smaller clothing and 
accessory businesses updating its clothing designs to give widen 
appeal and opening freestanding home furnishings stores to 
attract more men it also has developed a popular mother and 
child collection of coordinated clothes 
how long that strategy will take to bear fruit to the bottom 
line is another question mrs cook said

us retailers sales rebounded in november 
the government said wednesday in a report analysts saw as showing 
strongerthanexpected christmas buying and less chance of a 
recession 
the 08 percent increase the biggest in four months clearly 
signals that the economy is resilient said richard w rahn 
chief economist for the us chamber of commerce fears of a poor 
christmas retail season should abate with this report 
its clearly stronger than was expected said david jones 
an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new york government 
securities dealer as long as spending holds up theres no 
threat of a recession 
the commerce department said that sales rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 1446 billion in november after plummeting 13 percent in 
october when they were driven down by skidding automobile sales 
the october sales were revised after originally being reported to 
have fallen 1 percent 
many economists were expecting only a weak improvement in 
november since unit car sales fell again in november 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group in 
washington said the 05 percent increase in the automotive 
category probably reflected an increase in prices not sales 
excluding the auto category the report was even more positive 
showing a 09 percent advance 
automakers reported wednesday that sales of cars and trucks by 
the nations eight major automakers continued to drop in early 
december sinking 237 percent from last years level 
jones suggested a shift in christmaspresent buying patterns 
might have contributed to the november strength and might mean more 
moderate growth this month 
were getting more and more spending in the last week of 
november and less in the first weeks of december he said the 
way to measure the christmas season now is to average the november 
and december spending patterns 
and ms shaber added its taken a lot of priceslashing to 
get those sales so even if dollar sales are decent this christmas 
its unclear whether the profits will be so great 
retail sales account for about onethird of the nations 
economic activity and david wyss senior financial economist for 
drimcgrawhill in lexington mass said the stronger november 
report caused him to boost his estimate of overall growth 
wyss said if strong sales continue in december the gross 
national product could increase at a 1 percent rate in the final 
quarter of the year instead of the 05 percent he had been 
predicting 
this relieves the worries that the fourth quarter could turn 
into a negative quarter he said 
not all analysts were as upbeat however bruce steinberg 
senior economist at merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
pointed out that sales in both september and october had been 
revised downward 
i dont think we are going to have a recession but it is 
still iffy steinberg said 
there had been concern that christmas spending would be held 
back by a slowing economy 
but even sales of durable goods bigticket items expected to 
last at least three years posted a 07 percent gain after falling 
3 percent in october these sales often are affected by the feds 
interestrate policies because many are financed by loans 
sales of building materials were up 2 percent reflecting in 
part repairs following hurricane hugo and the san francisco 
bayarea earthquake the category had fallen 11 percent in october 
furniture and other home furnishing sales gained 16 percent on 
top of a 08 percent increase the previous month 
sales of nondurable goods rose 09 percent following a 03 
percent decline in october 
all nondurable goods categories except drug stores posted 
increases general merchandise including department stores sales 
up 07 percent grocery stores 08 percent gasoline stations 09 
percent apparel 24 percent and restaurants and bars 09 
percent 
drug store sales were down 01 percent 
for the three months from august through october overall retail 
sales were up 48 percent sales for the first 11 months of 1989 
were up 57 percent over the same period of 1988

tuesday republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for

the bulls would like to see the dollar go up and they say it

lower and seem to be winning the battle overall glamuzina said

gorbachev had resigned although they were swiftly denied by the 
soviet embassy in washington currency dealers said also 
supporting the dollar were reports of intervention by some central 
banks to push down the value of the surging west germany mark they 
said

mexicos reviving economy is on display at 
la plaza mall where the parking lot is full of license plates from 
across the border 
in this city 10 miles north of the rio grande and all along the 
usmexico frontier one fact of international trade stands out 
mexican shoppers have returned to the united states to visit and 
shop recovering from the brutal 1980s that brought la crisis 
the banco nacional de mexico says mexicans are spending as much 
and possibly more money on the us side of the border than they 
did 10 years ago 
as a result mcallens la plaza mall has the highest sales per 
square foot of any of the 70 us shopping centers owned by the 
indianapolis indbased melvin simon and associates said tom 
jenkins southern regional manager with the firm la plazas 
average merchandise sales of 404 per square foot is more than 
double the firms national average of 189 per square foot 
the companys no 2 mall is el pasos cielo vista with sales of 
338 per square foot jenkins said 
he attributes much of the border malls success to the crowds of 
mexican shoppers returning over the past two years 
the mexican nationals what theyre looking for is quality 
jenkins said they are not looking for sales 
we have a lot of monterrey traffic that drives a lot of 
traffic from mexico city that fly and the regular bus traffic that 
come across said tommy joyner executive director of the mcallen 
chamber of commerce 
that is a vast improvement over just a few years ago after huge 
oil revenues and massive public spending and borrowing led to a 
brief boom from 197981 a sudden drop in oil prices in 1981 
fractured the mexican economy 
mexicans watched the peso diminish from a value of 26 to the 
dollar at the beginning of 1982 to 149 to the dollar by the end of 
that year 
border retailers on the us side soon found their stores empty 
the mexicans money suddenly bought only onesixth of what it used 
to buy so they no longer could shop in the united states the 
disappearance of the mexican shopper quickly drove many stores out 
of business all along the border 
mexican expenditures in texas new mexico arizona and 
california by 1983 dropped to half of what they were in 1979 
business in 1983 was off 80 percent in downtown mcallen said 
larry fallek owner of mikes man shop and the palais de parfum in 
downtown mcallen and another mens clothing store at la plaza mall 
he estimated that 85 percent of his downtown sales and 60 
percent of mall sales are to mexicans 
although the peso by 1987 dropped to 2500 to the dollar as 
foreign debt plagued the nation mexicos economy since has begun 
to calm down the exchange rate fell only to about 2650 by 
december 1989 
mexicans are spending abroad again because the peso has 
stabilized and because of new confidence in president carlos 
salinas de gortaris economic liberalization said isabel bagnasco 
an economist with the mexico citybased banco nacional de mexico 
we are now having an economy with stable prices she said 
if mexican spending on the us side of the border for the 
second half of 1989 continues at the rate of the first half us 
retailers will surpass the 224 billion sales to mexicans that 
banco nacional estimated for the boom year of 1979 during 1988 
mexican purchases of 209 billion in texas new mexico arizona 
and california were 500 million higher than in 1987 the bank said 
steady growth in mexicos 1500 border assembly plants or 
maquiladoras also has boosted the buying power of a new 
industrial work force of about 350000 
when mexico comes across it stirs up the whole economy 
said retailer fallek in mcallen they feel better about 
themselves about their country and their government right now 
they dont seem so worried 
retail sales growth of 226 percent in 1988 in the mcallen area 
was the biggest increase of all the states metropolitan areas 
according to the state comptrollers office in the adjacent 
brownsvilleharlingen area at the southern tip of the state retail 
sales grew by 158 percent in 1988 in el paso the retail growth 
rate was 95 percent 
for comparison sales grew state wide by only 64 percent in 
1988 
retailers say this year will turn out even better fallek said 
the gradual return of the mexican shoppers since last year will 
make 1989 his best year since 1981 
brownsville retailer michael begum said he also has seen a 
steady improvement in sales since the peso crash cut his sales in 
half his downtown new yorker store caters to customers like the 
woman from matamoros mexico who on a recent friday stopped in 
looking for something to wear to a party and bought a 2500 fur 
coat 
at the other end of the border san ysidro calif retailers 
see the same recovery said doug perry president of the chamber of 
commerce 
there doesnt seem to be a lot of retail space available for 
anything particularly close to the border perry said 
another positive economic sign in mexico is the cooling of its 
runaway inflation that hit 159 percent in 1987 inflation dropped 
to 52 percent in 1988 and is projected to be 20 percent for 1989 
and 15 percent in 1990 
inflation however still makes many products cheaper in the 
united states than in mexico inflationfighting consumers can be 
found among the mexicans driving or flying home with new dresses 
and toys as well as those carrying bags of toilet paper and 
groceries across the international bridges

the chairman of great northern nekoosa 
corp said wednesday his paper company is not discussing any 
white knight friendly mergers or defensive restructuring to 
thwart the takeover attempt by georgiapacific corp 
great northern instead is pinning its hopes on courtroom 
decisions to fend off the unsolicited 63 a share tender offer 
valued at a total of 38 billion 
while were in the courts were not considering anything 
else william r laidig chairman and chief executive of great 
northern 
naturally were talking to our financial advisers about what 
the future would look like when we finish winning this court fight 
with georgiapacific but theres actually no specific work going 
on right now and we certainly are not looking for a white knight 
laidig said 
laidig said other paper company executives have brought up the 
takeover attempt but he has made sure not to get into any talks 
about alternate mergers when georgiapacific made its initial 
offer of 58 per share on oct 31 there was speculation by some 
analysts that other paper companies might enter the bidding but 
that has not happened 
great northern stock finished down 50 cents at 6175 a share on 
wednesday georgia pacific was unchanged at 5087 a share 
ive talked to some other ceos who have said theyre sorry to 
see this situation the way it is but nobodys gone any farther 
than that because i wouldnt have let them even if they wanted 
to laidig said 
laidig would not name any of the executives he had talked to 
but said great northern also has heard from foreign companies that 
are watching the situation 
we sell a lot overseas and there have been people who 
questioned whether there was a longterm interest in staying 
independent or something like that laidig said 
now whether that characterized the fact that they might be 
interested in some other action or not i dont know we certainly 
have had a lot of our customers overseas who have indicated they 
are interested in whether we do or do not stay independent but 
none of them have come forward and said wed like to buy you or 
buy this or buy that or anything like that 
the legal battles are being fought in federal court in maine 
where georgiapacific filed a lawsuit challenging great northerns 
poison pill takeover defense and a state antitakeover law and 
in connecticut where great northern has filed an antitrust suit 
against georgiapacific 
the federal trade commission in washington also is examining the 
proposed merger for potential antitrust problems and is expected to 
state any objections by dec 21 
we think that our offer for great northern will succeed and 
we think our acquisition offer fully complies with antritrust 
laws spokeswoman gail smith said wednesday from 
georgiapacifics headquarters in atlanta 
laidig was in portland on wednesday for a news conference at 
which he defended company lawyers for persuading us district 
judge gene carter to unseal a georgiapacific consultants study 
that showed different cashflow scenarios based on a theoretical 
merger followed by sales of great northern mills in maine georgia 
and wisconsin 
georgiapacific said the study unsealed this week had been 
rejected long ago and accused great northern of a cheap shot 
laidig said his company felt that people in maine were entitled 
to the information and georgiapacific should have disclosed it 
previously 
but in response to a question laidig said he would not make 
promises about great northerns willingness to protect jobs and 
sensitive woodlands the company based in norwalk conn and 
incorporated in maine has been in business for almost a century in 
maine and doesnt believe it has to prove anything to mainers he 
said

gold futures prices fell sharply wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange as the soviet union rejected reforms that many 
investors had hoped would lead to a goldbacked soviet currency 
futures prices of silver and platinum also plunged frustrating 
speculators in the increasingly volatile preciousmetals markets 
on other commodity markets heating oil for nearterm delivery 
rose for the 11th straight day livestock and meat futures 
advanced and grains and soybeans were mostly higher 
gold futures fell 980 to 1080 with the contract for delivery

1370 to 1410 with the january contract settling at 50470 a 
troy ounce 
from midoctober through late november gold soared from near 
360 an ounce to almost 420 partly on ideas that the economic 
changes sweeping eastern europe would include a move by the soviet 
union to back its currency the ruble with gold 
such a move would greatly increase the rubles value on the 
world market where it is now almost useless facilitating trade 
with other countries 
a goldbacked ruble apparently was not discussed by the soviet 
parliament wednesday but they rejected other radical economic 
reforms disappointing gold traders who had hoped for some strong 
indication of change analysts said 
theres been a lot of speculation but so far not anything 
done and i think thats kind of frustrated people said stephen 
platt metals analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
people were looking for something out of the politburo 
analyst james steel of refco inc in new york said the gold 
selloff also appeared linked to an unconfirmed but persistent rumor 
that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev had offered to resign 
the rumor has shaken confidence in people who bought gold on 
speculation of soviet reform he said 
january heating oil futures surged on the new york mercantile

the conviction of gaf corp and its vice 
chairman strengthens a belief that the governments pursuit of 
whitecollar wrongdoing is getting through to the public lawyers 
said wednesday 
one day after hotel queen leona helmsley was sentenced to seven 
years in prison for tax evasion a federal jury convicted chemicals 
manufacturer gaf corp and vice chairman james t sherwin of stock 
manipulation securities fraud and other charges 
the verdict which followed two mistrials in the same case 
earlier this year was another notch in the governments belt of 
securities fraud convictions 
but some lawyers said it was surprising because of controversial 
and often contradictory testimony by admitted felon boyd l 
jefferies and surprise evidence introduced at the trials close 
undermining central portions of the governments case 
the pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that if 
there is some smoke there circumstantial evidence then juries 
tend to find there is some fire columbia university securities 
law professor john c coffee jr said 
i do think the jury particularly in wall street cases has a 
good deal of skepticism of the motives of people he said this 
is a case where there was some evidence but it was a onewitness 
case 
wayne njbased gaf sherwin and two subsidiaries were 
convicted of eight counts of stock manipulation securities fraud 
wire fraud and conspiracy two gaf subsidiaries were acquitted of 
all charges 
they were found guilty of manipulating the price of union 
carbide corp stock in collaboration with jefferies in october 
1986 seeking to push up the share price before selling a large 
block gaf had amassed in a failed takeover 
with the exception of one split verdict juries this year have 
returned convictions in all major wall street fraud cases against 
six defendants in the princetonnewport partners trial takeover 
specialist paul a bilzerian drexel burnham lambert inc bond 
trading assistant lisa jones and others 
in addition the government has obtained guilty pleas from 
figures such as former investment banker martin a siegel 
arbitrager robert freeman and stock speculator salim b lewis 
its another part of the message that the us attorneys 
office has been sending to the financially fortunate of our 
country that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failure 
to pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with said attorney 
gerald walpin a former prosecutor 
the gaf jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours of 
testimony the second mistrial in march was declared after 12 
days and 93 hours of deliberations the first mistrial was declared 
because the government unintentionally withheld a piece of evidence 
maybe all the media concentration on fraud on wall street has 
pressured the public that all the fraud on wall street was more 
severe than it thought initially said alan bromberg a 
securities law professor at southern methodist university 
i think were developing a pretty healthy distrust of our 
financial institutions he said 
gaf lawyer arthur liman introduced evidence in the last week of 
the trial that appeared to show that telephone calls allegedly made 
by jefferies to sherwin after jefferies tried to manipulate the 
stock never actually occurred 
it seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but the 
jury didnt think so said one defense lawyer in a major case who 
asked not to be named

energy futures prices finished mixed wednesday 
with demand strong for wholesale home heating oil for delivery next 
month 
a collapse in a rally in european gasoil the equivalent of us 
heating oil took some of the edge off the buying enthusiasm here 
analysts said 
the contract for january delivery of no2 heating oil rose 066 
cent to 6796 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange 
adding to tuesdays gain of 035 cent but contracts for delivery 
during february through april fell by amounts ranging from 035 
cent to 060 cent 
the nearby heating oil contract gained support from continuing 
cold weather in parts of the united states and particularly strong 
demand for new york harbor oil predictions of rising temperatures 
in europe discouraged buyers in london 
among other refined oil products traded on the new york merc 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for january delivery which dropped 
037 cent on tuesday sank another 010 cent to 5193 cents a 
gallon other contracts also closed lower 
the weakening in gasoline futures is typical for this time of 
year when driving declines due to bad weather conditions 
the january contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil rose 12 cents to 2077 per 42gallon 
barrel the february through april contracts ended 1 cent lower to 
4 cents higher 
richard kane a trader for merrill lynch energy futures said 
prices opened higher in reaction to a fairly bullish report from 
the american petroleum institute the weekly statistics released 
after the market closed on tuesday showed an unexpectedly large 
reduction in crude oil stocks 
the initial strength faded in what kane characterized as a 
technical price correction

rh macy amp co on wednesday disclosed its 
financial losses grew significantly in the late summer and early 
autumn due to costs promotions aimed at boosting sales 
the retailer said it lost 3312 million or 2392 a share in 
its first fiscal quarter of 1990 compared with a loss of 19 
million or 15 a share in the same period a year earlier 
sales rose 52 percent to 171 billion in the three months 
ended oct 28 from 162 billion a year earlier 
macy which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986 
disclosed the losses in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission 
in a separate letter to investors macy chairman edward s 
finkelstein described the retailing climate as chaotic and said 
the first quarter results were somewhat disappointing although 
essentially as expected 
in the sec filing macy attributed the firstquarter loss to the 
effects of increased markdowns taken in response to a highly 
competitive retail environment 
we expect a sluggish economy this spring but we are determined 
to run a profitable business expensed conservatively with improved 
margins even with modest sales growth read the letter which was 
signed by finkelstein and macy president mark s handler 
macy opened two department stores during the quarter although 
it said it doesnt plan to open any others until 1991 when one new 
store is planned 
that temporary hiatus of new store activity has a double 
benefit we can concentrate our energies on improvement of stores 
already in operation and capital expenditures will be capped at 
levels significantly below plan enhancing our cash flow the 
letter read 
macy said losses from the san francisco earthquake which 
damaged its macys california and i magnin subsidiaries did not 
impact the latest results

integrated resources inc on wednesday announced 
a secondquarter loss of more than 1 billion due to failing 
businesses and cheap asset sales in a bid to avoid bankruptcy 
the struggling financial services firm said the loss exceeded a 
previously anticipated 600 million decline mainly because of 
substantially lowerthanexpected proceeds from the sale of its 
core businesses 
integrated reported a loss of 104 billion or 14115 a share 
on revenue of 7059 million in the apriljune quarter that 
compared with earnings of 1278 million or 68 cents a share in 
the same period a year earlier 
the once highflying real estate concern stumbled trying to 
expand into financial services integrated attributed the delay in 
reporting its secondquarter results to drastic changes since it 
defaulted on nearly 1 billion in debt in june 
integrated stock closed unchanged at 37 cents wednesday in new 
york stock exchange trading before announcing the default 
integrated traded at around 15 a share 
obviously what happened to them in a major way is just 
shocking said tom fendrich a managing director for standard amp 
poors corp everybody knew that integrated was a deteriorating 
situation but nobody expected it to be an exploding one 
integrated is seeking to restructure its debt and raise capital 
to meet payments on a total of 175 billion in debt to and avoid 
seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors 
the bulk of the secondquarter losses was pinned on writedowns 
in the value of businesses and assets integrated has sold 
discontinued or plans to sell because of its financial troubles 
a major contributor to the loss was the muchreduced sale price 
for its central financial services businesses 
integrated in november reached agreement to sell the businesses 
to broad inc a los angeles financial services concern for a 
maximum of 225 million it had hoped to receive 450 million 
that deal which is pending is subject to price adjustments at 
the time of closing that are expected to lower its value 
these losses reflect the serious impact of our liquidity 
problems integrated said in a statement we are attempting to 
address these problems by working with our creditors to restructure 
the debt 
for the first six months of 1989 integrated reported a loss of 
104 billion or 14193 a share on revenue of 1808 million 
compared with profits of 1986 million or 59 cents a share on 
2138 million in revenue a year earlier 
the writedowns affect the financial services subsidiaries being 
sold to broad integrated life insurance co of des moines iowa 
capitol life insurance co of denver integrated resources asset 
management corp an investment adviser integrated resources 
equity corp its main brokerdealer subsidiary and resources 
trust co 
integrated said 110 million of the loss resulted from 
restructuring expenses 
the firm also cited poor industry conditions for the sale of 
limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts an absence 
of revenue because of the termination or restructuring of some 
investment programs and higher interest payments because of 
increased borrowing

massachusetts got the lowest state credit rating 
in the nation wednesday when standard amp poors dropped its 
longterm bond rating from a to bbb 
that put massachusetts a step below louisiana which is rated 
bbb plus said cathy daicoff sampps managing director of municipal 
finance 
only a year ago the states economic boom was such that it was 
dubbed the massachusetts miracle and nearly carried gov michael 
dukakis to the white house now the legislature is struggling with 
tax hikes to ease an estimated 800 million budget deficit for the 
current fiscal year 
massachusetts is the lowestrated state ms daicoff said 
moodys investors service the other major rating service 
dropped massachusetts last month from a to baa 1 tying it with 
lousiana as the lowestrated state 
the two services use different ratings and different symbols so 
they are not directly comparable ms daicoff said 
state treasurer robert q crane said he wasnt surprised by 
sampps action 
you cant argue with the fact there is a serious shortfall 
he said 
the only way it can be addressed is by some very important and 
difficult cuts in our way of life plus an input of fresh new 
revenue streams whether they be sales tax sin tax or income tax 
increases crane said 
dukakis chief financial adviser admininstration and finance 
secretary l edward lashman said the bonds still carry an 
investmentgrade rating allowing them to be purchased by major 
pension funds and other institutional investors 
asked if there was a danger of massachusetts rating falling 
into the junkbond category lashman said if we dont get a tax 
package very soon we are in serious danger of it 
ms daicoff said credit rating wouldnt be upgraded immediately 
even if the state were to erase the budget deficit of about 800 
million for the current fiscal year 
for a higher rating to be assigned we would have to see a 
sharp reversal of the financial trends of the last 18 months she 
said we would also have to be assured that any future fiscal 
problems are addressed in a prudent fashion 
sampp expects the state to remain under fiscal stress for some 
period of time she said 
crane said he hoped the rating would improve before february 
the next time the state plans to go to market with longterm debt 
but lashman agreed an upgrading would take a long time 
the last time this happened it took us 13 years to get back 
to a top rating lashman said 
sampp said the downgrading affects 46 billion in outstanding 
direct general obligation state bonds 
the ratings service also lowered from a to bbb the ratings on 
25 billion in agency debt secured by state guarantees that debt 
includes bonds issued by state authorities when the borrowing is 
not backed up by a stream of dedicated revenue such as tolls or 
fees 
sampp also lowered the rating on 747 million in direct general 
obligation shortterm notes from sp1 to sp2 
however ms daicoff said the states planned sale of 12 
billion in shortterm commercial paper will carry the highest 
a1plus rating because it is backed by a letter of credit from 
three japanese banks 
that sale includes 700 million in new borrowing and a 500 
million rollover of existing shortterm debt the borrowing is 
required for the state to make a 11 billion aid payment to cities 
and towns at the end of the month 
the rating is based on the banks creditworthyness not the 
commonwealths ms daicoff said

federated and allied department stores owned 
by the deeply indebted campeau corp may file for bankruptcy as 
early as january if lenders dont agree to restructure their 7 
billion debt according to a published report 
the cincinnatibased retailers said in a securities and exchange 
commission filing released wednesday that they would run out of 
cash by midmarch and possibly as early as january unless creditors 
ease repayment schedules 
what happens depends largely upon the cooperation that is 
required from our bondholders and other lenders so we will pursue 
that cooperation aggressively campeau spokeswoman carol sanger 
told the cincinnati enquirer for an article to be published in 
thursdays editions 
according to the newspaper the sec filing said any hesitation 
by lenders could force the company to seek federal bankruptcy 
protection under chapter 11 the document said the stores expect to 
begin discussions with lenders soon but had no assurance they 
would reach agreement 
hopefully well be able to manage our way through this period 
and conduct the restructuring process on a voluntary basis without 
going the bankruptcy route ms sanger said 
campeau stock tumbled 1 to close at 4 a drop of 20 percent in 
overthecounter trading wednesday largely on market rumors of a 
possible bankruptcy filing analysts said 
the firms cited problems in their sec filing that could 
jeopardize their survival 
performance in the fourth quarter the period including the 
christmas shopping season when the companies make more than half 
their profits has fallen below a forecast that left little or 
no margin for error 
federated could already be in default on some of the financial 
performance clauses in loan agreements and allied will likely 
breach them soon 
federated must pay off 276 million of bonds on jan 27 and 
another 720 million on feb1 
the burdensome debt load is something that is becoming 
increasingly difficult to manage ms sanger said it requires 
a tremendous amount of cash infusions 
federated department stores and allied stores took on immense 
debt much of it in high interest junk bonds as part of their 
takeover by canadian real estate magnate robert campeau campeau 
bought federated in may 1988 and allied in december 1986 
their difficulty in meeting the massive interest payments 
prompted an earlier financial restructuring and the ouster of 
campeau as chairman when olympia amp york developments ltd of canada 
bailed out campeau corp in september 
torontobased campeau put bloomingdales the crown jewel of its 
retailing empire up for sale in september after the beleagured 
company said it was being forced to restructure under the weight of 
8 billion in debt from its acquisition of federated and allied 
federated is negotiating with six bidders to sell the 
bloomingdales chain in february in order to repay a 105 billion 
shortterm loan by april 30 
but there is no assurance that sale will yield enough to pay the 
companys debts the document said 
among federateds holdings is lazarus department stores a 
43store chain based in cincinnati 
jerry gafford vice president of corporate affairs at lazarus 
downplayed wednesdays news 
were not worried about the possibility of being sold he 
said this is something that needs to be done by the campeau 
organization were viewing it as business as usual 
there also is no reason to believe manufacturers will cease 
merchandise shipments to the retailer gafford added 
ms sanger said federated and allied wouldnt close if they seek 
federal bankruptcy protection chapter 11 allows companies to 
remain in business while developing a plan to repay their debts 
wednesdays filing follows disclosure tuesday of worsening 
losses at federated and allied for the third quarter despite 
increases in sales 
besides lazarus and bloomingdales federated operates 
manhattans abraham amp straus burdines in miami and richs and the 
goldsmith stores in atlanta 
allied stores operations include bostonbased jordan marsh 
maas brothersjordan marsh in florida bon marche in seattle and

cable tv magnate ted turner is back 
in the hunt for mgmua communications co trying to negotiate a 
noncash deal for turner broadcasting to acquire mgmua people 
close to the talks said wednesday 
the entrepreneur needs films to feed turner network television 
his yearold cable network mgmua controlled by beverly hills 
billionaire kirk kerkorian has just that a 1000picture library 
of united artists movies that include the james bond rocky and 
pink panther series 
turner already owns rights to the even larger library of mgm 
films which he purchased from kerkorian in 1986 if he acquired 
the united artists films and some new mgm movies from kerkorian he 
would control rights to about 4000 pictures 
a parade of famous companies and individuals have considered 
buying mgmua since kerkorian put the studio up for sale a year and 
a half ago bidders such as turner and media mogul rupert murdoch 
have been seeking programming for ventures both here and abroad 
murdoch for example has started the fox tv network here and 
extensive satellite tv ventures in britain and in continental 
europe he offered 14 billion for mgm but was outbid in 
september by australias qintex group which later was unable to 
get financing for its 15 billion offer 
those offers were for cash but turner is instead trying to 
negotiate a deal to swap stock in their companies with kerkorian 
according to reports in the los angeles times and wall street 
journal that were confirmed wednesday by a studio executive 
extended by his many ventures turner is not sitting on a pile 
of cash said the executive speaking on condition of anonymity 
the reports on the stock swap talks are the latest in a series 
of stories on kerkorians negotiations with buyers including turner 
and two companies that own a stake in turner broadcasting 
denverbased cable giant telecommunications inc and time warner 
inc in new york 
among others recently interested in mgmua was a foreign venture 
jointly controlled by mca inc and paramount communications 
but mca president sid sheinberg said wednesday those 
negotiations had been only loose proposals adding were 
certainly not in the running for it now 
neither turner broadcasting nor mgmua would comment officially 
on the talks wednesday and kerkorians personal spokesman jim 
mahoney said he had no knowledge of where negotiations stand 
kerkorian wants to make a deal mahoney said the 
company is in play but if he cant make a deal he can live with 
that too people forget that outside of mca chairman lew 
wasserman kirk has run a studio longer than anyone in hollywood 
and hes been successful at it 
mahoney added hes willing to start back into production of 
films if no deal can be made 
filmmaking has virtually halted at the studio since kerkorian 
put the company up for sale in april 1988 
entertainment analyst jeffrey logsdon of the crowell weedon 
brokerage in los angeles estimated it would take at least 250 
million a year for two years to get the studio back into full 
production but mahoney said that figure was far too high

house majority leader richard gephardt and 
other members of the democratic leadership complained wednesday 
that president bush is relying for economic counsel from aides who 
have also served as advisers for japan 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater dismissed the complaint 
as a political cheap shot 
president bush himself in a brief exchange with reporters as he 
left the oval office early in the evening said mr gephardts 
complaining so whats new 
gephardt and 11 other house democrats sent a letter to white 
house counsel and ethics watchdog boyden gray saying they were 
deeply troubled by reports that senior officials in the 
administration may be serving in the dual capacity of advising the 
us government while simultaneously providing counsel advice or 
other services to foreign governments corporations or other 
foreign entities 
they said the chief japan expert for the presidents council of 
economic advisers university of michigan professor gary r 
saxonhouse is an adviser to japanese financial groups including a 
research institute financed by japans ministry of international 
trade and industry 
they also noted that michael boskin chairman of the presidents 
council and bushs chief economic adviser served on the board of a 
similar institute supported by the japanese finance ministry before 
he took his current post 
this raises serious questions about conflicts of interest 
said the dec 12dated letter the democrats asked gray to identify 
other administration officials who serve in a dual capacity 
with any foreign entity 
fitzwater said boskin had quit the japanese advisory panel in 
december 1988 a month before the start of the bush administration 
boskin was then a stanford university economics professor he had 
been a top adviser tobush during the 1988 campaign 
saxonhouse is an unpaid adviser on a japanese ministry board 
that has not met in two years said fitzwater he said saxonhouse 
works only part time for the white house and theres no conflict 
of interest 
saxonhouse is not subject to ethics rules that cover the white 
house staff 
gephardts a japanbasher thats all said fitzwater 
gephardt could not be immediately reached for comment he is in 
europe his staff said 
gephardt sought the democratic presidential nomination in 1988 
on a platform of tough trade laws to restrict imports from 
countries with big trade imbalances with the united states such as 
japan 
the democrats complaint was sparked by an article in sundays 
new york times on japans lobbying efforts in washington and its 
ties to american academics 
also signing the letter were democrats william gray of 
pennsylvania the house majority whip david bonior of michigan 
the chief deputy whip steny hoyer of maryland chairman of the 
house democratic caucus vic fazio of california vice chairman of 
the caucus dan glickman of kansas howard wolpe of michigan 
dennis eckart and marcy kaptur of ohio robert torricelli of new 
jersey bob wise of west virginia and david nagle of iowa
