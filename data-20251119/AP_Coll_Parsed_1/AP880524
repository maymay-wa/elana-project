a jet making an approach in nasty weather 
tuesday lost power in both engines and made an emergency landing 
near an abandoned world war ii airstrip about five miles short of 
the nearest airport authorities said 
the taca international airlines plane was on its way from san 
salvador and had made a stop at belize all 36 passengers and nine 
crew members scrambled unharmed from the plane to a nearby levee as 
a driving rainstorm started 
a taca official peter messina said the the cause of the engine 
trouble was unknown and that the apparently undamaged aircraft was 
only three weeks old 
it landed on a narrow strip of grass its wings barely fitting 
between a drainage canal on one side and a levee on the other 
witnesses said the plane was close to but not on the actual landing 
strip 
crew members brushed past reporters without talking passengers 
were given little opportunity to talk as they were escorted away by 
police and customs officials but when they did speak they heaped 
praise on the jets pilot identified by messina as carlos dardano 
of el salvador about 35 years old a veteran of about 5 years with 
taca 
it was a very smooth landing said passenger july mora a 
travel agent from new orleans i thought we were at the airport 
i was surprised to learn we had landed on a levee 
as the pilot said by the grace of god i got this sucker on 
the ground said the rev leo humphrey 52 a baptist missionary 
returning to new orleans from a ministry in el salvador 
although the landing was smooth the preceding moments were 
frightening passengers said 
we went through rain and severe turbulence and i thought i 
heard them say lightning hit the plane said mora although 
officials later could not confirm that lightning hit the aircraft 
ive never been on a plane that was so violent im sure the 
people were pretty bruised from their seatbelts said humphrey 
the plane was going up and down sideways and twisting 
lightning was everywhere the lights went out on the plane and the 
engine died everyone thought it was over 
the pilot radioed shortly after noon that he lost power in both 
engines of the boeing 737 said paul bourg an area supervisor at 
the control tower at new orleans international airport 
control was in the process of trying to direct him to 
lakefront airport which is our civil aviation airport a little 
small but a 737 could use it bourg said 
about five miles from that airport the pilot informed 
controller that he couldnt make it that he was going in the 
pilot spotted this unused airstrip 
the grasscovered strip is between a national aeronautics and 
space administration complex and the mississippi river gulf outlet 
a straightline shortcut paralleling the mississippi river from the 
gulf of mexico to the port of new orleans 
a thunderstorm warning from the national weather service was in 
effect at the time and there were high winds and lightning in the 
area 
bourg could not say if weather was a factor in the planes 
trouble 
the plane landed behind the us department of agriculture 
offices at the nasa complex 
kathy fernandez a usda employee said she had stepped outside 
and saw the plane come down about 400 yards away 
it was a clean landing she said it came down nice just 
fine as soon as it landed the door opened the chute came down 
and the people came out and ran away from the plane 
as soon as they got out they just ran up the levee in the 
back it started raining about five minutes after that it really 
started to pour 
she and bob ural another usda employee said they heard no 
engines as the plane came down ural said the plane descended as 
silently as a glider 
passengers and crew were sequestered in an area of the nasa 
complex for more than three hours then taken quickly in a group to 
a waiting chartered bus and on to new orleans international about 
24 miles away 
taca has been based in san salvador el salvador for over 50 
years but is usowned and has its main office in new orleans an 
officials at the main office said the airline did not have any more 
information on the reason for the landing 
tom branigan a spokesman for martinmarietta corp the main 
contractor at the space facility said there is an overgrown paved 
strip at the facility but that the plane came down on the grass 
he said it did not appear that the landing gear collapsed and 
that from a quartermile no damage to the plane was visible 
he said two passengers with preexisting medical problems one 
recent surgery and one high blood pressure were taken to the 
medical facility on the premises for observation 
customs officials were called he said 
employees at martin marietta helped the passengers get to nearby 
buildings branigan said

they came to appalachia in the late 
1960s and early 1970s as eager young college students determined 
to wipe out something most of them had never experienced firsthand 
rural poverty 
as they prepare for a reunion on memorial day weekend former 
members of volunteers in service to america appalachian volunteers 
and other federal volunteer programs say their work showed the 
power of community action but often put them at odds with local 
officials 
if they made some difference in the lives of poor people in west 
virginia kentucky tennessee and virginia the volunteers also 
agree their own lives were changed 
thenvolunteer nowus sen jay rockefeller called his vista 
work in the tiny community of emmons a turning point in his life 
after two years i got hooked said rockefeller who later 
gave up his plans for a foreign service career to serve in west 
virginias legislature and as secretary of state and governor 
before winning election to the senate in 1984 
linda cooper elkinton who served in kentucky said the 
experience of recruiting 500 eager agents of social change 
started her on a life of community organizing 
i was not a politically aware person at 18 said elkinton 
who now works for a social service agency in huntington but i 
certainly was three years later after volunteering 
the volunteers first hurdle was gaining acceptance 
the poor people up the hollows accepted them pretty well 
particularly once they got to know them a little bit said jeff 
monroe who headed west virginias office of economic opportunity 
from 1964 through 1968 
but monroe said the next step acceptance by local officials 
often failed 
as long as antipoverty workers helped repaint schools organize 
recreation programs and teach nutrition classes there was little 
trouble with local power brokers but the volunteers activism 
didnt stop there 
to young idealistic college students who had taken seriously 
president johnsons challenge to replace despair with 
opportunity it soon became apparent that local politicians were 
often part of the problem 
when you start fixing up a oneroom school you start 
wondering why didnt the local school board fix this up a long 
time ago then you ask why arent there books one step at a 
time you start seeing a pattern said gibbs kinderman a former 
volunteer who recently completed a series of radio shows about 
appalachian volunteers for the west virginia humanities foundation 
volunteers realized appalachian residents had little power to 
influence their own affairs because of unresponsive and often 
corrupt bureaucrats who controlled county jobs and welfare benefits 
organizing power groups is a scary thing for any structure 
thats taking advantage of people monroe said they local 
officials were very threatened 
many impoverished appalachian residents knew well what they were 
up against and were mad about it strip mining the roads the 
schools lack of jobs the courthouse gang said ronnie sue 
jaffe now a hospital worker in new york city and an organizer of 
the may 29 reunion in twin falls state park 
kinderman described county governments in the coalmining 
regions of appalachia as set up to do things the way the coal 
companies wanted it 
huey perry whose novel theyll cut off your project 
describes antipoverty anticorruption efforts in mingo county 
said the whole system was as corrupt as it could be 
elections he said were more like sporting contests and 
after the election the losing party would just say they were 
able to buy more votes than we were 
perry said it would be hard to beat the voter turnout in mingo 
county where the 1960 federal census showed 19879 votingage 
residents but county records listed 30331 registered voters 
a fair elections committee supported by antipoverty volunteers 
but run by local residents purged the voter registration books of 
5000 people who were dead or who had moved away 
still the volunteers differ over whether their reform efforts 
had much longterm success 
in mingo county recently more than 50 present and former public 
officials among them the head of the antipoverty program were 
indicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert the free election 
system 
but said monroe that theyve been indicted at all shows a 
change there was a time when people did a lot and never got 
indicted for it 
there was a time when getting a teaching job getting on 
welfare and staying on it even getting a job on the state highways 
department were all controlled he said id venture to say 
that doesnt exist at least its much improved of course there 
are those who think im naive to say that 
you could say we didnt make any significant changes he 
added but i think we did 
the percentage of appalachian households below the federally 
defined poverty level has dropped from 312 percent in 1960 to 14 
percent in 1980 according to the appalachian regional commission 
in washington dc 
the high school dropout rate among the regions 18 to 
24yearolds has declined in the same period from 315 percent to 
253 percent the commission said 
but the average annual jobless rate in the region increased from 
54 percent in 1970 to 74 percent last year according to the us 
bureau of labor statistics 
there are still terrible pockets of unemployment in west 
virginia tennessee and kentucky said commission statistician 
judith maher 
would a new war on poverty work today 
vista has shrunk from a peak of 4580 fulltime volunteers in 
1975 to 2740 today 
antipoverty programs declined mainly because of resistance from 
local politicians and the governments growing preoccupation with 
the vietnam war perry and other observers said 
but milton ogle who recruited volunteers in kentucky and now 
works at the appalachian research and defense fund in charleston 
said more young people would volunteer today if national leaders 
again stressed social issues 
im not being political he said the fact is there has 
been a major reduction in these programs 
how is the 60s and 70s volunteer effort recalled by those 
meant to be its beneficiaries 
at least it provided some hope said herb meade of kermit 
people slowly but surely realized that some changes could be 
brought about and it did away with the fear the intimidation 
that we had among the people you dont find that much anymore 
mae shrewsbury of shady spring agreed the vista workers helped 
they gave us more courage than anything else she said

if it bombed in pretoria will it play in 
peoria paul slabolepszy hopes so 
at one theater in south africa the entire audience walked out 
on slabolepszys new antiapartheid film saturday night at the 
palace now hes looking for a more sympathetic crowd in the 
united states 
people couldnt take it slabolepszy said of the movies 
south african run its kind of like showing a movie of someone 
dying of lung cancer to an audience who are all heavy smokers its 
so real and so close 
the movie is based on a real event a rampage by two white men 
at a blackrun roadhouse on the outskirts of johannesburg it was 
made into a play that ran in south africa and europe 
slabolepszy 40 who wrote the successful play on which the film 
is based plays vince a white racist who winds up at a diner late 
one night with his nerd of a roommate forsie the black manager of 
the roadhouse played by tony awardwinning actor john kani is 
just closing up for the night 
forsie wants only to use the telephone but vince demands that 
the manager whose name is september reopen for business in a 
scene that encompasses the last half of the movie an increasingly 
ugly confrontation pits the characters in shifting allegiances 
against one another 
the movie produced and directed by south african robert davies 
is a catharsis of sorts for slabolepszy who based vinces 
character loud abusive violent on some of the people with 
whom he grew up in a small south african town the son of polish 
immigrants he moved to south africa when he was 3 years old 
i grew up in a kind of white racist area the attitudes were 
very deep he said in a recent interview and when i went to 
college university of cape town i was studying alongside 
blacks and meeting them socially and it was a stunning 
transformation because all of the prejudices id grown up with 
suddenly melted away and i realized id been living in the middle 
of this kind of lie 
i cant watch the movie he said i just slide down in my 
seat and im praying for someone to get rid of this guy vince 
its just too much it assaults and assaults and assaults but in 
a way its a story that has to be told 
at one point in the film vince the unemployed roustabout 
delivers a monologue that frames the movies political message 
enraged at the stubborn gentility of september he roars 
whos he to be in charge of a roadhouse when im out of work 
everywhere you go all you see is black faces bus drivers bank 
tellers bloody threepiece suits man 
apartheid says slabolepszy comes from the soul of that kind 
of character it comes from fear its a fear of being swamped 
this character vince has i think the central line of the 
film when he says my old man said if you let a black man get 
the better of you thats the end youre finished theres no 
going back thats his belief 
this is a heady time for slabolepszy and others in south 
africas artistic community a series of hit plays have emerged 
from johannesburg master harold and the boys 
sarafina woza albert among others south african music 
has become an international rage and there is an emergence of black 
south african art and literature 
history is happening said slabolepszy who yearns to 
someday make a picture of hope perhaps he muses there will 
be a happy accident in south africa in the meantime he finds 
his drama in turmoil

the seedy digs of old moldovanka home 
for most of the century to crime bosses and legendary tales of 
banditry have been razed and replaced by mournful rows of standard 
gray soviet apartments 
italian street where genoa merchants built grand homes in the 
last century is now named for russian poet alexander pushkin the 
crumbling mansions house state museums and foreign tourists 
languid clerks dole out sugary fruit juice in the bars along the 
black sea waterfront where sailors and stevedores drank and 
brawled for 150 years 
the body of old odessa is decaying and neglected but looks are 
deceiving the soul of the ukrainian city known as the mama of 
dealers drifters and orphans in the 1920s still spills vice from 
darkened recesses into the open marketplace 
you can get anything at the weekend markets foreign 
currency liquor drugs even prostitutes said yuri a 
32yearold black marketeer who keeps his thumbnails long to aid in 
dispensing cocaine 
teenagers in jean jackets and designer sweat shirts bought on 
the black market flood a slotmachine parlor at the boat terminal 
heavily rouged prostitutes in leather skirts approach foreign 
sailors and wellheeled locals entering the international merchant 
marine club on rosa luxemburg street shellgame swindlers 
clustered around the privoz the central market grounds draw 
circles of suckers supporters and ringers 
three young men encountered during a stroll under the chestnut 
trees of deribasovskaya street say their city is safer now in the 
past when their mothers and grandmothers were afraid to walk alone 
after dark 
but everything is still for sale here observed one of the 
sportily dressed students odessans are just natural 
businessmen 
housewives out for their daily shopping brazenly approach 
foreign tourists to inquire whether they have jeans cosmetics or 
anything else to sell 
the staterun press says odessa is the door through which most 
contraband enters the soviet union and city officials reluctantly 
concede it is true 
deputy mayor galina izuvita blames lax security in checking the 
cargo of incoming ships in this respect we are envious of cities 
that do not have ports through which drugs can enter ms izuvita 
said 
port manager nikolai pavliuk who has worked in the harbor for 
28 years counters never has anyone been found to have taken 
part in illegal transit of contraband 
but to sasha a 30yearold construction worker and drug dealer 
odessa is still mama 
at a darkened cafe sasha surreptitiously gulped cognac from a 
coffee cup and fanned a wad of several thousand rubles to show that 
the benefits of trading currencies and narcotics far exceed the 230 
rubles 387 a month he earns from his legitimate job 
organized crime networks fed by smuggled goods flourished in 
mama odessa in the chaos that followed the destruction of the 
port during russias civil war 
writer isaac babel had but to change a few names to pass city 
life for fiction mobster benny krik the likeable hero of the 
odessa tales was modeled after odessas mishka the japanese 
but stalins terror suppressed the mobs and 70 years of 
socialism have rebuilt the port housed the orphans and more 
recently shut down the obvious dens of iniquity 
official efforts to tame odessas anythinggoes spirit have 
pasted a veneer of respectability over the city youth clubs and 
dance halls now occupy vacated bars and liquor shops 
the authorities launch periodic anticorruption drives but a 
steady influx of contraband has kept the black markets alive and 
cleanup campaigns are usually shortlived 
gypsy fortunetellers cast a wary eye around each club or cafe 
before whispering to a patron at the low wooden tables that the 
secrets of the future can be had for two rubles 340 
many of the citys elegant old buildings were closed or 
demolished during a building and refurbishing binge but a glimpse 
of odessas lost grandeur is still visible above the colorless 
facades and cloudy store windows on deribasovskaya street 
three or four stories above metal store signs with unimaginative 
names like shoes womens clothing and sundries 
rooftops sport disintegrating cupolas and cornices and leaded 
windows from which most of the glass has fallen out 
a renovation plan begun five years ago touched off a campaign to 
preserve odessas landmarks and in early april chief architect 
vasily mironenko was fired after proposing to cut down the famed 
chestnut trees along primorsky boulevard overlooking the port 
many odessans oppose their citys changing appearance 
a cab driver traveling through the renovated moldavanka 
neighborhood contended there is an official plot in the soviet 
capital to force odessa into the moscow mold 
odessa is not a phenomenon anymore he said its just a 
town 
the driver was quoting odessa writer mikhail shvanetsky who 
said the same about the city in the underground literature he 
circulated in the 1970s

all three sons were on their best 
behavior homemade berry liqueur had been poured neatly into seven 
tiny glasses and the table was resplendent with carefully crafted 
ors doeuvres of salted fish canned meats and pickled vegetables 
olga chuikov wife mother economist and communist party 
activist beamed with pride over the table spread lavishly for her 
family and the three strangers her friend lena invited for dinner 
with only a few hours warning 
smoothing the skirt of her crimson knit dress and nervously 
touching the cluster of curls neatly pinned on the crown of her 
head olga raised her glass 
what should we drink to asked the hostess searching her 
family and guests with expectant brown eyes theres so much we 
are hoping for its difficult to decide 
her neighbors and coworkers probably would say olga has 
everything she and viktor her husband of 15 years have a healthy 
family a fourroom apartment a red neva car and a summer cottage 
in the country they are as successful and thriving in soviet 
society as were ozzie and harriet or the cleavers the television 
families that celebrated american life in the 1960s 
a westerner like the american journalist brought over by olgas 
friend party secretary lena ivankovich might have guessed that 
olga hoped for material things a washing machine stereo or 
fashionable pair of shoes 
but the hostess a slender and attractive woman in her mid30s 
raised her glass and wished for her sons to grow up seeing 
americans as friends not enemies for the two governments to stop 
posturing and get down to the business of disarmament for a 
peaceful and wholesome future for her family 
so began a long night of storytelling and exploration that would 
teach the chuikovs about american lifestyles and give the american 
a glimpse of the concerns and values of a patriotic and 
hardworking siberian family 
olgas and viktors curiosity spills out in a flood of questions 
about everyday life in a land theyve always heard about but 
probably will never see 
i know our media often give a negative picture of life in 
america olga began diplomatically how do americans see us 
is it true that they think we are an aggressive society 
the level in the liqueur bottle dropped as the debate and 
laughter escalated and viktor produced a bottle of armenian cognac 
to sustain the conviviality into the early hours of morning the 
boys were told to go to bed but they stalled in the corners and 
doorways of the room fascinated by the exchange of lifestyle 
trivia 
how much does an american journalist earn each month how much 
does it cost for an apartment why do americans say disrespectful 
things about their president do the homeless and unemployed 
literally starve on the street or are there places where they can 
get help 
the questions themselves tell a lot about soviet life personal 
finances are as popular a subject of discussion as the weather and 
soviets dont hesitate to ask questions about salary savings or 
debt 
the chuikovs olga viktor the boys and olgas father vasily 
are comparatively well off for a soviet family together they 
have an income of more than 800 rubles a month about 1350 that 
is four times the wage of an average industrial worker and their 
apartment in the center of this siberian boomtown is spacious by 
any soviet standard 
living space is in extremely short supply and is distributed to 
families usually for life with the right to pass on an apartment 
as inheritance its not unusual for a family of four to be housed 
in a one or tworoom apartment and many rooms in soviet 
households serve as dining room living room and bedroom as the day 
progresses 
soviets pay about 3 percent of their salary for rent with the 
location and size of the living space playing little part in the 
pricing system 
the chuikovs were surprised to learn americans usually pay about 
one quarter of their monthly income for housing but they were even 
more intrigued that most middleclass working people live in 
separate homes rather than in apartments and that homes and 
apartments sometimes stand empty for months for want of a tenant or 
buyer 
suburban living perplexed them since homes on the outskirts of 
a city lack prestige in the soviet union even in the major cities 
the outer areas are seldom connected to municipal water heating or 
sewer systems outhouses and treks to community wells are daily 
facts of life within five miles of the moscow city limits 
food costs account for a greater share of the soviet familys 
budget than for americans the chuikovs calculated they were 
tickled by the concept of sprawling grocery stores where it takes 
an entire aisle to display all the different brands of coffee or 
breakfast cereal 
you just cant buy these things here olga said we built 
up our heavy industries after the war putting out farm equipment 
and industrial machines by the ton but we havent paid much 
attention to the things we need in everyday life 
the tugs of career and homemaking are felt by parents in both 
nations the women agreed with viktor and his male guests 
grudgingly conceding that the lot of the soviet working mother is a 
tough one 
does your husband cook for himself and shop for food olga 
wanted to know casting a reproving look at her husband 
soviet homes are devoid of the gadgets that get the american 
cook through a meal or the weekly laundry olga and lena are well 
educated and well read and had heard of microwave ovens but they 
shook their heads in wonder when told refrigerated leftovers could 
be reheated in five minutes 
free time and priorities for spending it further underscored 
differences between the two lifestyles soviet women spend an 
average of eight hours a day waiting in lines to buy food and 
performing the household chores still shunned by most men 
tynda however is spared much of the queuing that eats up spare 
time in other cities as the remote siberian base from which the 
baikalamur railroad is pushing east the town must truck in 
virtually everything it needs theres no need to search each 
store cabbage or an electric iron is either available or its not 
soviets generally are more culturally inclined than most 
americans standing in line for hours or cashing in on past favors 
to get tickets to the theater or symphony every book is a 
cherished possession and television is something they turn to for 
news rather than entertainment perhaps because programming is 
repetitive and of low quality 
as a mother i have to say i dont understand how americans can 
condone violence and antisovietism in films that children can 
see olga said how does this constitute freedom of speech 
rambo and rocky iv drew the traditional denunciations from the 
six adult soviets although none had seen either of the films 
the chuikovs said their 13yearold twins spend many 
afterschool hours in sports but that the shortage of consumer 
services that plagues most of the country is especially hard on 
siberians 
there are not enough music teachers so they can take only the 
most talented and unfortunately none of my children has 
distinguished himself olga lamented but all the same id 
like them to be musically literate 
school and work loomed only a few hours in the future so the 
smallscale cultural exchange drew to a reluctant close 
we hope we didnt tire you with so many questions olga 
said its just such a rare treat to see america through an 
americans eyes

twenty years ago last month hair brought 
the age of aquarius to broadway and the american musical theater 
was never quite the same 
the show with its contemporary sound and freewheeling almost 
nonexistent book ran for more than 1700 performances spawning 
countless touring and foreign companies as well as a successful 
movie now it is back in new york for one night only this time in 
a unique concert version at the united nations that will be a 
benefit for children with aids 
the concert to be held may 26 at the un general assembly 
hall will reunite the musicals creators james rado jerome 
ragni and galt macdermot as well as many performers who appeared 
in various companies of hair or the film version

macrae treat williams nell carter andre de shields and donna 
summer among the other performers scheduled to appear are bea 
arthur frank stallone jay leno rex smith and chuck mangione as 
well as a large cast of young unknown singers 
after 20 years the anniversary came up and we said what are 
we doing to do with it ragni said the other day people told 
us to do a big reunion of hair kids and make it just a hair 
celebration we didnt want to do that in a way hair was always 
used as a rallying point 
they found a new rallying point in the plight of children with 
aids and the money raised from the concert ticket prices are 
scaled from 250 to 5000 will go to the united states committee 
for unicef and the creo societys fund for children with aids 
hair was the most influential of the rock musicals that hit 
broadway and offbroadway during the late 1960s and early 70s 
more than any other rock show it integrated te pop music sound of 
the day into the broadway musical 
tim rice lyricist for such hairinspired musicals as 
jesus christ superstar and evita calls it one of the 
best broadway scores ever written

rado and ragni were in the cast rado played a young man named 
claude who was about to be drafted and spends his remaining free 
hours with a tribe of firstspirited individuals on the outskirts 
of conventional society 
when the show is done today and it still has revivals around 
the country its done as a period piece rado says 
theres nothing from that era that really showed what went on 
with the hippie movement what that time was about ragni said 
it touched on the antiwar movement racism the ecology movement 
and a lot of other things all this was going on at the same time 
the title of the concert is hair for the next 
generation and for the show the trio has composed 18 new songs 
including several with such titles as plant love ozone and 
sweet american that sound like they will fit right into the 
show twelve of the new numbers will be used in the concert as well 
as most of the original songs 
we thought what would hair be like now so we wrote 
those kinds of songs said ragni whats the difference between 
now and then 
the children of today are ready to embrace this show again its 
creators say and the concert may be the first step toward a new 
edition of the show that may play the west coast and work its way 
east 
there is such a revival of the 60s going on right now 
ragni said what was that era about a lot of them are asking 
these kids are wondering what their parents were like or what 
the kids in those days were like said rado this show still 
gives them a good idea

what is lacking is democracy where 
the people no longer are tricked where there are no monopolies of 
any kind particularly when the monopoly opens the door to 
electoral fraud presidential candidate manuel j clouthier was 
saying 
we are fighting all of this and we are going to win 
we is the national action party which has put up the 
staunchest opposition to mexicos longdominant institutional 
revolutionary party pri which has won every election since its 
inception in 1929 
but national action known as pan has been making deeper 
inroads against pri in northern mexico in recent years and now 
believes it has a better chance than ever to come away with an 
upset in the presidential election july 6 
the 53yearold clouthier a prosperous agricultural 
businessman made his point about winning in an interview with the 
associated press while on a campaign swing through the northwestern 
border state of northern baja california 
he has visited more than 70 cities and towns across mexico in 
his campaign and has sought to portray himself and pan as a 
freemarket alternative to pris political and economic 
centralization 
we are the only real option for change because we are rabidly 
democratic because we want democracy politically economically 
culturally clouthier said we are not in favor of government 
control of the economy we represent a social market economy 
national action is strong in northern mexico but it has never 
been able to build a national base to challenge the pri whose 
presidential candidate is carlos salinas de gortari 
i see that the people of mexico are more disposed to change 
things clouthier said of conditions now they have been 
repressed but are ready to fight once more for the change that they 
yearn for 
our way is distinct the state monopoly is not concerned with 
initiative because it sacrifices everything for the sake of 
control 
maquio as clouthier is popularly known places 
responsibility for mexicos economic troubles on salinas de 
gortari who had served as budget and planning secretary under the 
incumbent president miguel de la madrid 
clouthier supports private enterprise more government 
austerity greater foreign investment and allowing peasants to own 
the land they now are allowed to use and pass on to their children 
but not sell 
for years national action was the only significant opposition to 
the pri but the economic difficulties that have lasted throughout 
de la madrids administration have allowed clouthier and four other 
minority candidates to take a more vocal and visible role this year 
pan cast as a conservative opposition group has strong support 
from business and the roman catholic church hierarchy 
clouthier running on a program for economic construction 
contends that corruption has played an important part in mexicos 
economic crisis 
regarding the foreign debt the majority of which the 
government contracted on the shoulders of the people i would first 
seize the goods of the public officials who have enriched 
themselves he said in the interview 
mexicos foreign debt of 105 billion is the second largest in 
the developing world after brazils 
clouthier favors the return of the mexican banking system to the 
private sector 
since the banks have been ours there has been no credit for 
the campesino peasant he said 
the government of president jose lopez portillo nationalized the 
banks in september 1982 at the outset of the economic crisis 
brought on by falling oil prices 
pan was the runnerup in the 1982 presidential race with 158 
percent of votes against 709 percent for de la madrid

vice president george bush who already has 
the republican nomination virtually wrapped up easily won idahos 
republican presidential primary on tuesday while michael dukakis 
cruised to an overwhelming victory in the democrats nonbinding 
vote 
with 24 percent of the precincts reporting bush had 81 percent 
of the vote to 10 percent for pat robertson who is no longer an 
active contender dukakis was pulling in 77 percent to 14 percent 
for jesse jackson sens albert gore jr and paul simon both of 
whom have suspended their democratic presidential campaigns were 
getting 3 percent each 
bush was winning 15 of the 18 national convention delegates at 
stake in the lackluster primary with two going to robertson and 
one in the uncommitted column the democratic vote was purely a 
beauty contest exercise frontrunner dukakis claimed a 
majority of the delegates at caucuses two months ago 
with no statewide elected offices at stake this year and the 
presidential candidates all but formally crowned there was little 
to draw idaho voters to the polls beyond a handful of heated 
legislative and local races only about one in three registered 
voters were expected to cast ballots 
for various reasons the presidential election and others 
neither we nor the county clerks are seeing very much intensity in 
this one deputy secretary of state ben ysursa said 
on the republican side robertson remained on the ballot as a 
challenge to the vice president although he suspended his candidacy 
earlier this month and returned to his christian broadcasting 
network 
bush made a 19hour campaign swing through idaho earlier this 
month to bolster his support in a state that has not given its four 
electoral votes to a democrat since lyndon johnson in 1964 
on the democratic side where no delegates were at stake the 
massachusetts governor was expected to easily win the nonbinding 
preference vote over jackson 
democrats allotted 18 of their 24 nominating delegates in super 
tuesday caucuses held on march 8 dukakis captured eight of them 
jackson four and six were uncommitted 
since then however gov cecil andrus one of the six 
previously uncommitted super delegates has endorsed dukakis 
and urged others to do the same so the party is clearly unified for 
the november assault on the white house 
although there has been no statewide polling conducted a 
democratic poll this spring in the conservative 2nd congressional 
district of southern idaho showed dukakis only 2 percentage points 
behind bush 
but its a long time to the finish line said state senate 
president pro tem james risch of boise bushs state chairman 
the people will have a choice between a person who knows the 
issues and a governor of a state that really hasnt done very 
well 
former gov john evans the state chairman for dukakis saw the 
poll giving bush 44 percent and dukakis 42 percent as an indication 
democrats have a chance in idaho this year 
people are looking for a new leader evans said

this years value of us agriculture exports 
to the soviet union is expected to climb 50 percent to a threeyear 
high of 14 billion according to agriculture department 
economists 
behind the gain will be much larger wheat shipments at higher 
prices and much bigger soybean and soybean meal sales the 
departments economic research service said monday 
farm product sales to the soviets exceeded 19 billion in 1985 
but plummeted to a 13yearlow of 658 million in 1986 before 
rebounding to 938 million in calendar 1987 
a major factor has been large sales of us wheat at subsidized 
prices under the departments export enhancement program 
the us value share of soviet grain imports may be above 30 
percent for the first time since 1984 and may comprise over 8 
percent of total agricultural imports the report said 
although total soviet agricultural imports may increase 5 
percent in 1988 from last years estimated 16 billion the value 
will still be below the 19 billion average during the first half 
of the 1980s 
grain imports now cost about 3 billion a year instead of 7 
billion as in 198185 the report said despite a possible 20 
percent rise in the perton cost of imported grain in 1988 this 
unit value will still be around onethird lower in the early 
1980s 
kathryn zeimetz chief author of the report said the forecast 
of 14 billion this year is still far below the 29 billion in 
the value of us agricultural sales to the soviets in 1984 the 
standing record is 3 billion in 1979 she said 
earlier this month the usda forecast 1988 grain output at 215 
million metric tons up 2 percent from last year it also would be 
the third consecutive harvest of more than 200 million tons a 
historic first for the soviet union 
crops are off to a much better start than in 1987 following a 
good fall sowing overwintering and spring planting conditions 
mondays analysis said barring unusually severe weather through 
the spring and fall 1988 crop output should increase 
greater output and improved productivity in agriculture are 
prerequisites for improvement in the soviet economy 
the agroindustrial complex accounts for more than 30 percent 
of the gross social product 70 percent of the retail trade sales 
and onethird of the productive capital and work force the 
report said

a proposed change in agriculture department 
regulations would hold farmers and others in the marketing chain 
financially accountable for livestock carcasses condemned at 
slaughter plants because of illegally high traces of drugs 
bh bill jones administrator of the departments packers 
and stockyards administration said monday the proposal is intended 
to deter the sale of medicated animals for slaughter and shift 
economic responsibility for illegal drug residues from the meat 
packer to those who cause the violation 
under the proposal a meat packer would be able to bill back 
the person from whom the livestock was bought if it is condemned 
because of illegal drug residues 
in order to make the plan work jones said each purchaser or 
selling agency in the marketing chain would be permitted to use the 
billback procedure if a seller failed to settle up the buyer or 
selling agency would be permitted to deduct from a subsequent 
purchase from the same person 
jones said that although a small percentage of livestock 
producers are selling medicated animals for slaughter the 
illegally high drug residues continue to be a problem notably in 
swine culled dairy cows and young calves 
the proposal will be open 60 days for public comment those can 
be sent to packers and stockyards administration room 3039s

an additional 3375367 acres of highly 
erodible cropland will be taken from production under the 
agriculture departments 10year conservation reserve program 
milton hertz administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation program said monday the acreage was 
accepted from offers or bids during the programs sixth signup 
held feb 119 a total of about 45 million acres was offered 
during the signup 
in all counting the earlier signups more than 255 million 
acres have been accepted into the program he said another signup 
will be held july 18 through aug 5 
congress in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 
million acres for the program by 1990 
under the program farmers agree to take land from production 
for 10 years in return based on bids they submit they get annual 
rental payments from the government and onetime assistance pay for 
half the cost of planting grass trees and shrubs to guard against 
erosion 
hertz said the bids accepted from the latest signup averaged 
4790 per acre annually compared with 4845 for the first five 
signups

the average number of days patients spent in 
hospitals declined between 11 percent and 15 percent in the early 
1980s a researcher for the department of health and human services 
said tuesday 
the decline has reduced health care costs for individuals the 
government and insurers but in a sense theres a false sense of 
savings said dean farley the deputy research manager of the 
hospital studies program in the national center for health services 
research and health care technology assessment 
hospitals are reducing their costs insurers and the 
government are saving money but patients still need nursing care 
and they usually get it from family members said farley 
according to the study the average hospital stay declined from 
735 days in 1980 to 571 days in 1985 according to the new york 
times which reported on the study in wednesdays editions 
farley said the decline has occurred despite the fact that 
hospitals are tending to admit patients who are sicker and who 
therefore stay longer but for some specific medical conditions 
the length of stay has been shortened he said 
for example women admitted for normal delivery of babies used 
to stay in the hospital three to five days but its not unusual 
now to find women being discharged one or two days following 
delivery he said 
the decline has been very substantial and what has happened is 
that people who once were admitted for relatively short stays 
arent getting into the hospitals said farley instead he said 
they are treated on an outpatient basis 
the study attributed the decline in hospital stays to several 
factors he said they include changes in reimbursement by 
government insurance programs like medicare a shift towards 
outpatient care increased use of second opinions and utilization 
review changes in the ways hospitals are competing for patients 
growth in health maintenance organizations and other prepaid 
insurances and selective contracting on the part of insurers 
who are shopping around among hospitals on the basis of costs 
farley said hospitals reacted to policies put in place by 
insurers and public agencies that believed hospital usage was 
excessive 
however following such policies is now presenting a problem for 
hospitals he said 
its not unusual to have them operating at 50 to 60 percent on 
average farley said he said the decline may be contributing to 
some hospital closings 
the state of maryland was actively discussing about a year and 
a half to two years ago how to eliminate 20 percent of the hospital 
beds in the state he said i think those kinds of discussions 
are taking place all over the country the real challenge is 
what to do with that excess 
farley said the decline is leveling off 
lengths of stay have fallen as much as they are going to for 
awhile but there are some questions in terms of caseloads and the 
kinds of patients that they are going to treat he said 
the study did not look at how hospitals are coping with the 
declining stays of patients but the next question is what they 
can afford to do whether a decline like this will leave the 
hospitals financial capable

the supreme court says it will tell states 
whether they may combat child pornography with laws so restrictive 
that parents could be prosecuted for taking pictures of their naked 
infants 
the court agreed monday to consider reinstating a massachusetts 
law struck down by that states highest court as too broad a 
restriction on freespeech rights 
a decision is expected from the justices sometime next year 
the massachusetts supreme judicial court threw out the criminal 
prosecution in worcester county of douglas oakes who had been 
convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for soliciting a 
child to pose for pornographic purposes 
prosecutors said oakes in 1984 induced his 14yearold 
stepdaughter to pose for photographs taken in their home while she 
was clothed only in bikini underpants 
police were contacted after the girls mother discovered the 
photographs 
when oakes appealed the states highest court voted 43 to 
overturn his conviction and dismiss the criminal indictment 
the state court said photography is a form of expression 
entitled to the constitutions freespeech protections it said the 
state could interfere with such expression only to serve an 
important governmental purpose and that the interference had to be 
narrowly drawn to serve that purpose 
the massachusetts court noted that the challenged law makes a 
criminal of a parent who takes a frontalview picture of his or her 
naked 1yearold running on a beach or romping in a wading pool 
the state courts three dissenters however said oakes taking 
photographs of his stepdaughter represented conduct not a form of 
expression 
they said the narrowly drawn requirement traditionally 
imposed in challenges to laws having an impact on freedom of 
expression should not apply 
in the appeal acted on monday massachusetts attorney general 
james m shannon relied heavily on a 1982 supreme court decision 
that excluded child pornography from freespeech protections 
he said the 1982 ruling established that states are entitled 
to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of 
children than might be appropriate in other contexts 
shannon called the prosecution of a parent for taking pictures 
of very young naked children unlikely adding it is 
noteworthy in this regard that not a single application of the 
statute to this type of situation has ever been presented 
the attorney general said oakes taking sexually suggestive 
nude photographs of his 14yearold stepdaughter in secret is 
conduct which the commonwealth could properly criminalize 
in other matters the court 
gave trial judges broad power to deny criminal defendants the 
lawyer of their choice if a possible conflict of interest exists 
the court 54 upheld the narcoticstrafficking conspiracy 
conviction of a california man denied the lawyer of his choice even 
though he was willing to waive his right to conflictfree legal 
help 
gave states by a 62 vote in an ohio case some authority to 
enforce safety codes at federal nuclear production facilities for 
hazards unrelated to radiation

classes resumed at hubbard woods 
elementary school on tuesday for the first time since laurie danns 
murderous rampage and authorities stepped up their efforts to 
learn how ms dann despite erratic and often threatening behavior 
was always one step ahead of the law 
ms dann stormed the school friday and fired on pupils in a 
secondgrade classroom fatally wounding an 8yearold boy and 
injuring five other children she wounded a seventh person at a 
nearby house where she barricaded herself before taking her own 
life 
sgt gene kalvaitis spokesman for winnetka police chief herbert 
timm said that investigators were dispatched tuesday to madison 
wis and tucson ariz to gain more information about ms danns 
motivation 
a task force made up of neighboring police departments and the 
cook county sheriffs police has begun reviewing ms danns 
repeated runins with authorities during the past three years 
its not an unheardof situation said kalvaitis five or 
six of the police departments in this area had contact with her 
before but none of them knew that 
and the information that should be centered somewhere and 
available to every department never gets to one location he 
added thats one thing we hope bringing our departments together 
for this investigative effort is going to solve 
in madison vials containing mysterious substances library 
catalog cards on books about poisons and a laboratory smock were 
found in an apartment ms dann had rented since january said fbi 
agent kent miller winnekta police were expected to analyze the 
vials contents he said 
in tucson the investigators were to interview a onetime 
boyfriend of ms danns to whom she had recently made death threats 
the feeling is if we understand her motivation we might be 
able to stop something like this from happening in the future 
said kalvaitis 
classes were held at the school for the first time tuesday 
where children returned with a businessasusual attitude said 
principal richard streedain 
administrators said the children displayed surprising maturity 
at meetings over the weekend to discuss the tragedy and during a 
memorial service monday for 8yearold classmate nicholas corwin 
six persons wounded in fridays rampage were still hospitalized 
tuesday one of them in critical condition 
by tuesday law enforcement agencies had recovered 21 packages 
of poisoned food and beverages ms dann apparently delivered to 
acquaintances or former employers before fridays shootings no one 
has been seriously harmed by the tainted food 
kalvaitis said authorities also learned tuesday that ms dann 
mailed three additional packages friday morning two to madison 
wis which authorities now have and a third to california 
the only thing i can say right now about the california 
package right now is that its been mailed i cant say if we know 
where and to whom he said 
kalvaitis also said authorities were awaiting the results of 
toxicology tests to complete the autopsy on ms dann 
over the past three years ms dann was a suspect in the 
icepick stabbing of her exhusband accused of stealing food and 
clothing from homes where she worked as a baby sitter and arrested 
for shoplifting in madison 
ms dann also was accused of making death threats to a number of 
people most recently to the former college boyfriend who is now a 
doctor in tucson 
in a may 9 conversation recorded by authorities ms dann said 
she would kill the doctor and his family and make it look like 
the doctors wife did it said pima ariz county deputy 
attorney lou spivack 
janet johnson the federal prosecutor assigned to the case said 
in a telephone interview from tucson that she planned to seek an 
indictment but delayed doing so because we wanted to go forward 
in more than one jurisdiction 
the doctor was worried that if we couldnt arrange to have her 
held without bond that she might get out and fixate on him even 
further she said 
ms johnsons office had arranged for fbi agents may 13 to go 
speak to ms dann in madison where she had lived since january 
they were unsuccessful in finding her on that date as well as 
during a second visit may 15 just five days before she went on 
the shooting spree

even for veterans of white house bureaucratic 
battles the competition to go to moscow for next weeks historic 
ussoviet summit is intense 
is there a lot of interest in the trip the answer is yes 
said thomas c griscom the assistant to the president for 
communications and planning griscom and colin l powell reagans 
national security adviser chair a summit planning group 
besides interest there are hurt feelings from the state 
department in foggy bottom to the white house at 1600 pennsylvania 
avenue over whos going to the summit and whos not officials say 
we really need to restrict the numbers and you have to start 
at home so you have to make cuts within your own operation 
griscom said among the casualties karen fuller griscoms 
executive assistant 
even so 800 people from arms control negotiators to white 
house stewards will be part of the presidents entourage griscom 
said that number includes 275 members of the white house press 
corps the four television networks abc cbs nbc and cable news 
network also are expected to each have as many as 150 people 
flying in separately to the soviet union 
with the presidents eightyear term nearing an end the may 
29june 2 summit is one of the last and possibly the most 
spectacular overseas extravaganzas to be staged by the reagan 
white house 
the moscow leg of the trip the first visit by a us president 
to the soviet union in 14 years is preceded by three days in 
helsinki finland and followed by a stop in london 
reagan and his wife nancy will be joined by key members of the 
cabinet including secretary of state george p shultz and defense 
secretary frank c carlucci also joining the traveling party are 
white house chief of staff howard baker and us information agency 
director charles z wick besides mrs reagan mrs shultz is the 
only wife traveling with her husband 
rozanne l ridgway the assistant secretary of state for 
european and canadian affairs who has participated in many 
negotiations with the soviets will play a key role in the summit 
as will members of the arms control and disarmament agency 
its a wonderful finale said ambassador selwa roosevelt 
the chief of protocol i cant think of a more appropriate way to 
come to the concluding months of the presidents term 
mrs roosevelts office is helping linda faulkner the white 
house social secretary prepare for the enormous project in 
moscow which includes a dinner party the reagans will host for the 
gorbachevs at spaso house the ambassadors residence in moscow 
american food and california wines will be flown in for the 
evening with entertainment by jazz pianist dave brubeck 
among the other events reagans visit to historic danilov 
monastery one meeting with dissidents and another with soviet 
writers and artists a speech at moscow university a state dinner 
hosted by the gorbachevs in the hall of facets at the kremlin mrs 
reagans trip to leningrad and a performance at the bolshoi 
theater 
primarily because of security the number of americans attending 
the summit is larger than normally would attend a meeting such as 
the annual economic summit which is being held june 1921 in 
toronto canada 
when you are having a meeting in moscow you really have to 
take extraordinary security precautions precautions you would 
ordinarily not have to take in tokyo or london said robert e 
lamb the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security 
but the state departments budget cuts mean the agency may send 
fewer people to moscow than it did to reagans first superpower 
summit in geneva in november 1985 said one official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
diplomats and white house aides will be joined in moscow by 
engineers technicians guards cooks stewards and support staff 
the us embassy in moscow differs from most embassies where 
foreign nationals cook clean answer telephones make repairs and 
run errands for the diplomats and their families in october 1986 
260 soviets were removed from the embassy as part of a series of 
diplomatic expulsions between washington and moscow 
to compensate for the shortstaffing in moscow the us 
government will send people to help out at the embassy and at spaso 
house lambs staff has sent technicians to assure secure rooms 
inside the embassy as well as additional american guards to keep a 
24houraday watch on the facilities he said

the reagan administration is now facing 
protests from exiled panamanian president eric arturo delvalle for 
its handling of negotiations to get gen manuel antonio noriega to 
resign 
at the same time the administration is displaying weariness 
with the prolonged negotiating process and said it hopes an 
agreement can be reached before president reagan leaves wednesday 
for the moscow summit 
in a statement issued monday from hiding delvalle and his 
allies said the negotiations with noriega as reported in the 
media would mortgage the future of panama for a long time to 
come 
the statement was issued through the prodelvalle panamanian 
embassy in washington by delvalle and panamas democratic 
forces 
the administations chief panama negotiator michael g kozak 
was ordered back to panama late sunday by the white house to 
continue negotiations with noriega even though vice president 
george bush has counseled against any dealings with drug dealers 
whether foreign or domestic 
delvalle was forced out of office after he tried to fire noriega 
as head of the panamanian defense forces delvalle continues to 
receive us backing as the legitimate president of panama but the 
statement indicated he believes the administration has made too 
many concessions in its negotiations with noriega 
it said noriega would be able to to continue to exercise 
authority even after resigning as defense chief unless the defense 
forces are revamped 
us officials who have described the negotiating process have 
not suggested that a major overhaul of the defense forces is 
contemplated 
the embassy statement also demanded the immediate exit of 
noriega from panama suggesting unhappiness with the august 
departure date now planned 
the us officials have said that as foreseen in the 
negotiations noriega would leave panama in august and return after 
the may 1989 presidential elections they said noriega would have a 
hand in the selection of an interim government which would serve 
until after the elected government takes office 
the embassy statement called for delvalles reinstatment as 
president and for the formation of a government of national 
reconciliation 
noriega the de facto panamanian ruler who is under 
drugsmuggling indictments in the united states has successfully 
resisted prolonged us pressure to force him out 
there is a sharp division within the administration over what 
kind of deal noriega should be offered and particularly whether 
the government should go ahead with an offer to drop the drug 
charges 
reagan said nothing had been settled and that there was not a 
timetable for concluding a deal but under secretary of state 
michael armacost said it would be desirable to reach a settlement 
before reagans departure for finland on wednesday he is due in 
moscow on sunday 
reagan asked whether he was prepared to drop the drug charges 
against the panamanian general said nothings been settled 
its still in the works 
kozak the deputy assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs spent the weekend in washington after 
nearly a month of negotiations in panama kozak briefed reagan and 
other highlevel officials and returned to panama monday morning 
state department spokesman charles redman said kozak is 
prepared to continue discussions

the first national standards on who can 
operate a train and other steps strengthening the governments 
hand for dealing with railroad accidents are awaiting final 
congressional approval 
the house approved the legislation by voice vote monday and sent 
it to the senate where approval is expected this week 
the measure is an outgrowth of the jan 4 1987 collision of an 
amtrak passenger train with three connected conrail locomotives in 
chase md the crash killed 16 people and injured 175 others two 
of the conrail crewmen admitted later that they had been smoking 
marijuana in the cab 
the legislation does not include a requirement for the mandatory 
random testing of railroad workers which is strongly opposed by 
rail unions that language is part of another bill that is mired 
down by differences between the house and senate 
it does order the transportation department to set up a national 
system for licensing train engineers give the government the power 
to penalize individual workers not just railroad companies for 
safety violations and increase the federal fines that can be 
imposed 
the bills passage brought mixed reactions from railroad and 
labor union officials 
william h dempsey president of the association of american 
railroads praised parts of the measure but said it also should 
have required mandatory random drug testing of railroad workers 
it cannot be said that the bill adequately addresses the 
issue of rail safety without that language dempsey said in a 
written statement 
james kennedy executive secretarytreasurer of the railway 
labor executives association said parts of the bill were good but 
added that it should have raised fines further and offered more 
protections for employees who report workplace problems 
it certainly doesnt go far enough said kennedy whose 
organization represents 300000 railroad workers 
under the licensing program applicants automobile driving 
licenses would be examined for drug and alcohol convictions an 
individual whose record shows such convictions could receive an 
engineers license only if he or she had completed an approved 
rehabilitation program 
the bill also requires the transportation department to issue 
rules forbidding the disabling of safety devices a practice that 
is not now illegal 
instruments to record a trains operating data similar to 
black boxes in aircraft would be required within three years 
and automatic braking devices common on amtrak trains but missing 
on many freight trains would be required in the busy northeast 
corridor 
the maximum civil fine imposed for safety violations would be 
increased from 2500 to 20000 for grossly negligent breaches of 
the law 
this legislation takes a significant new stride in enhancing 
safety said john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee which originated the bill 
the house and senate each had approved earlier versions of the 
legislation negotiators from the two chambers agreed last thursday 
to the compromise bill

the cervical cap a birth control device that 
works something like a diaphragm has won food and drug 
administration approval for prescription in the united states 
it already is widely used in britain and other countries and has 
been tried by about 50000 us women in clinical trials sponsored 
by the national institutes of health 
the cap approved monday is a flexible cuplike rubber device 
about 1 inches in diameter that is to be fitted by a physician to 
cover the base of the womans cervix 
after the initial fitting the cap can be inserted and removed 
by the user and can remain in place for 48 hours as opposed to a 
maximum of 12 hours for the diaphragm 
both devices are to be used with a spermicidal cream or jelly 
but the cap does not require additional spermicide before each 
instance of intercourse 
the nih clinical study found the cap to be about 85 percent 
effective in preventing pregnancy comparable to the diaphragm 
the approved labeling to be supplied physicians states the cap 
is to be prescribed only for women with normal pap tests which is 
a test for cervical cancer and that they are to return for a 
followup pap test after using the cap for three months 
the labeling also will caution that the cap like the diaphragm 
and contraceptive sponge may slightly increase the risk of toxic 
shock syndrome 
unlike the diaphragm the cervical cap was not widely used in 
the united states in 1977 when congress ordered the fda to 
strengthen its regulation of birth control and other medical 
devices 
because they were already in extensive use at that time 
diaphragms and condoms were given grandfather fda approval time 
without the stringent testing subsequently required of new medical 
devices 
the national womens health network an advocacy group has been 
pushing for approval of the cap since 1978 arguing that it is as 
safe and effective as the diaphragm and offers advantages that many 
women will find appealing 
rather than covering the entire roof of the vagina as a 
diaphragm does the cap fits over the tip of the cervix and thus 
allows for more sensitivity during intercourse

the governments nationwide case against 
members of the hells angels could be jeopardized by a mistrial 
declared in one case after a disclosure that the chief informant 
lied about his history of cocaine use 
informant anthony tait had testified that he took cocaine twice 
in his life and also used marijuana but stopped because they made 
me violently ill 
us district judge robert schnacke on monday declared a 
mistrial in the case of michael lessard 39 a member of the 
motorcycle gangs oakland chapter after learning tait admitted to 
the fbi in 1985 that he had been a regular cocaine user 
lessard is charged with four counts of illegally possessing 
explosives 
its going to show that taits not to be trusted said 
defense attorney richard hove hes capable of lying at any time 
it also demonstrates that the government has let him go ahead 
and lie till somebodys conscience decided that they had to say 
something about it assistant us attorney john stephen graham 
said the disclosure about tait wouldnt have any significant effect 
on the governments case graham heads the drug enforcement task 
force that is coordinating the hells angels prosecutions 
defense lawyers have been doing everything they can in all of 
the trials up to this point to put tait himself on trial to divert 
attention from the fact that somebody else actually is charged with 
a crime graham said 
tait worked for three years as an undercover informant in the 
hells angels he has received 63000 in fees from the government 
and is the chief witness against all 41 of the gang members who 
were charged last november with drugs or weapons violations 
several members already have been convicted 
the defendants include ralph sonny barger founder of the 
oakland chapter who is awaiting trial in kentucky in the 
explosives conspiracy case 
lessard faces a trial in kentucky on charges that he gave 
explosives to tait who testified they were to be used to kill 
members of a rival gang the outlaws 
after taits testimony about his drug use graham sent a letter 
to defense lawyers describing taits february 1985 interview with 
fbi agent peter flanagan in alaska where tait had infiltrated a 
hells angels chapter graham realized he was required to disclose 
evidence that could be useful in their cases he said 
in the letter graham quoted flanagan as saying tait advised 
that although his current narcotics use is limited to marijuana 
he did previously have a problem with cocaine use up until 1980 
tait said he managed to completely kick the cocaine habit the 
letter quoted flanagan as saying

strong opposition from ontario lawmakers is 
expected when the government debates its historic free trade 
agreement with the united states 
the government was to introduce the legislation to implement the 
agreement today two years after canada and the united states 
embarked on talks to create a north american freetrade zone 
the inchthick bill would eliminate tariffs and reduce other 
barriers in nearly every facet of the 150 billion us a year 
trading partnership the changes would start jan 1 1989 and be 
phased in over a 10year period 
prime minister brian mulroney and president reagan signed the 
agreement jan 2 
trade minister john crosbie was confident that mulroneys 
progressive conservative party can push the legislation through 
because it controls 208 seats in the 282member house of commons 
we have the majority of members and therefore parliament 
after a reasonable time for debate has to make a decision we will 
use the rules to see that it does crosbie said last week 
but the deal faces many hurdles both in ottawa and washington 
the us senate finance committee approved the accord last week 
but it attached provisions that embarrassed canada the senators 
demanded that mulroney guarantee compliance by canadas 10 
provinces and called for new restrictions on canadian plywood and 
lobsters 
crosbie fired off protest notes to washington and said the 
plywood and lobster issues could provide the first test case for 
the binational trade panels the agreement would create 
a bigger headache for mulroney is opposition within canada 
where polls show public opinion split on free trade 
both main opposition parties the liberals and new democrats 
are against the pact and have vowed to use every parliamentary tool 
to block implementing legislation 
we think it is a terrible deal for the longrange history of 
canada and we will do everything we can to stop it said new 
democratic party leader ed broadbent who claims mulroney traded 
away sovereignty in exchange for temporary relief from us 
protectionism 
the liberals control parliaments upper chamber the appointed 
senate which has delaying and amending powers 
the biggest threat to the deal however comes from the liberal 
premier of ontario province david peterson who says he will take 
the federal government to court if it tries to override provincial 
jurisdiction 
we gave away an enormous amount and we got nothing peterson 
said in a recent interview 
the only province that actively opposes free trade ontario is 
also canadas industrial and financial powerhouse with the 11th 
largest economic output in the world 
petersons immediate concern is 10000 jobs in the grapegrowing 
and wine industry centered in the fertile niagara region the free 
trade agreement calls on canada to eliminate a protectionist 
65percent markup on us wine and liquor over a sevenyear period 
and peterson refuses to do so 
the federal government is empowered under the constitution to 
enter into international treaties and feels confident it would win 
a court challenge but litigation would delay implementation of the 
agreement and anger congress 
officials said the legislation will declare ottawas right to 
force provincial compliance in some cases but mulroney has to be 
careful not to antagonize provinces such as quebec and alberta who 
guard their own powers over energy language and other matters 
mulroney is currently on a fiveday tour of europe where there 
is concern that the canadaus accord will throw up barriers to 
outsiders 
there is considerable concern within europe about the 
possibility that the world is splitting into regional trade 
blocs deanne julius director of economics at the royal 
institute of international affairs in london said on monday but 
mulroney emerged from a meeting with prime minister margaret 
thatcher saying that she endorses the free trade agreement 
i find it strange that any european economist could say a word 
against a bilateral treaty such as ours when the very basis of 
european prosperity is this sort of approach mulroney said 
sylvia ostry canadas multilateral trade negotiator said 
canada and the united states were not creating a new common 
market but simply relaxing bilateral trade restrictions it 
sends out a very positive signal about the american commitment to 
trade liberalization she said in an interview 
the economic council of canada forecasts the accord will create 
250000 jobs and 25 percent additional growth in canada over 10 
years

high credit costs plus heavy overhead and sour 
loans drained 300 million from the federal land bank in jackson 
miss in three years and finally drove it into insolvency a 
federal official says 
as of last friday the banks liabilities exceeded its earning 
assets by approximately 500 million farm credit assistance 
board president eric p thor told a senate panel monday 
he placed losses at 300 million in three years he blamed high 
operating expenses plus the third heaviest credit costs in the 
farm credit system and troubled loans totaling 40 percent of the 
168 billion portfolio 
in addition he said the bank had sought 410 million to 610 
million in aid early this year but never came up with a workable 
business plan he told reporters jackson officials provided a list 
of borrowers that was inaccurate and incomplete 
it seems you have indicated a lot of what you might call poor 
management practices down there said sen john breaux dla 
i would say thats a fair assessment replied thor whose 
agency was created by congress last year as part of a farm credit 
system bailout 
the jackson institution is one of 12 federal land banks in the 
farm credit system a 50 billion network of cooperatively owned 
lenders little known to city folk outside financial circles but 
long a bulwark of us agriculture 
federal regulators closed the doors of the billiondollar 
institution friday and placed it in receivership it reopened 
monday to provide borrowers with information government officials 
hope interim credit for borrowers can be arranged without much 
delay 
but that would last only until the receiver ronald e watkins 
of tulsa okla phases the longtottering bank out of existence 
farmers whose credit is good are likely to find another farm 
credit system institution moving in to serve the jackson banks 
area of alabama mississippi and louisiana regulators said 
they also sought to quell fears of a quick rash of foreclosures 
on the jackson banks large stockpile of nonperforming loans they 
said borrowers rights provisions included in a congressional 
bailout approved by congress last year would be enforced in full 
regulators also offered repeated assurances that borrowers 
stock in the cooperatively owned bank would be retired at face 
value and creditors of the institution would be paid in full under 
provisions of the bailout 
several lawmakers expressed dismay that the situation in jackson 
had been allowed to deteriorate until the bank was beyond help 
they also pressed officials not to allow the same thing happen 
to land banks in other parts of the country 
we want to avoid another jackson in omaha sen tom dascle 
dsd said 
we could find ourselves in the same place that jacksonville is 
in which is not in the interest of farmers or taxpayers said 
sen tom harkin diowa whose state also is served by the omaha 
federal land bank

the extent of chemotherapy needed to cure 
testicular cancer can safely be reduced by 25 percent sparing men 
from some of the misery of the effective but difficult treatment a 
study has found 
experts say the discovery represents another advance in the 
treatment of one of the few highly curable adult cancers 
cancer of the testicles is rare accounting for about 1 percent 
of all male malignancies however it is the most common cancer 
among men between the ages of 15 and 35 
in the study dr lawrence h einhorn of indiana university 
found that the standard course of chemotherapy can be cut from four 
months to three and still cure about 95 percent of patients 
we can now eliminate that fourth course of therapy reducing 
costs side effects and patient inconvenience he said monday at 
the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
the drug cisplatin used in combination with other chemotherapy 
medicines produces a variety of unpleasant side effects including 
hair loss nausea vomiting weakness and numbness of the hands and 
feet 
for a patient the last month of chemotherapy may be 
devastating said dr nicholas vogelzang of the university of 
chicago being able to eliminate it may allow a much higher 
quality of life 
until a decade ago doctors gave chemotherapy to victims of 
testicular cancer for two years then a study showed that four 
months of therapy worked just as well 
a fourmonth course of treatment has been the standard therapy 
since then 
einhorns comparison study was conducted between 1984 and 1987 
on 184 men the cure rates were identical regardless of whether 
they received three or four months of treatment 
men who are initially freed of testicular cancer are generally 
considered to be cured since the disease rarely returns 
in this study 97 percent of the men were initially freed of 
cancer the disease recurred in 5 percent of them although many 
may be cured by a second or third battery of treatment 
the study was conducted on men with socalled favorable 
prognosis cancer which has spread but resulted in relatively 
small growths in the lungs or lymph glands about twothirds of all 
patients fall into this category 
according to the american cancer society testicular cancer will 
be diagnosed in 5600 men this year and 350 will die of the 
disease 
also at the meeting monday the national cancer institute said 
it will try to double over the next four years the number of 
patients who receive experimental treatments in an effort to speed 
up the search for ways to stop the biggest cancer killers 
largely because of physicians reluctance to enroll their 
patients in cancer experiments it may take 10 years or longer to 
assess the value of promising new therapies officials said 
we are not getting enrolled anywhere near the number of 
patients we need to get answers within a reasonable period of 
time said dr vincent t devita jr director of the institute 
currently about 25000 cancer patients each year are enrolled 
in treatment experiments known as clinical trials that are 
sponsored by the institute 
through appeals to doctors and directly to the public the 
institute hopes to double this by 1992

legislators of the governing 
coalition tried without success to compel gen manuel antonio 
noriega to appear in congress to report on talks with the united 
states 
twentyseven legislators voted for the motion monday eight 
voted against it and 12 abstained fortyseven of the bodys 67 
members were on hand for the session of the legislative assembly 
as the unicameral legislature is called 
the congress is empowered to call before it any official but 
such a measure must be approved by twothirds of those present 
had it been passed the motion would have compelled noriega who 
is commander of the 15000member defense forces and de facto ruler 
of panama to appear before the lawmakers to respond to specific 
questions 
among the questions included in the resolution as proposed by 
luis gomez a lawmaker of the revolutionary democratic party or 
prd were 
what has been proposed by the north american negotiators 
what has been proposed by the panamanian negotiators 
why is the united states participating in these negotiations 
when it persists in not recognizing the legitimate government of 
panama 
what is the basic objective pursued by the panamanian 
negotiators and what relation does it have with the national task 
of recovering our complete sovereignty and control of the panama 
canal in the year 2000 
how has the fact that you have been formally accused of 
participating in drug smuggling to the united states affected your 
decision to carry out these negotiations has the united states 
offered to lift these indictments in exchange for what concessions 
from you 
a coalition called the national democratic union ostensibly 
governs panama it comprises the promilitary revolutionary 
democratic party the republican party and the labor party 
eight other legislators representing the revolutionary 
democratic party the laborites and the republicans were 
cosponsors of gomezs resolution 
most abstentions and votes against the resolution came from 
members of the opposition christian democrats and members of the 
authentic panamenist party 
representatives of noriega have been involved for most of may in 
talks with reagan administration envoy michael kozak in an effort 
to resolve the crisis in uspanamanian relatins washington 
insists that the general who was indicted in florida in february 
on federal drugsmuggling and moneylaundering charges resign his 
post and leave the country at least temporarily 
neither noriega nor his associates have spelled out his position 
explicitly but the general has said repeatedly there can be no 
solution as long as what he calls us aggression against panama 
continues 
he says sanctions imposed by the reagan administration 
constitute economic aggression noriega contends that the 
deployment of nearly 2000 soldiers in recent months to reinforce 
the 10000 already stationed in us military institutions along 
the canal constitutes psychological aggression 
he also has demanded that washington respect the government 
of president manuel solis palma solis replaced eric delvalle who 
was removed from the presidency by the national assembly on feb 26 
after trying to fire noriega washington continues to recognize 
delvalle who remains in hiding in panama as the countrys 
president 
asked by the associated press 10 days ago if he was considering 
retiring in august which has been suggested as a feasible date 
for stepping down noriega said the date of his retirement is none 
of washingtons business 
his spokesman maj edgardo lopez said noriega could continue as 
commander for several more years 
noriega denies the drug charges contending they are politically 
motivated 
he says washington intends to replace him with a less 
nationalistic leader who would consent to a strong us military 
presence in panama well into the next century 
the 1977 panama canal treaty between the united states and 
panama obliges washington to hand over to panama complete control 
of the waterway and us military installations by midday dec 31 
1999 
kozak returned to panama on monday following a weekend meeting 
with reagan and the presidents top cabinet members and advisers 
neither the us embassy nor panamanian officials would comment 
on what meetings the envoy has planned in coming days 
precisely what the us is offering noriega has not been 
disclosed though reports from washington have indicated the 
president is inclined to authorize dismissal of the indictments 
against noriega if that would entice him to give up power

the state department persuaded the wife of 
eugene hasenfus not to form a defense fund following her husbands 
capture in nicaragua when a us plane carrying arms for the 
contras was shot down an attorney says 
the accusation that assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
and another state department official interceded within days of the 
oct 5 1986 crash of a c123 transport plane was made by an 
attorney representing the hasenfuses in a civil suit filed monday 
in federal court 
los angeles attorney brian r strange said abrams and william p 
schofield telephoned sally hasenfus to tell her the operators of 
the private resupply network would pay for her husbands legal 
expenses following his capture by the sandinista government 
tape recordings that mrs hasenfus made of the telephone 
conversations provide undisputable evidence of these 
representations strange said in a telephone interview after the 
lawsuit was filed 
state department spokeswoman ellen bork said she could not 
comment on the assertion because the case is in litigation 
the lawsuit originally was filed last fall in california state 
court that action was dismissed hours before the new case was 
brought in us district court in washington strange said 
the breachofcontract suit against southern air transport 
corporate air services and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v 
secord charges that hasenfus employers broke their promises to pay 
his legal expenses after his capture in nicaragua 
hakim and secord defendants in the irancontra arms and money 
conspiracy case along with fired national security council aide 
oliver l north and former national security adviser john m 
poindexter ran the secret contra resupply network during a time 
when american military aid to the rebels was banned by law 
southern air once a cia proprietary company provided planes 
for ferrying arms to the nicaraguan rebels during the aid cutoff 
the lawsuit charges that corporate air services which hired 
hasenfus as a cargo handler in july 1986 was a front created for 
the operation by southern air 
abrams testified before congress after the crash that there was 
no us involvement in the plane which was carrying rifles 
ammunition and grenade launchers to the contras 
later abrams was forced to admit he was completely wrong in 
making this assertion 
the suit alleges that us officials were told by operators of 
the covert arms supply network that they would pay for hasenfuss 
legal expenses following his capture 
these officials who were not specifically identified in the 
complaint but were alleged by strange to be abrams and schofield 
in turn urged mrs hasenfus and her friends not to publicly solicit 
funds for her husbands legal defense in nicaragua where he was 
charged with terrorism 
mrs hasenfus relied on the promises relayed by abrams and 
schofield that her husbands legal bills would be paid by his 
employers the lawsuit said but those bills were never paid the 
lawsuit contends forcing the hasenfus family to deplete their 
lifes savings 
sally and eugene face financial ruin including potential 
foreclosure of their home and possible forced sale of their 
assets the lawsuit said 
strange said schofield who was assigned to the nicaragua desk 
in 1986 telephoned mrs hasenfus several times within days of the 
crash and that abrams made one call himself 
they told sally hasenfus they were in contact with genes 
employers and that everything would be taken care of strange 
said they induced them not to go forward with a fund that was 
being raised 
hasenfus of marinette wis was tried and convicted and 
received a 30year prison sentence but on dec 17 1986 he was 
pardoned by nicaraguan president daniel ortega and allowed to 
return to the united states

richard yberra heading michael dukakis 
presidential campaign in the west says he is taking a page from 
the farm workers struggles of the 1960s and 70s as he organizes 
california for the democratic frontrunner 
the highestranking hispanic in the dukakis campaign yberra is 
a veteran of the united farm workers union and its boycott 
campaigns he is soninlaw of the unions longtime leader cesar 
chavez and his former aide 
yberra directed dukakis campaign in seven other western states 
earlier this year where dukakis won 
in california he is concentrating on building an organization 
both to counter jesse jacksons plans to outspend dukakis on 
television ads and to lay the groundwork for the fall campaign 
against republican george bush 
for many years the conventional wisdom has said california is 
too large to have a grassroots political organization and that 
only big spending on tv is effective yberra said 
campaigns often just come in here to raise money he said 
you have to go back to the bobby kennedy campaign and george 
mcgovern campaign of 68 and 72 to where the farm workers union 
had a lot of involvement and turned out numbers of people in 
certain areas of the state to contribute significantly to those two 
victories 
years later there are a number of democratic activists who 
came out of that period and experience and who take the same 
things we used the same methods we used in the successful 
boycotts into other areas 
california state democratic chairman peter kelly a los angeles 
attorney said the united farm workers has produced democratic 
strategists and organizers for several successful recent campaigns 
they ran all those boycott campaigns and that transferred 
them into politics kelley said 
like many in the dukakis campaign yberra met the massachusetts 
governor while a student at harvards kennedy school of government 
where dukakis taught after losing reelection in 1978 
yberra 39 whose name is pronounced ebeara was from san 
diego and had left college without graduating to volunteer with the 
farm workers he was recruited to attend the kennedy school and 
earned a masters degree in public administration 
i was one of those rare ones at the kennedy school who comes 
from where i came from he said i had dukakis as my professor 
for three courses and sat in on another i had him for almost half 
what i did there i was that impressed with him 
he had been chavezs administrative assistant for three years in 
the early 1970s when he married chavezs daughter anna and later 
held jobs in the administration of california gov jerry brown he 
worked in browns 1980 presidential campaign and for sen edward 
kennedy dmass after brown quit the race 
dukakis relied on organizational strength in several western 
states where he defeated jackson and other rivals including some 
where he did not campaign 
dukakis won arizona without a visit there and won colorados 
caucuses after a visit of only a few hours while jackson spent two 
days and drew massive crowds everywhere he went 
we had supporters calling us worried yberra said 
recalling the days jackson drew throngs in colorado wed say no 
just keep down the line do the program stay consistent were 
going to be ok 
as it turned out he said on caucus day dukakis count proved 
more accurate than the state partys early projections thats 
how good our organization was he said

about 15 billion people around the world 
still cannot get safe water according to a world bank study that 
recommends putting more women in charge of community water supplies 
where women are trained to manage and maintain community water 
systems they often perform better than men because they are less 
likely to migrate are more accustomed to voluntary work and 
because they are more trusted to administer funds honestly says 
the study made available this week 
it was written by john briscoe now the banks senior economist 
for brazil and david de ferranti in charge of population matters 
in its southern africa department the bank is the major source of 
aid loans for almost 120 countries 
the study estimates that in the 1960s only about 20 percent of 
people in poor countries had access to safe water the authors 
think that now it is about 50 percent according to the world 
health organization the best coverage is in latin america and the 
caribbean followed by the asia and pacific region with africa 
bringing up the rear 
recent indepth assessments in east and west africa revealed 
that the population actually using improved water supply schemes 
was only onethird of the population reported to have access the 
report says 
governments are apparently spending about 15 billion a year on 
rural water supply including foreign aid from the united states 
and other countries but the report says it would take three to 
five times that much to get safe water to everyone by the year 2000 
because fetching water has long been considered womens work in 
many lands men attach less importance to the time and effort it 
takes the report says 
in the lowlands of lesotho in southern africa it found that 30 
percent of families spend more than two and a half hours a day 
collecting water 
because drawing water is a womans task men have few 
incentives to carry out repairs and many water systems no longer 
function it says 
the us agency for international development looked into the 
situation in kenya peru tanzania and thailand and found 
importance attached to getting safe water for a variety of reasons 
in addition to saving health and time home gardens livestock 
brick making and beerbrewing 
according to the report local people must have the main 
responsibility and bear much of the cost 
for some these ideas especially the implication that 
disadvantaged rural people should pay for improved water services 
will seem a hardhearted commercial approach it said 
the evidence however is now in the worst possible approach 
is seeing poor people as having no resources promises of free 
service for all too often result in practice in some service for 
a few and little or none for most

it was perhaps the ultimate inside washington 
scene a broadway play about arms control being put on in front of 
the secretary of state the negotiator whose action formed the 
basis of the production and a dozen members of the senate fresh 
from debating an arms control treaty 
and the consensus was that while a walk in the woods is an 
entertaining production it wasnt like the real thing 
it bore no resemblance to reality thats what made it so 
good secretary of state george p shultz said after viewing the 
dark comedy it was interesting it gave you a lot of laughs and 
it took your mind off your work 
in a case of carrying coals to newcastle the producers of the 
play offered to bring it to washington for a production at the 
library of congress across the street from the capitol 
the onetimeonly production was sponsored by several senators 
including claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee pell said he thought the production dramatizes the 
human side of what is too often a faceless bureaucracy 
the twoperson play starred sam waterston as the american 
negotiator and robert prosky as his soviet counterpart written by 
lee blessing it was loosely based on the private 1982 talk between 
paul nitze and yuri kvitsinsky 
that geneva discussion produced an agreement between the two men 
on the framework for a mediumrange missile treaty but the plan 
was later rejected by both governments 
nitze said he was entertained but agreed with shultz it 
didnt bear any relationship to anything we talked about i didnt 
hear anything said on stage that was anything like my talk 
you had a certain amount of theatric license nitze said 
with a laugh noting that in the play the soviet negotiator was 
several decades older than the young american in reality the 
reverse was true 
but like the play the private talk between nitze and kvitsinsky 
produced no lasting agreement 
yes its true we certainly didnt succeed but it was fun to 
try said nitze 
the nitzekvitsinsky talks were part of the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces inf negotiations leading to the treaty now before 
the senate 
maynard glitman nitzes successor also attended the 
production his review its a dramatization and while its 
good its not like reality 
all three men said they enjoyed the play precisely because it 
bore little resemblance to reality 
it was a good characterization and a lot of laughs shultz 
said 
about 250 people were invited including diplomats and members 
of congress

jesse jackson was turning his 
attention today to foreign affairs a day after touting a new 
budget plan and criticizing the economic policies of his rival 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
jackson on monday proposed a fiveyear 344 billion package of 
new health education and housing programs financed by raising 
taxes on corporations and the rich and a freeze on military 
spending 
jackson released his 18page spending plan the most detailed 
budget proposal by any of the presidential candidates remaining in 
the race at a news conference monday at the state capitol in

7 primary 
also monday jackson toured a head start center in a lowincome 
neighborhood near the california capitol and faced a hostile crowd 
of nuclear plant workers at a rally planned by antinuclear 
activists outside of sacramentos rancho seco nuclear plant 
the democratic presidential candidate was playing up foreign 
policy today addressing the world affairs council of los angeles 
he also scheduled a stop at the south african consulate to 
underline his antiapartheid message 
jackson used his budget news conference to contrast his agenda 
for the nation with both dukakis and vice president george bush 
the republican nomineetobe 
he said bush would continue the policies of president reagan and 
dukakis offers only timid adjustments 
reagan has cut investment in health care housing legal

by only 775 million jackson said that is radically 
conservative away from the dreams and aspirations of most 
democrats 
dukakis campaigning in new jersey monday night took exception 
to that assessment 
it does represent a fundamental change over what weve had the 
past four years the massachusetts governor said of his own 
economic plan which he has outlined in more general terms than 
jacksons

down spending figures so far in advance

an arab member of israels parliament on 
monday urged american jews to join american arabs in opposing the 
israeli governments hostile policy toward the palestine liberation 
organization 
the arab community in the united states and the jewish 
community in the states have a common interest as peace lovers and 
im waiting for the jewish community here to play a positive role 
convincing the israeli government to adopt a more reasonable policy 
toward the palestine issue said abdelwahab darawshe 
darawshe a knesset member who recently quit the israeli labor 
party to found a new arab party in israel made the statement at 
the 16th convention of the national association of arabamericans 
the association which seeks a stronger political voice for 
americans of arab ancestry used campaigning for peace as the 
theme of the annual convention speakers condemned israeli measures 
against palestinian demonstrations in the occupied territories 
during the past half year and urged the united states and israel to 
accept the pl0 as the authentic palestinian representative in peace 
talks 
the palestinian people have decided who is their 
representative and any attempt to find alternatives is just wasting 
time and bringing causes for more bloodshed darawshe said he 
also said the plo should formally proclaim a palestinian government 
in exile 
israel and the united states refuse to deal with the plo unless 
it acknowledges israels right to exist 
invitations to mondays session said an unnamed prominent 
israeli official would appear and an empty chair at the head table 
symbolized the officials absence 
hanna siniora editor of the arab newspaper alfajr in 
jerusalem told the gathering it is high time to have the 
international community and the united states bring the adversaries 
to the negotiating table because the alternative is disaster 
to the whole area with national suicide for all parties in the 
region israelis palestinians arabs 
the obstacle to peace is the attitude of the present coalition 
government of israel he said 
in another development 36 members of congress mostly 
democrats sent israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir a letter 
urging him to reconsider the pending deportation of mubarak awad a 
naturalized us citizen of palestinian birth who founded the 
palestinian center for the study of nonviolence 
the recent violence in the occupied territories highlights the 
urgent need to renounce violence and now more than ever the 
philosophy espoused by mr awad will be necessary if israel is to 
enjoy a more secure and peaceful future said the letter 
circulated by the association of arabamericans

the us coast guard and customs service 
intent on hanging onto yachts they seize under the new 
zerotolerance antidrug policy have revised their procedures 
officials say 
this is not really a change in the policy on zerotolerance 
coast guard spokesman capt randall peterson said monday night 
these are just some refinements in how we enforce the law 
under the new guidelines government officials no longer will 
seize vessels on the high seas beyond the 12mile us 
territorial limit simply because they carry small amounts of 
illegal drugs said peterson and customs spokesman dennis murphy 
now the boats will be seized only if there is evidence they are 
being used to transport drugs into the united states they said 
the new guidelines were issued in the wake of highly publicized 
episodes in which expensive yachts were seized and then returned to 
their owners 
among such vessels was the atlantis ii owned by the woods hole 
oceanographic institution of massachusetts which explored the 
wreck of the titanic officials in san diego seized the vessel when 
a crewman was found with a small amount of marijuana 
in florida the coast guard has boarded and confiscated the 25 
million ark royal as well as the monkey business the bahamas 
vacation yacht used by former presidential candidate gary hart 
model donna rice and their friends both yachts carried only minute 
amounts of drugs 
there were a couple of cases last week that raised some 
questions so we sat down with the coast guard and transportation 
so everybody was armed with as much information as possible 
murphy said in some of the cases we ran into we didnt have 
enough evidence or a substantial enough case to take it to 
forfeiture 
peterson said the way the law is written possession of a 
controlled substance such as marijuana inside the 12mile limit is 
against the law however if youre outside the 12mile limit 
there has to be evidence that theres intent to import or export 
the amount of the controlled substance doesnt matter he said 
what matters is where theyve been where they say theyre 
going whats written on the charts indicating where theyre going 
a wide variety of things peterson said 
if customs or coast guard officers see a small amount of illegal 
drugs in plain sight on a vessel on the high seas that will be 
enough evidence to bring the boat in for further search but it 
isnt the same as seizure murphy said 
a spokeswoman for the american civil liberties union which said 
last week that it was conducting a review of the zerotolerance 
policy dismissed the changes as simply a reaction to criticism of 
the seizures 
what this says to me is they have been burned by their own 
publicity national aclu spokeswoman colleen oconnor said in a 
telephone interview from new york they have come to realize the 
criticism of them is valid and they cant withstand it 
the idea of seizing milliondollar yachts for small quantities 
of marijuana had nothing to do with what the administration 
intended for its war on crime oconnor said 
murphy defended the zerotolerance policy saying that since it 
went into effect march 21 it has resulted in the arrests of 1000 
people coming over the border with illegal drugs 
thats what zerotolerance is about he said its a 
policy to arrest and punish users as well as traffickers and 
that is working 
the new guidelines were issued to customs officers last friday 
and to the coast guard officers on saturday the officials said

a dozen paintings believed obtained by 
ferdinand and imelda marcos will be brought to the united states 
from france in an effort to recover some of the at least 35 
billion in wealth the couple removed from the philippines 
usbased philippine investigators said today 
the 16th and 17th century paintings confiscated from saudi 
arabian businessman adnan kashoggi are to be used in a grand jury 
investigation of marcos in new york according to severina rivera 
in charge of the us office of the philippine commission on good 
government 
some of the paintings expected to be turned over to the justice 
department this week had been hanging in the philippine 
presidential palace ballroom in manila before marcos was deposed in 
february 1986 the commission said 
among the paintings are works by el greco peter paul rubens 
frans hals and several other artists 
the commission says it has recovered 204 million in cash real 
estate stocks paintings and antiques with another 211 billion 
contested in litigation in the philippines the united states and 
switzerland 
estimates of wealth taken out of the country by marcos who 
ruled for 20 years and by his family members and associates have 
ranged as high as 10 billion but the commission formed to pursue 
his wealth puts the value of marcos assets currently frozen or 
actively pursued at 35 billion 
in a news release from the commissions washington office 
commission chairman ramon a diaz is quoted as saying that a 
worldwide inventory of paintings claimed by the philippines is 
being put together but it is believed the marcoses purchased more 
than 100 valuable masterpieces from around the world 
the philippines claims that after the marcoses were exiled in 
hawaii his agents and kashoggi carted away 25 paintings from new 
york properties owned by the marcoses the action allegedly came 
after a california federal judge ordered that none of the marcoses 
property could be transferred encumbered or conveyed until the 
court decides who it belongs to marcos or the government of his 
successor president corazon aquino 
thirteen of the paintings were previously returned to the united 
states after kashoggi turned them over to french authorities but a 
company called interconsult eastern management claimed it had 
purchased the remaining 12 art works from kashoggi for 32 million 
the philippine government alleged the sale was invalid because 
kashoggi never actually owned the paintings but was only acting as 
a front for marcos a paris court last friday agreed the paintings 
could be returned to the united states 
the philippine government hopes eventually to sell the 
paintings using the proceeds for landreform programs officials 
have said

thousands of people were evacuated monday 
after authorities feared formation of deadly gas from chemicals 
including cyanide stored at a plating company that was destroyed by 
fire 
up to 11000 residents elementary school pupils and workers in 
the lincoln heights section northeast of downtown were evacuated by 
monday evening hundreds sought shelter at dodger stadium 
no injuries were reported and no chemical cloud had formed 
officials said 
the builders hardware finishers inc building was destroyed by a 
predawn fire that was extinguished by 5 am said fire spokesman 
jim williamson 
the precautionary evacuation was ordered at 1130 am after 
hazardous materials crews determined that 26000 gallons of 
chemicals housed in the plating company were unstable and could 
pose a health hazard williamson said 
one of the stored chemicals was cyanide and that could combine 
with other chemicals to create a deadly gas similar to that used in 
the gas chamber at san quentin said fire inspector ed reed 
at least 11000 people had been evacuated by monday evening 
said police sgt mario mojarro but fire department spokesman greg 
acevedo said the number was closer 3800 the residents were not 
expected to be allowed back into their homes until midnight at the 
earliest authorities said 
this thing may go on all night police officer henry 
covarrubias said late monday 
the red cross set up an evacuation center with overnight 
accommodations under the centerfield bleachers of nearby dodger 
stadium where about 200 people had arrived by 10 pm 
im not going to be able to sleep because i havent seen my 
husband and my husband doesnt know where i am said maria cruz 
at dodger stadium with her small son 
a private company was called in to remove the chemicals 
williamson said firefighters stood by while the chemicals were 
removed from the building 
the fire caused an estimated 340000 damage to the building but 
the cause of the blaze remained under investigation williamson

soviet occupation forces in afghanistan suffer 
from ethnic friction high drug use and low morale that has led to 
suicides and the murder of officers by their troops according to a 
private us study 
the problems appear to be related to the nature of the soviet 
role in afghanistan and do not indicate similar problems in the 
whole soviet military said the rand corp study released monday 
the study conducted for the us army before the start of the 
soviet withdrawal found that the war in afghanistan has shown 
that ethnic cleavages in the soviet armed forces continue to be 
deep particularly between moslems and russians and other slavs 
the author alex alexiev said however the problems would 
not be likely to play much of a role in other war scenarios such 
as a conflict between the warsaw pact and nato 
alexiev said he interviewed 35 former soviet servicemen who 
served in afghanistan and examined more than 300 articles published 
in the soviet press since soviet troops entered that nation in 1979 
the study estimated the number of soviet troops in afghanistan 
at 118000 to 150000 higher than the standard western figure of 
115000 and said they were closely supported by 30000 to 50000 
combat and support troops just across the amu darya river in the 
soviet union 
the study said the morale problems among the occupation troops 
appeared to stem from three main sources the high number of 
criminal convicts among draftees friction between moslems and 
slavs and brutality of officers and older enlisted men toward new 
recruits these problems lead to violence between officers and 
enlisted men as well as suicide 
many soviet officers volunteered to serve in afghanistan because 
it meant higher pay swifter promotion and such benefits as 
guaranteed entrance into prestigious military academies the report 
found 
many draftees it said volunteered for afghanistan in lieu of 
prison 
one former soldier said that in afghanistan soviet officers 
who come are interested only in money for those who serve in 
afghanistan two years are equivalent to six in the soviet union 
there you have to wait six years for a promotion here only two 
but with three times the salary so only greedy people volunteer 
for afghanistan 
the problem of fragging or the murder of officers often 
with fragmentation grenades stems from the cruelty often shown 
toward new enlisted men half of the former soviet soldiers 
interviewed by rand said they had defected because of the brutality 
many of the soldiers in the occupation forces as distinct from 
the elite units are of the same ethnic background as the afghans 
such as tajiks turkomen or uzbeks and often engaged in brawls 
with the russians 
before the soviets entered afghanistan the report said drug 
abuse in the soviet army was considered by most analysts to be 
negligible today there is good reason to believe that a 
majority perhaps even a substantial majority of soviet forces in 
afghanistan use drugs on a fairly regular basis

the reagan administration says it wants to put 
boston banking executive john p laware on the federal reserves 
board of governors 
laware whose nomination was announced monday would fill a 
14year seat that has been empty since december 1986 when henry 
wallich resigned 
laware a 60yearold democrat has been chairman and director 
of shawmut national corp and shawmut bank in boston since 1978 
he was the latest in series of potential candidates for the job 
others considered at one time or another for the post were leif 
olsen the former chief economist at citibank and william 
eagleson retired chairman of mellon bank corp of pittsburgh 
many of the potential candidates ran afoul of a requirement that 
no two members of the sevenmember board can reside in the same fed 
district 
laware resides in brookline mass in the boston federal 
reserve district which does not have a representative on the board 
that laware is a democrat is expected to boost his chances of 
winning approval there had been speculation the 
democraticcontrolled senate might block any nominee to allow the 
next president to fill the spot 
but both sen william proxmire of wisconsin the chairman of the 
senate banking committee and sen jake garn of utah the ranking 
republican have indicated their willingness to consider a reagan 
nomination if it were made quickly 
lawares appointment would mean a board of all reagan nominees 
it was not expected that his arrival would alter the general 
direction of fed policy under chairman alan greenspan who was 
appointed by reagan a year ago to succeed paul volcker 
laware came to shawmut as president in 1978 from chemical bank 
which he joined in 1953 he was named chairman and chief executive 
of shawmut in 1980 
he was graduated from harvard university in 1950 and received a 
masters degree from the university of pennsylvania in 1951

two members of a commission on americas 
minorities refused to sign a final report which says the nation is 
slipping in efforts to achieve equality for blacks hispanics and 
indians 
the report onethird of a nation by the commission on 
minority participation proposes a 20year effort to close the gap 
between the races in income education and other areas 
the group of civic academic and political leaders including 
former presidents ford and carter said america has not only lost 
the momentum of earlier minority progress but has suffered 
reversals in the drive for full equality 
panel members missouri gov john ashcroft and former secretary 
of state william rogers refused to sign the final report 
ashcroft indicated he found it too negative rogers declined to 
discuss his reasons but he was said to have felt the report was 
exaggerated 
ashcroft a republican and one of four governors on the 
40member commission thought the reports generalizations about 
setbacks in progress are overly broad and counterproductive 
according to his office 
two education groups the american council on education and the 
education commission of the states established the commission last 
fall ashcroft chairs the education commission of the states 
among the statistics cited in the report 
in 1986 31 percent of blacks and 27 percent of hispanics were 
living in poverty nearly three times the rate for whites 
unemployment in april was 122 percent for blacks 93 percent 
for hispanics and 46 percent for whites 
twenty percent of whites age 25 or older have completed 
college compared with 11 percent of blacks and just 84 percent of 
hispanics 
the bipartisan panel refrained from directly criticizing the 
reagan administration or anyone else but it said leaders from the 
white house to congress to state capitals must lend their full 
energies to the cause of minority advancement 
the panel included business executives college presidents 
three former secretaries of state edmund muskie cyrus vance and

our units found several people outside suffering from 
everything from respiratory to shrapneltype injuries from the

president daniel ortega extended for 
30 days a ceasefire to give his leftist sandinista government and 
the rebels more time to arrange a permanent truce 
however the two sides remained deadlocked on monday over the 
site of their next round of peace talks 
ortega insisted that the three days of negotiations scheduled to 
begin on wendesday be held in the nicaraguan capital of managua 
in a statement issued in miami the rebels said they were 
planning to meet in sapoa a small nicaraguan village on the costa 
rican border 
both sides had agreed in march to a 60day truce that would have 
expired may 30 the extension means the temporary truce ends june 
30 
ortega said he decided to stretch the ceasefire in the 
interest of allowing negotiations to continue on a definite truce 
we hope the counterrevolutionary directorate contributes to this 
effort and acts in accordance with the nicaraguan peoples wishes 
for peace

another round of negotiations in managua 
they complained that during two previous sessions the 
government restricted them to a hotel near the airport on the 
outskirts of managua and refused to let them move freely in the 
capital and meet with domestic political opposition groups 
the five directors of the nicaraguan resistance the contras 
miamibased umbrella organization said in their statement on 
monday that defense minister humberto ortega had proposed sapoa and 
san juan del sur as meeting sites the defense minister is 
president ortegas brother and chief of the government delegation 
negotiating with the contras 
president ortega said contra delegates would be allowed to meet 
in managua with representatives of the democratic coordinate the 
principal opposition group the opposition newspaper la prensa and 
roman catholic bishops

american gary moore 38 was expelled from nicaragua after he 
entered a restricted military zone with fake identification

anonymity said moore was working for a conservative american group 
and was arrested may 18 at laguna de perlas a military zone on the 
caribbean coast he was deported to neighboring costa rica either

file and wants it expunged 
his lawsuit filed monday also seeks a stop to mail tampering 
and surveillance and unspecified damages for violation of his 
privacy 
i feel that with a black spot on my record it works against 
me getting a job he says they invaded my privacy but i can 
understand why if theres a potential threat 
fbi spokesman james knights in newark said he cannot comment on 
the suit same as in any investigation were not going to 
confirm or deny 
most of the tampered mail came from the soviet union according 
to the suit in 1984 a year after he began the encyclopedia 
project as a sixthgrader an fbi agent visited his north haledon 
home and later questioned him on the telephone the suit said 
the suit also charges that pattersons first amendment rights 
were violated on the grounds that he was being penalized for 
pursuing his education and expressing himself 
eric neisser of the american civil liberties union in new 
jersey says the case is the nations first seeking the right to 
wipe out fbi files on first amendment grounds 
a page from pattersons fbi file obtained under the federal 
freedom of information act and provided by his lawyer reads 
this communication is classified secret in its entirety 
it continues 
todd is in the seventh grade at the most blessed sacrament 
school in franklin lakes 
newark indices as well as local criminal checks negative on 
subject 
in view of the above newark contemplates no further 
investigation in this matter 
the papers also describe pattersons encyclopedia project which 
the youth said is unfinished 
the postal service told him it had no explanation for the 
damaged mail which included torn booklets empty envelopes 
retaped letters and even an opened package containing a letter from 
sweden addressed to someone in wayne whom the youth didnt know 
the suit says that when pattersons father edgar first made a 
freedom of information request in october he was refused after an 
appeal the fbi released six pages much of them blacked out and 
half duplicated 
the rest was classified according to a justice department 
official 
he doesnt want them to have a file in the fbi in their 
subservice files said aclu attorney frank askin who is 
representing patterson 
its not to deface the fbi patterson said of the suit 
patterson said he hopes to join the us foreign service some day 
and his main concern is the effect of the file on that goal 
patterson also said he is considering enrolling at the state 
university of new york at plattsburgh where he would need a 
security clearance for their government program internship with the 
canadian government 
patterson said he holds no grudge against the fbi 
its good they looked into it he said of the investigation 
into his foreign correspondence but at a certain point its got 
to stop

the nations main opposition party 
today blamed us policies and the south korean governments 
humiliating subservience to the united states for a wave of 
student riots 
the party for peace and democracy led by former presidential 
candidate kim daejung said the protests were caused in part by 
attempts to subordinate korean policy to us interests 
the party also called on protesters to halt attacks on us 
diplomatic offices and said it did not endorse protesters calls 
for the removal of us troops from south korea 
but the statement it released today was the partys harshest 
criticism of the united states in recent months 
although we understand the feelings of the students we 
strongly ask them not to use violence under any circumstances 
the statement said 
radical students have made three attacks on us diplomatic 
posts in seoul and the southern city of kwangju since thursday at 
least five police officers and two students have been hurt in the 
attacks but no us personnel have been injured 
protesters attacked the us information service center in 
kwangju with firebombs late monday students hurling bombs scaled 
the walls of the us embassy in seoul on friday after an attack on 
the seoul us information service office the day before 
national police headquarters in seoul said the nation was quiet 
today after clashes monday in kwangju 165 miles south of seoul 
prime minister lee hyunjae promised action after the governing 
democratic justice party called today for tighter security to 
protect us diplomatic facilities and its own offices 
the party for peace and democracy urged the government and the 
united states to study why students were protesting and take steps 
to end repressive rule and other unpopular policies 
the protests it said were caused by us policies that 
emphasize its own national interests and the south korean 
governments humiliating subservience toward the us 
thousands of radical students and dissidents battled riot police 
with firebombs and rocks in seoul and other cities during the past 
week in the worst political unrest since nationwide riots in the 
summer of 1987 
radical groups have called for the overthrow of president roh 
taewoo and the removal of 42000 us troops based in south korea 
under a mutual defense pact 
national police officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that students who attacked the us information center in 
kwangju planned to seize the building to force the us ambassador 
to hold a public debate in the city on the american role in a 1980 
uprising 
the recent riots erupted around the may 18 anniversary of the 
antigovernment revolt at least 191 people were killed when army 
forces suppressed the uprising and radicals claim the united 
states was behind the suppression 
us officials have consistently denied the us government had 
anything to do with the kwangju revolt the united states has 
tended to push quietly for democratic reform in south korea over 
the years

maryland has become the first state to ban 
the sale of inexpensive handguns including saturday night 
specials but voters probably will have the final say on whether 
the law actually goes into effect 
with 200 police officers from five states present gov william 
donald schaefer on monday signed the law forbidding manufacture and 
sale of the weapons 
this is the first time a legislature has stood up and said 
these guns are wrong said schaefer 
well before the ceremony opponents were gathering signatures to 
hold a referendum on the law in novembers general election 
im confident that we are going to have the numbers that we 
need for the ballot said fred griisser spokesman for the 
maryland committee against the gun ban the committee must have the 
signatures of 33044 registered voters by june 30 to put the issue 
on the ballot 
griisser was less confident about the outcome of a referendum 
saying gun groups face an uphill battle in explaining the laws 
true nature to voters 
he said the statute bans all handguns not just saturday night 
specials and complained it does not require that any guns be 
approved for sale by a review board established by the law 
gun control supporters said marylands law and the expected 
referendum are crucial to efforts to ban saturday night specials in 
other states 
its important that we win its critical and im sure we 
will win said sarah brady who attended the signing ceremony 
with her husband white house press secretary james brady 
id like to see other states like dominoes fall into line 
said brady who was wounded by a saturday night special in john 
hinckleys 1981 assassination attempt on president reagan brady 
has been in a wheelchair ever since 
mrs brady accused the laws opponents of spreading false 
information that the bill would ban all handguns and said it is 
aimed only at saturday night specials 
the bradys joined state leaders and 200 uniformed police 
officers from maryland pennsylvania delaware virginia and west 
virginia on the steps of the state house for the signing 
schaefer called the measure a step toward stopping the 
senseless killing on our streets 
saturday night specials have been used to kill 250000 people 
and wound 1 million in the last 20 years said mrs brady who 
called the law a great step for public safety 
the law makes it illegal after jan 1 1990 to sell or 
manufacture a gun in maryland unless it is on a list prepared by 
the newly created ninemember review board the law does not 
mention saturday night specials but directs the board to exclude 
easily concealed inaccurate unsafe and poorly made handguns 
the law also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can be 
slipped through metal detectors 
manufacturers can be fined up to 10000 and dealers and gun 
owners up to 2500 per violation each time a gun is made or sold 
constitutes a separate violation 
mrs brady who has been campaigning for tougher gun laws since 
her husband was shot said marylands approach solves the difficult 
problem of trying to define saturday night specials by leaving the 
decision to a review board 
the board will consist of three civilians the superintendent of 
state police and one representative each of a state prosecutors 
association the maryland association of chiefs of police 
marylanders against handgun abuse the national rifle association 
and a maryland gun manufacturer

wpixtv for whom schoenbrun had done freelance work

a polish sailor who jumped ship in a bid 
for political asylum has been released from jail after two months 
still facing possible deportation but flooded with offers of money 
and shelter 
its wonderful finally free andrzej piotr prajzner 27 
said after paying bail and leaving the snohomish county jail on 
monday 
offers of aid including donations to meet prajzners 1500 
bail began arriving when news reports described his plight after 
jumping ship in british columbia on march 15 and being thrown in 
jail by a us immigration judge 
it constantly amazes me how a soviet seaman who jumps ship can 
get asylum in four hours and a cuban bicyclist in mexico denied 
asylum there was brought to texas and given instant asylum its 
quite a contrast thats why so many people were outraged by 
prajzners case said daniel p danilov a lawyer who is 
representing the sailor 
an immigration and naturalization service official said 
prajzners case differs from the cases cited by danilov because he 
did not have permission to be in the united states when he 
requested asylum at the uscanadian border at blaine on march 23 
this is routine done whenever somebody sneaks over the 
border said pamela carrozza ins deputy district director 
cases like this one fall under separate statutes than when 
somebody is already in the united states legally and then requests 
asylum 
prajzner who had been a cook aboard a fishing vessel said he 
had been hoping to come to the united states since he was a young 
man 
i cannot live under a communist government because of the 
repression he wrote in his petition for asylum i want to be a 
free man in a free country 
if returned to poland he said i would be imprisoned for 
jumping ship and applying for asylum 
at his immigration hearing may 13 the state department agreed 
supporting his plea and saying he had a wellgrounded fear of 
persecution if he were returned to poland 
immigration judge daniel kuhn denied asylum and ordered prajzner 
deported he had no legal representation at the hearing and was 
held in jail until his story became known 
prajzner has since received offers totaling more than 3000 to 
pay his 1500 bail and 15 families mostly from the seattle area 
volunteered to take him in others have offered him jobs danilov 
said 
the polish american congress in washington dc also joined 
the effort to win him asylum danilov said 
danilov said he filed an appeal on prajzners behalf monday and 
was waiting for a court date 
prajzner speaking through an interpreter said he was a little 
nervous about the future and bemused by his sudden celebrity but 
happy about the prospect of staying in america and thankful for the 
efforts of those who helped him 
i didnt know what to expect in the united states prajzner 
said people have been so giving i didnt expect all this

federal officials have given the toledo zoo 
the green light to open its giant panda exhibit today but are 
still asking the zoo to produce original export documents for the 
animals by next week 
last week the us fish and wildlife service said the zoo would 
not be allowed to display the two pandas on loan from china until 
the document issue was resolved the zoo which is scheduled to 
open the panda exhibit today was given 10 days to come up with the 
documentation 
however fws spokesman david klinger said monday that lawyers 
for the zoo gave the service a copy of the chinese export permit 
over the weekend and appear to be making a goodfaith effort to 
deliver the original documents 
were not going to stand in the way of them opening their 
exhibit this week said klinger 
klinger said the pandas were taken out of the wild in china 
nearly two months after dec 6 1983 the date pandas were put on 
an international conservation groups endangered species list that 
means the animals do not qualify for an exemption under a 1975 
convention signed by 95 countries including china and the united 
states he said

the federal government says the effects of 
acid rain are being felt in small streams in the midatlantic 
states where surface waters had previously had not been proven 
vulnerable 
four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 in 
midatlantic areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristics 
that made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from natural 
sources an environmental protection agency study concluded 
the study made available monday said the proportion reached 10 
percent on forested ridges inland from coastal lowlands 
the lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in these 
streams makes it likely that their acidity is probably 
associated with atmospheric acid deposition said the study 
courtney riordan head of acid rain research for epa said the 
new findings show there has been an expansion of the geographic 
area known to be influenced by acid rain

a 19yearold psychology student who has 
born in thailand but lives in southern california captured the 1988 
miss universe crown today in a pageant dominated by asian women 
porntip nakhirunkanok the reigning miss thailand wiped away 
tears of joy and joined her hands in a thai sign of thanks after 
she was named to succeed 1987 miss universe cecilia bolocco of 
chile 
miss nakhirunkanok a blackhaired woman from bangkok will 
receive more than 250000 in cash and prizes including a maserati 
convertible and a mink coat 
three of the other four finalists were from asia including 
first runnerup yunjung chang of south korea amanda olivares of 
mexico mizuho sakaguchi of japan and pauline yeung of hong kong 
were finalists in a field that began with 66 contestants 
miss usa courtney gibbs of fort worth texas was one of 10 
semifinalists 
taiwan authorities lifted a 23yearold ban on beauty contests 
in october to bring the 37th annual pageant to this island 
organizers estimated about 700 million people watched the event 
beamed around the world from linkou stadium in suburban taipei 
the pageant began at 9 am today 9 pm edt monday so us 
viewers could watch the program during prime time 
miss nakhirunkanok who weighs 114 pounds and stands 5 feet 8 
inches tall said she moved to los angeles with her family 15 years 
ago 
when asked by host alan thicke how she had learned english she 
replied i think i owe it to big bird i watched sesame street 
a lot when i was little 
the new miss universe said she is a sophomore studying 
psychology at pasadena city college in californa and that she 
briefly attended ucla she also is involved in charity work for 
youth in thailand 
thailand won the miss universe title once before in 1965 when 
apasra hongsakula was chosen 
beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by taiwans leaders who 
viewed the competitions as an extravagance for a poor nation and 
were dismayed by reports that a miss china winner performed strip 
dances in las vegas 
the island has since emerged as one of asias most prosperous 
countries authorities lifted the ban last year to clear the way 
for a domestic airline to sponsor the miss universe pageant despite 
lingering opposition from a few groups including retired soldiers 
who view beauty contests as an insult to mothers 
but the telecast generally was seen in taiwan as an opportunity 
to present the island to a worldwide audience as the republic of 
china the official name of taiwan that is seldom used 
internationally because most countries recognize the rival 
communist chinese government in beijing the televised program 
repeatedly referred to taiwan as the republic of china 
missing from the program was longtime host bob barker an 
animal rights activist who resigned after last years competition 
in singapore to protest the use of furs

thats the big question hook said monday night thats 
why we turned the investigation over to our internal affairs unit 
out of washington 
a panamanian attorney working undercover for the dea gave the 
documents to agency officials in panama city and they were stored 
in a safe in the us embassy in panamas capital nbcs nightly 
news reported monday 
a 12count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in miami 
on feb 4 accused the panamanian leader of accepting 46 million 
in bribes from colombias violent medellin drug cartel a grand 
jury in tampa indicted noriega the next day on three marijuana 
importation counts 
the postindictment information reportedly contained in the 
documents was not crucial to the case said dea spokesman cornelius 
dougherty in washington 
at this point in time it does not affect the indictment he 
said beyond that i cant go 
hook said he was unsure how important the documents were but 
that the person who provided them to the dea described them as 
relevant to the charges 
his claim was that they would be beneficial in the general 
noriega case for the united states and again at this point we 
dont know if thats true or not hook said 
us attorney leon kellner confirmed that an investigation into 
the documents was being conducted but said he couldnt comment on 
the contents or significance of the documents 
the documents reportedly include flight plans and financial 
records that corroborate the testimony of drug pilot floyd carlton 
a key witness against noriega 
nbc quoted unidentified authorities as saying that us drug and 
intelligence agents in panama city were suspects in the 
disappearance of the documents 
thats absolutely false dougherty told the associated 
press theres no information or indication in any information 
that weve received that would support any such allegation 
the investigation a matter of routine policy is on the 
informant and not on any dea agent dougherty said

a man convicted of kidnapping and 
murdering a businessman by burying him alive in a coffinlike box 
took the american dream and turned it into an edgar allan poe 
nightmare the prosecutor says 
assistant attorney general michael ficaro is seeking the death 
penalty for daniel j edwards 31 of bourbonnais who was 
convicted monday 
the jury deliberated about an hour before finding edwards guilty 
in the sept 2 abduction of stephen small who suffocated while 
buried in a rural section of kankakee county in northeast illinois 
before his family could pay the 1 million ransom 
small 40 was a greatgrandson of former gov len small and a 
member of a family with major media holdings he was vice president 
of mid america media which owned radio and cable television 
stations before its sale in 1986 
edwards showed no emotion when it was announced he had been 
convicted of three counts of murder and 10 counts of aggravated 
kidnapping 
the jury will reconvene wednesday to determine whether he should 
be sentenced to death 
in his closing argument in the weeklong trial ficaro said 
edwards knew the kankakee businessman wouldnt survive the burial 
i never saw anybody come out of a grave ficaro said 
take a good long look he told jurors as he pointed to the 
homemade plywood crate in which small died danny edwards greed 
for the big score drove those nails dug that grave and buried 
stephen small alive 
all danny boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put 
stephen small in a box said ficaro slamming his hand on the 
crate he took the american dream and turned it into an edgar 
allan poe nightmare 
edwards was a man who made greed his god and planned for 
small to die so he could not tell police what had happened said 
assistant attorney general frank nowicki 
defense attorney sheldon reagan argued that a faulty air supply 
system caused smalls death he pointed out that small was buried 
with candy bars lights and water and had not been harmed 
its an accident but its not an intentional murder said 
reagan who sugggested someone else abducted small 
you dont make a box by accident countered ficaro 
stephen small didnt wander by and fall in 
the prosecution argued that the candy bars lights and water 
along with the plastic pipe the kidnapper claimed was for air 
were used to lure small into the box 
small was lured from his victorian home after midnight sept 2 
his wife nancy received ransom calls throughout the day but could 
not understand her husbands taperecorded instructions for 
delivering the cash 
two days later police found smalls body buried under 3 feet of 
sand about 13 miles southeast of kankakee 
danny edwards needed stephen small to make those tape 
recordings and get in that box without a fight said nowicki 
he said small clawed scratched and struggled to get out of the 
box as he used up the limited air supply but probably died within 
hours

a former harvard business school professor who 
claims she was the victim of sex discrimination is being pressed to 
identify specific acts of bias that allegedly stopped her from 
becoming the schools fifth tenured woman 
barbara bund jackson 44 said monday in the first day of 
testimony that several faculty members discriminated against her 
during her 11 years of teaching at the 80yearold school 
jackson who resigned in 1984 is asking us district court 
judge douglas p woodlock to reinstate her with tenure and award 
847000 in lost income 
she cited several incidents of alleged sex bias by several 
faculty members saying one professor threatened that if she didnt 
change the title of a course he would not back her for tenure the 
same professor she said refused to help her with computer program 
problems in one course 
maybe he simply didnt like you as an individual harvard 
attorney allan a ryan jr said of professor robert schlaifer 
i had been told the opposition was based on gender ms 
jackson said my reaction when i see someone acting childish is 
to look for a reason through conversations with a number of 
people i was led to conclude it was bias 
but when ryan asked whether she could link schlaifer to her 
tenure denials in 1981 and 1983 she said she had no information 
one way or another 
to me bias is a spectrum and i dont know where to draw the 
line in that spectrum ms jackson said 
in her lawsuit ms jackson says she was held to higher 
standards than male candidates during her tenure review she said 
the school destroyed documents requested by her attorney to support 
her claim that lessqualified men than her received tenure from 
1974 to 1984 
ms jackson also says harvard has discriminated against women in 
hiring and admissions and is guilty of institutional bias 
harvard maintains ms jackson was denied tenure solely because 
her academic work was substandard and the tenure records were 
unwittingly destroyed by someone outside the business school 
the lawsuit also names the schools dean john h mcarthur 
under crossexamination ms jackson testified that she 
supported mcarthurs appointment in 1980 and thanked him for 
settling a dispute involving an oncampus recruiter who told 
students his company would not post women to europe 
ms jackson now a private marketing consultant began teaching 
at harvard as an assistant professor in 1973 she was promoted to 
associate professor in 1977 and applied for tenure in 1981 
after failing to win faculty support on the grounds that while 
her teaching skills were up to par her scholarship was inadequate 
ms jackson was given a threeyear extension on her appointment 
she submitted new academic work for review but in december 1983 
was rebuffed again 
tenure decisions at harvard are submitted to a faculty 
subcommittee and to the faculty to gauge support for the professor 
the actual decision rests with the university president who 
receives a recommendation from the schools dean 
three of the business schools 90 tenured professors are women 
four women have received tenure in the business schools history 
the first in 1961 
nationally 72 percent of male faculty members have tenure 
compared with 45 percent of females according to a recent survey 
of 1055 two and fouryear institutions by the american 
association of university professors

a programmer deleted more than 160000 
files from his exemployers computer by infecting it with an 
electronic virus said authorities who are prosecuting him on 
felony charges 
donald gene burleson 39 faces a charge of harmful access to 
a computer and is free on a 3000 bond pending his july 11 
trial if convicted he could be sentenced to 10 years in prison 
an indictment accuses him of executing programs designed to 
interfere with the normal use of the computer and of acts that 
resulted in records being deleted 
police described the electronic interference as a massive 
deletion of more than 168000 records of sales commissions for 
employees 
burleson is thought to be the first person charged under the 
state law that took effect sept 1 1985 and prohibits computer 
sabotage said davis mccown chief of the tarrant county district 
attorneys economic crimes division 
three weeks after the law went into effect uspa and ira co a 
fort worthbased national securities and brokerage concern noticed 
a problem with its computer system investigators said 
an investigation revealed that an intruder had used a backdoor 
password at night to gain access to the computer and covered his 
tracks by erasing computer logs that would have documented his 
activity 
burleson a computer security officer who had been fired two 
days before the infection was one of only a few of the 200 workers 
in the home office to have the access and knowledge needed to 
sabotage the system officials said a computer virus is a 
program that can severely damage a systems regular software 
viruses can be transmitted among systems through contaminated 
software or from programs picked up from electronic bulletin boards 
you can see it but you cant see what it does just like a 
human virus said mccown it had the ability to multiply and 
move around and was designed to change its name so it wouldnt be 
detected 
mccown quoted in mondays dallas morning news said he wants to 
make sure that this type of criminal understands that we have the 
ability to make these type of cases that its not so sophisticated 
or complicated that its above the law 
uspa already has been awarded 12000 by a jury in a civil 
lawsuit filed against burleson

focus of ethnic unrest 
in a telephone call to the associated press in moscow a man 
said several hundred people marched from downtown stepanakert the

armenians predominantly christians but since 1923 the region has 
been part of azerbaijan most of whose residents are moslem

economically and culturally by azerbaijani leaders 
strikes and street rallies began in nagornokarabakh in 
february subsided and then began again march 24 that round of 
walkouts tapered off gradually starting april 1 
the latest round came two days after communist party officials 
fired the two leaders of armenia and azerbaijan apparently because 
they had not quelled the ethnic unrest in the region where at 
least 32 people have died violently since february 
the central government in moscow has refused the demands to turn 
the area over to armenia offering instead a plan for 690 million 
in economic social and cultural improvements for nagornokarabakh

the 1500 deputies of the supreme soviet 
parliament opened their spring session today with an agenda that 
focuses on domestic issues and does not include a vote on ratifying 
the superpower missile treaty 
such a vote is not required by soviet law but could have been 
used to ratify the treaty before the moscow superpower summit 
between soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan 
which begins sunday 
gorbachev and the rest of the kremlin leadership filed into an 
ornate creamcolored hall of the grand kremlin palace shortly 
before 10 am for the beginning of todays legislative session 
the supreme soviet a rubberstamp body that gives force of law 
to decisions already taken by the communist party leadership then 
adopted an agenda that focuses solely on domestic concerns 
on monday the foreign affairs commissions of both houses of the 
bicameral soviet parliament endorsed the superpower 
intermediaterange nuclear missile treaty and called on the 
presidium the nations highest executive body to ratify it 
the pact banning medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles was 
signed by gorbachev and reagan at the washington summit on dec 8 
and does not become legally binding until it is ratified 
the soviets have repeatedly indicated that they are in no hurry 
to ratify the treaty before the us senate does 
viktor p karpov head of the foreign ministrys arms control 
and disarmament desk told western reporters on monday that his 
country should not act until approval by the senate is certain 
we should be sure that we are not alone karpov said 
at least 67 of the 100 us senators must ratify the treaty 
before it becomes binding on the united states and a small band of 
opponents have shown no signs of allowing the pact to be put to a 
vote before the moscow summit 
ratification by the presidium a body of 30odd members headed 
by andrei a gromyko the titular soviet head of state would 
formally commit the soviet union to the treaty 
ratification by the soviets has never appeared in question as 
the pact was approved by the ruling party politburo and signed by 
gorbachev who is communist party general secretary and a member of 
the supreme soviet presidium 
the supreme soviet began its morning session today with several 
personnel changes including the appointment of moscow party boss 
lev n zaikov to membership on the presidium 
on nov 11 zaikov replaced boris n yeltsin as head of the 
party organzation in the capital after yeltsin was fired in 
disgrace yeltsin had questioned the pace of gorbachevs program 
for economic and social change at a closeddoor meeting of the 
party central committee the previous month 
one bill lawmakers will vote on widens the possibilities for 
citizens to form economic cooperatives one of the ways soviet 
leaders are trying to ease shortages of goods and services in the 
staterun economy 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov called the measure of immense 
social and political significance 
the law to take effect july 1 bars the state from seizing 
property belonging to cooperatives and establishes a progressive 
tax on income earned by coops 
ryzhkov said that in the three months since a draft of the new 
law had been published almost 6000 coops have formed compared 
to 14000 in the previous 18 months 
he said soviet authorities had not been able to stop 
speculators from taking advantage of the opportunities offered 
by cooperatives but said that if citizens were productive there 
could be no justifiable limit on their earnings

the un command today accused north 
korea of trying to disrupt the 1988 olympic games by fabricating 
false claims that war is looming on the korean peninsula 
us rear admiral william pendley in a letter delivered to 
north korean officials said an investigation of a recent spate of 
claimed border violations found they were completely false 
these ridiculous actions by your side that are obviously 
designed to discourage participation in the forthcoming seoul 
olympics will convince no one and will be condemned by the world 
community pendley said in the letter which was released to the 
press 
north korea has charged repeatedly in recent months that us 
and south korean forces are preparing to start a war on the divided 
peninsula to try and conquer the communist north 
in tokyo president joaquim chissano of mozambique said today 
that north korean leader kim il sung told him the north will not 
take part in the olympics 
chissano who arrived in japan on monday after visits to north 
korea and china told reporters that kim il sung indicated the 
north korean position on the olympics just by saying that north 
korea was not going to participate in the games because they did 
not want to condone the policy of two koreas 
north korea said in january it would boycott the olympics after 
its demand to cohost the games was rejected by south korea and the 
international olympic committee the committee said the games are 
awarded to a city and cannot be shared 
south korea and the committee have been urging the north to 
reconsider and take part in the games in seoul but chissanos 
statement indicated there was little hope pyongyang would agree 
south korea the united states and other nations charged that 
north korea was responsible for the nov 29 bombing of a south 
korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board a 
selfconfessed north korean agent said the plane was bombed to 
disrupt the olympics 
pendley senior delegate to the united nations command charged 
that north korea was conspiring to disrupting the olympics by 
fomenting tension with false charges of border incidents 
the results of our investigations revealed that your charges 
are completely false he said 
the unc is a military command composed of us and south korean 
forces it deals with north korean and chinese delegates at 
meetings of the military armistice commission that polices the 
ceasefire that ended the korean war in 1953 some 42000 us 
troops are based in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
the commands statement was issued after south korea refused 
today to accept a north korean letter calling for talks between 
student delegations from the two nations on improving relations 
the south korean red cross said 
the south korean red cross said in a telephone message to its 
north korean counterpart that the letter would not be accepted at 
the border truce site of panmunjom the north called for student 
talks on promoting reunification 
the south korean government insisted instead that the north 
resume intergovernment talks it broke off in 1986 to protest 
ussouth korean military exercises 
the two koreas divided since 1945 are bitter enemies that have 
clashed repeatedly over the years they fought the korean war from 
1950 to 1953 after the north invaded the south

fire broke out on a freight ferry carrying 75 
people in the english channel and one crewman was killed and 
another severely burned before firemen flown in by helicopter put 
out the blaze early today 
emergency services on both sides of the channel the worlds 
busiest waterway launched a rescue operation when the fire began 
in the ferrys engine room at 930 pm 430 pm edt monday

left the southeast english port of dover for the belgian port of 
zeebrugge 
sealink uk ltd owners of the 5917ton ferry said in a 
statement that 15 firefighters and their equipment were flown by 
helicopter to the vessel 
it said the firefighters would remain aboard until the ferry 
arrived at the french port of dunkirk where a tugboat was towing

compartment which caused quite considerable damage the fire 
brigade said in a statement 
a british royal air force helicopter airlifted the injured crew 
member to the kent and canterbury hospital in southeast england 
the hospital said his burns were critical 
we understand that it the cause of the fire was a

room which then eventually caught fire chris garnett sealinks 
european director said in a radio interview with the british 
broadcasting corp 
the seafreight freeway built in 1981 and capable of carrying 
about 70 trucks has been on charter to sealink since june 1986 it 
operates between dover britains busiest ferry terminal and 
zeebrugge and dover and dunkirk 
lifeboats rescue tugs and helicopters from both sides of the 
channel raced to the seafreight freeway when it reported the fire 
28 miles off the southeast english coast

condition of anonymity said other recent prokhomeini 
demonstrations led to violent protests against the tehran regime 
and against irans 7yearold war with iraq several people were 
reported killed and scores arrested 
it was not clear whether khomeinis request to cancel the march 
was linked to the protests which diplomatic sources and travellers 
from iran reported during and after the second stage of elections 
for the majlis or parliament on may 13 
but it was believed that the regime was seeking to avoid 
provoking more trouble in the capital which has been badly 
battered by longrange iraqi missiles in a sevenweek missile 
exchange with iraq that ended april 21 
iranian officials reported 1500 people killed in the missile 
blitz but diplomatic sources said the death toll was closer to 
3000 
khomeini called last week for unity among irans leaders after 
the elections in which radicals made sweeping gains and 
conservatives fared badly 
khomeini said in an address broadcast by the staterun 
television and radio network a majlis without diversity of views 
is an imperfect majlis but the outcome should not result in 
dividing us into two hostile groups 
the leader whose preelection support for the radicals was seen 
as a major boost for them said there had been unspecified attempts 
to create discord but that thanks to god they did not 
succeed 
in an apparent reference to deepening divisions between the 
radicals who advocate wider state control of the economy and the 
conservatives who support a more open capitalist system khomeini 
noted 
there are not two fronts of course there are two ways of 
thinking and it should be so he said but different tastes do 
not mean that the people should not be on good terms with each 
other 
two senior shiite clergymen meanwhie were reported to have 
written an open letter to khomeini appealing to him to end the 
conflict with iraq 
but irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored 
in nicosia on saturday reported that the two ayatollahs mohammed 
reza golpayegani and shahbeddin najafimarashi categorically 
denied that they had demanded an end to the war 
by some western diplomatic estimates as many as 1 million 
iranians have been killed or wounded in the conflict the iranians 
have suffered several military and economic setbacks in recent 
weeks 
on monday an iranian war communique said iranian warplanes 
heavily bombed iraqi troops east of the border city of basra in 
five consecutive runs 
iranian land forces also repulsed an iraqi attack near sumar 
completely routing and chasing the attackers into iraq after 
inflicting heavy losses the communique claimed 
the official iraqi news agency said on monday that iraqi jets 
flew 145 combat missions and helicopter gunships flew 163 missions 
against the iranians inflicting heavy losses and damage the 
iraqi news agency reported downing an iranian bell214 helicopter 
but iran denied the claim

actor burt lancaster filed a 15 million 
breachofcontract lawsuit against columbia pictures contending 
the studio improperly fired him from the film the old gringo 
and replaced him with gregory peck 
the suit filed monday in superior court charged that 
lancaster 74 was dismissed because the studio had trouble 
obtaining cast insurance for him such insurance protects a 
studios investment in a film should an actor die or become 
disabled 
the suit seeks 15 million for the alleged breach of an oral 
contract 
columbia had no right to terminate the agreement between the 
parties based on an inability to obtain cast insurance until it 
first notified lancaster or his representatives of any potential 
problem and allowed them to resolve it by various measures 
the suit states 
the suit also contends columbia negotiated with peck even before 
lancaster was fired 
studio officials could not immediately be reached for comment a 
telephone call to columbia monday night went unanswered 
lancaster declined to discuss the suit 
according to the suit the veteran actor and columbia agreed 
verbally in october 1987 that he would be paid a minimum of 15 
million over a threeyear period for his work as part of that oral 
agreement the suit stated the studio was to obtain cast insurance 
lancaster said the studio failed to notify him of the insurance 
problems until it announced in december that he was being fired 
because it was unable to secure insurance for him at customary 
rates 
lancaster had quadruple bypass heart surgery in 1983 however 
the suit said a doctor determined in november 1987 that the actors 
heart conditon had stabilized and he was in good physical health 
lancaster a former circus acrobat established himself as a 
star with his first film the killers with ava gardner in 
1945 he received an academy award as best actor in 1960 for his

senior leader deng xiaoping today told the 
chairmen of some of the worlds leading corporations that china 
must be bold in its efforts to modernize and attract outside 
investment 
we should now advance against difficulties headon and 
guarantee the continuity of our policies and development the 
official xinhua news agency quoted deng as telling the members of 
chase manhattan banks international advisory committee 
i often encourage my comrades to be bolder it quoted him as 
saying in acting boldly mistakes are hardly unavoidable people 
should be allowed to make mistakes 
former us secretary of state henry kissinger counselor to the 
chase committee told a news conference after the meeting with 
deng the impression he left was china is determined to pursue 
its course and maybe accelerate it in the direction of a greater 
market component in its economy 
it was an extraordinary impressive performance on his dengs 
part said former chase manhattan chairman david rockefeller 
he spoke with great simplicity and vision on china and the world 
and confirmed my opinion and that of many others that he is one of 
the great men of this century 
chases 25member international advisory committee also met 
today with chinese communist party leader zhao ziyang and premier 
li peng 
the committee members who include the heads of major 
corportions such as italys fiat spa and the netherlands philips 
electronic giant held their biannual meeting in beijing on monday 
and today 
in addition to the top leaders they also met with minister of 
finance wang bingqian foreign minister qian qichen and foreign 
trade minister zheng tuobin 
rockefeller said their goal was not to advance individual 
business deals but to learn about chinas reforms 
deng who began chinas retreat from central planning toward a 
partially marketregulated economy in 1978 was quoted by xinhua as 
telling the businessmen that price reform has become the toughest 
problem 
the process of lifting government controls that kept prices 
artifically low has given rise to inflation that reached 11 percent 
in the first quarter of the year 
nonetheless kissinger said deng and other chinese leaders 
seemed to feel they have no other way to go if they dont want to 
be suspended in midstream in the reform process 
chase manhattan chairman willard butcher said the bank has no 
plans to take advantage of chinas recent moves to allow foreign 
banks to set up fullservice operations in china including 
accepting deposits 
foreign banks including new yorkbased chase so far have been 
limited to making loans to the government and chinese and foreign 
joint venture companies

soviet experts making their first visit 
to a secret chemical warfare facility in western europe today 
watched as british soldiers in gas masks fought off a simulated 
attack by an enemy using nerve agents 
the display marked the official start of the soviets threeday 
visit to britains chemical warfare defense center in porton down 
in southwest england 
it is part of an exchange program to promote progress on a 
chemical weapons ban it should facilitate negotations yuri 
nazarkin chief soviet negotiator at the 40nation geneva 
conference on disarmament 
the conference ended its spring session april 29 with no 
breakthrough in sight on an agreement to ban development 
production and stockpiling of chemical weapons 
after watching the display by nine british soldiers the 13 
soviet scientists and military experts entered the main buildings 
of the british facility to begin talks with british experts 
the visit a week before the superpower summit was billed by 
british officials as the most detailed exchange of information to 
date with the soviets on chemical weapons by a western european 
power 
were not going to reveal all graham pearson director of 
the facility said were going to try to build confidence 
between the united kingdom and soviet union in respect of the 
negotiations in geneva 
lt gen anatoly kuntsevich deputy commander of soviet chemical 
troops said after the display if we consider it to be a 
beginning it is interesting and purposeful 
while nuclear weapons will be the centerpiece of the summit 
progress on a chemical weapons ban has so far proven elusive 
at last decembers washington summit president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev called for intensified 
negotiations on a verifiable agreement covering all nations 
capable of producing chemical weapons 
britain which halted production of chemical weapons in the 
1950s and destroyed its stockpiles in 1957 has been in the 
forefront of the geneva conference negotiations that have dragged 
on for 20 years 
as part of the exchange british scientists and military experts 
will visit the soviet chemical warfare facility at shikhany on the 
river volga the ministry of defense said the exchange will be the 
first between the soviet union and a western european country 
focusing on chemical warfare 
the soviet union only acknowledged in early 1987 that it had a 
chemical weapons stockpile amounting to 50000 tons one major 
problem in the geneva negotiations is that western experts put the 
soviet stockpile at 300000 tons 
a british defense policy paper issued last week said the 
soviet union commands the worlds largest most comprehensive and 
advanced capability for chemical and toxic agent warfare 
the soviet capability for chemical warfare far outstrips those 
of the west and cannot be justified by any comparable threat from 
nato 
the united states the only other country that acknowledges 
possessing chemical weapons has a stockpile estimated at 30000 
tons 
it ended an 18year moratorium on production in december when it 
started manufacturing binary weapons those made from two chemicals 
which are harmless alone but lethal when they interact 
last october specialists from the geneva conference visited 
shikany where they were shown chemical weapons which seemed to 
date from the 1950s in november soviet inspectors visited a us 
army chemical weapons disposal plant at toole utah where they 
were shown techniques for destroying old gas munitions 
since britain now has no chemical weapons the soviet delegation 
will only see laboratories at porton down where toxic chemicals and 
biological agents are tested against protective equipment such as 
gas masks clothing and monitoring instruments which are developed 
for the armed forces 
the facility also tests antidotes to chemical weapons

a statement purportedly issued by the 
captors of foreigners in lebanon said today the hostages would be 
killed if their governments did not initiate direct negotiations 
with the kidnappers 
the threat was made in a typewritten arabic statement signed by 
the proiranian islamic jihad and delivered anonymously to a french 
news agency reporter in baalbek 
the east lebanon city is a traditional stronghold of hezbollah 
or party of god the proiranian group that is believed to be an 
umbrella for the captors of 18 foreign hostages in lebanon 
there was no way to verify the authenticity of the statement 
islamic jihad has said previously it would always send a picture of 
a hostage with its statements the latest statement was not 
accompanied by such a photograph 
the statement said the islamic jihad organization advises 
countries interested in the hostages problem to speed up direct 
negotiations for their safety because the application of pressures 
as well as the current plans and recipes on the ground targeting 
the islamic fervency will lead to liquidating all the hostages and 
throwing their dead corpses out 
it apparently referred to the syrian military siege of south 
beiruts slums the area where most of the foreign captives are 
believed held 
there has been no confirmed word from the kidnappers since 
fighting broke out may 6 in the southern slumbs between hezbollah 
and the syrianbacked amal militia 
the 18 hostages include nine americans longest held is 
associated press chief middle east correspondent terry anderson he 
was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the united states has said it would not negotiate with the 
kidnappers but as fighting raged last week in the slums where the 
captives are believed held washington announced it would be 
willing to talk to hezbollah 
the newspaper addiyar which is based in christian east beirut 
reported today that irans deputy foreign minister hossein 
sheikholeslam who has been mediating the amalhezbollah conflict 
has taken some foreign hostages in his motorcade to the iranian 
embassy in beirut 
the report which named no sources said sheikholeslam later 
returned some of them hostages to the suburbs after the embassy 
found out that syrian intelligence agents were watching the 
building it said two american hostages remain in the embassy 
the newspaper did not identify them 
iran denied an earlier report that foreign hostages were taken 
to the iranian embassy

a jetliner went off the runway and 
smashed through a fence while trying to take off but all 22 
passengers and crew fled the aircraft minutes before it burst into 
flames 
ten people were treated for minor injuries following the 
accident monday the lacsa boeing 727100 carried eight crew 
members and 14 passengers including seven americans 
miraculously there were no deaths said juan manuel

crashed through a fence surrounding the airport after failing to 
take off 
the plane came to a stop about 600 yards beyond the fence on a 
grassy area where it burst into flames the aircraft broke into 
three sections 
during takeoff for unknown reasons the plane left the 
runway stopping finally outside the airport boundary said the 
lacsa statement 
after the successful evacuation of all the passengers and crew 
members the plane was consumed by flames it said 
the wreckage was still blazing 1 hours after the explosion and 
wreckage was spread over a wide area 
thanks to the skill of the pilots they were able to evacuate 
the passengers just a few minutes before the plane burst into 
flames fernandez said 
copilot armando rojas told reporters that the passengers 
remained calm 
with nerves of steel we were able to evacuate all the 
passengers rojas said a few minutes later maybe five 
minutes the plane burst into flames 
in addition to the americans the passengers included a west 
german two cubans living in miami two nicaraguans and two costa 
ricans the airline said the crew was costa rican 
fernandez told reporters the cause of the explosion was under

civil aviation agency 
witnesses said flames shot up more than 130 feet after the 
explosion 
the plane broke into three parts with the cockpit in one 
section and the passenger cabin split in two witnesses said 
fernandez said the plane was 16 years old and was leased a year 
ago from avensa leasing corp a subsidiary of the venezuelan 
airline viasa 
he said the jet was not originally scheduled to be used monday 
it was put into service after another flight to miami via new 
orleans was overbooked

co in august 1978 said david jimenez a spokesman for the 
aircraft maker in seattle

hearing on television that there had been a crash he said his 
stepfather david jones was flying to miami from san jose on

the united states should accept a fair 
trade that removes gen manuel antonio noriega from power in 
exchange for dismissal of the drug indictment against the 
panamanian ruler a former american ambassador to panama said today 
if we want noriega to leave panama we cant keep up an 
indictment that simply locks him in ambler moss ambassador to 
the central american nation from 197882 said on nbctvs 
today program 
moss said the indictment against noriega was a bad mistake 
that should now be secondary to changing the political situation in 
panama 
if the rest of the package worked out to be all right for 
instance noriega departs from power a mechanism is put in place 
for free elections and other parts of the package look all right 
then it may be a fair deal moss said 
us officials have said that under one arrangement noriega 
would leave panama in august and return after the may 1989 
presidential elections they said noriega would have a hand in the 
selection of an interim government which would serve until the 
elected government takes office 
but the reagan administration has come under increasing pressure 
to halt its negotiations with noriega and vice president george 
bush moved away from the white house stance last week as the 
dealings became an issue in the presidential campaign 
noriega has remained in power even though the united states in 
february began applying pressure including economic sanctions 
sen alan cranston also interviewed on the today program 
said the noriega dealings have been a foreign policy 
embarrassment for the reagan adminstration 
there was an underestimation of noriegas determination and 
his capacity to hang on said cranston a member of the senate 
foreign relations committee 
moss said the white house has displayed poor political 
judgment in using intelligence reports from panama on noriegas 
entrenchment 
it isnt a question of not having the information but a 
question of what they did with that information they misjudged the 
character of noriega they certainly misjudged the effect of 
economic sanctions from one step to another the whole thing was 
badly mishandled moss said

striking scriptwriters and producers met for 
the first time in more than a month and talked for nearly eight 
hours but reached no agreement to end the walkout that has delayed 
the start of the fall tv season 
the afternoon session monday resulted in several closed meetings 
between a federal mediator and top negotiatiors for the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers and the striking writers 
guild of america 
the parties met under auspices of a federal mediator although 
we can report no substantive progress another meeting has been 
tentatively scheduled for wednesday said writers guild of 
america spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
before the meeting federal mediator leonard farrell told 
reporters he called for renewed bargaining simply because i 
believed it was time referring to the 12weeklong strike and 
industry job losses 
producers have said the strike has cost the industry more than 
15 million in lost jobs and production time with about 1400 
clerical workers cast and crew members laid off 
wga president george kirgo said he believed the producers were 
beginning to feel the impact of no scripts and no new 
production 
the session at the producers alliance headquarters was 
apparently more fruitful than a mediated april 18 meeting which 
ended after only 20 minutes a march 14 meeting also failed 
farrell sat down monday with kirgo wga west executive director 
brian walton east coast wga director mona mangen alliance 
president nicholas counter iii and alliance vice president carol a 
lombardini 
nearly 100 negotiators attorneys and advisers for both sides 
gathered in other conference rooms to discuss new ideas and 
proposals 
they are talking and theres plenty to talk about said 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg 
the walkout began march 7 over creative control on the set and 
residual payments for both onehour syndicated television show 
reruns and works distributed in foreign countries 
the renewed bargaining came four days before writers were 
scheduled to meet and consider whether to approve independent 
contracts which would allow some production companies to resume 
work 
about 80 companies have been negotiating for waiver contracts 
with the wga ms rhoden said she added that she had no estimate 
of how many contracts might be considered and approved by members 
leaders of the 9000member guild are recommending that west and 
east coast members ratify the independent contracts in hopes of 
shortening the walkout she said 
steinberg said the signing of the independents would not affect 
negotiations because they represent less than 10 percent of 
feature film and 15 percent of television production 
the fall television production season usually begins in late 
june or early july but approved and edited scripts in hand are 
vital for production to begin those scripts are usually being 
evaluated by this time of year

the communist party will consider at a june 
conference a proposal to limi party officials to two fiveyear 
terms but it is uncertain whether the change would apply to 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev a top official said today 
this is a big step in the development of intraparty 
democracy karl vayno party leader of the estonian republic 
said in an interview with western correspondents 
current terms for party jobs are unlimited and longevity is one 
of the key ways communist party officials build their personal 
power and maintain privileges in their city region or at the 
national level 
vayno one of the more than 300 members of the policymaking 
central committee discussed the committees meeting monday during 
a break in a session of the supreme soviet the countrys nominal 
parliament 
the central committee discussed and approved the partys 
blueprint for the june 28 special party conference which other 
officials say is shaping up as a showdown between backers of 
gorbachev seeking radical changes in the communist party and those 
who want limited changes 
other officials have said earlier that limits on terms of office 
would be considered at the party conference but vayno provided 
more detail on the proposal after it had been accepted by the 
central committee for discussion 
one proposal is to limit all elected party leaders from cities 
and local regions all the way to the ruling politburo to two 
fiveyear terms vayno said 
but he said there were other proposals to exclude certain party 
jobs including gorbachevs from the limitations he said it was 
uncertain what the conference would decide 
asked his personal view he said it depends on the 
personality 
if the vote is about gorbachev i would vote with both hands 
to exclude him vayno said 
gorbachev has urged the commuunist party to adopt means of 
ensuring turnover in top party positions and asked by the 
washington post in an interview last week whether he supported 
limited terms of office he answered yes but did not elaborate 
the central committee also agreed to place reforms in the 
electoral system for government positions before the party 
conference vayno said he did not elaborate

a sequoyah nuclear plant reactor was 
restarted today one day after shutting down for the second time 
since may 13 a tennessee valley authority spokeswoman said 
the unit 2 reactor started up at 325 am and was reconnected 
to the tva power system at 605 am said spokeswoman janice 
brady within four hours of the restart the reactor reached about 
30 percent power she said 
sequoyah was automatically shut down at 1228 am monday 
because of an instrument problem in its reactor coolant system 
said joe bynum tvas assistant manager of nuclear power 
it was the reactors second shutdown since it was restarted 11 
days ago after a 33month shutdown for safety reasons 
however tva officials said the two shutdowns were no cause for 
concern 
it was a relatively minor instrumentation problem that we can 
correct ms brady said as weve said repeatedly because of 
the complexity of any nuclear plant its not uncommon for a unit 
to automatically shut down 
bynum said the incident evaluated monday by a tennessee valley 
authority investigative team represented no danger to plant 
employees or the general public 
at the time of mondays shutdown unit 2 was approaching 75 
percent power about the same level as on may 19 when a water 
gauge problem caused the reactor to shut down 
the reactor was restarted saturday after repairs and 
adjustments plant workers were calibrating a transmitter that 
provides readings on reactor water flow when the second shutdown 
occurred 
the employees put the transmitter in the trip or off 
position then detected a trip signal from one of two other 
transmitters in the same reactor loop that indicated low water 
flow said ms brady four such loops are in each reactor 
the reactors transmitter system is designed to automatically 
shut down the reactor when two out of the three transmitters in a 
loop send trip signals she said 
when sequoyahs unit 2 went back on line may 13 it became the 
first tva reactor to do so since the federal utility shut down its 
nuclear program in august 1985 because of safety concerns 
tva tentatively expects sequoyah unit 1 to be back on line by 
september and unit 2 at browns ferry nuclear plant outside athens

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods rose 08 percent in april boosted by a jump in 
orders for military communications equipment the government said 
today 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1163 billion last month 
it was the third consecutive monthly increase and followed gains 
of 09 percent in march and 01 percent in february 
analysts had worried that declines in new orders in november and 
january indicated some softening of the economy in the wake of the 
october stock market crash but the increase in april confirmed 
most analysts views that the economy is now growing robustly most 
had expected a rise about in line with todays report 
overall orders in april were 85 percent ahead of a year 
earlier 
in april a large increase in orders for new military 
communications hardware more than offset declines elsewhere in 
electrical machinery contributing to a sharp 44 percent increase 
in that category it followed a 37 percent drop in march 
orders in the volatile defense goods category rose 14 percent 
following a big 151 percent increase in march orders excluding 
defense goods rose 08 percent to 1063 billion 
there was also strength in primary metels such as steel orders 
rose 02 percent following a 55 percent increase in march 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a good 
sign of business expansion plans rose 14 percent last month 
following a 39 percent decline but at 329 billion orders were 
still 151 percent ahead of last year 
orders for civilian aircraft particularly to boeing corp 
increased but that was more than offset by a decline in orders for 
military planes leading to an overall 03 percent decline in the 
transportation category following a 28 percent increase a month 
earlier 
there was also a decrease in orders for nonelectrical 
machinery they fell 13 percent following a 25 percent increase 
in march 
shipments of durable goods fell 11 percent in april to 1126 
billion following a 30 percent increase in march

thunderous blasts of tank and artillery 
fire jolted beirut today as fighting between shiite moslem factions 
escalated after the collapse of syrian and iranian talks aimed at 
reining in their allies 
in east beirut rightwing christian militias clashed overnight 
in a resurgence of a power struggle within the christian community 
police said one person was killed and four were wounded 
police said 15 people were killed and 42 wounded today as the 
proiranian hezbollah and the syrianbacked amal fought one of 
their heaviest duels yet in beiruts southern slums the casualties 
raised the toll since the shiite fighting broke out may 6 to 294 
killed and 993 wounded 
police said hezbollah was inching toward amals last stronghold 
in the 16squaremile enclave where most of the 18 foreign hostages 
are believed held 
there has been no confirmed news on the fate of the hostages 
since the fighting began lebanese reports have said the captives 
who include nine americans have been moved several times 
also today a statement signed by islamic jihad which claims to 
hold some hostages said the captives would be killed if their 
governments did not initiate direct negotiations with the 
kidnappers 
there was no way to verify the authenticity of the statement 
islamic jihad has said it would always send a picture of a hostage 
with its statements but no photograph accompanied the statement 
left at the home of a reporter today 
the statement said the islamic jihad organization advises 
countries interested in the hostages problem to speed up direct 
negotiations for their safety because the application of pressures 
as well as the current plans and recipes on the ground targeting 
the islamic fervency will lead to liquidating all the hostages and 
throwing their dead corpses out 
one daily addiyar which is published in christian east 
beirut reported today that two american captives are being held at 
the iranian embassy the report which did not name the hostages 
could not be verified independently 
iran last week denied that foreign hostages were being held in 
its embassy 
a police spokesman said amal militiamen withdrew today from 
positions in the ghobeiry district under a fierce barrage of 
howitzer and mortar fire 
amal fighters withdrew to the district of shiyah at the northern 
edge of south beirut said the spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing regulations 
hezbollah controlled the southern and western flanks of shiyah 
and its gunners were pounding amals threatened supply lines at the 
northern edge of the area he said 
hezbollah has managed to achieve some gains across the 
ghobeiry positions an amal communique said 
it said hezbollah gunners blasted shiyah and the surrounding 
area with 1500 shells in a ninehour barrage 
meanwhile a hezbollah statement accused amal of 
indiscriminately bombarding areas under the partys control in 
south beirut 
t54 tanks and multibarrel rocket launchers mounted on trucks 
at amal positions in shiyah poured gunfire into hezbollahs 
territory hezbollah fired back with 155mm howitzers and 120mm 
mortars 
police said both sides also traded grenades in hitandrun 
forays 
the escalation followed syrias rejection of a proposal by iran 
for the deployment of a joint peacekeeping force in the slums 
brig gen ali hammoud syrias military intelligence chief for the 
beirut area said the iranian proposal was out of the question 
such an involvement would strengthen irans influence in lebanon 
while syria is seeking to eliminate sectarian rivalries and end the 
countrys 13yearold civil war 
acting prime minister salim hoss called monday for syrian 
military intervention without delay to end the shiite militia 
fighting 
syria has had about 7500 troops 100 tanks and 400 armored 
vehicles massed around the areas narrow alleyways and cementblock 
shanties for the last 10 days the buildup came after hezbollah 
seized 90 percent of the urban battleground in the first week of 
fighting 
syria is irans main arab ally in its 7yearold war with iraq 
but hezbollahs move to dominate lebanons 12 million shiites has 
strained that alliance 
the east beirut fighting pitted president amin gemayels 
phalange party irregulars against fighters of the lebanese forces 
the christians main militia 
police said both sides used machine guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades in the duels which raged through the night the fighting 
began after lebanese forces ambushers shot and wounded nabil 
kahhaleh phalangist commander for the sin elfil district of 
beirut

in a striking display of british aplomb a bbc 
newscaster coolly read out the events of the day while her 
coanchor offscreen sat on a gay activist who burst screaming 
onto a live evening tv news broadcast 
viewers of the british broadcasting corps 6 pm newscast 
monday heard a few unintelligible howls from the woman activist and 
three fellow demonstrators protesting a new law banning the 
promotion of homosexuality 
we have rather been invaded said anchorwoman sue lawley 
after the women entered the studios at the start of the show and 
handcuffed themselves to objects around the room 
beside her coanchor nicholas witchell took action 
i found she had handcuffed herself to sues desk so i sat on 
her and put my hand over her mouth he said i thought we would 
be taken off the air but sue very calmly kept running through the 
introduction to the first piece 
miss lawley who did not flinch during the bedlam asked viewers 
to try to ignore what was going on in the background she said 
later it was a very alarming experience 
she closed the show by apologizing to viewers and telling them 
our unwelcome guests have now been taken away by the police 
tony hall bbcs editor of news and current affairs for 
television said what happened this evening was intolerable 
well make sure it doesnt happen again he said the bbc would 
investigate how the women entered the studio 
police said the four would be released because no allegations of 
criminal offenses had been made against them 
rachel cox speaking for the group said they wanted to 
interrupt the news in order to protest clause 29 which bars local 
authorities from intentionally promoting homosexuality such as 
through grants to centers for homosexuals the law took effect at 
midnight 
she said this is a further statement of lesbian defiance 
against the law last year women protesters climbed from the 
public gallery onto the floor of the house of lords during debate 
on the bill 
the clause has been criticized by homosexuals and the arts 
community as a threat to artistic freedom critics claim it could 
lead to the censorship of writers who are homosexuals 
proponents of the measure say it is intended to prevent local 
governments from using taxpayers money to teach children that 
homosexuality is acceptable

a leading soviet sociologist says citizen groups 
advocating new policies could be formed to advise the communist 
party leadership but that formation of rival political parties 
would be unconstitutional 
tatiana zaslavskaya a sociologist and party adviser said 
monday she supports the idea of social institutions or peoples 
unions to assist the nations only legal political party 
speaking at a news conference ms zaslavskaya and prominent 
political scientist fyodor m burlatsky dismissed the efforts of 
dissident groups to form a separate political party challenging the 
communist party they said the communist partys monopoly on power 
is protected by the soviet constitution 
some independent citizen panels championing causes such as 
protection of the environment and historic preservation already 
have been formed but ms zaslavskaya did not make clear to what 
degree she supports the existing groups 
she mentioned that an organization such as a peoples union 
or popular front could be formed to promote soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachevs reforms such organizations exist in other east 
european countries that are controlled by communist parties 
formation of an umbrella popular front to bring together the 
independent groups would allow the government and party to retain 
control over public debate and discussion while at the same time 
giving soviets an opportunity to take part in the political 
decisionmaking process 
a group of dissidents announced may 9 that they had formed the 
democratic union a new party to challenge the current oneparty 
system 
those who suggest forming a new party are going beyond the 
constitution burlatsky said describing those efforts as 
childhood diseases of pluralism 
the leading role of the communist party is not just 
traditional but the constitutional norm he added 
but burlatsky like zaslavskaya said gorbachevs efforts to 
introduce more democracy and openness into soviet society mean 
broader distribution of power among the people 
i dont see any social background for creation of a second 
party ms zaslavskaya commented but the communist party in 
some way should be supplemented with social institutions or peoples 
unions this would contribute to the consolidation of perestroika 
zaslavskaya appeared to criticize the partys monopoly on power 
when asked about the system for selecting the 5000 delegates to 
the june party conference she is a candidate to become a 
conference delegate 
the fact that the party delegates are selected by the party 
machinery by the party committees effects the procedure and not 
in every case can it be called a democratic effect she said 
zaslavskaya advises the party leadership and her ideas have been 
broadly incorporated into the reform campaign since gorbachev came 
to power

president reagan praised the kremlin for 
making progress across a spectrum of human rights issues but said 
the west should not expect there will be a quick radical 
transformation of the soviet system 
reagan setting the stage for summit talks in moscow with soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev said he hoped to conclude a treaty to cut 
strategic nuclear arsenals before his term expires in eight months 
but acknowledged that might not be possible 
it is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrary 
deadline that will determine the timetable reagan said 
reagan made his remarks in an address beamed across europe today 
on the united states information agencys worldnet satellite 
service the speech was taped monday in the oval office 
the president will leave washington on wednesday bound for 
helsinki finland and a fournight stopover before traveling on to 
the soviet union he will arrive in moscow on sunday and 
immediately launch his fourth summit with gorbachev 
reagan said talks with the soviet union must be guided by 
realism about what can be achieved 
we do not expect a quick radical transformation of the soviet 
system the president said we do not expect to turn a corner 
one day to find that all our problems have gone away because our 
adversary has been transformed 
we must continue to fulfill our own responsibility to stand 
firm and vigilant to provide the incentive for a new soviet policy 
in contrast to the old reagan said 
for there still remain profound political and moral 
differences between the soviet system and our own he added 
reagan and gorbachev will have five official meetings wrapping 
up their talks june 1 later that same day the two leaders and 
their wives will attend a special ballet peformance at the bolshoi 
theater and then dine at gorbachevs dacha or country home 
outside moscow 
aside from his talks with gorbachev reagan also will meet with 
monks dissidents writers artists filmmakers and students 
lending encouragement to reforms underway in the soviet union and 
expressing hope for more change 
in moscow i will welcome the progress weve seen in the human 
rights record especially since the end of 1986 reagan said he 
said more than 300 political and religious prisoners have been 
released from labor camps 
emigration still too low has improved he said 
many cases of divided families and separated spouses have been 
satisfactorily resolved and censorship of films books and other 
creative works has eased reagan said 
yet despite this progress the human rights situation in the 
soviet union and eastern europe is far from good the president 
said repressive policies persist 
peaceful demonstrations by national minorities refuseniks and 
others are still being broken up by police he added freedom 
of religion is still being denied and members of unregistered 
religious groups are still being persecuted 
he also said unofficial publications are banned dozens of 
political and religious dissenters remain imprisioned and many 
prisoners of conscience are still being held in psychiatric 
hospitals freedom of movement is still restricted 
reagan said the united states will continue to press the 
soviet union to improve its practices in these vital areas in 
short to grant full recognition of fundamental human rights

eli lilly and co has decided not to sell 
the government a potent herbicide to destroy coca plants in peru a 
decision that drew sharp criticism from the state department 
in announcing its decision monday lilly said only that while 
the company recognizes the critical importance of the us 
governments efforts against illicit drugs a number of practical 
and policy considerations preclude our participation in this 
specific program 
the indianapolisbased pharmaceutical company would not explain 
those considerations 
the sale of the herbicide reportedly would have earned lilly 25 
million 
state department officials have been planning to spray the 
herbicide tebuthiuron on tracts of coca plants in the huallaga 
valley in peru which officials say is the source of much of the 
cocaine produced in latin america 
but tebuthiuron is thought to have strong longlasting effects 
as a defoliant that causes ecological damage 
ann b wrobleski the state departments assistant secretary for 
international narcotics matters called lillys decision 
surprising and unconscionable 
ms wrobleski said monday the companys decision was perplexing

a morning flight from medellin to bogota and ended when the plane 
landed in cartagena monday night all 128 passengers and the three 
flight attendants were freed shortly after the avianca boeing 727

forced the plane to fly to panama and aruba he demanded 100000 
saying he was dying of cancer and wanted the money so he could live 
out his days happily in cuba 
the aircraft unexpectedly landed in cartagena after the flight 
crew persuaded the hijacker that they did not have enough fuel to 
reach cuba 
authorities knew nothing about the change of plans and were 
caught off guard as the jet taxied in the darkness toward the 
cartagena terminal the hijacker lowered the rear stairway jumped 
out and escaped 
the suspect was found at dawn today hiding in a swamp on the 
edge of the airport the navy said he was being examined by 
doctors 
the navy said the suspect gonzalo carreno nieto used a toy gun 
four years ago to kidnap an uncle 
carreno spent nine years in prison after being charged with 
murder lawyer guillermo garcia said he eventually was found 
innocent and set free but had become emotionally unbalanced in 
prison and turned to crime and drug abuse garcia told the radio 
network caracol 
at a news conference in cartagena pilot luis eduardo gutierrez 
said of the hijacker he wanted the 100000 so he could spend 
the last few days of his life happily he told us he had nothing to 
lose and that he would explode a grenade he carried in his hand if 
we failed to obey his instructions 
the jetliner had left medellin on a flight to bogota colombias 
capital 250 miles southeast 
shortly after takeoff passenger javier robledo said the 
hijacker gave a note to a female flight attendant robledo who was 
sitting next to the man said the stewardess led the hijacker to 
the cockpit

board the hijacker ordered the plane to panama 
the plane landed at omar torrijos international airport outside 
panama city where soldiers took up positions in ditches around the 
aircraft

through the intercom after the hijacker forced the crew to cut off 
communications with the control tower the man demanded 100000 
said capt miguel von seidlitz airport security chief 
we explained to him that because of our financial crisis that 
was impossible and he understood said von seidlitz said

communication was cut off all of a sudden the engines started and 
the plane took off

cuba dijkhoff said 
our most difficult moments came in aruba when the hijacker 
realized he couldnt get the money there either said gutierrez 
i told him that he could probably get it in cartagena and he

the pace of existing homes sales slowed in the 
first three months of 1988 as 28 states and the district of 
columbia posted declines from last years record levels a real 
estate trade group said today 
the national association of realtors said minnesota with a 393 
percent decline suffered the biggest setback of any state during 
the januarymarch period when compared with sales during the same 
period of 1987 
in all 20 states suffered declines of 10 percent or more of 
those nine states posted drops of more than 20 percent the sales 
pace picked up in 21 states and held steady in one washington 
nationally existing homes sold at an annual rate of 366 
million units during the quarter 8 percent lower than a year ago 
although there were more resale decreases than increases many 
of the declines were in comparison to a surge in sales during the 
first quarter of 1987 said john a tuccillo the realtors chief 
economist 
despite the decline association officials said sales were still 
strong they noted that sales in early 1987 were propelled by 
relatively low interest rates on fixedrate mortgages which fell 
to nineyear lows of 9 percent to 95 percent on average rates in 
the first quarter of this year were about a percentage point higher 
while sales were falling prices were rising honolulu which 
was included in the survey for the first time supplanted new york 
as the costliest housing area in the nation median prices in 
honolulu were 198400 in new york and its suburbs the median was 
186600 
they were followed by orange county calif 183300 san 
francisco 178800 and boston 176900 
the least costly housing area was louisville ky where the 
median home cost 51100 lansing mich was next at 54400 
followed by des moines iowa 54500 grand rapids mich 
55400 and oklahoma city 56500 
washington dc had the largest price jump for the quarter 
the median home cost 132400 up 247 percent when compared with a 
year ago washington was followed by hartford conn where prices 
climbed 218 percent and providence ri where prices increased 
199 percent 
tuccillo said price increases were held back somewhat in new 
york city and in other financial centers by the october stock 
market crash the increase in new york was 102 percent 
fortyfour of the 61 metro areas surveyed posted price increases 
housing prices dropped in some areas heavily dependent on either 
oil or farming oklahoma city posted the largest drop 95 percent 
followed by houston 7 percent and denver 69 percent 
nationally prices rose 41 percent to a median of 88100 
meaning half the houses sold for more and half for less 
in addition to minnesota other states with large declines in 
the pace of sales were colorado with a 314 percent drop 
arkansas down 252 percent and new hampshire down 248 percent

dartmouth college which began admitting 
women 15 years ago has changed the name of its school song from 
men of dartmouth to alma mater in response to pressure from 
alumni and female students 
the new version celebrates the presence of men and women as a 
single community on this campus james o freedman president of 
the ivy league school said monday 
a group of alumni and students two years ago began considering 
changes for the song although a campus poll last year indicated 61 
percent of the students did not want the song changed 
also changed was the opening phrase men of dartmouth which 
became dear old dartmouth 
chivalric faith was replaced with undying faith 
sons with ones and one reference to brother with 
sister 
the original lyrics were written in 1894 by dartmouth alumnus 
and poet richard hovey 
many members of the college community fought the revision and 
for the past several years whenever the song was sung shouted out 
the lyric that told dartmouth men to stand firm lest the old 
traditions fail

the soviet armys march home from 
afghanistan is being slowed by moslem guerrillas who are attacking 
troops still positioned in the eastern part of the country sources 
said today 
western diplomats based in islamabad said reports indicate 
soviet forces will not meet their deadline of withdrawing 25 
percent of their estimated 115000 troops by the end of the month 
as announced by soviet lt gen boris gromov before the may 15 
pullout began 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to support 
the countrys marxist regime 
it is difficult to see how the 25 percent withdrawal this 
month promised by gromov will be achieved said a diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
reports said afghan guerrillas have in the past week attacked 
sovietafghan convoys along the soviet withdrawal route north and 
west of the capital of kabul as well as in the eastern provinces 
near the border with pakistan 
the regime has lost 18 district towns since midmarch an 
unprecedented string of losses with tactical implications said 
the diplomat 
afghan sources in peshawar said they had no figures on the 
number of troops who have returned to soviet territory 
guerrilla commander ahmad shah masood who controls a large 
portion of the mountainous region north of kabul reportedly agreed 
not to fire on soviet troops if they withdraw peacefully 
control of the eastern part of afghanistan opens strategic new 
supply routes to the guerrillas who are slowly pushing their way 
toward the capital 
photographs of some of the captured military posts show the 
soviets left behind large amounts of weapons supplies and 
vehicles indicating they made a hasty retreat 
as soviet military support decreases afghan president najib is 
expected to concentrate his forces around kabul 
hundreds of government forces have either surrendered or 
defected to the insurgents since the soviet pullout began 
according to diplomatic sources exact figures were not available 
guerrilla leaders have said their goal is to make afghanistan a 
moslem republic

federal engineers have broadened their 
examination of alleged sudden acceleration problems in general 
motors cars adding 14 million cbody cars to the 703000 hbody 
vehicles already under study it was announced today 
the national highway traffic safety administration said it was 
opening an engineering analysis of the cbody cars 198588 model 
year oldsmobile 98s buick electras and cadillac devilles and 
fleetwoods because they can accelerate suddenly to produce a 
significant increase in engine speed and power output 
the agency said it has received 110 complaints of sudden 
acceleration in the cars allegedly resulting in 67 accidents in 
which 43 people were injured 
since november the agency has been investigating gms hbody 
cars 
the agency had received more than 500 complaints of sudden 
acceleration or throttle control problems in those cars the 
198687 oldsmobile delta 88 and buick lesabre and the 1987 pontiac 
bonneville resulting in more than 300 accidents 
an engineering analysis is the secondhighest level of 
investigation used by nhtsa in its monitoring of auto safety the 
probe of the cbody cars was opened in response to a petition by 
the center for auto safety a consumers group often at odds with 
the auto industry and its regulators 
gm was preparing a response to nhtsa said gm spokesman john 
hartnett 
as far as were concerned were cooperating with them 
hartnett said just because it is an engineering analysis and the 
petition has been granted certainly doesnt mean that there is a 
defect it is not unusual for nhtsa to do this it has been done in 
the past 
asked if there were throttle design similarities between the 
cbody and hbody cars hartnett said the company had found no 
mechanical cause for sudden acceleration in the hbody cars 
comparing the systems doesnt help anything the fact is we 
havent found anything he said 
but sam cole of the center for auto safety said the cbody and 
hbody cars share similar mechanical components and thats why 
we believe that those cars may experience a sudden acceleration 
problem that is as bad or worse than the hbody cars the cars 
use the same electronic cruise control system cole said 
other sudden acceleration engineering analyses and cases listed 
in the report involve the 198688 honda acura and sterling and the 
198687 mercedes 300e as well as two that have resulted in 
recalls the 197987 nissan 280z and 300z and the 197886 audi

only a few years ago a person with 10000 yuan 2700 was 
considered extremely rich by chinese standards now in a nation 
where the average worker still earns only about 1000 yuan 270 a 
year millionyuan earners such as liang are increasing 
liang flanked by his legal adviser and a leader of the local 
chamber of commerce said he started working as a mason at age 14 
and had only two years of formal education 
in 1980 with 54 to his name and a chinese seagullbrand 
camera he opened a shop to develop blackandwhite pictures 
working 13 hours a day he expanded the business into a brightly 
lit color photo shop with 15 employees on a main corner of this 
city of 1 million people 
he already has purchased two 35000 kodak automatic processing 
and printing machines and has imported a third machine worth 
78000 
fuzhou officials said hes the citys first entrepreneur to 
introduce foreign advanced equipment 
liang tieless and wearing a white shirt typical of chinese 
office workers said he has living expenses of about 270 a month 
and his biggest luxury is smoking 
but last year he also completed a 81000 home hidden down a 
narrow alley in the downtown area he lives there with his father 
a former glasscutter a younger sister and about 12 shop employees 
to whom he gives free room and board he is not married 
the concrete floors and walls provide a proletarian atmosphere 
but the color tv and stereo in his bedroom the chandeliers with 
blinking colored lights and the brass cuspidors in the stairways 
add a touch of luxury 
liang said his four principles are trust quality customer 
service and obedience to the law 
the chinese government also intones four principles of loyalty 
to socialism to marxistleninistmao tsetung thought to the 
dictatorship of the proletariat and to the communist party 
liang insisted there is no contradiction between the two his 
wealth he said has brought prosperity to society adding that 
he pays about 35000 a year in personal and business taxes 
no one has ever called me a capitalist he said 
liang attributed his success partly to the governments reform 
policies the people of fuzhou have a saying thanks to deng 
xiaoping with wine every day we can sing

the senates democratic and republican leaders 
said they would move today to limit debate on the superpower 
mediumrange nuclear missile treaty and predicted it could be 
approved before president reagan meets with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev next week 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said he would offer 
a cloture motion today to cut short the long series of amendments 
being offered by a small band of conservatives who oppose the pact 
it is conceivable that we could finish the work on the treaty 
by friday or saturday byrd said outside the white house after a 
bipartisan leadership meeting with reagan the chances now are 
pretty good he added theres no reason why we should have 
continued delay for the sake of delay 
byrds republican counterpart sen bob dole of kansas said he 
supported the move to cut debate and quipped that perhaps the way 
to do so would be to have reagan take jesse with him to moscow 
a reference to sen jesse helms rnc the leading treaty 
opponent 
reagan said hed have to ride on the wing dole cracked 
and somebody else said the right wing 
helms and another opponent of the accord sen gordon humphrey 
rnh showed no signs of backing off from offering a long series 
of amendments to the treaty despite an appeal on monday from 
secretary of state george p shultz 
i am at pains to understand why this administration which is 
my administration has become such a bunch of nervous nellies when 
it comes to going back to gorbachev to work out obvious defects in 
this treaty helms said 
i dont care whether we offend him or not lets get it right 
the first time speaking of reagan he added i think hes 
wrong on this treaty i think hes been misled my conscience 
will not allow me not to pursue the obvious defects of this 
treaty 
shultz went to capitol hill to deliver the message that the 
moscow summit which starts in just five days will be diminished 
if reagan is deprived of the vote of confidence that positive 
senate action on the treaty would give him 
there is a time to inquire and there is also a time to vote 
shultz told reporters after a meeting with 17 republican senators 
it would be a good thing to have it 
helms was invited to the shultz session but did not show up and 
when dole asked helms how many amendments he would offer to the 
treaty helms declined to say 
three amendments offered by treaty opponents were defeated on 
monday bringing to nine the number of attempts to change the 
documents language that have been beaten back by the senate since 
it was brought up for consideration a week ago 
first the lawmakers voted 8113 to kill a helms amendment that 
would have required the president to certify as accurate a soviet 
report on the number of triplewarhead ss20 missiles to be 
destroyed before the treaty could take effect 
the senate then voted 6826 against an amendment by sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo that would have required a change in the treatys 
text to eliminate what he said was a loophole that would have 
permitted construction of some soviet missiles 
and it rejected 815 an amendment by sen gordon humphrey 
rnh that would have put the inf treaty on hold until the united 
states and the soviet union agreed on a more farreaching pact 
providing 50 percent cuts in each sides arsenals of 
intercontinental atomic weapons 
sen william cohen rmaine said the issues raised by treaty 
opponents have been raised and resolved during long 
consideration by the senate committees on foreign relations armed 
services and intelligence 
its legitimate to raise them for public debate again but 
its necessary to resolve them cohen said he said shultz had 
warned that failure of the senate to act would diminish the 
luster of the summit and saddle reagan with the image of a 
president who cant deliver the senate on matters he believes 
strongly in 
its important for the president to have that kind of visible 
tangible support going to meet the head of the soviet union he 
said 
ratification which requires a twothirds vote of the senate 
ultimately appears assured but conservatives have sought to bring 
attention to issues like the imbalance in us and soviet 
conventional forces in europe and the problems of verifying soviet 
compliance with the pact 
the treaty signed dec 8 by reagan and gorbachev requires 
destruction within three years of all atomic missiles with ranges 
between 300 miles and 3400 miles for the soviets that includes 
400 deployed ss20s and another 250 stockpiled ss20s 
the helms amendment defeated monday focused on the number of 
ss20s reported by the soviets during debate helms maintained 
that us intelligence officials are divided on whether that number 
is accurate and cited estimates that there are as many as twice 
the reported number 
but sen richard lugar rind said reagan administration 
officials have rejected helms claim although lugar conceded it is 
difficult to prove that no ss20s are hidden 
it is akin to proving the loch ness monster doesnt exist 
lugar said 
among issues remaining to be settled is an amendment backed by 
the senates democratic majority which would require senate 
approval before any future administration could change how the 
united states interprets the inf pact the amendment stems from a 
fight between reagan and democrats over the us interpretation of 
the 1972 antiballistic missile pact the last ussoviet arms 
agreement approved by the senate

republican house members gave broad support 
today to vice president george bushs quiet break with president 
reagan on the question of whether to negotiate with panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega 
the house republican conference in a closed session with top 
bush campaign aides also discussed recent national polls showing 
the vice president trailing gov michael dukakis his likely 
democratic opponent in the fall presidential election 
rep lynn martin of illinois vice chairman of the conference 
said that almost to a person the gop house members said they 
were pleased about the separation on noriega 
bush indicated through aides last weekend that he opposed 
negotiating with noriega the administration is trying to get the 
panamanian general to relinquish power and reportedly has offered 
to drop drug charges against him as part of a deal 
as for the polls showing dukakis leading bush martin said 
there wasnt anybody up screaming my god weve got the 
titanic but she did say the seas are rough 
robert teeter pollster for the bush campaign said current 
polls have him behind 
however he said he told the house members were in a very 
artificial period that period when dukakis has been rolling along 
what youve got to do is get past this california primary before 
people begin to focus on it 
we have bad polls said martin if this were october wed 
be suicidal but this is may 
martin said much of the discussion concerned how do we get the 
george bush we know apparent to the american people 
she said that because dukakis was in a race against jesse 
jackson hes been allowed to be defined as a moderate

president reagans decision to stop in finland 
for three days before the moscow summit sent his hosts scurrying 
for ways to entertain him in grand style they even promised him an 
audience with santa claus 
st nick lives in rovaniemi a snowy town snuggled against the 
arctic circle in finnish lapland according to finlands tourist 
board and the local postmen who received 354136 letters addressed 
to santa in 1987 
when finnish prime minister harri holkeri visited the white 
house recently he proposed a meeting between reagan and santa 
during the presidents threenight stopover in helsinki 
but theres no finnish santa claus on reagans schedule 
instead reagans sojurn in helsinki beginning early thursday 
will become one of those predominantly private study rest and 
jetlag recovery stops that have become a presummit tradition of 
the 77yearold chief executive 
except for a brief visit with finnish government leaders and a 
single speech reagan will be nestled in a government guest house 
with his briefing books and advisers boning up on strategy for his 
may 29june 2 talks with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in 
moscow 
the finns had hoped to provide a showy round of events for 
reagan the first president to visit finland since gerald r ford 
traveled to helsinki in 1975 to sign a european security and human 
rights accord 
however keeping a low profile is something the finns can relate 
to 
theyre hard to find among the birch trees up there and they 
like it that way a us official said 
for more than four decades finland has managed through 
softspokenness compromise and neutrality to share a border almost 
800 miles long with the soviet union and remain an independent 
prosperous and democratic nation 
in the late 1940s when moscow to use cold war rhetoric 
gobbled up eastern europe finnish leaders made clear they would 
fight overt aggression as they had resisted soviet attack in the 
winter war of 193940 
at the same time they assured stalin they would remain outside 
the western sphere of influence and accommodate soviet interests 
a bargain that preserved finnish autonomy but gave finland a 
reputation in the united states as a subject nation an object of 
pity 
it is commonplace to believe that finns live on the razors 
edge at the mercy of their powerful neighbor former 
highranking finnish diplomat max jakobson wrote in his 1985 book 
finland myth and reality 
it seems bizarre in western eyes he wrote that finland could 
be a neutral country yet remain faithful to a pact that envisages 
military cooperation with the soviet union it seems weird that a 
scandinavian democracy could live in apparent harmony with its 
communist neighbor 
this looks to some foreign observers like the indian rope 
trick a clever thing to do but not quite believable jakobson 
said 
commercial policy provides an example of how it works finland 
has a free open and prosperous economy but it has an agreement 
with the soviet union to keep trade at a balanced level it runs 
its commerce with the soviets through a state trading company a 
practice no other western country follows 
coincidentally the 2 billion a year in finnishus trade is 
roughly balanced as well 
the evenhanded policy seems to include highlevel visits and 
celebrations of anniversaries reagan will be in finland this week 
while gorbachev is coming in the fall 
the finns and the russians are celebrating the 40th anniversary 
of their treaty of friendship cooperation and mutual assistance 
this year the united states and finland are commemorating the 
350th anniversary of the arrival in america of the first finns who 
landed with other scandinavians in what is now wilmington del 
even then the finns were keeping a low profile the colony was 
called new sweden

the united states and soviet union remain 
locked in a nuclear arms race at sea that has pushed the number of 
naval nuclear warheads to more than 16000 worldwide according to 
a private study released tuesday 
while the navies of england france and china also are 
nuclearized possessing a combined 642 nuclear warheads it is 
the two superpowers which are responsible for the large warhead 
count the study said 
as of last december the united states had 9277 nuclear 
warheads assigned to its navy while the soviet union had 6152 for 
its fleet of those superpower totals 6350 of the warheads are 
shortrange nonstrategic weapons that are not covered by any 
type of arms control treaty the study found 
the study nuclear warships and naval nuclear weapons a 
complete inventory was published by the institute for policy 
studies and the environmental group greenpeace 
it was authored by william m arkin the director of the 
national security program at the institute and a research 
associate joshua handler the institute is a liberal think tank 
based in washington that frequently has criticized the 
administrations military policies 
the study lists the individual ships in the five navies that 
have been certified to carry or fire nuclear weapons and arkin 
predicted it could accelerate international debate about allowing 
nucleararmed ships to make port calls 
the 95page report by providing such specific information also 
attacks the official us navy policy of never confirming or 
denying the presence of nuclear weapons arkin said 
the navy argument that the policy bolsters deterrence is just 
baloney because the ships certified to carry nuclear weapons can 
be identified arkin said 
i dont think many people have any idea that here are 16000 
nuclear warheads at sea onequarter to onethird of the total in 
the world he continued 
but the naval proliferation of nuclear weapons is becoming a 
matter of concern to foreign governments and i believe there is a 
growing interest and sense that controls are needed for naval 
nuclear weapons arkin said 
according to the report the five navies currently deploy 14 
types of longrange ballistic missiles on 17 types of submarines 
that combined arsenal of strategic weaponry now totals 1792 
missiles with 9487 warheads 
on the nonstrategic or shortrange side the largest single 
category of nuclear weaponry is deployed for antisubmarine 
warfare according to arkin there are now 3300 such asw weapons 
in the fleets of the united states soviet union and britain 
shortrange nuclear weapons also have been deployed for use 
against enemy aircraft other ships and targets on land the study 
said the united states and soviet union so far have deployed a 
combined 548 nuclear warheads on sealaunched cruise missiles and 
another 541 warheads on antiaircraft missiles 
the nuclear arms race at sea is longstanding and 
accelerating the study concluded as of the end of 1987 1101 
ships and submarines and over 3250 aircraft could fire 
transport or service one or more of these nuclear weapons 
and all of the nuclear powers have ongoing nuclear research 
and development programs and are producing new naval nuclear 
weapons as well as the ships aircraft and missiles that carry or 
launch nuclear warheads

vice president george bush got a bit of support from 
congressional republicans today and prepared to add idahos 18 
delegates to his victory total on the way to the gop presidential 
nomination michael dukakis was expected to beat jesse jackson in 
idahos nonbinding democratic primary 
officials in idaho said a low turnout was likely in the polling 
today 
dukakis was tending to gubernatorial tasks in massachusetts 
today and traveling to virginia for an evening appearance bush 
was in washington preparing to see president reagan off later this 
week for next weeks superpower summit in moscow 
on capitol hill the house republican conference met with bush 
campaign aides in a closed session during which they discussed such 
matters as bushs standing in the polls and his stance on the 
administrations negotiations with panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
rep lynn martin of illinois vice chairman of the conference 
said the gop house members said they were pleased about the 
separation on noriega 
bush indicated through aides last weekend that he opposed 
negotiating with noriega the administration trying to get noriega 
to relinquish power reportedly has offered to drop drug charges 
against him as part of a deal 
as for the polls showing dukakis leading bush martin said 
there wasnt anybody up screaming my god weve got the 
titanic but she did say the seas are rough 
jackson campaigning again today in california released a 
budget plan on monday that would raise taxes on the rich freeze 
defense spending and boost support for social programs 
the fiveyear proposal would hike taxes on the wealthy by 244 
billion and on corporations by 104 billion it would cut the 
defense budget by 164 billion by freezing projected spending 
hikes and would increase spending on social programs by 344 
billion 
jackson said his plan would cut the nations deficit from a 
projected 134 billion in 1993 to 49 billion 
dukakis did not take issue with the specifics of jacksons 
spending plan but said his own experience as governor had taught 
him that budgets cannot be mapped out in such detail years ahead of 
time 
theres no way you can prepare a budget today for 1989 said 
dukakis who is struggling to cope with changing revenue 
projections at home in massachusetts the governor also brushed 
aside jacksons criticism of his own economic proposals as 
radically conservative 
it does represent a fundamental change dukakis said of his 
spending policy which has been expressed in much more general 
terms than jacksons 
dukakis comments came during a quick visit monday night to new 
jersey which holds its primary on june 7 the same day as 
california new mexico and montana also hold primaries that day 
jackson has been stumping hard in california whose 
seasonclosing contest offers him a last chance to demonstrate his 
clout as the democratic party prepares for its convention 
beginning july 18 in atlanta 
dukakis expects the contests of june 7 will lock in the number 
of delegates he needs for the nomination 
the massachusetts governor has been raking in delegates nearly 
four times as fast as jackson in the last month in the past 30 
days dukakis has claimed 590 delegates to jacksons 147 
all told dukakis has 1665 delegates to jacksons 983 
according to the latest ap delegate count 
jackson is tacitly acknowledging his chances of capturing the 
nomination are now practically nil but with moves like the release 
of his budget plan he is working to ensure that his ideas have an 
impact on the democratic platform and that his voice is heard in 
atlanta 
jackson who generally gets a friendly reception from workers 
drew a hostile response when he told workers at the rancho seco 
nuclear power plant outside sacramento on monday that the nuclear 
power industry is a dangerous job option 
the rancho seco plant is the target of a voter referendum 
seeking to shut it down permanently the workers booed when jackson 
brought up the dangers of nuclear power 
jackson also visited a childcare center on monday and recalled 
his own early years as the child of an unmarried teenage mother 
she later married a man who legally adopted jackson 
dukakis too visited a childcare center he told about 50 
parents at the cranford child care center in new jersey some of 
them with toddlers in tow that the government must work with 
businesses and labor unions to make child care affordable 
the governor pointed to such a program in his home state saying 
it has proved to companies that good child care is good 
business

new jersey officials today began legal 
action to take control of the troubled jersey city schools system 
saying local administrators have repeatedly failed to improve 
education for the districts 32000 students 
the states action could result in the biggest seizure of its 
kind in the nation 
education commissioner saul cooperman based his decision on an 
independent auditors report that is heavily critical of the local 
board of education district administrators and school principals 
political patronage union pressure and cronyism is a 
consistent motivation at all levels in the hiring firing and 
promoting of staff cooperman said in an order in which he 
formally notified the district of his takeover plans 
leslie silberman a spokeswoman for the jersey city board of 
education said the panel would not comment on coopermans 
recommendation until they had time to read the report 
during the investigation the department found an 
overwhelming failure of the school system we have documented 
example after example of the jersey city school districts chronic 
failure said assistant commissioner walter j mccarroll 
cooperman signed an order monday requiring the district to 
accept the decision within 10 days or respond with reasons why it 
should not be taken over 
if a state takeover is achieved cooperman would be empowered to 
fire jersey city schools superintendent franklin williams top 
administrators and the entire board of education which is 
appointed by the mayor 
the report also said the individual schools in the industrial 
city are disorganized and mismanaged 
the department has gone to court to seek an emergency order that 
will give it veto power over personnel and fiscal matters in the 
district cooperman said mccarroll said the action was taken 
monday in an effort to maintain the status quo while the 
takeover dispute is resolved 
a hearing on the states request is scheduled for june 7 
cooperman began a nationwide search several weeks ago for a 
superintendent the state can appoint to oversee the district in the 
event of a takeover 
the national governors association said a takeover in jersey 
city would be the first time a state took control of such a large 
urban system new jerseys thirdlargest 
mayor anthony cucci will not fight a takeover aide robert ricci 
said 
the mayor is saying here are the keys come on in ricci 
said 
i think any change will be good said linda smith a math 
teacher but she said there were no guarantees even with state 
control 
you look at this place and everything is falling apart says 
denise perez a senior at lincoln high school theres grafitti 
all over the walls security guards in the halls it doesnt make 
you very enthusiastic about coming to school 
the takeover law enacted five months ago gives new jersey 
officials some of the broadest powers in the nation to take control 
of troubled districts 
the state can fire the local board of education superintendent 
and top administrators and appoint someone to operate the district 
for at least five years 
under the law troubled districts are given three chances to 
improve but jersey city was not given a third chance because state 
officials said city officials either were unwilling or incapable of 
making improvements 
educators locally and on a state level have urged the state to 
step in 
williams would be the first person replaced by the state and has 
vowed to fight a takeover williams who declined request for 
interviews has said his district has been unfairly singled out 
he noted that a third of his districts students come from 
singleparent families and hundreds more live in homeless shelters 
many students come from homes in which english is not the primary 
language 
he has recommended more state funding 
kentucky south carolina texas and new mexico have laws 
allowing state takeovers of failing school districts laws in 
illinois and arkansas let the state eliminate deficient districts 
an ohio law allows the state to revoke a troubled districts 
charter and georgia officials may impose heavy financial penalties 
on such districts

a panamanian opposition leader said today the 
deal being negotiated by the reagan administration for a political 
settlement in panama would be turned down by forces opposed to 
ruler manuel antonio noriega 
if a deal is approved by president reagan and noriega forces 
opposed to the military chieftain will reject the deal there 
will be no peace in panama the turmoil will continue ambassador 
juan b sosa said 
the ambassador who continues to occupy his nations embassy 
despite being fired by noriega said the deal under negotiation 
between us and panamanian negotiators does not call for a 
revamping of the panamanian defense forces thus enabling the 
criminal empire noriega has created within that institution to 
wield power even if he departs the country 
sosa confirmed many of the previously reported details of the 
proposed agreement he said noriega would resign as commander of 
the defense forces in august then leave the country for an 
extended period while preparations are made for elections in may 
1989 
sosa criticized the administration for negotiating subjects with 
noriega that go well beyond bilateral issues 
he said it is improper for us negotiators to discuss panamas 
political future 
under the plan now under negotiation panamanian president 
manuel solis palma would continue on chief of state while the 
united states would recognize ousted president eric arturo 
delvalle sosa said 
he said the plan would not guarantee free elections in 1989 nor 
would it ensure an end to the systematic corruption that 
currently exists 
no deal is better than a bad deal he said 
in a statement issued monday from hiding delvalle and his 
allies said the negotiations with noriega as reported in the 
media would mortgage the future of panama for a long time to 
come 
the statement was issued through the prodelvalle panamanian 
embassy in washington by delvalle and panamas democratic 
forces 
the administations chief panama negotiator michael g kozak 
was ordered back to panama late sunday by the white house to 
continue negotiations with noriega even though vice president 
george bush has counseled against any dealings with drug dealers 
whether foreign or domestic 
delvalle was forced out of office after he tried to fire noriega 
as head of the panamanian defense forces delvalle continues to 
receive us backing as the legitimate president of panama but the 
statement indicated he believes the administration has made too 
many concessions in its negotiations with noriega 
it said noriega would be able to to continue to exercise 
authority even after resigning as defense chief unless the defense 
forces are revamped 
us officials who have described the negotiating process have 
not suggested that a major overhaul of the defense forces is 
contemplated 
the embassy statement also demanded the immediate exit of 
noriega from panama suggesting unhappiness with the august 
departure date now planned 
the us officials have said that as foreseen in the 
negotiations noriega would leave panama in august and return after 
the may 1989 presidential elections they said noriega would have a 
hand in the selection of an interim government which would serve 
until after the elected government takes office 
the embassy statement called for delvalles reinstatment as 
president and for the formation of a government of national 
reconciliation 
noriega the de facto panamanian ruler who is under 
drugsmuggling indictments in the united states has successfully 
resisted prolonged us pressure to force him out 
there is a sharp division within the administration over what 
kind of deal noriega should be offered and particularly whether 
the government should go ahead with an offer to drop the drug 
charges

nato ministers meeting later this week in 
europe are expected to formally ask italy to accept 72 us air 
force jet fighters being evicted from spain the pentagons no 2 
official said tuesday 
deputy defense secretary william h taft iv told the house armed 
services committee he expects italy will then agree to be host to 
the 401st tactical fighter wing 
defense ministers of the 16 north atlantic treaty organization 
nations meeting thursday and friday in brussels will probably 
approve the funds needed for the relocation of the f16 planes he 
said 
italy had expressed willingness to deploy the wing after the 
spanish government bowing to internal political pressure asked 
for its removal late last year but the italians insisted that nato 
make a formal request and finance the move expected to cost some 
500 million 
one of the sites under discussion for the new deployment is the 
italian air force base at goia delle colle on the adriatic coast of 
southern italy a defense official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
american presence in the impoverished region may be easy to sell 
to the italian public because of the economic advantages it would 
bring 
defense secretary frank carlucci had given nato until august to 
reach a decision about the 401st saying that otherwise he would 
order the wing and its estimated 5000 personnel sent back home and 
deactivated 
carlucci who will attend the brussels meeting en route to the 
superpower summit in moscow is then scheduled to visit south korea 
and japan 
taft said carlucci has every confidence that korean 
officials will be prepared to respond with specific increased 
funding levels for their programs at that time 
taft did not say what aid the united states is expecting beyond 
the 100 million in direct contributions south korea gives annually 
to support the 43000 american troops on the korean peninsula 
privately us officials say that while they have not asked 
south korea for specific sums they expect an offer of no more than 
60 million annually the officials point out that south korea 
contributes more than 1 billion to the us presence annually in 
indirect costs such as real estate and personnel 
taft said that on a visit to south korea earlier this month he 
suggested they increase their contribution in support of our 
common defense efforts against north korea as well as the growing 
soviet regional presence 
the united states has been urging such asian countries as south 
korea and japan to increase their defense spending in the face of 
their successful economic performance and the decline in the us 
spending allowance 
taft said he was very encouraged by japans reaction to his 
pitch when he stopped in tokyo earlier this month he said he would 
visit there again this fall following carluccis trip and i hope 
well have something very good to tell you 
taft said nato of which japan is not a member had reacted with 
extraordinary speed in setting up a panel to review each 
countrys contribution to the alliance the defense ministers in 
brussels will probably vote to submit a report on the review in 
december he said 
the nato review board was set up in response to growing 
sentiment in congress that alliance members whose economies are 
improving should carry more of the defense burden and stop relying 
on the united states to make up the shortfall

the controversy over the bugriddled new us 
embassy and repercussions over the spying scandal at the old 
complex continue as president reagan prepares to visit the soviet 
capital for his fourth summit with mikhail s gorbachev 
but officials say reagan is unlikely to broach the subject at 
the summit 
i dont see an issue that needs to come up on the embassy 
right now said robert e lamb assistant secretary of state for 
diplomatic security 
we have talked to the russians and have told them they 
have an obligation to let us get a secure embassy where we can do 
our business in moscow he said in an interview 
but rep dan mica dfla chairman of a house subcommittee on 
international operations and a past critic of security in moscow 
said reagan should seize the opportunity to talk about the 
embassy bugging and the cost of replacing the building 
two separate events came to a head and attracted widespread 
public and congressional attention in the spring of 1987 
the first involved the existing embassy which the united states 
acquired in 1952 sensational allegations were aired that marine 
guards had allowed kgb agents to roam the secure areas of the 
building 
following those reports a presidential panel headed by former 
defense secretary melvin r laird concluded that conditions at the 
embassy were seedy and disgraceful security breaches easily 
could have occurred in the building the panel said 
over the past year lamb said the vulnerabilities in the 
building have been corrected there were some holes and we have 
moved to fill them 
besides upgrading counterintelligence at the embassy 
technicians swept the area for bugs and removed electronic 
equipment like typewriters and computers upgrading the embassy 
cost about 50 million mica said 
lamb also said some of the reports of spying at the embassy have 
proven to be false 
there is no evidence that marines allowed the soviets into the 
embassy he said one embassy guard sgt clayton j lonetree 
was convicted of espionage for giving the kgb the identities of cia 
agents and the floor plans to the us embassies in moscow and 
vienna 
but charges that lonetree and cpl arnold bracy permitted kgb 
agents to wander through the embassys secure areas were dropped by 
government prosecutors 
the second concern centers around the bugriddled new 
eightstory embassy building that was scheduled to be finished next 
year under a 1972 agreement the americans allowed soviet 
construction crews to do work on the building which is part of a 
191 million complex 
i am deeply concerned over the breach of security in our 
moscow embassy and while all the facts are not known it is clear 
that security implications are widespread and that additional quick 
action is required to prevent further damage to our national 
security reagan said on april 7 1987 
the united states will not occupy our new embassy building in 
moscow unless and until i can be assurred that it is safe to move 
into a secure embassy environment he vowed 
secretary of state george p shultz has ordered a study of his 
options tearing the building down neutralizing it and leaving it 
intact or taking off some of the floors lamb said the study should 
be complete in the fall 
with reagan leaving office in january it is likely his 
successor will have to deal with the problem of what to do about 
the building 
while the embassy issue may be played down at the summit 
security will be a priority lamb said the diplomatic security 
office and the secret service work together to provide security for 
the presidential entourage 
to block the kgb from gaining us secrets technicians will 
ship over special impenetrable steel rooms akin to huge 
refrigerators officials said they will also use encryption 
equipment so americans can communicate with washington

the main opposition party tuesday 
blamed us interference in domestic affairs and the governments 
humiliating subservience to the united states for recent 
attacks on us diplomatic posts 
the party for peace and democracy led by former presidential 
candidate kim daejung said recent antius protests were caused 
in part by attempts to subordinate korean policy to us interests 
but the oppositon party called on protesters to halt violent 
attacks on us diplomatic offices and said it did not endorse 
calls for the removal of american troops from south korea 
although we understand the feelings of the students we 
strongly ask them not to use violence under any circumstances 
the opposition party said in its harshest criticism of the united 
states in recent months 
students have attacked us diplomatic posts in seoul and the 
southern city of kwangju since violent protests began wednesday to 
mark the eighth anniversary of a civil uprising in the southern 
city of kwangju 
the dissidents have called for the overthrow of president roh 
taewoo and the removal of 42000 us troops based in south korea 
under a mutual defense pact 
protesters hurled firebombs and rocks at the us information 
service building in kwangju on monday and threw homemade bombs at 
the us embassy in seoul on friday after an attack on the nearby 
us information service office the day before 
on tuesday scattered clashes continued in kwangju 165 miles 
south of seoul when riot police fired tear gas to stop some 1200 
students trying to march on two campuses 
in seoul 2000 students from three universities battled riot 
police tuesday at a university campus shouting antigovernment and 
antius slogans there there were no reports of injuries or 
arrests 
prime minister lee hyunjae on tuesday promised action after the 
governing democratic justice party called for tighter security to 
protect us diplomatic facilities 
the government and opposition parties agreed to form special 
committees during the national assemblys first special session in 
june to investigate the kwangju incident and corruption under 
former governments 
but kim daejungs party urged the government and the united 
states to study why antius protests were increasing and to take 
steps to end repressive rule and other unpopular policies 
the recent protests kims party said were caused by us 
policies that emphasize its own national interests and the south 
korean governments humiliating subservience toward the us 
us officials have consistently denied their government had 
anything to do with the nineday kwangju uprising in which about 
200 people were killed when the army suppressed the protests 
dissidents contend the united states condoned the action and that 
south korea covered up the brutality of the soldiers

heres the latest bulletin from tass the official 
soviet news agency is going into the souvenir tshirt button 
record and cassette business just in time for the summit 
tass announced tuesday night that it has entered into an 
agreement with a washington firm to design produce and distribute 
souvenirs of the may 29june 2 meetings here between mikhail s 
gorbachev and president reagan 
tass director general sergei losev said his agency was venturing 
into the souvenir market for the first time and that it makes 
good sense for american companies and soviet organizations to work 
together especially during the planning for such an important 
event as the summit 
the us partner in the business was identified as kavulich 
international inc 
tass said the companys chairman john s kavulich ii praised 
the joint souvenir operation and said it demonstrates the desire 
of the soviet union to learn more about western marketing methods 
the tshirts to be produced have a fourcolor design on the 
front which tass did not describe and a new tass top 20 logo 
on the back to promote a new music rating program the news agency 
plans 
the souvenirs will be sold at moscow hotels and at selected 
stores within the united states tass said 
buttons audio cassettes and record albums also will be 
produced tass said without providing details 
central planning in the soviet union has prevented most 
industries from capitalizing on shortterm business prospects such 
as souvenir sales during events like the summit but economic 
reforms introduced by gorbachev have allowed more flexibility by 
individual enterprises and agencies and the tass project is an 
outgrowth of those reforms

jesse jackson will spend between 500000 and 
750000 on tv commercials starting next week in california his 
campaign manager said tuesday 
voters in california and three other states wind up the long 
democratic primary season on june 7 
jacksons campaign chairman willie brown the california 
assembly speaker had earlier said that the budget would be more 
than 2 million but campaign manager gerald austin said that 
figure might encompass the total campaign budget for advertising 
staff and other costs 
i never thought to spend 2 million on tv he said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles but he said the 750000 
estimate may go up if some additional money comes in 
the jackson campaign which has improved its fundraising to a 
4millionamonth operation is paying staff members at offices in 
37 of californias 45 congressional districts and thus has other 
financial commitments to meet he said 
the california commercials will start on may 31 one week before 
the election austin said it has not been decided whether new ones 
will be produced or the campaign will recycle some of the ones it 
has used throughout the campaign 
in new jersey which also holds a primary on june 7 along with 
california montana and new mexico there will be no expenditures 
for tv he said but the campaign is buying some radio time the 
overall campaign budget in new jersey is about 250000 austin 
said 
new jersey viewers already got a good dose of jackson ads 
because they are in the markets where he aired commericals during 
the new york and pennsylvania primaries austin said

a federal magistrate ruled tuesday that the 
honduran ambassador to panama must remain in jail on cocaine 
charges and a prosecutor said the suspect apparently was a 
mule who simply transported the drug 
rigoberto regalado lara 49 was arrested may 15 at miami 
international airport after 26 pounds of cocaine was discovered in 
his luggage 
he was immediately stripped of his diplomatic immunity by 
honduran officials who said he would also be prosecuted there if 
he returned home 
assistant us attorney odilio diaz said following tuesdays 
hearing before us magistrate samuel smargon that there is no 
evidence regalado was a major player in the drug trade 
right now it looks as if all he is is a typical mule who just 
happened to be a honduran ambassador said diaz a mule is a 
lowlevel figure who carries the drugs across borders 
but regalados attorney david rothman said his client was 
innocent and he had proof 
there is a witness in honduras who can provide a reasonable 
and innocent explanation for the presence of the cocaine rothman 
said regalado will plead innocent rothman said 
he sought unsuccessfully to have his client freed from the 
metropolitan correctional center where regalado has been held 
since his arrest 
but diaz called the ambassador an extreme risk of flight 
noting that if regalado fled to honduras he could not be 
extradited back to the united states 
smargon ordered regalado to remain in custody without bond but 
said the issue could be raised again at an arraignment hearing 
scheduled tuesday

faced with a studio invasion by four screaming gay 
rights activists a bbctv newscaster coolly delivered the evening 
news while her resourceful coanchor grappled with one of the women 
and silenced her offscreen 
the women protesting a new law concerning homosexuality rushed 
into the studio shouting just as the british broadcasting corps 
six oclock news went on the air monday night 
puzzled viewers however heard only a few unintelligible howls 
in the background as anchorwoman sue lawley unflinchingly proceeded 
with the news of the day 
offcamera as the invaders ran around handcuffing themselves to 
pieces of equipment coanchor nicholas witchell saw a woman run 
toward miss lawleys desk 
i found she had handcuffed herself to sues desk so i sat on 
her and put my hand over her mouth he said i thought we would 
be taken off the air but sue very calmly kept running through the 
introduction to the first piece 
miss lawley asked viewers to ignore what was going on in the 
background and in her usual pleasant tone said we have rather 
been invaded 
she closed the show by apologizing to viewers and telling them 
our unwelcome guests have now been taken away by the police 
later she said it was a very alarming experience 
bbc security men handed the four women over to police who 
released them without charge later monday 
british newspapers carried admiring stories of the two cool 
newscasters on their front pages and ron neil bbcs deputy 
director of news and current affairs said presenting the news 
which is live is the most difficult of tasks in normal conditions 
to carry on through that kind of unnerving and unpredicted invasion 
shows a superb level of professionalism 
the bbc said tuesday it would review and change its security 
measures at the television center studio in west london 
this group used deception to get into the premises and had 
carefully planned their demonstration said a bbc spokeswoman 
an inquiry has taken place and there will be a slight change in 
security practices 
she did not give any details but press association the british 
domestic news agency said the women were believed to have bluffed 
their way past the security guards by asking for a fictitious name 
at the gate 
unable to find the person in the building directory the guard 
told them to go to the reception area in the main building and 
they were unchallenged as they went through the building to find 
the news studio the agency said 
one of the invaders rachel cox said monday the group was 
trying to draw attention to the controversial clause 29 which went 
into effect at midnight monday barring local authorities from 
promoting homosexuality such as through grants to centers for 
homosexuals 
this is a further statement of lesbian defiance ms cox 
said 
on feb 2 women protesters slid down ropes from the public 
gallery onto the floor of the house of lords during debate on the 
bill and on march 8 five women chained themselves to the gates of 
buckingham palace to protest the clause 
the legislation has been criticized by homosexuals and the arts 
community as a threat to artistic freedom critics claim it could 
lead to the censorship of writers who are homosexuals 
proponents of the measure say it is intended to prevent local 
governments from using taxpayers money to teach children that 
homosexuality is acceptable

washington with its many memorials to war 
heroes needs a monument to a man of peace mohandas k gandhi 
congress was told tuesday 
the same message was voiced by a parade of witnesses testifying 
in favor of legislation to reauthorize construction of a gandhi 
memorial on governmentowned land in the capital 
gandhi indias apostle of nonviolence and civil disobedience 
was assassinated in 1948 and congress authorized a gandhi memorial 
the next year but the authorization expired before the thensmall 
indianamerican community could raise enough money said rep 
mervyn m dymally dcalif author of new legislation cosponsored 
by 74 house members 
a memorial to gandhi and his philosophy would be especially 
important as an inspiration for the millions of children who visit 
washington dymally told a house administration subcommittee 
at a time when ethnic strife is rampant in many parts of the 
world and nations spend significant amounts of wealth on 
amrmaments the preservation of gandhis spirit and message has 
become a mandate he said 
dymallys bill authorizes construction of the memorial at no 
cost to the government by the indianamerican forum for political 
education a nonpartisan organization that teaches americans of 
asian indian ancestry about their adopted homeland

a top us diplomat has criticized remarks by 
syrias envoy to the united nations as antisemitic and racist 
in a letter monday to edgar bronfman president of the world 
jewish congress assistant secretary of state richard williamson 
said the antisemitic statement by the syrian representative 
was an unaccaptable use of the un security council as a 
platform for spewing racism 
williamson was referring to a statement by syrian ambassador 
fachi almasri on may 6 at the un security council during a 
debate about an israeli incursion into southern lebanon 
almasri said israels presence in south lebanon is aimed at 
creating a state of psychosis that will compel the inhabitants of 
southern lebanon to abandon their lands and property thereby 
giving a free hand to the expansionist policy of the world jewish 
congress with israel as its agent 
the wjc an international organization which defends the rights 
of jews and other minorities wrote a protest letter to un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar expressing outrage at 
this vile expression of antisemitism 
williamson assured bronfman the united states would remain 
alert to the possibility of such statements in the future and 
where appropriate will respond accordingly 
at last months un human rights commission meeting in geneva 
the wjc demanded that syria expel alois brunner who was a senior 
nazi officer in world war ii and now lives in damascus

after hearing cockfights condemned as a 
blood sport and praised as an economic plus for louisiana a senate 
committee on tuesday turned aside legislation to outlaw the 
practice 
by a 21 vote two bills by sen sydney nelson were deferred by 
a judiciary committee nelson said he would decide whether to bring 
up a bill allowing parishes to ban cockfighting after the house 
hears similar legislation 
it took several years to outlaw dogfighting and it may take 
several years to outlaw cockfighting but i think we will 
ultimately prevail he said 
nelsons legislation would have made cockfighting a misdemeanor 
punishable by a fine of up to 500 and a sixmonth jail sentence 
louisiana new mexico arizona and oklahoma are the only states 
that have not banned cockfighting 
nelson who called cockfighting a blood sport presented a 
petition with more than 2000 signatures calling for the ban the 
bill also was backed by several sheriffs and police chiefs 
animal activists have long condemned cockfighting birds that 
participate are specially bred and equipped with a razor to inflict 
serious or fatal wounds 
bob baker a field investigator for the humane society of the 
united states called cockfighting very degrading and 
dehumanizing he said breeders often use illegal drugs to make 
their birds fight 
however a representative of the united gamefowl breeders 
association said cockfighting buffs come from all respectable 
walks of society and have included george washington thomas 
jefferson andrew jackson and abraham lincoln 
bob guilbeau a lafayette restaurant owner said cockfighting 
brings tourists to louisiana my business enjoys its five busiest 
weekends when the sunset recreation club a cockfighting 
establishment has its meetings he said

ticks in an urban park were the likely culprits 
behind four confirmed cases of rocky mountain spotted fever one 
fatal in new york city last summer doctors said 
usually a hazard of the suburbs and countryside the fever 
apparently was contracted by four new yorkers near where they lived 
in the bronx according to thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
there are many dangers of life in new york city but until now 
they have not included rocky mountain spotted fever dr david t 
durack of duke university commented in an editorial in the journal 
a team headed by dr miklos p salgo of albert einstein college 
of medicine in new york reported tracking down the probable cause 
ticks in the bronx soundview park that carried bacteria 
responsible for the fever 
one victim a 10yearold boy died of the infection 
the disease can be stopped if treated quickly with antibiotics 
the doctors said physicians should consider rocky mountain spotted 
fever whenever trying to diagnose unexplainable feverish illnesses 
even if the patients havent traveled to places where the disease 
is common 
the disease is most frequent in the south atlantic and south 
central states about 3 percent to 6 percent of recognized cases 
are fatal

a ranking official said tuesday the communist 
party may limit leaders to two fiveyear terms ending the 
perpetual tenure that cements personal power but he did not 
indicate it would apply to mikhail s gorbachev 
this is a big step in the development of intraparty 
democracy said karl vayno party chief for the republic of 
estonia 
gorbachev has said he favors restrictions on tenure terms for 
party leaders now are unlimited and longevity is a tool officials 
at the local retional and nation levels use to build power and 
privilege 
vayno spoke to reporters during a break in the openingday 
session of the supreme soviet the national parliament that 
formally adopts party policy 
officials announced an agenda focused solely on domestic 
affairs indicating the 1500member body would not consider the 
ussoviet treaty eliminating medium and shorterrange nuclear 
weapons 
a joint meeting monday of the foreign affairs committees of the 
parliaments two chambers approved the treaty the supreme soviets 
presidium has authority to ratify it but there was no indication 
when it would do so 
both gorbachev and president reagan had hoped for ratification 
by the time their moscow summit begins sunday but the us senate 
also has yet to act 
according to vayno a meeting monday of the party central 
committee adopted proposals for consideration at by the june 28 
party conference including a limitation on tenure of party 
officials 
he said other items would exclude certain party jobs from the 
rule among them gorbachevs as national party chief and it was 
uncertain what the conference would decide 
asked for his personal view he said it depends on the 
personality if the vote is about gorbachev i would vote with both 
hands to exclude him 
gorbachev became first secretary in march 1985 and has urged the 
communist party to find ways of renewing its leadership he has 
railed against the 18year reign of leonid i brezhnev as a period 
of corruption and stagnation 
brezhnev held power until his death in 1982 kremlin leaders 
customarily die in office unless they are pushed out in power 
plays like brezhnevs against nikita s khrushchev in 1964 
asked by the washington post last week whether he supported 
limited terms of office gorbachev answered yes but did not 
elaborate 
vayno said the central committee also agreed the conference 
would debate changes in the voting system for positions in the 
soviets or government councils asked whether reforms would 
include multiple candidates he said anything is possible 
he gave no further information about the conference agenda 
which some officials have described as showdown between gorbachevs 
reformers and conservatives in the party leadership 
tatiana zaslavskaya a sociologist and party adviser says 
citizen groups advocating new policies could be organized but 
formation of rival political parties would be unconstitutional 
she told reporters monday she supports the idea of social 
institutions or peoples unions to assist the party 
the supreme soviet and central committee meetings illustrate the 
differences between the soviet and western concepts of democracy 
about 20 people spoke at the central committee meeting then the 
more than 300 committee members adopted the conference agenda 
unanimously vayno said in the supreme soviet as usual all votes 
were unanimous 
gorbachev and other party and government leaders attended the 
parliament session including yegor k ligachev no 2 man in the 
kremlin 
ligachev has been linked with a campaign to slow the reform 
program gorbachev calls perestroika or restructuring he and 
gorbachev spent several minutes in conversation during premier 
nikolai i ryzhkovs address about a law on cooperatives that is to 
be approved wednesday and take effect july 1 
the supreme soviet removed boris n yeltsin a former candidate 
member of the politburo from the presidium yeltsin fell from 
power in november after making a speech in to the central committee 
favoring a more rapid pace of reform than gorbachev his seat went 
to lev n zaikov who also had replaced yeltsin as moscow party 
chief 
ryzhkov said the cooperative movement gorbachev offers as an 
alternative to the inefficient staterun economy is of immense 
social and political significance in a short time it can solve the 
most severe problems of perestroika the demands of the population 
for goods and services 
nearly 6000 coops have been formed in the three months since a 
draft of the law was published compared to 14000 in the previous 
18 months ryzhkov said the increased pace indicates the 
progressive income tax and guarantees that cooperative property 
cannot be seized are viewed favorably

a nut is a nut unless its a hazelnut in 
which case its a filbert and in case you didnt know that an 
industry marketing board is about to spend 200000 to make it all 
perfectly clear 
thats the hazelnut marketing board by the way which works 
handinglove with the oregon filbert commission 
state filbert growers began using the more popular name hazelnut 
in the early 1980s for the round brown nuts of the european hazel 
tree 
the nuts whatever you call them are more popular overseas than 
they are here but oregon growers want to change all that hence 
their first major hazelnutfilbert marketing program 
oregon produces nearly the entire us crop of hazelnuts 
averaging 20000 tons a year but its a piker in a world of nut 
behemoths like spain and turkey which help produce halfamillion 
tons a year 
hazelnuts are probably used worldwide more than any other 
nut says robert gelhar executive secretary for the filbert 
commission we have chocolate bars with almonds in europe theyd 
more likely be hazelnuts 
gelhar said the promotional campaign is aimed at bakeries candy 
makers and other food processing concerns 
its a matter of getting people acquainted with hazelnuts 
gelhar said 
junction city grower jim rear said oregon needs to increase its 
production to 200000 tons annually to compete 
the programs 200000 will come from an increase in packer 
assessments and not everyone is happy about it some say that the 
program was adopted at the wrong time because demand already 
exceeds supply 
its hard to sell more nuts if you dont have them said

orders to the nations factories for big 
ticket durable goods increased for the third consecutive month in 
april the government said tuesday in another report indicating 
strong demand for us exports 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years rose 08 percent last month 
to a seasonally adjusted 1163 billion the climb followed gains 
of 09 percent in march and 01 percent in february 
orders in april were 85 percent greater than a year earlier 
its a moderate increase it clearly shows that export orders 
are very strong said lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa 
group a philadelphiaarea forecasting firm 
the commerce department last week reported that us exports 
surged 23 percent in march to a record 29 billion with much of 
the strength coming in machinery aircraft and computers 
the declining value of the dollar which is less than half of 
what it was three years ago when measured against the japanese yen 
is bolstering sales of us goods overseas by making them cheaper 
when compared to foreign goods 
chimerine and david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer in new york said the cheaper 
dollar also is helping us manufacturers in another way by 
boosting the cost of imported goods in the united states 
there are some hints that consumers are beginning to turn away 
from higher priced imports in favor of domestic goods jones said 
with the signs of economic strength comes concern that 
production in industries is approaching capacity limits a 
development that could fuel price increases 
the fear would be that this continuing strength could be a 
source of renewed inflationary pressure jones said 
however chimerine said i think the fears of an inflationary 
boom have been exaggerated right from the start even with an 
upturn in exports were not in the midst of an economic boom 
much of the strength in april came in electrical machinery 
where orders took a sharp 44 percent jump following a 37 percent 
decline in march orders for military communications equipment more 
than offset drops in orders for other kinds of electrical machinery 
orders in the volatile defense goods category rose 14 percent 
following a big 151 percent increase in march orders excluding 
defense goods rose 08 percent to 1063 billion 
there was also strength in primary metals such as steel orders 
rose 02 percent following a 55 percent increase in march 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a good 
sign of business expansion plans rose 14 percent last month 
following a 39 percent decline at 329 billion orders were 151 
percent ahead of last year 
orders for civilian aircraft particularly to boeing corp 
increased but that was more than offset by a decline in orders for 
military planes leading to an overall 03 percent decline in the 
transportation category following a 28 percent increase a month 
earlier 
there was also a decrease in orders for nonelectrical 
machinery they fell 13 percent following a 25 percent increase 
in march 
shipments of durable goods fell 11 percent in april to 1126 
billion following a 30 percent increase in march the backlog of 
unfilled orders rose from 4004 billion to 4041 billion a 09 
increase

almost 100 vietnamese fishermen in boston harbor 
all former boat people say they face the loss of their livelihood 
this week because of new restrictions on their gillnet fishing 
methods 
but the lobstermen who lobbied the state to enact the new rules 
say that it was their livelihood that was threatened by the fishing 
method used by the vietnamese 
the dispute has led to tension between the two sides including 
one incident in which a lobsterman brandished gun at a vietnamese 
fisherman the vietnamese said 
at issue are restrictions that went into effect this week on the 
use in boston harbor of gill nets which are set upright in the 
water to catch fish by entangling their gills in their meshes 
lobstermen said too many lobsters were being caught up in the nets 
alex farent head of the boston lobstermans association said 
that if in any way this new regulation is not complied with we 
will kiss our livelihoods goodbye thats it 
but to the vietnamese fishermen who began fishing in the area 
last fall losing their right to do so comes as an especially cruel 
blow most of them grew up around boats in vietnam and fishing is 
their only real skill said mai t thoi one of the few of the 
fishermen who speaks english 
the state government didnt consider our need to make a 
living said thoi if this regulation continues theres no way 
we can continue our way of life we are now in an emergency 
situation we need a miracle 
thoi and representatives of the lobstermen met with state 
officials monday and thoi was unable to persuade state officials 
to relent 
james fair assistant director of the division of marine 
fisheries said gillnet fishing within boston harbor is allowed 
during the winter but lobsters often get tangled up in the gill 
nets during the summer catch 
the new regulations were initiated because a valuable resource 
lobsters is in great danger he said fair also said that the 
vietnamese who are not licensed to catch lobsters have sometimes 
retrieved them in their nets 
before the rules went into effect the vietnamese fished within 
three miles of the harbor now they must take their boats out about 
10 miles into deep water which they say is too dangerous with 
their aging vessels 
fair also said the state wanted to stop the conflict between the 
vietnamese and the lobstermen before the tension escalated 
three weeks ago thoi said several vietnamese fishermen 
reported being harassed and threatened by local lobstermen 
tung phan 21 a crew member on one of the boats said monday 
that a lobsterman had pulled his boat near phans boat one day and 
showed a knife yelling at the crew members to get out during 
another incident a lobsterman pulled a gun out and brandished it 
from his boat phan said 
its ironic said thoi we had to flee here and we were 
trying to survive and now theyre not letting us survive 
fair said that state officials recognize that they were able 
to fish like that in vietnam but they have to realize that the 
same techniques are not compatible with the way they do things in 
boston harbor 
thoi said the fishermen hope to continue their fight to be 
allowed to fish in the harbor he said however that we will 
respect the law

pat robertson supporters said tuesday they 
would boycott next weeks republican convention in north carolina 
claiming that party regulars are plotting to deny them influence at 
the national convention 
by not participating in a process designed to abuse our 
delegates we believe we are today making a positive protest that 
we hope will help deter similar behavior in the future said sue 
wyatt the state chairman of robertsons organization 
ms wyatt accused state gop chairman jack hawke of stacking key 
committees and levying a fee of up to 150 for convention delegates 
in an alleged effort to deter robertson supporters from attending 
the robertson leaderships decision apparently will spare the 
gop the bloody fight many had feared at the june 34 state 
convention 
but it may signify a reopening of wounds from the partys 
clashes of the 1970s between its traditional and new right wings 
spelling trouble for gov jim martin and other republican 
candidates who need gop unity in a state where democrats outnumber 
them by more than 2to1 
the spat pits robertson supporters many of whom are new to 
party politics against oldline republicans who generally 
supported vice president george bush or sen bob dole in the 
presidential race robertson suspended his campaign last week 
at issue is the interpretation of party rules governing the 
election of delegates to the state and national gop conventions 
although robertson got less than 10 percent of the vote in the 
march 8 presidential primary his supporters packed many precinct 
and county conventions often comprising a majority 
they hoped that a sizable number of robertson supporters would 
be elected as delegates to the republican national convention in 
august where they could influence the writing of the party 
platform and other matters 
bush supporters say state law gives their candidate a right to 
his choice of at least 29 of north carolinas 54 national gop 
convention delegates based on his victory in the primary they say 
dole who finished second won the other 25 delegates who would be 
uncommitted because he quit the race 
the disagreement led to feuds walkouts and challenges at 
district conventions including a fistfight at the district 
gathering in louisburg

those favoring his removal

gorbachevs reforms and said the changes had virtually no effect on 
life in moscow 
he now is first deputy chairman of the state construction 
committee and said to be in charge of meeting the government goal 
of providing adequate housing for all citizens by the end of the 
century 
since supreme soviet deputies are chosen on oneparty ballots 
yeltsin probably will remain a member until the next election in

house republicans expressing concern but 
not panic over polls showing vice president george bush trailing 
michael dukakis applauded bush tuesday for differing with 
president reagan on panamas manuel antonio noriega 
its a very symbolic circumstance where bush has moved from 
being vice president to being his own candidate said rep jim 
leach of iowa one of the group attending a 90minute closed 
meeting with top bush campaign officials 
almost to a person they were pleased about the separation on 
noriega rep lynn martin of illinois said of her house gop 
colleagues 
bush indicated through aides last weekend that he differed with 
the reagan administration policy of negotiating with gen noriega 
in an effort to get him to relinquish power in panama 
part of the deal reportedly being offered by the administration 
is to drop drug charges against noriega if he agrees to leave 
panama temporarily 
as for the recent polls showing bush trailing massachusetts gov 
dukakis by margins ranging from 7 to 16 percentage points martin 
said we have bad polls if this were october wed be suicidal 
but its may 
she added there wasnt anybody up screaming my god weve 
got the titanic the seas are rough 
meeting with the house members were lee atwater the bush 
campaign manager craig fuller the vice presidents chief of 
staff and pollster robert teeter 
they have him behind teeter said of the polls 
he said he told the house members that were in a very 
artificial period that period when dukakis has been rolling along 
what you got to do is get past this california primary before 
people begin to focus on it the presidential race 
california is one of four states holding primaries on june 7 
the last big day of the primary season 
three recent national polls have jolted bush partisans a gallup 
poll in midmay had dukakis leading nationwide 54 percent to 38 
percent a cbsnew york times poll earlier in the month had dukakis 
ahead 49 to 39 while a harris poll the same period had the margin 
at 50 to 43 
rep jim kolbe of arizona said there was concern but not 
panic among the house republicans 
asked if there was concern about the impact of the bush ticket 
on house races kolbe replied i dont think anybody is feeling 
bush is going to be a negative 
leach predicted there would be other areas beside panama where 
bush would express his differences with administration policy 
the public will see a modest differentiation on isues between 
bush and the president said the iowa congressman a growing 
difference on the style of leadership with the vice president 
making it clear that he will be an involved handson leader 
right now the american people have no particular impression of 
either bush or dukakis said martin 
she and leach said dukakis has benefited from his continuing 
contest with jesse jackson for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
hes been allowed to be defined as a moderate said martin 
because of the contrast with jacksons views on issues

an inmate who bit two guards after testing 
positive for exposure to the aids virus was properly convicted of 
assault with a deadly weapon because human bites are inherently 
dangerous a federal appeals court ruled tuesday 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
affirmed a minneapolis federal court ruling that the mouth and 
teeth of james vernell moore were dangerous weapons he was 
convicted in the january 1987 attack on two guards while he was in 
federal custody 
we hold that the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain a 
finding that moores mouth and teeth were a deadly and dangerous 
weapon because that evidence supported a finding that moore used 
his teeth in a manner likely to inflict serious bodily harm even 
if he had not been infected with the hiv aids virus the 
appeals court said 
moores lawyer had argued that he should be convicted only of 
simple assault not assault with a deadly and dangerous weapon 
but in upholding the conviction on the more serious charge the 
court cited medical testimony that human bites even by persons not 
exposed to aids can inflict serious injury and transmit serious 
diseases 
moore 45 of new york city was a heroin addict who had tested 
positive for the aids virus but did not have aids 
he was convicted of biting guards timothy voight and ronald 
mccullough in january 1987 after they tried to take him out of an 
office at the federal medical center in rochester minn 
only one bite broke through skin and that was on voights leg 
voight said last month that tests show he does not have aids 
defense attorney kevin lund had argued that moore was convicted 
of the charge because of the aids issue the entire focus of this 
case was aidsrelated lund had told the appeals court panel in a 
hearing last month 
lund said the government did not present enough proof that the 
human mouth and teeth under any circumstances are a deadly and 
dangerous weapon 
but assistant us attorney jon hopeman who prosecuted moore 
argued that assault not aids was the issue in the case 
during the trial hopeman said that moore had told a nurse after 
the biting incident that he wanted the guards to die and hoped they 
would get aids from their wounds 
a physician testified at moores trial that there is no direct 
proof that aids can be transmitted from a bite lund had argued 
that lack of such proof meant moore should have been convicted only 
of simple assault 
us district judge diana murphy sentenced moore to five years 
in prison and made the sentence consecutive to an earlier 
conviction at the time of the biting incident moore was serving a 
sevenyear sentence running to 1991 for credit card fraud hes now 
at the federal penitentiary in marion ill 
simple assault carries a maximum threeyear sentence

his mother at heart and i would rather not make him look like the 
big bad wolf 
bonos mother quit her hostess and public relations jobs the day 
her husband tony rose quit as acting general manager of the 
popular desert restaurant named bonos 
i was insulted by the new manager rose said

the natural protein interferon combined with 
standard chemotherapy drugs shows promise in controlling multiple 
myeloma a lethal form of bone cancer researchers said tuesday 
we finally have a leg up on arresting the natural progression 
of the disease and producing patients who are alive at five years 
which has been a rarity said dr martin m oken of the 
university of minnesota 
his research is part of a new effort by scientists to find a 
role for interferon by combining it with the drugs that have long 
been used to attack cancer 
oken said interferon might provide a knockout punch after cancer 
has been weakened but not destroyed by medicines 
the work may also represent a revival of the fortunes of 
interferon which has been on a roller coaster of public acclaim 
and disdain for a decade 
interferon is a natural hormonelike substance that among 
other things helps regulate the bodys immune system when the 
human gene that makes this chemical was isolated some experts 
predicted many uses for interferon in eliminating cancer and 
infections 
however studies showed that when used alone interferon had 
little major impact on any cancer except an exceedingly rare 
malignancy called hairy cell leukemia for which it has become 
standard therapy 
in the latest research presented at the annual meeting of the 
american association of clinical oncology doctors found that 
interferon plus chemotherapy produced complete remissions in 30 
percent of the 54 patients studied 
such remissions in which all signs of the disease are gone are 
rare in multiple myeloma and they are the first step toward curing 
the disease 
in all 41 percent of the patients had remissions that were 
complete or nearly complete in an earlier study only 11 percent 
of the patients reached this level after receiving chemotherapy 
alone 
in another study presented at the meeting doctors from the 
university of north carolina showed promising early results of 
testing interferon against chronic myelogenous leukemia 
these are interesting results said dr james griffin of the 
danafarber cancer institute in boston response rates can be 
improved and toxicity minimized by these recombinant proteins 
about 11000 new cases of multiple myeloma and 5000 cases of 
chronic myelogenous leukemia are found each year 
this form of leukemia can be effectively treated with bone 
marrow transplants however many victims do not receive 
transplants because no suitable narrow donors are available 
dr howard ozer and his colleagues at the university of north 
carolina found they could reduce the outward signs of myelogenous 
leukemia and help the body replace defective cells with normal ones 
for the first time there is a drug available that potentially 
keeps the abnormal cell clone under control and allows the normal 
clone to come back ozer said 
his team tested interferon on 112 people with this form of 
cancer they found that 70 percent of them improved although it is 
still too soon to know how the treatment affects longterm survival 
he said that interferon may have to be given for several years 
to keep the disease under control 
oken said more study will be needed as well to see how 
interferon affects multiple myeloma over time however he added 
i think its a real advance 
typically about 30 percent of multiple myeloma patients survive 
for five years 
just how interferon works against cancer is unclear ozer 
speculates that it acts as a sort of negative growth regulator 
shutting down bone marrow cells that produce cancerous blood cells 
interferon is produced by inserting a human gene into bacteria 
or yeast which can churn out the substance in limitless 
quantities it is just one of several otherwise rare natural 
chemicals to be made through genetic engineering

sailors searching a swamp near the 
airport in the seaside city of cartagena on tuesday captured a 
hijacker who commandeered a jet across the americas and demanded 
100000 and an audience with mother teresa 
the navy said gonzalo carreno nieto was found hiding in mangrove 
roots about 300 yards from a cartagena airport runway still 
clutching the toy grenade he had used to hijack an avianca airlines 
boeing 727 on monday morning while on a domestic flight from the 
drug capital of medellin to bogota 
the hijack began shortly after 9 am when carreno diverted the 
plane back to medellin where he freed all 128 passengers and three 
flight attendants he then ordered the cockpit crew into the sky on 
a trip that took the aircraft to panama where it was refueled 
then to the island of aruba off venezuela and back to colombia when 
the pilot persuaded him they couldnt make it to cuba 
he demanded 100000 said he was terminally ill with cancer and 
wanted to die a big spender and at one point asked to be flown to 
india to meet with mother teresa the nobel prizewinning roman 
catholic nun known for her humanitarian work 
the 45yearold convicted kidnapper described as mentally 
deranged slipped away from the jet as it taxied on a runway after 
it landed at cartagena on monday night after the 11hour hijack a 
navy communique issued in bogota said he was captured in a nearby 
swamp tuesday morning by sailors and marines 
carreno had used a toy gun to kidnap an uncle four years ago 
the navy said 
before that carreno spent nine years in prison awaiting trial 
on a murder charge and he apparently became mentally deranged 
while incarcerated according to his attorney guillermo garcia 
colombian justice frequently is slow unless the accused have 
enough money to pay their way out of prison as several big cocaine 
smugglers have done in recent years 
carreno eventually was found innocent of the murder charge but 
after he got out of prison he turned to crime and became a cocaine 
addict garcia said in a broadcast interview with the colombian 
radio network caracol 
the avianca crew told carreno that the jet didnt have enough 
fuel to make it to cuba and that it would be better to try to land 
in cartagena the hijacker agreed 
without warning the cartagena tower the pilot landed the plane 
at 810 pm edt apparently surprising police and avianca 
employees 
as the plane taxied in the darkness toward the terminal the 
hijacker lowered the stairway out of the rear of the plane jumped 
off and disappeared into the darkness 
the navy sent marines and sailors to search the area around the 
airport and he was found at first light tuesday the navy said 
carreno was wet and hungry and that his clothes were torn from 
running through the swamp 
carreno began babbling that he had a heart condition so he was 
examined at the cartagena naval hospital to see if his health 
claims were true the navy said

the kremlin probably wont meet the 
goal of pulling onefourth of its soldiers out of afghanistan this 
month because guerrillas are overwhelming afghan troops left 
behind diplomats said tuesday 
western diplomats based in islamabad said moslem insurgents have 
harassed departing red army convoys and overrun a string of bases 
defended only by afghan soldiers most of the bases are on the 
eastern border with pakistan 
the regime has lost 18 district towns since midmarch an 
unprecedented string of losses with tactical implications 
strengthening the belief that the afghan army cannot fight the 
guerrillas alone one diplomat said 
soviet forces began their withdrawal may 15 under terms of an 
agreement signed april 14 in geneva and lt gen boris gromov had 
said 25 percent of the 115000 soldiers would be out by the end of 
may 
the sources quoted dispatches from their embassies in kabul 
capital of afghanistan as reporting only one soviet combat unit on 
the move in the past week a 165vehicle column consisting largely 
of armor and artillery 
they had no figures on the number of soldiers who had crossed 
the northern border into soviet territory 
it is difficult to see how the 25 percent withdrawal this 
month promised by gromov will be achieved a diplomat said 
he said there were guerrilla attacks on the first soviet unit to 
leave the country 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in 1978 
and soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 
the guerrillas receive military aid from the united states china 
and other countries through pakistan where more than 3 million 
afghan refugees live in border camps and cities 
afghanistan pakistan the soviet union and united states signed 
the geneva agreement which was mediated by the united nations 
the guerrillas were not invited to the negotiations and said 
they would ignore the result but wellknown commander ahmad shah 
masood is said to have agreed not to fire on the soviets if they 
withdraw peacefully he controls a large portion of the mountains 
and valleys north of kabul 
masood who leads the jamiatiislami group has made deals 
before and always exacts a price diplomats said they did not know 
what it was this time 
senior pakistani diplomats said tuesday their government will 
push during followup talks in geneva this week for speedy 
formation of a transitional government in kabul and faster soviet 
withdrawal 
its time that something substantive is done to put together a 
broadbased government to prevent bloodsheed said a 
foreign ministry official whose name was withheld in keeping with 
government rules 
reports from the western diplomats indicate fighting in the past 
week was concentrated north and west of kabul along the soviet 
withdrawal route and in the eastern provinces near pakistan 
afghan forces also have evacuated some eastern military outposts 
but others have fallen to guerrilla attack 
no figures on prisoners have been released by the insurgent 
alliances headquarters in peshawar pakistan but both guerrillas 
and diplomats say the number of afghan soldiers defecting or 
surrendering since the soviet pullout began could be in the 
thousands 
photographs taken at some captured army posts show large amounts 
of weapons supplies and abandoned vehicles 
control of the east also opens new supply routes for the 
guerrillas who are slowly pushing toward kabul the border camps 
just inside pakistan serve as bases and supply points for the 
insurgents

a taca international airlines jetliner 
reportedly carrying 45 people lost power in both engines as it 
approached new orleans on tuesday and made an emergency landing on 
grass six miles away an official said 
there were no reports of injuries said a controller at new 
orleans international airport 
a controller said the pilot who was apparently coming in from 
latin america radioed he lost power in both engines of the boeing 
737 
it was clean landing said kathy fernandez an employee at 
the us department of agriculture offices who said she saw the 
landing as she went outside to her car 
it came down nice just fine as soon as it landed the door 
opened the chute came down and the people came out and ran away 
from the plane 
as soon as they got out they just ran up the levee up the 
back it started raining about five minutes after that it really 
started to pour 
the controller who would not give his name said the plane went 
down shortly after noon about six miles east of the airport at

the federal government should move all hotels 
and other concessions out of the national parks an environmental 
group said tuesday in releasing a report on what it considers the 
10 most threatened parks 
george frampton president of the wilderness society also urged 
the government to end subsidies for activities of other federal 
agencies that could hurt the parks 
motels and hotels and that kind of thing should go outside the 
national parks frampton said at a news conference jails and 
concession stands dont belong in a sound master plan 
in its section on yosemite national park in california the 
report noted that plans call for a beauty parlor and a jail 
framptons remarks were the latest in more than 60 years of 
controversy over what the national parks should contain there have 
been hotels in the parks since the earliest days of the national 
park service which was founded in 1916 and calls for their 
removal almost as long 
denis galvin deputy director of the service said the agency 
did not want to add any hotels in parks but he said it believed 
the level of development in the traditional parks is appropriate 
and provides an opportunity for a park experience thats rapidly 
becoming unique and just as valid as the backpacking 
experience we aim to provide both 
the societys report was timed to coincide with the beginning of 
the summer vacation season that could bring record visitor loads to 
many parks and to precede the first meeting in 12 years of all 
park superintendents scheduled for next month at a lodge near 
yellowstone national park in wyoming 
the wilderness society and other advocacy groups have stepped up 
campaigns in recent years for protective measures to be taken 
outside park boundaries these lands should have been in the 
parks in the first place frampton said 
we are losing 200 million to 300 million every year selling 
our trees frequently from forest service lands near national 
parks frampton said much of this logging destroys habitat for 
wildlife that roams freely across park boundaries opponents say 
the transfer of 100 million from this activity would make an 
enormous difference without costing the taxpayer a cent frampton 
said 
more than 100 million is needed frampton said he noted that 
the wilderness society is part of a lobbying coalition that seeks 
enactment of a trust fund for federal state and local park and 
recreation land that would eventually yield 1 billion a year 
galvin said the service believes logging is acceptable with 
proper safeguards such as preservation of critical wildlife habitat 
here is the societys list of the 10 most threatened 
installations listed alphabetically because no ranking was given 
and the major threats in the groups view all are national parks 
except the manassas battlefield a national battlefield park and 
the santa monica mountains a national recreation area 
everglades fla changes in water quality and quantity because 
of agricultural and uran development also planned lowaltitude 
fights by the air force

to be reduced by forthcoming regulations as well as mining nearby

park visitors but i dont know that wed pick the same 10 parks 
i dont know what purpose such a list serves except publicity

whats cooking at the national restaurant 
association convention the debate du jour is whether to tip or not 
to tip 
some restaurateurs are calling for a switch to a flat service 
charge as is common in europe but many find the idea unappetizing 
a federal tax law that went into effect jan 1 requires 
restaurants to pay taxes on waiters tips and if waiters fudge on 
the amount of tips they get the internal revenue service can hold 
restaurants liable for taxes on the unreported gratuities 
proponents of a service charge say that among other things it 
would make taxrelated paperwork easier and would make cheating 
harder 
lets face it there are hundreds of thousands of waiters 
earning 40000 and declaring 10000 said susan wine who helps 
run the expensive quilted giraffe which replaced tips with a 
service charge three years ago 
the law never brought the owner in before mrs wine said 
tuesday from new york it never made him a coconspirator it 
always said what he doesnt know wont hurt him 
thats changed and now the big places will have to face up to 
millions of dollars in tax liability 
but if customers dont like a required service charge 
i just say then dont come to my restaurant said michael 
mccarty of santa monica calif owner of an chain of restaurants 
in colorado and california that tacks on a 15 percent charge 
mccarty took part in a lively discussion of tipping monday held 
during the the 69th annual convention of the national restaurant 
association this week 
but arnie morton owner of arnies a popular dining spot for 
celebrities on chicagos gold coast said he once helped run a 
playboy club that had a service charge and it was a huge 
mistake 
you lose motivation attention morton said i think the 
service is going to slip if a waiter knows hes got an automatic 15 
percent tip 
on chicagos south side two women in favor of leaving tips up 
to the customer helped form a group called waitresses against 
involuntary tipping or wait 
eileen wheatley and linda siekman say owners of expensive 
restaurants dont understand the needs of workers at more modest 
eateries and if the owners want to eliminate tips they should 
provide other benefits the women say 
waiter luis cruz filling a drink order tuesday at palmers 
steak house in the downtown loop said he might come out ahead with 
a service charge 
most of our tips come on credit cards so the restaurant knows 
what were taking in anyway said cruz 26 but in a way 
perhaps its better if a service charge is 15 percent thats more 
than i get from some 
jim peterson president of the restaurant association says the 
issue is mostly a concern at expensive restaurants where a juicy 
steak fine wine and rich dessert can add up to a hefty bill and 
a handsome tip 
while his group has no taken no stance peterson acknowledges 
that many members are frustrated over the new federal law 
its burdensome peterson said restaurateurs have been 
put in the position of being a tax collector getting information 
from waiters and reporting it to the government 
this issue has been on the top burner during our meeting 
here he said what most restaurant owners want to be conscious 
of is what the customer finds acceptable in the end that would be 
the most important thing 
joan lang executive editor of restaurant business hopes to 
publish results of a straw poll of restaurateurs in july 
its pretty controversial she said there are some people 
who are very opposed to it and some who think its time has come 
the gut feeling is its pretty evenly divided

the first soviets to visit a chemical 
warfare plant in western europe watched tuesday as british troops 
ripped off their helmets donned gas masks and injected themselves 
with antidote against a simulated nerve gas attack 
armed only with cameras and notebooks the 13 soviet scientists 
and military experts responded by expressing hope that their 
threeday visit would help promote progress on negotiations for a 
global chemical weapons ban 
maj gen robert fedorovich razuvanov commander of the chemical 
warfare facility at shikany in the eastern soviet union modeled a 
british gas mask for dozens of photographers 
the visit is extremely significant and shows that glasnost is 
starting to happen said dr graham pearson director of the 
porton down facility referring to the policy of openness by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
among those watching the 45minute display on the manicured lawn 
outside the chemical warfare defense center at porton down in 
southwest england was yuri nazarkin the chief soviet negotiator at 
the 40nation geneva conference on disarmament 
nine british soldiers carrying sa80 automatic rifles and 
wearing protective camouflage uniforms sprawled on the lawn 
preparing for a simulated battle when an alarm went off in a 
nerveagent detector the soldiers ripped off their helmets and 
pulled gas masks over their faces screaming gas gas gas 
they later injected themselves in the hip through their clothing 
with a simulated antidote used by the british armed forces against 
nerve agent poisoning 
using a portable monitor the soldiers measured the presence of 
nerve agents and mustard gas in the air finally they 
decontaminated a scorpion tank using chemical reagents 
the porton down facility which sprawls across 7000 acres of a 
nature preserve near the ancient stonehenge monument about 80 miles 
southwest of london concentrates on defenses against chemical 
warfare 
were not going to reveal all said pearson we wont show 
them the detailed assessment of what agents we think other 
countries might have but we will be open about the way in which we 
protect the british armed forces against the effects of chemical 
and biological warfare 
britain produced chemical weapons until the 1950s when it 
halted all production and destroyed its stockpile 
pearson said talks between the british and visiting soviet 
experts would cover the fullrange of chemical weapons issues 
including production detection protection monitoring 
decontamination medical countermeasures and disposal 
in july pearson and a dozen british experts will visit shikhany 
some delegates to the geneva conference predicted that 20 years 
of talks would culminate this year in an international agreement 
banning the development production and stockpiling of chemical 
weapons but three months of negotiations ended april 29 with no 
breakthrough in sight 
it is very important for our negotiations in geneva that we 
have more information about what kind of chemical weapons exist 
said tessa solesby the british ambassador to the geneva conference 
one major stumbling block along with verification is the size 
of the soviet chemical weapons stockpile the soviets only 
acknowledged in april 1987 that they had a stockpile of 50000 
tons but western experts estimated it was closer to 300000 tons 
the largest in the world 
although chemical weapons have been used widely in the iraniraq 
war the only country besides the soviet union to acknowledge 
possessing such weapons is the united states which has a stockpile 
estimated at 30000 tons

moscow the nightly news program vremya reported tuesday six of

workers provided by temporary help companies 
are paid about 30 percent below the national average and only 
onefourth get medical benefits enjoyed by virtually all fulltime 
employees the government said tuesday 
in its firstever nationwide survey of the burgeoning temporary 
help industry the labor department found the average wage paid 
last september to temporary workers by firms who hire out their 
services was 642 an hour 
the average hourly wage for all nonsupervisory workers in 
private industry nationwide for the same month was 906 an hour 
according to the bureau of labor statistics 
while still less than 1 percent of the us work force the 
socalled temps who are supervised by client firms but are on 
the payroll of temporary help companies are one of the 
fastestgrowing classes of workers in the country 
in 1987 they grew by 13 per cent to just slightly over 1 
million by the end of the year 
average hourly wages for temporary workers last september ranged 
from less than 4 an hour for construction laborers up to nearly 
25 an hour for engineers but there were considerable differences 
within both occupations and geographic areas 
for example wages for word processors provided by temporary 
services ranged from 609 an hour in indianapolis to 1411 in new 
york city similarly wages for nonconstruction laborers provided 
by such services ranged from an average 373 an hour in denver to 
643 in newark nj 
in a few isolated instances where shortages in certain skills 
has put a premium on the pay that temporary workers can demand the 
government found them being paid more than their fulltime 
coworkers in the same occupation 
temporary word processors in the bergenpassaic nj area were 
paid 958 an hour compared to an average wage of 931 an hour 
paid fulltime employees in the same occupation 
however that was the exception not the rule temporary 
secretaries in bergen and passaic were paid an average 934 an 
hour or 81 percent of the 1059 average paid their fulltime 
counterparts 
the gap was wider elsewhere in baltimore secretaries provided 
by temp services averaged 668 hour or 62 percent of the average 
1059 paid to fulltime secretaries in kansas city temporary 
secretaries averaged 584 an hour or 60 percent of the 980 paid 
their fulltime counterparts 
but it is in the area of benefits which now account for about 
40 percent of some employers labor costs according to the us 
chamber of commerce where the savings become evident in using 
temporary workers 
the governments data showed only 37 percent of temporaries 
hired out by contracting companies get paid holidays and 74 percent 
have paid vacations compared with 99 percent of the permanent 
fulltime workers who enjoy both 
and less than onefourth of the nations temporary workers 
receive any kind of employerprovided hospitalization and medical 
benefits compared with 96 percent of the permanent workers who get 
them the labor department said

a historian has criticized soviet dictator josef 
v stalin for setting the soviet union down a path that led to 
years of confrontation with the west 
vyacheslav dashichev a doctor of historical science wrote in 
the may 18 edition of the newspaper literaturnaya gazeta that the 
problems began mostly after world war ii 
stalin tried to spread his brand of socialism wherever 
possible unified in all countries regardless of their national 
specifics dashichev said 
the article made the point that the reexamination of soviet 
policies under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
greater openness had focused only on problems in domestic affairs 
and not foreign affairs mistakes also were made in foreign 
affairs dashichev said 
soviet foreign policy was at least partly to blame for the arms 
buildup in the west and for the western perception of a soviet 
military threat he wrote 
supercentralism in internal policy unavoidably gave rise to 
hegemony and a feeling of great power in foreign policy the 
article said 
this policy led to soviet splits with yugoslavia china and 
albania according to dashichev 
the historian wrote that stalins view of an expanding socialist 
revolution was largely to blame for provoking us imperialistic 
aggression 
under the late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev 
miscalculations and an incompetent approach brought heightened 
confrontation with the west the article said 
through our political military diplomatic involvement we 
ignored the influence of regional conflicts on detente between the 
ussr and the west and on the entire system of mutual 
relationships dashichev wrote 
brezhnev involved the soviet union in afghanistan he sent in 
troops in december 1979 and only now under gorbachev are they 
withdrawing 
the historian said the main goal in soviet foreign policy should 
be to establish mutual trust with the west especially in nuclear 
disarmament the soviet union should try to get its way on the 
international scene not through force but through economic 
political scientific and cultural successes 
gorbachev has called for new thinking in soviet foreign 
policy to work in what he calls a new system of international 
peace and security gorbachev believes the best way for countries 
to avoid conflict is to put international coexistence above 
national selfinterest

home prices continued to skyrocket in several 
northeastern cities during the first three months of 1988 but the 
hot new york city market cooled somewhat after the october stock 
market crash a real estate trade group said tuesday 
the national association of realtors said the median price of 
existing single family homes in washington dc metro area jumped 
to 132400 a 247 percent increase when compared with the first 
quarter of 1987 
hartford conn with an appreciation of 218 percent to a 
median price of 166400 and providence ri with an increase of 
199 percent to 123300 ranked second and third 
while trouble in the financial markets has affected certain 
pocket areas like the area around new york city the northeast 
region as a whole is still exceptionally vigorous said john a 
tuccillo the associations chief economist 
in new york and its suburbs the median resale price was 
186600 up 102 percent over a year ago but down from the peak of 
190300 in julyseptember 1987 
prices also rose sharply in some west coast cities the 
appreciation rate was 183 percent in los angeles 16 percent in 
orange county calif which includes anaheim and santa ana 112 
percent in san francisco and 103 percent in san diego 
nationally prices rose 41 percent to a median of 88100 
meaning half the houses sold for more and half for less fortyfour 
of the 62 metro areas surveyed posted price increases while 16 
posted declines the information to calculate price changes wasnt 
available for two cities 
most cities suffering price declines were in regions heavily 
dependent on oil or farming oklahoma city posted the largest drop 
95 percent followed by houston 7 percent and denver 69 
percent 
honolulu which was included in the survey for the first time 
supplanted new york as the costliest housing area in the nation 
median prices in honolulu were 198400 
following honolulu was orange county calif 183300 san 
francisco 178800 and boston 176900 
the least costly housing area was louisville ky where the 
median home cost 51100 lansing mich was next at 54400 
followed by des moines iowa 54500 grand rapids mich 
55400 and oklahoma city 56500 
although prices increased in most areas the pace of sales 
slackened from last years record levels in most areas sales 
slackened in 28 states and the district of columbia 
twenty of the states suffered declines of 10 percent or more of 
those nine had drops of more than 20 percent 
although there were more resale decreases than increases many 
of the declines were in comparison to a surge in sales during the 
first quarter of 1987 tuccillo said 
minnesota with a 393 percent decline suffered the biggest 
setback of any state other states with large declines in the pace 
of sales were colorado with a 314 percent drop arkansas down 
252 percent and new hampshire down 248 percent 
by contrast alaska recorded a 771 percent increase in sales 
followed by kentucky with a 286 percent rise vermont with a 
258 percent pickup nevada up 237 percent and west virginia up 
189 percent 
nationally existing homes sold at an annual rate of 366 
million units during the quarter 8 percent lower than a year ago 
despite the decline association officials said sales were still 
strong they noted that sales in early 1987 were propelled by 
relatively low interest rates on fixedrate mortgages which fell 
to nineyear lows of 9 percent to 95 percent on average rates in 
the first quarter of this year were about a percentage point higher 
tuccillo said he expected the national sales pace to decline by 
6 percent for the rest of the year with prices rising between 5 
percent and 6 percent

a 785000 libel judgment won by a former 
county prosecutor has been overturned by the trial judge who said 
that the news stories were expressions of opinion about the 
official protected by the first amendment 
the ruling monday by district judge jack litman cancels the 
damages awarded by a jury to former carlton county attorney donald 
diesen three weeks earlier after a nineday trial in his lawsuit 
against the duluth newstribune 
the judge did what the jury should have done but failed to do 
protected opinion and matters of public concern and interest as 
first amendment rights said thomas thibodeau a lawyer for the 
newspaper 
diesen who had sought 25 million in damages declined comment 
on the ruling but his lawyer patrick tierney said it would be 
appealed 
i didnt expect this tierney said but im not shocked by 
it either its unusual for a judge to overturn a jury verdict 
but in this case we are dealing with a complicated legal issue 
whether you can defame by a false implication from a series of 
accurate statements the judge allowed the jury to decide that 
issue 
in its november 1981 stories on battered women in carlton 
county the newstribune said diesen did not prosecute domestic 
abuse cases aggressively 
diesen said the articles caused him extreme embarrassment and 
humiliation cost him reelection and made it difficult for him to 
earn a living in 1982 he sued the newspaper reporter john 
hessburg and former executive editor thomas daly 
the jury found the articles defamatory and concluded that the 
newspaper acted with malice by recklessly disregarding the whole 
truth 
but litman said the eightperson jury erred in concluding that a 
false impression arising from factually based articles is libelous 
litman agreed with the newstribunes argument that implications 
about diesens performance were opinions of the reporter the 
publisher or the articles sources 
as opinion it is constitutionally protected the judge said 
noting that diesen was an elected public official litman said 
any factual account of his performance as county attorney must be 
considered within the ample province of first amendment 
protections

putting a dummy behind the wheel of a 
parked state patrol car is proving to be a smart idea patrol 
officials say 
the patrols duluth district started putting a mannequin in the 
drivers seat of an old patrol car monday and it will be in use at 
least through the busy memorial day weekend 
were doing it to raise the perception of visible law 
enforcement said patrol capt eric gunderson weve taken one 
of our units thats about to be traded and parked it in an area of 
high volume and high visibility 
the mannequin was borrowed from a clothier and dressed in a 
patrol uniform 
on monday afternoon the car with the mannequin was parked on 
the southbound side of interstate 35 just past the superior street 
exit to duluth about one in every four motorists applied the 
brakes as they approached the car 
the mannequin wont be spending much time in one spot gunderson 
plans to move it around daily to areas of high traffic volume or 
numerous accidents 
so the next time you go past a patrol car it might or might 
not be a dummy gunderson said

in a matter of weeks we should have something said jerry hoppe 
chief icc engineer 
on may 8 fire destroyed virtually all the vital hardware at the

the outage has cost businesses untold amounts of money because 
of limited longdistance and local phone service and localities 
have been forced to spend thousands of dollars to bolster public

the chairman of the senate banking committee 
scolded reagan administration officials tuesday for offering 
pitiful solutions for the stock markets problems and promised 
to press ahead with his own bill 
committee chairman william proxmire dwis used a hearing 
called by his panel to lecture the authors of the white houses 
latest report on last falls market crash 
the progress that you have made is pitiful he said of the 
groups two months of work 
this working group has been the regulatory equivalent of the 
north carolina tar heels basketball strategy called the four 
corners offense proxmire said pass the ball around and run 
out the clock never shoot just stall and run out the clock 
the highranking administration officials who produced the 
report which was released may 16 advanced several mild steps for 
soothing the nations volatile markets and nervous investors 
they included a call for an hourlong trading halt in the 
nations stock futures and options markets if the dow jones 
industrial average plunges by 250 points in a single day such a 
decline has occurred only once last oct 19s 508point drop 
which has triggered on ongoing look at the markets volatility by 
the government and congress 
proxmire introduced legislation march 31 that would establish a 
committee consisting of the chairmen of the federal reserve board 
the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures 
trading commission the committee would oversee issues that affect 
all of the nations markets such as coordinating margins or 
downpayments exchanged in transactions and setting up circuit 
breakers to halt trading during emergencies 
my aim is to make sure that there is an accountable entity 
with both the responsibility and the expertise to make the 
decisions on intermarket issues proxmire said 
currently the cftc oversees the futures markets while the sec 
and the fed share responsibility for the stock and options 
exchanges 
after the hearing proxmire told reporters he expected his 
committee to send the legislation to the full senate next month 
with congress schedule abbreviated this year because of the 
elections and with some lawmakers joining the administration in 
opposing strong legislative action on the problem it seems 
unlikely that any bill will become law in 1988 
it makes it much harder to have the administration opposed 
proxmire conceded the president has the veto and the 
administration has influence with many members of congress 
sentiment on the banking committee toward the need for 
legislation seems split and not along party lines 
while sen alfonse damato rny said wed be darned fools 
to say that all is well with the financial markets sen john 
shelby dala said a lot of us here dont believe you can 
legislate investors confidence 
treasury undersecretary george d gould who headed the working 
group expressed frustration with lawmakers criticisms saying 
as you know i have spent my life in the markets and i would 
like a little credit for some of the insights of 35 years 
also writing the report were fed chairman alan greenspan cftc 
chairwoman wendy gramm and sec chairman david s ruder 
ruder has dissented from his colleagues on several points 
arguing that futures margins should be raised and that the sec 
should oversee futures trading the sec meets thursday to fashion 
legislative proposals that will be submitted to congress by next 
week

the operator of a mailorder pornography 
business filed suit in federal court here tuesday to stop the 
justice department from prosecuting him on obscenity charges in 
four states 
avram freedberg owner of consumers marketing group ltd of 
stamford conn is seeking an injunction to prevent the justice 
departments national obscenity enforcement unit from bringing the 
charges in federal courts in mississippi indiana utah and 
delaware 
the suit charges that the effort to prosecute freedberg his 
wife rhoda and others in the four jurisdictions is merely a 
campaign to harass the firm and drive it out of business by forcing 
it to incur large legal fees 
although shielded by the specious pretext that they are 
enforcing federal obscenity statutes defendants are unlawfully and 
unconstitutionally preventing plaintiffs from enaging in a legal 
occupation said freedbergs motion for a temporary restraining 
order 
defendants simply disapprove of the content of plaintiffs 
promotional materials magazines and videotapes and are 
unconstitutionally intimidating plaintiffs with multiple 
simultaneous or consecutive obscenity prosecutions the suit

the government said tuesday it 
will begin evicting 1800 blacks next month from a settlement 
adjoining the town president pw botha once represented in 
parliament 
civil rights workers say the planned evictions from lawaiicamp 
signify a return to the brutal forced removals of the past 
white officials say the 40yearold black community is an 
illegal unsanitary squatter camp and its actions do not constitute 
a forced removal 
lawaiicamp is on the outskirts of george five miles from a 
scenic stretch of indian ocean coastline east of cape town 
botha was elected to parliament from the george constituency in 
1948 and represented it until he became south africas president in 
1984 
the government wants to move lawaiicamp residents to sandkraal 
which is about a mile further from george and was established four 
years ago to be the areas official black township 
georges mayor john rogers said at a news conference tuesday 
that lawaiicamp residents had until may 31 to move voluntarily the 
town council plans to apply for eviction orders in court on june 1 
and to demolish the 180 remaining lawaiicamp homes once they are 
vacated 
rogers said evicted families would be paid compensation and 
provided with new homes about 800 families have already moved from 
lawaiicamp to sandkraal and the government claims they enjoy 
better services and amenities 
the mayor said violence would not be used against the residents 
resisting eviction but he did not explain how this could be assured 
in the face of possible defiance 
the current parliament member for george hennie smit said the 
matter is being handled in an understanding sympathetic manner 
he said lawaiicamp is illegal because it is on land designated 
for use by people of mixed race a new mixedrace township is to be 
developed on the site 
last week law and order minister adriaan vlok accused 
antiapartheid organizations of encouraging lawaiicamp residents to 
resist removal 
he said anglican archbishop desmond tutu and other activists 
were playing with fire by stirring up emotions which could be 
detrimental to public order 
in early 1986 the government tried to evict lawaiicamp 
residents but backed off because of legal challenges and stiff 
resistance 
this time the government says it will not yield residents of 
lawaiicamp say they are determined to stay where they are 
prominent antiapartheid clergymen are planning to protest the 
government decision this sunday at a prayer service in george 
among those scheduled to attend is the rev allen boesak a south 
african who is president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
from 1950 to 1983 the government forcibly resettled an 
estimated 35 million people nearly all of them black botha said 
in 1984 that there would be no more forced removals but critics 
say the policy continues under different names such as slum 
clearance and squatter control 
botha said last year that he opposed forced removal unless it 
is accompanied by the provision of better living conditions 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

the state department has relented and given 
permission to one of vietnams leading economic policymakers to 
visit the united states rep chester g atkins and the american 
civil liberties union said tuesday 
nguyen xuan oanh a member of vietnams national assembly and an 
advocate of economic liberalization originally was denied entry 
into the united states under a law permitting the state department 
to bar foreigners on grounds of national interest 
oanh 66 a ustrained economist who has held highranking 
positions in both the usbacked administration in south vietnam 
and the communist government that unified vietnam in 1975 applied 
in march to come to the united states to speak at harvard and other 
universities 
the department has sought to limit visits by vietnamese 
particularly those involved in the economy to keep vietnam in 
economic isolation as long as it maintains an estimated 120000 
troops in neighboring cambodia the united states has had no 
diplomatic relations with vietnam since 1975 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the department changed its mind on oanh because recent legal 
rulings prohibit the widespread use of national interest under 
the mccarranwalter immigration act to deny visas 
atkins a massachusetts democrat on the house foreign affairs 
committee said the state departments original indication that 
it would deny him a visa under the misbegotten mccarranwalter act 
was a mistake and i am gratified that the administration has 
changed its mind 
atkins said oanh is an advocate of moving his country out of 
its economic isolation and toward some limited freemarket 
policies 
he and seven other members of congress said in a letter to 
secretary of state george p shultz that despite us 
nonrecognition of the vietnamese government it is possible and 
we believe healthy to understand some of the latest policy 
developments there 
dr oanh is a very sophisticated highly trained academic who 
is likely to take back some very keen insights about the united 
states the legislators said allowing a few tentative steps 
toward an academic exchange can only suggest the possibilities that 
one day would accrue to vietnam once impediments to normalization 
are resolved 
kate martin director of the aclus national security litigation 
project said her group was involved on oanhs behalf with the 
state department legal office 
the united states has hinged improvements in relations with 
vietnam on withdrawal from cambodia and the best possible 
accounting for the estimated 1700 americans still listed as 
missing from the vietnam war 
the next opportunity for a highlevel usvietnamese meeting 
will come in early june when foreign minister nguyen co thach 
comes to new york to attend a united nations disarmament conference 
there were no plans for any us official of equal or nearequal 
rank to meet thach although a session is expected between thach 
and retired gen john w vessey who is president reagans special 
representative on behalf of the missing us servicemen

the environmental protection agency has 
permitted lead concentrations in fresh florida grapefruit juice 20 
times what it permits in drinking water according to an advocacy 
group critical of the agencys pesticide decisions 
the lead arises from the use of lead arsenate to accelerate the 
ripening of grapefruit so farmers can ship them to market in 
september and october normally florida grapefruit would not be 
available until november 
the last federal license to sell lead arsenate was surrendered 
earlier this year by the manufacturer microflo co of lakeland 
fla rather than conduct more tests that epa said were needed for 
its 10yearold review of arsenicbased pesticides 
in return for surrendering the license the company was 
permitted to sell remaining inventories up to 100000 pounds per 
year have been used recently enabling growers to earn almost 10 
million a year in extra profits by sending fruit to market early 
according to epa estimates 
the national coalition against the misuse of pesticides said it 
believed there was enough lead arsenate in florida distribution 
channels to serve growers for another two years 
it is irresponsible for epa to stand by and allow the 
application of this material jay be treated 
firmly so that he cannot involve nonusers and so that his own 
drug use ceases 
the cry for legalization comes not because americans want to 
accept the costs of drug use but because some are afraid we 
cannot win this fight and that the cost of maintaining the war 
against drugs has become too great bennett said in too many 
places we now have what amounts to de facto legalization of drugs 
if we now legalize drugs we should not deceive ourselves that 
education and treatment programs will then be sufficient 
effectively to minimize drug use and its consequences bennett 
said that simply wont work 
legalizing drugs would be so stark a moral surrender in the 
war on drugs that it would tear the essential foundation out from 
under drug education programs they would not be effective and we 
cannot expect treatment programs to repair the damage

state officials began efforts tuesday to 
take control of the troubled jersey city schools citing rampant 
political patronage mismanaged schools and a chronic failure to 
educate the districts 32000 students 
it is believed it would be the first time a state has taken over 
such a large urban district 
education commissioner saul cooperman said his decision to seek 
control of the district new jerseys secondlargest is based on 
results of separate yearlong investigations by independent 
auditors and state officials 
political patronage union pressure and cronyism is a 
consistent motivation at all levels in the hiring firing and 
promoting of staff cooperman said in his formal notice of 
takeover plans 
the auditors report cites a state of managerial bankruptcy 
in the district and a disorganized and dysfunctional 
administration both reports were highly critical of the school 
district from the local board of education and top level 
administrators to school principals 
assistant education commissioner walter mccarroll said the 
probes revealed an overwhelming failure by the district to 
provide an education to its largely poor innercity student 
population 
cooperman concluded that district administrators were incapable 
of properly running the schools or fixing widespread problems 
if coopermans seizure of the district is successful it would 
mark the first such takeover of such a large urban district 
according to the national governors association the 
washingtonbased group has been monitoring the growing movement by 
states to obtain more power to take control of districts deemed 
failures at educating children 
under new jersey legislation enacted five months ago cooperman 
could abolish the local board of education fire the superintendent 
and top administrators and appoint a state superintendent to 
operate the schools for at least five years the law gives new 
jersey officials some of the broadest powers in the nation to take 
control of deficient districts 
the auditors also found inadequate record keeping missing 
contract documents questionable payroll and personnel practices 
and unsecured contract procedures they also said the district has 
wasted more than 12 million on an improper health insurance plan 
richard kaplan who ran the state investigation said employees 
are routinely rewarded or demoted based upon which mayoral 
candidates they back in the democratic stronghold 
principals are not in control of their buildings and students 
and teachers are often not found where they are assigned and not 
focused on instructional purposes said the auditors report 
teachers werent optimistic that state control would spell an 
end to the districts problems 
mike bogart a grammar school teacher at public school 24 said 
that over time rules have been forgotten and replaced with double 
standards 
we cant come back but i guess weve got to try bogart 
said 
the investigators findings have been referred to the state 
division of criminal justice to determine if there have been any 
criminal actions 
cooperman went to court monday for an emergency order giving him 
veto power over personnel and fiscal matters in the district 
mccarroll said the action was taken to maintain the status quo 
as the takeover dispute is resolved a hearing on the states 
request for veto power is scheduled for june 7 
coopermans action signed monday gives the district 10 days to 
accept the decision or reply 
if local officials fight the matter will go before an 
administrative law judge cooperman must then decide whether to ask 
the state board of education to issue an order taking over the 
district 
superintendent franklin williams has said that if the district 
was properly funded the state would not need to take it over 
he also has said conditions are not as bad as the state 
maintains many problems he said stem from a high crime rate 
drug problems and poverty among students many of whom are homeless 
or do not speak english 
but cooperman disagreed the facts are stubborn things i 
would respectfully disagree with the superintendent 
mayor anthony cucci said he welcomed the state intervention but 
said he wants to know who will pay any additional costs 
a constant source of concern is finance cucci said adding 
that school conditions had improved since he took office in july 
1985 you cant leave the financial things aside i refuse to 
surrender that point 
leslie silberman a spokeswoman for the jersey city board of 
education said the panel would not comment on coopermans 
recommendation until they had time to read the report

federally mediated hearings opened tuesday to 
settle a bitter dispute between airline unions and texas air corp 
over whether the companys two subsidiaries continental and 
eastern airlines should be considered a single airline for 
bargaining purposes 
the issue is important for the unions because neither pilots nor 
mechanics at continental airlines are unionized while both groups 
have militant union organizations at eastern airlines 
texas air corp contends that while it owns both eastern and 
continental the subsidiaries remain independent air carriers and 
should have separate dealings with labor 
the first day of hearings before roland watkins a hearing 
officer for the national mediation board began as about 120 
continental pilots staged a protest across the street from the 
boards headquarters because they have not been allowed to 
participate in the proceedings 
we dont want to be railroaded by this complained rick 
swanson who has been a continental pilot for six years and is a 
leader in a continental employee group called continental by 
choice 
a spokesman for the group carter smith said a total of about 
400 pilots flight attendants reservation clerks mechanics and 
other continental employees also participated in the various 
demonstrations 
the pilots later marched to the headquarters of the air line 
pilots association where they also set up protest pickets alpa 
which represents 40000 commercial pilots has led the fight to get 
the continental and eastern work force under a single bargaining 
system 
in tuesdays testimony the pilots union argued that texas air 
asserts centralized control over both airlines and exercises 
close control over the management of both eastern and continental 
particularly with respect to labor relations 
it cited as examples in support of its argument texas airs 
recent arrangement to provide 225 million to eastern in event of 
a strike the union also noted other joint agreements between the 
two airlines in the transferring of assets the sharing of sales 
forces and integration of its frequent flyer programs 
joseph manson an attorney for texas air corp sought 
unsuccessfully at the beginning of the hearing to have the 
proceedings stopped arguing that the board had no jurisdiction 
over the matter 
the unions have one and only one purpose and that is to 
destroy eastern instead of addressing the real problems at 
eastern manson said he called the petition by alpa and other 
unions representing flight attendants and mechanics at eastern 
another media event 
its not known how long the proceedings before watkins will 
take but the threemember board has reserved time into late june 
for a series of hearings the board is not likely to consider the 
case until mid or late summer

the city council has approved a bill that 
protects homosexuals from discrimination ending a struggle that 
lasted eight years 
mayor kurt schmoke who supported the measure has said he would 
sign the bill when it reaches his desk 
the bill was opposed by roman catholic bishop william borders 
similar bills have been enacted in new york atlanta 
philadelphia and washington dc 
for the most part the final debate on the measure lacked the 
intensity and emotion that accompanied the councils earlier 
dealings with the proposal 
the thunderous applause that greeted the 127 vote was an 
indication of the long struggle to adopt an ordinance to outlaw 
discrimination against homosexuals in housing employment 
education health and welfare services 
similar bills were defeated in 1980 and 1985 
i hope this is the last time we have to address human rights 
in this city said councilwoman vera hall 
meanwhile a controversial gay rights bill which is entering 
its 16th year before the massachusetts legislature advanced 
tuesday on the narrowest of committee votes 
the senate ways and means committee endorsed the bill to ban 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a vote of 76 
the bill now goes to the senates steering and policy committee 
which held the bill for 42 days of its 45day maximum limit last 
year 
the legislation passed the house and won a majority in the 
senate last year but then got hung up in a committee

the soviet union has agreed to grant visas to 
israeli diplomats for the first time in 21 years and will issue 
them after next weeks superpower summit in moscow three israeli 
news reports said tuesday 
israel radio and television and the maariv daily said israeli 
and soviet diplomats reached the agreement at a weekend meeting in 
zurich switzerland 
a foreign ministry official reached by telephone said of the 
reports they are not true 
but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
that meetings took place in zurich between nimrod novick a foreign 
ministry political adviser and vladimir terrasov deputy head of 
the soviet foreign ministrys middle east department 
there was progress but its little and slow the official 
said of the meetings he declined to elaborate 
moscow broke diplomatic ties with israel during the 1967 middle 
east war 
according to the reports the soviets agreed to allow five 
israeli diplomats to travel to moscow to handle the issuing of 
visas to soviet jewish emigrants who now are processed through the 
dutch embassy in moscow 
none of the reports gave a date for the visit 
the reports come at a time when kremlin leaders are seeking a 
greater role in the middle east including participation in a 
proposed international conference on the arabisraeli conflict 
israeli leaders are divided over such a conference foreign 
minister shimon peres head of the leftofcenter labor party 
favors it his coalition partner prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
the rightwing likud bloc is opposed 
soviet leaders have improved relations with israel in the last 
two years by holding meetings with israelis abroad and by 
increasing the flow of jewish emigration to the jewish state 
last year israel permitted an eightmember soviet consular 
delegation to visit israel some of these diplomats are still 
conducting consular duties from the finnish embassy in tel aviv 
shamir indirectly referred to the contacts in remarks to 
reporters tuesday 
i think there is no doubt israel has all desire and reasons to 
live in peace and maintain ties with the soviet union shamir 
said we always wanted friendly relations with the soviet union 
a superpower because our jewish brothers live there and we want 
to discuss with the russians their fate

a rise in production expenses and a decline in 
federal payments continue to bear on 1988 farm income prospects an 
agriculture department report said tuesday 
net cash income of farmers is forecast at 50 billion to 55 
billion this year down from the record of 57 billion in 1987 the 
report said that is unchanged from usdas previous forecasts 
the departments economic research service added that underlying 
the forecast are improvements in several of agricultures key 
fundamentals 
use of most of the major commodities has increased thereby 
reducing burdensome stockpiles 
market prices for those commodities are approaching or are 
higher than the governments support levels 
higher cattle prices have offset minor declines in production 
interest rates have continued to be moderate 
total farm debt is declining for the fifth consecutive year 
indicating further gains in the financial position of operators 
production expenses are expected to rise after declining at 
an unprecedented rate the last three years the report said 
spring fertilizer prices were up 10 percent from a year ago and 
those will be felt most by corn and barley producers whose 
outlays for fertilizer make up 38 percent and 30 percent 
respectively of variable costs the report said the corn belt 
will be the region most affected 
energy expenses may rise about 5 percent this year with cash 
grain and cattle and hog operations accounting for more than 60 
percent of fuel costs last year again the corn belt will be most 
affected 
thus the drop in 1988 net cash income the difference between 
gross cash income and cash expenses will be mostly due to higher 
cash expenses outweighing greater cash receipts from the sale of 
crops and livestock 
further the report said direct payments to farmers in 1988 are 
expected to drop by as much as 20 percent from last years 17 
billion

the house on tuesday passed and sent to 
president reagan legislation to restrict the use of a popular 
boathull paint that is effective against marine organisms like 
barnacles but which poses environmental risks 
the bill approved by voice vote would ban the use of paints 
containing organic tin additives on nonaluminum hull vessels less 
than 82 feet long the most widely used additive is tributyltin or 
tbt 
the measure would permit continued use of such paints on large 
vessels and those with aluminum hulls so long as the organic tin 
compounds are not released into the water at more than 4 micrograms 
per square centimeter a day 
paints with organic tin are much more effective against 
barnacles and marine algae than copperbased paints meaning lower 
maintenance costs for boat owners copperbased paints corrode 
aluminum surfaces 
releases into the water from copperbased paints become 
nontoxic almost immediately but organic tin additives can remain 
toxic for up to six months according to the house merchant marine 
and fisheries committee 
sen john chafee rri says that england and france have 
regulated organic tin marine paints because they have damaged 
shellfish beds he says that while their effects on humans are not 
known high levels of tbt have been found in chinook salmon in this 
country

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis denounced 
president reagans veto of a major trade bill tuesday saying it 
was unconscionable to oppose requiring advance notice of plant 
closings 
any administration that is willing to give general manuel 
noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to 
give the american worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out 
on the street dukakis said 
he was referring to the bills advancenotice provision and to 
reports that the administration is considering dropping drug 
charges against the panamanian leader in order to persuade him to 
relinquish power 
the massachusetts governor spent tuesday tending to state duties 
in advance of a wednesday trip to washington where campaign aides 
said he would pick up endorsements from a dozen members of 
congress including five senators and a handful of house members 
from california he will also meet with sen albert gore jr a 
former presidential candidate who still has nearly 400 delegates 
the new round of super delegate endorsements are part of 
dukakis campaign strategy to line up enough delegates prior to the 
june 7 primaries in california new jersey new mexico and montana 
to guarantee a mathematical lock on the nomination if he wins in 
those states 
dukakis aides have said the reagan tradebill veto would give 
him a strong economic issue to use in the expected fall campaign 
against vice president george bush 
massachusetts has a state law that encourages companies to give 
90day advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs it 
includes sanctions against companies that refuse to comply 
in a campaign statement dukakis tied bush to the veto saying 
reagan and bush dont understand that for working families who 
struggle to pay the mortgage save for their childrens education 
and care for their elders there is nothing more painful than 
losing a job 
i think the president is making a very serious mistake this 
is a good trade bill its a responsible bill its been passed by 
the congress with broad bipartisan support to veto this bill 
because it will give working people and their families 60 days 
notice before theyre laid off seems to me to be unconscionable 
he said 
also on tuesday dukakis urged a legislative committee to 
toughen state criminal sentencing guidelines and lengthen the 
mandatory license suspension for motorists convicted of drunken 
driving 
the governor arranged to collect a dozen or more endorsements 
from members of congress on wednesday as he sought to ensure enough 
delegate support to clinch the nomination by the time the primary 
season ends on june 7 
campaign and congressional aides speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the list includes sens quentin burdick of north 
dakota wendell ford of kentucky dale bumpers of arkansas john 
breaux of louisiana and harry reid of nevada several members of 
the california house delegation also are expected to announce their 
support including reps esteban torres fortney h pete stark 
anthony c beilenson tom lantos and leon panetta as are a handful 
of house members from other parts of the country 
officials also said sen george mitchell of maine is expected to 
endorse dukakis on friday perhaps with rep joseph brennan and 
other maine delegates 
also on wednesday dukakis will meet privately with defeated 
rival gore whose press spokesman mike kopp said the meeting was 
scheduled at the request of dukakis 
there are no plans for an endorsement kopp said 
gore has nearly 400 delegates to the democratic national 
convention and he has tried to keep them even though he dropped 
out of the presidential race in april following the new york 
primary more than 30 have defected in the past month according to 
an associated press count 
the latest associated press delegate count has dukakis with 
1668 leaving him 413 short of the 2081 needed for nomination 
dukakis remaining democratic rival jesse jackson has 
complained that dukakis is unfairly padding his delegate lead with 
super delegates party leaders and elected officials who by virtue 
of their positions are delegates to the democratic national 
convention 
but dukakis aides said they planned to step up their efforts to 
get super delegate endorsements to make it certain that dukakis 
locks up the nomination with the final primaries when 466 
delegates will be chosen

rains last month brought temporary relief to 
many parched areas of the west where the outlook for this summers 
water supply had been poor the agriculture department said tuesday 
while drought continues in many areas it certainly is good to 
see an increase in rainfall said wilson scaling chief of the 
departments soil conservation service were hoping this change 
will develop into a longterm pattern 
scaling said precipitation in april was near to above normal in 
most areas west of the rocky mountains the columbia basin got 
abovenormal precipitation and arizona received twice its april 
average 
reservoir storage is very good in the colorado and rio grande 
basins he said we also expect reservoirs in arizona and new 
mexico to fill 
but scaling said the water supply outlook in other areas is not 
nearly so bright 
some areas in montana will be facing water supply shortages as 
early as next month he said there are also sections of 
california nevada oregon idaho and washington that remain very 
dry despite the recent increase in precipitation 
scaling added its going to take a lot more than just one 
good month of precipitation to ease the drought in those areas

a federal appeals court tuesday upheld the 
national highway transportation safety administrations refusal to 
reopen an investigation of alleged safety defects in 19661979 ford 
cars 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
ruled 21 that it did not have the jurisdiction to review nhtsas 
regulation that permitted consideration of nonsafety factors in 
deciding whether to conduct an investigation 
while safety is an indispensable element of the decision not 
to investigate nhtsa can and does consider such nonsafety 
factors as its available resources enforcement priorities the 
likelihood of uncovering sufficient evidence to establish the 
existence of a defect and the prospect of ultimately succeeding in 
any necessary enforcement litigation the court said 
these factors are not reviewable by a court because they are 
within the agencys discretion judges abner mikva and harry 
edwards said in a joint opinion 
the decision reversed an earlier ruling by the same court that 
the center for auto safety could seek judicial review of the 
agencys refusal to reopen the case involving ford transmissions 
that have a tendency to slip into reverse gear 
in one of the last acts of the carter administration the 
transportation department decided against recalling any of the 
allegedly unsafe cars opting instead to order placement of warning 
stickers on the dashboards of the vehicles 
chief judge patricia wald writing in dissent said a review 
of the agencys past published decisions under this regulation 
demonstrates that in fact it has always relied on safety and remedy 
factors not on the resources factors though unsuitable for 
judicial review 
wald noted that the agencys stated reasons for denying the 
centers petition at no point rely on agency resources or 
priorities 
clarence ditlow iii executive director of the consumer activist 
group said there still were 8 million cars with the allegedly 
defective transmissions on the road

the defense department on tuesday dismissed a 
published report that pakistan had test fired a missile capable of 
carrying a nuclear warhead 
i certainly dont have any evidence of that and all the 
people ive talked to report likewise said dan howard the 
pentagons chief spokesman when asked about the report in the new 
york times 
there is no indication evidence or otherwise that the paks 
have done anything like that 
the times reported tuesday it had been told by a pakistani 
source with close ties to the government that a missile was 
launched at a test range in the thar desert on april 25 and that 
it was capable of reaching the indian cities of bombay and new 
delhi 
the newspaper quoted the source as saying the missile was of 
home design but produced with the help of chinese experts it 
said a reagan administration official who asked not to be 
identified confirmed that such a test firing had been conducted 
pakistan is widely reported to have the capability of building 
nuclear weapons or to be close to it such reports have been 
circulating since late april when india announced it had developed 
a longrange missile 
neighboring india exploded an atomic device in 1974 
moslem pakistan and hindu india have fought each other three 
times since they became separate nations in 1947 
howard reiterated the reagan administration view that the 
pakistanis have not produced any nuclear weapons 
a senior pakistani defense ministry official meantime speaking 
in islamabad on condition of anonymity said of the times report 
i have no information whether or not such a missile exists 
the times story appeared as pakistani defense secretary syed 
ijlal zaidi opened consultations with us officials here by 
visiting defense secretary frank c carlucci at the pentagon 
howard said he did not know if the topic of missile experiments 
had surfaced during tuesdays talks which were said to focus on 
us military aid military cooperation between the two countries 
and a review of regional political perspectives

helen geron considers herself resourceful 
as a homeless mother she has to be 
i take care of my children the best way i can said ms 
geron a mother of six and grandmother of two and a participant in 
a twoweek retreat for members of the national union of the 
homeless 
im very resourceful ms geron said i dont let nobody 
walk over me and my kids are that way too 
ms geron traveled to philadelphia from albuquerque nm last 
week she is one of about a dozen homeless mothers here for the 
retreat all members of the homeless union an activist group with 
chapters in 14 states 
during the retreat participants are making plans to for further 
takeovers of abandoned housing a protest tactic that the union has 
used in the past 
ms geron and others attending the retreat said safety net 
programs have not helped them solve their problems 
we dont want to be taken care of ms geron said i am a 
human being and i need to work 
the challenge of caring for children when you can barely care 
for yourself is a taxing one according to several of the mothers 
its a dual responsibility and a dual fight said sonya 
terry 28 who gave birth to a son two months ago while she was 
living in a shelter in detroit 
michael is my only natural child on this earth she said 
and i didnt have a place of my own a home for him i went 
through a period of being very depressed 
the women said they receive afdc stipends but find the money 
inadequate for maintaining a family especially if an eviction 
fire or other mishap leaves them without an apartment or house 
i put the blame for being homeless on myself said leann 
hummel a 32yearold from portland ore whose children are 10 
and 13 she said the emotional effect of being homeless knocked her 
off balance for a time 
now my children have been kidnapped taken from me by their 
father she added i dont know when i will ever see them 
again 
barbara range 34 said she too has lost custody of her child a 
10yearold girl after she first became homeless five years ago 
i lost my selfesteem she said i victimized myself and 
abused my child 
the life of a homeless woman is harsh even without having to 
care for her children ms hummel said 
there is this area in portland where a lot of homeless people 
hang out she said and the cops come around there and they 
treat you like you are nothing ive been hauled into jail five 
times in four months

britain plans to screen up to 90000 pregnant 
women for aids to track the spread of the disease health officials 
said tuesday 
sir donald acheson the governments chief medical officer said 
the voluntary program would begin this summer and last one year 
pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in three regions will 
be asked to submit to blood tests for aids acheson said officials 
hope to screen between 60000 and 90000 women he added 
he said that only women who give consent will be screened 
health minister tony newton said however that if the program 
fails to attract enough volunteers it might be necessary to carry 
out anonymous tests without specific consent 
in view of the difficult ethical and legal issues 
associated with such testing we consider it right that the issue 
should be the subject of further and wider public debate newton 
said 
blood tests can detect the presence of antibodies to the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids a positive 
result indicates exposure to the virus but does not necessarily 
mean a person will develop aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys natural 
immunity to infections and certain cancers and is invariably fatal 
in western europe and the united states male homosexuals and 
intravenous drug abusers are most at risk 
aids is transmitted by sexual contact and through the exchange 
of blood including that which can occur with needlesharing among 
drug addicts it can also be passed from a woman to her baby before 
or at childbirth 
acheson said in a television interview that the government hoped 
largescale screening of pregnant women would give a better 
indication of the spread of aids in britain and might be 
advantageous to the women themselves 
as of the end of april britain had recorded 1463 cases of 
aids including 839 fatal cases 
the screening plan was drawn up by a committee of the public 
health laboratory service which issued a report tuesday through 
the department of health and social security 
dr joe smith the committee chief said pregnant women found to 
be carriers of the aids virus could be counseled about having an 
abortion or about the possible risks of breast feeding

attorney general edwin meese iii said tuesday 
there is no softening whatsoever of the reagan administrations 
zero tolerance antidrug policy despite modifications under which 
the coast guard will be more cautious about seizing boats outside 
the 12mile limit 
under the administrations zero tolerance policy law 
enforcement agencies are cracking down on illegal drug use no 
matter how small the amount 
with the new changes however vessels outside the 12mile limit 
found to be containing drugs will be seized only when there is 
evidence of intent to smuggle them into the united states 
i think that whenever you have a new policy there has to be 
kind of a runningin period where you look at the practical 
difficulties meese told reporters there have been some 
operational refinements but the policy remains the same 
zero tolerance continues to be our policy both inside and 
outside the 12mile limit meese said but the attorney general 
acknowledged that federal law outside 12 miles does relate to 
quantities of narcotics indicating an intent to traffic in or 
smuggle 
meese emphasized that within the applicable laws small 
quantities of narcotics are not going to be ignored as has 
occasionally been the situation in the past 
meese said that in terms of forfeiture of boats on which 
narcotics are found law enforcement officials would be more 
lenient in a case in which narcotics are concealed in a passengers 
suitcase without the knowledge of the ships officers and tougher 
in a seizure of narcotics under control of officers 
meese said that there is no softening whatsoever in the 
administrations zero tolerance policy not at all were making 
sure that the implementation of the zero tolerance policy conforms 
to the law and the rules of evidence 
meanwhile president reagan asked congressional leaders for help 
in creating his suggested bipartisan task force on drugs and named 
four top advisers to represent him on the board 
reagan named chief of staff howard baker treasury secretary 
james baker meese and national security advisor colin powell to 
the panel 
reagan in a speech at the coast guard academy last week called 
for the formation of the bipartisan task force to coordinate the 
fight against illegal drug use he asked that the task force lay 
out its proposals in a report to him and the congressional 
leadership within 45 days 
 
the zero tolerance approach in drug enforcement actions has 
brought sharp criticism as a result of several highly publicized 
seizures in which expensive yachts were taken when only small 
amounts of a drug were found 
officials in san diego recently seized the atlantis ii which 
was used in exploring the wreck of the titanic after a crewman was 
found with a small amount of marijuana the vessel is owned by the 
woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts 
the coast guard also confiscated a 25 million yacht the ark 
royal after less than onetenth of an ounce of marijuana was found 
on board during a search off the yucatan peninsula 
colleen oconnor a spokeswoman for the american civil liberties 
union said the new guidelines reflect a softening of 
administration policy and likely stems from sharp criticsm of the 
zero tolerance program 
the idea of seizing milliondollar yachts for small quantities 
of marijuana had nothing to do with what the administration 
intended for its war on crime said ms oconnor what this 
says to me is they have been burned by their own publicity

education secretary william j bennett on 
tuesday endorsed a national surveys finding that parents no 
matter what their socioeconomic background believe in the 
importance of reading 
in this important survey we found out that parents regard 
reading and reading to their children as a very important 
activity bennett told a news conference 
the interesting thing is the fact that we see agreement among 
all parents fathers and mothers rich and poor black and white 
parents there is no difference no disagreement about the 
importance of reading he said 
the national telephone survey of 1000 people conducted in 
february by the roper organization contacted parents of children 
ages 314 the survey results were based on evaluations of one 
child in each household 
although the survey said only half the parents contacted 
reported that their children were very interested in reading and 
less than half said their child reads for pleasure every day 
bennett maintained that this too was part of parental 
responsibility 
mothers and fathers should read to their children as early as 
possible to teach them that its just plain fun he said 
the survey found that how much children read is directly related 
to their parents educational background and reading habits but it 
said the high value placed on reading cut across parents of all 
educational backgrounds and demographic groups 
parents with less education may not possess the knowledge 
or skill to help their children read the survey said however 
they do not diminish in any way the value of reading nor do they 
lack the desire to help their children become better readers this 
provides a solid ground for optimism about the future 
the release of the survey was the kickoff to the introduction of 
the jello reading rocket a free reading program developed by the 
childrens television workshop to cultivate an interest in reading 
among children in grades 2 through 4 according to mary hiecke 
category manager of jello refrigerated desserts 
among the specific survey findings 
91 percent of parents said reading well is very important to 
their childs success but only twothirds of those with a child 
old enough to read said they were very satisfied with the way that 
child reads 
72 percent of parents believe how much a child reads is 
critical to future success 
72 percent of the parents said it is primarily their 
responsibility to make sure their children develop an interest in 
reading compared with 22 percent who said it is a mutual 
responsibility of parent and school fiftyeight percent of parents 
also said they are responsible for how well their children read 
51 percent of parents said their children are very interested 
in reading outside of school another third said their children are 
somewhat interested while 13 percent said their children were not 
very or not at all interested a figure the survey said translates 
into 5 million children 
44 percent of parents with children old enough to read said 
their child reads for pleasure every day and 43 percent said their 
child reads for pleasure a few times a week 
the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points

iraq said it would resume missile barrages if iran did not stop 
shelling border towns 
the iranians bear full responsibility if they attack our 
cities declared abdul jabar mohsen chief iraqi military 
spokesman such attacks will not go unpunished 
iran claimed iraqi warplanes bombed a northwestern border 
village near sardasht killing one civilian and wounding 10 on 
monday the iranians threatened retaliation if iraq continued 
attacks on towns 
vernon a walters us ambassador to the united nations was 
touring the region and met with sultan qaboos of oman which shares 
control of the strait of hormuz with iran the strait is the only 
sea route to and from the persian gulf 
baghdads official iraqi news agency said iraqi gunners shot 
down an iranian f5 fighterbomber tuesday over iraqs battered 
southern port of basra 
in recent days iran has been attacking iraqi positions near 
basra which has been the target of several iranian thrusts across 
the southern border since the war began in september 1980 
the iranians denied losing any of their dwindling supply of 
usbuilt f5 jets and claimed their ground forces repulsed iraqi 
assaults in the central sector of the 730mile border warfront 
action on the ground has increased recently breaking a lull 
that followed iraqs recapture april 18 of its southern faw 
peninsula which iran had held since february 1986 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency or irna quoted 
the commander for western iran as saying more than 1200 iraqi 
soldiers were killed or wounded in a battle monday 
it quoted the commander whose name was not given as saying the 
iranians repelled attacks by five iraqi brigades on the border town 
of sumar 80 miles northeast of baghdad 
dispatches from irna claimed 89 civilians were killed and 
hundreds wounded by iraqi air raids and shelling since the last 
round in the war of the cities ended april 21 it claimed 50 
people were killed by a chemical attack may 20 on the northern town 
of paveh

capital of suleimaniyeh and other border towns 26 times since april 
21 it has not given casualty figures 
thousands of civilians were killed in missile air and artillery 
attacks from feb 29 to april 21 the last major exchange in the 
war on civilians that has been going on intermittently since 1984 
iran reported 1700 civilians killed and 8500 wounded but 
diplomatic sources said the actual number of casualties probably 
was double that iraq has not been exact but reported hundreds of 
civilian casualties 
walters visited israel syria iraq and kuwait before arriving 
in oman he has reiterated us determination to implement a un 
ceasefire resolution 
he said american efforts include pushing for a followup 
resolution that would impose an arms embargo on iran if it does not 
comply with the first measure 
iraq says it will abide by the resolution which the security 
council passed unanimously last july if iran does the same 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime says no truce is possible 
until iraq is designated the aggressor iraq invaded iran in 
september 1980 after several border skirmishes

republican leaders complained tuesday that the 
house is becoming more autocratic and legislation less substantive 
as democratic leaders increasingly bypass the normal legislative 
process 
if this were a republic in central america wed be talking 
about sending aid to restore democracy said rep lynn martin 
rill 
house minority leader bob michel rill and other gop leaders 
released new statistics showing that while the total number of 
bills has remained about the same in the past decade more and more 
of them are commemorative or other nonsubstantive measures 
in the current twoyear congress the 100th more than 47 
percent of all the bills passed have been commemoratives in the 
95th congress it was just 95 percent 
at the same time more and more bills are brought before the 
house with restrictive debate rules that limit amendments and 
about 40 percent of all house bills are not processed by house 
committees compared with virtually all a decade ago 
we see a less thoughtful process sloppier laws declining 
productivity and an emphasis on the frivolous as against the 
substantive michel said 
rep dick cheney rwyo the chairman of the house republican 
conference pointed his remarks at speaker jim wright dtexas 
its a speaker who will not let the house proceed unless he 
can dictate the outcome cheney said 
wright repeatedly has fought republican efforts to stymie 
democratic initiatives by imposing the restrictive procedures the 
democrats say the procedures are needed because republicans are not 
willing to allow the majority party to act its will

a dairy farmer accused of killing seven 
members of his family was sentenced to die for three of the murders 
tuesday 
in ordering the sentence for james schnick of elkland judge 
john parrish followed the recommendation of a jury that last month 
convicted schnick of killing his wife julie 30 and nephews kirk 
buckner 14 and michael buckner 2 
prosecutors had chosen not to try schnick in four of the 
killings 
i thought the jury had sufficient evidence to render the 
verdict and the sentence that they did parrish said after 
tuesdays hearing 
schnick 37 who stood with his legs shackled shook violently 
as the judge imposed the death sentence the only alternative would 
have been life in prison without possibility of parole 
parrish asked schnick if he believed he had been represented 
adequately by susan chapman a state public defender and webster 
county public defender james mcnabb 
i dont know for sure schnick said adding that he would 
like to talk with other attorneys 
schnick was taken immediately to jefferson city where officials 
at the state prison said 59 inmates already were on death row 
missouri lawmakers approved reinstatement of the death penalty in 
1977 but no one has been executed by the state since 1965 
before sentencing parrish overruled a motion by schnicks 
attorneys for a new trial the state supreme court reviews all 
death penalty cases and will consider issues raised in the motion 
which include an objection to jurors being shown what defense 
attorneys called inflammatory photographs of the victims before 
and after their deaths 
the jury convicted schnick april 14 after a weeklong trial that 
included a videotaped confession by the defendant they recommended 
the death penalty the next day 
schnick also was accused but not tried in the deaths of his 
brotherinlaw steve buckner buckners wife jeannette and their 
two other sons dennis 8 and timmy 6 buckner and mrs schnick 
were brother and sister 
all the victims were killed early sept 25 at the schnick and 
buckner dairy farms schnick claimed that day that kirk buckner 
killed his family before dying in a struggle with schnick and the 
gun used in the shootings was found in kirks right hand but 
authorities suspicions turned to schnick after it was discovered 
kirk was lefthanded 
county prosecutor donald cheever alleged that mrs schnick knew 
her husband had a mistress and may have enlisted the support of her 
brother and his family and asked schnick for a divorce the evening 
before they were killed 
the defense said schnick had told investigators that steve 
buckner had molested mrs schnick when the two were young and that 
tension stemming from that may have led kirk buckner to commit the 
murders

prime minister yitzhak shamir said tuesday that 
elections should be held early to end divisions that cripple the 
government during the arab uprising 
soldiers shot another palestinian dead in the gaza strip 
arab reports said soldiers shot and killed saadi sharhy 52 
while searching his home in the bureij refugee camp in the occupied 
gaza strip the army said he attacked a soldier who opened fire 
a nurse at the ahli hospital in gaza city said sharhy was dead 
on arrival with a gunshot wound in the chest speaking on condition 
of anonymity she quoted sharhys relatives as saying soldiers who 
searched the home were accompanied by israelis in civilian clothes 
army spokesmen said the trouble in bureij occurred shortly 
before 10 pm when a nightly fivehour curfew takes effect 
at least 195 arabs have been killed since violence began dec 8 
among the 15 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
which israel has occupied since capturing them from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 war an israeli soldier and a jewish settler also 
have been killed 
army and hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded a 
28yearold arab on tuesday during disturbances in beit fakir near 
the west bank city of nablus 
shamir who leads the rightwing likud bloc said he wanted to 
move up elections set for november to prevent public 
nervousness over splits within the coalition government 
his partner and rival in the tenuous coalition government 
foreign minister shimon peres of the centerleft labor party 
opposes early elections 
shamir visiting yoqneam in northern israel told reporters 
we have four months until the elections if it were possible to 
cut it short it would be worthwhile to gain time and to prevent 
public nervousness 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said the premier wants early 
elections because the government is paralyzed by policy differences 
between shamir and peres 
the government is neutralized cannot advance toward anything 
it cannot take any major decisions because shimon peres has put the 
whole world against us unless we give in to the international 
conference idea and give up the occupied territories ahimeir 
said 
peres advocates an international peace conference to help solve 
the arabisraeli conflict shamir says such a forum would put 
pressure on israel to make territorial concessions 
likud representatives said they had planned to submit a bill to 
the knesset on wednesday proposing elections in august but dropped 
the plan when it did not gain enough support from other parties a 
shamir aide said 
recent public opinion polls indicate likud would be most likely 
to form israels next government 
the latest poll published may 13 by the daily yediot ahronot had 
the likud and other rightwing parties winning 61 seats in the 
120member parliament 
observers including political scientist yitzhak galnoor of the 
hebrew university and pollster hanoch smith have said the polls 
reflect a hawkish public mood stirred by the palestinian rebellion 
a military court in nablus began the trial tuesday of a 
palestinian woman muneira daoud who is accused of stoning and 
seriously injuring a jewish settler 
according to the court mrs daouds action prompted the settler 
to fire his gun and accidentally kill an israeli teenager in the 
west bank village of beita during unrest april 6 israeli news 
reports said the teenager tirza porat was part of a student 
hiking group 
israeli news reports said soldiers smashed chairs and desks in 
some arab schools in the west bank while using the buildings as 
bases during the rebellion the schools reopened monday after a 
closure of nearly four months 
olivier rafowicz a military spokesman said there was 
serious damage in some of the schools but we are taking care of 
everything and repairing it 
he said soldiers used only 30 of more than 1194 west bank 
school buildings

the number of abortions performed annually 
since president reagans 1980 election has remained stable at 
around 14 million despite the administrations opposition an 
abortion rights advocate says 
theyve politicized the issue but women still need abortions 
and always will barbara radford executive director of the 
national abortion federation said in an interview monday 
the washington dcbased federation held its 12th annual 
meeting in minneapolis this week the gathering attracted about 350 
people who work in counseling centers clinics and hospitals where 
abortions are performed 
radford and others interviewed said that even though polls show 
a strong majority of americans believe abortion should be legally 
available the issue is far from settled one of the key elements 
in the struggle she said is equal access to abortion for the 
poor young women and residents of rural areas 
its a common scenario she said speaking of the st 
paulramsey medical center where antiabortion picketing was a 
factor in the board voting in march to ban elective abortions that 
decision is on hold however pending review by the hospitals 
parent board 
abortion rights advocates also are watching for a ruling from 
the us 8th circuit court of appeals on minnesotas 1981 law 
requiring both parents of a minor girl to be notified before she 
can obtain an abortion 
the law which also allows girls to seek a state judges 
approval instead of her parents was found unconstitutional by 
us district judge donald alsop five years after its passage and 
is being reviewed by the full appeals panel 
in other matters convention delegates heard about a new oral 
drug called ru 486 that acts to prevent a fertilized egg from 
implanting in the uterus the drug is expected to become 
commercially available in france within a few weeks 
it will be several years before american consumers will have 
access to it however predicted dr jane hodgson of st paul 
because of more strict drug approval requirements by the us food 
and drug administration and product liability risks facing 
pharmaceutical firms in the united states 
the drug which women would take if they missed a menstrual 
period and had reason to fear a pregnancy has complications for a 
relatively small percentage of patients involving bleeding and 
ectopic pregnancies hodgson said

the federal official who had refused to endorse 
the evacuation plans for the seabrook nuclear power plant was 
granted his request tuesday to be relieved of duties concerning the 
controversial project 
edward thomas chief of the federal emergency management 
agencys natural and technological hazards division in boston said 
his reputation and career had been jeopardized by verbal attacks 
against him launched by both seabrook proponents and staffers on 
the nuclear regulatory commission 
this is an issue of judgment that has been turned into an 
issue of integrity thomas said in a telephone interview the 
facility administrators and the nrc cant accept that an honest man 
can differ with their assessment and i do 
there is an active campaign under way by the utility and some 
nrc staff members to portray him as a liar thomas charged 
thomas entered the controversy surrounding the 54 billion 
reactor in february when his superiors overruled his objections to 
the state of new hampshires proposed plan for an emergency 
evacuation of seabrookarea beaches 
fema must approve a nuclear facilitys evacuation plans before 
the nrc will issue it an operating liscense 
im not antinuke but i think nuclear power needs regulation 
and must be wellmanaged because there is a potential for 
catastrophe there thomas said im not out to sink seabrook 
ive reviewed and approved six nuclear power plants in new 
england 
 
thousands of people flock to beaches in the plants vicinity 
throughout the hot summer months and thomas said the evacuation 
plan offered no way to help these people if there were an accident 
at seabrook 
we end up with thousands of people who would be unable to be 
protected he said people in sight of the plant would be with 
no form of protection for hours 
a spokesman for fema in washington russell clanahan said that 
agency officials would be testifying about the reasons for femas 
reversal of thomas findings 
thomas said he and henry vickers fema regional director agree 
that he cannot carry out his job and respond to his critics at the 
same time vickers refused comment but thomas said he was relieved 
of his responsibilities to the seabrook project tuesday 
fema is still evaluating the number of personnel and amount of 
resources that are provided for an emergency evacuation in the 
states plan before being granted his request to be relieved of 
his seabrook duties thomas was involved in that evaluation 
he retains his duties related to emergency plans for the six 
other nuclear power plants in new england 
thomas said he was disturbed by comments made by seabrooks 
attorney thomas dignan thomas quoted the attorney as saying that 
if fema didnt back down from its original reservations about new 
hampshires plan there would be blood all over the floor 
thomas said it was a very personalized attack on him and his 
wife took it as a threat on her husbands life 
seabrook spokesman ron sher said the utility and dignan would 
have no comment on the matter 
thomas said that he will defend himself against allegations that 
he is biased against seabrook when called to testify about his 
opposition to the proposed safety plan

a group of conservation organizations on 
tuesday opposed giving new us money to the world bank unless it 
is tied to debt relief for the third world 
sierra club representative larry williams told a congressional 
hearing he also was speaking for the national wildlife federation 
the natural resources defense council the environmental defense 
fund and the environmental policy institute 
without adequate environmental reform within the bank an 
increase on the scale now before this subcommittee suggests that 
environmental disasters may be bankrolled at an ever increasing 
rate williams said 
he agreed with rep bruce a morrison dconn who said that if 
congress propvides the money it will be done in a way to promote 
relief for the third world from its 12 trillion in debt 
it was the third and last of a series of hearings before the 
house banking subcommittee on international development 
institutions 
the world bank is the largest source of aid to the third world 
lending about 17 billion a year it is owned by 151 governments 
it plans to increase its capital so it can lend more than 20 
billion a year in the 1990s enough countries are contributing to 
put through the increase the united states until now the biggest 
supporter of the bank has been holding back 
the reagan administration has pledged the first 70 million 
needed but its proposal has not been supported in congress 
there is sentiment in congress to make the money conditional on 
action for debt relief others have attacked the bank for making 
loans to communist governments and for promoting third world 
industries that compete with industry in the united states

lawyers for oliver l north and two 
codefendants in the irancontra conspiracy case tuesday disputed a 
prosecution claim that hundreds of statements they made to congress 
were not covered by immunity grants 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh was completely wrong on 
the law by claiming that fired national security council aide 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealer albert hakim made numerous statements during last years 
irancontra hearings that could be used as evidence against them 
the defense said in a brief filed in us district court 
walsh seeks to punish defendants for responding fully and in 
good faith to congressional inquiries when compelled to do so over 
vehement objection and for relaying to congress and the nation 
what occurred and why the defense said 
north poindexter and hakim testified under limited grants of 
immunity from prosecution but walsh contends that hundreds of 
statements they made were not covered by socalled use immunity 
because they were not in response to questions posed by the 
irancontra committees 
walsh offered not to use any of the congressional testimony 
during the trial if the court decides other immunity issues in his 
favor 
the defense accused walsh of trying to threaten the court with 
a lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony and then to use that 
threat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with the court 
this tactic is unseemly the defense lawyers said in a joint 
pleading 
north poindexter and hakim are accused along with retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord of conspiring to defraud the 
government by diverting usiran armssale profits to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
secord testified without an immunity grant from congress and 
therefore is not part of his codefendants attempt to overturn the 
indictment on the ground that walshs investigation was tainted by 
illegal use of immunized testimony 
in its latest filing the defense said there is no claim that 
defendants uttered a single word during the course of their 
congressional testimony that was outside the subject matter of the 
congressional inquiry 
north poindexter and hakim did not waive their fifth amendment 
privilege against selfincrimination when they explained their 
answers or sought to provide useful related information to be 
sure their answers were complete and accurate in short the 
whole truth they had sworn to provide 
the defense urged us district judge gerhard a gesell to 
reject walshs argument which would require the court to perform 
the difficult task of determining if each of the hundreds of 
statements was protected by the immunity grant 
these statements the prosecution contends includes 
poindexters testimony that he approved the diversion of funds but 
did not tell president reagan so that he could give the president 
deniability if the operation were later exposed 
they also include poindexters statements that during attorney 
general edwin meese iiis november 1986 investigation poindexter 
destroyed a presidential intelligence finding authorizing cia 
involvement in one 1985 arms shipment to iran 
walsh also claims that norths statements the he destroyed 
documents in october and november 1986 could be used as evidence to 
prove charges that north obstructed meeses inquiry 
in a separate filing tuesday walshs office said it is clear 
beyond doubt that north poindexter and hakim waged a public 
relations battle during their congressional testimony 
in utter defiance of the questions put to them they sought to 
win with speeches and arguments the prosecution brief said

rebels in northern ethiopia claimed 
tuesday they had repulsed an army offensive timed to coincide with 
the current african summit in addis ababa killing or wounding more 
than 9000 soldiers in 11 days 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said the battle occurred 
may 1323 when the army tried to recapture afabet a town 70 miles 
north of the provincial capital asmara that fell to a rebel assault 
in march the claims were made on the clandestine voice of the 
broad masses of eritrea radio 
ethiopia is the host for the organization of african unity 
summit may 1928 which also marks the organizations 25th 
anniversary 
according to the eritrean rebels president mengistu haile 
mariams government ordered an army offensive in an attempt to 
appear victorious during the oaus jubilee celebrations 
they said their fighters thwarted a threepronged drive from 
government strongholds in eritreas eastern plains the rebels 
claimed 5300 soldiers were killed 3800 wounded and 300 taken 
prisoner and said the 102nd airborne division was destroyed 
government forces also lost 33 tanks and 28 other vehicles and 
rebels captured thousands of rifles the radio said 
independent verification of claims in the northern civil war is 
impossible because the marxist government forbids travel to the 
provinces of eritrea and tigre both of which have active 
separatist guerrilla movements 
ethiopia said saturday the army had begun an offensive in both 
provinces it had been expected since rebel victories in march in 
both provinces 
eritrean rebels have fought for 27 years those in tigre went to 
war in 1974

general motors corp has dropped a challenge 
to an order from the environmental protection agency and will 
recall 82600 pontiacs and buicks from the 1981 model year to fix 
pollution control systems epa said tuesday 
the cars in question are equipped with a 43liter sixcylinder 
engine and were sold as the pontiac lemans lemans wagon grand 
prix catalina bonneville and firebird and as the buick regal 
century and century wagon 
epa ordered gm to recall the cars in august 1985 because their 
gasoline evaporative control systems permitted 66 grams of vapor 
to escape during a test for which the maximum vapor emission is 
supposed to be 20 grams 
gm requested a hearing on the order a company statement said 
we believe the cars comply but gm is dropping the challenge 
to prevent unnecessary litigation 
dealers will install a valve in the control system that will 
increase the capacity of the charcoal vapor capture cannister 
epa said owners should wait for a letter from gm before calling 
dealers the letter will be mailed in september and gm said it 
will take that long to make the necessary parts available

iran lost an estimated 50000 
barrels of oil a day from four offshore platforms destroyed by the 
us navy in the persian gulf iranian oil minister gholamreza 
aqazadeh said tuesday 
but he said that iran compensated by boosting production in 
other oilfields 
aqazadeh spoke at a news conference as he wound up visits to abu 
dhabi and dubai the two leading oil producers in the united arab 
emirates 
he said that iraq irans enemy in the gulf war that began in 
september 1980 had failed to halt the flow of iranian oil 
our production is within the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries quota and we are exporting he said 
the respected middle east economic survey published in cyprus 
said monday that iran is producing an estimated 22 million to 23 
million barrels of oil a day 
aqazadeh has been campaigning for production cuts by oil 
producers inside and outside opec to shore up sagging oil prices 
around the cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
aqazadeh has visited oman and is scheduled to visit indonesia 
prior to opecs biannual ministerial session in vienna june 8 
he conceded that irans oil industry has faced some 
problems but he said these had been sorted out and referred to 
plans to build pipelines to terminals outside the gulf where 
irans tankers have been under constant attack from iraqi warplanes 
he also noted talks with the soviet union to reactivate an 
unused gas pipeline to the black sea saying it would be converted 
to carry oil 
aqazadeh repeated iranian charges that the united states helped 
iraq carry out a devastating air raid on irans larak island oil 
terminal in the mouth of the strait of hormuz may 18 five tankers 
were set on fire 
he said iraq could not have carried out the raid without radar 
assistance and us jamming of iranian radar and radio systems us 
officials deny that 
among those with whom aqazadeh held talks were the rulers of 
dubai and neighboring sharjah which with abu dhabi and four other 
emirates form the united arab emirates 
iranian gunboats attacked sharjahs mubarak oilfield during 
clashes with the us navy april 18 after the americans had shelled 
irans sassan and sirrid oil platforms 
us warships destroyed two other iranian platforms last year in 
retaliation for iranian mining of shipping channels and other 
hostile actions 
aqazadeh also said he expected france and iran will develop 
greater economic cooperation following an improvement in 
relations since proiranian extremists in lebanon released three 
french hostages may 4

archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual 
leader of the worlds anglicans said tuesday he may approve women 
bishops someday but not yet 
at the moment i am not in favor of a woman bishops 
consecration the prelate told a news conference i am waiting 
for the right time for that to emerge he would not speculate 
when that might be 
runcie is spiritual head of the state church of england and 
leader of the 70 million anglicans worldwide including 3 million 
episcopalians in the united states 
us episcopalians one of 27 selfgoverning anglican provinces 
have been discussing consecration of a woman bishop and may proceed 
with it before the decade ends 
the issue is controversial because all anglicans look to runcie 
for leadership although there is no central authority in the 
worldwide community 
anglicans are held together by being in communion with the 
archbishop of canterbury if an anglican woman became a bishop he 
would have to accept or reject her 
king henry viii established the church of england when he 
ordered the abolition of papal authority in 1534 after pope clement 
vii refused him a divorce from his first queen catherine of aragon 
lack of a central anglican authority became a problem only in 
the 1970s after the us episcopalians ordained many women as 
priests 
the londonbased movement for the ordination of women said 
tuesday more than 1000 women have become anglican priests most in 
the united states and the others in hong kong canada new zealand 
brazil uganda and kenya 
the church of england is one of the majority of provinces still 
refusing the priesthood to women some bishops and clergy say they 
might eventually accept women as priests but not as bishops 
bishops are deemed to derive their authority the 12 disciples of 
jesus all of whom were men 
women as bishops will be a central issue at this years lambeth 
conference a threeweek meeting of anglican bishops that is held 
every 10 years and begins july 16 in canterbury some anglican 
provinces opposed to women priests may threaten to quit the 
anglican communion if a woman bishop is ordained 
the roman catholic and orthodox churches which have allmale 
priesthoods have said the ordination of women makes it difficult 
for them to see how there can be eventual unity with anglicans 
runcie spoke to reporters at his official lambeth palace 
residence to introduce a collection of speeches he made in new york 
and san francisco in january on the question of authority in 
society and the church he called the 52page booklet authority 
in crisis 
in it he says no one will question that it has been the 
contentious issue of the ordination of women to the priesthood 
and now episcopate which has demonstrated an inadequacy in the 
central structures of the anglican communion

a linguistics expert told a house impeachment 
panel tuesday that a telephone conversation between federal judge 
alcee l hastings and a washington lawyer in october 1981 was 
spoken in code possibly in an attempt to disguise details of a 
bribery conspiracy 
the secretly taperecorded phone call from hastings to his 
lawyer friend william a borders is regarded as crucial to 
charges that hastings a us district court judge in miami sought 
to conceal his role in the alleged bribery scheme by lying under 
oath and fabricating evidence at his trial five years ago 
although hastings was acquitted of conspiring to solicit a 
150000 bribe from two convicted racketeers the house judiciary 
subcommittee on criminal justice is reviewing an investigative 
report by a special panel of appeals court judges which found 
clear and convincing evidence that hastings committed the crime 
and tried to cover it up 
resuming its televised impeachment hearings tuesday the 
subcommittee heard roger w shuy a linguistics professor at 
georgetown university testify about his study of an fbi tape of 
the oct 5 1981 conversation between hastings and borders 
hastings says the 29second conversation concerned some letters 
he had drafted in support of efforts by another friend hemphill 
pride of columbia sc regain his lawyers credentials after he 
completed a threeyear prison term for misappropriation of housing 
funds 
shuy said the recording indicates that borders and hastings 
were using a code to convey information that was not obvious to 
outsiders 
he said his analysis which employed several linguistic 
techniques and sophisticated electronic listening devices led him 
to conclude that a not very wellpracticed code was being used 
involving not only their words but the structure of the 
dialogue 
shuy refused to speculate what hastings and borders were really 
discussing but under questioning by house staff lawyers shuy 
conceded it was possible they were talking about details of payment 
of the alleged bribe and whether hastings should issue a reciprocal 
court order returning a major portion of forfeited assets seized 
from the racketeers 
the panel is studying whether to recommend that the full house 
impeach hastings on the charges filed by a panel of the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals if the house votes to impeach and the 
senate convicts him in a subsequent trial hastings would be 
removed from the federal bench 
the subcommittee has subpoenaed borders to appear when it 
resumes its televised hearings wednesday but he was expected to 
refuse to testify 
borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 of arranging 
the bribe allegedly intended for hastings but he has consistently 
refused to testify about his close friend 
house investigators are eager to ask borders whether hastings 
was aware that his friend was arranging a bribe for him hastings 
insists that he knew nothing of the bribery scheme and accuses 
borders of trading on his name to shake down the two racketeers 
frank and tom romano 
roberto martinez a former assistant us attorney in miami 
testified tuesday that two major undercover investigations were 
abandoned in september 1985 after they were divulged by a leak of 
information attributed to hastings 
martinez said hastings learned of the investigations of union 
corruption on the miami waterfront and corrupt zoning practices by 
city officials in hialeah fla when martinez gave hastings 
routine progress reports on courtapproved use of wiretaps in both 
cases 
hastings allegedly mentioned the investigations to dade county 
mayor steve clark who later told federal law enforcement officials 
that hastings was the source of the leak martinez said 
rep john bryant dtexas said the justice department decided 
not to prosecute because it did not believe it could win a 
conviction 
martinez said under questioning that although he had 
tremendous confidence in judge hastings before the incident he 
now believed it would be dangerous for hastings to have access 
to sensitive information about federal criminal investigations

the senates democratic and republican leaders 
agreed tuesday the chamber still has time to approve the 
mediumrange missile treaty before president reagans summit 
meeting next week as long as the senate votes to halt debate by 
conservative republicans 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva filed a petition 
tuesday to halt debate that measure known as a cloture vote 
cannot come up for a vote before thursday 
its conceivable that we could finish the work on the treaty 
by friday or saturday byrd told reporters after a white house 
meeting with reagan to discuss the may 29june 2 summit between the 
president and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan agreed with byrd that 
time remains before the summit to ratify the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty we can make it if we start staying in late 
and we file cloture today he told reporters 
a successful cloture motion which would limit debate requires 
60 votes far more than 60 senators have supported the treaty in a 
series of earlyround test votes approval of a cloture motion 
thursday would begin a 30hour clock for debate meaning a vote on 
the treaty could occur friday 
byrd said he wants the senate to act before reagan meets 
gorbachev i think the presidents hand would be strengthened 
there and i think it would be in the interests of our own country 
to have the president with the instruments of ratification 
gop conservatives opposed to the pact have used senate rules 
which are designed to protect the minority to delay a vote on the 
pact signed dec 8 by reagan and gorbachev 
reagan setting the stage for the summit said tuesday he hoped 
to conclude a treaty to cut longrange nuclear arsenals before his 
term expires in eight months but acknowledged that might not be 
possible 
it is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrary 
deadline that will determine the timetable reagan said in an 
address beamed across europe on the us information agencys 
worldnet satellite service the speech was taped monday in the 
oval office 
the inf treaty requires the elimination within three years of 
all us and soviet missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3400 
miles 
when the senate finally votes on the pact ratification is 
assured dole noted because only 67 votes are required the 
question is how many votes are going to be for it he said is 
it going to be 94 95 92 its not even close 
in a senate speech dole appealed to his fellow party members to 
support reagan i hope as the republican leader speaking for my 
republican president whos in the last year of his second term 
that we might be able to accommodate him in this instance 
but sen jesse helms rnc the chief opponent refused to 
mute his criticism 
helms noted his long support of reagan but said i think hes 
wrong on this treaty i think hes been misled i think hes been 
misguided and my conscience will not allow me not to pursue the 
obvious defects of this treaty 
helms noted that nine gopbacked amendments have been defeated 
overwhelmingly 
all amendments have been rejected because the state department 
came to the foreign relations committee and said there must be no 
amendments to this treaty because the soviets wont like it i 
happen to be one of those senators who dont care whether the 
soviets like it or not 
referring to gorbachev helms said i dont care whether we 
offend him or not lets get it right the first time before the 
senate attaches its approval to the ratification of the treaty 
later tuesday sen david durenberger rminn said he 
supported the move to halt debate why should a small majority 
deprive the vast majority of this and the people of this country 
its will ratification before the summit 
sen dale bumpers dark agreed telling his colleagues 
were going to approve this treaty its only a question of how 
many votes i think itll get 90 votes 
he accused opponents of nuclear idolatry and said the 
ideologues will never never go gently into the night

cubas vice president carlos rafael 
rodriguez said tuesday that the era of reaganism clearly is 
over in the united states the cuban news agency prensa latina 
reported 
the dispatch from havana monitored in mexico city said 
rodriguez told local reporters that president reagans 
aggressiveness and his threats of using violence against cuba 
nicaragua panama have no future in current conditions 
he said such policies are even less relevant when a certain 
global agreement between the united states and the soviet union is 
being glimpsed on humanitys most crucial problems the dispatch 
said 
prensa latina quoted rodriguez as also saying that many believe 
that relations between communist cuba and the united states can be 
reestablished only when there is a conservative administration in 
washington 
bush is that type of leader but nothing indicates that he is 
disposed to take such a decisive step the cuban vice president 
was quoted as saying of vice president george bush who now is 
considered certain to be the republican partys presidential 
nominee 
rodriguez said the frontrunning democratic candidate for 
president michael dukakis has announced a latin american policy 
that would be radically different from reagans and more similar to 
development plans proposed by presidents franklin d roosevelt and 
john f kennedy 
the conditions are different and for our part we are prepared 
for dialogue on the base of mutual respect the elimination of the 
us blockade and the liquidation of the irritating thorn that we 
have in our presence of the military base of guantanamo on cuban 
territory the cuban official was quoted as saying

president reagan combined praise with 
criticism for the kremlin on tuesday in advance of the superpower 
summit while the white house prodded the senate to ratify a 
ussoviet arms treaty before the president arrives in moscow this 
weekend 
senate leaders trying to spare reagan the embarrassment of 
meeting soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev without a ratified 
treaty announced plans to cut off debate on the accord which bans 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty which reagan and 
gorbachev signed dec 8 seems assured of approval by an 
overwhelming majority but has been stalled by a handful of 
opponents 
after a speech wednesday morning on the south grounds of the 
white house reagan will fly to helsinki finland arriving in the 
predawn hours thursday 
he will remain there until sunday morning when he boards air 
force one to travel to moscow it will be the first visit to the 
soviet union for the 77yearold reagan and will mark the first 
time in 14 years that an american president has visited moscow 
almost immediately after his arrival reagan and gorbachev will 
begin talks their fourth summit in 30 months 
in a speech broadcast to europe on tuesday reagan said us 
relations with moscow must be guided by realism 
we do not expect a quick radical transformation of the soviet 
system he said we do not expect to turn a corner one day to 
find that all our problems have gone away because our adversary has 
been transformed there still remain profound political and moral 
differences between the soviet system and our own 
he hailed the soviets for progress on human rights specifically 
in terms of the release of political and religious prisoners an 
increase in emigration resolution of cases of divided families and 
separated spouses and an easing of censorship 
yet despite this progress the human rights situation in the 
soviet union and eastern europe is far from good reagan added 
he cited a string of problems including restraints on religion 
peaceful demonstrations freedom of movement and unofficial 
publications 
the presidents remarks were broadcast overseas on the us 
information agencys worldnet satellite service the speech was 
taped monday in the oval office 
the arms treaty which crowned reagans summit with gorbachev in 
washington last december was endorsed monday by the supreme 
soviet the nominal parliament 
toning down summit expectations assistant secretary of state 
rozanne ridgway told reporters tuesday dont look at this summit 
in terms of its potential for drama or breakthroughs but rather its 
essence is that of continuity 
however she said the summit outcome isnt precooked and 
never has been with these two leaders 
gorbachev said in an interview published this week in the 
washington post and newsweek magazine that he would propose 
ussoviet cooperation on an unmanned flight to mars however 
ridgway said sucha project would involve technology transfer issues 
that need very careful examination 
she said that although the soviets may propose it officially 
i would not expect the united states side to be in a position to 
respond at this time 
in addition to three minor arms agreements she said there would 
be documents to sign on cultural programs fishing civilian 
nuclear reactor safety transportation technologies and a packet of 
understandings on coast guardmaritime issues 
amid other summit preparations tuesday reagan gave an interview 
to five european journalists he also conferred with his foreign 
intelligence advisory board on arms control strategy and briefed 
his cabinet on the summit agenda 
reagan also met at the white house with democratic and 
republican leaders of congress and got assurances the senate 
probably would ratify the inf pact in time for him to exchange 
ratification documents with gorbachev in moscow 
while we should never place artificial deadlines on matters of 
policy and national security the time has come for prompt 
action white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
he said senate majority leader robert byrd dwva told reagan 
that in all likelihood the senate will be able to act on the 
treaty by friday 
howard baker the white house chief of staff will stay behind 
in washington when reagan leaves to follow the senate debate on the 
treaty which calls for the elimination over three years of nuclear 
missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3400 miles 
i asked the presidents consent to stay here while the treaty 
is still before the senate baker said tuesday in an interview on 
the cbs evening news 
i hope to take ratification documents to the president in 
moscow 
the spokesman said baker will travel to moscow on saturday and 
be on hand when reagan lands the next day 
reagan in his speech was silent on the race for ratification 
of the treaty he said however he hoped that before he leaves 
office he can conclude an even more ambitious agreement with 
gorbachev to reduce strategic nuclear weapons 
however he said it is the requirements of a good treaty and 
not some arbitrary deadline that will determine the timetable 
fitzwater said reagan was looking forward to the journey 
particularly his meetings with soviet writers artists filmmakers 
dissidents refuseniks and others 
he thinks he has an important message about freedom and 
democracy for them and he thinks its also helpful to encourage 
them as they seek more freedoms under the glasnost policies 
fitzwater said

prime minister sadek elmahdi says he has 
presented sudanese rebels with a proposal to end the countrys 
fiveyear civil war a magazine reported tuesday 
in an interview with the weekly alashiqa elmahdi said he 
outlined the peace plan in a message to john garang leader of the 
sudan peoples liberation army 
he gave no details of the plan saying only that it was conveyed 
by foreign minister hussein suleiman abusaleh 
the government meanwhile said its forces overran 12 rebel 
positions in the upper nile province near the border with ethiopia 
killing 300 rebels 
major general abduljalil almusharaf commander of the fifth 
infantry division in kordofan said that only three government 
soldiers were killed in the fighting several rebels were taken 
prisoner and a large amount of arms and ammunition were captured 
he said 
he told the official sudan news agency suna the military 
operation was part of a plan to cripple rebel activities in south 
korddofan during the approaching rainy season 
he did not say when exactly the fighting took place 
abusaleh the foreign minister is currently in ethiopias 
capital addis ababa for a meeting of the ministerial council of 
the organization of african unity or oau he met on monday with 
president mengistu haile mariam of ethiopia whom sudan repeatedly 
has charged with backing the sudanese rebellion 
it was not clear whether elmahdis message to garang was given 
to mengistu for relay or was delivered in some other way garang is 
known to have a base of operations inside neighboring ethiopia 
elmahdi told alashiqa that he would be prepared to meet with 
garang if the rebel leader responded favorably to the peace 
proposal 
elmahdi due in addis ababa wednesday for the oau summit said 
he also will hold talks with mengistu on bilateral relations 
since elmahdi took office in 1986 his government has held 
several rounds of preliminary peace talks with the rebels in 
britain and ethiopia all the sessions failed

his army began fighting five years ago in sudans three southern 
provinces where most people are christian or animist they demand

ptl will have to go off the air and close 
its theme park as early as next month if contributions to the 
television ministry keep dwindling the new trustee told a us 
bankruptcy court judge tuesday 
after the hearing ptl contributors made tearful pleas to 
trustee mc red benton to allow banished ptl founder jim 
bakker to appear on the cable tv network to solicit donations they 
said would save the ministry 
everybody else has tried and failed why not bakker said 
paul wood a spokesman for a group of ptls lifetime partners the 
major contributors to the ministry 
bakker resigned in march 1987 as the story of his tryst with 
jessica hahn and her hush money payments was about to break he 
turned over control to the rev jerry falwell who resigned in 
october after accusing bakker of using ministry funds to live 
lavishly 
wood said contributors he represents had pledged 81 million 
that would be turned over to the ministry once bakker was allowed 
on the ptl network to ask for forgiveness 
benton told the contributors several of them weeping as they 
pleaded with him in the courtroom that his objective was to save 
ptl 
my primary duty is to get the creditors paid he added 
ptl with current debts of about 130 million and assets of 160 
million filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in 
bankruptcy court in june 1987 benton who was appointed friday to 
succeed former christian broadcasting network executive david clark 
as trustee was in court to gain approval of a plan to liquidate 
assets to the extent necessary to pay debts 
after telling the judge about the ministrys declining income he 
said the next step is to shut down and that im prepared to 
do 
but benton said after the hearing he wouldnt rule out the 
proposal allowing bakkers limited return once he saw it in 
writing if its the best and logical next step for the 
ministry 
ptl attorney bradford leggett said if the contributors had as 
much financial backing as they claim the logical thing to do would 
be to put their money together and present a proposal to buy ptl 
and pay its debts 
wood acknowledged later that they couldnt raise the money 
without getting bakker on the network 
in the hearing before judge rufus reynolds benton said were 
considerably short of money now and were going to have to have 
some money soon to operate contributions have about dried up 
in the past three weeks contributions have dwindled from 
60000 a day to 40000 a day to 22000 a day last week benton 
said it costs 27000 a day just to pay the network affiliates he 
said later 
we have the problem of keeping the doors open benton 
testified adding that they also may not be able to keep airing the 
ptl club tv show the primary method of gathering contributions 
that pay for operating expenses 
marjorie gray a lifetime partner who said she has donated 
36000 to ptl told benton that the reason people stopped giving 
is that they arent happy with the leadership 
she also said contributors are disheartened by ptls 
negotiations with nonreligious buyers including national 
basketball association expansion franchise owner george shinn who 
wants to build a sports complex on the grounds 
reynolds said he approved the concept of a revised 
reorganization plan filed last week that called for the trustee to 
liquidate ptls assets as necessary the proposal outlined plans to 
sell the 2300acre heritage usa theme park in fort mill and allow 
a separate nonprofit corporation lease the property required to 
operate its church and network television programs

president jose napoleon duarte 
and members of the major political parties on tuesday rejected a 
proposal by leftist rebels to hold a new round of peace talks next 
week 
rafael moran castaneda who belongs to the national conciliation 
party said that it is not the opportune moment to hold 
discussions with the guerrillas farabundo marti national 
liberation front and its political ally the democratic 
revolutionary front 
he said the political parties need to resolve a dispute over 
control of the national assembly that has prevented installation of 
the 60member congress elected march 20 
this situation must first be overcome in order to be able to 
give a show of unity moran castaneda said 
col carlos figueroa a member of the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance or arena said we have decided that first 
the assembly has to be formed and that is where we are going to 
work out the peace proposal 
the rebels earlier this month offered to resume talks to try to 
end the 8year war with the ussupported government an 
estimated 65000 people the majority of them civilians have died 
in the civil war 
the guerrilla front is a coalition of five rebel armies it is 
closely allied with the democratic revolutionary front a loose 
federation of leftist parties groups and student and peasant 
unions 
the rebels called for monsignor arturo rivera damas the roman 
catholic archbishop of san salvador to mediate the talks 
government and rebel representatives last met oct 20 in san 
salvador two rounds of talks held in 1984 ended in a stalemate 
duarte and representatives of the armed forces and major 
political parties began a series of meetings last week aimed at 
working out a peace proposal to offer the rebels 
moran castaneda said those meetings will continue 
the crisis in the legislature centers on who controls the 
majority of deputies 
thirty deputies of arena took their seats may 1 and claim to 
have constituted the assembly 
duartes christian democrats contend that arena lacks the 
majority necessary to install the legislature the christian 
democrats were resoundingly defeated in the legislative election 
losing their parliamentary majority 
the christian democrats and the conciliation party who claim 30 
deputies between them have formed an informal alliance to block 
arenas control of the legislature 
one of the christian democrats 23 deputies is claimed by arena 
which charges the seat was stolen through electoral fraud

a french soldier on patrol shot and 
killed a melanesian tuesday on the east coast of this french 
pacific territory officials said 
because of the shooting a meeting between leaders of the 
separatist kanak socialist national liberation front and a special 
government commission from paris was postponed 
officials said the shooting happened about 230 am 1130 am 
monday near the village of touho about 210 miles northeast of 
noumea 
a statement from the army said the soldiers saw a light then 
discovered two melanesians one carrying a weapon when the other 
one made a move toward his pocket a soldier feeling threatened 
opened fire and mortally wounded one of the two men the army 
said 
new caledonia 1000 miles east of australia has been the scene 
of sporadic violence since november 1984 the latest upsurge began 
in april when melanesian separatists attacked a police station on 
the island of ouvea killed four policemen and abducted two dozen 
others 
on may 5 french security forces stormed the cave where the 
hostages were being held killing 19 melanesians and freeing the 
captives two soldiers died 
last week premier michel rocard sent a special sixmember 
mission to new caledonia to reestablish a dialogue with residents 
no dialogue no negotiation can take place as long as a state 
of war imposed by the armed forces continues said a statement 
from the kanak fronts politburo after the meeting was postponed 
the army said it was investigating the shooting death 
native melanesians or kanaks represent about 43 percent of new 
caledonias 145000 residents and most of them favor independence 
the rest of the population is made up of european settlers asians 
and polynesians most of whom prefer to remain french 
meanwhile in paris there was continued controversy over the 
may 5 assault on the cave which the socialists claim was carried 
out under political pressure from the conservative government then 
in power to enhance the presidential election prospects of premier 
jacques chirac 
chirac lost to president francois mitterrand a socialist 
over the weekend the newspaper le monde published excerpts from 
a confidential report written by maj philippe legorjus head of a 
french antiterrorist squad that made the assault le monde said 
legorjus was critical of government officials for rejecting 
negotiations in favor of military action 
bernard pons the former minister for overseas territories who 
was in charge of the operation said tuesday the account was 
twisted and deformed and asked that the complete report be 
published

the romeo and juliet which opened tuesday at 
offbroadways public theater may not be the most riveting of 
revivals but its lack of excitement cant be blamed on the actors 
who play shakespeares starcrossed lovers 
peter macnicol and cynthia nixon bring a passion to their roles 
a conviction and sense of purpose that is missing from the rest of 
this diffuse production mismanaged by director les waters 
the pintsized macnicol who would seem to be an unlikely 
leading man brandishes a boyish enthusiasm in keeping with romeos 
impulsiveness hes quicktempered argumentative and ardent in his 
pursuit of juliet the plays inevitable tragedy seems logical 
given the actions of this most emotional of romeos 
miss nixon is a radiant juliet she matches macnicol in 
intensity whats more her voice is better equipped to handle the 
poetry and she gives the language its due 
when the two lovers are on stage together the play exerts 
interest if not a complete fascination unfortunately theres the 
rest of verona and all those feuding montagues and captulets to 
watch and worry about 
what waters has assembled is a polyglot cast and he imposed no 
discernible sense of style the accents range from brooklyn to 
dublin and points in between the acting at times seems more 
suitable for west side story or in one case of disastrous 
overplaying la cage aux folles 
the actors are at sea those who sink include an affected 
courtney b vance who flounces his way through the role of 
mercutio milo oshea who turns friar lawrence into a cardboard 
barry fitzgerald anne meara who substitutes grimaces for emotion 
and wb brydons capulet who bullies and bellows his way through 
the play spraying the other actors and everyone sitting in the 
first row 
the actors who succeed particularly peter francis james as 
benvolio and bradley whitford as paris do so because their 
performances are lowkey and serve the story not themselves 
heidi landesman has designed an odd setting a white hightech 
balcony that wouldnt look out of place in a soho loft it cuts 
across a large crumbling red column that suggests a decaying and 
corrupt renaissance society the two ideas dont quite mesh 
the exuberant sword fights were devised by bh barry and they 
are models of stage fencing particularly romeos unnerving battle 
with tybalt 
romeo and juliet is the third production in the public 
theaters shakespeare marathon the theater will present all 36 of 
shakespeares plays during a sixyear period 
in quality waters production falls somewhere between the 
publics exotic and entertaining midsummer nights dream and 
its dismal allstar julius caesar this romeo and juliet 
can be savored for its lovers only

tamil rebels killed eight indian 
soldiers in northern sri lanka and suffered 20 to 25 casualties 
themselves indian diplomats said tuesday 
the diplomats cannot be identified under briefing rules 
they said six indian soldiers including an officer were killed 
and all the tamil casualties occurred when the indians raided a 
rebel hideout on monday near mullaitivu town 120 miles northeast 
of colombo 
they did not know how many of the 2025 tamils were killed and 
how many wounded 
a bomb explosion on tuesday killed two indian soldiers and 
wounded two at palali village 12 miles northeast of jaffna town 
the diplomats said 
the deaths raised to at least 441 the number of indian troops 
killed in sri lanka since october when the troops began an 
offensive against tamil rebels 
more than 50000 indian troops are in sri lanka under an accord 
signed in july 1987 by india and sri lanka to end the tamil 
separatist guerrilla war for a homeland in the north and east of 
the indian ocean island nation 
the peace pact has been rejected by the most powerful of the 
tamil groups the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
the agreement grants some autonomy to the tamil minority in 
exchange for a surrender of arms by the rebels 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up for 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people the sinhalese who are buddhists 
account for about 75 percent 
the tamil say the sinhalese who control the government and the 
military discriminate against them

jorge obrador capellini began work tuesday as 
mexico citys acting police chief following the dismissal of 10 top 
police commanders due to allegations of a torture death 
the federal district attorney general renato sales gasque said 
at obrador capellinis swearing in ceremony late monday we will 
not tolerate acts of corruption nor any act that could affect the 
credibility that the community must have in the judicial police of 
this city 
earlier monday the firing of jesus miyazawa director of the 
citys judicial police five deputy directors and four commanders 
was announced in connection with an investigation into the death of 
a police official in the adjoining state of mexico 
the government news agency notimex quoted sales gasque as saying 
the dismissals occurred because of acts against the dignity of a 
person it said the attorney general would give details at a news 
conference this week 
authorities said pablo estanislao aguilar alcala a judicial 
police commander in the state of mexico was tortured to death last 
week possibly in a revenge killing by members of the mexico city 
judicial police 
a statement from the attorney generals office said what 
happened compels sales gasque to take this decision with the aim 
moreover of thoroughly restructuring the department of the judicial 
police of mexico city 
the federal district makes up the core of the mexico city 
metropolitan area of more than 18 million people it is surrounded 
on three sides by the state of mexico many of the areas teeming 
slums and rapidly growing suburbs are in that jurisdiction 
the liberal daily la jornada said in a frontpage editorial 
tuesday that the abyss of police criminality causes vertigo and 
that a full investigation would find that the case prompting the 
dismissal was not the only incident of wrongdoing 
president miguel de la madrid who completes his sixyear term 
this year has made moral renewal in government a cornerstone 
of his administration

fire broke out tuesday at an oil tank 
farm and threatened to ignite millions of gallons of gasoline 
before it was brought under control at least 20000 mexicans fled 
their homes and one estimate said 200000 were evacuated 
a spiral of fire and smoke soared more than 150 feet above the 
oilproducts storage area of the government oil monopoly pemex in 
the northern residential area of chihuahua a state capital in 
northern mexico with 550000 people 
but the only casualties reported were a few firefighters with 
light burns authorities reported that the blaze began at 1010 
am 1212 pm edt and was brought under control about eight 
hours later 
at about 8 pm residents were told they could return home 
said francisco cortez coronado a pemex spokesman 
he added the causes for the explosion and fire are not real 
clear they are still investigating what we do know is that two 
men were soldering to repair a line at the base of the tank and 
that the top part exploded 
alfonso sanchez gallo the chihuahua state governments chief 
spokesman said in a telephone interview tuesday evening 
everything is perfectly controlled and there is no risk that the 
fire might spread to other tanks 
flames continued to shoot up and thick black smoke poured from 
the 39foot high steel tank more than nine hours after the 
explosion the top of the tank collapsed inward from the fierce 
heat 
there were scorch marks from the fire on a tank 30 yards away 
the government news agency notimex said the burning tank with a 
capacity of 1260000 gallons contained an extremely light 
petroleum while 14 other tanks with a capacity of 1040000 
gallons each held gasoline four were very close to the 
burning tank it said 
there was an explosion but it was very muffled and then the 
fire started said plant foreman arturo rubio 
the initial report from pemex headquarters in mexico city said 
the blast came at 1120 am 120 pm edt but cortez coronado 
later said it was 1010 am 
the site lies in a densely populated area about eight miles 
north of the city center 
estimates varied widely as to how many residents were affected 
reporters at the newspaper novedades de chihuahua said about 
20000 people left their homes 
notimex quoted local fire department commander mario perez as 
saying soldiers police and volunteers evacuated more than 100000 
people from a twomile radius around the plant 
later notimex gave its own estimate of 200000 people evacuated 
luis alonso hernandez 26 a worker at the plant said you 
could see the flames and black smoke from miles away and there 
were all kinds of accidents in the road the whole city was 
running 
spokesman sanchez gallo said officials were concerned that 
shooting flames would touch off a nearby gasoline tank adding it 
was a question of cooling off the other tank 
he reported that the 300 firefighters were draining gasoline 
from the 14 other tanks and there is no risk that the fire might 
spread to neighboring tanks since they are being chilled with 
strong sprays of cold water 
red cross radio dispatcher olga rojo said efforts to control the 
blaze were initially hampered by a scarcity of water much of 
northern mexico is suffering from drought this season 
chihuahua lies 233 miles south of the texas border at el paso 
it is the capital of sprawling chihuahua state the largest of 
mexicos 31 states 
notimex said plans had called for the storage tanks to be 
relocated some months ago but new facilities have not been 
completed it said area residents had been protesting pemexs 
presence there 
on nov 19 1984 more than 500 people were killed at an 
explosion of storage tanks owned by pemex in san juan ixhuatepec a 
working class neighborhood on the northern outskirts of mexico city

president daniel ortega late tuesday 
renewed his demand that peace talks scheduled to begin wednesday 
with the contra rebels take place in managua 
the usbacked rebels said they intended to meet with 
negotiators of the leftist sandinista government in the small 
village of sapoa on the costa rican border 
but ortega said that holding the discussions in sapoa would be 
to put the conversations at the brink of breaking off the two 
sides signed a preliminary peace plan in the village on march 23 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the archbishop of managua who 
has been an observer in the talks said i believe that the 
meeting is doubtful because the two sides are deadlocked on the 
site 
he said joao baena soares secretarygeneral of the organization 
of american states who has mediated the discussions called off 
his trip to managua because of the disagreement 
a regrettable impasse has arisen in the conversations 
obando y bravo said 
ortega said baena soares is ready to come to nicaragua as soon 
as it is confirmed that the meeting will take place in managua 
the contras have resisted holding the three days of talks in 
managua 
they have complained that during two previous sessions the 
government kept them cooped up in a hotel near the airport on the 
outskirts of managua and refused to let them move about freely in 
the capital and meet with domestic opposition groups 
but ortega said tuesday that the contras would be allowed to 
meet with officials of opposition political parties the roman 
catholic church and the opposition newspaper la prensa moreover 
he said their relatives could visit them at the hotel 
to meet in sapoa the president said would mark a setback in 
political terms 
it would be to accept that all that has been achieved since 
the first contacts late last year can be lost he said 
the two sides have been trying since the initial peace agreement 
was arranged to work out details for a permanent ceasefire they 
agreed on a 60day truce to give them time to negotiate a lasting 
ceasefire 
ortega announced monday that he would extend unilaterally the 
temporary truce due to run out on may 30 an additional 30 days 
the peace talks are designed to bring an end to the more than 
six years of war between the sandinistas and the contras ortega 
has said the fighting has killed 26500 people and caused 3 
billion in damage to the economy 
in washington tuesday an aide to house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said the contras planned to offer to lay down their arms 
on sept 1 as part of a comprehensive peace accord to be presented 
to the nicaraguan government wednesday

whats cooking at the national restaurant 
association convention the debate du jour is whether to tip or not 
to tip 
some restaurateurs are calling for a switch to a flat service 
charge as is common in europe but many find the idea unappetizing 
a federal tax law that went into effect jan 1 requires 
restaurants to pay taxes on waiters tips and if waiters fudge on 
the amount of tips they get the internal revenue service can hold 
restaurants liable for taxes on the unreported gratuities

tass doesnt call him a lunatic any more nor 
does pravda compare ronald reagan to the nazis a particularly 
cutting label in a country that cannot forget it lost 20 million 
people to the nazis in world war ii 
in fact the russians have come to look upon reagan as 
trustworthy even grandfatherly 
although still hardly immune to criticism the american 
president is being shown to the soviet people as a less 
confrontational figure as he prepares to visit moscow for his 
fourth summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev 
reagan because of his strong anticommunist views before he 
became president in 1981 had long been the target of strident 
criticism in the soviet media but his image has matured and grown 
more complex and human during the period of gorbachevs 
glasnost or greater openness 
characterizations of foreign leaders by the staterun press are 
particularly important in the soviet union because citizens have 
little else on which to base their impressions few have contact 
with foreigners or access to foreign publications until recently 
broadcasts of foreign radio stations were jammed 
reagans anticommunism as filtered through the official media 
gave russians a first image as this hostile even brutal man 
much in the american cowboy mold shoot first and ask questions 
later soviet radio and tv commentator vladimir pozner said in an 
interview 
and the soviet media made much of the presidents own harshest 
comments such as his march 8 1983 description of the soviet 
union as an evil empire 
after reagan offered that description in a speech to christian 
evangelists the soviet news agency tass said reagans 
administration thought only in terms of confrontation and 
bellicose lunatic anticommunism 
seven months later following the usled invasion of grenada 
tass commentator konstantin kuryev said reagans explanation for 
the undertaking was made with the simplemindedness 
characteristic of him 
pravda the communist party daily compared reagan to a nazi 
which has an especially derogatory in russia 
in august 1984 after reagans inadvertantly recorded and 
humorously intended remark that the united states would begin 
bombing the soviet union in five minutes the soviet government 
fumed in a statement issued through the official press that 
reagans words were unprecendentedly hostile toward the ussr and 
dangerous to the course of peace 
but the official image of reagan began to warm with the coming 
of the 1985 geneva summit the first facetoface meeting of us 
and soviet leaders in more than a decade 
and reagans own description of his attitude toward dealing with 
the soviets trust but verify was shown to millions of 
soviet and american television viewers alike during gorbachevs 
visit to washington last december the remark could be used as well 
to sum up the cautious but constructive atmosphere the soviet media 
have built around superpower relations in the last years of 
reagans presidency 
during the geneva summit soviet television began to broadcast 
appearances by reagan his picture appeared for the first time on 
the front page of pravda 
reagan started coming across to soviets as a more homemade 
grandfatherly gentleman perhaps not the greatest mind in the 
world but not as threatening as he was once perceived pozner 
said 
moscow resident anna likhacheva 64 told the associated press 
at the tiime of the geneva summit that it seems to me from the 
expression on his face that he does not favor bad relations but i 
think a small circle of bad people influence him 
pozner said gorbachevs emphasis on greater openness has allowed 
soviet media to give more than just a onedimensional treatment to 
reagan were doing a better job than we did before basically i 
think the media is being fairer he said 
nonetheless the commentator added reagan would win few 
popularity contests among soviet citizens 
but after the last summit in december soviet television viewers 
heard gorbachev tell a washington news conference i think we now 
have more understanding between the president and myself its 
more businesslike its more of a constructive approach and ill 
even venture to say that i think we trust each other more 
the softer treatment in general doesnt mean reagan is immune to 
criticism on the issues that divide the superpowers soviet media 
still strikes back when he attacks soviet foreign and human rights 
policies 
and after reagans critical foreign policy speech in 
springfield mass in april the official media gave wide display 
to gorbachevs retort that we are not going to reeducate the 
united states and do not recognize that it has any right to 
reeducate us

it wasnt ego or politics that led jan scruggs 
to build a memorial to the vietnam veterans in washington 
it was a chance meeting with another veteran at a fastfood 
restaurant not long after they had come home both had known 
another soldier who was killed in vietnam scruggs was haunted by 
the fact that neither could remember the soldiers name 
the scene is part of the movie to heal a nation which nbc 
will air this sunday appropriately enough on memorial day weekend 
it is a different kind of vietnam movie about scruggs battle to 
win a memorial to those who fought an unpopular war 
scruggs is played by eric roberts a 1985 oscar nominee for the 
movie runaway train the movie is based on the book scruggs 
wrote with joel swerdlow 
since its dedication on veterans day 1982 the wall as it 
is known has become one of the most popular monuments in 
washington attracting up to 20000 visitors a day 
the unconventional design of the memorial was highly 
controversial when it was unveiled a low black granite v cut 
below ground level that draws visitors into it then reflects their 
images in the shiny surface etched with the names of those who died 
in the movie scruggs receives a letter from a youngster whose 
father died in the conflict the boy encloses 5 his father gave 
him to buy a hamburger the day he left the 5 the letter says is 
to put his name on the memorial 
the names says scruggs its got to have all the names 
a couple of years later fellow vietnam veteran and attorney bob 
doubek scott paulin walks into a pentagon office and tells a 
records clerk he needs some information on casualties from the 
vietnam war fine the clerk says which ones all of them 
doubek says 
the 58156 names inscribed on the wall set the vietnam veterans 
memorial apart from other monuments and the names made it 
nonpolitical it is as much antiwar statement as a tribute 
scruggs was able to see that need for a symbol that would draw 
the nation together as he says in the movie this is not a 
monument its a memorial 
the movie directed by michael pressman and written by lionel 
chetwynd depicts the process that forced scruggs to break with 
some of his fellow veterans and allow a nonmilitary panel to 
select an appropriate design the result was the stark wall 
envisioned by 21yearold student maya ying lin selected from 
1421 proposals 
influential backers of the memorial including h ross perot 
would not acquiesce until the memorial fund agreed to add a 
traditional statue of three battleweary gis it is a powerful work 
on its own and stands on a rise in front of the memorial 
to heal a nation is scruggs story a former army grunt 
he enlisted former officers with fancy law degrees to cut through 
the red tape and political resistance that confronted his vision 
but it was scruggs determination that got the memorial built in 
record time and there on the mall by the lincoln memorial not off 
in some outoftheway spot by the side of a highway that the 
government tried to steer him to 
since scruggs is the center of the drama roberts performance 
is the centerpiece of the movie and he infuses scruggs with an 
enthusiasm that transcends a sometimes plodding tale 
glynnis oconnor plays scruggs wife becky who at first thinks 
he should just forget the war and get on with his life but comes 
to realize that he can never get on with his future until this 
project reconciles him with his past marshall colt plays john 
wheeler the lawyer who heads up the vietnam veterans memorial fund 
sen charles mac mathias rmd is played by laurence 
luckinbill as a thoughtful effective lawmaker who understands not 
just the veterans need for the memorial but the nations as well

jay tarses who has lost a string of critically 
praised comedies to the network programmers axe says hell 
probably quit tv if his last remaining show the days and nights 
of molly dodd is canned by nbc 
molly moves tonight to a new time period on wednesdays in 
a lastditch effort to avoid cancellation 
tarses had learned only recently that abc had canceled his other 
show the slap maxwell story earlier nbc announced a fall 
schedule with no mention of molly dodd leaving faint hope it 
will return after this sixweek run is over 
abcs decision didnt particularly surprise tarses who wasnt 
happy with the way slap was going but he said molly 
shocks me i cant deal with it whenever i think about it it just 
puzzles me so much i just dont get it we keep passing whatever 
tests there are and it doesnt seem to matter to mr t 
mr t is brandon tartikoff president of nbc entertainment he 
maintains that molly dodd is an interesting show but not 
necessarily a commercial show 
tarses says that since nbc has become the no 1 network ratings 
are more important than anything else 
they have no 1 parties over there he joked they put 
on their devil outfits and dance around a bonfire and throw people 
with college educations into a pit or something 
molly made its debut in the spring of 1987 and got high 
ratings but it was off the air for a year before nbc could find a 
new time period for it it went back in march in the hitladen 
thursdaynight lineup but tartikoff yanked it after a few weeks 
because it didnt rank in the top 10 only the top 13 night 
court the show it replaced temporarily had ranked in the top 10 
in a news conference last week after announcing the fall 
schedule tartikoff held out some slight hope for the show 
wednesday night at 9 oclock if it were to deliver the same 
kind of shares that it was getting on thursday night dropping some 
10 and 12 points off of cheers that would be a hit for us 
said tartikoff 
if it gets a 25 share off of 37 on thursday night that is 
what i consider viewer rejection of the show and giving up too 
many rating points on a night when we could dominate by simply 
putting night court back there 
molly will lead into cheers tonight but then will be 
paired with another halfhour comedy sara a longcanceled 
series that starred geena davis and bronson pinchot as lawyers 
both have gone on to other projects 
tarses thinks it unlikely molly will get the 160 rating it 
had been getting on thursday nights after it moves to wednesday 
where the previous show in the time period the hourlong highway 
to heaven was getting much lower ratings 
the rating is a percentage of 886 million us homes with 
televisions and it largely determines how much the network can 
charge for a commercial 
he tartikoff seems to be so concerned with statistics and so 
concerned with being no 1 and pulverizing the opposition he may 
be disregarding some barometers that are very clear said tarses 
that there are shows of quality that do have an audience maybe 
not a 35share audience but a bunch of people who are being 
deprived of some television shows because of numbers that i dont 
believe are really true 
tartikoff last week held out slim hope for molly if there 
is that loyal core that will follow this show almost anywhere if 
they show up anywhere close to the numbers it had on thursday 
night this could be god forbid for jay tarses he might actually 
have a commercial show on his hands i dont know what hed do with 
it 
tarses has had a run of heartbreaks such as open all night 
and buffalo bill which hecocreated with tom patchett now 
slap is gone and molly may be too 
i dont want to go through this any more tarses said i 
did good work molly and slap were good shows weve spent a 
lot of time a lot of care and the result is that in the end you 
have rejection and ive been there before with shows that were 
good too i dont know how many times i have to go through it 
there are other things i could do in this business

the west european allies are looking to 
next weeks superpower summit in moscow with little hope of an arms 
control breakthrough and with little apparent fear of a breakdown 
the europeans want the meeting to spur further improvement in 
ussoviet relations but they seemingly would be satisified if it 
simply avoided any slippage in the momentum toward broader arms 
control 
for the europeans in this case specific agreements are less 
important than atmospherics said ivo dalder a nuclear arms 
specialist at the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies 
the us allies say they are only mildly disappointed that no 
deal on deep cuts in longrange nuclear arms will be struck during 
the sundaythursday summit between president reagan and soviet 
communist party general secretary mikhail gorbachev 
theyre pleased that both sides have pledged to continue 
bargaining after the meeting 
its not the date thats important but the political will to 
continue on the path started at the 1986 ussoviet summit in 
iceland where outlines of a deal on strategic or longrange 
missiles were worked out said jacques poos the foreign minister 
of luxembourg 
of more concern to the european allies is the timing of senate 
ratification of the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf 
treaty eliminating the superpowers intermediaterange missiles 
the accord was signed at last decembers superpower summit in 
washington 
the us missiles to be eliminated under the inf treaty are 
based in western europe 
the europeans see reagans fourth meeting with gorbachev as a 
chance to inject new momentum into the process of improving 
eastwest relations particularly as it applies to the allies 
links with their neighbors in communist eastern europe 
a chief european concern is how gorbachevs efforts to open up 
parts of soviet society and restructure the economy will influence 
developments in eastern europe according to government officials 
private defense specialists nato diplomats and military planners 
interviewed recently 
this concern has been heightened by the recent wave of labor 
unrest in poland triggered by the communist governments latest 
economic reforms 
we dont want to base the whole eastwest relationship on arms 
control said peter corterier the west german secretarygeneral 
of the north atlantic assembly a nato support group in brussels 
some european leaders including british prime minister margaret 
thatcher have said they hope reagan uses the moscow meeting to 
express western support for the social and economic changes 
gorbachev is trying to make 
the europeans say they are not worried by the recent slowdown in 
ussoviet negotiations on a strategic arms reduction treaty 
which would cut the number of intercontinental nuclear missiles by 
half 
you can easily swallow the fact that the start treaty is not 
there said ton frinking a member of the dutch parliament and 
president of the north atlantic assembly thats a pity but its 
a technical rather than a political problem we hope 
although none of the superpowers longrange nuclear weapons is 
based in western europe they do pose a direct threat to the 
continent 
west german gen hanshenning sandrart natos senior commander 
in central europe said recently that even if the superpowers scrap 
all their mediumrange nuclear arms as planned the soviets will 
remain capable of striking european territory with such longrange 
forces as submarinelaunched cruise missiles and mobile landbased 
ss24 and ss25 missiles 
there is still a strategic threat to the depths of western 
europe he said 
a ussoviet agreement to cut longrange nuclear weapons by 50 
percent would not eliminate this threat to nato territory but it 
would give the soviets much less flexibility in targeting europe 
sandrart said 
having lost hope for a start deal at the moscow summit some 
europeans appear at least mildly concerned about a possible setback 
in the negotiations which have been hung up on a variety of 
technical issues as well as soviet objections to reagans strategic 
defense initiative to develop a spacebased defense against 
ballistic missiles 
its very important that the two superpowers if they are not 
actually in agreement at least agree not to work one against the 
other poos said 
the europeans apparently are not fearful that reagan will pull 
off an unwelcome surprise in his arms control discussions with 
gorbachev 
france and some other allies are still grumbling about reagans 
october 1986 meeting with gorbachev in which he discussed a global 
elimination of ballistic missiles an idea that had not been 
studied by nato and which the europeans later called dangerous to 
western security 
he must have learned some lessons from his previous summits 
said frinking the dutch parliamentarian 
others said their concerns about reagans performance had been 
diminished by evidence that the president appears to understand 
more about soviet desires and intentions than when he first met 
gorbachev in 1985 
he has a more sophisticated view of whats going on in the 
soviet union now said corterier

the two most commonly used words in business 
advertising probably are quality and service in practice they 
might be among the most neglected 
this dichotomy still shows in surveys of american corporate 
practices even though the consequences are well understood by 
management and labor having caused them serious problems in the 
past 
further evidence comes in an analysis of 105 responses to a 
survey of fortune 500 companies by organizational dynamics inc a 
management consulting and training company based in burlington 
mass 
the survey found executives are virtually unanimous in their 
belief that responsibility for quality must be shared by everyone 
in the company almost all agreed that everyone in the company 
affects customer satisfaction 
the questioning continued leading to this finding 
in the typical company surveyed just 25 percent of workers were 
involved in quality improvement activities only 17 percent of the 
respondents said their company involves more than half its 
employees 
the results underscore what many quality improvement specialists 
have been saying for years that one of the major quality defects 
of american industry is the failure to follow through on corporate 
goals 
the problem isnt one of recognition almost every executive 
will explain that quality and service are foremost among corporate 
goals awareness probably has never been higher the consequences 
of poor quality are known 
in fact the current emphasis on quality arises directly from 
the painful experience american industry had with poor quality 
during the 1960s when us companies began losing entire markets 
to the japanese who embraced quality 
oddly much of the quality control practiced by the japanese 
emerged from the us experience and from americans who had raised 
it to the level of a science including w edwards deming and 
armand v feigenbaum 
oddly some major american corporations intentionally let 
quality to deteriorate contending it was more costeffective to 
allow flawed products to leave the factory to be fixed later by 
service departments 
it didnt work largely because aftersale service was likewise 
flawed that is the quality of service was as bad as the quality 
of the product and customers quickly became aware of it why not 
they sensed they were being exploited 
much of the subsequent recovery of us industry now showing up 
as a resurgence of manufacturing productivity gains improved 
trade statistics and healthier profits is a consequence of efforts 
to improve quality and service 
but survey after survey shows that the notion of quality and 
service is more deeply imbedded than the practice everyone cheers 
for improvements but not nearly as many go to work after the 
cheering stops 
in the organizational dynamics survey respondents agreed that 
quality and service control are matters that involve employees at 
all levels but only onethird said they shared customer 
satisfaction data with all employees 
as one of the foremost authorities on quality control philip b 
crosby has stated often he even wrote a book about it 
quality is free 
it may not cost even a penny to begin with he says but if it 
costs anything at all the cost comes back many times in higher 
sales 
underlying his assumption is faith in human beings to do 
superior work if given the direction and the motivation and if 
given a return on their efforts to contribute

on a cloudy midweek afternoon car 
after car slows to a crawl as the occupants crane their necks to 
catch a glimpse of this resort towns most famous landmark the 
vacation retreat of george bush 
no matter that the vice president wasnt home or that the 
oceanfront dwelling was virtually obscured by fog 
the drivebys and gawkers on ocean avenue are bound to multiply 
this summer as tourists ignore the noparking signs and pull to the 
side of the narrow twolane road to snap photographs of the home of 
the prospective republican nominee for president 
less than two miles away help wanted signs festoon the 
stores in and around dock square as kennebunkport awakens from its 
offseason slumber to begin what may be remembered as its last 
summer of relative obscurity 
by next year at this time the southern maine town might occupy 
a niche in history as the favored retreat of a sitting president 
joining the ranks of such farflung places as plains ga san 
clemente calif and hyannis mass that were transformed into 
news datelines recognized worldwide 
already townspeople are pondering what a bush victory in 
november would mean to this town of 4500 whose population 
balloons to more than 25000 in the summer 
thats what were asking ourselves mostly what if and 
sometimes the answers that come out are pretty scary said police 
chief john a prescott whose concerns focus on the flow of traffic 
past the vice presidents compound at walkers point named for 
bushs maternal grandfather 
more than 18000 cars a day spill into dock square in the middle 
of the summer according to the states latest traffic count so 
if you figure half those cars went down ocean avenue thats 9000 
cars and if even 10 percent of those cars stop and park where they 
shouldnt that really fouls things up the chief said 
to ease potential traffic tieups prescott recently proposed 
that ocean avenue be made oneway but town selectmen scuttled the 
suggestion after a public hearing last month 
the chief also expresses concern about the likelihood of larger 
and more frequent protest demonstrations outside the bush home 
there have been only a handful during his tenure as vice president 
and the prospect of television vans blocking traffic when hes in 
town 
bushs election would surely increase the size of the press 
corps that follows him to kennebunkport making it harder than ever 
to get a hotel room at the height of the season 
a subject of perennial speculation is whether local lobster 
fishermen would still be allowed to tend their traps within 
shouting distance of bushs property while he is in town 
some have suggested that security would actually diminish if the 
secret service declared the waters offlimits lobstermen who 
frequent the cove know each other and are traditionally wary of 
strangers who wander into territory they regard as their own 
residents town officials and merchants appear proud and 
protective of bush characterizing him as a good friend and 
neighbor whose familys roots here date back to the turn of the 
century 
by all accounts he keeps a low profile and tries to cause no 
disruption by his presence townspeople in turn respect his 
privacy and avoid attempts at commercial exploitation 
bush generally spends three weeks each summer in kennebunkport 
playing golf and tennis and fishing for mackerel or bluefish from 
his speedboat docked in the kennebunk river he patronizes local 
stores and restaurants attends nearby churches and occasionally 
participates in community activities last year he delivered the 
speech at the high school commencement and in years past he has 
appeared in dock square for the towns memorial day parade 
townspeople question whether a bush victory in november could 
generate bigger midsummer crowds than the ones that already swarm 
through the downtown area past the clothing boutiques art 
galleries upscale restaurants and souvenir shops 
in summertime were very near gridlock anyway and how much 
more effect it can have is questionable said roland f drew 
chairman of the board of selectmen and a longtime friend of the 
vice president 
the place is a zoo in the summertime anyway agreed howard 
noyes proprietor of a sandwich shop and gift store known as the 
old salts pantry 
kennebunkport home of such stately old hotels as the colony and 
the shawmut inn has attracted wellheeled tourists from boston and 
new york since the late 1800s while maintaining a dual identity as 
a fishing port 
in the past 15 years however the biggest growth has been 
tourism with commercial development fanning out from dock square 
while real estate values have skyrocketed virtually everywhere 
tourists wont find george bush tshirts key chains or other 
novelty items for sale in his home town a cursory stroll through 
the business district turned up just one article with his name on 
it a picture postcard of the walkers point home 
but there are no other bushrelated items amid the racks of 
kennebunkport sweatshirts and shelves of lobster and seagull 
mementos that line nathan shmalos store 
people dont want to do anything tacky to hurt him or his 
candidacy we dont want to turn him into a gimmick or a 
sideshow shmalo said 
although townspeople take pride in bushs achievements 
selectman drew doubts kennebunkport would ever erect a road sign or 
billboard to trumpet his presence 
lord no i think hed be furious drew said i would hope 
wed never do anything like that were not that kind of town

where straight lines dominated he built angles 
where there was boxlike conformity he brought character 
in a more than threedecade career real estate developer gerald 
d hines has created some of the most dynamic members of americas 
skyline boldly stylish buildings that are urban landmarks 
in houston his developments include the darkly angular pennzoil 
place the neogothic republicbank center and the artdeco transco 
tower all of which helped define the character of their corporate 
tenants as well as the city 
people dont want blandness said hines who gauges success 
partly by how well a building is accepted by the public 
it goes on the front of the telephone book or it becomes a 
city classic since all the taxi drivers know the good 
buildings said hines if you are appealing only to a thin 
veneer of the art community im not so sure that is very 
acceptable 
since leaving the air conditioning business in 1957 and 
undertaking his first renovation of a houston home to a small 
office building hines through his sole proprietorship gerald d 
hines interests has built an estimated 365 buildings in 34 cities 
with a combined value of about 45 billion 
using noted architects like philip johnson and im pei hines 
works to create developments fitting a geographic individualism he 
calls the culture of a city 
i dont think we have a style our style is no style hines 
said our buildings are so different from year to year city to 
city 
and unlike some other developers hines has taken a mavericks 
approach to financing often issuing large equity positions in his 
projects to investors rather than assuming large amounts of debt 
he also seeks to lock up leasing commitments for projects before 
they are built rather than building more speculatively with few or 
no firm commitments 
known for his attention to detail hines may evaluate prices 
paid for steel or help select the kind of doorknobs and hinges 
tasks often delegated by others 
thats pretty far down said houston architect nolan willis 
who has participated in some of hines projects others would not 
go down into that detail 
for hines detail is paramount to success 
the culmination of a project is a summation of the detail 
hines said if you dont look at the detail then the rest of it 
wont be put together well 
the transco tower project for example called for a large 
amount of pink granite to be used as part of the buildings lobby 
although the natural choice was texas pink granite which could be 
acquired close to houston hines found he could buy similar stone 
from spain have it fabricated in italy and shipped to houston for 
about 25 percent less 
hines is also known for building expensive scale models of 
proposed buildings using them in wellorchestrated presentations 
to potential clients rather than relying upon artists drawings 
and complicated blueprints 
people are used to seeing things in three dimensions hines

according to hines architecturally striking structures can be 
built for as little as 3 percent to 5 percent more than 
conventional skyscrapers allowing rents to remain competitive 
the conception the financial conception those are very 
creative parts of our business hines said how you bring 
together tenants and architecture to minimize risk those are very 
exciting

s tough with its gangs 
</TEXT>

when crack cooks on irine tates street 
the air smells of easy money simmering violence and the bitter 
promise of a long hot summer 
spring rain disperses the acrid odor of drugs boiling so the 
dealers on the corner wait until the sky opens wide before they 
turn up the heat tate knows that little trick she knows that 
nasty smell 
it burns your eyes it burns inside your nose and burns your 
tongue she said of the caustic stench created by cooking cocaine 
and baking soda into the powerful derivative called crack it 
goes down your throat and stays there a long time just burning the 
hell out of you 
eighteen months ago she smelled only the sweet fragrance of 
roses around her bungalow that was before california gang members 
lusting after astronomical profits rolled in cooking their stuff 
and clogging her street with nonstop drug traffic 
the gangs brought crack for sale fear for free north to 
anchorage and east to denver and beyond invading mediumsized 
cities unaccustomed to hardcore los angelesstyle drugdealing and 
violence 
across the west quiet streets like tates have become sales 
territories for los angeles two preeminent black gangs the crips 
and the bloods ever searching for bigger better drug markets 
business is booming and southern california police are getting 
tough so expansion makes good economic and survival sense 
the crack that sells for 600 in southern california might bring 
as much as 3000 along the northern reaches of the interstate 5 
corridor ample incentive for gang members to hit the highway 
word on the street is that portland is easy pickings that reno 
is ready and that seattle is the land of milk and honey for crips 
and bloods with money crack and a certain entrepreneurial spirit 
untouched communities dangle before them like ripe fruit waiting to 
be plucked and squeezed dry 
they call it putting the move on a city said portland 
police sgt neil crannel who was working patrol in the housing 
projects when he first noticed the la connection in autumn 86 a 
year ago crannel became the forces gang resources officer and 
began keeping track of gangrelated crimes to date they number 
more than 280 including at least 20 gunshot wounds 
seattle has recorded at least seven gangrelated murders five 
in 1987 and two so far this year in one recent sixmonth period 
sacramento arrested 77 known gang members from los angeles from 
1984 to 1986 felony drugrelated gang cases soared 2000 percent 
in march police in reno nev arrested four youths with ties 
to southern california crips for raping a 13yearold girl and 
stealing 1 from her one of the accused was the same age as the 
victim police said the gang members laughed when the charges were 
read in court 
a los angeles police consultant came in to tell reno police what 
they were up against intelligence gathering is tough and cities 
around the west constantly share information los angeles 
authorities provide critical gang education but it goes only so 
far 
when you get out of la crannel said all the same rules 
dont apply 
crips and bloods who might have killed each other in turf 
battles in southern california have been known to cooperate in 
portland seattle and anchorage at least until theyve taken over 
the local drug trade crips and bloods have shared crack houses in 
portland and street corners in seattle police say 
the bottom line is selling the stuff seattle police officer 
dan fordyce said if it means working with one another theyll 
do that if it means shooting at one another theyll do that 
when it comes time to battle they pull out heavyduty weapons 
including uzis sovietmade ak47s sawedoff shotguns pieces that 
resemble small gatling guns and weapons with laser sights 
sacramento police have switched to 9mm semiautomatics another 
popular gang choice our policeissued 38s just were not 
standing up to some of the firepower we were running into sgt

the gang members typically wear the latest fashions carry 
beepers on their belts and keep cellular telephones in their shiny 
bmws cadillacs and blazers the very picture of young urban 
professionals 
their sophistication can be frightening irine tate befriended 
one crip who showed her a spreadsheet on his five houses one of 
which appeared to rake in 50000 a day 
how much they got from each house how much went to where from 
his expenses he had it all broken right down she said he 
was only 20 years old and he told me its a business 
once the business takes hold shutting it down becomes close to 
impossible police and concerned citizens are all too aware of how 
the los angeles gang wars have escalated many have been to see for 
themselves they return to their cities and neighborhoods with a 
clear message act now and act tough 
the gangs can only be as strong and big as the community 
allows them to be said sgt steve hollingsworth who monitors 
gang activity for the portland school police you need to attack 
very quickly in the infant stages dont let it fester and develop 
roots or it will cost you much more to deal with later 
a team of gang experts from california and washington state 
recently traveled to alaska to teach law officers there how to 
squash its growing gang problem anchorage police have identified a 
dozen california gang members in their city some blueclad crips 
and a blood dressed in red were conspicuous at the anchorage 
airport 
its always been real easy money up here anchorage police 
investigator ron weatherman said of the alaska drug market they 
come in undercut everybody and just take over 
in seattle aggressive local law enforcement in league with 
federal authorities prompted california gang members to limit their 
activities to threeday junkets selling their drugs and returning 
south rather than setting up more permanent crack houses of the 
citys seven gang killings five defendants either have pleaded or 
been charged and federal charges can mean no bail and stiff 
sentences 
seattles strategy we stay in their face said police lt 
gerald adams of the intelligence section 
were trying to show them that seattle is not a hospitable 
place to come and deal drugs said capt john pirak who heads 
two gangoriented units if they come to seattle and are 
apprehended theyre going to go to jail 
sacramento which first recognized its la gang connection three 
years ago has adopted a similar stance using redlight 
abatement laws to force landlords to shut down crack houses or 
risk having their property padlocked by police for a year 
last year the california capital spent 16 million on 
narcotics enforcement including more than 400000 in overtime 
the effort has paid off arrests were up 132 percent 
when these people first started coming up here we interviewed 
a los angeles gang member burns said he said the word on the 
street in la was that sacramento was a good market a little river 
village and they could come up here and just about do what they 
wanted 
a few months ago we arrested a guy from los angeles he 
said the word on the street in la is dont get popped in 
sacramento because theyll slamdunk you 
portland suffering from too little jail space cannot say the 
same unlike sacramento denver phoenix seattle and las vegas 
oregons largest city has no gang squad and no room to lock up gang 
members most are cited and go on their way 
weve arrested various ones and theyre out the next day or 
the same evening crannel said the whole system seems to be 
screwed up right now 
on the citys hardhit racially mixed inner northeast side 
residents estimate there are at least 300 crack houses police are 
stretched painfully thin 
it takes at least five different people calling fr any house 
to move up on the priority list said sharon mccormack who 
chairs a 55member youth gangs task force in some blocks you 
dont have five people who will do that in some blocks you dont 
have five phones 
portland residents worry about whats in store this summer when 
authorities crank up the heat in southern california people 1000 
miles away and beyond feel it 
everybodys talking about that mccormack said if los 
angeles is successful what does that mean as far as spillover for 
portland seattle has a stronger police presence and were caught 
in the middle 
in this community a lot of people are saying its going to be 
one hot summer

at 2 in the morning one day three 
years ago barbara mcfalls marched up to the door of a crack house 
and demanded her daughter 
if mcfalls thought shed left gangs and drugs behind when she 
moved from east los angeles 14 years before the horrible truth 
came home that night the daughter now a successful career woman 
never returned to that scene but the mother did picketing crack 
houses lecturing gang members and trying to save the children of 
people who didnt care enough to do it themselves 
weve got the la connection and its bad said mcfalls who 
lives in the meadowview neighborhood on sacramentos south side 
for sale signs line her street but mcfalls has no intention 
of running instead she breaks up fights corrals gang members to 
help register voters and urges witnesses to gang violence to 
testify she persuaded two gang members wanted for crimes to 
surrender driving one to juvenile hall herself and baked sweet 
potato pies at the request of another who was being shipped to the 
california youth authority 
i get out there face to face with them thats the only way 
you can deal with them and they respect you for it too said 
mcfalls who walks amid the bloods red and the crips blue with 
her own colors the red and yellow of the meadowview improvement 
committee 
you just cant be scared you have to leave your fear tucked 
away somewhere if you let them know you dont like whats going on 
in your neighborhood theyll move 
some 550 miles north on interstate 5 irine tate never stops 
letting them know how she feels one day last winter she painted 
no drug parking in white block letters down the middle of her 
portland ore street on all four corners along her retaining 
wall and on her neighbors garage door 
they said we live around here we pay rent i said you 
dont pay no damn rent around here so get the hell off my block 
the gang members didnt like the deadhonest drughating tate 
but they had to respect her shed sit on her porch and watch their 
comings and goings listen to their deals and learn all she could 
then shed call the police something her neighbors were afraid to 
do 
tate and mcfalls realize the risks they take in opposing the 
lucrative drug trade mcfalls has a panic box in her home push 
the button and police surround her block within two minutes 
tate owns a bulletproof vest one day a gang member told her it 
wouldnt do any good weve got armorpiercing bullets he 
said if we want you bad enough well get you 
so far the gangs havent wanted to hurt either woman both of 
whom temper fear with faith if god wants you to die then you 
die tate said if god wants me to die with them shooting me 
then im going to die with them shooting me 
one crip tried to buy her silence for 10000 but she wasnt 
selling 
i could have paid my bills off and been sitting pretty if id 
taken that money she said over the drone of a tv soap opera 
and whose life would i have ruined 
id lose my own selfrespect id lose my dignity my pride in 
myself and what would the kids think of me 
the kids see all hear all they know whos cooking whos 
selling and how much theyre asking kids as young as 6 have become 
lookouts and shills who steer crack customers to one gangs house 
and away from a rivals 
the answer say mcfalls and ed elmore another member of the 
meadowview improvement committee is to give kids guidance and 
alternatives give them jobs in the summer and places to go besides 
the streets put back into the community the money and hope that 
crack dealers take out 
a year ago mcfalls street was crowded with gang members 
dealing crack as openly as if they were selling tshirts or 
hamburgers now theyve retreated indoors paying rent to single 
mothers and old people willing to turn their homes into crack 
houses 
four california gang members moved in with one of tates 
neighbors and the young mother now smokes crack and wonders how to 
get rid of her roommates mcfalls gets phone calls in the wee hours 
from a woman who became an addict gave birth to a onepound baby 
and now hears disembodied voices as she aimlessly rides buses 
around the west 
dont you realize what youre doing to your own people an 
infuriated tate once asked a gang member youre ruining their 
minds so they dont know how to think youre killing them 
the crip sat thinking for a long time i guess youre right 
he told her later but i may as well be making the money as 
somebody else

with no chance of an agreement on strategic arms 
american officials are focusing on other issues they hope will make 
president reagans trip to moscow more than just a travelogue 
when the moscow summit the fourth between reagan and soviet 
communist party general secretary mikhail gorbachev was set late 
last year both sides were optimistic they could sign a treaty 
reducing longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
but the negotiations are far from complete snagged on 
verification and the us strategic defense initiative among other 
things 
among the other issues to be discussed during the moscow summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
reagan and gorbachev are expected to sign two protocols in 
moscow dealing with underground nuclear explosions both are 
designed to improve monitoring procedures 
a ussoviet treaty signed in 1974 limits underground blasts 
the only nuclear explosions still legal to 150 kilotons at the 
summit the two leaders are likely to set the ground rules for 
joint experiments in nevada and in semipalatinsk in july and august 
to measure the force of detonations 
the americans prefer a system known as cortex which involves 
inserting a cable in a shaft about 30 feet from the test and taking 
measurements from it while the soviets like the seismic system 
used for earthquakes 
both systems will be used at the us and soviet tests 
a 1976 treaty set the same 150kiloton ceiling for socalled 
peaceful blasts these are nuclear explosions to change the courses 
of rivers or for other nonmilitary purposes the united states 
wants to be able to monitor blasts above the 50kiloton level 
neither side now engages in such testing 
still reagan has said if verification measures to guard against 
cheating are improved he would submit the unratified treaties to 
the senate for approval

top us officials say the summit will give both sides an 
opportunity to review where we are regarding conventional 
weapons in europe but a bilateral accord is unlikely because of 
ongoing negotiations in vienna between the countries of the warsaw 
pact and nato alliance there have been hints that gorbachev might 
unilaterally withdraw 50000 to 100000 troops from eastern europe 
to gain a public relations advantage in the negotiations 
moscow has conceded for the first time that it has an advantage 
over the west in some military categories the pentagon estimates 
the soviets have 230 divisions in eastern europe compared to 121 
for nato 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like conventional arms the issue of chemical weapons is the 
subject of multilateral treaty negotiations under way in geneva 
hence the united states is reluctant to sign anything although 
the issue will be raised 
the soviets have been pressing the united states to endorse a 
sweeping ban on lethal chemical weapons but us officials say 
that push is politically motivated what the united states wants is 
a truly global chemical weapons agreement that can be verified 
assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway said 
the soviets have agreed to join the verification process but 
they havent filed the necessary plans to safeguard against 
cheating us officials estimate the soviets have 300000 tons of 
chemical weapons about six times the us amount

the future of afghanistan will be raised even though the soviets 
have agreed to withdraw from the country under a un agreement 
signed this spring specifically at issue is the fate of 5 million 
refugees living in pakistan and iran 
the top regional issue however is angola where us and soviet 
officials have been trying to arrange a withdrawal of 40000 cuban 
troops from the country withdrawal would have to be accompanied by 
implementation of us resolution 435 calling for an end to the 
south african occupation of namibia 
otherwise the united states wants the soviets to stop selling 
weapons to iran in the gulf war and to pressure vietnam to remove 
its troops from cambodia 
on the mideast the soviets want a fullblown international 
peace conference to reach a settlement while the united states 
favors a mostly ceremonial conference that would lead to bilateral 
talks between israel and its arab neighbors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the two sides hope to arrive at a threeyear agreement on 
educational and cultural exchanges extending the accord signed at 
geneva in november 1985 the exchanges monitored by the us 
information agency have mushroomed as americans and soviets seek 
to learn more about each other through visits and study but the 
exchanges are still lopsided with many more americans visiting the 
soviet union than vice versa under the agreements high school and 
college students have traveled abroad and entertainers from both 
countries have toured 
</TEXT>

reagan can be expected to broach the human rights issue 
particularly the plight of thousands of soviet jews who have been 
prohibited from emigrating meantime both sides are moving toward 
an agreement that would allow american psychiatrists to visit 
soviet mental hospitals to determine if dissidents are being 
imprisoned in the hospitals the soviets would carry out reciprocal 
visits to us mental hospitals

negotiators have drawn up but may not sign a draft agreement 
that calls for annual ussoviet meetings to promote freer 
scientific data exchanges it includes regulations to protect 
scientific ideas and gives the united states possible access to 
soviet research fields such as nuclear fusion mathematical theory 
and metallurgy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the united states has agreed to help a soviet unmanned probe of 
the planet mars in 1994 but the two sides are far from signing an

farmers stepped up loan repayments in 
early 1988 while loan demand remained weak leaving midwest farm 
banks flush with cash the federal reserve bank of chicago reports 
the new report released monday is the latest confirmation of 
reduced financial stress among banks that survived the severe farm 
recession of the mid1980s 
a survey of 525 bankers in the chicago feds fivestate district 
said 46 percent of those questioned reported farm loan repayment 
rates in the first quarter exceeded the pace of a year earlier and 
only 2 percent reported slower repayments 
in addition the percentage of district banks with undesirably 
high ratios of loans to deposits has dropped to 4 percent as of the 
first quarter of this year thats down from 58 percent in the 
first quarter of 1979 a period of soaring land values and 
doubledigit inflation when bankers were almost stumbling over one 
another to make farm loans 
with faster paydowns on existing farm loans and sluggish new 
loan demand agricultural bankers continue to have ample funds for 
lending and relatively low loantodeposit ratios said chicago 
fed economist gary benjamin about 42 percent of the bankers 
reported that the availability of funds for farm loans in the first 
quarter exceeded the yearearlier level while less than 5 percent 
reported a decline 
an index of loan demand in the chicago feds district based on 
the bankers responses to the survey remained weak in the first 
quarter but still was the highest in nearly three years benjamin 
reported 
the weakness has reflected several factors including large 
government farm program payments curtailed crop plantings and 
until recently declines in farm production expenses and cuts in 
capital expenditures benjamin said although still weak there 
is some evidence that loan demand is starting to strengthen 
in the first quarter for example 28 percent of the bankers 
noted that loan demand was up and 26 percent reported a decline 
looking at the current quarter however 29 percent said they 
expected farm lending to be up from a year earlier while just 19 
percent said they expected a decline 
benjamin cited several emerging trends for the expected growth 
in farm lending 
crop acreage after declining in recent years is likely to 
hold steady in 1988 he said government payments to farmers 
are trending down and farm sector cash production expenses after 
declining 15 percent over the last three years may edge up in 1988 
due to higher input prices 
benjamin also reported that the stress in farm loan portfolios 
at banks has abated considerably 
bad farm loans that commercial banks nationwide charged off 
against earnings last year plunged about 55 percent to 530 
million compared with about 12 billion in 1986 13 billion in 
1985 and 900 million in 1984 when such information first became 
available as the farm crisis was deepening 
within the chicago feds district which includes iowa 
illinois indiana wisconsin and michigan banks net chargeoffs 
for farm loans fell last year to about 110 million from 350 
million in 1986 nearly 400 million in 1985 and about 200 million 
in 1984 benjamin said in his report on credit conditions 
benjamin said estimates of outstanding farm debt nationwide were 
between 141 billion and 143 billion at the end of last year down 
from 155 billion in 1986 thats more than 25 percent below the 
peak of almost 193 billion in 1983 
benjamin also says preliminary estimates based on reports by 
lenders indicate that banks moved ahead of the troubled farm credit 
system last year to become the leading lender serving farmers 
nationwide banks held nearly 407 billion of outstanding farm 
debt at the end of last year compared with the approximately 394 
billion held by institutions within the farm credit system

ab electrolux of sweden freed by a 
federal judge to pursue a takeover of murray ohio manufacturing 
co moved immediately to raise its bid from 182 million to 197 
million 
ab electrolux a giant appliance maker said monday it was 
boosting its offer for murray ohio by 4 to 52 a share murray 
ohio manufactures lawn mowers and bicycles at a plant in 
lawrenceburg tenn 
murray ohio stock closed at 51125 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange more than double its price last dec 31 
in a letter to murray ohios directors who turned down the 
earlier 182 million offer ab electrolux president anders scharp 
wrote from stockholm we are not hostile outsiders we are as 
familiar as our major brand names frigidaire tappan and eureka in 
american homes and poulan and weedeater in american back yards 
ab electrolux which has no connection with us vacuum cleaner 
manufacturer electrolux inc of marietta ga operates a tappan 
kitchen range plant at springfield tenn north of nashville 
scharp said ab electrolux had no intention to move murray ohios 
production from lawrenceburg nor would it make any economic 
sense for murrays production to be consolidated or transferred to 
our other facilities the letter was made public in new york 
nonetheless murray ohio officials mustered their 3000 
employees at a night meeting in lawrenceburg to discuss the court 
ruling 
after the meeting john l duncan president and chief executive 
officer of murray ohio said he did not know details of ab 
electroluxs increased bid 
we understand that theyre going to make an offer and well 
deal with that when it comes duncan said 
murray ohios lawyers said they would appeal the decision by 
us district judge thomas a wiseman notice was filed to appeal 
wisemans dissolution of a temporary injunction against ab 
electrolux to the 6th us circuit court in cincinnati 
the murray ohio employees and others among the 11000 residents 
of lawrenceburg have formed a just say nej committee to oppose 
the takeover nej is swedish for no 
wiseman ruled after last weeks hearing on murray ohios request 
to block ab electrolux from proceeding with its bid 
i know of no law permitting the court to enjoin the transfer 
of stock we have in this country respect for private property 
he said 
wiseman said he also found absolutely no evidence that 
confidential information on murray ohio was made available to ab 
electrolux by the new york law firm of sullivan amp cromwell which 
once advised murray ohio how to defend itself against a takeover 
all the information appeared in an magazine article that was 
readily available to any professional investigator wiseman said 
in his ruling from the bench 
in new york wisemans ruling prompted sullivan amp cromwells 
john l warden to issue a statement saying we are gratified that 
the courts decision on the evidence confirmed the position we 
have taken since this matter began 
in a statement monday ab electrolux said its tender offer would 
be financed from its working capital and would be subject to 
shareholder approval only if ab electrolux is not satisfied that 
the ohio control share act is inapplicable to the offer 
the ohio control share act is an antitakeover law and the ab 
electrolux statement said it would seek a ruling from federal 
courts in ohio that the act is inapplicable 
murray ohio began in ohio in 1919 manufacturing running boards 
for automobiles when running boards disappeared the company 
switched to wheeled toys moving its headquarters to brentwood

kaisertech ltd the fifthlargest 
aluminum producer in the world will be acquired by maxxam group 
inc for around 725 million 
kaisertech announced monday that it had agreed to be acquired by 
the los angelesbased real estate and lumber company in a merger 
that would pay shareholders 19375 in cash for each share of 
kaisertech common stock 
the agreement under which kaisertech would become a subsidiary 
of maxxam was approved by kaisertechs board of directors at a 
special meeting sunday 
kaisertech stock closed 25 cents lower monday at 17875 a 
share maxxam stock closed unchanged at 13875 
industry analysts predicted that kaisertech which has lost 
money in recent years should do well in 1988 the oaklandbased 
company which is the parent of kaiser aluminum amp chemical corp 
is the thirdlargest aluminum producer in the nation 
kaisertech made money in the first quarter and were looking 
for the first time in the last five or six years the companys 
going to make money from its operations said sean st clair an 
analyst with duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
st clair also noted that aluminum prices have risen and that 
us producers are selling more both in the united states and 
abroad 
the two companies declined to comment on the future of 
kaisertechs current management and staff but analyst thomas van 
leeuwen of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york said the 
companys corporate structure probably would remain intact 
kaisertech received one other bid from a private investment 
group that proposed a leveraged buyout but that company was not 
identified in a leveraged buyout the acquirer finances the 
purchase of the target company with sales of the targets assets or 
from its cash flow 
kaisertech shareholders will vote on the proposed merger at a 
special meeting to be called soon the company said 
kaisertechs lawyers believe that delaware law under which 
kaisertech is incorporated requires an affirmative vote of at 
least twothirds of the shares of common stock not owned by maxxam 
for approval company spokesman robert w irelan said 
earlier this year maxxam acquired 32 percent voting control of 
kaisertechs stock from kaisertech chairman alan clore for about 
224 million maxxam spokesman jim iaco said 
last month kaisertech sued clore and maxxam over a dispute over 
rights to nominate directors but the two companies have agreed to 
ask that the litigation be put on hold irelan said 
maxxam which develops real estate also owns pacific lumber 
co the worlds largest producer of redwood lumber it has 
received widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting of 
oldgrowth redwoods in northern california 
kaisertech operates plants in nine states and seven foreign 
countries it reported losses in five of the past six years mainly 
because the recession of the early 1980s depressed aluminum prices 
st clair said 
but the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices which had 
dropped to 48 cents a pound rose to 106 a pound he said 
kaisertech reported a net loss of 362 million last year 
widened from a loss of 398 million in 1986 revenues were about 
2 billion in both years 
much of the 1987 loss stemmed from the companys restructuring 
last year irelan said 
but in the first quarter of 1988 kaisertech reported net profit 
of 363 million or 73 cents a share on revenue of 5283 
million for the same period in 1987 kaisertech posted a net loss 
of 311 million on revenue of 4942 million

with more than two months left in their 
marketing season washington growers reporte record sales of the 
nations largest apple crop 
through may 20 washington growers shipped 565 million boxes of 
apples compared with the old record of 55 million boxes for all of 
last year according to the wenatchee valley traffic association 
each box weighs 42 pounds 
the shipping figures are good news for an industry trying to 
market a record bumper group but the good news is tempered by 
stagnant prices 
were ahead of where we need to be at this time of year 
said association manager bill dewitt in a telephone interview 
monday 
there is no sign that sales are slackening 
in the past five weeks sales are nearly 40 percent above the 
same period in 1987 according to the washington apple commission 
which spent more than 16 million in television and radio ads over 
the past two months 
this apple crop which represents roughly half the nations 
supermarket supply is easily the largest in state history 
although the estimate has been cut to 674 million boxes from an 
original projection of 72 million boxes because of the loss of poor 
quality fruit during storage dewitt said 
overseas sales are way up this year with 111 million boxes 
shipped to foreign countries through may 20 compared with 52 
million boxes at that time in 1987 dewitt said most shipments are 
to taiwan hong kong singapore thailand and malaysia 
traditionally good customers 
exports are helped by the low prices this year dewitt said 
prices range from 7 a box for washington fancy grade apples to 
10 to 14 a box for washington extra fancy 2 to 3 lower than 
last year dewitt said it can cost about 950 to grow pack and 
ship a box of apples so many of the states 5000 growers are 
still losing money or breaking even 
apples are the states largest cash crop worth 489 million to 
growers in 1986

mccormick amp co inc announced it would end its 
proposed 56 million takeover of a west coast competitor after the 
federal trade commission unanimously voted to challenge the bid in 
court 
mondays announcement effectively ends the hunt valley spice 
makers fourmonth pursuit of regulatory approval for its proposed 
acquisition of the spice islands line of spices herbs and vinegars 
from specialty brands inc of san francisco 
the announcement came just hours after the ftc said it had 
authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction blocking the 
sale because of its potential to substantially reduce competition 
in the production and sales of spices 
as a result of the ftcs obvious opposition mccormick amp 
specialty brands have decided not to pursue the merger mac 
barrett mccormick spokesman told the baltimore sun were 
disappointed 
executives at specialty brands did not return phone calls monday 
the ftc which typically reviews how proposed mergers will 
affect market share barriers to entry and competition in a given 
industry has sought to block only seven proposed mergers in the 
past year said spokeswoman susan ticknor 
the takeover would have given mccormick already the worlds 
largest spice producer the brand name of one of its bestknown 
rivals in the 850 million condiments business 
mccormicks proposed purchase price of 56 million for the west 
coast concern was a considerable premium over spice islands 1987 
sales of 30 million 
when the proposed deal was announced in late january some 
industry analysts speculated that it might raise antitrust 
questions because of mccormicks huge share of the market 
estimated to be more than twice that of durkee its largest 
domestic competitor 
the acquisition of spice islands which holds an estimated 30 
percent of the fastgrowing 100 million gourmet side of the 
business would have given mccormick an 80 percent share of that 
segment industry analysts say 
the ftc is hanging tough on this one because they believe it 
would create too much concentration in a hotly contested business 
everybodys fighting for market share said david s leibowitz 
an analyst who follows mccormick for american securities in new 
york 
others however expressed surprise at the ftcs ardor in 
blocking mccormicks acquisition of a company whose 1987 sales 
totaled only 30 million 
its surprising that the commission would attempt to block a 
transaction that is relatively small compared with all the 
multibillion dollar deals weve seen lately said barry ziegler 
an analyst at tucker anthony amp co in new york it seems like a 
lot of effort over a relatively small matter 
late last month a federal judge granted the ftcs request to 
stop the proposed deal on the grounds that mccormick hadnt 
provided enough information for the agency to determine how the 
transaction would affect competition in the spice and seasonings 
business 
prior to that decision mccormick sued the agency maintaining 
that the company had supplied more than 120000 pages of documents 
and provided the depositions of key executives 
earlier this month mccormick acquiesced to the ftcs demand for 
more information and dropped its suit but monday two days before 
its deadline to render a decision on the merger the ftc said it 
would challenge mccormick in court if it persisted with the 
transaction 
given the length of time that has passed since the proposal 
first was announced and the possible legal battle with federal 
regulators mccormick decided to abandon its bid after the 
months involved in getting us to this point and the ftcs decision 
to oppose the transaction we decided the best course of action is 
to drop the merger barrett said

to memorial southeast hospital for observation said regional 
laboratory manager russell leach 
the chemicals included gasoline crude oil caustic soda 
naphtha acrylonitrile and benzene sybert said there also were 
cylinders of nitrogen argon and helium 
gloria rodriguez was in her home about two blocks from the lab 
when the fire began 
i heard a big boom and fire started shooting up then the

monday mornings blast at the automata inc computer parts factory 
which sprayed caustic chemicals throughout the plant officials

bank of new york co said it has no intention of 
boosting its 11 billion hostile offer for irving bank corp to 
outdo a sweetened bid from italys secondlargest bank 
banca commerciale italiana spa on monday raised its offer for a 
controlling interest in irving to 80 a share or about 760 
million analysts called the increase over the banks previous bid 
of 75 a share significant 
the staterun italian bank said the latest bid which seeks 51 
percent of irvings 185 million common shares outstanding was 
conditional on irving keeping intact the antitakeover poison 
pill it adopted to fend off bank of new york 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said his company had no 
plans to raise its tender offer of 15 in cash and 1575 shares of 
its own stock for each of irvings shares 
bank of new york had proposed to slightly increase the stock 
portion of the 11 billion bid if among other things irving 
agreed to hold friendly talks and dismantle its poison pill 
defense but irvings board of directors unanimously rejected that 
proposal last week 
brady blasted the banca commerciale condition for raising its 
offer as tilting the playing field this time we know they 
reserve the right to walk away whenever they like he said 
banca commerciale said the revised offer would retain a onetime 
dividend of 10 a share which irving had promised shareholders as 
part of a complex restructuring program that includes asset sales 
and costcutting measures 
as the recent modifications of the size of the offer by our 
institution demonstrates bci confirms that it is heavily committed 
to irving banca commerciale chairman enrico braggiotti said in a 
statement from the companys milan headquarters

the newest white house report on the stock 
market collapse does nothing to soothe wall streets problems and 
is merely an effort to prevent legislative action this year the 
chairman of the senate banking committee said today 
the chairman sen william proxmire dwis told the four 
highlevel federal officials who wrote the report that their study 
was pitiful during a hearing on its recommendations 
this working group has been the regulatory equivalent of the 
north carolina tar heels basketball strategy called the 
fourcorners offense proxmire said pass the ball around to 
run out the clock never shoot just stall and run out the clock 
proxmire has been critical of the study since its release may 
16 on monday he said on the senate floor that in the seven months 
since oct 19 the day the dow jones industrial average dropped a 
record 508 points american corporations have raised only 15 
billion during the same period between 1986 and 1987 those 
businesses raised 107 billion he said 
proxmire said the unpredictable fluctuating performance of the 
stock market since october has scared many investors away and made 
it diffcult for companies to raise needed investment money the 
recommendations in the report which was overseen by the treasury 
department did not address that problem proxmire said 
the study was written by treasury undersecretary george d 
gould commodity futures trading commission chairwoman wendy gramm 
securities and exchange commission chairman david s ruder and 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
the reports recommendations have drawn fire on capitol hill 
from lawmakers who have complained that it failed to recommend 
decisive action to deal with the ills of the nations financial 
markets 
it contained no proposals to restrict types of program trading 
the computerdriven transactions some critics have blamed for the 
markets continued volatility it ignored critics who say the 
margins or upfront payments for stock index futures 
transactions on the chicago commodities markets are too low and 
thus encourage speculation that causes wild bounces in prices on 
the market in new york 
in addition it paid no notice to a recommendation by an earlier 
white house task force that one federal agency likely the fed 
be put in charge of all issues that affect the nations stock 
futures and options markets that jurisdiction is now split among 
the fed cftc and sec 
the gould groups most striking recommendation was for an 
hourlong trading halt across all financial markets if the dow ever 
drops by 250 points in a single day a second twohour closing 
would occur if the widelywatched index plummets by 400 points 
the dow has dropped as many as 250 points only once last oct 
19 the working groups members say setting the trigger at such a 
high point would keep it out of the markets normal workings and 
ensure that it comes into play only in emergencies 
the report also recommended changes in the clearing credit and 
settlement mechanisms that the markets use to complete the 
exchanges of money and paperwork that accompany each days 
transactions

when claire scholz started making childrens 
bathtub puppets 10 years ago she thought in terms of thousands 
before long she may be talking millions 
although her company remains tiny consisting of ms scholz and 
two other staffers her trademark tub buddies are getting 
nationwide exposure in newspaper promotions and her success is 
providing production work for two factories in rural south dakota 
and valuable employment opportunities for handicapped workers in 
the state 
one nice thing about our stuff is that it can go into rural 
areas where unemployment is bad said the puppet maker 
ms scholz aleady has received the 1988 governors cup for her 
contributions to special education in south dakota 
they can do a lot more things than we allow them to do ms 
scholz said of handicapped workers theres a lot they can do 
better than people off the street 
she stumbled into the business through contacts she made at a 
new york product show it is very much an industry of who you 
know she said 
her drizzle the dragon for instance is offered as a premium 
for buying a brand of toilet bowl cleaner consumers who send in 
proofofpurchase seals from the product are eligible to buy 
drizzle at a reduced price 
ms scholz is also working on deals to feature puppets with 
chewing gum tea life insurance and spark plugs 
the danger of the premium industry is that its a onetime 
deal she said 
she said cartoonist charles schulz is working on a snoopy design 
to fulfill one companys request another firm wants kermit the 
frog one of the famous muppet characters created by jim henson 
on a recent trip to new york ms scholz toured hensons 
workshop it was south dakota girl goes to heaven she said 
her puppets are good for product premiums because the price is 
right 399 to 599 retail and the quality is high she said 
more and more the awareness is coming back to made in the 
usa products she said 
ms scholz 38 started manufacturing bathtub puppets in 
deadwood sd in 1978 after spending several years traveling the 
country doing street theater with a group called dragons are too 
seldom puppets named after an ogden nash poem 
in 1980 her company now called dragons are too seldom 
inc sold 20000 puppets through individual gift and toy stores 
two years later she got into mass marketing and by 1984 she was 
selling 300000 puppets a year produced by 120 home seamstresses 
in the northern black hills 
half a million tub buddies sold last year and she hopes to 
double that figure in 1988 in addition she produces rubadub 
glubs soft fuzzy bath mitts shaped like a pirate ship or noahs 
ark 
two new products still being developed are expected this 
summer were kind of getting out of the bathtub she hinted 
as the company grows pressures change for ms scholz when no 
bank would lend her money to get started 10 years ago she 
persuaded private investors to take a chance later she obtained a 
small business administration loan now she owns 93 percent of the 
company 
with success has come other problems ms scholz recently won a 
copyright lawsuit in boston against a company that made what she 
calls bad copies of tub buddies 
gone are the home workers replaced at first by a manufacturing 
plant in missouri and later by the south dakota factories 
employing handicapped individuals 
prairie trends a forprofit factory was set up by the huron 
area adjustment training center to produce about 200000 puppets 
this year the 26 people producing the puppets include eight 
handicapped workers who handle packaging and shipping 
if we had more entrepreneurs like claire we would have a lot 
more work for our people said tom meekins executive director of 
the training center a private agency 
in sturgis the black hills special services cooperative has 
been producing ms scholzs creations for three years and will turn 
out 450000 pieces in 1988 the coop is a public agency that 
educates special students from 12 school districts about 50 
percent of the coop factorys workers are handicapped 
one more factory would be nice ms scholz said if the 
business continues to grow

caught between patriotism and protectionism 
officials are reluctantly allowing sales clerks from other 
countries to work behind the counters in singapore department 
stores 
on the one hand officials dont want their booming economy to 
suffer from a lack of labor but they are equally determined not to 
let the country depend indefinitely on lowskilled foreign workers 
no quick solution is in sight 
in announcing the budget recently finance minister richard hu 
noted that a controlled revolving pool of foreign workers on 
shortterm work permits would be allowed to continue beyond 1992 
the demand for foreign workers has been increasing rapidly 
more than half of the 48000 jobs created in the manufacturing 
sector last year were filled by foreign workers in the last three 
months manufacturing companies have been recruiting about 2500 
foreign workers each month hu said 
bolstered by strong overseas demand and foreign investment the 
economy has bounced back from a recession three years ago but a 
limited labor pool in this citystate of 26 million people is now 
regarded as a threat to continued growth 
helpwanted ads cram the newspapers signs offering walkin 
interviews are posted outside dozens of factories with workers 
able to pick and choose jobhopping is common especially in the 
electronics industry 
economic expansion generated a net increase of 66000 new jobs 
last year according to ministry of trade and industry figures the 
economy grew by 88 percent compared to 18 percent in 1986 
unemployment was 28 percent at the end of 1987 against 46 
percent at the beginning of last year 
the boom is exemplified by seagate technology the largest 
single private employer the us diskdrive manufacturer started 
operations here six years ago with 50 workers and now employs 
13000 
the united states decided in january that singapore known along 
with hong kong taiwan and south korea as the fastgrowing four 
dragons of asia is no longer a developing country in need of 
special trade preferences dutyfree access to the us market for 
the exports of all four is to be ended 
established department stores complained earlier this year of a 
shortage of about 2000 sales clerks newlyopened stores were able 
to lure away such personnel from older retailers by offering high 
starting salaries older merchants could not match the money 
because of a wage freeze imposed during the recession they 
appealed for government help 
labor minister lee yock suan told parliament recently that 
laborstarved storekeepers could now hire foreigners providing they 
had the equivalent of a high school education 
one chain of eight stores advertised in neighboring malaysia for 
counter staff so far with indifferent results the malaysian 
economy is also thriving absorbing much of the labor singapore 
stores and factories seek and at least one retailer suggests that 
the educational qualification is too stringent 
until the stores got help alien work permit holders could 
be hired only in construction manufacturing hotels and as 
domestic servants these jobs are often spurned by increasingly 
affluent singaporeans who enjoy the highest standard of living in 
asia after the japanese 
the government once argued that guest workers in these fields 
were manageable because terms of service were clear cut they were 
usually housed in dormitories by their employers and automatically 
sent home when contracts ended it was assumed that retail clerks 
would be scattered throughout the island and might try to remain 
after their contracts expired 
the total work force is 12 million about 40 percent of the 
estimated 140000 foreign laborers are employed as domestic help 
threequarters of the from the philippines 
whitecollar foreigners including executives bankers 
engineers and teachers are classified separately those with 
special skills are being avidly sought 
lee said the policy on foreign workers was already very 
liberal and would not be eased further as a small country 
singapore cannot afford to let the unskilled flow in lee said 
he estimated that for every 1 percent of growth the economy 
needs 10000 foreign workers for 10 percent growth it means 
100000 foreign workers which could not be allowed lee said 
no more than 50 percent of a companys staff can be from outside 
the country to restrain demand further the government collects a 
special tax from employers of foreign workers 
lee suggested that private companies do not try hard enough to 
attract available locals including housewives those willing to 
work parttime and older people 
there are 745799 singaporeans listed as economically inactive 
many of whom left the work force at the traditional retirement age 
of 55 
with sufficient inducements and job opportunities many 
housewives could be attracted back to the labor markets the easy 
way out is for employers to lobby for access to more foreign 
workers lee said 
of particular concern to trade union leaders is a pool of older 
workers who lost relatively wellpaid jobs in the recession and who 
are unsuited to the openings now available or unwilling to accept 
them 
meantime the government acknowledges the labor crunch by 
allowing workers to be recruited from china although singapore has 
no diplomatic ties with beijing and remains rigorously 
anticommunist

call fx matt ii oldfashioned and youre 
likely to get a nod of agreement and a thank you 
thats because oldworld methods and a strong association with 
tradition are what have helped the thirdgeneration beer makers 
business outlast thousands of other breweries and what matt expects 
will carry his company through its second century 
there are some secrets to success and respect for tradition is 
one of them said matt whose grandfather francis xavier matt 
started the company in 1888 as the west end brewing company 
there were some things the founder preached to his son and he to 
me 
my grandfather had a brewing philosophy of making beer the 
right way even if it wasnt the most economical way he felt a 
brewer had to keep faith with the public by making a high quality 
product today we still believe that said matt who like his 
grandfather and father before him tours the brewery daily 
the strength of tradition at the fx matt brewing company can 
be seen in the original turnofthecentury office design that 
reminds employees and visitors alike of the companys 100yearold 
legacy but that doesnt mean time has stood still at the brewery 
my grandfather was fond of saying a business is like a man 
you have to feed him to keep him alive we do things the old way 
but we do it with the most advanced equipment said matt making 
note that the company has spent more than 20 million since 
building one of the countrys first milliondollar brewhouses in 
1948 
matts brewing technique called krausening was carried over 
from germany by fx matt who emigrated to america in 1878 and 
went to work with the bierbauer brewery the following year 
krausening is a process in which newly fermented beer is added into 
a tank of already aging beer to produce a natural carbonation 
because the process adds weeks onto the time required for aging 
beer many companies use chemical additives to accomplish the same 
thing 
before the first matt turned 30 he had taken over bierbauer and 
reorganized it into the west end brewery it was the smallest of 
uticas 12 breweries and one of over 4000 nationwide today 
matts is the 12th largest of about 30 breweries in the united 
states but only a fraction of the size of industry leader 
anheuserbusch inc 
the company continued to grow during the next three decades but 
was nearly ruined in 1919 when the government passed the 
prohibition amendment the brewery survived however tenuously 
by establishing a line of soft drinks fruit beverages syrups 
extracts distilled water and malttonic under the label utica club 
when prohibition was repealed in 1933 the west end brewing co 
was the first beer maker in the nation to obtain a permit to renew 
beer sales one and a half hours after president franklin d 
roosevelt signed the repeal measure into law 
in 1951 91yearold fx matt turned over the company 
presidency to the oldest of his two sons walter who ran the 
company until his son ascended to the top executive position in 
1980 during walters reign while smaller breweries fell victim to 
industry giants the companys production rose to over 500000 
barrels a year 
because the company is privatelyowned and for competitive 
reasons current production levels are not released but matts 
makes eight different kinds of beers including two light beers a 
cream ale and a malt liquor 
but more important than quantity to matt is the taste of his 
product 
the public in this country tends to think of beer as an 
openthehatchthrowitdown beverage i want them to think about 
the taste because if they do ill get some of them as 
customers said matt who laments that most american beer makers 
have steered away from producing beers of distinctive character 
his determination to give beer drinkers a beverage with 
guts as he calls it led to the companys involvement with 
specialty beers including one that competes headon with popular 
european imports 
i was visiting a friend in germany and he had taken me for a 
ride on the autobahn in his mercedesbenz it was a marvelous 
ride recalled matt i said to myself if i were an american 
carmaker i would want to build something this good a car that was 
as good as the best i realized then that i should do that with my 
beer 
the result was saranac 1888 allmalt lager a rich 
highlyhopped bavarianstyle beer that carries a flavor comparable 
to any import unlike most american beers saranac contains no rice 
or corn grain only barley malt and water 
the beer has proven popular so much so that on several 
occasions demand has outrun supply but matt like his grandfather 
did years ago tells distributors they must wait while the beer 
ages properly 
our future lies in the hand of the consumer if they feel our 
products are worthwhile well be around for another 100 years 
he said

the soybean futures market shook off the dampening effects of 
last weekends rains and resumed its dryweather rally tuesday 
with prices on some contracts advancing nearly the 
30centsabushel daily limit 
grain futures also gained on the chicago board of trade 
on other markets copper futures prices fell sharply while 
precious metals were mixed cocoa futures soared livestock and 
meat were mostly lower energy futures were mixed and stockindex 
futures advanced 
mondays steep drop in soybean futures prices was only a 
temporary setback and the weekend rains that caused it were only a 
brief respite from the unusally warm dry conditions that will 
continue to dominate springtime weather in the midwest according 
to tuesdays forecasts 
the meteorologists lowered their forecasts of rain between now 
and next monday and everybody jumped back on the bandwagon said 
jerry gidel an analyst in chicago with gh miller amp co 
the soybean market is especially sensitive to weather factors 
amid dwindling stockpiles and fears of tight supplies if this 
years crop does poorly 
in addition weatherrelated speculative buying the soybean 
complex got a boost from indias purchase of 20000 metric tons of 
us soybean oil and hedgetype buying of soybean meal futures by 
commercial grain processors gidel said 
the grains basically followed the soybeans but corn also 
benefitted from a government report of increased export demand and 
wheat was buoyed by an agriculture department report of dryweather 
damage to the winter wheat crop 
wheat settled 4 cents to 18 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 347 a bushel corn was 4 cents to 5 cents 
higher with july at 219 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents 
higher with july at 175 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 29 
cents higher with july at 783 a bushel 
copper futures prices sank on the commodity exchange in new york 
in response to steady increases in london metal exchange stocks of 
the metal analysts said 
tight supplies have been the main feature of the copper market 
for more than a year and the recent gain of more 12000 tons on 
the london exchange indicates supplies of deliverable copper are 
growing said john oconnell metals analyst with refco inc in new 
york 
the lme is now at 58000 tons thats a big jump he said 
copper settled 22 cents to 41 cents lower with may at 98 cents 
a pound 
gold futures settled slightly lower while silver advanced a bit 
on the commodity exchange 
gold settled 10 cents to 170 lower with june at 46110 a troy 
ounce silver was 15 cents to 16 cents higher with may at 6754 
a troy ounce 
cocoa futures soared to 3month highs on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange 
analysts cited strong technical factors and rumors that the 
brazilian cocoa crop would be poorer than expected 
cocoa settled 35 to 40 higher with july at 1710 per ton 
most cattle futures retreated on the chicago mercantile exchange 
on bearish technical factors and expectations of falling cash 
prices due to slack demand for beef analysts said 
retailers have been very lackluster in terms of buying volume 
to fill their needs for the postmemorial day period and it seems 
like packers are also trying to buy cattle for a little less 
said charles richardson an analyst in denver with lindwaldock amp 
co 
hog futures were mixed while frozen pork bellies retreated in 
reaction to a weaker tone in the cash market richardson said 
live cattle settled 40 cent lower to 05 cent higher with june 
at 7235 cents a pound feeder cattle were 80 cent lower to 10 
cent higher with may at 81 cents a pound hogs were 22 cent lower 
to 20 cent higher with june at 5340 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 25 cent to 40 cent lower with july at 5370 cents a 
pound 
oil futures prices closed mixed in light trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange ahead of the afternoon release of the american 
petroleum institutes weekly inventory figures 
the report showed a buildup of both gasoline and crude oil 
stocks and a drop in supplies of distillates which include heating 
oil 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 5 
cents higher with july at 1740 a barrel heating oil was 20 cent 
to 40 cent higher with june at 4731 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 20 cent to 41 cent higher with june at 5185 cents a 
gallon 
stockindex futures posted substantial gains on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for june delivery of the 
standard amp poors 500 index settled 365 points higher at 25425

the justice department is reviewing claims by 
reuters information service inc that american telephone amp 
telegraph cos plans for a joint venture with telerate inc would 
violate an antitrust court order 
reuters says the venture to offer a foreign exchange 
transactional service would violate the consent decree that broke 
up the bell system which prohibits atampt from entering the 
electronicpublishing business until august 1989 at the earliest 
there is no question that the transactional service 
contemplated by the joint venture constitutes electronic 
publishing within the meaning of the consent decree said a 
letter reuters sent to the justice departments antitrust division 
a copy of the letter was obtained by the associated press 
reuters parent company reuters holdings plc operates an 
electronic foreignexchange service similar to the ventured planned 
by atampt and telerate reuters service allows traders to confer 
electronically using computers said reuters spokesman robert cooke 
cooke said he could not comment on the letter 
a justice department spokesman confirmed the letter dated may 10 
was received but antitrust attorney nancy garrison declined to 
comment the antitrust division enforces the consent decree 
atampt spokeswoman mary ward said the company is in complete 
compliance with the consent decree 
john jessop executive vice president of telerate said the two 
companies plan to develop a service that allows foreign exchange 
traders to trade electronically with each other and thats not 
getting into the information business 
were getting on with our business and we think reuters should 
do the same jessop said were a little surprised that a 
company with a dominant market position in transactional services 
should seek government help in fending off competition 
telerate 56 percent owned by dow jones amp co operates a global 
financial information network 
atampt is the nations largest longdistance company

texaco inc and its largest shareholder gave 
themselves the option of three extra days to negotiate tuesday as 
part of an effort to reach a truce in their feud over the troubled 
oil giants future 
takeover strategist carl c icahn who owns 148 percent of 
texacos stock has threatened a shareholder fight to elect his 
associates to the board at the companys annual meeting next month 
icahn has stated previously that texaco the nations no 3 oil 
company is worth more to shareholders broken up and sold the 
management has pledged to sell at least 5 billion worth of assets 
as part of a profound restructuring plan the two sides have been 
intensely negotiating for the past few weeks 
texaco said late tuesday that to help further discussions it 
and icahn had agreed to a mechanism under which the annual meeting 
could be postponed from june 7 to june 17 both sides had 
previously agreed to postpone the meeting to june 14 if necessary 
so the new arrangement gave them three additional days 
a receptionist at icahns new york office said he was out of the 
office and unreachable for comment 
sources familiar with the texacoicahn negotiations who spoke 
on the condition they not be identified said the option to further 
delay the annual meeting did not necessarily mean there was any 
significant movement in the position of either side there had been 
speculation an agreement was near 
it signifies that each side would like to stop the clock from 
ticking and have three free days without the encumbrance of time 
said one source 
texaco shares which have been falling since the truce talks 
began declined 150 tuesday to 4612 in heavy volume in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
the icahn negotiations are the latest chapter in texacos effort 
to function normally following a protracted legal battle with 
pennzoil co which left texaco mired in bankruptcy court for 
nearly a year

bdm international inc a defense services company for about 425 
million 
in buying bdm ford aerospace will get access to expertise used 
by government defense security and intelligence agencies said

co inc in washington dc 
bdm based in mclean va has participated in projects 
including mobile basing for intercontinental missiles and the 
application of spaceoriented strategic defense technology 
president reagans star wars program 
bdm in turn will benefit from ford aerospaces deep cash 
pockets in competing for government contracts which account for 
more than 90 percent of bdms revenue benson said 
its getting harder for companies to make money in the defense 
business there is severe competition for a pie thats not 
growing he said after years of increased defense spending 
were seeing constraints making it more difficult for these 
defense companies to grow and leading to more acquisitions 
ford aerospace a whollyowned subsidiary of ford motor co 
will pay 3475 apiece for all class a and class b common shares of 
bdm 
bdm was founded in 1959 by drs joseph v braddock bernard j 
dunn and daniel f mcdonald 
the three founders have granted ford aerospace an irrevocable 
option to purchase their class b shares representing 807 percent 
of the voting power of all bdm stock 
the agreement virtually assures that ford will be able to 
complete the acquisition said james hughes bdms general 
counsel 
ford aerospace will begin a tender offer for all bdm common 
shares by may 31 the company said 
this transaction is part of ford aerospaces strategy to 
solidify its base and expand its business in the command control 
communications and intelligence field ford aerospace president 
donald b rassier said 
it is hard to imagine a better fit of talents technologies 
and businesses than ford aerospace and bdm he said 
bdm has 3700 employees at 14 technology centers and 36 other 
offices in the united states and foreign countries it earned 53 
million or 44 cents a share on revenue of 73 million in the 
first quarter of 1988 
in 1987 bdm earned 197 million or 166 a share on revenue 
of 314 million benson said bdm has reported 18 consecutive years 
of increased earnings 
we have been assured a good measure of autonomy and clearly 
the combination is an exciting one in terms of future growth and 
development said earle c williams bdm president and chief 
executive officer 
in 1987 bdm was awarded government contracts worth about 400 
million while ford aerospace garnered government contracts worth 
13 billion ford spokesman eugene koch said 
ford does not release separate earnings data for its 
subsidiaries 
bdm provides professional and technical services in national 
defense and security communications systems integration energy 
logistics space information systems manufacturing technology and

president reagan vetoed a major trade bill for 
the second time in three years tuesday and the house swiftly 
countered by voting to enact the measure over his objections 
i am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our 
economic growth reagan said in focusing his veto message on a 
provision that would require companies to give their employees 
notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
within hours the house voted 308113 to override the veto 
the margin was well above the twothirds majority required but it 
was thought unlikely that the senate would go along when it 
considers the override after next weeks memorial day recess 
sixty house republicans defected from the administration and 
voted to override only one democrat robert mrazek of new york a 
strong advocate of free trade voted to sustain the president 
lawmakers said reagans action represented the launching of a 
major campaign issue 
i happen to think its a better issue for the democrats than 
for the republicans said house speaker jim wright dtexas 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
asked why hand it to us on a silver platter 
democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis wasted no 
time seizing it he called the veto unconscionable 
dukakis said reagan and vice president george bush dont 
understand that for working families who struggle to pay the 
mortgage save for their childrens education and care for their 
elders there is nothing more painful than losing a job 
any administration that is willing to give general manuel 
noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to 
give the american worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out 
on the street dukakis said he referred to a tentative deal to 
drop drug charges against the panamanian strongman if he agrees to 
relinquish power and leave panama by august 
the house approved the measure 312107 on april 21 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva acknowledged that 
the senate would not override the president when it considers the 
veto early next month but he scoffed at reagans request for 
speedy consideration of a strippeddown version of the bill 
a presidential veto can only be overidden if both chambers vote 
to do it by twothirds margins 
in particular reagan objected to the plantclosing requirement 
as well as provisions restricting the export of alaskan oil white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president would sign a 
new bill that deleted both sections 
but byrd warned that it will be extremely difficult for a 
new bill to wend its way through the chambers complex procedures 
before its oct 8 adjournment anybody who thinks that can be 
done in the senate is simply naive he said 
wright speaking with reporters before reagan acted said that 
if democrats cant override reagans veto they would push the 
strongest most effective trade bill that you can but that will 
take time 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas predicted however 
that not only will the veto be sustained in the senate but a 
cleaner version will become law 
theres enough time if the house sends us a trade bill and 
says take it or leave it i think well take it he said 
reagan pledged to work for a new bill saying i am committed 
to enactment of a responsible trade bill this year 
in his conciliatory message to congress he said he acted with 
sincere regret and lauded the members for doing a remarkable 
job during the three years the bill has been under consideration 
unfortunately as the process came to a close provisions were 
included that simply make this bill on balance bad for america 
reagan said 
apparently bowing to the popularity of the plantclosing 
provision and attempting to blunt use of the issue in the coming 
elections the president said he backed voluntary notification of 
layoffs and closings 
it allows the workers the employer the community time to 
adjust to the dislocation it is the humane thing to do he said 
reagan argued that companies need flexibility in announcing 
layoffs or closings in order to survive times of economic stress 
and that he opposed the mandatory provision in the bill he said 
exemptions in the legislation were too ambiguous to be workable 
the president contended the bill would injure an economy that 
has created 16 million new jobs and has the lowest employment rate 
in 14 years 
he also argued that the bill would push the nation in the 
direction of protectionism closing our borders is not the 
solution to opening foreign markets he said 
byrd accused the administration of using the plantclosing 
provision as a smokescreen for its opposition to any trade 
legislation contending it had six years of senate leadership to 
put one through and it never did 
a 6336 senate vote approving the compromise legislation last 
month was short of the twothirds margin needed to override a veto 
suggesting the veto is likely to be sustained in that chamber 
in 1986 congress upheld reagans veto of another major trade 
bill one that would have slapped stiff quotas on textile imports 
on monday reagan cited recent trade statistics showing a 4 
billion improvement in the us merchandise trade deficit between 
february and march as reflecting a genuine boom in exports 
administration officials have cited recent improvements in the 
trade deficit particularly on the export side of the ledger as a 
reason for not enacting restrictive trade measures 
the trade bill is a compromise between separate versions that 
passed both chambers last year a strongly worded house measure 
that called for mandatory retaliation against foreign countries and 
a milder senate version 
in addition to the provisions on plant closings and alaska oil 
the administration opposes provisions to increase some farm 
subsidies expand a program for aiding dislocated workers and 
requiring an unfairtrading investigation of japan for failing to 
open its public works projects to us construction companies 
the white house also opposes sections that call for some 
mandatory retaliation against trading partners and which limit the 
presidents flexibility to act in granting trade relief to us 
industries 
however the administration likes some features of the bill 
including provisions renewing its authority to participate in 
global trade negotiations
