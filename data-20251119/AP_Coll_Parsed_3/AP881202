a 177yearold bottle of french wine sold for 
30525 the buyer hasnt told me what hes going to do with it 
but if he has any sense he will probably drink it said christies 
auctioneer michael broadbent 
the buyer at thursdays auction was a swiss bidding by telephone 
who did not want his name published the seller was peter gerlach 
hansen of vedbaek denmark 
the wine in an old green bottle was a sauterne dated 1811 from 
the chateau yquem vineyards south of bordeaux 
we expected to get over 10000 pounds 18500 for it said 
broadbent 
the 1811 vintage was highly successful in every european wine 
district and as there was a comet that year it is known as the 
comet vintage it is as celebrated as the vintages of 1784 and 1847 
and arguably is the most renowned of all time the auctioneer said 
broadbent said christies had not sold a similar bottle but that 
he had tasted one two years ago 
it had a lovely color with a warm glow and a raisiny bouquet 
full of flavor and life a beautiful drink and a rare experience 
the auctioneer said 
the record price paid for a bottle of wine is 105000 pounds 
then about 150000 for a 1787 chateau lafite red sold dec 5 
1985 the bottle had been initialed for dispatch to thomas 
jefferson but it was never delivered

acting on an optimistic weather 
report nasa decided to try again friday to send atlantis on the 
secret military mission that was scrubbed thursday because of 
violently shifting 104 mph winds in the shuttles flight path 
officials were briefed by weather experts late thursday and 
shortly before midnight workers began refueling the spacecraft for a 
launch friday during a threehour period beginning at 632 am est 
nasa spokesman dick young said the launch management team was 
very upbeat about prospects for friday because the weather 
system that postponed liftoff thursday has left the area 
the upper winds are essentially more benign than they were 
today young said he added that surface winds were expected to be 
an acceptable 10 knots out of the north at the opening of the window 
but would tend to become more marginal at the end of the period 
earlier air force weathermen had said there was a 70 percent 
chance that winds would not interfere again if atlantis could be 
launched soon after sunrise 
should fridays launch have to be scrubbed nasa would have to 
wait until sunday to try again the space agencys policy prohibits 
putting work crews through the hectic launch schedule three days in 
a row 
navy cmdr robert l gibson and his fourman military crew 
dressed in uncomfortable bulky escapet suits had been lying on 
their backs in cabin seats for nearly five hours thursday when the 
decision was made to scrub 
they took it in stride so did the rest of the team said 
launch director bob sieck weve been talking about the threat of 
this so it came as no surprise 
the astronauts themselves were not heard from publicly because 
nasa operating under strict air force secrecy requirements did not 
carry the usual shuttletolaunch control conversations over its 
radio circuit 
using all the resources at its command highaltitude weather 
balloons radar and a shuttle pilot flying through the clouds 
nasa continuously sampled the weather before finally calling it 
quits 
we were watching the weather all the way and finally scrubbed 
due to the winds aloft sieck said there was no hope we were 
going to get out of the situation 
rain had left the area and skies had begun clearing but eight 
miles above the atlantic ocean winds exceeded hurricane force 
lawrence b williams a nasa engineer said the blasts were so 
powerful and erratic that the shuttles computer could not be 
programmed to safely adjust its flight path 
such winds could cause serious damage to the shuttles wings 
col john madura an air force weatherman said the storm front 
that caused the problems would be offshore friday but could be 
followed by strong ground winds that might affect a launch 
sources said the countdown blacked out publicly for security 
reasons had been held twice for onehour periods it was allowed to 
proceed to the nineminutetolaunch mark so that quick advantage 
could be taken of a break in the weather 
none came 
after the scrub technicians immediately started draining the 
halfmillion gallons of supercold fuel that feed the shuttles three 
main engines 
nasas practice is to go through the loading and unloading cycle 
only twice in a 48hour period then calling a twoday break to give 
technicians a rest so if weather interfered again with a fueled 
shuttle on friday the liftoff would be delayed at least until 
sunday 
the scrub extended gibsons unenviable shuttle record for suiting 
up and getting ready to fly only to be disappointed as commander 
of the 24th space shuttle mission he had boarded his ship 
columbia six times before it finally made the flight 
nasa had known for days that bad weather was expected at this 
seaside space port thursday morning but it gambled on beating the 
oneinfive odds that weathermen gave for acceptable conditions the 
scrub cost of fuelingdrainingrefueling of having ships waiting to 
retrieve the booster rockets and a myriad of other launch activities 
has been estimated at 250000 
atlantis mission is only the second since the challenger 
explosion on jan 28 1986 that killed seven astronauts 
though neither nasa nor the air force will discuss the caro 
sources said the shuttle is to launch a 500 million spy satellite 
called lacrosse the sources said the satellite carries a powerful 
new radar that is able to penetrate clouds and gather images of 
military targets in eastern europe and the soviet union lacrosse is 
expected to act as the radar eye in the sky for the new b2 
stealth bomber

many of the bars cafes and hotels where fidel 
castro lived and plotted his successful invasion of cuba three 
decades ago are gone but a few people still remember the bearded 
revolutionary or think they do 
castro lived here for 18 months as an exile but where he took 
his meals and hung out are questions that only he or maybe his 
younger brother raul can say for certain 
castro returned to mexico city on wednesday for the first time in 
32 years this time for thursdays inauguration of carlos salinas de 
gortari it was clear he had fond memories as he strode off his 
plane to a redcarpet welcome and saluted the crowd jovially 
this is my second homeland im thrilled to be back said 
castro 61 
when he first arrived here on july 8 1955 castro was an almost 
penniless young lawyer his sister lidia had to sell her 
refrigerator to raise money for the trip from havana 
fidel and his brother raul had just spent almost two years in a 
cuban prison for leading an unsuccessful but now legendary attack on 
the moncada barracks in a first effort to overthrow dictator 
fulgencio batista 
the brothers quickly set to work organizing a network of cuban 
exiles into a secret invading force they lived as inconspicuously 
as possible although the cuban embassy naval attache did take 
notice and made several inquiries about them with mexican 
authorities 
they werent important people and there were a lot of exiles 
here in those days so there was no reason for anyone to take much 
notice of them said a retired military officer who worked in 
security for a time he asked to remain anonymous 
one of the few who remembers castro is filiberto clemente the 
cashier at the bar latino a block from the interamerican regional 
labor organization 
they used to sit there clemente 52 said in a recent 
interview pointing to a corner table i was very young then a 
sort of waiters helper 
castro fidel i mean used to eat spanish food he drank 
little cognac sometimes and also manzanilla a sherrylike 
spanish drink clemente said he used to live a few blocks from 
here at the hotel oxford 
at hotel oxfords seedy bar a whitehaired barkeeper in her 
mid60s also said she remembered castro 
he used to come here often because a lot of cuban girls were 
living here at the time but he did not live here said the woman 
who refused to give her name 
he lived around the corner at the hotel mariscala which used 
to be known before as la casa de la zorra she added the hotel 
mariscala is gone 
castro is supposed to have had breakfast often at the cafe 
habana around the corner from a gym where the conspirators worked 
out daily 
the habana still stands on the corner of morelos avenue and 
bucarelli street but the last owner and the old cook both died 
recently 
at the labor organization castro used to chat with other latin 
american exiles among them luis alberto monge the organizations 
general secretary and romulo betancourt monge later became as 
president of costa rica and betancourt of venezuela 
as his movement grew to about 60 fighters castro split them into 
secret cells of 10 each and moved them to separate safehouses 
among those castro enlisted was alberto bayo a cubanborn 
officer who fought with the republican army during the spanish civil 
war 
in his memoirs bravo wrote the cubans trained by jogging along 
insurgentes avenue mexico citys main northsouth thoroughfare and 
by climbing iztaccihuatl and popocatepetl two volcanoes to the 
southeast 
the cubans moved to a rundown ranch near chalco a town 21 miles 
southeast of the capital and continued training while disguised as 
workmen 
on june 20 1956 castro and two of his men were arrested and on 
july 2 police raided the ranch and arrested a dozen fighters they 
were released with help from former mexican president lazaro 
cardenas a leftist sympathizer and a power in mexican politics 
cardenas was the father of cuauhtemoc cardenas the man salinas 
beat in a disputed election july 6 many mexican leftists feel 
castro is lending support to an illegitimate government by attending 
the salinas inauguration 
castro and his men ended up on the yucatan peninsula 122 miles 
from cuba where they bought a battered 38foot yacht the granma 
from an american named robert b erickson 
the small band of cubans repaired the boat and set off on a 
stormy nineday trip to cuba and into history on nov 16 1956 a 
25month guerrilla war followed until batista fled and castro 
seized power on jan 1 1959

michael ricci was incredulous when a 
policeman slapped his son with a 1000 parking ticket for illegal 
parking in front of the family home 
i flipped ricci a retired policeman himself said recently 
but neither he nor others ticketed under a new ordinance are 
getting sympathy from officials in this suburban philadelphia 
township where an ordinance passed sept 13 specifies the fine 
and court costs of 23 in an effort to keep narrow culdesacs 
clear for emergency vehicles 
if a fire engine cannot get in there because of the way cars 
are parked there is a danger to the lives of the people said 
township solicitor thomas del ricci when you consider the value 
of human life i dont think 1000 is unreasonable 
riccis 25yearold son ken was tightening battery cables under 
the hood when an officer approached him nov 22 moments later he 
was showing his father the citation 
the elder ricci who retired to horsham from philadelphia 
because i wanted peace and tranquility has company in his 
disbelief 
we were astounded said tom cowgill an insurance agent who 
was ticketed that same night when he and his wife betty were 
visiting their grandchildreni thought it was ridiculous but talk 
to my wife and youll hear a different story they were scraping her 
off the wall 
at least 11 car owners have received thousanddollar tickets so 
far 
del ricci said judges have discretion to suspend part of the 
fine but district justice richard m price who expects to be 
hearing the cases said the way the ordinance was written requires 
him to assess the full 1000 
the first court hearings are scheduled for the end of december 
but price said he expects the township council which meets tuesday 
to change the ordinance and give him some flexibility 
i hope this comes out as funny as it seems said cowgill 
because im not going to pay that 1000 you might have to visit 
me in jail at christmas

former president chun doohwan spends 
his days in exile in an isolated buddhist temple living the way his 
ancestors might have sleeping on a mat reading by candlelight 
chopping wood for heat and praying 
while many koreans are riveted by televised parliamentary 
hearings probing corruption and human rights abuses under his 
presidency chun passes his days in the timeless pattern of buddhist 
monks sharing a solitude that is centuries old 
in the isolated 14th century temple chun and his wife sought as 
refuge there is no television no telephone and the toilet is a 
temporary latrine set up outside his room 
i made a great mistake chun was quoted as telling monks at 
paektamsa mountain retreat five hours drive east of seoul i 
hope that future generations learn a lesson and do not repeat the 
same mistakes 
the former president left seoul to go into internal exile nov 23 
after apologizing to the nation on national television for abuses of 
power dissatisfied dissidents and students have staged mass 
protests demanding his arrest and return to seoul for punishment 
rural exile is a traditional form of repentance for disgraced 
korean officials president roh taewoo hopes chuns banishment will 
persuade koreans to forgive the former general who took power with 
military backing in 1980 
chun has denied any personal wrongdoing but took moral 
responsibility for widespread corruption and abuses under his tough 
rule many koreans detest the man who ruled with an iron fist for 
more than seven years 
the temple is in a northeast region called sorak or snow 
hills a tourist idyll of picturesque mountains forests 
waterfalls and deep ravines there temples such as paektamsa have 
sheltered many political refugees in koreas turbulent 5000year 
history 
makeshift guard posts for chuns bodyguards and about 200 
security police dot the perimeter of the grounds police increased 
security after several dozen radical students tried to storm the 
gate 
head monk kim dokong said he did not know the former president 
was coming until a few hours before his arrival kim said he has 
been told his guests want to avoid contact with outsiders and with 
few exceptions they have 
chun and his wife talked with reporters the day they arrived but 
since have kept to themselves and have not left the temple grounds 
a daughter her husband and several friends have visited 
korean reporters say visitors usually arrive with faces covered 
to hide their identity 
meals cooked by the monks are vegetarian dishes such as boiled 
rice soybean soup sesame leaves and the spicy pickled korean 
cabbage called kimchi 
reading is by candlelight chun reportedly has at least 15 books 
in his room including some on buddhism and one called leadership 
and politics in korea 
he was seen in fur cap and parka chopping wood for fuel 
temperatures in the mountains have been below freezing and heavy 
snowfalls in january and february usually cut off paektamsa 
monks at the temple rise before dawn and say 430 am prayers 
kneeling before a statue of buddha they say chun and his wife lee 
soonja have joined them 
the monks say chun told them he sleeps peacefully without 
insomnia and appreciates the time to walk in the wooded grounds 
reporters given a tour of the chun quarters said the bare 
71squarefeet room is a traditional temple accommodation for guests 
with a small mahogany table and korean floor bedding two black 
leather cushions and a small vinyl dresser were added specially for 
the chuns 
three white towels and a set of winter underwear hung from a 
string on the wall the korea times said and some cosmetics were on 
the dresser 
while chun stays in rural isolation a major drive is underway in 
seoul to expunge him from the nations life and even its history 
books 
in the last week chun has resigned formally from the ruling 
democatic justice party which he founded in 1981 and the ministry 
of education announced his photographs and some material lauding 
achievements of his government would be deleted from school 
textbooks

the reagan administration has ordered all 
american military officers out of the united nations unit that 
patrols southern lebanon saying the risk to us soldiers has risen 
too high despite their affiliation with the international 
peacekeeping group 
the decision disclosed thursday by senior administration 
officials who asked not to be named was attributed to a recent 
internal review that concluded the risk to us soldiers had 
simply grown too great 
the situation inside lebanon is not improving and wearing a 
un badge doesnt mean anything said one source 
the administrations decision affects a unit known as the 
observer group lebanon of the un truce supervision organization 
or untso 
it was not immediately clear thursday whether any single recent 
development in lebanon had prompted the withdrawal order two 
officials insisted not saying the order stemmed from a 
comprehensive review of the situation that was just completed 
nine months ago a us marine officer assigned to the group was 
kidnapped marine lt col william r higgins at the time the 
senior american officer assigned to the group disappeared last feb 
17 while driving on a coastal road between the lebanese city of tyre 
and the border town of naqoura 
he became the ninth american to be seized as a hostage in 
lebanon all apparently by proiranian moslem fundamentalists 
the administration sources said thursday the americans assigned 
to observer group lebanon were ordered out over the past week 
they are no longer in southern lebanon said one source 
theyve been withdrawn over the last several days 
its too risky said another official the risk to our 
people is now considered too high and we dont want them traveling 
inside lebanon 
untso has an authorized strength of 299 military personnel who 
are drawn from 17 nations the united states and the soviet union 
each provide 36 men of the 36 americans assigned to untso 16 have 
normally been assigned to the observer group lebanon 
neither the defense department nor the state department would 
discuss the matter publicly thursday 
the sources said however the decision had been coordinated 
between the two departments and the white house and that the united 
states had informed the united nations it hoped to resume 
participation in the observer group lebanon when conditions in 
southern lebanon permit 
the administration also made clear it would continue to support 
all other un operations in the region the sources said 
untso was organized to observe and maintain the ceasefire 
ordered by the un security council in july 1948 following israels 
creation and supervise the general armistice agreements between 
jordan syria egypt lebanon and israel 
it serves as the focal point for all un middle east 
peacekeeping operations and monitors ceasefire violations along the 
israeli borders 
the united states has quietly reduced the number of americans 
actually patrolling with the un unit inside lebanon since higgins 
kidnapping 
but the administration had adamantly denied having any plans to 
withdraw american soldiers from the team entirely stressing the 
need to demonstrate us support for the peacekeeping efforts 
a third source noted that under normal rotation procedures an 
american would be expected to assume command of observer group 
lebanon in january and that timetable might have played a role 
the state department in response to the continuing civil strife 
in lebanon and the fighting between christians and moslems long ago 
ordered all american civilians out of lebanon and trimmed the staff 
of the us embassy in beirut only between 10 and 30 people now are 
assigned to the embassy officials say

to several major defense contractors

lyndon larouches rent for two residences 
was paid by a publishing company that considered the perennial 
presidential candidate its prime asset according to testimony 
at his tax fraud trial 
marielle kronberg former chief operating officer of the 
publishing house told jurors thursday that she made the payments as 
an expression of gratitude for the firms bestselling author not 
as a substitute for taxable royalties 
the prosecution contends that the rent payments should have been 
declared as taxable income along with household and personal 
services purchased for larouche by his organizations over the last 
decade 
the political eccentric is charged with conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by failing to declare personal financial 
assistance as income and by failing to file income tax returns 
beginning in 1979 
in addition larouche and six associates are charged with 
conspiring to defraud people who lent larouche organizations some 
30 million by intentionally failing to repay the bulk of the money 
two other witnesses told jurors in us district court on 
thursday that larouche was waited upon handandfoot by employees 
who cooked for him his wife and his dogs bought his clothes 
cleaned his house and performed concerts for him 
before the twoweekold trial recessed until monday ms kronberg 
identified a 900 rent check for a residence used by larouche in 
michigan in 1980 and a 5100 rent check for an apartment he used 
in new york city the next year 
the checks came from the new benjamin franklin publishing co in 
new york city ms kronberg said larouche was not involved in the 
companys operation 
the indictment identifies the firm as a company established 
ostensibly for the purpose of publishing the work of larouche 
and members of his political movement 
asked by assistant us attorney kent robinson why she made the 
rent payments ms kronberg said because he was our principal 
author and in that sense our prime asset 
i didnt think it was in lieu of paying royalties to 
larouche she testified adding that many others also used the new 
york apartment 
ms kronberg said the publishing firm did write checks to 
larouche totaling 6000 for royalty payments but said she learned 
they were never cashed 
the indictment says larouche signed a 1980 federal tax return 
showing 7963 in taxable income including the 6000 in uncashed 
royalty checks but the return was never filed 
another witness pam cowdery testified that she played the 
violin and sang at larouches leesburg va estate when he and his 
wife just wanted to hear some music 
the former employee of a larouche graphic company also said she 
cooked for the larouches helped clean the house and even prepared 
very special meals of boned chicken breasts for the couples 
dogs 
larouches security chief richard magraw testified that 
larouche carried no money and said he would buy suits underwear 
tobacco and even haircuts for his balding boss from a security 
fund 
magraw testified under a grant of limited immunity from 
prosecution 
on trial with larouche are his chief fundraiser william wertz 
his legal adviser edward spannaus and four fundraisers michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein

a congressmans son who was running for office 
in illinois while on the payroll of the district of columbias 
delegate to congress says his house job consisted of little more 
than stuffing envelopes on a parttime basis 
thomas john savages job came under scrutiny after the associated 
press reported tuesday that he claimed residency in chicago and was 
running for an illinois house seat while on the payroll of del 
walter fauntroy the districts nonvoting delegate to congress 
savage son of rep gus savage dill earned 21398 while on 
fauntroys payroll between september 1987 and june 1988 
in order to run for state representative in illinois he had 
filed a sworn statement declaring that he had lived continuously for 
two years in the district he sought to represent 
house rules meanwhile say employees may work only in the 
members office or district in fauntroys case the nations 
capital 
when the issue was raised fauntroy said savage worked diligently 
on behalf of a bill that would have granted statehood to the 
district but on thursday savage told the washington post that he 
did no work on statehood and only showed up for work on a parttime 
basis 
we didnt call out much on statehood issues savage told 
the post he said he spent most of his time at work putting 
packages of statehood material together and getting them out 
the rest of the time savage said he spent working around the 
hill occasionally attending a hearing or dropping by the house 
district of columbia offices 
fauntroy was not immediately available to comment on the apparent 
contradiction between his and savages assessment of savages job 
duties 
the latest disagreement followed statements by savage that he had 
lobbied congressmen on the statehood effort fauntroy had said 
savage had been working with grassroots organizers 
fauntroy also said savage used house district of columbia 
committee offices and phones to do his lobbying work but capitol 
hill staffers said thursday that savage did not use their offices 
city officials active in the statehood movement said they had never 
met or heard of him 
dc council chairman david clarke and council members hilda 
mason and betty ann kane all three of whom are active on statehood 
issues said they did not remember meeting savage 
others have placed savage in chicago at the time he was on 
fauntroys payroll and living in washington 
house rules require employees to regularly report to work in the 
members capitol hill or district offices illinois election laws 
require candidates to live continuously for two years in the 
district they intend to represent savage signed an affidavit three 
months after he went to work for fauntroy verifying his residency in

the defense department severed the electronic 
links between two of its computer networks this week after an 
unknown hacker gained entry to a contractors computer the 
pentagon said 
neither of the computer networks involved handled classified data 
or information but the links between the two were temporarily 
severed in order to provide a barrier to protect users the 
department said thursday 
the connections between the arpanet network which links academic 
and corporate computer centers and the socalled milnet system 
which links thousands of military computers were severed monday 
the pentagon said the connection was broken after an 
unidentified hacker penetrated a vax computer belonging to a defense 
contractor on the night of nov 2728 1988 
the hacker used a weakness in the end users computer software 
the fix for this problem has been developed by the vendor and is 
available electronically to users of the software the pentagon 
said 
the pentagon did not identify the contractor but a spokeswoman 
for the mitre corp in bedford mass marcia cohen said one of the 
companys computers had been entered 
arpanet is the same unclassified computer network that was 
crippled last month when someone slipped a virus into the system 
an incident that is being investigated by a federal grand jury in 
syracuse

police said they were investigating whether 
steel rods found near railway tracks caused a train crash that 
killed the wives of the jersey city and cuzco mayors and injured the 
politicians 
a railway car carrying the couples careened off tracks in the 
andes and tumbled down a ravine thursday 
officials of the state railroad company enafer and police said 
steel rods were found near the derailment site police said they 
were looking into reports someone might have planted the rods to 
cause an accident during a daylong nationwide strike thursday 
they said the likely target was a passenger train that was behind 
the tourist train which was making an unscheduled trip 
mayor anthony cucci of jersey city nj and mayor carlos chacon 
of cuzco their wives and six other people were on an outing to the 
inca citadel of machu picchu when the crash occurred thursday 
officials said 
authorities said anna cucci about 60 and doris chacon 58 died 
in the 330 pm crash 
the suvivors were treated at cuzcos regional hospital 
dr luis garcia hospital director said cucci 66 was suffering 
from multiple bruises but was in stable condition and appeared to be 
out of danger 
garcia said chacon was in serious condition with multiple 
fractures and internal bleeding chacon underwent surgery late 
thursday the hospital said 
jersey city councilman jaime vasquez who was also on board told 
reporters he suffered minor injuries 
the cuccis arrived in cuzco on thursday morning and planned to 
participate in a sister city celebration honoring jersy city and 
cuzco vasquez said 
officials said the conditions of the five other people in the car 
were not immediately available but they were not believed to have 
been seriously injured 
the vehicle a modified version of an 11passenger bus outfitted 
for rail travel crashed about six miles outside cuzco a tourist 
area 355 miles southeast of lima police said 
the rail car had left cuzco about 245 pm on a specially 
scheduled trip to machu picchu 60 miles northwest of cuzco 
police said the vehicle derailed and traveled about 30 feet along 
the tracks before going over a hill and tumbling 250 feet down a 
ravine 
some passengers apparently were able to escape before the car 
began rolling garcia said preliminary indications were that the 
women died of skull fractures 
they said the likely target of possible sabotage was a passenger 
train that uses the same tracks to carry residents between cuzco and 
quillabamba 20 miles beyond machu picchu 
that passenger train left the cuzco station shortly after the 
tourist car officials said 
in an effort to paralyze business activity strikers thursday 
blocked a mountain road between the cities with logs and rocks 
officials said adding possible saboteurs might have wanted to 
completely severe transportation by derailing the passenger train 
machu picchu is a citadel hidden on a jungle mountaintop 
in june 1986 a bomb exploded on a train headed for machu picchu 
eight people including an american were killed guerrillas of the 
maoist shining path were suspected of planting the bomb

inaugural day protests in congress and in the 
streets of this restive capital marred the beginning of president 
carlos salinas de gortaris sixyear term 
salinas promising political and economic reforms said thursday 
in his inaugural speech to congress that my administration will 
respond to the citizens demand for respect for political 
plurality and effective participation 
salinas july 6 presidential victory the narrowest in the 
59year history of the governing institutional revolutionary party 
or pri has been clouded by allegations the election was fraught 
with fraud and votetampering 
defying heavy deployment of army troops police and plainclothes 
security guards thousands who claim the pri deprived cuauhtemoc 
cardenas of victory in the election held scattered demonstrations 
unlike previous demonstrations many protesters carried sharpened 
sticks 
police used tear gas to break up a demonstration by 1500 people 
in zocalo plaza outside the national palace where salinas went 
after the inauguration about 150 people including some police and 
soldiers were injured but none were hospitalized red cross 
paramedic carlos daniel ramirez said 
as salinas spoke a crowd of several thousand threw rocks at 
police outside the legislative palace several demonstrators and 
policemen were reported injured 
one police department employee said there were many arrests 
but police spokesmen refused to give figures 
a crowd of 6000 marched about 1 miles cheering cardenas who 
defeated salinas in populous mexico city but finished second 
nationally to the president 
according to the official tally salinas won just over 50 percent 
of the vote with cardenas getting 31 percent and manuel clouthier 
of the conservative national action party a distant third with 17 
percent 
it falls to us to create the conditions so that this government 
leaves the national palace and that it is occupied by the 
people cardenas told the crowd 
cardenas supporters occupied at least 19 city halls in his home 
state of michoacan last week to demand the ouster of the michoacan 
governor and staged protests outside 20 others 
protesters outside the legislative palace said police removed 200 
to 300 people early thursday and left them outside city limits 
alberta torres sanchez 75 claimed police put her on a bus to 
puebla 65 miles southeast of the capital she said she took another 
bus back to rejoin demonstrators 
just before salinas 40 was sworn in about 140 congressmen from 
the four parties making up cardenas national democratic front 
walked out 
only the vote can legitimize him shouted one congressman as 
the group filed out 
the congressional delegation of the conservative national action 
party which has not recognized salinas victory but says he can 
redeem himself by performing well in office remained through the 
speech 
at the end of his speech however the delegation of 40 raised 
signs telling salinas to show with actions your pledge to 
democracy 
under an agreement with the pri leaders of the two opposition 
blocs were allowed to make televised preinaugural speeches critical 
of salinas election in return for a promise not to interrupt the 
ceremony 
i take office in a complex hour between collective hope and 
the weight of accumulated sacrifices between the need for building 
for the future and the pressure for immediate accomplishments 
salinas said it is a singular moment in our history heavy with 
risks but rich in opportunity 
six years of austerity under a program salinas designed as budget 
secretary under miguel de la madrid cut workers buying power by 
more than half it combined with years of slowly mounting discontent 
with government corruption and elections where the result was a 
foregone conclusion victory for the pri 
to recover the economic initiative salinas said he had given 
orders to treasury secretary pedro aspe to begin negotiating new 
terms with international banks on its 102 billion foreign debt 
second highest in the developing world behind brazil 
us secretary of state george p shultz who represented the 
united states applauded salinas address 
here was a man who loved his country with a passion and has a 
clear understanding of the opportunities and the problems ahead and 
is ready to roll up his sleeves and go to work shultz said after 
meeting with salinas

him up and down the street from the strand to chandos place and into

chickens because they didnt know where he was going to go next

shouts from thousands of angry demonstrators 
drowned out the cheers of the few supporters who greeted carlos 
salinas de gortari on his presidential inauguration 
even uniformed police and army soldiers outnumbered the handful 
of citizens who showed up thursday along the inaugural parade route 
to welcome president salinas 
the protesters claim salinas of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party stole the presidency in a july 6 fraudtainted 
election from cuauhtemoc cardenas leader of the national democratic 
front an organization of four leftist parties 
we know that in this country an electoral fraud was committed 
and today an illegitimate presidency has been consummated 
cardenas told 6000 people who gathered for the afternoon march the 
largest protest of the day 
cardenas urged his supporters to avoid violence and organize to 
work for fair elections and nationwide democracy 
before dawn authorities removed protesters from the plaza in 
front of the legislative palace site of the inauguration and 
bussed 200 to 300 of them out of the city demonstrators said 
most were back within hours for a demonstration at the zocalo 
mexico citys central plaza where police used tear gas to disperse 
them again 
a police blockade around the legislative chamber failed to 
prevent angry protesters from throwing rocks at the building during 
the ceremony 
protesters then gathered at independence monument for what was 
planned as a silent protest but was marked by drumbeats catcalls 
at security forces and shouts of death to salinas 
many marchers carried sticks others wore black bows to mourn 
what they called the death of democracy

woody guthries songs rang out in a packed 
theater at a longdelayed tribute to the composer of this land is 
your land in his hometown where some still maintain the 
folksinging great was no folk hero 
about 50 schoolchildren and adult accompanists thursday sang and 
played fiddle guitar banjo harmonica and piano in okemahs 
450seat crystal theater as the audience whistled and clapped along 
i sat there with chill bumps and with tears said guthries 
65yearold sister mary jo edgmon who represented the guthrie 
family his singer son arlo did not attend the tribute just a few 
blocks from the overgrown lot where the guthrie familys house once 
stood 
shows honoring the dust bowl balladeer who died in 1967 
have been held in such grand auditoriums as carnegie hall but 
thursdays was the first in okemah because people like city 
councilman bart webb think guthrie was more of a subversive than a 
star 
webb seething over the first of three tribute performances said 
he would ask the council monday to paint over the home of woody 
guthrie sign painted on one of the central oklahoma towns three 
water towers facing interstate 40 
the ramshackle house where guthries family lived before he left 
okemah at age 17 had been vandalized some of the graffiti scrawled 
on the building called him a communist a label his family rejects 
when the house started falling down local officials did nothing 
leaders of this community of 3300 also once opposed a move to 
proclaim a national woody guthrie day 
mrs edgmon a resident of seminole about 75 miles southwest of 
here bristled at any suggestion her brother lacked patriotism 
saying he championed the downtrodden and jabbed the welltodo 
if youd read what woody wrote youd know how he felt she 
said 
guthries this land is your land has become a patriotic 
standard frequently played at political rallies 
his songs provided a mournful but optimistic rhythm for america 
as it endured the dust bowl and the great depression 
among the 1000 songs he wrote from 1932 to 1952 were classics 
like oklahoma hills and this train is bound for glory the 
1976 motion picture bound for glory chronicled his vagabond life 
guthrie stricken with the degenerative brain disease 
huntingtons chorea had indicated he wanted okemah to be his final 
resting place the town 72 miles east of oklahoma city is a quiet 
agricultural town surrounded by cattlegrazing land dotted with oil 
wells 
but when guthrie died in 1967 at age 55 his ashes were scattered 
over the atlantic ocean 
the okemah tribute was put together by musician larry long 37 
of minneapolis who got a hug from mrs edgmon after thursdays 
concert 
he could double for woody she said smiling and crying it 
took somebody to come in and put it together 
some of the songs performed at the crystal theater were composed 
by youngsters under longs tutelage the tunes were faithful to 
guthries credo read by young narrator jerry baker im out to 
write songs thatll make you take pride in yourself 
long said the performance recorded both for an album and by a 
crew from nbcs today show should help guthries memory burn 
a little brighter 
ive been to tributes from carnegie hall in new york to beverly 
hills mrs edgmon said none of them can top this were 
instilling a positive woody guthrie in the minds of these little 
ones and theyre going to be his fans

bride selling is still prevalent in poorer areas 
of rural china and more must be done to stop the practice according 
to a womens organization quoted in todays official china daily 
the allchina womens federation said the selling of young women 
as brides common in precommunist china still takes place in 
inland provinces such as anhui sichuan and yunnan where economies 
are less developed and education levels are lower the china daily 
reported 
it said some farmers have given up their land to go into the 
business of abducting and selling brides some have lured women away 
from villages with the promise of jobs 
in one county of coastal shandong province more than 3200 
women including farmers factory workers and a postgraduate have 
been sold in the past few years the federation was quoted as saying

crop failures and famine will become more 
widespread unless action is taken immediately to curb emission of 
greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and tropical rain 
forests a report said today 
the delicate balance of gases in the atmosphere is changing 
the economist intelligence unit said in its annual report on food 
and beverage trends this is leading to significant changes in 
global weather patterns and hence in crop yield patterns 
this years drought in the united states which reduced the 
cushion of stocks against poor grain crops next year was one of 
several climatic anomalies in 1988 the report said 
another drought would reduce stocks to dangerously low

women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by 
regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives but 
calcium supplements taken after menopause probably wont be 
effective researchers say 
in a study in todays journal of the american medical 
association researchers said the key factors in bone density among 
postmenopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally 
occurring hormone estrone 
moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do 
not appear to prevent osteoporosis a frequently debilitating 
disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner 
and more brittle they found 
swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not 
going to make your bones thicker said dr lewis kuller of the 
epidemiology department at the university of pittsburghs school of 
public health 
kuller a coauthor of the study involving 174 healthy 
postmenopausal women over a fouryear period also said there is 
no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their 
bone density 
the most important message is that an adequate calcium 
intake during childhood adolescence postadolescence and the 
reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health 
and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis he 
said 
osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to 
bone fractures and spinal problems like dowagers hump some 
estimates project that by age 70 onequarter of the women in north 
america will have suffered a fracture related to the disease 
kuller and his colleagues examined the relationship between bone 
density and dietary calcium intake calcium supplement use and blood 
levels of estrone the primary sex steroid hormone in women after 
menopause estrone is a component of estrogen a hormone combination 
the study found that estrone was also a key factor in maintaining 
bone density a positive relationship that was not affected by 
age time since menopause and the degree of obesity as well as 
other potential bone determinants 
the researchers found that women who reported diets high in 
calcium throughout their lives showed higher bone density however 
observing little impact from use of calcium supplements after 
menopause the researchers concluded 
in our analysis the only group in which a protective effect of 
calcium could be observed was in women who reported both a high milk 
consumption during periods of growth and development as well as 
currently 
kuller said the jury is still out on other methods of increasing 
bone density and reducing fractures but that estrogen therapy in 
postmenopausal women probably reduces osteoporosis 
the study sounds like a reasonable observation supporting 
whats either been partly known or widely suspected dr murray 
favus director of the bone program at the university of chicagos 
pritzker school of medicine said thursday 
several recent studies have shown either no impact or minimal 
impact of calcium supplements on bone density and the role of 
estrone has been shown to be important he said 
most of those in the field now really question whether calcium 
supplements taken after menopause are useful favus said

more news organizations have 
protested a defense department demand that they surrender their film 
of the launch of the space shuttle atlantis in the event of an 
accident 
some organizations removed their remote cameras from the area of 
the launch pad where the flight of the atlantis was postponed 
thursday for at least 24 hours because of poor weather other news 
organizations accepted the requirement but under protest 
after air force officers disclosed the new policy wednesday the 
associated press the new york times and newsweek magazine refused 
to sign the agreement and were denied permission to place remote 
cameras at the launch site the ap described the arrangement as 
military censorship 
later wednesday the florida timesunion withdrew its agreement 
and its cameras gannett news service did the same thursday after 
the launch was postponed 
the remote cameras focused on the base of the launch pad are 
1500 to 2500 feet away and are activated by the tremors and sounds 
of liftoff photographers are kept about four miles from the launch 
pad 
the agreement gives the defense department the right to review 
any film of an accident and to keep any it feels would disclose 
classified information 
air force lt col ron rand said the department needs to ensure 
that no photos show the classified payload which might be exposed 
in an accident experts believe the payload to be a spy satellite 
the air force agreement had not been required for other shuttle 
missions with military payloads rand said it is linked to nasas 
signed agreement with news groups before the discovery shuttle 
launch sept 29 the first launch after the jan 28 1986 explosion 
of the challenger 
nasa had a written agreement so we needed something in 
writing rand said 
the national aeronautics and space administration agreement lets 
news organizations process their own remotecamera film and give it 
to investigators only after using what they need nasa eventually 
would return all film 
we felt the agreement reached after the challenger explosion 
was sufficient this one didnt sound definitive enough said 
foster marshall timesunion assistant managing editor for graphics 
at least a dozen news organizations accepted the agreement 
several said they would leave their cameras at the site while they 
made formal protests and their lawyers studied the requirement 
we will formally protest because it is an unreasonable and 
silly attempt to impose censorship after the launch said sam 
terilli general counsel for the miami herald 
i thought it was a bad precedent said ron cohen executive 
editor of gannett news service the demand that film be 
confiscated was a clear case of a federal agency making an arbitrary 
decision restricting first amendment rights 
the gannett cameras were put in place before the news services 
executives were aware of the new policy and were removed at the 
first opportunity which was after thursdays launch was scrubbed 
cohen said

nasa knows it cant do anything about 
the weather at its florida launch site but the space agency 
probably wishes it didnt have to spend so much time talking about 
it 
winds clouds or storms have forced changes in liftoff plans for 
the space shuttle eight times including thursdays postponement of 
the atlantis launch three times florida landings have been 
canceled because of weather 
weather played a role in nasas worst moment the explosion of 
challenger on jan 28 1986 that claimed the lives of seven 
astronauts 
the kennedy space center sits on a marshy island that is captive 
to the shifting winds frequent rain and powerful fronts moving in 
from the north that keep the coastal weather in a turmoil of change 
the capricious weather has only a minor effect on conventional 
aircraft and mattered little in the early days of nasa when 
unmanned rockets could easily cut through clouds or strong winds on 
their way into space 
but the shuttle which goes higher and faster then returns to 
earth as a glider is more sensitive to the forces of nature 
launcharea winds as low as 20 miles an hour can keep the shuttle on 
earth highaltitude winds smashing into the shuttle as it races 
upward can be violent enough to destroy the spacecraft it was the 
threat of such winds that forced the postponement thursday 
weather rules regulating the launch of the shuttle fill a thick 
volume and it takes a small army of forecasters and observers to 
monitor the subtle atmospheric changes that can affect the spaceship 
some of the rules are new created after subfreezing 
temperatures are thought to have contributed to the failure of a 
solidfuel rocket booster that caused the challenger accident 
shuttle flights depend not only on the weather in florida but 
also on conditions thousands of miles away since the spacecraft 
could be forced to land on emergency runways in europe north africa 
or california bad weather at those distant sites can force a launch 
delay 
atlantis commander robert l gibson twice suffered through a 
weather delay in his first space command his 1986 flight on 
columbia was postponed once because of poor weather in moron spain 
an emergency landing site and once because of heavy rains on the 
launch pad 
after he got in orbit gibson three times made plans to land in 
florida and three times was disappointed he finally ended his 
columbia flight with a touchdown on the desert lake bed at edwards 
air force base in california where weather is seldom a problem 
nasa has decided for the immediate future to land all shuttles at 
edwards

a pathologist acquitted of charges he 
killed his cancerstricken wife to end her suffering says his first 
job is putting his life back together but he doesnt know where 
hell begin 
ive got a lot of pieces its going to take a lot of work 
dr peter rosier said thursday after a jury cleared him of all 
charges in the jan 15 1986 death of his 43yearold terminally 
ill wife patricia 
after deliberating a little more than three hours in the 
fourweek trial the pinellas county surrogate court panel cleared 
rosier 47 of firstdegree murder attempted murder and conspiracy 
as the verdict was read rosier wept and relatives in the 
courtroom screamed with joy if convicted he could have been 
sentenced to life in prison 
rosier hugged his children jacob 19 and elizabeth 21 who 
supported him and attended the trial daily 
the physician said his family wants him to resume his medical 
practice but hes doubtful about that ive dealt with a lot of 
cancer and death he said 
assistant state attorney ed volz said he was disappointed with 
the verdict but felt the prosecution handled the case well the 
jury made a decision based upon the facts said volz im never 
surprised by what a jury does 
defense attorney stanley rosenblatt said the case never should 
have gone to trial for the state to charge firstdegree murder 
bordered on insanity rosenblatt said 
the state maintained that rosier obtained sedatives for his wife 
to commit suicide then administered morphine when they only left 
her comatose eventually he manipulated her stepfather and brothers 
into finishing the job the state argued 
but the defense portrayed rosier as a loving husband of 22 years 
who wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painful 
end 
if anything good has come out of this it is perhaps that 
people in the us will start to look at the terminally ill and the 
rights of the terminally ill because of the terrible tragedy that 
befell patricia rosier and the rest of our family rosier said 
derek humphry president of the proeuthanasia hemlock society 
hailed the verdict and called for a change in laws to allow a 
painless death to end suffering 
the acquittal sends a signal that jurors are not likely to 
convict in assisted suicide cases otherwise known as euthanasia 
it is time to modify the law to permit physicians to help terminal 
patients who request help with death he said 
the prosecution charged that rosier pained by his wifes 
fastspreading lung cancer obtained 20 seconals for her to take and 
administered morphine injections and suppositories when the sedative 
failed to work 
her stepfather vincent delman testified that he went into her 
bedroom with his two sons russell and farrell after she lingered 
for 12 hours in a coma and smothered her 
the delmans were key prosecution witnesses who testified under a 
grant of immunity given before the state knew the extent of their 
involvement 
the charges were brought after rosier appeared on a tv interview 
and talked about administering drug overdoses to his wife 
volz said rosier used the broadcast to try to spark interest in 
an unpublished book about mrs rosiers life and death which he 
wanted to parlay into a movie

sinhalese militants fired guns and 
threw bombs at a presidential campaign rally killing five people 
and wounding 25 authorities said today 
eleven gunmen staged the attack during a rally thursday night in 
suburban colombo for ossie abeygoonsekera candidate of the united 
socialist alliance authorities said 
the victims included one of abeygoonsekeras bodyguards and 
devabandara senaratne vice president of the sri lanka peoples 
party one of four parties that form the alliance officials said 
it was the second attack in less than a month on a campaign rally 
for abeygoonsekera on nov 17 suspected sinhalese militants threw 
bombs at another campaign meeting killing three people and injuring 
50 
all three candidates in the dec 19 presidential election have 
received death threats from the peoples liberation front a radical 
sinhalese group demanding the governments resignation 
but abeygoonsekera has been the only candidate to criticize the 
front which has been blamed for more than 900 political murders in 
the past 16 months 
according to police six gunmen hijacked a passenger bus and 
drove to the rally site in kadawatte about 10 miles north of the 
capital five other gunmen were waiting among the spectators police 
said 
while the extremists opened fire from the bus the others at 
the meeting flung five bombs said one police official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
they escaped in the bus and another car the official said 
sinhalese militants are upset at the governments efforts to end 
the 5yearold insurgency by minority tamils fighting for a separate 
homeland 
they contend a peace accord signed in july 1987 grants too many 
concessions to the tamils who make up 18 percent of the islands 16 
million people 
the sinhalese make up 75 percent of the islands population and 
control the government and the military 
sinhalese militants have been demanding the resignation of 
president junius r jayewardenes government 
jayewardene a sinhalese is not seeking reelection and has said 
he will step down and dissolve parliament after his successor is 
chosen 
besides abeygoonsekera the other candidates are prime minister 
ramasinghe premadasa of the united national party and sirimavo 
bandaranaike former prime minister and leader of the sri lanka

a fugitive mental patient suspected in a 
deadly new mexico shooting spree shot a universal studios guard to 
death then was critically wounded in a gunfight before screaming 
help me kill me to his captors 
nathan nick trupp 42 the subject of a nationwide manhunt 
following the slayings tuesday of three people in an albuquerque 
shopping mall shot one guard dead and critically wounded another 
thursday night before being wounded by los angeles county sheriffs 
deputies officials said 
as he was strapped onto a stretcher the bleeding trupp could be 
seen on television news reports screaming help me kill me 
trupp was in critical condition today after surgery for chest and 
arm wounds at st joseph medical center in nearby burbank said a 
hospital spokeswoman who refused to give her name 
one of the charges he will face will probably be murder said 
deputy roger hom as soon as he is able he will probably be moved 
to the jail ward at countyusc medical center 
hom identified the dead guard as jeren beeks 27 of la 
crescenta guard armando torres 20 was in critical condition at 
st joseph with a head wound 
universal studios a 420acre site 10 miles northwest of downtown 
los angeles houses an amusement park movie and television studios 
and offices 
trupp walked up to a guard shack at an employees entrance to the 
entertainment complex and opened fire with a handgun shooting both 
guards in the head said deputy van mosley authorities did not know 
what prompted the attack mosley said 
sheriffs deputies aided by a third guard who was not hit 
spotted trupp about a block away within minutes of the attack 
mosley said 
they engaged in a gunbattle mosley said 
the albuquerque journal reported today that trupp walked away 
from the trenton psychiatric hospital in new jersey last year and 
moved to albuquerque 
trupps older brother philip a washington dc author told 
the journal his brother has a lifelong history of mental problems 
but no prior record of violence 
this was a perfectly gentle person philip trupp said in a 
telephone interview thursday several hours before the shootings at 
universal studios 
philip trupp said his brother moved to new mexico after leaving 
the trenton institution which is new jerseys main psychiatric 
hospital 
they gave him a furlough and he never came back he said 
albuquerque authorities had been searching for trupp as the 
suspected gunman who complained of poisoned bagels then killed 
three people at a bagel shop in an albuquerque mall 
slain were richard wilt 39 his wife jeanne wilt 37 both of 
albuquerque and the womans father joseph famiglietta sr 63 of 
nearby rio rancho 
police raided trupps albuquerque apartment wednesday morning 
apparently minutes after he left town they said they knew of no 
motive for the mall shootings 
albuquerque police sgt ruth lowe said background checks of all 
three victims and trupp did not shed any light on the slayings the 
new mexico organized crime commission and the fbi were assisting in 
the investigation 
we cant find anywhere where hes been arrested lowe said 
neighbors in albuquerque described trupp as quiet 
he wasnt an overly friendly guy said bob ross he didnt 
work anywhere as far as i could tell i never got the impression at 
all for him to be violent

a new study suggesting vitamins taken by women 
helped prevent certain birth defects in their children needs further 
scrutiny doctors say 
medical researchers interviewed more than 3000 mothers and found 
that those who took vitamins about the time of conception were less 
likely to have babies with brain and spine defects than other women 
but the researchers are unsure whether to credit the vitamins or 
some other factor like diet 
evidence remains too thin to recommend that women planning 
pregnancies take vitamins to try to ward off birth defects said dr 
joseph mulinare who led the study group at the national centers for 
disease control in atlanta 
such a simple solution is almost too good to be true said an 
editorial accompanying the study in todays journal of the american 
medical association we need confirmation of this finding from 
other studies 
still the results are valuable because they are a starting point 
for further research into vitamins as a guard against defects like 
anencephaly and spina bifida mulinare said thursday 
anencephaly the absence of major parts of the brain usually is 
fatal after a few hours spina bifida the incomplete closing of the 
bony casing around the spinal cord typically causes mild to severe 
paralysis of the lower body 
the defects are equally common and strike about 3500 infants 
each year in the united states mulinare said 
he and his colleagues looked at data on all babies born with at 
least one of the defects in the fivecounty atlanta area from 1968 
through 1980 
the researchers interviewed mothers of 347 babies born with the 
defects and 2829 mothers of defectfree babies chosen randomly for 
comparison 
the mothers were asked if they had taken vitamins at least three 
times a week during the three months before they became pregnant and 
at least three months after conception 
fourteen percent of all the mothers reported taking multivitamins 
or their equivalent during the entire sixmonth period and 40 
percent reported using no vitamins the remainder of the mothers 
either took vitamins only part of the time or couldnt recall the 
researchers said 
we found that women who reported using multivitamins three 
months prior to conception and in the first three months after 
conception had a 50 to 60 percent reduction in risk of having a baby 
with anencephaly or spina bifida compared with women who reported 
not having used any vitamins in that same time period mulinare 
said 
the researchers made adjustments for differences in the ages of 
the mothers their education levels alcohol use past unsuccessful 
pregnancies spermicide use smoking habits and chronic illnesses 
all of those factors have been linked to differences in birth defect 
rates in past research 
the findings come five years after a british report found 
multivitamin use by mothers who already had one baby with a birth 
defect seemed to help prevent similar defects in children the 
researchers said 
dr lewis b holmes of massachusetts general hospital wrote in an 
editorial accompanying the new study that genetic factors may cause 
some kinds of spina bifida and that vitamins even if effective 
would be unlikely to prevent all cases

west germans today marked the 50th anniversary of 
the discovery of nuclear fission with mixed emotions recalling the 
breakthrough that led to atomic bombings of japan and the chernobyl 
nuclear disaster 
the main ceremony was held in west berlins congress hall just a 
few miles from the laboratory where german scientists otto hahn and 
fritz strassmann conducted their pioneering scientific work in 
december 1938 
words of homage were paid their work but speakers also 
emphasized the troubling consequences of the discovery that 
splitting the uranium atom can lead to the release of massive 
amounts of energy 
the bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki more than anything else 
have taken away any kind of relaxed attitude toward nuclear fission 
in todays thinking said heinz a staab president of the 
maxplanck scientific research institute 
us atomic bombs dropped aug 6 1945 on hiroshima and three 
days later on nagasaki killed about 210000 people and led to 
japans surrender to end world war ii 
staab told about 1100 guests the euphoria of the 1950s for a 
peaceful use of nuclear fission for producing energy has given way 
to a skeptical judgment since chernobyl 
the 1986 chernobyl accident that killed 31 people in the soviet 
union sent clouds of radioactivity over western europe 
resistance to nuclear energy remains especially strong among 
young west germans who oppose the stationing of nuclear rockets on 
their soil 
west berlin mayor eberhard diepgen said this discovery changed 
the world like hardly any other one before it 
today we recall this great scientific deed without being able 
to celebrate diepgen said he said honor for the achievement must 
include a recollection of the consequences from hiroshima to 
chernobyl 
the prestigious maxplanck institute along with four other 
scientific research organizations sponsored the ceremony it was 
held two weeks before the actual 50th anniversary of the key 
experiment which started dec 16 1938 
hahn received the 1944 nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery 
at the kaiser wilhelm institute for chemistry in berlin 
hahn and strassmann found that bombarding the uranium atom with 
neutrons leads to its splitting but at first they didnt understand 
the full implications of their work 
then from her exile in sweden their jewish colleague lise 
meitner furnished the theoretical basis showing that such a 
splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain 
reactions based on albert einsteins theory of relativity her 
partner otto robert frisch also contributed to the theoretical 
work 
miss meitner had been driven into exile by the nazis several 
months before the discovery 
the nazi era cast a shadow over another part of the work 
albert speer a former top aide to adolf hitler strongly implied 
that hahn was one of a group of german scientists seeking ways to 
build an atomic bomb before the americans beat them to it 
speer hitlers armaments minister and the third reichs top 
architect wrote that in 1942 he had heard of a group of 
scientists who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate 
whole cities perhaps throw the island of england out of the fight 
he wrote that two months later he visited with scientists in 
berlin to be briefed on atomic research as the nazi reich 
struggled to find a way to win world war ii 
along with scientists whose names i no longer recall the 
subsequent nobel prize winners including hahn were present speer 
wrote in his memoirs inside the third reich 
however west berlins tagesspiegel newspaper last week said hahn 
wrote in his diary of having a clean conscience that neither 
during the discovery nor later did i want to work for the use of 
uranium fission as a war weapon 
the newspaper said hahn wrote the passage shortly after the 
united states dropped the bomb on hiroshima at the time hahn and 
other top german atomic scientists were being detained in a british 
camp according to tagesspiegel 
on thursday scientists and officials of the technical university 
in west berlin held a news conference to review the discovery and to 
outline the opening today of their documentary exhibit 
the development of nuclear physics and its technology has found 
interest among the public like no other discovery university vice 
president ulrich steinmueller said 
steinmueller continued the technology carries implicitly in 
its use both in war and peace a threat for mankind the 
wellfounded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge 
to be aware of their responsibilities to society

the weekly mail a prominent 
antiapartheid newspaper returned to newsstands today after a 
fourweek suspension by the government 
were back the newspaper declared on its front page were 
still strong and were ready to carry on fighting 
home affairs minister stoffel botha suspended the weekly mail 
nov 1 saying the publication was a threat to the safety of the 
public botha has shut down three antigovernment newspapers this 
year but all resumed publishing after suspensions ranging from four 
to 12 weeks 
the weekly mail with a circulation of about 22000 nationwide 
is aimed largely at liberal whites and is considered by many to be 
south africas bestwritten newspaper 
since it was established in 1985 the newspaper has been a 
combative government opponent known for aggressive reporting and 
sassy political commentary 
the weekly mail may have offended stoffel botha but it did not 
break any law the newspaper said in a frontpage editorial our 
crime was to criticize the government and raise questions about 
its policies and behavior we will continue to do this 
botha could again suspend the newspaper for up to three months 
we cant deny that the months suspension has hurt the 
newspaper said noting the loss of advertising and sales revenue 
but the extraordinary level of support we have received makes 
us confident about our future it added 
the edition contained several advertisements purchased by its 
corporate and political supporters welcoming its return 
the weekly mail has said that bothas complaints focused on the 
newspapers coverage of security force actions and reports about 
banned organizations such as the african national congress guerrilla 
movement 
todays edition contained an article on blacks who have died 
while in police custody and a story about recently released prisoner 
harry gwala a longtime anc member 
other stories focused on whites who have refused to perform 
compulsory military service and on a black man who was on trial for 
3 years before being acquitted of treason charges 
bothas powers to suspend newspapers are part of the numerous 
media restrictions imposed under the countrys 29monthold state of 
emergency the regulations restrict reporting on security force 
actions many forms of peaceful protest and a wide range of 
statements the government considers subversive 
in another development the government ordered the antiapartheid 
afrikaanslanguage newspaper vrye weekblad to pay a 13000 deposit 
for a registration certificate 
if the newspaper does not pay the government could shut it down 
the government has not said why it is seeking the amount believed 
to be the largest security deposit ever demanded in south africa 
there is no fixed amount required for a registration certificate 
and some publications have paid less than 45 
the government already has complained about articles in the 
weekly newspaper which has been publishing for only a few weeks 
under apartheid the nations 26 million black majority has no 
voice in national affairs

television viewing rose slightly during november 
but the networks share of viewership declined as independent 
stations and pay cables share increased compared with the same 
period a year ago 
independent stations which have become more aggressive about 
programming during sweeps periods racked up a 47 percent increase 
in ratings for november compared to the same period last year 
according to the ac nielsen co pay cable was up 33 percent 
the networks rebounded a bit during the month thanks to abcs 
miniseries war and remembrance 
overall network viewing had been off 6 percent so far this 
season in november it was off about 3 percent abc which came in 
third last season saw its viewing rise 10 percent 
look for january to be critical for the networks in terms of 
reestablishing series viewing patterns said david poltrack cbs 
vice president for marketing 
he predicted that in the january sweeps without stiff 
competition from independent stations and cable and with the full 
schedule of strikedelayed 198889 network shows finally on the air 
the networks might have a chance to get back some of their audience 
nbc with five of the top 10 series and the five toprated 
movies won the sweeps one of four months a year when network 
affiliates ratings are measured for purposes of negotiating local 
advertising rates 
nbc had an average primetime rating of 154 abc 140 and cbs 
120 each rating point represents 904000 households with 
televisions 
nbcs the cosby show was the highestrated network show with 
a rating of 263 down from the 323 the show got in november 1987 
in fact all of the toprated series ratings declined 
poltrack said the fourmonth writers strike last summer hurt cbs 
the most leaving it without some new series and fewer movies to 
fill in the gaps 
because of strikecaused production delays on its regular series 
abc rushed to the air with the first 18 hours of its more than 
30hour war and remembrance sequel to the winds of war 
it ended with a disappointing 186 rating but helped save abc 
from third place in the sweeps abc will run the remainder of the 
miniseries in may said spokeswoman janice gretemeyer 
fox broadcasting co whose affiliates are counted as independent 
stations experienced a rise in ratings 55 compared with 37 a 
year ago fox had new episodes of its most popular programs 
americas most wanted and married with children when 
the networks were in repeats 
independent stations also did well by taking over what was 
previously a network source of programming threatrical release 
movies 
the networks have all but abandoned them as a source of ratings 
said poltrack meanwhile independent stations are garnering 
competitive ratings by running such films as 48 hours and the 
godfather 
hbos rating was 83 compared to 69 a year ago that was the 
first increase for hbo in the five years since the networks began 
analyzing pay cable performance during sweeps

an israeli counterterrorism expert who 
briefed vice president george bush on secret arms sales to iran died 
in a plane crash in a remote area of mexico while traveling under an 
assumed name officials said 
the cessna t210 crashed wednesday at a ranch 110 miles west of 
mexico city killing the israeli amiram nir 37 and the pilot 
three other passengers were badly injured including adriana 
stanton 25 of canada 
nir was traveling under the name pat weber isauro gutierrez 
fernandez a spokesman for the michoacan state attorney general 
said thursday 
israels ambassador to mexico dov schmorak said in an interview 
broadcast today on israels armed forces radio that he did not know 
why nir was in mexico or why he used that name 
gutierrez said engine failure was the probable cause of the crash 
but schmorak told the radio that mexican authorities said 
preliminary information that suggested the crash was caused by a 
violent rain storm 
a foreign ministry official in jerusalem who spoke on condition 
of anonymity told the radio nir was on private business 
nir a former adviser on counterterrorism to two israeli prime 
ministers was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving 
the sale of us weapons to iran according to testimony given to 
us congressional investigators 
former white house aide oliver north who was deeply involved in 
the usiranian arms transactions suggested during congressional 
testimony that the contra link diverting funds from us arms 
sales to iran to nicaraguan rebels was nirs idea israel denied 
it 
nir was sought for questioning by special us prosecutor 
lawrence e walsh israel insisted nir be granted immunity from 
prosecution 
schmorak told the radio nir apparently missed a regularly 
scheduled flight and hired a private plane 
gutierrez said nir arrived sunday in mexico city and traveled to 
uruapan 190 miles west to stay with friends 
it appears he had some possible business involving shipments of 
products from latin america to europe gutierrez said he refused 
to elaborate 
a state attorney generals statement identified the dead pilot as 
pedro espinoza hurtado 34 and the others injured as guillermo 
joaonde amezqua 35 and ester areaga 23 
an airport official in uruapan said the cessna was bound for 
mexico city 
the plane belonging to aerotaxis of uruapan took off wednesday 
afternoon from uruapan and crashed 30 minutes later near ciudad 
hidalgo the statement said 
nir was a close associate of shimon peres now foreign minister 
of israel peres prime minister from 198486 appointed nir adviser 
on counterterrorism in 1985 and assigned him to serve as liaison 
with north 
in january 1986 nir met in washington with north and adm john 
poindexter the national security adviser and proposed to renew 
arms shipments to iran 
nir also met with north in israel and europe discussing us 
arms sales to iran through israel and the diversion of profits to 
the contras despite a congressional ban on military aid to the 
rebels 
nir also traveled to tehran iran in may 1986 with north and 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane to discuss the 
release of american hostages held by proiranian extremists in 
lebanon in return for the supply of antiaircraft hawk missiles 
nir briefed bush on the program involving us weapons sales to 
iran in jerusalem on july 27 1986 bush has said he does not 
remember much about the briefing but his aide craig fuller attended 
the meeting and took notes 
nir a former journalist remained on after yitzhak shamir 
succeeded peres as prime minister in october 1986 and the 
irancontra affair exploded that november he resigned this year 
israeli leaders admitted selling weapons to iran but only in 
cooperation with the united states israel also denied any knowledge 
of the contra connection

nato defense ministers tackled the 
potentially divisive issue of how to fairly share the cost of 
maintaining the alliance officials said today at the conclusion to 
a twoday meeting 
the defense ministers agreed there are significant variations 
in the scale and nature of their contributions but the final 
communique said europe and the united states remained steadfast 
partners 
once and for all it is clear this is not a matter of the united 
states versus the rest of the alliance this is a joint alliance 
effort nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said 
however us secretary of defense frank carlucci stressed the 
report showed nations are not bearing a fair share of the common 
defense burden an issue that caused us congressional critics to 
raise the prospect of withdrawing some of the 326000 us troops 
stationed in europe 
carlucci said it was now natos task to create an effective 
followup in a manner that serves to strengthen the cohesion of the 
alliance and allied defense capabilities 
woerner said the meeting achieved that we did not only deliver 
words but deeds woerner said we did not only speak of 
improving our defense effort and burden sharing but we took 
decisions 
the ministers approved additional funds for transferring us 
f16 fighter jets from spain to italy and cleared the way for a 
study on a multinational european military unit in northern central 
europe 
a 79page report approved thursday has already produced a number 
of specific commitments by members to improve their contributions 
britains secretary of state for defense george younger said 
the report asked belgium norway denmark the netherlands west 
germany canada portugal and spain to make bigger budget 
contributions 
the differences between some individual national contributions 
are glaring said the report which urged most european allies to 
boost defense spending upgrade military equipment and become more 
active partners 
the report offered a response to us critics who claim europe is 
not doing enough to maintain natos strength officials said 
guy coeme defense minister for belgium warned the report should 
not be used for mutual reproaches but to boost the collective 
effort for common defense 
the report went beyond analyzing the financial cost to highlight 
the social cost of the european allies who provide facilities 
territory and troops to maintain a credible defense in europe 
many european nations proposed additional efforts officials 
said including a plan to introduce a multinational european 
military unit in northern central europe 
the project is only in the initial stage of study but younger 
urged nato as a whole should profit from the intitiative 
the report estimated the united states spent an average 598 
percent of its economic output on defense from 1983 to 1987 tops 
was greece which spent 652 percent 
britain devoted 501 percent of its gross domestic product to 
defense turkey 4 percent and germany 32 percent 
others were belgium 326 percent canada 217 percent 
denmark 22 percent italy 216 percent luxembourg 118 percent 
netherlands 332 percent norway 293 percent portugal 322 
percent and spain 237 percent iceland was not included in the 
table

federal agents ended the mafias days of 
wine and roses busting up a drug ring in the united states and 
italy that smuggled heroin into this country in wine bottles and 
shipments of flowers 
the sting operation which began in a small suburban buffalo 
storefront shut down a massive american and sicilian mafia 
narcotics operation that was selling millions of dollars worth of 
heroin in the united states and cocaine in italy the fbi and 
federal prosecutors said thursday 
as a result of the threeyear investigation which broadened to 
include fbi offices nationwide the fbi and italian authorities have 
charged more than 200 people including sicilian mafia figures and 
associates of the gambino crime family in new york a total of 68 
people were charged in the united states and 133 in italy 
some of the heroin smuggled into the united states was liquified 
and put into bottles purported to be sicilian wine without the 
knowledge of the vintner the bottles were brought from italy by 
female couriers who strapped the drugs to their bodies officials 
said 
it actually looked like wine in the wine bottle said james 
fox assistant director of the fbis new york office 
heroin also arrived in shipments of roses among other 
subterfuges authorities said 
although the international food trading company set up in buffalo 
by agents never handled any drug shipments it allowed the fbi to 
establish contacts with organized crime operations in the united 
states and italy g robert langford special agent in charge of the 
fbis buffalo office said thursday 
agents traveled to italy and posed as buyers who discussed making 
major drug purchases the fbi said 
substantial amounts of imported heroin were sold to the gambino 
mafia family in new york which allegedly arranged for nationwide 
distribution according to a complaint filed in the case in 
philadelphia some of the heroin was passed to buyers in us pizza 
parlors other drugs were concealed in wine shipments 
one of those arrested in the police roundup was giuseppe gambino 
a nephew of carlo gambino the late reputed head of the gambino 
crime family 
a complaint filed in manhattan against 28 people alleged that the 
organization obtained cocaine in the us transported the cocaine 
over to italy exchanged the cocaine for heroin so the cocaine was 
sold in italy and the heroin was sold in the us us attorney 
rudolph giuliani said 
they found the best market for their product the us 
attorney added 
this is the largest example so far of the mafias involvement 
in cocaine which is something that was unheard of a few years 
ago giuliani said 
they were selling kilos of heroin for approximately 200000 a 
kilo they were trading in multikilo quantities said fox 
there were millions and millions of dollars 
what had started as an independent fbi probe of drug trafficking 
in philadelphia codenamed iron tower was coordinated with the 
buffalo probe when some names of suspected traffickers turned up in 
both said the fbi the philadelphia probe was named after a town in 
sicily called torretta the fbi said one of those being sought in 
the case in the united states tommaso scalici is an italian 
citizen from torretta said an fbi spokesman in new jersey james 
knights scalici is charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin 
the operation in buffalo began when agents learned from an 
informer in a 1983 drug bust that organized crime families in sicily 
wanted to set up an importexport company as a front for drug 
operations 
buffalo was chosen because of its proximity to the canadian 
border knights said adding that the peace bridge connecting 
buffalo and fort erie ontario was an entry point for earlier drug 
shipments from italy to the united states 
undercover agents began working on the case dubbed busico an 
acronym for the buffalosicilian connection in 1985 
with the cooperation of the us customs office in buffalo the 
fbi rented a storefront in a shopping plaza in the buffalo suburb of 
hamburg and set up the company called bsc wholesale inc 
the exportimport business which did buy and sell tomato paste 
and olive oil never materialized as a major drug distribution point 
but at the same time the buffalo agents began making purchases 
of heroin cocaine and other drugs from various drug dealers who 
claimed to have international connections most of the deals took 
place in other cities and gradually came to involve fbi offices 
throughout the country langford said 
us attorney dennis vacco called the operation a classic 
sting 
arrests were made in baltimore buffalo ny miami newark 
nj new york philadelphia san francisco and rockford ill in 
italy arrests were being made in palermo bologna and florence

department of energy officials have set 
guidelines for restarting the nuclear reactors that are the nations 
source of tritium for nuclear warheads 
the guidelines which include calls for unannounced inspections 
and setting training and safety standards consistent with those in 
place for commercial nuclear reactors clear the way for a restart 
of the three savannah river plant reactors the only ones now 
capable of supplying the nations stockpile of tritium 
due to problems encountered during an august restart of 
preactor doe officials have kept the reactors off line until the 
guidelines for reactor restarts could be written the reactors 
remain shut down for maintenance and safety upgrades 
on tuesday doe secretary john herrington said the department 
hopes to restart kreactor at the aiken sc plant by late spring 
or early summer 
details on the new guidelines which have not been made public 
were obtained by the morris news services washington bureau 
according to a story published in the augustabased morris 
communications corp newspapers 
the news service quoted unidentified sources in the department of 
energy as saying the restart of the kreactor and other reactors 
will be keyed to implementation of the specific goals outlined in 
the report 
deadlines for complying with the goals set out in the report will 
be established in a few weeks the news service said 
the report calls for improvements in plant systems and components 
to assure that the reactors can operate as designed within preset 
margins of safety 
among its specific guidelines the report calls for the addition 
of a fifth work shift per reactor hiring shift supervisors with 
fouryear science or technical degrees adding of an engineer 
certified by the nuclear regulatory commission to each shift 
offering more advanced training for reactor operators and setting 
training standards that are consistent with the commercial nuclear 
industry 
another area of the report calls for standard maintenance and 
testing procedures new safety analysis criteria and revised 
procedures for reporting unusual reactor incidents to doe officials 
the report also calls for improved onsite technical vigilance 
and monitoring including increased use of onsite engineers backed 
by outside experts and consultants implementation of more technical 
training programs and requirements that reports be channeled to 
washington 
administration and congressional sources have said the nations 
stockpiles of tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to 
boost the yield of nuclear weapons will be depleted badly within 
six months to two years

a nursing homes representative said today a 
75volume federal consumers guide that reports poor sanitary 
conditions and other problems at many of the nations nursing homes 
will confuse people looking for the best facility 
the designer of the study which seeks to make available the 
results of thousands of spot inspections said the report gives 
valuable information but should not replace personal inspection by 
patients or relatives considering a home 
the guide shows how each of the nations 15000 nursing homes 
fared in inspections conducted within the last 18 months allowing 
anyone looking for a home to make comparisions within their 
communities 
an overview showed 43 percent had substandard santitation in food 
services and 30 percent failed to administer drugs properly or to 
ensure basic hygiene for patients the seriousness of violations was 
not indicated 
overall the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 of 32 
categories chosen for inclusion in the report but about 2400 
nursing homes received passing marks in all 32 
we cant tell from the study what is trivial and what is 
important said paul willging executive vice president of the 
9000member american health care association the major nursing 
home trade group the incompleteness of the data is going to 
conuse the american consumer 
willging in an interview on nbctvs today show noted that 
the report does not include serious violations which he said are 
usually found in regular inspections and ordered corrected at the 
time they are found 
by focusing on sometimestrivial violations it fails to give 
more important information about whether homes offer nutritious food 
that tastes good or has programs to deal with overweight patients or 
other problems he said 
the consumer doesnt want to know whether two years ago the 
temperature of the water in a dishwasher was off by two degrees 
he said 
william l roper head of the health care financing 
administration which oversees medicare and medicaid and put out the 
report said the 32 indicators checked in the inspections were the 
most important ones affecting care of the elderly 
they are not trivial items he said on nbc we think this 
is important information but he also cautioned that the report 
should not substitute for visits to homes before one is chosen 
its not a definitive study of the level of care in all nursing 
homes roper said referring to it as a snapshot of conditions 
fouind on a given day 
roper in releasing the huge stacks of printed reports thursday 
for each state called the project a landmark achievement not 
because it is an end in itself but because it will help people pose 
thoughtful further questions in seeking out a nursing home 
the most recent of the inspection reports forming the basis for 
the hcfa report were six months old and some go back as much as 18 
months 
by law the latest reports must be available for inspection on 
the premises of each nursing home and both government and industry 
officials urged consumers to inspect them before making a final 
judgment on a particular facility 
elma holder director of the national citizens coalition for 
nursing home reform said roper should be embarrassed and ashamed 
to present these documents so proudly at best they provide a 
teaser to the consumers to try to obtain a copy of the full survey 
report of the facility 
she suggested conditions are worse in the nations nursing homes 
than the report indicates 
the american association of retired persons on the other hand 
praised the report as a good start toward full disclosure of 
information about nursing home quality 
we are pleased that the federal government has taken valuable 
information about the quality of nursing home care out of its 
computers and made it available to the individuals and families who 
need it most said aarp executive director horace deets 
aarp has arranged to have copies of the report available at its 
regional offices around the nation copies also will be supplied to 
various government and private organizations concerned with nursing 
home standards in the various states 
in addition to problems with food sanitation and drug 
distribution the report found 247 percent failed to meet standards 
for isolation techniques to prevent the spread of infection and 216 
percent failed in rehabilitative care to promote maximum physical 
functioning and prevent loss of ability to walk and otherwise move 
freely 
none of the other 27 categories registered an unmet 
percentage above 20 percent 
at the top end the report shows that 997 percent of nursing 
homes meet requirements for discharging or transferring patients 
996 percent allow residents to communicate freely with others 995 
percent provide emergency medical services as necessary

a kidnapped swiss red cross worker today 
sent a letter urging switzerland to cooperate with his captors to 
save my life 
the swiss government said the hijacking and the letter which was 
authenticated by the international committee of the red cross is an 
attempt to force the release of a shiite moslem hijacker held in 
switzerland 
the government urged all swiss people to leave lebanon 
in beirut the spiritual guide of proiranian shiite militants 
charged that washington has hindered the release of the nine 
american hostages 
i have information that the americans are the ones who 
complicated the issue of the hostages sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah said in an interview today in the weekly magazine 
ashshiraa 
america is after resuming ties with iran but it wants ties 
resumed without making any political concession 
iran rejects a resumption of ties unless america changes its 
hostile policy toward iran and works out some details related to 
bilateral relations including the frozen iranian assets said 
fadlallah 
he was referring to assets frozen in the united states after 
militants stormed the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 and 
held 52 americans hostage for 444 days 
in bern foreign ministry official edouard brunner said peter 
winklers letter said his abduction was intended to pressure the 
swiss government 
i was not kidnapped as a red cross delegate but as a swiss 
citizen my government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it 
has to cooperate in order to save my life said the letter 
swiss authorities say they have not received demands from the 
kidnappers and nobody has claimed responsibility for winklers 
abduction 
but it looks very much like blackmail brunner told a news 
conference 
the plane hijacker arrested in geneva is hussein hariri 22 a 
lebanese shiite moslem who commandeered an air afrique jetliner to 
geneva in july 1987 he killed a french passenger before being 
overpowered and arrested 
hariri is to go on trial on various charges feb 20 in 
switzerlands supreme court he could face life imprisonment 
the letter was received earlier today by a western news agency in 
beirut it is the first news of winkler 32 since he was abducted 
at gunpoint nov 17 in the southern lebanese city of sidon 
further abductions cannot be excluded brunner said the 
government urged the 150 to 200 swiss citizens living in lebanon to 
leave and told all swiss to avoid traveling there for nonessential 
reasons such as tourism he said 
the allswiss committee of the red cross suspended its operations 
in sidon after winklers abduction and withdrew five other delegates 
based in the city 
brunner said switzerland will ask syria lebanon iran and the 
palestine liberation organization to help secure winklers freedom 
we appeal for the help of all governments who might be able to 
use their moral and political influence he said 
winklers committee said in a statement that his abduction is 
an unacceptable attack against its humanitarian mission and 
appealed for absolute respect of its personnel

police chief daryl gates was ordered by a jury 
to personally pay 170000 to a man whose nose was broken and whose 
house was ransacked by antigang police officers searching for a 
murder weapon 
a us district court jury deliberated less than two hours before 
reaching its verdict thursday and making the award to the family of 
jessie larez 
gates denounced the decision saying it was based on faulty 
evidence 
comments gates made earlier this week to reporters in which he 
said that larez was lucky that only his nose was broken were 
admitted into evidence during the trial 
the integrity of the whole system of justice at the federal 
level clearly mandated that these proceedings be declared a 
mistrial the chief said 
mayor tom bradley issued a statement urging that the verdict be 
overturned 
if the judgment is upheld the city council must decide whether 
the city or gates would have to pay the damages 
the larez familys attorney stephen yagman said the family will 
only accept the punitive award if it comes out of gates pocket 
we want to send a message to daryl gates and to city hall that 
this kind of lawless behavior among officers that he has ratified by 
his own comments and behavior will no longer be tolerated by members 
of this community yagman said 
in october the same jury awarded 90000 to the larez family 
after family members testified that police conducting the 1986 raid 
broke larezs nose pulled the hair of one of larezs daughters 
intimidated other members of the family and broke personal property 
that judgment against the police department involved six gang 
detail officers the department delayed a decision on appealing the 
award pending thursdays verdict 
during the second portion of the trial concluded thursday the 
jury had to determine whether gates was accountable for actions of 
officers who raided the larez home in search of a murder weapon used 
in a gang slaying the weapon was never found 
speaking to reporters tuesday outside the courtroom of judge 
robert m takasugi gates angrily denounced yagman larez and the 
jury yagman has brought several civil suits against various police 
agencies over the years 
how much is a broken nose worth the chief asked given the 
circumstances in this case i dont think its worth anything 
larez is probably lucky thats all he had broken 
people keep asking me chief why dont you do something about 
gang killings i tell my officers why dont you do something 
about gang killings and we do something and then juries give 
90000 
deputy city attorney jeff nelson who defended the police 
department in the case called takasugis decision to allow gates 
comments as evidence very very damaging 
nelson defended gates remarks saying he is entitled to fair 
comment just like anyone else

told the belgian premier today that his refusal to extradite a 
proira priest has undermined confidence between their countries 
british officials said 
a british spokesman who demanded anonymity told reporters 
mrs thatcher spoke to premier wilfried martens of being mystified 
and deeply wounded and of confidence being dented 
martens told reporters he defended his position during the 
private meeting with mrs thatcher his aides said her attitude was 
acerbic 
the confrontation came just before the start of a european 
economic community summit during which the 12nation west european 
trade bloc will review progress in moves to create a borderless 
singlemarket europe by 1992 
officials said the european leaders would seek to reassure the 
united states and japan the eecs main trading partners that 
efforts to boost trade within the european economic community will 
not be at the expense of imports 
a draft statement states that a single eec market will also 
benefit noncommunity countries 1992 europe will not close in on 
itself will not be a fortress europe but a partnership europe 
earlier today a bomb damaged an eec commission office in athens 
270 miles from the meeting site it was one of four that exploded in 
the greek capital police said no one was injured 
the leftwing revolutionary popular struggle claimed 
responsibility 
the eec leaders accompanied by their foreign ministers started 
the meeting with a luncheon hosted by greek premier andreas 
papandreou the summits chairman 
the summit was being held at the knights palace a 14th century 
castle greek commandos armed with automatic weapons stood guard on 
the battlement of the castle gate as the leaders arrived 
this morning mrs thatcher also met with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and officials said they agreed it would be useful to 
have a summit meeting of the leaders of the 16 nato nations in 
london in may or june 1988 
a meeting between mrs thatcher and charles haughey the irish 
prime minister was canceled by haughey who was said to be upset 
over mrs thatchers criticism of ireland for failing to extradite 
the proira priest 
last week belgium turned down britains request to extradite the 
priest patrick ryan and sent him instead to the irish republic 
where he has taken refuge with an undisclosed religious order 
ryan 58 had been held in a belgian jail since his arrest in 
june 
belgium said the british extradition warrant citing unspecified 
charges of conspiracy to murder and to bomb was flawed 
in the meeting with martens mrs thatcher attacked the belgian 
premier over the extradition of ryan whom british police suspect 
was involved in a string of irish republican army bombings and other 
terrorist related offences 
martens said he told mrs thatcher this decision was taken 
completely legally it was not a political decision

british rule in northern ireland and unite the protestantdominated 
province with the irish republic under leftist rule

the legislature has allowed gov mario 
cuomos deal to buy the 53 billion shoreham nuclear plant for 1 
to fall through leaving the utility free to try to open the 
generating station 
state lawmakers wrapped up a special session thursday without 
taking action on a bill to approve the deal cuomo worked out in june 
with shorehams owners the long island lighting co by failing to 
act cuomo and the utility said the legislature missed a deadline 
that bound both sides to the agreement 
the governor predicted thursday night that the deal was over and 
that state lawmakers had effectively decided to open shoreham 
as far as im concerned tomorrow 1201 dec 2 1988 you 
ought to think of it as black friday said cuomo who added that 
allowing the deadline to pass could prove to be one of the most 
tragic blunders that this legislature ever made 
but the utility offered no indication of its plans 
lilco scheduled a meeting of its board of directors today in 
hicksville to discuss our future course regarding the 
settlement according to utility spokesman james lois lois would 
not speculate about what options lilco might consider 
the deal called for the state to buy the 53 billion shoreham 
facility for 1 and dismantle it in return the utility would get 
guaranteed rate hikes over the next decade totaling more than 60 
percent 
the state under the auspices of the new york power authority 
would build nonnuclear power plants to provide lilco with the 
electricity it would lose if shoreham doesnt open the deal also 
stipulates cuomo says shoreham should not be allowed to open 
because crowded long island couldnt be safely evacuated in the 
event of a serious nuclear accident 
the legislatures refusal to act on a shoreham bill this week was 
due mainly to the determination by the nine state senators from long 
island all republicans that the agreement as now written would be 
too generous to the utility and cause rates to go up higher than 
they have to for the utilitys customers 
most of the discussion at the capitol thursday night in the wake 
of the legislatures departure was over whether the passing of the 
midnight deadline really meant the end of the deal 
the proagreement citizens to settle shoreham group said 
legislators had for all practical purposes opened shoreham that 
organization called long island legislators gutless for not 
dealing with the issue 
according to lois the shoreham agreement stipulates only that 
the parties involved are free to withdraw starting today not 
that the pact falls apart 
but cuomo argued by the time any new agreement is reached 
shoreham could be on its way to winning a license to operate from 
the federal nuclear regulatory commission and lilco would lose its 
incentive to renegotiate the pact 
the governor maintained that the plant could be licensed to 
operate as early as dec 12

the remains of five bodies four of 
them confirmed to be women have been found along two highways in 
southeastern massachusetts prompting worry that a serial killer 
might be behind the deaths 
there are things that are not coincidence that are in 
common bristol county district attorney ronald a pina said after 
the fifth body was found thursday it would appear they are 
connected 
they are all in a geographic location which is very similar 
he said of the bodies found a couple of exits from each other along 
interstate 195 and route 140 in southeastern massachusetts 
pina also said his office has turned up additional evidence that 
it has not disclosed 
state police using specially trained dogs resumed a search today 
of the area near where the partially clothed skeleton was found 
thursday 
the body was located by police dogs along route 140 in freetown 
less than three miles from where the first body was discovered in 
july officials said 
thomas gibney a spokesman for pina said police used 
searchlights thursday night but found no evidence to help the 
investigation an autospy was scheduled today he said 
were hoping we found the last of them and we just have to put 
some of the pieces together gibney said 
gibney said investigators believed the fifth victim also was a 
woman because of the style of the clothing dungarees and a light 
shirt he said the body was severely decomposed and may have been 
there for up to a year 
the district attorney has linked the bodies to the disappearance 
of several women from new bedfords weld square area known by 
police as a center for drug trading and prostitution 
louann silva a resident of weld square said she worried about 
her 15yearold daughter im scared to go to the store myself 
she said 
the four also may be connected with the deaths of two women from 
providence ri whose bodies were found last spring in seekonk 
near interstate 195 and about 10 miles away in attleboro near 
interstate 95 pina said 
pina said he believes the killer was familiar with the area 
i personally dont believe it could have been someone traveling 
through he said it looks like it was someone who was more 
local someone who knew the area someone who felt confident enough 
that they could go there and drop a body off by the road and leave 
officials undertook the search after a body was found last month 
along interstate 195 in dartmouth not far from where two bodies 
were discovered in july 
police dogs tuesday found the skeletal remains of a fourth woman 
along the interstate in dartmouth none of the women has been 
positively identified 
dental records of five women reported missing here in recent 
months were being checked to see if they match any of the bodies 
three of the missing women were either last seen lived near or 
frequented the weld square area 
jimmy giammalvo whose family has run a grocery store on the 
corner of weld square since 1922 said little has changed since the 
first body was found 
they prostitutes come in and out of here all the time its 
business as usual he said

staff eventually 
powell would also become only the fourth black officer to attain 
fourstar rank in the us armed forces if the senate confirms the 
nomination 
he would join air force gen bernard p randolph as the second 
black fourstar officer currently on active duty 
the first such officer in american history was air force gen 
daniel chappie james who won his rank in august 1975 he died 
shortly after retiring in 1978 the second was army gen roscoe 
robinson who won his fourth star on aug 30 1982 and retired in 
november 1985 
in taking over forces command at fort mcpherson in atlanta ga 
powell would succeed gen joseph t palastra jr who has held the 
post since june 1986 and is retiring after 35 years of active 
military service 
the change of command will probably occur in april the army 
said the forces command oversees both active duty and reserve 
troops in the united states except hawaii which falls under the 
pacific command 
the army has 11 full generals but sources at the pentagon said 
the forces command position was likely to be the only fourstar post 
to open during the next year and that rumors had been circulating 
for some time that powell was in line for the job the white house 
handled this one directly said one official 
a tall husky man described as a soldiers soldier who 
doesnt particularly like staff jobs powell has received uniformly 
high marks from official washington for his performance at the white 
house 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said powell and reagan 
have had a close personal relationship 
he was the general who guided preparations for the gorbachev 
summits who helped restructure and give new direction to the 
national security council following the irancontra investigation 
and who by his personal integrity and commitment has restored 
confidence in the national security council itself fitzwater said 
powell succeeded frank c carlucci as reagans national security 
adviser after carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring caspar w 
weinberger as defense secretary a year ago 
carlucci had replaced navy rear adm john m poindexter who 
resigned when the armsforhostage affair became public 
powell first came to the attention of weinberger and carlucci 
when he was tapped as a white house fellow in 1972 he served as 
weinbergers top military aide from 1983 to 1986 then joined the 
nsc staff as carluccis deputy after brief service as commander of 
the armys v corps in west germany 
powell was born in new york city to jamaican immigrants he is a 
graduate of the city college of new york and received a masters 
degree in business administration from george washington university 
here 
commissioned in the infantry in 1958 he was wounded twice during 
two tours in vietnam once falling into a trap lined with sharpened 
bamboo sticks and impaling a foot 
his decorations include the distinguished service medal the 
legion of merit the bronze star and the purple heart 
powell and his wife alma have two daughters and a son

a judge today rejected oliver l norths 
remaining challenges to irancontra charges against him but the 
reagan administrations refusal to release classified document could 
still scuttle the major charges 
us district judge gerhard a gesell rejected the last of the 
former white house aides pretrial motions north had moved to 
dismiss charges that he obstructed congressional inquiries into 
press reports he was violating a ban on helping the nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras 
gesells rulings capped a series of decisions on norths 37 
pretrial motions that left intact 14 of the 16 charges against the 
former national security council aide 
but major counts against north could be dropped if gesell decides 
the defense cannot argue its case without classified documents being 
withheld by the reagan administration 
president reagan insists that the documents are being withheld 
for national security reasons and says the decision is not a ploy 
to prevent north from going to trial 
the things were blocking are the things that duty requires we 
block reagan said thursday these are things that are national 
security secrets 
asked if the move were a backdoor maneuver to keep the case 
against north from going to trial he replied no this is 
something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do 
reagan was questioned at the beginning of a meeting on 
forthcoming trade talks although he defended the decision to 
withhold documents from the trial he backed away from his previous 
insistence that north and his former boss john m poindexter are 
innocent 
on june 27 reagan had said i believe in the innocence of the 
two men and i would like to see that established once and for all 
on thursday reagan said at this stage i dont think i should 
comment on guilt or innocence or anything of this kind i think the 
law has got to take its course 
still the decision to withhold classified documents could enable 
norths lawyers to claim that he is being prevented from presenting 
a full defense to the key allegation against him that he conspired 
illegally to divert more than 14 million in profits from the reagan 
administrations secret iranian weapons deals to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
norths lawyers claim that they need some 40000 pages of secret 
documents to defend him independent counsel lawrence walsh the 
special prosecutor assigned to the case has indicated he can 
proceed without use of the classified information 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said heads of government 
agencies concerned with national security decided in july not to 
release some material sought for the trial he said walsh indicated 
at the time that he could prosecute north on the basis of 
unclassified material 
norths lawyers however are insisting on use of the classified 
material gesell today resumed closed hearings on defense objections 
to deleting classified material from 350 prosecution exhibits 
the secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating to 
the diversion conspiracy and theft of government property 
however north also could be tried on charges he made false 
statements to congress and conspired to use a taxexempt foundation 
for a nonexempt purpose raising money for the contras 
in a court filing made public late thursday walsh disclosed some 
of the types of information that the reagan administration is 
preventing him from using it includes the already widely publicized 
names of several central american countries and the names of 
officials from those nations involved in aiding the contras 
walshs document also indicates that the administration is trying 
to suppress the names of nations from which it tried to solicit 
secret contributions for the contras including saudi arabia and 
south korea 
fitzwater said the white house has offered a briefing to us 
district judge gerhard gesell who is scheduled to preside over 
norths trial but had not received a response fitzwater said it 
was up to the judge to decide if the classified material is 
relevant to norths defense and if it is whether the indictments 
against him should be dismissed or he should be tried 
gesell said recently that he would have little power to control 
the flow of information once the trial started but noted that the 
white house had legal and constitutional means at its disposal to 
prevent disclosures 
fitzwater said white house officials realized when they heard 
this that gesell had not been advised of the action that had been 
taken in july 
consequently white house counsel ab culvahouse wrote walsh a 
letter on the issue of the 40000 or so pages sought by north the 
administration advised walsh that there is information in those 
documents that we know we cannot declassify fitzwater said 
reagan meanwhile reiterated that he is opposed to a 
presidential pardon for north and the other irancontra defendants 
while the criminal case is pending he said pardons would leave them 
under a shadow of guilt for the rest of their lives

a jury verdict that found a blood bank 
negligent for allowing an infant to get aids through a transfusion 
will affect hundreds of similar cases across the country an 
attorney says 
additionally the nations blood supply could be significantly 
improved if blood banks raise their standards in light of thursdays 
decision a key witness in the case said 
in a verdict believed to be the first of its kind a jury found 
the irwin memorial blood bank of san francisco was negligent in 
failing to properly screen its blood supply for the virus that 
causes aids 
the jury also found that the blood bank which supplies blood to 
about 40 hospitals in eight counties in northern california erred 
when it rejected requests by the boys family and friends to donate 
blood for the transfusions 
it shows blood banks that they are indeed vulnerable to jury 
verdicts said plaintiffs attorney michael moriarty 
the suit was filed on behalf of michael osborn now 5 who was 
three weeks old when he received aidscontaminated blood in 1983 
during surgery for a congenital heart defect he tested positive for 
the aids virus in september 1987 
michael now has a brain tumor and lymphoma he has only a few 
months to live said moriarty 
the jury awarded michael 550000 in compensatory damages his 
parents were awarded 200000 to pay for past and future medical and 
nursing bills 
superior court judge andrew ertola did not allow the jury to 
consider awarding punitive damages nor was the jury allowed to give 
the parents any damages for pain and suffering said moriarty 
moriarty said the financial cost may motivate blood banks to 
police themselves more than they are now he said hundreds of 
similar cases are pending across the country 
the blood bank plans to appeal said irwins attorney duncan 
barr 
barr defended irwins decisions in the case in february of 
1983 there was only one case of aids from a transfusion in the 
world he said there was not evidence at that time that this 
was a disease transmitted by blood 
but dr thomas asher a key witness for the family disputed 
barrs assertion that there was no evidence in 1983 that aids was 
transmitted by blood everybody knew it he said 
asher founder and chairman of hemacare corp a private 
forprofit blood bank in sherman oaks called the verdict a 
marvelous thing 
any time more pressure is put on the blood bankers to improve 
the quality of their product the better itll be for the members of 
the public who receive it he said 
both barr and asher said it was the first time a blood bank had 
been found responsible for a transfusionrelated aids case other 
cases have gone to court but have not resulted in verdicts 
asher said that although many blood banks have improved their 
screening and recruiting in the past few years others have not 
much of the blood industry is still dragging their feet he 
said rather than working harder and recruiting harder theyre 
willing to let questionable blood and questionable donors go through 
their system 
mary osborn michaels mother said she and her husband were 
thrilled by the jurys decision 
we just feel this is a great moral victory she said i 
think the blood industry particularly in highrisk areas like san 
francisco has got to shape up 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys immune 
system leaving victims vulnerable to infections the virus is 
spread most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared 
by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring 
as of dec 1 79389 cases had been reported since june 1981 and 
44590 or 56 percent of all victims had died

a leader of angolas anticommunist insurgency 
today criticized the pending agreement that will provide for the 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola contending that the accord 
undercounts the cuban presence by 10000 
jeremias k chitunda vice president of the unita forces since 
1986 said the agreement being negotiated in usmediated talks 
calls for the withdrawal of 50000 cuban forces over a 27month 
period 
chitunda said in an interview that the removal of that number of 
cubans would still leave 10000 at the disposal of angolas leftist 
government after the withdrawal timetable ends 
in addition he said 20000 other cubans have been given angolan 
citizenship and are capable of providing assistance to the angolan 
army 
there is very little in it for us to rejoice about chitunda 
said alluding to the agreement being worked out by officials from 
south africa angola and cuba 
the state department said it stands by its estimate that the 
cuban troop presence numbers about 50000 it also disputed 
chitundas claim that 20000 cubans have acquired angolan 
citizenship 
final details of the agreement were being negotiated this week in 
the congolese capital of brazzaville chester crocker the state 
departments top official for african affairs is serving as 
mediator for the talks 
in addition to the withdrawal of cuban troops the accord is also 
aimed at bringing about independence and black majority rule in 
namibia a colony of south africa a treaty implementing the 
agreement is expected to be ready for signature in a few weeks 
the reagan administration has been providing assistance to unita 
since 1985 but chitundas remarks reflect what has been an 
undercurrent of uneasiness between the two allies 
south africa has been unitas main supplier but that role is 
expected to end once south african forces depart namibia as part of 
the independence process in the territory 
chitunda said unita has become increasingly selfsufficient and 
should be able to survive a south african aid suspension 
another shortcoming of the agreement chitunda said is that it 
does not provide for a process of national reconciliation in angola 
which has been plagued by civil war since independence in 1975 
he said that unitas main political objective is negotiations 
with angolan authorities leading to a process of national 
reconciliation and multiparty democracy 
we do not seek military superiority he said we do not 
seek military victory 
angolan officials have refused to hold national reconciliation 
talks calling instead on the unita rebels to take advantange of a 
government amnesty offer

two south african government ministers 
joined usmediated talks today aimed at wrapping up an interim 
agreement on a cuban troop withdrawal from angola and independence 
for southwest africa 
but defense minister magnus malan who flew to the congolese 
capital today with foreign minister pik botha said there was a 
serious hitch in the talks the independent south africa press 
association reported 
this is the time when the pitfalls start appearing malan was 
quoted as saying by the news agency the report did not elaborate 
one reported disagreement has involved south africas insistence 
on a reliable system for verifying the withdrawal of 50000 cuban 
troops supporting angolas marxist government in fighting a rebel 
war 
a statement issued in pretoria before their arrival in 
brazzaville said it was hoped the agreement would be signed today or 
saturday 
in any case further negotiations will be required after the 
signing of what is to be called the brazzaville protocol before a 
formal treaty is signed the formal agreement was to be signed in 
new york perhaps next month 
delegations from south africa angola and cuba arrived earlier 
this week for what was expected to be a final round of negotiations 
on the details of agreements ironed out in the past six months of 
usmediated talks 
angolas government is fighting a 13yearold war with the unita 
rebel movement 
unita receives assistance from south africa and the united 
states unita which has not been a party to the peace talks has 
vowed to continue fighting 
the protocol also calls for south africa to begin granting 
independence to southwest africa also known as namibia south 
africa has administered the territory for 73 years 
the weekly mail newspaper in johannesburg reported that unita 
forces have been moving from southern angola into namibia however 
the south african military has denied unita has any guerrilla 
fighters in namibia

a school reform measure for chicago that 
calls for the creation of local school councils and a new central 
board of education has overwhelmingly won the approval of the 
illinois general assembly 
final approval came on a 988 vote in the house late thursday 
the senate approved it 561 earlier in the evening 
i think that it is a good bill wellbalanced wellfounded 
and i am very hopeful that it will make significant change in the 
chicago school system said house speaker michael madigan 
the bill represents the general assemblys second effort on 
school reform a democraticdrafted bill was approved in july but 
was abandoned early in the fall session amid a partisan dispute over 
changes proposed by gov james r thompson 
drafted by a bipartisan legislative group the measure is 
designed to shift the balance of power in the school system by 
trimming the central school bureaucracy and creating local school 
councils with authority to appoint principals at each of the citys 
592 public schools 
principals will be given more authority over hiring and over 
attempts to improve the work of teachers who are deemed 
unsatisfactory 
the current 11member chicago board of education will be replaced 
with a sevenmember interim board to be appointed by the mayor a 
school board nominating commission will make recommendations to the 
mayor for a permanent 15member board 
the existing chicago school finance authority will serve as a 
watchdog over the reform effort and can suspend or fire any school 
board member or employee who doesnt comply with its directives 
lawmakers of both parties acknowledged the bill dealt primarily 
with the management of the school system but did not address such 
issues as overcrowding dropouts and early childhood education that 
require major funding increases

infantry units mutinied today at a 
large army base outside the capital and a rebel officer said the 
move was aimed at replacing the army chief and not civilian 
president raul alfonsin 
it was unclear how many soldiers were taking part in the 
insurrection and there were no reports of gunfire or injuries by 
early afternoon the campo de mayo base was the fourth military 
outpost reporting unrest in two days 
the army sent loyal troops to the base and reported other bases 
nationwide were calm vice president victor martinez convened 
emergency meetings to discuss the rebellion with cabinet ministers 
and military chiefs 
alfonsin is in new york to address the un general assembly 
the rebel officer who identified himself only as an aide to col 
mohamed ali seineldin said the revolt was not against alfonsin 
government 
our posture is one of absolute respect for the constitution 
he said in a telephone interview with the associated press he said 
the rebellion was aimed at toppling the army chief gen jose dante 
caridi 
seineldin is raising arms against the authorities of the force 
in a definitive attempt to restore the honor of the army and its 
historic role the officer said from the base 20 miles northeast 
of buenos aires 
the insurrection followed incidents thursday in which 53 coast 
guard men armed themselves and deserted their base and an captain 
attempted to incite infantry troops at la tablada west of buenos 
aires the defense ministry said the captain was arrested 
government officials had believed those incidents and another 
failed uprising at an army communications facility in city bell 25 
miles south of the capital had been isolated 
today they were treating the campo de mayo revolt as part of the 
same unrest and trying to make sure there were no other pockets of 
dissent 
the elite coast guard unit on thursday deserted their base in 
three trucks into which they loaded four light machine guns 200 
rifles 30 handguns and 100000 rounds of ammunition officials said 
the diario y noticias news agency reported the coast guard unit 
was inside the campo de mayo base today 
at the base no clashes were reported but rebels in combat gear 
put a heavy machine gun at the entrance to the military school and 
took in weapons 
the military action was denounced on all sides 
no action of this type is capable of threatening democracy 
said eduardo angeloz presidential candidate of alfonsins radical 
civic union 
carlos menem the opposition peronist party candidate in the may 
1988 elections said if it were necessary i dont doubt the 
argentine people would mobilize in defense of democracy 
elements within the army have complained about caridis 
leadership the selection of officers for promotion and retirement 
the military budget that under alfonsin has shrunk by half and pay 
that has not kept pace with 332 percent inflation 
officers also are unhappy about the resumption of trials against 
colleagues charged with human rights abuses in the crackdown on 
leftist subversion during the 197683 dictatorship 
the 1987 and 1988 uprisings led by lt col aldo rico now 
discharged and imprisoned were motivated to support fellow officers 
being prosecuted in civilian courts and reflected the unwillingness 
of colleagues who were called to testify 
during the dictatorship kidnappings bombings and assassinations 
by leftist groups were curtailed but at least 9000 argentines 
disappeared and were presumed executed by security forces a 
government commission reported 
in december 1985 five former junta members including former 
military presidents jorge videla and roberto viola were convicted 
in civilian court for crimes including kidnapping torture and 
murder

a federal judge today approved a 
precedentsetting order requiring the us department of energy to 
be subject to ohio environmental regulations in a 1 billion cleanup 
of the agencys fernald uranium processing plant 
ohio attorney general anthony celebrezze jr and sen john glenn 
dohio said the decree negotiated by federal and state attorneys 
is historic because it gives the state a courtenforceable order to 
pressure the energy department to clean up the plant celebrezze and 
glenn said it is the first such agreement they know of 
celebrezze and richard shank the ohio environmental protection 
agency director said ohio will use the order to force the energy 
department to clean up the plant and pay for its cost estimated at 
1 billion 
us district judge s arthur spiegel signed the agreement this 
morning in cincinnati celebrezze said 
the accord covers the feed materials production center in 
fernald which state officials blame for contamination of air and 
water at the 1050acre site 18 miles north of cincinnati the plant 
enriches uranium for nuclear power plants and for the governments 
nuclear research efforts 
the announcement of the agreement thursday came as the plants 
operator announced plans to lay off 350 workers because of decreased 
demand for its product 
glenn said fernalds problems date through 35 years of washington 
administrations and predecessors to the energy department as well 
as todays administration 
theres plenty of blame to go around said glenn who 
conducted a 1984 congressional hearing to help bring to public 
attention fernalds environmental problems of stored radioactive 
wastes and atmospheric releases of radioactive uranium oxide dust 
production at the 37yearold feed materials production center 
has been halted since the start of a strike by union workers oct 7 
glenn said the energy department estimates it will cost 175 
billion to clean up 17 federal nuclear sites during the next 35 
years he said only 300 million is budgeted for the job in the 
coming year 
todays agreement resulted from negotiations prompted by two ohio 
lawsuits filed in 1986 and 1987 against the energy department the 
agreement in the form of a court decree requires the energy 
department to pay more than 1 million as a result of the lawsuits 
the plant also is the subject of a 300 million class action in 
us district court in cincinnati on behalf of fernald neighbors who 
contend the plant has radioactively contaminated the environment 
posed a health hazard and ruined property values 
lisa crawford spokeswoman for fernald residents for 
environmental safety and health declined to comment specifically on 
the agreement until she reviews it 
but she said i want to see this thing written in stone 
etched in stone and its got to be enforceable 
jim alexander spokesman for the energy departments oak ridge 
tenn operations which include the fernald plant said the 
agreement is evidence of the energy departments intent to clean up 
fernald but is not an admission of wrongdoing 
joe la grone the energy departments manager of oak ridge 
operations said this week that the government will have spent 355 
million by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and work place safety 
efforts already under way at fernald 
the plant sits above the great miami river aquifer a water 
source for 2 million people the energy department has admitted the 
plant has emitted at least 300000 pounds of radioactive uranium 
dust into the atmosphere 
shank said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes from 
the plant could eventually pollute the aquifer water sampling has 
not revealed any notable contamination in regional public water 
supplies but monitoring will continue shank told reporters 
also thursday westinghouse materials co of ohio the plants 
operator said it would lay off 350 workers 
spokesman pete kelley said the layoffs will affect about 250 
hourly and about 100 salaried employees he said the layoffs were 
not prompted by a strike by the plants 625 union production 
workers which has idled the facility since oct 7 
some employees foresaw difficulties in cleaning up the 
37yearold plant if workers are laid off 
it will about destroy the place as far as cleanup goes said 
bob warren who has worked at the fernald plant for seven years 
if theyre being honest about cleaning up the plant then they 
wouldnt lay off 250 of the people who know how to do the cleanup 
said david day president of the atomic trades labor council which 
represents the 14 unions at the plant 
westinghouse laid off 70 employees at the plant in april because 
of declining orders for uranium and said then that more layoffs were 
likely 
fernald currently employs about 1500 people

a grand jury has blamed mismanagement in the 
citys department of licenses and inspections for at least six fires 
since 1984 that caused more than 23 million in damage and killed 
two people 
the agency is a bureaucracy that does not react to danger 
said district attorney ronald castille 
the philadelphia county grand jury condemned the city 
departments exclusive enforcement of the fire code but did not 
accuse any official of wrongdoing the grand jury said the system 
was at fault rather than the people 
the present system promotes inefficiency by permitting 
decisions without accountability ignoring advice from the fire 
department failing to follow up field inspector requests for action 
and failing to coordinate and utilize the information in its 
system the grand jury said thursday 
castille sent a letter to mayor w wilson goode urging him and 
the city council to strip the department of its fire code 
enforcement power and put the fire department in charge city 
officials had no response today 
william wolfe the assistant district attorney who handled the 
grand jury investigation said inspectors did their jobs on the six 
buildings that later burned but their reports went into the black 
hole of lampi where their supervisors did nothing 
the grand jury review of inspection and licensing agency 
practices covered six fires between may 1984 and december 1987 
including the nov 7 1984 explosion at the publicker distillery 
where two workers died and a ninealarm fire on may 3 1984 that 
caused an estimated 20 million in damage to 17 buildings 
the panel also recommended that criminal charges be filed against 
one building owner who allegedly ignored safety citations and the 
owner of a company that installs fire alarm and sprinkler systems 
for allegedly illegally obtaining an occupancy permit

winstonsalem nc ap the record buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
has stirred dreams of big stock profits and hopes that the companys 
corporate headquarters would return to this tobacco city but it 
also brought fears of layoffs 
i think the general feeling is one of uncertainty fred 
nordenholz president of the winstonsalem chamber of commerce said 
thursday there are lots of mixed feelings about whats 
happening 
the food and tobacco giant was auctioned off to buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co late wednesday in a 2453 billion 
deal valued at about 109 a share in cash and securities 
that is virtually double the stocks price before management 
started a bidding war six weeks ago and represents a big windfall 
for this city analysts estimate that about 9000 people in the area 
plus local trusts foundations and retirement plans own stock now 
worth a little more than 2 billion 
at windsor jewelers in downtown winstonsalem lois simon said 
she has already noticed an influx of potential new customers who 
appear to be looking for ways to spend the proceeds they will get 
from the sale of their stock 
these are definitely not typical of the clientele that would be 
pricing our emeralds and diamonds she said 
however chamber of commerce chairman john davis said stories of 
productionline workers becoming millionaires were a bit 
overstated 
there are some people who are suddenly quartermillionaires on 
paper anyway he said 
some local businessmen hope rjr will return its corporate 
headquarters which were shifted to atlanta last year to 
winstonsalem bringing jobs and prestige back as well the company 
has kept its rj reynolds tobacco co subsidiary the nations 
second largest cigarette maker based here throughout 
expectations of any windfalls are tempered because kohlberg 
kravis will use unprecedented amounts of borrowed money to acquire 
rjr locals expect belttightening measures to enable the company to 
pay off its massive debt which could include layoffs even in the 
hugely profitable tobacco business 
some people are going to have greater personal wealth than ever 
before and thats balanced by a certain amount of anxiety about 
where the companys headed and whats going to happen to their 
careers nordenholz said 
davis who is also a managing partner of the investment firm 
alex brown and sons said the city could emerge in better shape 
when the financial smoke clears 
tobacco is fairly recessionresistant as is most of the food 
business he said things may be tight for a year 18 months 
but profits have been in the 20 to 25 percent range what are 
you going to do lay people off because youre making more money it 
doesnt work that way 
rick weddle director of winstonsalem business inc said 
layoffs could actually help his firm lure other industry to the 
area a local unemployment rate of about 3 percent has left the area 
short of skilled labor he said 
i am probably one of the few people alive who sees opportunity 
in employment reductions he said 
many local shareholders may seek to spend some of their sudden 
windfall business owners said 
davis said other shareholders are looking to reinvest their 
profits 
wade spache a maintenance technician at rj reynolds said he 
sold some of his stock earlier at 84 a share far below the 
buyouts 109 value but way above the stocks price of roughly 56 
before the bidding war began oct 20 the stock fell 125 thursday 
to close at 9175 and dropped another 75 cents this morning to 91 
i just wanted to be on the safe side he said i didnt 
want everything i had in speculation

a recently sluggish wall street received a burst 
of energy from the record bidding contest for rjr nabisco inc and 
its bracing for even more takeover activity before congress 
reconvenes next year 
the takeover activity has lent a real spark of life to a market 
which otherwise would be in the doldrums said ac moore 
director of equity research at argus research 
theres been a lot of things going on here but theres nothing 
nearly as big said eldon grimm a senior vice president at birr 
wilson amp co who has been trading stock for nearly 60 years its 
livened up the place 
still reeling from the october 1987 stock market crash and 
worried about higher interest rates a sluggish economy and the 
dollar many investors had shied away from stocks in recent weeks 
but their interest was revived when the rjr bidding war erupted 
in late october amid a wave of other multibilliondollar takeover 
attempts of big companies 
late wednesday buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
emerged the apparent victor in the bidding war when the companys 
board of directors accepted its 2453 billion offer over a slightly 
larger proposal by rjr management 
some of the biggest winners so far are rjr stockholders who have 
seen their shares more than double in value from a year ago from 
43 to 91 at midmorning today they stand to reap tens of billions 
of dollars in profits once the 109ashare merger is consummated 
then there are the investment bankers such as shearson lehman 
hutton inc and salomon brothers inc whose business had slowed 
since last years stock market crash they will receive substantial 
fees for helping the rjr bidders put their proposals together 
and there are lucrative fees for the commercial banks lending 
money to finance the deal and for the battery of lawyers providing 
contractual advice the new owners and their investors also are 
likely to reap big profits once the consumer products giant is 
restructured 
among the losers have been holders of rjrs 5 billion in 
corporate bonds which slipped 20 percent in market value during 
recent weeks what troubles bondholders is that the buyout will be 
financed primarily by borrowed money mainly through new issues of 
highyield highrisk junk bonds that will give the company 
higher levels of debt than traditionaly have been considered prudent 
many other outstanding corporate issues have been hurt by the 
takeover frenzy but more money has gone into less volatile treasury 
bonds particularly shortterm issues 
other recent big takeover offers include the 126 billion merger 
of kraft inc with phillip morris cos and british conglomerate 
grand metropolitan plcs 5 billionplus takeover attempt of 
pillsbury co the stock of those target companies also has risen in 
value 
michale metz a technical analyst with oppenheimer amp co and 
other analysts predict more giant takeovers offers may surface 
before congress reconvenes next year and considers how to limit 
buyouts as many lawmakers have threatened to do 
i think that there is mounting pressure from various circles to 
curtail activity of this sort all this money is changing hands 
but in the end were not becoming any more productive or creative 
said moore until washington takes action though i imagine any 
company is up for grabs 
under this scenario share prices of these future targets and 
others could be driven up even further 
and as more and more companies are bought and taken private that 
will mean less stock available to the public which also could boost 
prices 
according to federal reserve figures the amount of available 
stock has shrunk by about 75 billion in each of the past two years 
moore predicts that by the end of this year another 100 billion in 
equity will be gone or about 3 percent of the 33 trillion 
outstanding 
so where will all this money be reinvested 
metz predicted the old conservative investor will probably be 
buying treasury bills and cds with it theyre still wary after the 
1987 crash others will buy more stock and look for more profits

here is a message from president reagan on the 
jewish holiday of hanukkah which begins sunday as released by the 
white house friday 
i am pleased to send holiday greetings to the jewish community 
during this season of hanukkah 5749 
of the many messages found in the hanukkah story the one that 
has always inspired me most is this with a strong faith in the 
almighty nothing is impossible and without the help of our 
creator we labor in vain 
when the maccabees vanquished the syrians and recaptured the holy 
temple they found only a small portion of the pure oil needed to 
light the menorah and rededicate the sacred place men of less faith 
would have despaired but the leaders of that time knew that trust 
in the almighty would see them through their determination was of 
course rewarded and today many centuries later the miracle of 
the lights is celebrated with undiminished wonder thanks and joy 
this is the last occasion i will have as president to send warm 
wishes to the jewish people on a holiday it is my hope that this 
festival will renew and strengthen the spirit of jewish families 
everywhere just as it lifts the hearts of all who look to the care 
and mercy of our eternal father may he bless you and grant you his 
abiding peace

five cubans with criminal records left 
the united states today for their homeland in the first deportation 
of mariel boat people since cuban prisoners rioted last year to 
protest an agreement to return them to cuba 
a us marshals service airplane carrying about 50 people took 
off from the birmingham airport at 1055 am security was tight 
with the five cubans shackled in handcuffs and guarded by armed 
agents led one by one to the plane 
they earlier had been taken to the airport from the federal 
prison at talladega where they had been held pending a final ruling 
on deportation 
the flight had been scheduled for thursday but was delayed when 
cuba asked for more time to prepare to receive the five three of 
whom lost a series of court fights in their effort to avoid going 
home 
the supreme court by a vote of 81 today cleared the way for 
the deportations justice thurgood marshall was the lone vote to 
grant an emergency request by the three to remain in america there 
was no other comment by the justices 
on thursday us supreme court justice anthony m kennedy denied 
without comment an emergency application from the three for a stay 
of repatriation the day before the 11th us circuit court in 
atlanta also had rejected their plea 
the other two cubans ticketed for the return flight did not 
oppose deportation 
us district judge uw clemon earlier in the week rejected an 
appeal by the three that he overturn their deportation clemon is 
expected to rule in the next few days in the cases of 10 others who 
also have been held at the federal correctional institution at 
talladega 60 miles east of birmingham 
the 15 were among 114 of the cubans placed at talladega after the 
prison riots 
last years uprising by cuban prisoners at federal lockups in 
atlanta and oakdale la was sparked by an agreement for some of 
the 1980 mariel boatlift people to be returned to cuba 
in 1980 125000 people some of them convicts or mentally ill 
sailed illegally from mariel cuba to this country 
the justice department began a repatriation program in 1984 and 
sent back 201 cubans before cuban president fidel castro stopped the 
effort in 1985 
last year he agreed to accept 2746 cuba natives with the prison 
riots coming on the heels of that agreement 
the united states wants to return as many as 2500 marielitos 
either as excludable aliens or those convicted of serious crimes 
in this country attorneys for the inmates claim they will be 
persecuted if sent home 
the three who were turned down by the courts this week are miguel 
beitiasocarraz 28 who pleaded guilty to seconddegree burglary 
onel calzadogarlobo 43 convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual 
assault charges involving a 13yearold girl and rene maurinoliva

president roh taewoos plan to restore 
credibility in his administration by revamping his cabinet and party 
has snagged in the selection process officials said friday 
in other developments the oppositioncontrolled national 
assembly issued a subpoena friday ordering former president chun 
doohwan to testify for parliamentary inquiries into corruption and 
irregularities it was not known if chun received it 
hundreds of protesters again took to the streets demanding 
punishment of chun who apologized for corruption and repression 
during his government and went into selfimposed internal exile 
officials in the governing democratic justice party said roh 
plans to replace several dozen key leaders as quickly as possible in 
what they say would be the most extensive shakeup since he took 
office in february 
roh has promised to remove the vestiges of the chun government to 
help soothe public furor over his repressive rule 
but one party source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
roh was having trouble finding fresh and competent faces without 
military background or past service in the chun government 
the president has a limited pool of senior party officials able 
to take on the responsibilities of a high ranking government job 
the sources said 
party infighting has also delayed the new appointments which 
originally were to be announced this week sources said 
among the most significant cabinet changes would be the 
replacement of incumbent officials who have military backgrounds 
with competent civilians 
past authoritarian governments have been dominated by former army 
generals opposition parties have persistently demanded civilian 
control of the government 
chun who resigned in february went into rural exile nov 23 
after publicly apologizing for corruption human rights violations 
and other abuses during his seven years in office 
chun has denied any personal wrongdoing but a dozen of his 
associates and family members including two brothers have been 
convicted or charged with taking bribes and embezzling government 
funds 
roh has asked the nation to forgive chun and promised speedy 
democratic reforms which include the govenment shakeup but rohs 
proposals failed to satisfy dissidents and radical students who have 
staged demonstrations demanding chuns arrest and punishment 
on friday about 200 students armed with iron rods and firebombs 
attacked a building of goverment prosecutors demanding chuns 
arrest the attack caused no injuries but shattered dozens of 
windows 
clashes also broke out in seoul at yonsei and seoul national 
universities between hundreds of students and riot police students 
hurled scores of firebombs shouting arrest chun doohwan punish 
roh taewoo no injuries were reported

us defense secretary frank carlucci 
said friday a new push to get nato allies to shoulder more of the 
defense burden should stall any efforts in congress to withdraw 
american troops from western europe 
he praised defense ministers at a twoday meeting of the north 
atlantic treaty organization for taking the remarkable step of 
approving a report critical of some for not doing more for the 
western alliance 
they unanimously approved a report that makes clear that some 
of their nations are not bearing a fair share of the common defense 
burden carlucci told a news conference 
the 79page report made public thursday was natos effort to 
defuse the potentially divisive issue of burdensharing 
us congressional critics contend the allies are not pulling 
their weight in nato some have raised the possibility the united 
states might withdraw some of its 326000 troops stationed in europe 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former west german 
defense minister told reporters the study sent a signal that this 
is not a matter of the united states versus the rest of the 
alliance this is a joint alliance effort 
carlucci said the work must continue as long as cognress 
perceives we are dealing with this issue fairly there will not be 
efforts per se to reduce our troop strength in europe he said 
we must remember we are not in europe as a philanthropic 
gesture to the europeans he said we are there because of our 
collective security 
carlucci also said his recommendation for a 2 percent increase 
after adjustment for inflation in the 1990 us defense budget 
would allow for us troops to remain in europe 
if congress pressed for zerogrowth budgets for the pentagon he 
said 116 billion would have to be sliced from spending over five 
years 
in a final statement the ministers said they were encouraged by 
signs of change in the soviet union since they could lead to 
improved and progressively more stable eastwest relations 
but the ministerss statement added we have as yet seen no 
evidence of relaxation in the scale of the soviet unions military 
effort 
moscow it said earmarks about 15 percent to 17 percent of its 
total economic output for defense spending nearly three times the 
us level 
the ministers also said they agreed to provide additional money 
in the 1991 and 1992 nato budgets to relocate the united states 
401st tactical fighter wing from spain to italy the move is 
expected to cost about 800 million 
spain has said the 72 f16 fighter jets must leave its territory 
by 1991 as part of a drive to reduce the us military presence 
there 
ministers from 15 of natos 16 member nations met at headquarters 
in brussels as part of the defense planning committee france does 
not belong to the committee 
foreign ministers from all 16 nations gather in brussels late 
next week for a regularly scheduled meeting

wright told reporters before a private meeting with dukakis his 
future is not behind him it is ahead of him

gubernatorial duties

kerry and had lunch with texas sen lloyd bentsen who was the no 2

expected dukakis to play a very major role in the party 
aides said dukakis also would meet briefly with washingtonbased 
campaign aides to thank them for their help

bush in a spirit of partnership cooperation

quoting bush transition aides as saying medicare and other 
entitlement programs could face spending cuts as part of a 
deficitreduction plan

the communist party newspaper on friday 
gave lech walesa credit for being conciliatory during his tv debate 
with an official union leader but it said the solidarity leader 
usually takes a different tone 
the 43minute debate wednesday night with official unions chief 
alfred miodowicz was the first time walesa had appeared on polish 
television in five years and the first time he was ever given such 
a forum to discuss his views at length 
supporters believed walesa took the offensive and won the debate 
easily but the official press continued to avoid any judgments on 
who was the victor 
miodowicz in an interview published friday with the flag of 
youth newspaper said in answer to a question about why he did not 
speak more aggressively that the idea of this meeting was to get 
closer not confrontation as the host i felt obliged to make my 
style of the debate conform to this 
we did not indulge in a verbal fight which would bring disgrace 
on ourselves he said what matters in the end is the future of 
polish trade unions and not who won more points 
he also said he would support a proposal made by walesa during 
the debate for further televised debates between experts on various 
problems from both the official unions and representatives of 
opposing viewpoints 
i propose twice a month discussions about the problems of 
workers he said 
meanwhile the party newspaper trybuna ludu said the fact that 
the debate could be televised in itself proved that authorities are 
not marking time in making reforms 
one should note with appreciation and even satisfaction that 
walesas address contained several statements and theses in a 
conciliatory tone said a trybuna ludu political commentator 
by rejecting anarchy or destruction and stating that the 
territory of an enterprise should not be an arena for political 
struggle lech walesa presented himself in a different way that in 
other times said commentator ryszard drecki 
millions of poles on wednesday listened to a lech walesa who 
was rather conciliatory calm and leaning toward agreement not many 
people know however the speech he delivered last sunday an address 
unequivocally confrontational did some change occur in his views in 
three days 
the official press had criticized hostile remarks attacking 
miodowicz allegedly made by walesa on sunday but walesa has denied

friday 
west germany will abandon more than half its maneuvers involving 
more than 2000 troops but increase smaller excercises to allay 
environmental and public complaints said west german defense 
minister rupert scholz the switch also would be more 
costeffective he said 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said scholz stressed the 
impending reliance on smaller excercises was meant to increase the 
effectiveness of west german forces 
it was not described as a reduction in overall military 
excercises said woerner 
scholz said allies had reacted positively when hee wont be affected 
but observers said large disruptive 
maneuvers by other nato troops might be seen in an increasingly bad

force than expected a defense spokeswoman saidy 
martin oneill the opposition labor party spokesman on defense 
matters called for an inquiry at the site 40 miles southwest of 
london 
the veil of secrecy which surrounds activities at 
establishments like burghfield has to be lifted when the public and 
the surrounding area have been disturbed and shocked by an explosion 
such as this he said 
bruce kent of the campaign for nuclear disarmament said it is 
incredible that conventional explosives should be destroyed by 
burning in the middle of a nuclear bomb factory

five armed soviets who hijacked a busload 
of schoolchildren in the soviet union and released them in exchange 
for a plane out of the country surrendered today after landing in 
israel with a hostage crew 
the ilyushin76 plane landed at bengurion international airport 
near tel aviv at 545 pm 1045 am est israel army radio said 
the plane was allowed to land after officials received a request 
from the soviet union 
its all over an army spokesman told reporters about 10 
minutes after eight people were seen leaving the aircraft there was 
no word on whether the eight crew members who were freed had been 
injured during the ordeal 
army officials said that shortly after the plane landed two men 
and a woman came out of the plane and asked for a translator they 
then began negotiations in which the hijackers surrendered a gun 
the standoff ended a short time later 
staterun israel radio said the hijackers who were described as 
four russians and an armenian with criminal backgrounds had large 
sums of money with them 
the five had hijacked a school bus with 30 children aboard in the 
soviet union and traded their hostages for the plane and about 2 
million rubles about 33 million worth of ransom said israels 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron 
one of the soviet crew members flight engineer yuri nikolai 
yermilov said the five wanted to fly out of the soviet union 
thats why they kidnapped the bus with the children 
transportation minister chaim korfu told reporters the soviets 
had requested extradition of the hijackers 
we know there are no children aboard korfu said there are 
five hijackers four men and a woman and eight crew members 
army radio said there had been constant contacts between israeli 
and soviet airport officials and some diplomatic contacts as well 
it said the hijackers had not asked to land specifically in 
israel but only included it on a list of possible destinations 
reporters were kept in the terminal building and could only see 
the movements of vehicles on the darkened runway once the plane 
landed 
earlier radio monitors said that tel avivs control tower had 
contacted the hijacked plane can i talk with the hijacker a 
controller asked no the pilot responded 
army radio said the plane at first headed toward pakistan and 
iraq but then changed course and flew toward israel 
in moscow an official said the incident began thursday in the 
city of ordzhonikidze in southern russia 
a group of armed bandits hijacked a bus with 30 schoolchildren 
and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad albert 
vlasov head of the soviet news agency novosti told a news 
conference 
in order to save the children and the teacher a decision was 
made to give a plane vlasov said he said the hostages were 
released unharmed 
in a later report the soviet news agency tass said the hijackers 
included four men and one woman armed with three pistols and an 
automatic rifle 
the hijackers demanded a huge sum of money and an airliner for 
a flight out of the country tass said 
the bus was taken to the airport in ordzhonikidze but the 
hijackers could not find a big enough plane there so they took the 
bus and hostages to neighboring mineralniye vodi where they boarded 
the plane tass said 
it was not clear from the report whether the children were taken 
onto the aircraft and then released or whether they were freed as 
the hijackers got onto the plane 
vlasov said the hijackers wanted to go to israel south africa or 
pakistan the last reported hijacking in the soviet union occurred 
in march when members of a family musical group from irkutsk in 
siberia hid guns and explosives inside their instruments and seized 
an aeroflot jet en route to leningrad 
the plane landed near leningrad after the pilot said he was 
running low on fuel an army assault team stormed the plane and the 
hijackers opened fire and set off a bomb five of the hijackers 
died three passengers and a flight attendant also were killed

federal agents eradicated roughly 60 percent of 
the marijuana grown in national forests during 1988 while sharply 
increasing the number of cultivation arrests and plant seizures a 
us forest service official said friday 
at the same time the number of physical assaults against agents 
and members of the public in cases related to marijuana growing was 
down but the number of sites that were boobytrapped were up 
according to forest service figures 
the statistics also indicate that growers now apparently are 
concentrating their efforts on more potent forms of marijuana such 
as sinsemilla and on hybrids that produce more pounds of saleable 
marijuana per plant 
the crackdown on drug growers in the forests has become one of 
the agencys top priorities and agents are armed with increased 
enforcement powers and more money than in the past 
in essence 1988 is the first full year in which we have been 
able to see the sucess of our efforts said ed few the forest 
services assistant branch chief for law enforcement we now have 
policies and strategies in operation to attack this problem 
few said federal agents wiped out an estimated 60 percent of the 
marijuana grown in national forests in 1988 compared with an 
estimated 40 percent of the crop in 1987 
he said agents and rangers seized more than 340000 plants in 
1988 compared with 255000 plants in 1987 
the estimated street value of the plants seized in 1988 was more 
than 12 billion said few adding that the forest service 
considered that a conservative estimate 
few said the agency was comfortable with it estimates which 
are based on intelligence from field agents and surveys of marijuana 
plantations that were harvested before being detected 
it would be nice to get 100 percent of the crop few said 
but we would be foolish to predict that the objective is to seize 
enough so that is becomes apparent to the grower that it is not 
costeffective for them to use national forest lands 
few said that while once agents used to find plantations with 
4000 or 5000 plants in a forest clearing most sites now contain 
about 100 plants that are growing near other trees or brush 
the number of marijuanagrowing arrests made by the forest 
service was up almost 400 percent from 134 nationwide in 1987 to 
527 this year few said 
weve dealt with the problem to some extent over the past 10 
years handling it as a misdemeanor crime and concentrating on 
eradication few said the 1986 drug act gave us the tools we 
needed to do the job 
drug growers now face felony charges and agents now are allowed 
to pursue suspects even after they leave federal lands 
this year also was the first year in which the forest service 
received the funds for drug enforcement progams it had requested a 
total of 32 million few said 
the number of physical assaults on agents or members of the 
general public using national forests dropped from 19 in 1987 to 11 
in 1988 while the number of sites found with potentially lethal 
boobytraps grew from 83 in 1987 to 116 in 1988 
few said there was a dramatic increase in the number of 
marijuana plantations found that exclusively contained the more 
potent sinsemilla plants with 1255 such sites found in 1987 and 
2268 such sites found this year 
he said the street value of sinsemilla can be almost twice that 
of less potent types

a homeless man was arrested today for arson 
and police said he was a suspect in at least one of 10 fires that 
broke out in an innercity neighborhood overnight destroying eight 
buildings 
tips from witnesses led to the arrest of booker t washington 
jr 46 who was picked up in the neighborhood while attempting to 
drink from a container of gasoline said police spokeswoman yvonne 
bechet 
he was booked with simple arson and taken to charity hospital for 
observation 
he was one of the citys homeless living in an abandoned 
car said bechet 
no one was injured in the fires which occurred mainly in vacant 
residences a passerby said he pulled two elderly women from what 
was believed to be the only occupied building eight buildings were 
destroyed and at least six others were heavily damaged 
washington was booked for a onealarm fire that broke out just 
before 8 pm thursday about the same time most of the citys 
firefighters were working on a sixalarm blaze that razed much of a 
nearby city block said fire department spokesman bob whitman 
police and fire officials said washington may be linked to the 
other fires also 
fire superintendent william mccrossen said there was no doubt 
in my mind that the blazes were arson 
police said a witness reported seeing a man running with a 
gasoline can just as the flames started leaping from the first fire 
which swept through six houses on one street two more fires 
engulfed an abandoned bar and a vacant house respectively and 
seven more broke out over the next few hours all but one within 
three or four blocks of the first fires whitman said 
mark dandey said he was in a nearby restaurant when some children 
told him there were people in one of the burning buildings 
i smelled smoke and i ran out and there were two young kids 
saying fire fire so then we go over the house and tried to 
kick the door down after i kicked the door down they had two old 
ladies in the house and i pulled them out dandey said

atlantis and its crew of five 
military astronauts rocketed into orbit today on a secret mission 
that reportedly will deploy a powerful radar satellite to spy on the 
soviet union and guide the new stealth bomber 
the shuttle blasted away from its seaside launch pad at 93034 
am est with less than 90 seconds to go in the launch window 
after a blackedout countdown that was delayed by the same weather 
worries that had forced a postponement on thursday 
the spaceship etched a fiery path in the sky as it headed 
straight up on a northward path a course that will allow the 500 
million satellite it releases to fly over 80 percent of the soviet 
union on its intelligencegathering mission 
a very clean ascent for atlantis there were no problems 
encountered on the way to orbit said brian welch the commentator 
at mission control in houston 
an hour later welch reported the vehicle is in very clean 
shape there are no systems problems whatever to report 
with those words the defense department clamped a security lid 
on the flight cutting off the normal nasa commentary on the mission 
and the broadcast of crewtoground conversations 
only two further announcements were planned during the flight 
the first about four hours after launch was a brief report that 
the crew of atlantis is go for orbit operations all crew members 
are doing well and all systems of the orbiter are performing 
satisfactorily 
the second announcement will be an alert that atlantis will land 
exactly 24 hours later at edwards air force base calif the flight 
is expected to last three or four days 
air force secretary edward c aldridge who observed the liftoff 
from the control center thanked the launch team saying the 
payload was extremely important and you did a great job all around 
added nasa administrator james c fletcher you gave us some 
heart failure there toward the end but we got it off my thanks 
for another great job 
atlantis liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third 
allmilitary mission was witnessed by a smallerthanusual crowd of 
a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides 
the launch had been delayed 24 hours by strong winds along the 
shuttles flight path strong shifting winds five miles up also 
threatened todays liftoff but weather balloon data read late in 
the countdown showed they were acceptable 
new doubts cropped up even at the 31second mark when nasa again 
stopped the clock briefly because of concern about weather at a 
transatlantic landing site in spain 
nasa had said the launch could occur in a period starting at 632 
am and ending at 932 am 
two minutes eight seconds after liftoff the flight passed a 
critical milestone when the two solid fuel booster rockets burned 
out and jettisoned on schedule falling into the atlantic ocean 
the failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of 
challenger and loss of its sevenperson crew on jan 28 1986 
with the boosters gone atlantis three liquidfuel main engines 
burned for an additional 6 minutes and propelled the ship into an 
orbit more than 100 miles high 
the astronauts who boarded the spacecraft about 5 am spent 4 
hours lying on their backs in their bulky escape suits awaiting the 
decision that finally sent them aloft 
air force meteorologists were watching an area between 25000 
feet and 28000 feet where there were shear winds of varying speeds 
and directions that could break up the shuttle as it roared upward 
toward orbit 
the speed of the wind is not as much a factor as their 
direction and the shuttles direction of flight nasa commentator 
hugh harris said 
the fueling of atlantis was halted for about an hour at 1230 
am while a minor leak was fixed on an oxygen tank on a fuel 
farm near the pad 
had todays launch been postponed nasa would probably have 
waited until sunday to try again policy forbids putting work crews 
through the grueling launch schedule three days in a row 
the crew commander navy cmdr robert l gibson is no stranger 
to launch postponements as commander of columbia on the 24th 
shuttle mission in 1986 he experienced a record seven postponements 
and had to board the ship six times before finally lifting off 
the other crew members are air force lt col guy s gardner the 
pilot col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross of the air 
force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity say the crew will 
release a giant 18ton satellite named lacrosse that is capable of 
gathering extremely sharp radar images of military targets in the 
soviet union and eastern europe 
the information should help us intelligence officials verify 
soviet compliance with arms control treaties and serve as a radar 
eye for the new b2 stealth bomber the sources said 
defense officials contend the secrecy is necessary to make it 
more difficult for soviet satellites and spy ships off the florida 
coast to monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
however the soviets have indicated through the official news 
agency tass thrst postchallenger 
flight

george bush shook hands with defeated 
democratic rival michael dukakis today as the massachusetts governor 
arrived for a private fencemending session that the presidentelect 
had suggested 
bush and dukakis had no words for the throng of reporters on hand 
before going into the vice presidents residence at the naval 
observatory a minute later sen dan quayle the future occupant of 
the house emerged and left in his limousine presumably after 
greeting dukakis inside 
earlier bush warmly greeted onetime republican rival pat 
robertson at the white house hailing the way expolitical foes can 
be postelection friends and accepting robertsons praise for 
cabinet appointments so far 
bush turned aside questions about further appointments in a less 
cheerful manner criticizing early premature needless 
speculation 
he also met with john swan the premier of bermuda and was to 
meet this evening with another foreign leader argentine president 
raul alfonsin in whose country military units were reported to have 
mutinied today at a large army base outside the capital of buenos 
aires 
swan and alfonsin are the fourth and fifth heads of state meeting 
with bush since his election nov 8 
at the white house robertson told reporters he gave bush a 
private message from the foreign minister of south africa 
the time has come to recognize that the south african 
government needs a little encouragement said robertson who 
returned last week from south africa he is a longtime critic of 
sanctions against that nations whiteruled apartheid government 
robertson said bush told him he would like to see jesse jackson 
and other american black leaders visit south africa and explore 
firsthand whats happening because there have been some significant 
changes over the last 10 years 
robertson cited the governments movement of nelson mandela from 
prison to a halfway house the commutation of the death sentences of 
the sharpeville 6 and other steps they have broken down a great 
deal of institutionalized and social apartheid and i think it would 
be nice to just say youre on the right track and wed like to 
encourage you a little bit robertson said 
bush who was not available to reporters after the robertson 
meeting also was hosting 20 evangelical leaders at his home friday 
night 
before the meeting with robertson bush was asked if he had a 
place in his cabinet for the television evangelist just good 
friend robertson interjected 
some people dont understand the campaign bush said they 
think that when you run against someone in a campaign that that 
injures friendship its wonderful the way the american politcal 
system works 
robertson told bush that in the transition period he had played 
it as well as you possibly could i think its an 
extraordinarily competent cabinet so far 
bush declined to say when he would appoint his defense secretary 
or other top officials the more i answer your questions on the 
subject that needs to be treated in an orderly procedural fashion 
the more i add to that which i dont like which is a lot of early 
premature needless speculation and so im not going to do it 
bush told reporters 
we are way ahead of where other presidentselect have been and 
im going to stay ahead and so all i say is stay tuned and please 
dont press me said bush 
he paid tribute to retiring rep jack kemp of new york another 
erstwhile rival at a dinner thursday night 
bush who reviled dukakis during the campaign as another 
liberal governor coming out of nowhere who will take us back to the 
bad old days made clear immediately after the election that he 
hoped to bury the hatchet as quickly as possible 
dukakis for his part had spoken during the campaign of sleaze 
among top reagan administration officials drawing strong retorts 
from bush after saying theres an old greek saying the fish 
rots from the head first 
steve crawford a dukakis spokesman said the massachusetts 
governor planned to raise with bush a number of the issues he 
campaigned on 
education health care day care drugs housing and other 
issues that he felt were important during the campaign and still 
feels are important crawford said 
in a meeting thursday bush told senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine that he will take the lead in proposing a 
solution to the budget deficit as democrats have insisted 
that is exactly what i intend to do after jan 20 bush said 
bush also said he wont be rushed into making cabinet 
appointments despite persistent news media speculation that may be 
troubling to prospects such as john tower the former texas senator 
keeping a long vigil for the pentagon opening

pesticide residues in food do not pose a health 
hazard even though more than 3 percent of the food tested by the 
government had illegal amounts or types of pesticides the food and 
drug administration said friday 
many seem to believe that we are consuming large and harmful 
amounts of pesticide residues fda commissioner frank e young 
said in a statement thats a myth and another myth is that any 
residue no matter how little or how legal is harmful 
however a report by the agriculture departments office of 
inspector general said the government system to assure that meat is 
free of dangerous chemicals has broken down 
predictable inspections and ineffective followup methods hamper 
federal efforts to detect chemical contamination trace it back to 
its source and determine if violations are continuing acording to 
the report a copy of which was obtained by the des moines register 
the fda said friday that less than 1 percent of the fresh foods 
tested show more pesticides than allowed by federal guidelines an 
additional 3 percent had illegal pesticide residues which the 
agency called technical violations such as an otherwise approved 
pesticide residue being found on the wrong crop 
the actual residues found are almost always much lower than the 
tolerances allow young said furthermore residues usually will 
disappear or decrease during processing washing and cooking

the decision by soviet authorities to permit armed 
hijackers to fly out of the country friday marked a sharp reversal 
from the two previous known air piracies both of which ended in 
fatal shootouts 
but the foreign ministrys statement that the decision was made 
to save the children was consistent with soviet tradition and 
policy that focuses considerable official attention on the care and 
upbringing of the nations young 
the five hijackers seized a busload of children in the city of 
ordzhonikidze in southern russia then traded the hostages for a 
plane out of the country they surrendered after landing in israel 
with a hostage crew of eight 
before mikhail s gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 
incidents such as hijackings rarely were mentioned by the tightly 
controlled official press 
the labor newspaper trud reported in july that there have been 
more than 50 attempted hijackings in the soviet union in the past 15 
years few of them were reported by the soviet media 
in march an 11member family musical troupe from siberia seized 
an aeroflot jet in march with 76 passengers aboard over the urals 
and demanded to be flown to london according to published reports 
authorities ordered the plane to land at a small airstrip near 
leningrad tricking the hijackers into thinking they were landing in 
nearby finland 
the hijackers shot a stewardess when they realized they had been 
duped the reports said and after two hours of negotiations a 
police assault team stormed the plane prompting the hijackers to 
detonate a bomb that destroyed the aircraft 
nine people including five of the hijackers three passengers 
and the stewardess were killed nineteen people were seriously 
wounded 
the other reported incident took place sept 20 1986 in the 
ural mountains city of ufa when armed members of the internal 
security forces hijacked an airliner media reports at the time said 
five people including two hijackers were killed when authorities 
stormed the plane the other perpetrators were tried and sentenced 
the report said but few details were provided 
air piracy is a capital offense in the soviet union 
in one of the best known cases soviet authorities arrested 26 
people in connection with an abortive attempt on june 17 1970 by 
11 soviet jews to board and hijack an aircraft in leningrad to fly 
to sweden 
several of those arrested were refuseniks or jews who have been 
refused permission to emigrate the 26 were convicted in four 
separate trials two were sentenced to death with their sentences 
later commuted and the rest received lengthy prison terms 
the same year two soviet planes were hijacked to turkey in 
separate incidents in 1977 two were commandeered and forced to fly 
to sweden 
four unsuccessful attempts to hijack soviet airliners were 
reported between 1961 and 1966

police answering a report that a man was 
holding his girlfriend hostage mistakenly surrounded the house next 
door then shooed the man away when he tried to surrender police 
and witnesses said 
i didnt know what was coming down said the man jessie 
cobb 37 i came out and they started cussing me and told me to go 
back inside i thought they were going to pull a rambo on me 
both he and his girlfriend joyce gaines said later that the 
incident was an argument that had been blown out of proportion she 
denied that she told police by telephone that cobb had a knife as 
police said later 
no arrests were made 
police were called to the house wednesday by a neighbor who said 
cobb was holding ms gaines there against her will 
but because of a mixup the police special operations team 
surrounded the house next door when cobb tried to surrender 
officers frantically waived him back inside thinking he was just a 
curious neighbor and telling him he was in danger 
police sgt john bowman said the confusion intensified when ms 
gaines told hostage negotiators by telephone that she could hear 
officers knocking on the door 
she apparently was hearing the officers rather heavyhanded 
knocking on the house next door but our negotiators didnt know 
that bowman said 
a witness johnny walker said he tried to tell police they were 
at the wrong house but officers told him they knew what they were 
doing 
this old boy in the meantime had come out two or three times to 
give himself up and the tactical squad ran him back in the house 
saying he could get hurt walker said 
bowman said officers were embarrassed by the incident but 
officers handled the situation the best way they could with the 
information available 
you can armchair quarterback this thing to death it happened 
and the comic overtones are not unknown to us bowman said at any 
rate he said no one got hurt

southern californians just suffered through 
one of the worst smog seasons of the decade air quality officials 
said 
ozone levels in the south coast air basin surpassed federal 
standards on 172 of the 184 days of this past smog season which 
runs from may 1 to oct 31 that number was exceeded only twice in 
this decade 
ozone levels were above federal standards on 180 days in 1981 and 
173 days in 1984 
the smog season is the time of year when southern californias 
temperatures are the hottest and its air the most stagnant factors 
that contribute strongly in the creation of air pollution 
ozone is formed in sunlight by the reaction of nitrogen oxides a 
product of combustion with certain hydrocarbon compounds such as 
gasoline vapors and solvents 
ozone lowers resistance to infection exacerbates chronic 
respiratory illness and can cause permanent lung damage in people 
exposed to high levels over a period of several years

new home sales in october jumped to the highest 
level since february 1987 the government said friday suprising 
analysts who have been expecting rising interest rates this year to 
dampen sales 
in a joint release the departments of commerce and of housing 
and urban development said sales increased to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 733000 units the highest level in 20 months 
adding to the robust picture the government sharply revised its 
september figure to a 14 percent drop up from the previously 
estimated minus 78 percent 
last year most economists were expecting 1988 sales to be lower 
as interest rates rose however sales in the first 10 months of the 
year are a slight 02 percent higher than the same period last year 
fixedrate mortgages did rise from march through midaugust but 
eased until early november before starting to climb again 
adjustablerate mortgages however have risen steadily since the 
spring and now are nearly as high as before the october 1987 stock 
market crash 
this week the average rate excluding addon fees known as 
points was 1044 percent for fixedrate loans and 826 percent for 
the most popular type of oneyear adjustable rate mortgages those 
with caps on how high the interest can go according to the federal 
home loan mortgage corp both were slightly higher than a week 
earlier 
i think this is probably about as good as it gets michael 
carliner an economist with the national association of home 
builders said of the sales rate we have seen interest rates 
rising over the past few weeks and the rate of economic growth is 
likely to slow somewhat 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers association 
of america attributed this years unexpected strength in the 
housing market to the willingness of home purchasers to use either 
fixed or adjustablerate mortgages depending on which was the 
better deal 
consumers have switched back and forth such that the 
weighted average for mortgage rates has held steady at about 95 
percent since the beginning of 1987 he said 
by region sales rose 146 percent in the northeast to an annual 
rate of 110000 units 81 percent in the midwest to a 107000 unit 
rate and 51 percent in the west to 266000 in the south sales 
fell 39 percent to an annual rate of 249000 
the rate in the west boosted by strong population growth in 
california has not been higher since march 1979 when 279000 homes 
were sold 
for the year sales in the west are running about 12 percent 
higher theyre holding steady in the midwest and south in the 
northeast theyre running about 9 percent lower which economists 
attribute to high prices 
the median price of new homes nationally fell 09 percent in 
october to 115900 meaning half sold for more and half for less 
that followed a 64 percent increase in september 
the average price which is pulled up by very expensive homes 
fell 21 percent to 140100 after an identical increase a month 
earlier 
the median was 88 percent higher than a year ago while the 
average was 114 percent more

orders to us factories for manufactured goods 
increased 16 percent in october driven by a surge in spending for 
military equipment the government said friday 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted 2262 billion following a 
19 percent decline in september 
defense spending shot up 425 percent to 106 billion on the 
strength of orders for ships and tanks after falling 70 percent in 
september 
the military sector just went through the roof with the opening 
of the new fiscal year said david wyss an economist with data 
resources inc a forecasting firm in lexington mass the 
generals had money in their checking accounts again so they were 
busy writing checks 
however wyss said even excluding defense orders manufacturing 
remains strong he pointed to the backlog of unfilled orders which 
jumped 08 percent in october 03 percent in september and 12 
percent in august 
were still getting more orders in than were shipping goods 
out he said 
new orders for the first 10 months of this year are up 93 
percent from a year ago compared with a 66 percent increase 
between the same periods in 1987 and 1986 
however the key category of nondefense capital goods 
considered a good barometer of industry investment plans fell 30 
percent to 338 billion following a large 102 percent drop in 
september 
earlier in the year this sector provided much of the momentum 
for economic growth as industries geared up to meet an export boom 
fueled by the lower value of the dollar abroad 
it looks to me like the investment boom has gone past its peak 
and thats bad news we really need new investment and having it 
fall off is a problem said robert brusca an economist with nikko 
securities co international inc 
october orders followed a pattern set over the last several 
months in which the presence or absence of big transportation and 
military orders influenced overall performance 
transportation spending bolstered by motor vehicle manufacturing 
in addition to tank and shipbuilding jumped 85 percent in october 
to 343 billion after a decline of 89 percent in september 
excluding the transportation category orders rose 04 percent in 
october and fell 07 percent in september minus defense orders 
edged up 02 percent in october after dropping 17 percent in 
september 
orders for all durable goods big ticket items expected to 
last three or more years rose 23 percent in october to 1221 
billion after a 28 percent drop in september 
meanwhile orders for nondurable goods climbed 08 percent in 
october to 1042 billion after an identical drop of 08 a month 
earlier chemicals accounted for most of the increase although most 
industries were up 
wyss said the vigor in the nondurable industries which were 
having capacity problems early in the year could signal renewed 
price pressures 
shipments of manufactured goods were up by 05 percent in october 
to 2225 billion

deciding that free coffee was not much of a 
threat to the public the county health board has pulled the plug on 
a brewing controversy by waiving a rule that even the city council 
was violating 
few people knew it but under the law every business or 
organization that gave out coffee or soft drinks to the public was 
required to buy a 50 foodservice permit 
that meant all those doctors offices beauty shops autorepair 
businesses and even the city council which handed coffee out free 
were in violation 
this week the pueblo county health board voted to waive the 
required license businesses that otherwise are not in the food 
business are free to offer coffee soft drinks or wrapped pastries 
to their customers 
were trying to enforce the intent of the law not necessarily 
the letter of the law said health division chief roger stasiak 
the intent is to protect the publics health and coffee has not 
proven to be a significant problem 
its such a burden off my mind joked merle souder manager 
of a meineke discount muffler shop after the vote was take 
souder said he doesnt keep the coffee pot in a public area of 
his store but thats not to say some of our regular customers 
dont head straight for the coffee pot

thursday with bush and president reagan at the white house and 
they have assured us of their support of our objectives and for our 
strategy in montreal 
the montreal talks beginning monday will draw nearly 100 
nations for a midterm review of the fouryear uruguay round of 
trade negotiations 
yeutter spoke at the national press club just hours before 
leaving for montreal where trade ministers will conduct the most 
wideranging negotiations ever held to liberalize and regulate 
international commerce 
yeutter an agricultural economist who said he would be returning 
to work in the private sector once bush takes office in january 
adopted a tough negotiating stand in advance of the talks 
we are willing to leave montreal without any agreement in the 
15 categories on the agenda he said if agreement comes at the 
price of sacrificing basic principles we will not pay that price 
he said in prepared remarks 
at the top of the us agenda is obtaining a commitment from the 
participants for the eventual elimination of domestic and export 
agricultural subsidies said yeutter 
the main opposition comes from the 12nation european community 
which faces powerful lobbies opposed to reducing farming price 
supports ec officials have warned in recent days that if the united 
states continues to insist on its position the uruguay round could 
fail 
we hope that reason will prevail among the europeans yeutter 
said because agricultural reform makes too much economic sense to 
be abandoned its inevitable he predicted 
one argument the united states intends to make is that the 
elimination of subsidies would create jobs in the european markets 
which suffer high unemployment would result in lower food costs and 
would save billions of dollars in government funding for farmers he 
said 
a recent study by the center for international economics in the 
australian capital of canberra says agricultural liberalization 
would result in 3 million new jobs for europeans yeutter said 
the united states contends that doing away with government 
supports would save some 20 to 30 billion dollars annually in its 
own deficitridden budget and help farmers compete on an equal 
footing on world markets but agreement on such a move must come 
from all the us trading partners yeutter said 
no one is going to unilaterally disarm in agriculture he 
said if theres going to be any disarmament in agriculture it has 
to be a joint effort 
if the uruguay round fails to achieve any progress on this by its 
end in 1990 yeutter said congress may as well enact a farm bill 
boosting support for farmers 
yeutter predicted that controversy would also arise in montreal 
over the us push to modernize the 40yearold gatt agreement by 
including in it the booming world trade in services such as banking 
and tourism and providing protection for patents and copyrights 
piracy in this field is costing american entrepreneurs billions 
of dollars annually in lost revenues 
a large bloc of countries in the developing world argues that 
fledgling service industries would be hurt by the proposed 
regulations and that copyright protection would greatly increase the 
costs of such imports as computer software and pharmaceuticals on 
which they depend heavily

the state department will allow nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega to visit the united nations on monday even 
though his visa application was filed too late for the normal 
processing period it was announced friday 
privately us officials said ortega plans to meet with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who will address the un general 
assembly next week and will meet with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush 
but sources close to the nicaraguan government insisting on 
anonymity said ortegas main purpose in visiting the united nations 
will be to discuss the effects on nicaragua of hurricane joan which 
devastated broad areas of the country in october 
the sources said ortega wants to appeal for additional 
international assistance before the effects of the disaster become a 
forgotten issue they were unaware of any plan by ortega to meet 
with gorbachev 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said visas 
were approved for ortega his wife rosario and his son rafael 
for travel on dec 5 they will be accompanied by ortegas physician 
and 14 security guards 
mrs oakley said their applications were expedited even though 
they were not received within the 15 working days the us embassy 
in managua requires for processing 
visa applications from 14 other nicaraguans who wished to 
accompany ortega as part of his official party in effect were 
turned down because they were submitted after the deadline for dec 
5 travel 
last september ortega canceled a planned trip to the united 
nations because us authorities had not issued sufficient visas for 
his delegation the state department said at the time most of the 
applications were submitted too late to allow adequate time for 
processing

the state department said friday it has 
rejected a request from a south korean legislative committee that 
top us diplomatic and military officials testify in person about 
their knowledge of any us role in a bloody 1980 uprising in that 
country 
instead the department will be willing to respond to written 
questions from the committee deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the national assembly committee had asked that thenus 
ambassador william gleysteen and the commander of us forces in 
korea john wickham testify about their knowledge of the incidents 
at kwangju when hundreds perhaps thousands of people were killed 
in clashes with the south korean military 
mrs oakley said the views of gleysteen and wickham both of whom 
have since ended their service in korea will be incorporated in the 
official responses to written questions 
allegations have been made that the united states acquiesced in 
the transfer of korean troops to kwangju for the purpose of 
violently suppressing the rebellion 
opposition leader kim daejung has said the united states did not 
do enough to prevent the killings 
mrs oakley said that after careful consideration the department 
determined it would be inappropriate for gleysteen and wickham 
to testify in person but written responses would be agreed to 
because the incident at kwangju is a matter of great concern in 
korea 
in ruling out personal appearances by the two officials mrs 
oakley said the department considered basic principles of 
international comity and the manner in which foreign relations are 
conducted 
we also considered principals of immunity of government 
officials from providing testimony before foreign legislative 
bodies she said 
she added that the department believes it can be fully responsive 
to the committees requirements through written answers

east germany has an extremely bad human rights 
record and the berlin wall continues to bar better trade and 
diplomatic ties with the united states according to the departing 
us ambassador 
ambassador francis j meehan called east germanys claim it is 
not responsible for nazi crimes a bit ridiculous 
he predicted the communist nation will be slow to establish 
diplomatic relations with israel despite recent wooing of jewish 
leaders 
meehan 64 spoke in an interview nov 22 on condition his name 
not be used until he left east berlin on dec 1 he had been posted 
there since 1985 
on prospects for diplomatic ties with israel he said 
i think they will be the slowest ship in the convoy to tel 
aviv although there is no question that east germany now wants 
to make an impact on the world jewish community 
east berlin and tel aviv have never had diplomatic relations 
a procession of jewish leaders have visited east germany recently 
and elaborate statesponsored ceremonies in november marked the 50th 
anniversary of the start of the nazi pogrom 
they know that they have lagged behind in this and that it is 
important to get the world recognition they want said meehan 
but he said the states recent official treatment of jewish 
issues contrasts starkly to its refusal to accept moral 
responsibility for the holocaust 
east germany contends it is innocent of nazi crimes because it 
was founded in 1949 and because communists also were persecuted 
this position is a bit ridiculous meehan said it amounts 
to saying the place was neutral territory during the war 
meehan also noted that overtures to jews are clouded by the 
governments crackdown on the lutheran church because it has pushed 
for dialogue inspired by soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
policy of greater openness 
this is where the tolerance ends meehan said the party 
leadership is pursuing a needlessly severe attitude 
church publications have been censored or seized and human rights 
activists allied with the church have been detained 
in all east germany has an extremely bad record in human 
rights he said this record and its refusal to pay us claims 
for seized property are main stumbling blocks to better relations 
with washington he said 
east germanys desire for mostfavored nation trade status was 
out of the question 
it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to try and 
argue in the congress that there was a case for mfn for east germany 
so long as the wall is there and and so long as there are major 
limitations on freedom of emigration meehan said 
and there would be little growth in trade as long as us claims 
are unresolved 
east germany refuses to consider 80 million in claims filed by 
us companies and citizens for property lost after the nation was 
founded interest has boosted the sum to 300 million 
meehan expected little change in east german leaders resistance 
to sovietstyle reforms 
they dont quite know whats happening they dont know where 
its leading and theyre very unsure of the whole situation he 
said 
but because east germanys economy is strong compared with other 
warsaw pact countries it can afford to wait to gauge the outcome of 
gorbachevs reforms he said

president mikhail s gorbachev told chinas foreign 
minister friday he sees a basis for beginning the concluding 
stage of settling their dispute over cambodia and called for 
direct chinesevietnamese talks on the issue 
gorbachev also discussed a likely 1989 sovietchinese summit 
meeting in the session with foreign minister qian qichen it was the 
first visit of such a highranking chinese official to the soviet 
union in 31 years 
from the soviet viewpoint there was a basis for bringing the 
solution of the problem into the concluding stage gorbachev told 
qian according to the official soviet news agency tass 
as far as we know a similar constructive spirit marks the 
stance of the vietnamese comrades and the leadership of the peoples 
republic of kampuchea cambodia gorbachev said a dialogue 
between china and vietnam could play an important role 
gorbachev has made several overtures to china including an 
effort to settle the dispute over cambodia the most divisive issue 
that remains between the countries 
he urged they continue to improve their relations 
i think that our vital interests are not contradictory while 
cooperation has good chances both from the viewpoint of domestic 
requirements the tasks of modernization tackled by the two 
countries and from the international viewpoint gorbachev said 
we are satisfied on the whole with the development of 
cooperation in various spheres of life he said but we believe 
that this is only a beginning 
he called for more scientific cultural youth and tourist 
exchanges 
china wants the soviet union to use its influence to get all 
vietnamese soldiers out of cambodia where they have been fighting a 
chinesebacked resistance for the past decade and the dispute has 
been the main stumbling block to a sovietchinese summit 
sovietchinese relations soured in the early 1960s in a struggle 
over the direction of the world communist movement relations 
reached a low point in 1969 when they fought a brief frontier war 
but gorbachev has ordering a pullout of soviet troops from 
afghanistan reducing soviet troops on the chinese border and 
agreeing to direct talks about the vietnamese presence in cambodia 
without providing details tass said the discussion also touched 
on afghanistan 
tass said gorbachev and qian also discussed a likely 
chinesesoviet summit next year 
it was noted in the conversation that the leaders of the 
ussr and china were now considering having a summit meeting 
both sides attach great importance to it tass said 
the summit is likely to occur in the first half of 1989 with 
gorbachev traveling to beijing because senior chinese leader deng 
xioping is 84 and rarely travels abroad

the hijacking of a jetliner by five armed 
soviets who surrendered here friday comes at a time of increasing 
contacts between moscow and israel 
the cooperation between israeli and soviet officials and the fact 
the hijacking ended without bloodshed could accelerate the process 
of reconciliation 
some analysts were encouraged by the fact that soviet authorities 
asked israel to let the aeroflot jet land maintained diplomatic 
contacts throughout the day and sent the head of their mission in 
israel to observe events at bengurion airport near tel aviv 
this can only be seen as an improvement in relations and an 
important step forward for israels standing with the soviets 
said ted friedgut a professor of soviet politics at hebrew 
university 
in the past the soviets would never have considered giving the 
plane authority to come to israel perhaps they wanted to signal 
that theyre ready to trust israel with something serious it 
could be a step toward normal relations friedgut said in an 
interview 
a foreign ministry official also welcomed the cooperation but was 
more restrained in his optimism 
of course everybody will be very happy if this ends in good 
cooperation between the two countries the official said on 
condition of anonymity 
i wouldnt say it should be regarded as a breakthrough but 
yes you may say it shows the soviets at least have the minimum 
confidence that things will be handled properly here he said 
the foreign ministry indicated israel would react positively to a 
soviet request for extradition 
the moment we get a request we will examine it i dont see 
any reason why we would want to hold them said spokesman alon 
liel 
the soviets broke diplomatic ties with israel after the 1967 
middle east war when the jewish state seized the west bank gaza 
strip east jerusalem and golan heights from moscows arab allies 
a gradual thaw in relations began in july 1987 when the soviet 
union sent a quasipermanent consular delegation to tel aviv israel 
responded by sending a delegation to moscow in april 
this year the soviet union met a key israeli demand by permitting 
a growing number of jews to leave the country the years exodus of 
16572 jews through november is more than double last years outflow 
of 8011 the 1988 emigration figure is expected to be the highest 
in eight years 
the warming of ties also has extended to the sovietallied 
eastern bloc all of whose members severed ties with israel in 1967 
except romania 
in september hungary announced it was renewing full diplomatic 
ties after a 21year break the announcement followed visits to 
budapest by prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister 
shimon peres 
cultural ties have also been improving moments after the 
hijackers surrendered yevgeny yevtushenko a 55yearold soviet 
poet landed in israel for a series of poetry readings in jerusalem 
tel aviv and other israeli towns 
it is such an unhappy incident but i am landing here 
completely voluntarily yevtushenko joked on israel televison

with 463000 new payroll jobs indicating a 
continuing booming economy the percentage of americans at work 
reached an alltime high in november despite a slight increase in 
the unemployment rate the government said friday 
the job growth was twice what economists had anticipated and 
nearly double the 238000 increase in new jobs in october but a 
560000 person increase in the civilian labor force those holding 
or seeking jobs raised the unemployment rate from a 14year low of 
53 percent in october to 54 percent last month the labor 
department said 
whenever we have strong employment growth we usually bring 
more people into the labor force labor statistics commissioner 
janet l norwood said 
she added that she expects the 560000 figure the biggest 
onemonth increase since june 1986 to be revised downward later 
when the government has more data 
the labor force has been growing at a monthly rate of less than 
200000 over the past year with 100000 fewer teenagers seeking 
jobs in 1988 than in 1987 
that trend is expected to continue until 1994 when the offspring 
of the postworld war ii baby boom generation begin reaching 
employment age in greater numbers norwood told the joint economic 
committee of congress 
despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate the 
government figures showed 116 million americans holding jobs last 
month or 626 percent of the adult population age 16 or over both 
are record highs 
the november job gains were widespread including virtually every 
industry except for oil and gas drilling and department stores 
its quite clear that department stores are building up for the 
christmas holiday at a much slower rate than previously norwood 
said 
of the 463000 new payroll jobs in november factory jobs rose by 
71000 on top of a fouryear recordhigh 99000 new assembly line 
workers in october manufacturing employment is now 425000 above 
what it was a year ago 
nearly onefourth of the factory job gains have been in 
machinery indicating that the nations economic growth is being 
spurred as much by exports as increased consumer spending 
meanwhile factory workers continued to average four hours of 
overtime a week last month that suggests were going to have even 
more employment gains in the next few months said allen sinai 
chief economist for the boston co a financial consulting house 
construction employment increased by 55000 in november 
reflecting an upturn in housing starts after sluggish activity from 
july through october as well as unusually warm weather for the 
month 
in a separate report the commerce department said new home sales 
rose 35 percent in october to their highest level in more than a 
year 
factory orders also rose 16 percent in october the commerce 
department said in another report largely on military buying 
however orders for nondefense capital goods a key barometer of 
businessmens expectations of the economy declined for the second 
consecutive month 
before an election people tend to push off capital expenditures 
as long as there is some uncertainty and there has been some 
talk of a recession said charles renfro an analyst for 
alphametrics a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm come midwinter 
or early spring there might be some big increases 
the employment gains sent bond prices down among traders fearing 
an inflation from an overheating economy earlier this week the 
federal reserve released a survey by its 12 banks declaring that the 
economy was slowing 
however analysts both inside and out of the government said the 
november employment figures indicate another month of strong growth 
just like october 
this many jobs wouldnt be showing up unless the economy was 
very strong sinai said the feds strategy of small doses of 
interest rate hikes since last march to slow it down clearly has not 
worked the economy is moving ahead at a rate close to 4 percent 
while its noninflationary potential is only 24 percent 
renfro disagreed with the perception that continuing large job 
gains every month is a sign that the economy is overheating 
that would be true if consumers were trying to purchase more 
goods than are being produced he said but it looks like the 
growth is coming from exports and thats good news 
the fear among analysts since early 1987 when unemployment rates 
began falling into the range of 6 percent was that tighter job 
markets would begin pushing wages up faster than prices setting off 
a wageprice spiral 
but there was no evidence of that last month with the average 
wage among production workers unchanged from the 945 in october 
and only 33 percent above what it was a year ago consumer prices 
meanwhile have climbed at an annual rate of 46 percent so far this 
year 
one months figures cant be taken too seriously said sinai 
if you look over the past three months it shows earnings rising 
at 45 percent annually 
the reagan administration in its final economic forecast last 
month predicted that inflation will slow to 37 percent next year 
with a decrease in unemployment to an average 52 percent on 
economic growth of 35 percent 
norwood said accomplishing all three simultaneously will be 
very very difficult but she did not rule out the possibility 
that it can happen 
the labor force is growing by half the rate it was in the 
1970s so its going to be somewhat easier to maintain lower 
unemployment levels she said and at the moment there is not 
much upward pressure on inflation from wages

a mail carrier making his rounds heard a 
scream and rescued a blind woman and her guide dog who had fallen 
into a 9footdeep hole 
i feel he was really my angel for christmas connie kelley 
said after her rescue thursday probably he will have an extra 
present under his christmas tree this year 
jack grothe 37 a fouryear employee with the us postal 
service said he was delivering mail when he heard ms kelley 
scream he found her and her guide dog dazzle trapped in a hole 
which was dug by workers repairing a water line 
i couldnt reach her grothe said i had to jump in i 
picked her up walked to the edge pushed her out and her dog then 
got out myself 
being a mailman im a little cautious with dogs and this dog 
was really wonderful grothe said 
ms kelley 29 said she was going shopping when she fell into 
the hole and through no fault of the guide dog 
my dog was hesitant at first and i made her go forward she 
said she saw the hole up ahead i didnt know was there 
as the dog tried to squeeze her between the hole and a ladder 
ms kelleys foot slipped and she fell in dragging dazzle with her 
she said she was trapped in there three to five minutes before 
grothe found her 
i think if i had been there any longer i wouldnt have had the 
strength to get out of there with help she said 
doug michaud chief inspector for utility connections for the 
city of minneapolis said employees of petes water and sewer had 
neglected to put guard rails around the hole and had left it 
unattended 
he said he had reprimanded the owner dennis skjod but lacked 
the power to issue a citation 
skjod said his workers told him they had left the site to get 
some parts and that they had put up a small barricade enough to 
warn away a sighted person 
its a lesson to be learned he said from now on when we 
do jobs well have sightless people in mind and i thank god nothing 
serious happened he said he called ms kelley and visited her 
home after hearing about the accident

michael dukakis visited washington friday for 
the first time since losing the presidential election sadly 
conceding i wish i was here in another capacity 
still he received warm welcomes from democratic party leaders on 
capitol hill during a morning full of meetings before going to the 
home of the man who defeated him presidentelect george bush for a 
private visit 
when its all over we dont throw bombs at each other we sit 
down with each other dukakis said before his session with bush 
afterward dukakis had few kind personal words for his bitter 
election rival but promised to cooperate with the new 
administration provided bush works to cut the federal deficit 
without turning his back on health care day care education and 
other issues that the democrat focused on during his campaign 
do i look bitter dukakis asked in response to a question 
after a 35minute meeting with bush i feel pretty good actually 
dukakis said the meeting did not include any talk about the tone 
of the campaign which dukakis criticized at the time thats over 
now and our job is to meet some very formidable problems he said 
but he managed to work in a swipe at reagan administration deficit 
spending and warned bush against continuing such policies 
asked if he now considered himself a friend of the 
presidentelect dukakis at first laughed and then said im 
anxious to cooperate and play a constructive role 
bush in brief comments to reporters said he looked forward to 
working with dukakis and other governors 
to you and kitty and that wonderful family god bless you and 
have a great christmas bush told the departing dukakis 
dukakis also had a brief encounter with vice presidentelect dan 
quayle who was at the bush residence when dukakis arrived 
we shook hands and greeted each other said dukakis who 
during the campaign scornfully referred to the indiana senator in 
nearly every speech 
the trip to the nations capital was far different from the last 
time dukakis came near the end of the campaign when he still had 
secret service protection and was accompanied by a phalanx of aides 
this time he took a commercial flight accompanied by only two 
aides and traveled around town in a crowded rental car he met with 
washingtonbased campaign workers before heading home to boston 
dukakis had lunch texas sen lloyd bentsen who was the 
democratic vice presidential nominee and met separately with 
congressional leaders including house speaker jim wright dtexas 
and new senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
some party leaders have been highly critical of dukakis and his 
presidential campaign but bentsen wright and mitchell said he 
still had a part to play in party leadership 
i think its a very major role bentsen said 
were very proud of mike dukakis wright said at an earlier 
meeting he fought a good fight 
dukakis dodged questions about whether he would consider running 
for president again saying he was too busy catching up on 
gubernatorial duties to think about his political future 
but wright said all of us look to him for leadership for 
ideas for guidance for cooperation governor dukakis is young 
his future is not behind him it is ahead of him i think he has a 
lot to give this country 
dukakis thanked the speaker for his praise but did not hide his 
disappointment in losing the election 
i think in time ill probably emerge stronger but id be less 
than candid if i didnt say i wish i was here in another capacity 
dukakis said 
mitchell after a separate meeting with his fellow new englander 
also praised dukakis as a national leader of our party 
dukakis promised to maintain a party presence but did not claim 
to be the democrats national leader 
we have a good strong party with lots of leaders he said 
i hope to make a contribution 
just a week before the election dukakis said he had no respect 
for bush because of the negative tone of the republican campaign 
but on friday he refused to be drawn into a new battle with his 
election rival 
im looking ahead i assume he is dukakis said the 
election is over 
dukakis also visited with massachusetts sens edward kennedy and 
john kerry kennedy offered a question for bush 
the first thing we want to know is whether he still considers 
massachusetts a part of the union and we hope to get a positive 
response the senator said jokingly 
dukakis has been dealing with a state financial crisis at home 
but plans to take a florida vacation after next week spokesman 
james dorsey said dukakis had no highprofile appearances planned 
until february when he is to return to washington for the winter 
meeting of the national governors association

a letter apparently signed by a kidnapped 
swiss red cross official and released friday implied he was abducted 
to be exchanged for a hijacker held in geneva 
a leading cleric meanwhile said the united states was 
preventing the release of the nine american hostages held in lebanon 
no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction of peter 
winkler the 32yearold swiss red cross delegate seized by three 
gunmen in the southern port of sidon nov 17 
i was not kidnapped as a red cross delegate but as a swiss 
citizen my government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it 
has to cooperate in order to save my life said the letter 
delivered to a western news agency 
the 56word letter in english did not include a picture of 
winkler which is the usual method of proving its authenticity nor 
did it provide any indication of the kidnappers identity 
lebanese police theorize winkler was seized to swap him for 
shiite moslem air pirate hussein hariri he has been held in 
switzerland for more than 16 months and is scheduled to go on trial

black leaders protested friday in a 
newly declared whitesonly park but the ultraconservative town 
council vowed to resist mounting pressure to abandon increased 
segregation 
we are going to carry out fearlessly the will of the white 
people conservative party official koos van der merwe said at an 
emotional news conference in boksburg we will never surrender 
never never never 
he said conservatives are establishing a fund to support 
councilors who become targets of economic sanctions aimed at forcing 
them to reverse their decision 
the conservatives who took control of boksburgs town council in 
nationwide local elections oct 26 called the conference to rebut 
claims by the governing national party that three conservative 
councilors planned to defect that would tip the balance of power on 
the 20member council and enable the national party faction to allow 
blacks back to public facilities in the industrial town east of 
johannesburg 
one by one the 12 conservative councilors stood up and pledged 
their support for their partys policy 
one of the resegegrated facilities is the towns 37acre park 
boksburg lake where 11 black leaders from neighboring townships 
staged a peaceful protest 
south africa belongs to all of us declared tom boya head of 
a national association of black local officials 
the protest was billed as a mass sitin but the officials said 
poor organization led to a low turnout dozens of reporters but no 
police were on hand 
be warned do not push the patience of the people too far 
boya said asking where is this beautiful town being led is it 
being pushed to the stone age where no black person was supposed to 
be in town after certain times 
boksburg was the first of several conservativecontrolled towns 
to announce resegregation of facilities opened to all races in 
recent years the party won control of about 100 towns in october 
in some councilors are considering curfews for blacks 
black residents are boycotting boksburgs whiteowned shops and 
sports federations and corporations have threatened to withdraw from 
towns where resegregation takes place 
the national party which enacted south africas apartheid laws 
during 40 years in power has denounced the conservatives moves 
but has been widely accused of hypocrisy 
what we are doing is done by the national party is every second 
town van der merwe said they should either stop criticizing us 
or open all the water fountains swimming pools libraries and 
beaches 
early friday a bomb exploded outside a tax office in boksburg 
police said no one was injured in the blast caused by a small 
limpet mine there was no indication whether it was connected to the

mayor eberhard diepgen extolled the discovery of 
nuclear fission friday but said he cannot celebrate consequences 
from hiroshima to chernobyl as west germans marked the 50th 
anniversary of the breakthrough mixed with praise for the 
scientific leap were words of caution about end results of the 
revelation in a berlin laboratory by german scientists otto hahn and 
fritz strassmann in december 1938 
we cannot simply pay respect to the enormous and unexpected 
satisfaction of the human thirst for knowledge without at the same 
time also calling to mind the consequences from hiroshima to 
chernobyl the mayor told 1100 guests at west berlins congress 
hall 
other speakers also pointed to the bitter lessons of the us 
bombing of the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in august 
1945 and the april 1986 nuclear accident at chernobyl in the soviet 
union 
this discovery changed the world like hardly any other one 
before it technically and spiritually as well as economically and 
above all politically diepgen said 
today we recall this great scientific deed without being able 
to celebrate said the mayor a member of chancellor helmut kohls 
conservative christian democratic party 
resistance to nuclear power remains strong among younger west 
germans especially since chernobyl the disaster in the soviet 
ukraine dumped radioactivity over large parts of west germany 
causing widespread restrictions on sales of fresh meat and produce 
west germans located at the front line of the eastwest 
struggle also remain wary of nuclear weapons despite the current 
removal of mediumrange us rockets from their soil 
on dec 16 1938 hahn and strassmann started their fateful 
experiment in a laboratory in berlins dahlem section it showed 
that bombarding the uranium atom with neutrons leads to its 
splitting 
at first the pair were unsure of the implications then from her 
exile in sweden their jewish colleague lise meitner theorized that 
such a splitting could lead to the release of huge amounts of energy 
through chain reactions 
hahn won the 1944 nobel prize in chemistry for the work conducted 
at the kaiser wilhelm institute for chemistry 
albert speer the nazi arms minister later implied hahn was 
among german scientists trying to develop the atomic bomb bu many 
people say hahn dissociated himself from such efforts 
during fridays ceremony researcher professor peter brix said 
the hahn and strassmann discovery besides leading to nuclear power 
also brought about advancements in nuclear medicine and even 
astrophysics 
on the other side of the coin were victims of hiroshima and 
nagasaki nuclear weapons stockpiles and distrust of nuclear power 
since chernobyl he said 
many people now have a basic mistrust of science added brix 
who is from west germanys prestigious maxplanck institute 
it organized the formal ceremony with four other scientific 
research organizations

space shuttle atlantis lifted off 
into a windy sky at the last possible minute friday a 
spectacularly public act to carry into orbit a 500 million secret 
satellite that can pierce darkness or clouds to vastly enhance 
americas capacity to spy on the soviets 
not a word was heard outside the nasa and air force control rooms 
from commander robert gibson or the four other military crewmen who 
are carrying out the highly classified mission to deploy the 18ton 
satellite lacrosse 
air force secretary edward c aldridge who observed the liftoff 
from the control center thanked the launch team saying let me 
tell you that you have made a great contribution to the nations 
national security 
nasa waited out the same kind of fierce highaltitude winds that 
caused the postponement of the flight thursday found a momentary 
calm and set atlantis flying almost straight up on a northward path 
from the kennedy space center liftoff time was exactly 93034 est 
less than 90 seconds before the end of the threehour launch 
opportunity period 
very clean by the numbers is how mission commentator brian 
welch at mission control in houston characterized the start of the 
flight the vehicle is in very clean shape there are no systems 
problems whatsoever to report 
the public communications system a 24hour operation on most 
shuttle flights fell silent thereafter acting on air force orders 
nasa planned to break that silence only to say that the astronauts 
had an ok to proceed with their missions task and to give 24hour 
notice for atlantis return the flight is expected to last three or 
four days with landing at edwards air force base in california 
the first announcement came four hours into flight when mission 
control reported the crew of atlantis is go for orbit 
operations that meant the ships cargo bay doors were open and 
the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could begin 
all crew members are doing well and all systems of the orbiter 
are performing satisfactorily mission control said 
navy cmdr gibsons crew is air force lt col guy s gardner 
the pilot col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross of the 
air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
the outlines of their mission no longer are a secret not even 
to the soviets but details remain classified filling atlantis 
cargo hold is one of the most expensive satellites ever built it is 
not deterred by clouds or darkness from gathering radar images on 
the ground below 
atlantis liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third 
allmilitary mission was witnessed by a smallerthanusual crowd of 
a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides 
it was the third time atlantis had been launched into orbit 
the shuttle was in view of the launch site well past the 
twominute point when its spent booster rockets fell off the 
failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of 
challenger and loss of its sevenperson crew on jan 28 1986 
according to sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified mullane will use the shuttles crane to drop the 
satellite one of a series named lacrosse overboard the 
satellites orbit will take it over the soviet union and eastern 
europe and the information it gleans should help us intelligence 
officials verify soviet arms control compliance as well as serving 
as a radar eye for the new b2 stealth bomber 
defense officials contended the secrecy made it more difficult 
for soviet satellites and spy ships off the florida coast to monitor 
the flight and learn its purpose 
according to the official news agency tass the soviets already 
know much about lacrosse its antenna sources said spreads out 150 
feet and it has a 100foot long radar screen 
during deployment of the satellite believed set for saturday 
mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm to lift the 
satellite out of the cargo bay shepherd and ross reportedly will be 
suited up in the spacecraft airlock prepared to make a spacewalk if 
there is a problem with the satellite release 
after the lacrosse is set free gibson and gardner are to back 
off several hundred feet and fly formation with the payload until 
ground controllers are certain it is working properly if it is not 
an effort may be made to retrieve it for return to earth 
the sources also report the five crew members will conduct 
several experiments aimed at defining mans role as a military 
observer in space with reconnaissance a high priority 
it is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device 
that resembles handheld binoculars 
the tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises 
that could include troop maneuvers naval movements or ballistic 
missile launches 
the countdown was halted several times during the morning to wait 
out highaltitude winds up to 126 mph starting before dawn a pilot 
flew continuously through the launch path and balloons were sent 
aloft to take readings 
thursdays launch had been scrubbed by strong winds eight miles 
high and clouds made conditions marginal at best friday by 
contrast the sky was brilliantly blue and there was bright sunshine 
above fleecy clouds the troublesome winds were five miles up 
toward the end of the 632to932 am window of 
opportunity launch control got balloon data that showed 
acceptable winds the count continued only to be halted again at the 
31second mark because of concern about weather at a site in spain 
where the shuttle would have landed in case of emergency 
you gave us some heart failure there toward the end but we got 
it off nasa administrator james c fletcher told the launch team 
my thanks for another great job

former defense secretary caspar w weinberger 
on friday sharply attacked 7 billion in european loans to moscow as 
a potential aid to the soviet military 
these may be all going into production of better fertilizer 
he said in a speech to business executives the same chemicals 
however are used for chemical warfare in many cases the problem is 
we dont know i dont think we are at the stage where we can trust 
unquestioningly their pretensions 
the loans are not linked to particular transactions and have been 
made in the past two months he said he added that the bulk of them 
are guaranteed by west european governments 
in other remarks prepared in advance he called for immediate 
highlevel consultations by the united states and its allies on 
issues of economic and financial security 
i think nato with full ec european economic community and 
japanese endorsement should incorporate these new issues into 
plans to bolster alliance defense burdensharing and ensure that the 
west does not continue the gratuitous undisciplined financing of 
many soviet activities around the world inimical to vital western 
security interests he wrote 
he defined burdensharing as they americas allies pay more 
and we pay less 
a member of the audience commented that us grain sales also 
help the soviet union by freeing up its resources 
were guilty too weinberger replied 
im not criticizing europeans im criticizing the rush to do 
this on a rather broad basis and without any attempt to verify what 
the proceeds are going to be used for 
in his prepared remarks he pointed to soviet sales of bonds in 
the west and the possibility that in time millions of westerners 
could wittingly or unwittingly hold such bonds in their own 
portfolios or through pension funds 
and inevitably soon thereafter they would be told that that 
was another reason to grant favors and help that nice mr 
gorbachev weinberger said 
he noted reports that billions of western dollars are on deposit 
in banks owned by the soviet bloc 
weinberger criticized what he called the growing romance between 
the 12 governments of the community and the communist bloc he said 
businesses owned partly by west europeans and partly by the soviet 
union are a rapid way of putting western knowhow into soviet hands 
weinberger who stepped down as defense secretary in 1987 was 
speaking at a business managers conference on plans by the european 
community governments to dismantle barriers to trade among them by 
the year 1992 
he said greater european unity could help western defense for 
example by promoting standard weapons that could be used by all nato 
members

oliver l norths remaining challenges to 
irancontra charges were rejected by a judge friday but the major 
counts against him could still be scuttled by white house refusal to 
release classified documents 
us district judge gerhard a gesell rejected defense motions to 
dismiss charges that the former national security council staff 
member obstructed congressional investigations of reports he gave 
covert military assistance to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the decisions were released as gesell took the bench for a third 
straight day of closed hearings on norths objections to censoring 
395 government documents that independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
wants to use as evidence against him the secret hearings were 
scheduled to resume tuesday 
gesells rulings disposed of the last of norths pretrial 
motions his decisions have upheld 14 of the 16 charges originally 
brought against north by walsh 
but the reagan administrations decision not to allow north to 
use any of the 40000 pages of secret documents sought as defense 
evidence poses a serious obstacle to going forward with the major 
charges against the former presidential aide 
about 90 percent of the classified material pertains to the broad 
conspiracy charge that north and his three codefendants illegally 
diverted more than 14 million in profits from us arms sales to 
iran to the contras 
the rest of the material involves 12 other counts particularly 
charges that north lied to congress and destroyed nsc documents to 
obstruct an inquiry of the irancontra affair 
gesell has said repeatedly that north should be given wide 
latitude to introduce secret documents relevant to defending the 
conspiracy charge and a related count of theft of government 
property 
the judge has threatened to dismiss those charges if secret 
documents he determines are necessary to norths defense are not 
made available by the government for use at a public trial 
on thursday president reagan ruled out pardoning north but said 
duty requires him to withhold secret documents from the trial 
reagan denied the decision was a backdoor maneuver to let north 
off the hook on the major charges the things were blocking are 
the things that duty requires we block he said 
walsh contends that north does not need to disclose any secrets 
to get a fair trial of the charges he has asked gesell to bar any 
release by lawyers for the retired marine lieutenant colonel 
gesell gave north until dec 19 to specify any other secrets he 
considers important for his defense including information that 
might be elicited when high government officials are questioned on 
the witness stand 
the secrets that the administration wont release include the 
existence of covert intelligence operations and the location of 
american hostages in the middle east 
disclosure of such information could expose people in very 
difficult situations to torture and death walsh said in court 
last spring at the outset of the case 
but the information also includes the wellpublicized names of 
central american countries that helped assist the contras as well as 
nations such as saudi arabia and south korea that were asked to 
donate money to the rebel cause 
the countries were referred to by letter or number during 
congressional hearings on the irancontra affair but their names 
became widely known 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the names of 
countries were one of the minor categories indicating the 
administration might be more flexible about revealing their identity 
gesell has repeatedly expressed impatience with the idea of 
showing jurors documents stripped of references to information that 
has already leaked into the public domain 
in advance of this weeks hearings gesell directed walsh to 
devise an alternative to referring to the foreign countries by 
letter saying this masking technique appears unduly cumbersome 
the defense contends that referring to countries by numbers or 
letters would create confusion and make it impossible to question 
witnesses 
defense lawyers also want to disclose secrets to support norths 
contention that he destroyed documents to prevent disclosure of 
covert operations by members of congress or other government 
officials 
north and his codefendants former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakin and richard secord 
are to be tried separately

gorbachev and his wife raisa who will be in new york to meet 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush are expected to 
spend about a halfhour thursday inside the marblelined shopping 
atrium on fifth avenue said trump spokesman dan klores 
due to security reasons they may only get to browse through 
stores on the first of the malls six levels 
but with stores like cartier jewelers charles jourdan shoes and 
a bonwit teller department store gorbachev should come away with a 
representative feeling of what upscale means 
a large entourage of soviet and us security personnel and 
reporters will join the tour 
trump who lives on the top three floors of the 68floor trump

a historic agreement announced friday gives 
ohio power to regulate the energy departments cleanup of a uranium 
processing plant that has pumped 300000 pounds of radioactive waste 
into the environment 
ohio attorney general anthony celebrezze jr and sen john glenn 
dohio said the decree negotiated by federal and state attorneys 
gives the state a courtenforceable order to pressure the department 
to clean up the plant at an estimated cost of 1 billion 
the accord covers the feed materials production center in 
fernald which state officials blame for contamination of air and 
water at the 1050acre site 18 miles north of cincinnati the plant 
enriches uranium for nuclear power plants and for the governments 
nuclear research efforts 
jim alexander spokesman for the energy departments oak ridge 
tenn operations which include fernald said the agreement is 
evidence of intent to clean up the plant he said it is not intended 
as an admission of wrongdoing 
joe la grone the doe manager at oak ridge said this week the 
government will have spent 355 million by the end of fiscal 1989 on 
cleanup and safety at fernald 
the plant sits above the great miami river aquifer a water 
source for 2 million people the energy department has admitted that 
the plant emitted radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere over 
three decades 
glenn said he hopes the court decree will prompt congress to give 
high priority to cleanup of 17 energy department plants nationwide 
stanley chesley a lawyer for neighbors who have a 300 million 
classaction lawsuit pending against the plant said the settlement 
does not compensate victims give ohio authority over radioactive 
wastes stored at the plant or indicate whether the doe has committed 
the whole 1 billion 
chesley said he also is concerned that in exchange for the 
agreement the state agreed not to bring additional civil or 
criminal lawsuits against the department and past or present plant 
contractors and officials 
he said his group will proceed with its lawsuit at a dec 16 
hearing here 
marvin clawson a neighbor represented in the lawsuit said the 
agreement falls short of what the energy department should do 
it mainly addressed the hazardouswaste problem not the 
radioactive waste problem said clawson who lives four miles from 
the plant theyve hardly admitted to anything yet 
the 37yearold plant processes and molds uranium metal ingots 
for use elsewhere in the energy departments production of nuclear 
weapons there has been no production at the site since union 
workers went on strike oct 7 
energy department officials have said they expect production to 
resume when the strike ends 
us district judge s arthur spiegel signed the agreement and 
also is presiding over the neighbors lawsuit 
the agreement resulted from two years of negotiations prompted by 
two lawsuits filed by the state in 1986 and 1987 against the 
energy department the decree requires the department to pay the 
state about 1 million for penalties and to reimburse ohio for 
overseeing the cleanup celebrezze said 
he said the agreement requires fernalds current operator 
westinghouse materials co of ohio to pay 60000 in penalties for 
two releases of radioactive radon gas from concrete silos containing 
radium wastes it also requires national lead of ohio inc which 
operated the plant until the end of 1985 to pay 275000 for past 
environmental problems 
the decree also extends ohios jurisdiction over fernald to all 
state and federal hazardouswaste law and regulations celebrezze 
said 
this doesnt take away the federal preeminence in things 
nuclear glenn said but it does set a first in what any state 
attorney general in the united states has been able to work out 
the energy department is assessing the future of fernald and 
other plants nationwide in a secret study to be completed this month 
westinghouse materials co announced thursday it will lay off 350 
of the plants 1500 employees soon because of declining demand for 
processed uranium glenn opposes closing the plant because he thinks 
the cleanup would get a higher priority if it remains active 
glenn said fernalds problems date through 35 years of 
administrations and predecessors to the energy department including 
the atomic energy commission and the energy research and development 
administration 
ohio officials on nov 22 announced agreement with the doe on a 
50 million cleanup of hazardous waste at a uranium enrichment plant 
near piketon ohio in that settlement the department also agreed 
to be subject to ohio environmental regulation celebrezze said the 
details of the piketon agreement remain to be incorporated into a 
federal court consent decree the matter of fines to be paid for 
pollution vilaations at piketon also is not yet resolved

ms nussbaum 46 is the key prosecution witness against 
steinberg the disbarred lawyer is accused of beating lisa on nov 
1 1987 six years after she was brought as a newborn to live in 
their greenwich village apartment she was taken to a hospital the 
next day and later died of a brain injury 
steinberg has denied hitting lisa 
on her second day of testimony ms nussbaum said she once viewed 
steinberg as a godlike figure and tried to protect him when he 
severely beat and brainwashed her 
ms nussbaum testified that she was cut off for years from her 
family and friends during one period steinberg forbade her from 
leaving their apartment without permission she lost her job as an 
editor at random house after repeatedly missing work because of 
black eyes she testified 
that was the whole deal they kept it so secret ms 
nussbaums sister judy liebman 48 said outside the courtroom 
explaining that their family had not known the extent of her 
sisters problems 
ms nussbaums testimony buttressed the prosecutions claim that 
she was intimidated injured and virtually brainwashed by steinberg 
47 
i was extremely attached to him i thought he was the most 
wonderful person id ever met and basically i worshiped him 
literally i thought he had supernatural powers and healing 
and a lot of godlike powers she testified 
she said she has come to realize through therapy that none of 
that is true she has spent the past year in physical and 
psychological therapy including several operations 
while she had consulted psychiatrists and psychologists ms 
nussbaum testified that joel basically was acting as my therapist 
i was very shy and i guess tense and he was trying to make me 
more spontaneous more natural freer 
the death of little lisa in an affluent welleducated household 
shocked many new yorkers and led to a reexamination of the duty and 
ability of neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and 
report evidence of child abuse 
steinberg charged with seconddegree murder says she fell 
unconscious after choking on food and that he caused the bruises on 
her chest and back while trying to revive her 
charges against ms nussbaum were dropped 
police also found a 16monthold boy the couple raised in their 
apartment the boy was returned to his natural mother 
asked about her relationship with steinberg in late 1983 or early 
1984 ms nussbaum replied at that time he began beating me 
severely 
ms nussbaum said that on feb 18 1985 one of six times she 
tried to leave steinberg she fled to a womens shelter but was 
sent to bellevue hospital 
asked by doctors what had happened she concocted two stories to 
protect steinberg she had fallen down stairs or she was homeless 
and had been attacked by men on the street 
when doctors pointed out old injuries on her xrays she told 
them she had been a member of a sadomasochistic cult because i 
believed it 
he would encourage me to come up with stories fantasies about 
what happened since i had no actual memories of this myself i 
believed that i had some sort of an amnesia about it she said 
once she asked her father to come get her but steinberg walked 
in while she was packing and he got violent with me he threw me 
to the floor i hurt my leg 
when her father arrived she told him everything was fine because 
i was afraid of joels reaction

angola and south africa accused each 
other friday of delaying the signing of a longawaited interim peace 
agreement 
but both sides left open the possibility that a dispute over 
withdrawing 50000 cuban troops from angola will be resolved under 
us mediation or will be shelved for later discussions and that an 
interim agreement will be signed 
the tentative accord provides for the cuban troop withdrawal and 
for independence for southwest africa also known as namibia 
south african diplomat glenn babb told the british broadcasting 
corp that the signing was delayed because angola and cuba rejected 
a un proposal for monitoring the withdrawal of the cubans 
babb deputy director general of foreign affairs said however 
we can perhaps overcome the problem of not having a final 
verification document but that is still to be discussed here 
south african foreign minister roelof botha and defense minister 
magnus malan flew to brazzaville on friday to join the talks 
cuban delegates told reporters south africa insisted it be 
allowed to join the team monitoring cuban withdrawal cuba regards 
this as unnecessary saying the united states can monitor the 
withdrawal and report to pretoria 
chester crocker the us diplomat leading the negotiations has 
made no comment on the dispute crocker us assistant secretary of 
state for african affairs and architect of the peace plan has 
sought to induce south africa to grant independence to namibia by 
persuading the cubans to withdraw from marxist angola the 
territorys northern neighbor 
angolan rebels meanwhile vowed friday to continue their 13year 
insurgency if the peace talks fail to result in negotiations between 
the rebels and the angolan government and a genuine withdrawal of 
cuban troops 
the pledge by the national union for the total independence of 
angola came in a statement distributed in lisbon the capital of 
portugal 
the anticommunist guerrilla group has fought the government of 
president jose eduardo dos santos since losing a civil war after 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
the guerrilla movement is not party to the talks among angola 
cuba and south africa 
in a separate statement the rebels said they killed 53 soldiers 
in clashes wednesday in central benguela province they also claimed 
guerrillas penetrated a cuban military base near huambo 162 miles 
south of the capital luanda and destroyed fuel stored there 
the angolan newsagency angop said troops killed 34 guerrillas in 
fighting in uige moxico and huila provinces from nov 2329 and 
that the guerrillas group killed eight soldiers and 15 civilians 
during the same period it sdaid soldiers freed 52 people held by 
the rebels 
there was no independent confirmation of the reports

ernest ambler the longtime director of the 
national institute of standards and technology was chosen friday to 
be the first commerce undersecretary for technology 
ambler who plans to retire next year after 35 years of 
government service said he would serve in the new post only through 
march in order to give the bush administration a chance to name its 
own choice for the job 
the job of undersecretary for technology was created by congress 
this fall in a reorganization sought by commerce secretary c 
william verity 
in announcing amblers selection verity said he believed the 
federal government needed to do more to focus attention on the 
important role technological breakthroughs play in keeping america 
competitive in global markets 
todays global market realities demand not only the creation of 
new technologies atwhich america continues to excel but rapid and 
continuous transfer of these technologies to new products verity 
said 
verity said amblers first role would be to decide which commerce 
department agencies to include under the umbrella of a new 
technology administration 
since i took office 14 months ago one of the recurring 
comments i have heard from business leaders is that they dont know 
where to go or whom to talk to in government about technology 
advances or technology needs verity said legislative approval 
means we can for the first time bring together the remarkable 
scientific and technological resources of the commerce department

the key to an fbi sting operation that led 
to drug trafficking charges against more than 200 people was a savvy 
undercover agent who knew the customs of sicilian organized crime 
authorities said friday 
he was schooled in the rules of the sicilianitalian underworld 
who to talk to and how to show respect to the elders he was able 
to gain the confidence of the sicilian mafia said j ronnie webb 
a supervisory agent in the fbis buffalo office 
authorities announced thursday that they had smashed a major 
heroin and cocaine ring by charging more than 200 people in the 
united states and italy including sicilian mafia figures and 
associates of the gambino crime family in new york officials said 
friday that 60 people had been arrested in the united states and 24 
in italy and the others were still being sought 
codenamed busico for buffalosicilian connection the fbi 
operation got its start in 1983 during the arrest of andrea aiello 
of buffalo on charges of trying to import some 50 pounds of heroin 
at the time it was called the largest heroin seizure ever in the 
united states 
in the course of the aiello investigation the undercover agent 
learned of the desire by sicilian crime figures to ship heroin to 
the united states through buffalo 
despite the attention the aiello case drew the buffalo agent 
remained undercover and was able to cultivate underworld contacts 
for several years 
steven naum an fbi public affairs officer said the agent whose 
identity is being kept secret was skilled at passing himself as a 
drug dealer 
it was acting 101 for him sometimes naum said 
the investigation speeded up in 1985 with the socalled pizza 
connection arrests in new york city and other cities after that 
webb said the sicilians considered new york too hot 
buffalo was targeted by smugglers because it is close to canada 
and 400 miles away from new york city and its large number of 
narcotics agents authorities said 
in the spring of 1986 the fbi set up a phony international 
trading business dubbed bsc partake wholesale in a buffalo suburb 
the idea was to import heroin concealed in jars of tomatoes and 
olive oil 
although the operation never developed as a narcotics 
distribution point it did allow the undercover agent to broaden his 
contacts among drug dealers in the united states and italy 
the agent went to sicily where he was able to win the confidence 
of the sicilian family running the smuggling operation 
when he returned in 1987 bsc partake wholesale made dry run 
to test the route the sicilian organization sent the hamburg 
company 744 cases of tomatoes 
in july the cases of tomatoes arrived in buffalo undisturbed 
fbi agents and local us customs agents had notified customs in new 
york city and officials quickly sent the shipment through webb 
said 
at the same time undercover agents flew to chicago san 
francisco new york city and rockford ill using ties to the 
sicilian family they met international drug smugglers with global 
operations 
the investigation mushroomed from there webb said 
busico spun off a number of undercover operations in other 
cities including new york philadelphia miami and newark nj 
authorities were reluctant in give details of those operations 
because they were continuing 
in new york however us attorney rudolph guliani said a 
related investigation revealed that members of the gambino crime 
family were importing heroin in wine bottles from sicily and 
distributing it to buyers through pizza parlors 
the gambino organization swapped cocaine for the heroin cocaine 
has a higher street value in italy guliani said 
the deal is evidence of the increasing role of the mafia in 
cocaine trafficking he said previously cocaine trafficking was 
mainly the business of south american drug lords

allegedly played a role in the irancontra affair was not on any 
official business when he was killed in a plane crash in mexico 
the israeli embassy said friday 
amiram nir was killed wednesday while traveling under an assumed 
name nir 37 was a former conterterrorism adviser to israel who 
once briefed vice president george bush on secret arms sales to iran 
he was killed wednesday when a cessna t210 he had chartered 
crashed at a ranch near ciudad hidalgo in michoacan state 110 miles 
west of mexico city the pilot also was killed and three other 
passengers were injured 
embassy spokesman israel meyami said in a telephone interview 
he was not here in any official business and he did not contact 
the embassy i dont know how long he was in this country but it 
musnt have been very long 
meyami said he went to morelia the michoacan state capital on 
thursday to get the body and bring it to mexico city he said it 
would returned to israel 
isauro gutierrez fernandez a spokesman for the state attorney 
generals office said nir was traveling under the name pat weber 
gutierrez said by telephone thursday he did not know why nir was 
using as assumed name and meyami said he had no more details 
nir arrived in mexico city on sunday and traveled to uruapan 190 
miles west to stay with friends it appears he had some possible 
business involving shipments of products from latin america to 
europe gutierrez said 
dov schmorak the israeli ambassador said in an interview on 
israels army radio that nir apparently missed a regularly scheduled 
flight from uruapan to mexico city and hired a private plane 
he quoted mexican authorities as saying preliminary information 
suggested the crash was caused by a rain storm 
lawrence e walsh special prosecutor in the irancontra case 
had sought nir for questioning but israel insisted he be granted 
immunity from prosecution so nir never testified 
testimony given to us congressional investigators said nir was 
an important liaison in secret arms deals involving the sale of us 
weapons to iran 
former white house aide oliver north suggested it was nirs idea 
to divert funds from the arms sales to nicaraguan rebels israel has 
denied it 
shimon peres now israeli foreign minister appointed nir as his 
adviser on counterterrorism in 1985 when he was prime minister and 
assigned him to serve as liaison with north 
nir a former journalist met in washington with north and adm 
john poindexter president reagans national security adviser in 
january 1986 and proposed renewing arms shipments to iran at 
meetings with north in europe and israel he discussed shipping us 
arms through israel and diverting profits to the rebels known as 
contras 
a ban by the congress on military aid to the contras was in force 
at the time 
the israeli also accompanied north and robert mcfarlane the 
former national security adviser to iran in may 1986 to discuss the 
release of american hostages held by proiranian lebanese in return 
for hawk wantiaircraft hawk missiles 
on july 27 1986 he briefed bush on the program involving us 
weapons sales to iran bush said he does not remember much about the 
briefing although his aide craig fuller attended the meeting and 
took notes 
nir stayed on after yitzhak shamir succeeded peres as prime 
minister in october 1986 and the irancontra affair exploded that 
november he resigned this year

for 8 years come rain or snow sen william 
proxmire dwis and labor statistics commissioner janet l norwood 
have met the first friday of every month in the dirksen senate 
office building for an economic tea dance much as he tried to set 
the beat shed only waltz 
they had their last session friday with the 73yearold senator 
holding his final hearing of the joint economic committee of 
congress before retiring next month 
as usual proxmire asked leading questions attempting to get the 
chief keeper of the nations economic statistics to poohpooh the 
rosy spin the administration puts on the employment figures each 
month 
with equal aplomb mrs norwood a holdover appointee of former 
president jimmy carter reappointed twice by president reagan 
carefully phrased her answers to avoid any direct or implied 
criticism of economic policymaking by the presdent the congress or 
the federal reserve board 
addressing mrs norwood for the last time as a member of the 
committee in her 101st appearance before it proxmire said he 
expected her usual public truthful and unvarnished explanation 
of the november numbers 
however that did not prevent him from trying one last time to 
get her critize the administrations latest and last economic 
forecast of 35 percent growth 37 percent inflation and a 52 
percent unemployment rate for next year 
i want to see if you can evade this question he said 
referring in good humor to their past duels 
mrs norwood responded that with the labor force growing less 
slowly it will be easier for the nation to maintain lower 
unemployment rates than in the past and that there really isnt much 
evidence of any wage inflation 
but she acknowledged that it will be very very very difficult 
to achieve both a 5 percent unemployment rates and an inflation 
rate declining to 15 percent by 1994 as the administration 
forecasts 
proxmire began holding the hearings 17 years ago in response to 
an order by president nixon to the labor statistics commssioner at 
the time geoffrey moore to quit giving the press briefings on the 
numbers 
if the labor statistics commissioner could not hold a press 
conference to offer a truthful and unvarnished explanation of 
the numbers as proxmire said at the time then congress would 
compel it in the form of a hearing 
while the only people in attendance normally are limited to 
proxmire mrs norwood a few members of eachs staff and a handful 
of reporters no force including the weather has been able to 
get in their way since 
both usually hang around briefly upon the conclusion of the 
hearings to answer questions from reporters on the numbers 
a year ago when the rest of the government was shut down by a 
severe blizzard on an unemploymentreport friday proxmire jogged 
through the snow to make the hearings and mrs norwood spent the 
preceding night in a hotel near the capitol to make sure the weather 
would not interfere with her attenndance 
other economists in the bureau of labor statistic left their 
homes at 430 am some of them walking miles from the virginia 
suburbs to their offices to make sure that experts who compiled the 
report would be available to answer questions upon its release at 
830 am 
both proxmire and bls officials said friday they expect that 
tradition to continue 
this is very important to her said henry lowenstern an 
assistant labor statistics commissioner she really believes in 
the need for a public forum 
proxmire said he is sure that rep lee hamilton dind now the 
committees chairman will maintain the practice of the monthly 
hearings 
i think we have them pretty well established now he said

the soviet union appealed friday for an 
international conference aimed at demilitarizing afghanistan after a 
decade of civil war and said it hoped such a forum would lead to a 
coalition government 
the main thing is to involve an international mechanism in 
afghanistan for avoiding bloodshed in that country deputy foreign 
minister vladimir petrovsky said at a news briefing 
he said yuli vorontsov first deputy foreign minister and 
ambassador to afghanistan would fly to saudi arabia on saturday to 
meet with burhanuddin rabbani current chairman of the afghan 
guerrilla alliance 
saudi officials arranged the meeting with the afghanistans 
cooperation as a means of finding ways for an internal afghan 
settlement he said but added that it was not connected with an 
international conference 
insurgent leaders said serveral says ago they would meet with 
vorontsov in saudi arabia this weekend 
petrovsky also said an international forum would not be related 
to the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan under a 
unmediated agreement signed april 14 in geneva 
the soviets have suspended their withdrawal to protest continued 
fighting by the ussupported guerrillas who were not parties to 
the agreement and said when it was signed they would continue the 
war 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 
1979 an estimated 115000 soviet soldiers were in the country when 
the withdrawal began may 15 
half the red army troops were gone by aug 15 as stipulated in 
the agreement and the rest are to be out by feb 15 1989 
petrovsky said the soviet union is urging the united nations to 
organize a conference as soon as possible he set no conditions 
about the participants or location 
he said it was important that afghanistan be represented at the 
conference by a broadly based coalition government which the 
afghan government has been trying to form the guerrillas have 
rejected the offer 
we hope that this conference will help bring about a coalition 
government petrovsky added 
afghanistan central america and the middle east will be on the 
agenda when president mikhail s gorbachev meets with president 
reagan and presidentelect george bush next week petrovsky said 
gorbachev will be in new york to address the united nations 
petrovsky described the topic as the soviet leaderships views on 
major issues of world development 
the soviet leader also will confer with fidel castro the cuban 
president in havana and meet with prime minister margaret thatcher 
in london petrovsky said all the meetings on gorbachevs trip were 
related

her election has been called a final crisis for 
the church but a clergywoman is quietly accumulating the votes to 
become the first woman bishop in the worldwide anglican communion 
the rev barbara c harris elected sept 24 by the boston 
episcopal diocese to serve as suffragan assistant bishop already 
has support from more than twothirds of the 120 standing committees 
needed to confirm her election according to james solheim a 
spokesman for the boston diocese 
solheim said harris also is expected to win the necessary support 
from the episcopal bishops since the majority of them already 
support women priests 
but even her supporters acknowledge that harris consecration 
promises to create a rift between conservative and liberal branches 
that will test the unity of a church that has been known for its 
ability to overcome divisive issues 
objections to harris election range from her gender to a 
perception that she lacks sufficient training harris attended 
villanova university but has no degree she studied theology through 
correspondence courses and with tutors rather than attending a 
seminary 
the final crisis of the episcopal church is now upon us 
began a pastoral letter from seven bishops of the evangelical and 
catholic mission an episcopal group that opposes female priests and 
bishops 
the bishops said elevating harris to bishop would amount to 
rejecting the image of god as a male in favor of a religiosity 
tailored to human convenience 
the question bothering harris critics solheim said has more to 
do with the future unity of the church than with her own gender or 
political views since some bishops say they will never support the 
ordination of women 
such opposition in massachusetts is minimal said jeffrey penn a 
diocesan spokesman 
harris 58 is refusing to comment publicly on the storm 
surrounding her election until a majority of the standing committees 
and episcopal bishops give her their support making the election 
official 
some 1200 women have been ordained since the episcopal church in 
1976 decided to allow women priests that decision paved the way for 
female bishops since all bishops must first serve as priests 
the issue of women bishops is viewed more seriously because of 
their powers to ordain priests and confirm believers harris would 
become the first woman bishop in the historic apostolic succession 
a direct line of christian hierarchy dating back to jesus apostles 
harris became a priest in philadelphia in 1980 after a career in 
corporate public relations most recently she has headed the 
episcopal church publishing co that produces the witness a liberal 
church publication 
in a compromise measure in july the episcopal churchs governing 
convention in detroit approved a measure allowing any congregation 
rejecting a woman bishop to petition for a male episcopal 
visitor bishop to administer confirmations 
 
but the woman bishop still would make the periodic pastoral 
visits required by church law even to congregations rejecting women 
bishops

fourteen months ago they wed in a 
fairytale ceremony at an alpine castle on friday one of europes 
aristocratic young couples was buried the princess a victim of an 
apparent drug overdose her prince driven to suicide 
mourned by 150 noble relatives prince ludwig rudolf of hanover 
a 33yearold greatgrandson of germanys last emperor and his 
26yearold bride isabelle were laid to rest in a driving frozen 
rain in the village of gruenau 120 miles west of vienna 
among the mourners at a mass in the whitewashed village church 
were the princes aunt princess sophie of greece sister of queen 
elizabeth iis husband the duke of edinburgh and four members of 
austrias deposed house of hapsburg 
the ceremony made no mention of how they died with similar 
restraint none of the noble houses that sent about 40 wreaths to 
the funeral signed their family names at least two wreaths bore a 
royal crown 
the funeral came 14 months after a lavish fiveday wedding in the 
alpine castle of bleiburg in southern austria home of the bride 
countess isabelle von thurn 
five months later as the austrian tabloid kurier respectfully 
phrased it isabelle made a gift of a son otto to her husband 
on sunday night the princely pair again made news this time it 
was gruesome 
after dining with an obscure west german pop group and an 
unidentified american isabelle retired to her bedroom in the 
couples home the socalled queens villa in gmunden 150 miles 
west of the capital 
several hours later the prince found his wife dead on the bed 
from what police said was apparently a drug overdose probably 
cocaine the prince who was in shock drove from the house and 
shot himself in a nearby forest of the almtal valley his family 
said 
the couples grisly end has dented popular images of aristocrats 
embodying the vanished glory of the stillbeloved hapsburg monarchy 
forced to abdicate in 1918 at the end of world war i 
ever since the deaths became known monday newspapers in austria 
and west germany have painted a different picture of what kurier on 
friday sardonically labeled high society 
reporters trying to learn more about the dead couple got little 
out of aristocrats at fashionable vienna nightspots few admitted to 
knowing the pair and none discussed the use of what germans often 
call the noble drug cocaine which is blamed here for a record 
number of fatal overdoses this year 
such silence reportedly hampers police tracking wellborn drug 
offenders 
there are barriers we simply cant cross salzburg narcotics 
detective karl walder told kurier 
police insisted on anonymity this week when revealing that old 
needle marks were found on the arms of the royal couple and used 
syringes were confiscated from their home 
i dont want to burn my fingers said one police official 
a preliminary autopsy on the princess showed she died of heart 
and lung edema or swelling from an abnormal accumulation of fluid 
apparently caused by a cocaine overdose asked if more autopsy tests 
would be made public an official at a local state prosecutors 
office voiced relief no trial would be necessary 
death ends all punishment he noted demanding anonymity 
prince ludwig rudolf was no stranger to the courtroom in 1981 
according to press reports reluctantly confirmed by munich state 
prosecutors he testified at a drug trial that also involved rainer 
werner fassbinder the west german film director who died after a 
cocaine overdose in 1982 
asked why he transferred some 20000 to the account of a 
suspected cocaine dealer the prince reportedly told the munich 
court the money was to pay for a car 
last week state prosecutors in the west german city of hanover 
closed another drug trafficking investigation against the prince for 
lack of evidence 
word that the investigation was dropped apparently had not 
reached the prince when he shot himself hanover prosecutors 
spokesman klaus ramberger said 
newspapers have speculated this may have increased the panic the 
prince felt when he found his wife dead at 245 am monday 
ludwig rudolf quickly alerted the red cross telling them in a 
telephone call that his wife might have taken cocaine 
police later tested the other guests at the villa for drug abuse 
and pronounced them clean 
but the prince reportedly did not wait even for the emergency 
doctor to arrive to examine his wife before leaving the villa 
taking a hunting gun 
according to press reports based on police sources he did call 
his brother in london prince ernst august of hanover telling him 
of his suicide plans and asking him to take care of his baby son 
the line to london then went dead police alerted to look for 
ludwig rudolf failed to find him before a forest worker discovered 
his body slumped across the steering wheel of his car with a bullet 
wound to the head

jury about allegations that she tried to sell one of them for 
cocaine 
i didnt know what was going on said rhonda romero i walk 
outside and my kids are gone they told me id sold him for 2 ounces 
of cocaine this is ridiculous 
ms romero was testifying before the nueces county grand jury on 
thursday when police took the children 1 and 2 years old 
police did not have a court order to seize the boys but the 
texas family code says a court order is not necessary if there is 
immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child and 
there is no time to obtain a temporary restraining order said 
district attorney grant jones 
jones said the grand jury is investigating the sale or 
attempted sale of a child 
ms romero said she is unemployed and could not care for the 
children properly so she was trying to find them decent homes the 
older boy was staying with another couple but that she did not trade 
the child for drugs 
the grand jury was to continue hearing testimony in the case 
the children will be supervised by the texas department of human 
services until a court hearing within 10 days determines who should 
care for them

soviet and american delegates to an emerging 
leaders summit heard letters friday from mikhail gorbachev and 
presidentelect george bush who said world peace could be developed 
through better understanding 
you are the leaders of tomorrow bush said in a letter read 
during a plenary session that opened the weeklong conference 
the conference has 340 delegates most of them in their 20s and 
30s from the two nations 
gorbachev originally expected to attend the conference as part 
of his visit to the us next week to address the united nations 
sent a letter that echoed bushs 
your forum is a sign of real changes for the better in the 
world gorbachev said its your mission to advance history to 
write its new pages and chapters you are to carry the burden and 
beauty of insuring conclusively that it will be no longer be written 
by the sword and the yoke 
viktor mironenko 35 first secretary of the communist youth 
league a member of the supreme soviet presidium and head of the 
russian delegation took up the theme 
referring to philadelphias role in us history and the writing 
of the constitution mironenko said the challenges todays delegates 
face are even tougher because they are more complex 
each generation of humans takes one or more steps toward making 
the world free of wars and aggression we are striving ahead even 
though our world is far from perfect but we have to live in this 
world together he said 
alluding to gorbachevs current glasnost reforms mironenko 
said we have come to the conclusion that it is openness not 
closeness that makes society strong 
sixteen delegate commissions will cover major topics affecting 
the two world powers government and political affairs 
international business and trade youth work and social service 
domestic and international law military media religion labor and 
management education global environment international finance 
science and technology medicine and health care 
each commission has scheduled seven threehour sessions during 
the week 
we must understand each other better because it will help world 
peace said sen arlen specter rpa applauding gorbachevs 
efforts to democratize soviet government it is a very healthy 
sign 
as we view democracy in the changing soviet union we are more 
impressed by the dissents than the agreements 
there will be daily updates on each commissions discussions 
which are closed to the public and to reporters at the end of the 
summit next week delegates will compile the final appeal a 
document outlining strategies for improved relations between the 
superpowers 
philip hughes assistant secretary of commerce in the reagan 
adminstration told delegates there is world confusion on what 
gorbachev represents does he want to make the soviet union stronger 
in the world community or is he really seeking change 
then there is skepticism the alienation between the us and 
soviet union has existed for so long that many americans are 
skeptical whether any new leader can make any change permanent 
hughes said 
american rabbi gary zola 32 of cincinnati said he expected the 
religious sessions will touch on human rights freedom of religion 
and of course soviet jews 
that means bilateral relations humanitarian issues regional 
conflicts said sergei chelnokov 
chelnokov is head of the soviet committee of youth organizations 
which is cosponsoring the meeting with the american council of 
international leadership 
in addition to the formal meetings the delegates will have 
sightseeing lunches at various educational institutions and dinners 
at homes and on saturday the armynavy football game

george bush and michael dukakis formerly 
bitter rivals met cordially friday though dukakis resorted to 
campaign rhetoric in warning the chickens are coming home to 
roost from republican economic policies 
bush who defeated the democratic governor of massachusetts for 
the presidency on nov 8 said the postelection visit was in the 
finest tradition of american politics 
the presidentelect who instigated the meeting said i want 
to express my appreciation to governor dukakis for coming our way 
we had good discussion of the issues that are facing the country in 
a spirit of good will 
dukakis also called it a good discussion he offered no judgment 
on bushs early transition moves saying the real test will come 
when the new administration is fully formed and begins to move 
forward with its priorities 
the vice presidentelect dan quayle often the object of 
dukakis scorn during the campaign greeted him inside the vice 
presidents residence along with james baker iii bushs campaign 
manager and his choice for secretary of state both left before

after the visit the two stepped out without topcoats into the 
brisk afternoon for a brief word with reporters 
dukakis who earlier friday made a series of calls on the 
democratic leaders of congress said he and bush talked about the 
future i expressed my concern obviously about the deficit and 
some of the issues the democrats campaigned on better health care 
housing education and the environment 
he said he didnt bring up the negative tenor of the campaign 
we had a good tough campaign thats behind us dukakis said 
the question now is how do we build a good country 
the governor joked that he was hesitant to offer bush advice on 
the deficit given his own problems with his states budget but then 
he said in earnest that the country faces a very formidable 
challenge weve had eight years of endless borrowing and spending 
and the chickens are coming home to roost 
he said the vice president is anxious to learn and listen and 
reach out and thats a good thing 
bush left him with a seasonal wish god bless you and have a 
great christmas

robertson and spoke of the wonderful way that friendships 
survive campaign battles 
robertson who returned last week from south africa gave bush an 
upbeat report on racial progress in the whiteruled country and said 
bush told him he wished jesse jackson and other black american 
leaders would visit south africa and explore firsthand whats 
happening because there have been some significant changes over the 
last 10 years 
on another subject as bushs presidential transition efforts 
moved closer to the jan 20 inauguration the vice president 
expressed chagrin at reporters questions about why he made no 
additions to his cabinet this week 
theres no holdup were way ahead of schedule he said 
complaining about early premature needless speculation 
at the outset of the meeting with robertson bush said some 
people dont understand the campaign they think that when you run 
against someone in a campaign that that injures friendships 
citing earlier sessions with democratic leaders including 
jackson bush said thats not true its wonderful the way the 
american political system works 
robertson a longtime critic of sanctions against south africas 
government said he gave bush a private message from that nations 
foreign minister about the situation in angola in southern africa 
and the proposed withdrawal of cuban troops there 
the time has come to recognize the south african government 
needs a little encouragement said the conservative television 
evangelist he cited as positive steps the governments movement 
from prison to a halfway house of nelson mandela and the commutation 
of death sentences for the sharpeville six 
robertson said he had spoken with black mayors in soweto 
seventyfive percent of the black people in south africa are 
saying please we dont want sanctions and disinvestment because 
they are falling most severely on the poor blacks of south 
africa he said 
bush began his day meeting with bermuda premier john swan and 
ended it with a courtesy call from argentine president raul 
alfonsin who had reports of a mutiny by army troops back in buenos 
aires to worry about 
the presidentelect also was meeting a group of evangelical 
leaders 
bush was asked if he had a place in his cabinet for robertson 
just good friend the television evangelist interjected

liberal governor coming out of nowhere made clear immediately

six contra supporters accused of 
attacking nicaragua urged a judge friday to dismiss their case on 
the grounds the united states has been waging a de facto war against 
the sandinistas 
they asked us district judge norman c roettger to throw out an 
indictment accusing them of violating the us neutrality act by 
recruiting mercenaries and launching operations against the 
sandinista government in nicaragua from us soil in 1985 
this is a ludicrous thing said defendant mario calero 
brother of top contra leader adolfo calero there has not been a 
violation of the neutrality act the executive branch was funding 
and directing the war 
adolfo calero testified friday that the rebels continued to 
receive us aid such as private contributions funneled through 
thenwhite house aide oliver north even during the time that 
congress cut off military funds 
in testimony reminiscent of what he told the irancontra 
investigations he said north and other government officials never 
advised him to cease his activities because of the congressional 
action 
it was the opposite said the contra leader we were told 
not to give up to continue the struggle 
after the days testimony roettger continued the pretrial 
hearing until jan 5 and said he would rule on the dismissal motion 
shortly thereafter 
the neutrality act forbids private citizens from launching 
usbased military operations against any nation with which the 
nation is at peace 
the defendants won a quick procedural victory when roettger 
brushed aside the us attorneys efforts to delay arguments on the 
issue until trial 
just before the noon recess roettger agreed to take more 
testimony and warned prosecutors that he expected to look broadly 
at the war and peace issue 
at one point the judge also expressed impatience with the 
prosecutions contention that the only purpose of us aid to the 
nicaraguan contras was to interdict arms to leftist rebels in nearby 
el salvador 
referring to president reagan the judge said i remember a 
badge that said im a contra too it didnt say anything about 
interdicting arms 
the judge sharply questioned assistant us attorney eric 
dubelier on whether the government contends it was at peace with 
libya when us navy jets attacked tripoli in 1986 
dubelier conceded the us was not at peace with libya in that 
case but asked in return where do you draw the line 
if the defenses line of reasoning was accepted dubelier said 
then the neutrality act could not be used now against anyone 
preparing to invade the soviet union 
the group was indicted in june after charges of reagan 
administration footdragging opponents of aid to the contras 
accused former attorney general edwin meese iii of stalling the case 
because it threatened to uncover norths involvement 
the indictment accused the contra supporters of recruiting and 
training mercenaries to fight with contras supplying them with 
equipment leading them on expeditions including one aimed at 
blowing up a nicaraguan bridge and violating firearms laws 
the seven original defendants were thomas posey head of the 
alabamabased civilian materiel assistance group mario calero a 
former supply manager for the rebels joe adams adolfos former 
bodyguard jack terrell a former mercenary who turned against the 
effort and went to authorities maco stewart a wealthy former texas 
businessman and state official who now lives in france jose coutin 
a civilian materiel assistance liaison in florida and alex 
martinez a conservative cubanamerican stockbroker 
stewart allegedly financed some of the activities 
some of the defendants including terrell and posey have 
produced documents showing the fbi and other agencies were aware of 
their activities in aiding the contras and have said knowledge of 
their activities went all the way to the white house 
but adams decided to plead guilty and received a sentence of a 
50 fine and one day of probation the other six defendants continue 
to fight the charges 
terrell who faces a possible 33year jail sentence was accused 
of buying a manlicher 308caliber rifle to be used as a sniper 
weapon in nicaragua 
coutin faces 13 years if convicted because he allegedly gave his 
passport to a mercenary while the rest face up to eight years on 
two neutrality act violations 
a second neutrality act indictment returned by the same grand 
jury accuses six more men of running a training camp for the 
contras as well as supplying them with weapons that included a 20mm 
cannon that case is being heard by a different judge

the beatty united methodist church is 
returning 110 acres of land taken from the klamath indians in the 
1920s 
i feel really good about united methodist doing this said 
charles kimbol chairman of the tribe i think it was really a 
fine gesture on their part 
a ceremony will be held sunday at the church located in the tiny 
communty of beatty about 35 miles northeast of klamath falls 
the land was deeded to the church by president warren harding in 
the 1920s it was originally part of the klamath reservation which 
covered 11 million acres before the tribe was dissolved by federal 
decree in 1954 the klamaths were restored to tribal status in 1986 
the church will retain five acres on which the church stands 
the klamaths currently have about 200 acres of land mostly 
indian cemeteries scattered around the area kimbol said 
the tribe hasnt decided what to do with the land yet but is 
putting together plans for economic development kimbol said about 
60 percent of the 1200 tribal members in klamath county are 
unemployed he added 
housing or a community center for about 25 tribal members living 
in beatty are possibilities kimbol said 
the idea of returning the land came from the revs kevin and 
carol seckel who ministered at four united methodist churches in 
rural klamath county a few years ago said patricia davidson a 
former lay minister at the beatty church and a member of the klamath 
tribe 
the indians didnt realize it was there she said 
the idea was approved by church leaders and the churchs annual 
conference she added 
as older members have died or moved away the congregation of the 
beatty church has dwindled to the point where as few as three 
people sometimes attend services davidson said 
she said as many as 200 people were expected to attend sundays 
ceremony 
i dont know how theyre going to get them all in the church

a state judge friday recommended a new trial for a 
man whose murder conviction had been questioned in the movie 
documentary the thin blue line 
district judge larry baraka said he will tell the texas court of 
criminal appeals that randall dale adams deserves a new trial the 
appeals court has the power to order the retrial 
adams has served 12 years in prison for the shooting of officer 
robert wood in 1976 he said he did not commit the crime 
much of the material being presented in the hearing this week on 
the retrial request was in the documentary which raised charges 
that witnesses in the original trial had lied 
im numb adams said after the judge issued his 
recommendation i dont know what to say right now im in 
shock 
adams attorney randy schaffer predicted that there would never 
be a retrial if the appeals court approves it theyve got no 
evidence theyve got no witnesses 
john creuzot an assistant prosecutor said he had confidence in 
the judge if thats the way he feels thats his call to make 
he said he said he had no idea if his office would indeed drop the 
charges if a retrial was ordered 
errol morris who made the thin blue line said im very 
happy about the judges decision i deeply believe in randall adams 
innocence obviously this man should not be in jail 
as reasons for a new trial baraka said the prosecution 
suppressed some evidence that would bolster the defense including a 
written statement from a witness emily miller who gave conflicting 
information about what she saw at the scene where wood was killed 
the state also kept suppressed the fact taht ms miller had picked 
someone other than adams when she viewed a police lineup

an iranian airliner only had 40 seconds to react 
to a warning before a us warship shot it down on july 3 killing 
all 290 people aboard a un aviation agency report was quoted as 
saying on friday 
the report prepared by the international civil aviation 
organization also confirms the us claim that several warnings were 
given to the a300 airbus before it was shot down in the persian 
gulf by the uss vincennes canadian press said 
the report also says however that only a warning from another 
american ship in the area the uss sides was coded specifically for 
iran air flight 655 cp said 
that warning came 40 seconds before the jet was destroyed by 
surfacetoair missiles cp quoted the report as saying 
a warning coded for the civilian aircraft could have been 
immediately recognizable to the flight crew but was given only in 
the final challenge the report said according to cp other 
warnings were sent on general military and civilian emergency radio 
frequencies 
cmdr dave thomas a defense department spokesman in washington 
said the pentagon had not received the report and would have no 
comment 
edmund stohr a us representative at the aviation organization 
refused comment friday but said in an interview thursday the united 
states considers the report fair 
airport officials in iran were unaware a skirmish between the 
vincennes and iranian gunboats in the gulf just before the airliner 
left bandar abbas for a flight across the waterway said the report 
which is to be presented to the agencys governing council monday 
no red alert status was in effect and the air traffic control 
units in tehran and bandar abbas were unaware of any activities at 
sea the report was quoted as saying 
a pentagon report blamed the downing of the airliner on human 
error by the crew of the vincennes which mistook the commercial jet 
for an iranian f14 fighter 
according to the pentagon report the plane was warned 12 times 
to change its course away from the battle zone 
the international civil aviation organizations report says the 
sophisticated aegis radar system on the vincennes recorded a 
flight profile consistent with a normal climb profile of an airbus 
a300 cp said the report says the plane was climbing normally 
from bandar abbas airport and was well within the lateral 
boundaries of the flight corridor across the gulf 
us navy investigators said september the iranian aircraft had 
been climbing until it was shot down 
the international civil aviation organizations report prepared 
at the request of a special meeting in july of the 33nation icao 
council is highly technical and does not fix blame it has been 
widely circulated at the agencys montreal headquarters

a federal judge friday accused fbi agents 
of misusing a federal grand jury subpoena to retaliate against a 
hispanic agent who filed a successful discrimination lawsuit against 
the bureau 
in a 17page memorandum us district judge lucius bunton ruled 
that fbi agents requested a grand jury subpoena during an internal 
investigation of agent bernardo perez after he and other hispanic 
agents sued the bureau there was no legitimite purpose for the 
subpoena he said 
the classaction lawsuit filed in january 1987 contended that the 
fbi promoted hispanic agents too slowly assigned them 
lessdesirable jobs and gave them little recognition for their 
successes bunton ruled in favor of the hispanic agents in 
september damages have not been determined 
in his 17page opinion friday the judge said a subpoena issued 
in february 1987 three weeks after the lawsuit was filed was 
requested without justification to gather telephone records on perez 
the allegation about the subpoena was brought up in august during 
the trial on the lawsuit but bunton postponed consideration of the 
issue because attorneys for the fbi said they were not prepared to 
respond to it 
when a hearing on the issue was held last month the fbi denied 
that the subpoena was requested in retaliation for the lawsuit 
but in his ruling friday bunton said the fbi did not state a 
legitimate nonretaliatory reason for securing the subpoena 
and that demonstrates that the securing of the grand jury subpoena 
was not legitimate 
to deny that there was not a close causal relationship between 
the grand jury subpoena and the filing of the title vii 
discrimination complaint is to fly in the face of reason bunton 
concluded 
perezs attorney antonio silva said buntons ruling was a 
significant finding in that it details retaliation against mr 
perez 
tom mcpoyle of the fbis headquarters in washington said friday 
that he couldnt comment on the judges ruling because of the 
ongoing litigation 
according to testimony at the hearing last month fbi officials 
began investigating perez in 1986 after he filed an internal 
discrimination complaint the investigation concerned statements 
perez had made at the espionage trial of a former fellow agent 
richard miller 
perez had testified that while he was secondincommand of the 
los angeles fbi office he recommended that his boss richard 
bretzing fire miller for incompetence bretzing denied that perez 
ever made that recommendation 
miller was not fired at the time and he was eventually convicted 
of passing secrets to the soviets 
an fbi agent in washington gary hart concluded that there was 
no evidence to bring criminal perjury charges against perez but he 
continued an administrative investigation into the agent 
in february 1987 hart asked a federal prosecutor in alexandria 
va to secure a subpoena of telephone records related to perez 
hart said he needed the subpoena to determine whether perez was 
telling the truth when he told hart he had tried to call him from a 
pay phone in virginia while en route to washington to meet with him 
to discuss the miller case 
but thejudge ruled friday that since the criminal investigation 
was over at that point the request for the subpoena was unjustified

the government shut down the yugoslav 
consulate in sydney on friday and ordered the consulate staff to 
leave the country after they refused to turn over a security guard 
who allegedly wounded a protester

officials to turn the guard over to australian police 
when the consulate refused to comply foreign minister gareth 
evans said that the staff of 12 and their families must leave 
australia by monday evening 
i deeply regret australia has been forced into this action by 
the refusal of the yugoslav government to allow the law to take its 
normal course he said 
in belgrade yugoslavia foreign minister budimir loncar strongly 
attacked australia for its actions 
in an interview with belgrade television he said australia had 
broken international conventions he said his government would 
demand satisfaction but gave no details and announced no 
retaliatory moves 
i must express my great satisfaction even pride that our 
consular staff honorably bravely decisively and in a dignified 
manner defended the sovereignty of their country the territory 
which belongs to us and the honor of our flag loncar said 
evans said his government reserved the right to claim 
compensation from yugoslav authorities for the family of 16yearold 
jospeh tokic who was shot in the throat during a demonstration 
outside the consulate sunday yugoslav national day

in a harsh rebuke to its host country the 
general assembly on friday voted to move a meeting to geneva so it 
can hear an address by plo chairman yasser arafat who was denied a 
visa to enter the united states 
the assembly voted 1542 to hold the session in geneva on dec 
1315 the united states and israel were the only nations voting 
against the measure 
britain abstained it has said the united states should allow 
arafat to speak but opposed the harsh criticism of the united states 
in the un resolution 
the unprecedented shift to geneva was ordered because the united 
states rejected un appeals to reconsider and admit arafat who it 
accuses of being an accessory to terrorism 
arafat sought to address the 159nation world body here this week 
during its annual debate on palestine 
he was to have addressed the general assembly on thursday in new 
york to discuss recent decisions of the palestine national council 
in algiers to declare an independent palestinian state and accept 
un resolutions which implicitly recognize israels right to exist 
the meeting in geneva would be the first time the united nations 
has convened a regular session outside new york city since the 
general assembly first moved into its permanent manhattan 
headquarters which opened in 1952 
between 1946 and 1952 the united nations held sessions primarily 
in new york but also met twice in paris and once its first meeting 
in london 
absent from fridays roll call were dominica and south africa 
south africa because of its policies of racial apartheid was 
stripped of its voting rights in 1974 
after the vote the highestranking us official at the united 
nations undersecretarygeneral joseph verner reed sent a personal 
letter to president reagan appealing to him to let arafat speak 
the letter was widely but not officially circulated and reed 
said he was not responsible for leaking it to the press 
the bottom line mr president is that the action to deny a 
visa to an invited guest of the united nations has done 
incalculable damage to united states credibility in the world 
arena 
reed said the united states is a proponent of free speech all 
over the world yet it will not permit chairman arafat to enter the 
united states to speak in a public forum on international territory 
 
does this spell the end of the united nations in the united 
states and the united states in the united nations 
israels acting ambassador johanan bein had urged the general 
assembly to reject the measure 
this assembly is asked to pack its bags and go to another 
continent for the dubious pleasure of lending an ear to the person 
who conceived instigated and organized some of the worlds 
cruellest atrocities against the innocent citizens of many nations 
us ambassador herbert s okun said the change of venue is 
unnecessary nevertheless we would not oppose such a move and the 
united states would be represented if a meeting were held in 
geneva 
he said the united states was justified in denying a visa to 
arafat 
plo envoy zuhdi labib terzi said once again within hours the 
international body in this community has stood together for what is 
right against what is wrong 
he said the plo would have preferred to meet in new york it is 
only because of the intransigence of the host country and its lack 
of respect for international law that it has to pick up the bill of 
more than a million dollars 
he was referring to transportation costs of all delegations 
above the un estimate of 645500 
the threeday meeting at genevas stately palais de nations the 
un european headquarters will require an additional appropriation 
of 440700 but about 204800 in other costs can be absorbed in 
the existing budget un officials said 
the united states probably would be expected to pay a quarter of 
the additional cost in accordance with its onefourth share of the 
regular annual budget it has said it would participate in the 
geneva session 
the united nations is facing a financial crisis caused largely 
by the us indebtedness of about 500 million the united states is 
the biggest un contributor and its biggest debtor nation 
on wednesday the assembly overwhelmingly deplored the us denial 
of a visa to arafat to speak in new york it gave the united states 
24 hours to reconsider and reverse its decision 
on thursday night the us government defied the un resolution 
and rejected its appeal saying the decision to bar arafat was final 
arafat who visited the united nations in 1974 was barred from 
visiting the un on international territory by secretary of state 
george p shultz on grounds that he is an accessory to terrorism 
the united nations says that by denying arafat a visa the united 
states has violated the 1947 usun headquarters agreement under 
which the united states is obligated to grant visas to un guests

a lawyer for a couple who believe a 
10yearold sarasota girl is their daughter said friday that he has 
medical records to support their claim and a judge gave the couple 
permission to get more records 
regina and ernest twigg maintain their daughter was switched 
after birth in hardee memorial hospital with a sickly child and that 
records were altered to hide the swap 
the twiggs of langhorne pa named the baby they took home 
arlena and raised her until her death in august from heart disease 
just before she died they learned through genetic tests that arlena 
was not their biological daughter her bpositive blood type didnt 
match their type o 
kimberly mays was the only other white girl born at the same time 
at hardee memorial her mother died soon after brith the girl has 
been raised by her father robert a sarasota roofing supply 
salesman who is fighting efforts by the twiggs to challenge 
parentage 
attorney john blakely made only passing reference to the medical 
records at a hearing 
but outside the courthouse he said he had documents from hardee 
memorial showing barbara mays had type b blood and the child she 
bore was bpositive the baby also was born with fetal stress and 
bluish extremities conditions consistent with heart problems 
blakely said 
everything in the records indicates we are correct in assuming 
mrs mays delivered arlena twigg blakely said hospital records 
indicate mrs twigg delivered a baby with opositive 
blakely doesnt know yet kimberlys blood type 
however circuit judge andy owen granted the twiggs motions for 
hospital medical records on kimberlys birth and mrs mays 
pregnancy and delivery and the results if any of any genetic 
testing that has been done 
the judge also said blakely could take sworn statements from 
medical and custodial personnel at the hospital to document records 
it was a very successful day in terms of proceeding in this 
matter blakely said 
the judge denied motions by mays attorney arthur ginsburg to 
dismiss the case and force the twiggs to state beforehand whether 
they intend to seek custody 
the twiggs want a judicial decree that kimberly is their 
daughter the judge said they have to establish their rights to 
her before a decision can be made on parentage 
i think were doing it backwards ginsburg told the judge 
we are saying to kimberly were going to find out who your 
parents are and then who is going to have custody of you 
she does not want to meet the twiggs she doesnt want to have 
her blood tested she wants to stay with her father no one has 
asked her what she wants

two female hostages were released unharmed 
friday by two inmates who took them hostage and demanded to meet 
with reporters over conditions at the overcrowded wyoming state 
penitentiary 
abdula amin 37 and don calkins 25 gave up without so much 
as a bad word said warden duane shillinger after the inmates 
540 pm surrender they apologized for what they did and they 
are not even certain why they did it 
the prisoners initially sought a news conference to air their 
grievances but surrendered without incident almost 11 hours after 
taking the women captive 
mr amin said at one point we dont know why we did it it 
got started and we couldnt stop it shillinger said the two 
inmates were taken to the carbon county jail pending the filing of 
charges against them 
the two inmates were wielding knives fashioned from a scissors 
blade and a razor blade when they took counselors barbara france and 
betty lewis hostage shortly after 7 am during sick call in the 
prisons maximumsecurity unit 
the inmates both serving sentences for sexual assault 
convictions bound themselves to the women with tape and held them 
captive in a counseling room shillinger said 
my mouth is very dry weve been through a very emotional 
day shillinger said after meeting with the women im not 
ashamed to say that when i saw those women walk out the door i 
broke down and cried were so glad this turned out in the manner it 
did 
prison officials including an fbitrained negotiator spoke with 
the inmates by telephone through the day friday but shillinger said 
any demands beyond those for food would not be granted unless the 
women were released 
reporters from wyoming and colorado flocked to the penitentiary 
in the afternoon but prison officials kept their presence secret 
from the inmates 
photographers and television camera operators were prevented from 
taking pictures 
associate warden al urie said amin began serving an eight to 
20year sentence on a conviction of firstdegree sexual assault and 
a life term for a habitual offender conviction in december 1983 
calkins began serving an eight to 15year sentence on two 
convictions of firstdegree sexual assault and aggravated burglary 
in april 1985 
neither amin nor calkins had created major problems at the prison 
in the past urie said 
france has worked at the prison about three years and lewis 
started there last month said shillinger 
the penitentiary built because of overcrowding in the states 
old prison was full soon after opening in 1981 additions and 
mobile units were constructed in the yard but the prison population 
has continued to fill the available space 
a report issued last fall said the current penitentiary capacity 
of 710 inmates was exceeded in august 1987 and january 1988 prison 
officials projected the population would reach 800 prisoners by this 
fall and 900 by may 1990 officials were not able to immediately 
provide the current headcount at the prison

despite the threat of a lawsuit 
georgias wilderness scouts have decided to remain autonomous rather 
than affiliate with the national boy scouts and girl scouts 
the directors of the wilderness scouts of america inc voted 
unanimously thursday to keep both their name and mission said 
harold cornwell founder of the organization for underprivileged 
youngsters 
the boy scouts of america had threatened to sue the wilderness 
scouts over their use of the word scout which the boy scouts 
claim the rights to 
but on monday boy scout officials offered to charter the 
wilderness scouts as an affiliate of the national organization 
under the plan female wilderness scouts would have become girl 
scouts and male wilderness scouts would become boy scouts 
cornwell said his 45member group decided to remain separate in 
part because of a child molestation case involving one of his 
scouts the stepfather of the scout was sentenced thursday to 20 
years plus fines for aggravated sodomy 
we were instrumental in bringing this case forward cornwell 
said we noticed he was distraught and crying in the meetings 
that little boy would never have been able to join the boy 
scouts cornwell said he didnt even have a bed he slept on 
the floor who would have paid his dues some of our kids dont even 
have a toothbrush thats third world poverty as far as im 
concerned 
cornwell said his groups volunteer attorney who specializes in 
patent and copyright law says keep on with our mission 
wayne brock executive director of the boy scouts northeast 
georgia council said boy scout officials had hoped the dispute 
would be settled by chartering cornwells scouts he said further 
action will have to be determined by national boy scout officials 
were not opposed to their activities brock said the only 
issue is the use of the word scout 
cornwell a disabled vietnam veteran founded the group five 
years ago to help children with backgrounds similar to his own he 
was raised in a oneparent home after his father was murdered and 
he could not afford a boy scout uniform or badges as a youth 
wilderness scouts have no dues uniforms or badges but are 
active in conservation and service in the community

yugoslavias consul general in chicago was ordered 
to appear in a philadelphia court saturday for a hearing on charges 
he took part in a money laundering scheme 
a 17month sting operation culminated thursday with the 
announcement of a 21count indictment naming bahrudin bijedic 52 
and four other men along with lbs bank of new york inc the us 
branch of a yugoslavian bank 
at a hearing in chicago friday bijedic was released from custody 
but ordered to remain in the company of us customs officials until 
saturdays appearance in philadelphia 
i want you to be able to travel not in the context of a 
prisoner but you will have to follow the directions of the agents 
who accompany you said us magistrate bernard weisberg 
saturdays hearing will be to consider bond and issues of 
diplomatic immunity weisberg said 
the yugoslavian embassy in washington issued a statement saying 
it was distressed that something like that could happen to a 
diplomatic officer and that any diplomat might provide grounds for 
such allegations 
the embassy emphasized its desire for good relations with the 
united states and said the department of state made clear that 
the action was directed solely at the individuals named in the 
indictment and not against the yugoslav diplomatic and consular 
missions in the united states and the yugoslav government 
in belgrade yugoslavia the foreign ministry presented a 
demarche to the us state department expecting explanation and 
additional information on the incident according to a statement 
carried by the state news agency tanjug 
bijedic who became consul general in chicago in 1985 is not 
protected by diplomatic immunity because the charges are that his 
actions were not official functions of the consulate said ana 
marija besker a spokeswoman for the embassy 
us customs commissioner william von raab said bijedic may have 
been acting under the instructions of superiors but said 
authorities had no evidence to that effect 
i hope that this investigation will serve as a notice to other 
government agencies that the east bloc is still desperate to get its 
hands not only on our high technology but our hard currency von 
raab said 
the 21count indictment said us undercover agents gave nearly 
15 million in cash to the five men to be laundered the men who 
believed the money came from organized crime and was to be used to 
pay for exporting restricted high technology and military equipment 
helped conceal its origin by depositing the cash abroad then wiring 
it back to us bank accounts officials said 
the charges detailed eight transactions totaling 147 million 
in all the cases money was carried to foreign countries 
particularly yugoslavia and transferred back to the united states 
electronically under the names of phony corporations officials said 
in at least one transaction bijedic provided the men with 
diplomatic stickers that forbade us officials from opening 
suitcases containing 500000 in small bills according to the 
customs service 
the use of diplomatic or consular pouches is a serious problem 
with respect to hightech diversions and obviously here now its 
been seen to be a possible moneylaundering device von raab said 
all five men were charged with violating currency reporting laws 
the arms export and control act and conspiracy customs officials 
said 
indicted were bijedic 52 vjekoslov spanjol 31 a naturalized 
us citizen from texas vinko mir 54 chairman of lbs bank hubert 
francis cole 44 of carrollton texas and larry card 50 of 
chattanooga tenn 
if convicted cole faces up to 230 years in jail and a 106 
million fine officials said spanjol faces up to 100 years in jail 
and a 51 million fine if convicted and bijedic card and mir face 
up to five years in jail and a 250000 fine officials said 
cole and spanjol were being held in federal custoday in 
philadelphia pending a bail hearing on monday 
card arrested thursday night in chattanooga will be taken to 
philadelphia for a bail hearing after appearing before a federal 
magistrate officials said 
assistant us attorney paul sarmousakis the case prosecutor 
said friday he expected that mir and card will all appear in 
philadelphia federal court early next week

added i dont see any reason why we would want to hold them 
he said the soviet union and israel did not have an extradition 
treaty but he said both nations have signed international treaties 
on punishing and extraditing airplane hijackers 
the hijacking came at a sensitive time in sovietisraeli 
relations which gradually have been improving since moscow severed 
them during the 1967 middle east war 
the hijackers surrendered at 615 pm 1115 am est about 35 
minutes after the aeroflot ilyushin76 touched down guided by 
israeli air force jets us officials were on the runway as was 
the head of a soviet delegation temporarily based in israel

and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad albert

three pistols and an automatic rifle demanded a huge sum of money 
and an airliner for a flight out of the country in exchange for 
the hostages the bus was taken to the local airport but there was 
not a big enough plane there so the hijackers took off from 
neighboring mineralniye vodi tass said

armenians and a resident of the ossetian soviet republic near 
turkey army officials said they knew while the plane was still in 
the air that there were no soviet jews aboard

israel south africa or pakistan israeli officials said iraq and 
egypt was also on the list 
flight engineer yermilov said that during the flight the 
hijackers played cards and kept an eye on the crew but did not 
threaten them 
shortl after the plane landed army officials said one hijacker 
came out and was met by two negotiators 
three crew members then emerged and joined the discussions which 
ended with the hijacker giving up a handgun the officials said the 
rest of the eightmember crew then came out and the drama ended 
an unidentified crew member told israel army radio that seconds 
before the surrender one of the hijackers asked is this israel 
or syria when they heard israel they said they would stay 
maj gen amram mitzna a senior army commander said the 
hijackers demanded proof that they were in israel they said 
wait a minute we want to see something in yiddish or at least a 
star of david he said 
rabin told reporters that the hijackers had a sawedoff shotgun 
and four pistols but did not use force once they landed

presidentelect george bush will have on wednesday lt gen colin 
d powell said reagan looks forward to one final session with the 
general secretary to note the stable relationship that exists now 
the improving relationship and allow the vice president to continue 
to build on that relationship 
he said the us contingent is ready for but he doesnt expect 
any repetition of gorbachevs pattern of surprise at the hurried 
summit in reykjavik iceland two years ago it was there that the 
soviet leader caught the americans off guard with sweeping proposals 
that included the virtual elimination of strategic nuclear arsenals 
powell applauded the recent soviet decision to stop jamming 
broadcasts of the voice of america and other western programs and 
he said that us officials were heartened by the kremlins decision 
to release scores of refuseniks but he said the united states still 
wants to see the soviet institutionalize human rights reforms 
the threestar army officer who soon will be promoted to the 
rank of general and will return to active duty with command 
responsibility for all troops stationed in this country was asked 
what us officials would do if gorbachev sprang a surprise 
reminiscent of reykjavik 
i dont know that we have to ensure against a surprise he 
replied but powell also said that we have seen them try to turn a 
flank from time to time 
and i think we would be prepared to deal with any surprise 
that they might come up with take it under advisement without 
feeling that were under any pressure during a twoandahalf 
lunch period to necessarily respond in a substantive way to 
something that had not been anticipated he said 
deputy soviet foreign minister vladimir petrovsky told a press 
briefing in moscow on friday that afghanistan central america and 
the middle east are among the items gorbachev will discuss with 
reagan and bush

will detail the soviet leaderships views on major issues of world 
development 
us officials were widely criticized in the wake of the summit 
in iceland which collapsed when reagan and gorbachev disagreed over 
the soviet leaders demand that the us president substantially 
downgrade reagans star wars missiledefense program 
powell said that us officials do not know why gorbachev is 
traveling on to cuba after leaving this country 
i really would hope that he would recognize that until 
something is done with respect to the problem presented to us by 
cuba and nicaragua we will always have an irritant in our 
relationship the national security adviser said we cannot 
go as far as we would like to go with respect to the solution of 
regional problems 
petrovsky said all the meetings on gorbachevs trip which 
includes visits with fidel castro in cuba and with prime minister

at least one of the five women whose 
skeletons have been found along highways in southeastern 
massachusetts since july may have been involved with drugs or 
prostitution in this port city authorities said friday 
theyre all murder victims no doubt about it said bristol 
county district attorney ronald a pina 
authorities suspect a serial killer may be responsible because 
the skeletal remains were found in a six to eightmile radius in 
dense woods within 25 feet of interstate 195 and route 140 and all 
are believed to be women 
a seattle detective spoke with new bedford authorities by 
telephone on friday to determine if there are any links between the 
massachusetts slayings and the socalled green river killer 
blamed for 48 deaths in washington prior to 1984 
the green river killer so called because many of the victims 
bodies were found near the seattlearea river preyed mostly on 
prostitutes or transients 
bob evans commander of the green river task force in seattle 
said there was no evidence to link the cases and that it was 
routine for the task force to exchange information with other 
jurisdictions investigating serial killings 
another body was discovered friday in dennis about 50 miles east 
of new bedford on cape cod but bristol county officials said they 
had no idea if it could be connected to the five bodies found in the 
new bedford area 
the body that of a 37yearold man was found next to a syringe 
and needle 
investigators had to suspend a search of the highway area because 
the trained dogs they were using were distracted by television 
camera crews pina said 
a woman whose skeleton was found tuesday had been reported 
missing in the summer and had been dead at least three months pina 
said he said her name was being withheld until relatives could be 
notified 
three of the missing women were reported last seen in the weld 
square area known by police as a center for local drug trading and 
prostitution in this fishing port of about 98000 people about 50 
miles south of boston 
some of the missing people that possibly are going to be 
identified were in the community at some point in the drug 
community or prostitution community pina said at a news 
conference 
i dont have a doubt that they are all related in one way or 
another as to the commonality of how they died where they died 
the condition in which we found them and the locations in which we 
found them pina said 
investigators have loose suspects in the case including men 
who had used prostitutes in new bedford 
we have some people we are looking at very seriously the 
question is who knew all these people he said 
pina said one victim was strangled the cause of death in some of 
the others had been determined but he would not disclose those 
results 
the remains of all five women are be sent to the fbi for further 
examination to more accurately determine the cause of death and 
learn other details 
pina spokesman thomas gibney said police used searchlights 
thursday night but found no evidence to help the investigation they 
resumed searching friday morning 
were hoping we found the last of them and we just have to put 
some of the pieces together gibney said 
he said investigators believe the fifth victim was a woman 
because of the style of the clothing found dungarees and a light 
shirt he said the body was severely decomposed and may have been 
there a year 
all of the bodies were so badly decomposed that none could be 
identified as female on sight gibney said 
the first three were spotted by motorists who pulled over on the 
shoulders of the highways authorities said 
state police and the district attorneys office intensified their 
investigation after the third body was discovered nov 8 off a ramp 
from interstate 195 in dartmouth not far from where the second body 
was found july 30 
a german shepherd owned by connecticut state police joined 
massachusetts state police dogs in the search tuesday and found the 
fourth body near the same ramp the ramp is about two miles west of 
the route 140 exit on the interstate 
the dog turned up the fifth body less than three miles south of 
where the first body was discovered july 3 
pina has said the five bodies might be linked to the deaths of 
two suspected prostitutes from providence ri whose bodies were 
found last spring near two interstate highways

five men who fled cuba in the 1980 
freedom flotilla only to be imprisoned for crimes were 
returned to their homeland friday in the first deportations under a 
pact that set off fiery prison riots last year 
the five handcuffed cubans watched by two guards each took off 
from birmingham municipal airport in a us marshals service boeing 
727 that held about 50 people for the 90minute flight to an airport 
near havana 
the plane landed without incident turned over the detainees to 
cuban authorities and returned to the united states said joe 
krovisky a justice department spokesman in washington everything 
went smoothly he said 
the cubans the first of 2500 the government wants to deport 
had been kept at the federal prison at talladega 60 miles east of 
birmingham pending a final ruling on deportation 
the flight had been scheduled for thursday but was delayed when 
cuba asked for more time to prepare for the five all of whom had 
committed crimes in the united states three of the five lost a 
series of court fights in their effort to avoid going home 
deborah vurstionwade a justice department spokeswoman said a 
number of officials were on the flight including john a simon of 
the immigration and naturalization service and talladega warden don 
southerland because we consider this a training exercise for the 
department we hope to have many of these flights 
when the cubans got off the plane ms vurstionwade said three 
of them knelt down and kissed the ground 
the us officials got off the airplane ms vurstionwade said 
and exchanged documents and a manifest with the cubans 
all went as well as planned she said it was very 
organized deliberate and very professional there were absolutely 
no problems 
she said about 20 cuban officials met the five returnees and put 
them on a bus but that she did not know where they were taken 
during the flight she said the cubans were described as very 
quiet they remained handcuffed and shackled but not to their 
seats 
the cuban news agency prensa latina quoted an interior ministry 
official as saying cuban authorities immediately began procedures 
to study the detainees judicial situation 
the dispatch monitored in mexico city did not say where the 
cubans were taken one of them shouted viva cuba after 
getting off the plane prensa latina said 
the repatriation of the five prisoners is included in the 
migration accords signed by havana and washington in 1984 but 
interrupted by legal problems in the united states the report 
said 
it said the five had been declared undesireables by the 
united states 
the us supreme court voted 81 friday to reject an emergency 
request by three of the cubans to remain in the united states 
justice thurgood marshall cast the dissenting vote with none of the 
justices commenting 
attorneys for the three claimed they would be persecuted if sent 
home the other two did not fight deportation 
the deportations were the first since a 1987 agreement was 
reached between the united states and cuban president fidel castro 
to resume the repatriations 
that pact set off 11 days of rioting in november 1987 at federal 
prisons in atlanta and oakdale la with 125 people held hostage 
one inmate slain and heavy property damages to both institutions 
as the riots ended the cuban inmates were dispersed to other 
prisons including 114 to talladega 
there have been no reports of any inmate resistance to the latest 
deportation proceedings 
a federal judge at birmingham is to rule by monday whether 10 
other cubans at talladega will be deported 
the repatriation program for 2746 cubans was suspended at 
castros insistence in 1985 after 201 were returned 
in the 1980 boatlift about 125000 people some of them convicts 
or mentally ill sailed illegally from mariel cuba to the united 
states 
the united states wants to return as many as 2500 of the 
remaining marielitos either as excludable aliens or those 
convicted of serious crimes in this country 
the five cubans were miguel beitiasocarraz 28 who pleaded 
guilty to seconddegree burglary onel calzadogarlobo 43 
convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault involving a 
13yearold girl rene maurinoliva 25 who pleaded guilty to theft 
and battery and hector hernandezquesada and angel 
meneseshernandez who did not fight the deportation and about whom 
little was known 
in atlanta carla dudeck coordinator for the coalition to 
support cuban detainees said fridays deportations likely will open 
the gates for more 
the legal suits we filed didnt work she said 
on what treatment the deportees might face in cuba she said 
all we have to base it on is those who went back in 1985 about a 
third are still in jail and we dont know why or what they are doing 
there 
castro called them traitors to the revolution when they left 
the country then in 1984 he said those who came back would be 
treated humanitarily its hard to take all he says literally and 
its hard to get information from cuba 
the deportation agreement calls for up to 100 cubans a month to 
be returned about 500 detainees remain in custody among the 2746 
that cuba agreed to take back in 1984 ms dudeck said the others 
have been paroled some of the 500 still have appeals left open to 
them

share prices soared to a record close on the tokyo 
stock exchange saturday as the market expressed relief from the 
threat of a interest rate hike dealers said 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 13325 
points or 045 percent to close saturdays halfday session at 
2966550 its highest closing ever 
the main economic barometer opened the weeks trading with a 
major setback of 38027 points monday but soared in later trading 
days to close 30191 points or 102 percent above last weeks 
finish 
players were somewhat cautious until the release of us 
unemployment rate yesterday friday and that seemed to have 
prevented the upsurge of share prices even though the market 
sentiment is still quite bullish said a dealer at nikko 
securities co 
he said saturdays gain reflects the relief the market felt from 
worry that the us federal reserve board may raise interest rates 
to calm the heated economy and fear of inflation 
but with the slight increase in the jobless rate the anxiety 
appeared to have been eased for the time being he said 
the us labor department released a report friday showing the 
american jobless rate for november increased to 54 percent from 
octobers 53 percent 
volume on the first section of the exchange where most major 
shares are listed was estimated at 600 million shares the previous 
nikkei high was reached wednesday when the index closed at 2957890 
points 
the foreign exchange market is closed on saturdays

long island lighting cos board of 
directors said friday it would consider a proposed agreement to sell 
and close the shoreham nuclear plant despite the legislatures 
failure to approve the deal 
but the board reaffirmed that it would not renegotiate the 
agreement and would vigorously continue to pursue a fullpower 
license from the nuclear regulatory commission 
the legislature failed to meet a thursday deadline on the 
agreement which calls for the state to buy the 53 billion plant 
from lilco for 1 then close it 
in return the utility would be granted yearly rate increases of 
roughly 5 percent for the next 10 years legislators opposing the 
settlement said it placed an unfair burden on ratepayers 
the lilco board said friday that if the settlement is approved 
before the nrc grants a 25 percent or fullpower operating license 
the utility would stick to the agreement unless the passage of 
time has materially disadvantaged lilcos shareholders or 
customers 
the utility said that because the legislature missed the 
deadline it would ignore the part of the agreement restricting it 
from operating the shoreham plant above 5 percent power if the nrc 
authorizes higher operation 
in albany gov mario cuomo said lilco officials had exercised 
every option open to them 
what did they give the state and the legislature nothing 
cuomo said if i were their attorney i would be very proud of 
what ive done here today and id be saying to them look i got 
you everything 
william j catacosinos lilco chairman and chief executive 
officer said the board was disappointed by the legislatures 
inaction 
we believe it is important to end the controversy surrounding 
shoreham so that lilco and state and local officials can work 
together to resolve the energy shortages on long island 
catacosinos said 
legislators maintain that a settlement could still be approved 
within the next few weeks 
cuomo said his administration would continue to oppose the nrc 
licensing 
the shoreham plant was completed in 1985 a decade late and at 
seven times the original estimated cost it has been prevented from 
operating at full power because the state and suffolk county refuse 
to join in emergency evacuation planning 
the plant located on the northshore of long island about 90 
miles from new york city is now licensed to run at up to 5 percent 
of full power

troops with mortar rounds and rifle fire friday at an army base 
outside the capital and the government later said the twoday

rights violations of fellow officers 
the government reported one rebel killed dyn an independent 
news agency said several rebels also were wounded no government 
casualties were reported

seineldin gave up friday night

episodes and has subordinated himself to the army command

following a meeting with the defense minister and army chief 
there was no type of negotiation he said 
martinez said rebels remained holed up at an infantry school on 
the sprawling campo de mayo base outside the capital he said that 
seineldin agreed to try to convince them to accept defeat after 
loyalists fired a few mortar rounds near the school fatally 
wounding one rebel the mutineers fired automatic rifles at the 
loyalists 
at least four army tanks entered the base according to the 
reports rebels who planted mines at the infantry school entrances 
began removing them after seineldin asked for a truce 
the insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the campo 
de mayo now accept the orders of the army chief lt gen jose

a truce of two weeks during which no sanctions will be taken 
against anyone the rebel did not give his name nor explain what 
he meant by a truce

between the two sides the official news agency telam reported and 
five people were injured including a 19yearold woman who was shot 
in the neck and stomach as she walked near the base 
the soldiers seized the infantry school on thursday 
 
this is not a coup against the government but a fight to 
restore military honor to the army and review the trials that punish 
the just and promote the guilty seineldin had told reporters 
inside the base 
civilian trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during 
the 197683 juntaruled military dictatorships are resuming 
seineldin said he commanded 400 soldiers and he apparently also 
commanded 53 coast guard men who deserted their base thursday the 
coast guard men drove onto the infantry school grounds friday

the apparent hope of avoiding bloodshed

unconcerned about the mutiny and commented in spanish that his 
troops would suffocate the uprising 
he told the assembly that if developed nations want to encourage 
democracy in latin america they ought to provide debt relief so new 
democracies are not overthrown by tyrants 
unsatisfied expectations generate desperation which always 
favors the adventures of the authoritarians alfonsin said 
alfonsin whose election in 1983 ended military rule that began 
with a coup in 1976 flew to washington on thursday evening and 
conferred with presidentelect george bush at bushs home alfonsin

the fbi says a sting operation that began in 
a small suburban buffalo storefront knocked out a massive american 
and sicilian mafia drug operation that was selling millions of 
dollars worth of heroin in the united states and cocaine in italy 
some of the heroin was shipped as liquefied heroin in wine 
bottles from italy officials said 
although the international food trading company set up by agents 
three years ago never handled any drug shipments it allowed the fbi 
to establish contacts with organized crime operations in the united 
states and italy g robert langford special agent in charge of the 
fbis buffalo office said thursday 
as a result of the investigation which broadened to include fbi 
offices nationwide the fbi and italian authorities have charged 
more than 200 people in a multimilliondollar heroin importation and 
cocaine distribution operation involving sicilian mafia figures and 
the gambino crime family in new york

the british government has 
officially endorsed the idea of bringing roman catholic and 
protestant children together in the classroom as a way of bridging 
the sectarianism that bloodies northern ireland 
the headmaster of one such integrated school told recently of one 
classroom incident that led him to believe the initiative might at 
least bring better understanding between the feuding catholic and 
protestant communities in the british province 
the incident involved an irish republican army funeral in march 
when two british soldiers were dragged from a car and killed at the 
cemetery catholic and protestant students came to class in anger 
afterward 
here was your acid test for integrated education said the 
headmaster terence flanagan of lagan college where catholic and 
protestant children 11 to 17 years old learn together 
the students talked about it and while they didnt agree 
they realized there was a difference of opinion and they didnt feel 
they had to go for one another 
historically education in northern ireland has reflected the 
provinces divisions more than 99 percent of youngsters attend 
either state schools which are almost entirely protestant or 
churchrun catholic schools 
but after decades on the sidelines the government took a 
landmark decision oct 5 to endorse integrated education like that 
at lagan the reason says the provinces education minister dr 
brian mawhinney was that a growing number of parents onethird 
according to a recent poll wanted it 
integrated schools part of a wider program by prime minister 
margaret thatchers government to encourage crosscommunity contact 
is the key element of the biggest shakeup of northern irish 
education for 40 years 
as a sign of londons official backing for the reforms princess 
anne visited lagan college in late november and talked with the 
students 
the reforms expected to become law by 1990 will for the first 
time also require all children to study the same course material in 
all subjects 
schools now can develop their own courses while they are similar 
because students take the same national exams catholic schools tend 
to focus more on irish history and writers while protestant schools 
favor english history and literature 
mawhinney said working parties would be set up to chart a common 
curriculum but that wont be easy since key episodes of irish 
history are highly contentious 
the battle of the boyne in 1688 for instance is a glorious 
event in protestant minds because it established protestant 
hegemony in ireland to catholics it was a disaster 
but according to robin glendinning a teacher at a protestant 
school students tend to absorb a neutral version of history while 
simultaneously continuing to believe myths that directly conflict 
with the facts 
the facts and myths that kids hold on to are two entirely 
separate areas he said in an interview 
said carol nobel an 18yearold student at the protestant 
grosevenor high school however much we all pretend that were 
objective its still in you you still have a bias you grew up 
with it 
mawhinney stressed that the government had no intention of 
forcing integration since northern irelands population 
distribution makes it impossible to set up integrated schools in 
some areas 
only 1000 of the countrys 350000 students now attend 
integrated schools mawhinney predicted the percentage will increase 
but said the government wasnt setting any targets 
integrated education is not a panacea for northern irelands 
future mawhinney said in an interview 
nevertheless as more children go through the process its 
bound to have an effect on society and we think that effect will be 
positive and make it easier to tackle the political and security and 
economic problems that this province faces 
criticism from both catholics and protestants has been muted so 
far 
monsignor colm mccaughan director of the council for catholic 
maintained schools said he had no objection to parents voluntarily 
sending their children to mixed schools but did not believe 
integration would solve the provinces difficulties 
i think society itself has to be integrated before therell be 
any real change he added political affiliations play a much 
stronger role than religious affiliations 
mccaughan said it was impossible to integrate schools in the 
urban ghettos where violence is most prevalent and where religiously 
mixed classes might be most beneficial 
the main opposition from the catholic church and from some 
protestant politicians is the governments plan to give financial 
preference to integrated schools 
mawhinney said the government wants to provide a very small 
element of retrospective justice to integrated schools which do 
not qualify for government support until they have proved themselves 
viable over a period of several years 
flanagan said lagan college founded in 1981 and the oldest of 
the provinces integrated schools was not a social experiment 
or the answer to northern irelands problems but a symbol of what 
is possible 
young people can live together their parents can live together 
and they dont just have to be nice middleclass parents who play 
golf and go to rugby clubs he said it can be done and we are 
showing the way 
flanagan said students will leave lagan as mildly or as 
militantly protestant or catholic as when they arrived but 
capable of understanding respecting the point of view of the 
other person because they know that other person as a person

in the unstable world of acting tess harper has 
come to appreciate a sure thing 
its hard to establish a routine as an actor said harper 
who broke onto the movie scene five years ago playing opposite 
robert duvall in tender mercies 
you can only be certain that this job is going to end and 
youre going to have get another one thats why people go into soap 
operas or television series its safe 
so when playwrightactor sam shepard offered her a part in the 
comedydrama far north which he wrote and directed harper 
accepted without even reading the script 
it was just the thrill of being asked by him because i respect 
his opinion greatly i felt honored that my capabilities matched up 
to his writing she said 
harpers journey to hollywood began in mammoth springs ark 
with detours through springfield mo houston and dallas mammoth 
springs where she lived until leaving for college in the late 
1960s has a population of just under 1200 
i certainly knew where the road leading out of town was but i 
left reluctantly she recalled you grow up in a place where 
nothing ever changes and the thing you become most afraid of in your 
life is any change 
but since leaving her hometown harper has faced changes many 
changes she attended southwest missouri state in springfield moved 
to houston and became involved with the local theater 
sometimes i directed sometimes i was the stage manager she 
recalled the thing about doing that type of theater is youre 
involved on every level you might have the lead in one show and 
work box office the next 
in the early 80s harper moved to dallas determined to further 
her career after making commercials and industrial films the 
casting director for tender mercies spotted her and recommended 
that she be tested for the young widow who falls in love with a 
countryandwestern singer duvall 
it was like winning the lottery said harper now a resident 
of beverly hills calif director bruce beresford and duvall 
treated me as if i knew precisely what i was doing if they had any 
doubts they kept it to themselves 
harpers lucky streak continued when she landed a small role in 
the enormously successful silkwood which starred cher meryl 
streep and kurt russell she has also appeared in two tv miniseries 
chiefs and celebrity and the film flashpoint 
in 1986 harper appeared in the movie adaptation of beth henleys 
play crimes of the heart which starred diane keaton jessica 
lange and sissy spacek as the eccentric mcgrath sisters 
crimes was summer camp and we had such a great time with each 
other said harper whose portrayal of the meddlesome cousin chick 
earned her an academy award nomination for supporting actress 
i think it was easier for me because i was the only supporting 
role and here were these three women in the leads every time those 
women work anywhere you have to watch because their work is so 
exceptional she said 
harper developed close friendships with lange and shepard who 
also had a supporting role in crimes and was happy to have the 
chance to work with them again 
i knew it would be a really good working relationship you form 
a community if you trust the people youre with then you know the 
community is going to be there 
in far north lange and harper are sisters who battle each 
other and their father charles durning as they struggle to find 
direction in their lives 
what i liked about the character was her anger ive always 
played very sane very earthy characters the character of rita 
isnt focused at all shes taking a break from her life 
something harper can directly relate to 
ive done it but it doesnt last very long my ability to pity 
myself has about an eightweek limit 
although harper thinks of acting as a joyful experience she 
confesses to usually coming down with a strong case of nerves before 
starting any film 
there comes a time before shooting or rehearsals where i panic 
and think im no good and the projects no good but if youre 
lucky the feeling doesnt last very long 
and how nervous could she be about making far north with 
shepard writing and directing and lange costarring well the 
actual story was just fine but harper worried about getting it on 
film because of weather conditions in minnesota where the movie was 
shot 
hopefully everytime you walk on the set youre going to learn 
something from somebody the actress said i would be perfectly 
happy to do sam shepardbruce beresford films for the rest of my 
life

edward herrmann americas favorite acting preppy 
is once again wearing a suit and tie onstage but thats an 
occupational hazard when youre thin and welleducated and take 
naturally to the look 
i can wear a suit its the kiss of death joked herrmann 
who dons one nightly opposite alec guinness in lee blessings 
twocharacter play a walk in the woods now at the comedy 
theater 
he plays an american arms negotiator named honeyman strolling 
through the woods of geneva enmeshed in talks with his soviet 
counterpart andrey botvinnik played by guinness 
i dont know how i got stuck in this preppy mold said the 
actor who specializes in playing the clenched closetothechest 
emotions that go with honeymans starched wellheeled appearance 
he played similar types as ts eliot in the 1984 play tom and 
viv and as brock the stuffy upperclass briton in david hares 
plenty opposite kate nelligan for which both he and nelligan 
received tony nominations 
he played franklin delano roosevelt in two tv movies with jane 
alexander as eleanor 
i didnt go to prep school if anything after playing fdr i 
was afraid i was going to be typed in comedies loony comedies 
said herrmann 
herrmann 45 turned up for an interview at a chelsea pub dressed 
in the natty style his latest role demands the character in the 
play wears a tie and theres a value in keeping in the clothes you 
are going to play in he said 
he took the role solely for the chance of acting opposite the 
great guinness having turned down offers to do it at the yale 
repertory theater in new haven and on broadway last february 
when i heard sir alec wanted to do it it was something i 
wanted to put my hat in the ring for said herrmann the way 
alec does it its just a charmer 
robert prosky and sam waterston performed a walk in the woods 
for four months in new york where it received a tony nomination for 
best play the british production directed by ronald eyre received 
mixed reviews for the writing but nearraves for the stars herrmann 
is contracted for six months plus a british tour if guinness is 
willing 
a new york stage veteran herrmann won a 1976 tony for mrs 
warrens profession at lincoln center he appeared last winter 
with al pacino and martin sheen in julius caesar the second in 
joseph papps series of shakespeare productions at the public 
theater 
all three actors and the production itself were panned 
said herrmann i was crushed id been vain about my ability to 
speak blank verse because i really could and the other guys 
didnt know what it was 
but after the reviews he said i banged my head around for a 
long time 
he has been banging about onscreen as well 
a familiar movie face for over a decade he appeared in a 
little sex annie and reds and more recently in 
overboard the lost boys and the bette midlerlily tomlin 
comedy big business 
the latter movies offered the chance to play three absolutely 
whackedout people especially the role of a vampire in lost 
boys 
people asked arent you afraid of playing a vampire he 
recalled are you kidding id kill to play a vampire it was 
great 
herrmann likes equally working in movies and theater 
acting is acting its just the way you pitch it he said 
in a movie the room is the size of the room on the stage the 
room is the size of the stage its a question i think of 
technique rather than difference in kind you just have to use a 
different set of muscles 
herrmann studied on a fulbright scholarship to the london academy 
of music and dramatic art in 196869 
england has had a big influence on my life i feel very at home 
here he said they listen much better here theyre keyed to 
language 
but that has its dangers theyve seen so much theater they 
may not be aware youre trying something really new they may expect 
a performance to fit a certain pattern

ted turner is living up to his promise to produce 
highquality original programming for his new tnt network 
the prestigious premiere of such programming is a man for all 
seasons making its debut wednesday and starring charlton heston 
vanessa redgrave and sir john gielgud 
the screenplay was written by threetime academy award winner 
robert bolt based on his play bolt won oscars for lawrence of 
arabia dr zhivago and the 1966 film version of a man for 
all seasons he also wrote the screenplays for the films ryans 
daughter and the mission besides best screenplay a man for 
all seasons won academy awards for best picture best actor paul 
scofield and best photography 
it would be reasonable to wonder why would anyone want to remake 
such a success but this interpretation nicely directed by heston 
merits the effort it is faster and wittier closer to the play for 
instance it restores the dramatic stage device of the common man 
roy kinnear a comic character who whispers to the other 
characters and directly addresses the audience 
it was our goal to be the first to film the play as originally 
written said producer fraser c heston the actors son 
the story surrounds the conflict between king henry viii and sir 
thomas more one of the kings most trusted advisers more loses his 
position and eventually his life because he refuses to surrender 
his personal convictions even in the face of public duty 
individual versus social responsibility is the constant 
question posed in a democratic society heston says according to 
tnt publicity because the play makes an unavoidably contemporary 
statement it is truly a play for all seasons when robert bolt sat 
down to write a man for all seasons god must have whispered in 
his ear 
heston like some other older actors has been reduced of late to 
gueststarring on nighttime soap operas and tv movies he obviously 
relishes this juicy role the movie was shot in england at pinewood 
studios and at historical locations including hampton court palace 
henry viiis home 
the movie was filmed in a brief 19 days a feat made possible by 
the fact that heston and most of the cast excepting redgrave and 
gielgud had just completed a soldout run of the play in london 
redgrave is superb as feisty lady alice more an ultimately 
tragic figure who loses everything because of her stubborn husband 
heston and redgrave had worked together on the stage in macbeth 
a decade ago gielgud is in the movie only briefly as cardinal 
wolsey who dies early in the story 
martin chamberlain does his best as henry viii but next to the 
taller charismatic heston he isnt as imposing as he should be 
as the story opens wolsey warns more hell be expected to 
support henry in defiance of the pope in seeking a divorce from 
his wife catherine because she cannot produce a male heir more a 
devout roman catholic decides to avoid a conflict by not commenting 
on the matter but ultimately the king views his silence as 
condemnation 
early in the film henry comes to mores home 
why does your grace need my poor support more asks 
because you are honest the king says and more to the 
point you are known to be honest 
lady alice is concerned that her husband has irreparably angered 
the king 
set your mind at rest thomas tells her this is not the 
stuff of which martyrs are made 
eventually however more carries his convictions to the 
executioner

in their latest and most likely final offer the 
management of rjr nabisco inc offered shareholders 8 billion more 
for their shares than in their first offer 
what is 8 billion 
among other things it is the asset value of a company the size 
of minnesota mining amp manufacturing co including about 180 plants 
and 370 sales offices and distribution centers in 49 countries 
or it is the assets of georgiapacific corp which owns or has 
cutting rights to 56 million acres of north american timberlands 
plus morton thiokol inc the aerospace contractor and a few 
hundred million dollars in change 
had shareholders accepted the first offer which was publicized 
as being in their interest they would have so to speak left that 
much on the table 
it is because of such mindboggling considerations as these that 
aspects of the rjr nabisco sale will be debated well into the next 
century and perhaps as long as business schools exist 
did shareholders get a fair deal it would seem so since the 
stock leaped in a few weeks from 55 a share to more than 90 but 
even after such good fortune some shareholders might not be as 
happy as you might think 
a good many rjr nabisco shareholders were longterm investors 
with an eye on the steady dividends of 5 percent or so a year which 
they had expected to continue well into the future 
these investors were not traders or sellers rjr nabisco was to 
them a source of income suddenly they have capital gains taxes to 
pay which when combined with state taxes could approach 40 percent 
what does the precipitous sale of an established company mean to 
holders of bonds big losses bonds purchased when the companys 
debt position was strong have inevitably lost value as the company 
becomes burdened with debt 
the questions drive at the very meaning of a company 
is a corporation a dynamic everchanging institution whose value 
to its immediate owners or to society at large lies in its 
unique ability to produce products and services 
or is it to be viewed as a static entity like a consumer product 
on a shelf to be sold and in the selling lose all its future value 
as a creator of change a payer of dividends an employer a 
taxpayer a producer 
how is the rjr nabisco management to be viewed or in fact the 
management of any company that promises to serve the shareholders 
creditors employees and customers but which plots to take the 
company for its own portfolio 
the meaning of insider trading a term used commonly to 
describe those outsiders who gain access to inside information and 
use it for their own financial gain might have to be reconsidered 
consider that prior to making their announcements buyout 
managements use privileged information to construct their offer 
they allow investors to buy bonds knowing that those bonds will 
fall in value on their announcement 
is it proper for management to arrange for the continuance of 
their salaries plus benefits bonuses and lucrative pensions should 
they fail in their takeover attempt and instead fall prey to a 
hostile offer 
is an insider takeover and dismantling a proper end for a 
thriving company built on the savings sacrifices and ingenuity of 
entrepreneurs the millions of manhours of labor the years of 
risks the hard times conquered 
in comparison what sacrifices ingenuity labor risks and hard 
times are incurred by a management that benefits from its failure 
ie that puts the company on the block because it thinks it might 
be better dead than alive 
the debate is only beginning

this muggy port city has become the 
base of operations for colombian drug gangs that are turning tiny 
ecuador a nation of just 10 million people into a crossroads for 
the world cocaine trade 
in the last two years the amount of colombian cocaine flowing 
through the andean nation en route to the united states and europe 
has increased dramatically according to ecuadorean narcotics police 
and the us drug enforcement administration dea 
officials also fear colombias drug barons are seeking to use 
ecuador to launder their huge cocaine profits and to invest in 
legitimate enterprises 
the enormous profits from drug trafficking have converted it 
into an octopus whose tentacles are threatening to strangle 
ecuador president leon febres cordero said in may three months 
before his term ended 
john powell head of dea operations in ecuador estimated that 30 
to 50 tons of cocaine will have been smuggled into and out of 
ecuador by the end of this year 
just in the first six months of this year theres been over 5 
tons of cocaine seized in other countries that we know came through 
ecuador powell said in an interview 
the significance of the figures can be seen in us estimates 
that 72 tons of cocaine are consumed annually in the united states 
colombias drug lords have diverted much of their cocaine through 
ecuador after narcotics officials in the united states and europe 
began searching colombian planes and ships more thoroughly say 
police and us drug officers 
ecuador is wedged between peru and colombia on the northwest 
shoulder of south america peru is the worlds largest grower of 
coca leaf the raw material of cocaine colombia is home to the drug 
cartels that control the worlds cocaine trade 
if you put pressure on in one place the traffickers have to go 
somewhere else and ecuador is handy powell said theyve been 
using it for a while anyway to get coca paste from peru to colombia 
for processing 
the seizures of pure cocaine smuggled in containers aboard 
freighters from guayaquil this year include 
5129 pounds discovered in a chocolate shipment at newark nj 
in june it was the largest cocaine seizure ever made by us 
authorities outside florida 
2860 pounds discovered by us federal agents in april in port 
everglades fla it was buried in a shipment of frozen fruit pulp to 
prevent detection by dogs trained to sniff out drugs 
759 pounds found hidden between the wood paneling of 
prefabricated walls shipped in march to barcelona spain it was one 
of the largest seizures of cocaine ever made in europe 
since 1986 us customs officials also have seized five 
ecuatoriana cargo and passenger planes that have landed in miami and 
new york with cocaine hidden aboard the stateowned airline has had 
to pay more than 4 million in fines to gain the release of the 
planes 
ecuador is beginning to feel the breath of the colombian 
mafia said col gustavo gallegos head of interpol in ecuador 
the menace of the mafia also is seen in the attempt to convert 
ecuador into a major moneylaundering country 
because of its bank secrecy laws this is an ideal place to 
launder drug profits powell said 
ecuadorean bankers estimate that 200 million to 400 million in 
cocaine money will have entered ecuador by the end of this year 
either for laundering or for investment in legitimate businesses 
thats a lot of money coming into a small country like ecuador 
it can have a corrupting influence powell said 
newspapers have complained in recent editorials about colombian 
drug money corrupting judges and driving up the price of real estate 
tracking down the source of the money is complicated by the fact 
that investments by apparently legitimate colombian companies have 
also increased sharply in the last few years 
ecuadors largest brewery is among the most recent and prominent 
of the colombian purchases 
some 120000 colombian tourists are expected to visit ecuador 
this year making it hard for ecuadors narcotics police to keep 
track of suspicious visitors 
colombian traffickers enter here easily with false identities 
they buy property open businesses interpols gallegos said in an 
interview in quito the highland capital once they are set up 
with everything in legal order they begin to export cocaine 
authorities are investigating some 20 guayaquil export companies 
bought by colombians in the past year including the firm that 
shipped cocaine in containers of chocalate to the united states 
febres cordero the former president is credited by us 
narcotics officials with destroying nearly all the coca plantations 
that colombian cocaine traffickers tried to set up several years ago 
in remote jungle regions bordering colombia 
powell said us officials are confident ecuadors new president 
rodrigo borja and his police officials will try to outperform 
the febres cordero government in the drug war 
they see narcotics as a threat to the stability of the 
government he said it doesnt take any genius to look next 
door to peru or colombia to see the disastrous effects the cocaine 
trade has had on those countries

east germany once the soviet unions staunchest 
ideological ally has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of 
censorship aimed at bridling the spread of the kremlins new reform 
policies 
the seriousness of the campaign became clear nov 20 when east 
germanys communist government slapped a firstever openended ban 
on a soviet publication a magazine called sputnik 
the campaign has pitted east germanys aging and conservative 
leaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in the 
soviet union whose reexaminations of soviet history have led to a 
public debate on a scale unheard of in east germany 
east german leaders have long resisted president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness and other reforms on 
grounds that such critical discussions of problems in east germany 
are unnecessary 
recent speeches by communist party leaders have reiterated the 
governments rejection of the soviet reforms course 
however the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yet 
by the government to distance itself from the debate in moscow and 
to insulate the nations population from the popular changes 
gorbachevs policies enjoy enormous support among east germans 
who hope his influence will bring about change in one of eastern 
europes most tightly controlled societies 
east german party leaders have occasionally blocked the 
distribution of newspapers from warsaw pact neighbors in the past 
during the 1968 prague spring in czechoslovakia and the early 
periods of labor unrest in poland 
selected issues of soviet magazines have also been blocked but 
until the decision on the monthly magazine sputnik no outright ban 
had ever been imposed on a soviet magazine 
the decision was followed quickly with an order removing five 
soviet films dealing with stalinist themes from theaters across the 
country 
authorities also canceled an east berlin cabaret production that 
poked fun at the governments reluctance to accept gorbachevs 
reform policies 
the banning of sputnik followed its publication of articles 
critical of the late josef stalin and germanys communists before 
adolf hitler took power in germany in 1933 
stalin who died in 1953 holds a special place in official east 
germany as a liberator in world war ii and as the soviet leader who 
helped found the new communist nation in 1949 
east german leaders were outraged over an article in sputniks 
october issue that suggested that stalin had been a mere puppet of 
hitler after the two nations signed a mutual nonaggression pact 
in 1939 and that germanys communists had indirectly aided hitlers 
rise to power by not joining together with social democrats to 
stop him 
the sputnik article also charged that german communists followed 
stalins order to stop all antifascist propaganda after the 
pact was signed 
nazi germany invaded the soviet union in 1941 
distribution of the october sputnik was ordered halted shortly 
after it appeared in east germany 
these historical issues go to the very root of their 
communist east german leaders existence said stefan heym a 
prominent east german author told the associated press in east 
berlin 
these articles upset the picture of the world they want to 
depict 
erich honecker the east german leader along with a substantial 
number of the nations ruling politburo members were members of the 
prewar german communist party and pride themselves on having fought 
fascism 
honecker was imprisoned by the nazis and thousands of communists 
were slain shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at the 
time have not been a matter for debate in the east german media 
in an article defending the sputnik ban the communist party 
organ neues deutschland charged that the publication not only 
distorts soviet history but the history of the german communist 
party 
the magazine and we say this openly defames german 
communists 
while carefully emphazing that sputnik was not an official 
organ of the soviet communist party neues deutchland added that 
distorted visions of soviet history distributed here are 
incompatible with our friendship with the soviet union 
soviet officials defended the magazine saying it mirrors a 
plurality of opinion in the soviet press

ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev who have 
made arms control history together are bound to revisit their idea 
of a dramatic reduction in strategic weapons when they meet over 
lunch this week but a nudge forward rather than a breakthrough is 
the most thats likely to result 
the strategic arms reduction treaty that they have been talking 
about the hopedfor centerpiece in reagans arms control program 
has too many holes in it for gorbachev and reagan to reach command 
decisions during their threehour luncheon wednesday on governors 
island in new york harbor 
moreover gorbachev is well aware that he is dealing with a lame 
duck president who will have six weeks left in office and will be in 
no position to commit his successor george bush to any course of 
action 
for all that max m kampelman the chief us arms control 
negotiator finds it difficult to believe arms will not come up 
during lunch 
i believe it will come up kampelman said in an interview 
last week but i dont believe it will come up in a negotiating 
context my own judgment is it will come up as a discussion and 
maybe a quick review of where things stand now 
kampelman added and i guess perhaps an expression on both 
sides they hope to finish the work i cannot myself envisage any 
detailed discussion of the arms negotiations taking place 
the unfinished treaty will be turned over to presidentelect 
bushs administration with the us side hopes a renewed 
commitment from gorbachev to maintain its current high priority 
reagan intends to raise arms control issues with the soviet 
leader just as he will bring up the suspended red army withdrawal 
from afghanistan and the human rights situation officials say 
but the vital ground work simply has not been undertaken this 
time for example secretary of state george p shultz did not have 
a planning session with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to 
set an agenda and to define the issues for their leaders 
arms negotiations were adjourned in geneva switzerland on nov 
15 and the two sides have not met since 
they ended the 10th round of talks agreeing to an early 
resumption in 1989 the united states subsequently proposed feb 15 
the soviets did not respond 
reagan and bush probably will have shultz and a handful of other 
senior us officials at the luncheon table with them but the us 
and soviet arms control experts who normally labor over the details 
while the leaders hold their summits plan no such sessions 
shultz has predicted a substantive discussion another us 
official mindful of gorbachevs innovative style remarked you 
never can tell 
but the hard fact is that the treaty to reduce us and soviet 
armories of longrange bombers missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 
percent is still mired in disagreement on several key points 
the two sides have not decided for instance whether to include 
mobile missiles or sealaunched cruise missiles both are extremely 
hard to track that means cutbacks are hard to verify the room for 
cheating is uncomfortably wide 
the soviets meanwhile still would like to restrict reagans 
strategic defense initiative as part of a treaty deal the 4 
billionayear program is designed to stop ballistic missiles in 
space but critics here and in moscow say it could extend the arms 
race to a new and dangerous sphere 
then there is the fact a new us administration is coming 
aboard one that may not share the outgoing administrations views 
on reducing strategic weapons 
brent scowcroft designated by bush to be his national security 
adviser is worried that large cutbacks in us strategic weapons 
could make the warsaw pacts edge in conventional forces in europe 
more significant 
he also is concerned that reducing the us arsenal of landbased 
intercontinental ballistic missiles could expose those that remain 
to a higher risk of being destroyed in the event of a soviet attack 
bush will be at the table deferring to reagan it will be 
president reagans meeting he said 
and yet reagan will be aware that in a sense he will be 
speaking also for bush and should not commit his successor to 
positions he may not want to take after jan 20

huge grain surpluses resembling the ones that 
ushered in the rural crisis of the early 1980s could be just around 
the corner despite current droughtreduced supplies warns a leading 
government economist 
the drought has altered the immediate outlook but in a world 
of subsidized agriculture the longterm tendency to overproduction 
lurks only slightly below the surface said ewen m wilson 
undersecretary of agriculture for economics 
because of the summer drought the world witnessed the steepest 
decline in grain stocks ever recorded he acknowledged in remarks to 
the departments annual agricultural outlook conference last week 
the 29 percent plunge in us grain production more than a 
third of the nations corn and over half of the spring wheat crop 
turned markets upside down banished were surpluses and bargain 
basement prices tight supplies and steep prices became the rule 
according to wilson however the change has sent pessimists 
scurrying to the works of thomas malthus the 18th century 
philospher who predicted almost 200 years ago that global population 
would outrun the planets food supply 
todays malthusians say that we have reached a plateau in 
agricultural productivity that the easy gains in crop yields have 
been won and that future gains will be diminished he said 
furthermore they say that environmental degradation will further 
constrain productivity and that the advances of biotechnology are 
years away 
in fact said wilson farm productivity has increased 30 percent 
in the last decade alone at that rate farmers and the government 
will be wrestling with surpluses of 14 billion bushels of corn 320 
million bushels of wheat and 200 million bushels of soybeans even 
if no land idled under the 1985 farm law is returned to production 
there is little reason to believe that the pace of 
technological improvement in agriculture will slow in the years 
ahead wilson said if anything dramatic breakthroughs are on 
the horizon within the next few years biotechnology will move from 
the laboratory into commercial use potentially offering new plant 
varieties resistant to insects heat drought frost and disease 
the bottom line is that underlying fundamentals may have been 
masked but they have not been changed by the 1988 drought he said 
american agriculture has long been plagued by a chronic excess 
capacity wilson said he cited a study by usdas economic research 
service which showed 9 percent excess capacity for all of the 
nations agriculture in the 1980s and more than 20 percent for major 
program crops such as corn and wheat 
the fact is agricultural productivity continues to outpace the 
growth in demand for agricultural products he said the danger 
today is that policymakers will be misled by the present tightness 
in global grain supplies brought about by the drought 
analysts have always been swayed by conditions prevailing at 
the time they make their estimates and they have frequently 
underestimated the capacity of farmers to expand production he 
said but history has demonstrated time and time again that when 
prices give the signal to expand output farmers invariably 
respond 
for a number of reasons the rebuilding of stocks this time may 
be gradual rather than sudden wilson said he cited an eventual 
removal of 40 million acres from production by the conservation 
reserve program the lower dollar sends us commodities overseas at 
a brisker pace growing economies overseas especially in the 
pacific rim countries represent expanding markets for american farm 
goods 
despite these caveats i believe it would be a great mistake to 
ignore longterm fundamentals wilson said barring another 
drought the odds are in favor of a rebound in production and a 
rebuilding of stocks 
even if this rebuilding is gradual it underlines the 
importance of the reforms that have been proposed by the united 
states for agriculture in the uruguay round of general agreement on 
tariffs and trade negotiations he added 
in the talks the united states has proposed a gradual phaseout 
of agricultural subsidies a proposal that has thus far failed to 
arouse much enthusiasm in europe 
in the absence of such reform said wilson it will be 
difficult to avoid a return to the costly and wasteful agricultural 
surpluses that have plagued us in the past

maybe it will be called the lunchtime summit 
maybe it will be called the ultimate power lunch maybe it will just 
be called a meeting 
ever since the white house announced that president reagan 
presidentelect george bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
would break bread in new york on dec 7 people have been talking 
about what to call the gettogether 
it often has been the case that officials have been relucant to 
label such a meeting a summit beforehand saying this would raise 
expectations that would not then be fulfilled 
on the other hand skeptics note that meetings that have been 
billed as nonsummits have turned into fullfledged international 
confrontations fraught with consequence 
websters new world dictionary defines summit as follows in 
connection with diplomatic negotiations the level restricted to 
heads of government 
that would make the new york lunch a summit if there was any 
negotiating but the white house insists there wont be officials 
say there are no plans for the working groups and expanded teams for 
plenary sessions that customarily accompany world leaders to a 
summit 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater tried to make the point 
four times in a 34minute briefing on nov l4 that the new york 
session would not be the kind of highpowered conclave that winston 
churchill christened a parley at the summit 
this would not be a summit meeting in any traditional sense 
fitzwater said 
its not a summit he said 
a summit would by definition i think have to be more 
prepared he said 
this is just a very cordial meeting to say hello and goodbye 
if you will he said 
as if all this werent enough reagan himself chimed in within 
the hour saying that isnt anything in the nature of a summit 
meeting and i can only tell you it is not going to be a 
summit 
two weeks later secretary of state george p shultz described 
the session as a meeting at the summit fitzwater however 
noted that the meeting was expected to last less than three hours 
and added i think it is pretty hard to characterize that as a 
summit at least in any traditional sense 
despite the white house assurances it was hard to forget that 
both the us and soviet sides claimed beforehand that the 
reagangorbachev meeting in reykjavik iceland in october 1986 was 
not a summit 
but the meeting took up sweeping nuclear arms control proposals 
ended in a wrangle over reagans star wars system of spacebased 
missile defense and has been called a summit ever since

president reagan and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev are meeting wednesday for the fifth time at a luncheon in 
new york 
they will be joined at the table by presidentelect george bush 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the session will 
ensure that the momentum and continuity of the arms control talks 
are extended and it will reaffirm the relations between the general 
secretary and the new president of the united states as we enter the 
decade of the 90s 
officials said subjects would include the suspended soviet troop 
withdrawal from afghanistan with the united states seeking 
assurances that the troops will be out on schedule they said the 
agenda for arms control and human rights talks would also be raised 
here in brief is a look at the previous reagangorbachev 
summits

the two leaders met on nov 19 and 21 exchanging enthusiastic 
handshakes and champagne toasts before getting down to business 
when the meeting was over they had agreed to hold summits in 
1986 in washington and 1987 in moscow and to give impetus to arms 
control talks aiming at 50 percent reductions in nuclear weapons 
reagan said in advance of the meeting that he would press 
gorbachev on human rights and regional conflicts but documents 
after the summit and statements by the leaders indicated little sign 
of movement 
agreements were reached on cultural exchanges air safety 
additional consulates increased air travel and cooperation on 
energy 
both sides said they favored a complete prohibition of chemical 
weapons as well as destruction of existing stockpiles a goal that 
still has not been reached although an international conference is 
forthcoming 
the two sides failed to reach any agreement on reagans star wars 
plan of spacebased missile defense on extension of the salt ii 
treaty on divided families or on a joint venture in space

moscow broke off presummit talks after the us bombing of libya 
in april 1986 dooming any chance of a summit in washington that 
year but the soviets and the white house announced sept 30 that 
reagan and gorbachev would meet oct 11 and 12 in the icelandic 
capital 
reagan told reporters this is not a summit saying it was 
designed only to pave the way for summit meetings in washington and 
moscow spokesman larry speakes said we will be satisfied with 
the iceland meetings if we accomplish better understanding 
the meetings ended in misunderstanding with us officials 
proclaiming themselves deeply disappointed because potential 
arms agreements vanished when the two leaders reached an impasse on 
testing of star wars weaponry the administration later sought to 
paint the outcome in brighter hues with reagan saying it left the 
superpowers closer than ever to an unprecedented cut in nuclear 
arsenals 
four months after the summit the democraticcontrolled house 
armed services committee said in a report that there remained an 
astonishing degrees of confusion surrounding what actually 
happened at reykjavik the report said sweeping us proposals for 
deep reductions in nuclear arms were presented without advance study 
by the pentagon 
disagreement remains over the events of reykjavik on nov 15 
the day plans were announced for the latest reaganbushgorbachev 
meeting the president was asked how the united states would react 
if gorbachev brought proposals as he did in iceland said reagan 
well it depends on whether youre going by the public version of 
reykjavik or what actually happened there he did not elaborate

in meetings dec 810 at the white house the two leaders signed 
an agreement to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear missiles the 
first treaty ever to eliminate an entire category of nuclear arms 
they said they made progress but reached no agreement to curb 
longrange strategic weapons and struck no deal on soviet withdrawal 
from afghanistan still a trouble spot in 1988 despite a 
unmediated agreement by the soviets to withdraw all troops by 
feb 15

reagan arrived in the soviet capital may 29 for a fourday stay 
that would be long on pageantry and symbolism but offer a mixed 
record of accomplishment 
a joint communique said the leaders reached common ground on 
verifying the numbers of mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried 
by airplanes important elements if a strategic arms treaty is to be 
reached 
but the sides were still divided on the us star wars program as 
well as on submarinefired missiles and reductions in conventional 
forces 
on human rights gorbachev said he told reagan that your 
explanations are not convincing i am not filled with admiration 
at this aspect of the visit reagan has applauded recent human

children stop chattering 
when the israeli soldiers come in their trucks and riot helmets 
young men grip stones and the faces of their elders grow grim 
a year ago in this ramshackle refugee camp of tin shacks and 
crude concreteblock houses palestinians began their first 
sustained rebellion in 21 years of israeli occupation no end is in 
sight 
more than 300 palestinians and 11 israelis have been killed more 
than 7000 palestinians have been wounded of 20000 arrested 
nearly 6000 remain in jail 
the intefadeh the arabic word for uprising used even by the 
israelis has generated international sympathy and a new sense of 
purpose and identity among the 15 million palestinians of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
although the palestine liberation organization did not start the 
rebellion it has become deeply involved and a young underground 
leadership has been formed to direct the protest 
an israeli election was fought largely on policy in the occupied 
lands and the related question of how to achieve peace with the 
arabs the palestinians declared an independent state changing the 
situation irreversibly 
on this day schoolgirls were walking home when two trucks filled 
with soldiers rumbled by in the muddy street the grins on the 
girls faces disappeared and they fell silent their faces blank 
a 33yearold man standing nearby who said he had five children 
was asked about the future for the 50000 people of jabaliya 
the blood will keep flowing he said 
hardly a day goes by in the camp without a teenager being 
wounded by soldiers who open fire on stonethrowing youngsters on 
the west bank it is much the same 
the revolt has spread to the arab sector of jerusalem and in 
small ways to arabs who live inside israel and are citizens of the 
jewish state 
for many palestinians the revolt is a source of both pride and 
dismay the passivity of the occupation has ended but thousands of 
families have a son killed or wounded or someone imprisoned 
israelis view the rebellion with fear or hatred the cars of 
jewish settlers in the occupied lands are stoned as they travel to 
their homes some respond with gunfire 
jews are afraid to go to the arab sector of jerusalem which the 
government has annexed as part of israels capital 
parliamentary elections nov 1 made clear that israelis are 
deeply divided on how to deal with the palestinians parties winning 
seats in the 120member knesset advocated every solution from 
trading occupied land for peace to expelling all palestinians from 
the west bank and gaza 
dedi zucker a member of parliament for the leftwing citizens 
rights movement sees an odd unity in this and said of the two 
extremes in both cases people dont believe israelis and 
palestinians can live together in the current situation 
dozens of times in the past year israeli officials have 
interpreted a lull in the violence as evidence that the rebellion 
was waning but each time the lull has passed 
ephraim sneh former head of the west bank military government 
wrote in the newspaper haaretz that despite the toll taken on 
palestinian society it would be a mistake to assume it is 
incapable of sustaining the intefadeh 
for most palestinians the question is not whether to continue 
but with what tactics 
daoud kuttab a leading palestinian journalist sees the revolt 
at a crossroads pulled one way by those weary of trouble and 
frequent general strikes and the other by those who believe only 
violence will drive israel from the occupied lands 
kuttab says the problem is to keep the revolt in the worlds eye 
without making israel angry enough to crush it by any means 
necessary 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza see the great achievements 
of the intefadeh as building their own pride and drawing attention 
to their plight not only in the west but among their own leaders in 
plo 
they believe television pictures of israeli soldiers shooting or 
beating young palestinians have had a lasting effect 
as for the plo for years it declared with overblown rhetoric 
that the jews would be driven into the sea last month it issued a 
palestinian declaration of independence based on a un resolution 
that calls for creating jewish and arab states side by side 
hatem abu ghazali a community leader in the west bank city of 
nablus sees this as a major accomplishment for palestinians who 
live with the reality of israeli occupation rather than with dreams 
of the past 
we have shown international public opinion that we are looking 
for peace not only the people but the leadership of the plo he 
said adding that the response from israel and the united states 
will increase palestinian anger and frustration 
israel called the plo declarations doubletalk intended to 
mask an aim of destroying israel in stages 
secretary of state george p shultz refused plo chairman yasser 
arafat a visa to address the united nations in new york and four 
days later two firebombs were hurled into the compound of the us 
consulate in arab east jerusalem they caused no damage 
abu ghazali said the us and israeli responses provided a 
hearty ideological meal to those who want violence but journalist 
kuttab contended that more violence is not inevitable 
he said the uprisings future will be decided by debate among 
palestinians and throughout the world in the west bank and gaza 
however anger often outpaces hopeful thinking 
the intefadeh began when an israeli army truck collided with two 
arab vans just outside jabaliya on dec 8 1987 killing four 
palestinians and injuring six 
rumors spread that it was not an accident but revenge for the 
slaying of an israeli businessman three days earlier crowds 
gathered that night and by the next day hundreds of youths were 
throwing stones at israeli soldiers 
then as now the soldiers opened fire the first to die was 
mohammed hatem abu sisi a 17yearold high school student 
the other day in ramallah a west bank city just north of 
jerusalem a 15yearold named mohammed spoke of what lies ahead for 
the rebellion 
with his light brown hair jeans and sneakers he could have 
passed for an american teenager but what he said was either we 
will get our state or well fight some people are prepared even to 
kill jews

first lt sheffy said he was 
torn apart emotionally after wounding a 12yearold palestinian boy 
with a plastic bullet 
for two days i couldnt face myself the tall darkhaired 
company commander recalled sheffy 23 said he and his companion on 
a twoman patrol fired on hundreds of stonethrowing palestinians 
who ambushed them wounding several 
he estimated he had fired plastic bullets more than 100 times in 
three months of almost daily street battles a rifle with a sniper 
scope was on the table in front of him 
sheffy says he has tried to block out his emotions so he can do 
the job and now its easier i just dont ask myself too many 
questions 
i dont see myself as a hero for shooting someone he said 
but i think it is necessary to keep the situation from getting 
even more violent 
second lt doron a platoon leader said constant stress and 
facetoface conflict with palestinians make the soldiers 
shorttempered and prone to quarrel 
i feel there is a tendency towards more violence said doron 
who is 22 and comes from a kibbutz or communal farm its 
difficult to act one way here and differently at home 
sheffy and doron are first names army regulations prohibit the 
use of last names of soldiers serving in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
some israelis fear soldiers returning from duty in the 
territories will release their pentup anger on civilians both 
arabs and jews 
israel is especially vulnerable to such side effects of conflict 
because virtually all men and women are required to serve in the 
military men do up to 62 days a year of reserve duty until age 49 
reuven gal former chief army psychologist who now heads the 
private israeli institute for miliary studies said research 
indicates one effect of israels wars has been an increase in crime 
he said that also could be a result of the yearlong palestinian 
uprising 
i would not be surprised to see a sharp increase in crimes such 
as beating and assault along with an increase in traffic 
accidents he said 
gals wife ivria an author wrote a poem about how service 
during the uprising changed her 20yearold son yoav from an 
antiwar activist to a toughminded soldier 
the pictures of my son the soldier who attended peace now 
rallies with long hair and an earring are on the front page of the 
newspaper and he is described as a brute occupier she wrote 
my heart is torn because i know the soul behind that picture i 
know the confusion and i know the pain 
when her son came home for the weekend the poem says she washed 
the dirt from his clothes and treated his swollen feet his blisters 
and cuts but i cry and my heart goes to him because who is going 
to treat my sons internal wounds who is going to see the unseen 
wound 
sheffy and two of his platoon leaders spoke to a journalist in a 
tent near the mazelike public market of nablus a focal point for 
antiisraeli violence since the uprising began dec 8 1987 
they said the army faced protests by thousands of palestinians 
early in the intefadeh the arabic word for uprising that has been 
adopted even by israelis 
today most confrontations are on a small scale a foot patrol 
or army vehicle ambushed by half a dozen young arabs who hurl stones 
or bottles of flaming gasoline and dart into an alley 
two soldiers from sheffys elite infantry unit suffered severe 
head injuries and one was partially paralyzed by large blocks of 
stone dropped from rooftops 
saguy a 22yearold a second lieutenant said men in his platoon 
often wanted to get even i talk to them i tell them that revenge 
is indiscriminate that it will hurt people that have harmed no 
one he said 
such frustration has led to several instances of attacks by 
soldiers on innocent bystanders 
army radio said 45 soldiers and officers had been tried and 15 
were convicted receiving jail sentences that ranged up to a year 
for a manslaughter case 
in november for example the army gave 21 paratroopers up to two 
weeks in jail each for going on a rampage after their bus was stoned 
in a refugee camp the officercadets broke windows in 20 houses and 
damaged four cars 
critics say one of the main problems is that occupation duty 
normally is handled by specialized police forces not young soldiers 
whose training is for fighting wars 
there should be a permanent force that doesnt change every 
three or four weeks said aryeh shalev former head of the west 
bank military government we should free the army from this 
function its not a military job its a police job 
the uprising caught the army unprepared soldiers did not wear 
helmets did not have truncheons and were not trained in crowd 
control or the use of tear gas the result was high casualties from 
live fire which has accounted for 3500 woundings and most of the 
more than 300 palestinian fatalities 
soldiers interviewed in nablus said they are better prepared for 
riots now because of new technology and a 10day training course 
they said the plastic bullet introduced in september as a 
nonlethal alternative to live ammunition has made them more feared 
in the street and eased their own frustration 
the arabs used to bare their chests and yell shoot me 
shoot me knowing that we had orders not to shoot unless our lives 
were in danger saguy said now we dont need to do more than 
aim and they disperse

camp

winstonsalem nc ap dreams of big stock profits and the 
possible return of rjr nabisco incs corporate headquarters are 
being tempered by the specter of layoffs in this tobacco community 
following the companys record buyout agreement 
i think the general feeling is one of uncertainty said fred 
nordenholz president of the winstonsalem chamber of commerce 
there are lots of mixed feelings about whats happening 
rjr nabiscos 2453 billion buyout agreement with kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co means potentially big windfalls for the rj 
reynolds tobacco co workers and others among the 9000 area 
residents and groups that own an estimated 2 billion in rjr nabisco 
stock 
some local businessmen also see the possibility that rjr will 
move its corporate headquarters which left winstonsalem for 
atlanta less than two years ago back home again bringing jobs and 
prestige 
but at the same time the company is being bought with 
unprecedented amounts of borrowed money and locals expect 
subsequent belttightening in a number of rjr operations including 
the tobacco business that could include layoffs or other cutbacks 
affecting them 
some people are going to have greater personal wealth than ever 
before and thats balanced by a certain amount of anxiety about 
where the companys headed and whats going to happen to their 
careers nordenholz said 
john davis chairman of the chamber of commerce said stories of 
productionline workers becoming millionaires as stock prices nearly 
doubled in the past 50 days are a bit overstated 
there are some people who are suddenly quartermillionaires on 
paper anyway he said 
but not many are packing up their bags for the bahamas many 
local shareholders will see their gains as a sudden windfall but 
others are looking to reinvest their profits said davis a managing 
partner of the investment firm alex brown and sons 
wade spache a maintenance technician at reynolds tobacco quoted 
by the winstonsalem journal said he had sold some stock earlier at 
84 a share far below the expected 109 value of the buyout but way 
above the 56 range the stock held before the bidding war began oct 
20 
i just wanted to be on the safe side he said i didnt 
want everything i had in speculation 
much of the impact on the community has been psychological 
while many analysts have portrayed rj reynolds tobacco the 
nations no 2 cigarette maker as the corporations moneymaking 
machine few expect the winstonsalembased company to go unscathed 
but rick weddle director of winstonsalem business inc said 
the impact of the buyout even with layoffs would be positive in 
his firms attempts to lure other industry to the area 
i am probably one of the few people alive who sees opportunity 
in employment reductions he said we have a fairly tight labor 
market for certain types of industrial skills 
with local unemployment in the 3 percent range recently it has 
been difficult to benefit from expansion in the export and 
manufacturing sectors weddle said 
for us to share in that we must have all the available 
ingredients he said 
when the financial smoke has cleared winstonsalem could be in 
better shape than it was a year ago davis said 
tobacco is fairly recession resistant as is most of the food 
business he said things may be tight for a year 18 months 
but profits have been in the 20 to 25 percent range what are you 
going to do lay people off because youre making more money it 
doesnt work that way 
some employees could have lingering bitterness against f ross 
johnson rjrs chief executive davis said it was johnson who moved 
rjr corporate headquarters to atlanta and who kicked off the buyout 
war with his own offer to buy the company 
if ross johnson hadnt moved headquarters to atlanta hed have 
had everybody rooting for management davis said

a postthanksgiving pickup in sales by the nations biggest 
general retailers is a positive sign for the important christmas 
shopping season industry watchers say even though sales for all of 
november were sluggish 
sales tallied after the november reporting period which ended 
nov 26 for most retailers showed modest improvement leading us 
to the general conclusion that christmas sales will be reasonably 
healthy said jeffrey feiner a retail industry analyst with 
merrill lynch amp co 
based on the endofthemonth results one could project were 
going to have a moderately strong christmas season said walter 
loeb an analyst with morgan stanley amp co inc 
retailers earn about half their annual profits during the crucial 
holiday period but even if sales are slow profits should improve 
in the fourth quarter because retailers are keeping their 
inventories tight ronning said 
many analysts predict retailers will have a 6 percent overall 
increase in christmas sales from last year but joseph ronning an 
analyst with brown brothers harriman inc warned that the sales 
improvement might look better than it really is because results last 
christmas were disappointing 
novembers sales were on the sluggish side very similar to the 
trends we saw in september and october said jeffrey edelman an 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc the first 3 weeks were 
quite soft 
retailers have had slumping sales for nearly two years as 
consumers have paid more for necessities and services and tried to 
reduce their high debt loads analysts and economists expect this 
trend to continue into 1989 
apparel retailers who have had a yearlong sales slide 
continued their comeback last month for example limited inc a 
leading specialty apparel retailer reported its overall november 
sales rose 25 percent while sales at stores open at least a year 
known as samestore sales picked up 18 percent 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck and co said its 
overall sales were up 88 percent last month and 62 percent for the 
first 43 weeks of the fiscal year sears samestore sales rose 44 
percent in november and 23 percent for the year so far 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate measure of a companys performance than figures that 
include sales from new stores not all retailers report samestore 
sales 
k mart corp said its overall sales were up 55 percent last 
month and 56 percent for the year to date k mart reported its 
samestore sales rose 14 percent for the month and 19 percent so 
far this year 
k marts reporting period ended nov 23 so its sales report did 
not reflect the beginning of the traditional christmas season on the 
day after thanksgiving 
walmart stores inc said its overall sales rose 30 percent 
during november and 29 percent so far in 1988 the discount 
retailers samestore sales were up 13 percent for the month and 11 
percent for the year to date 
jc penney co inc said its overall sales fell 18 percent 
during the month and were up just 01 percent over the cumulative 
43week period penneys samestore sales were off 38 percent 
during november and slipped 11 percent for the year to date 
karen sack an analyst with standard amp poors corp said the 
decline in penneys sales reflected the fact that the company had 
discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year penney 
said it would have recorded a gain if sales from discontinued items 
were excluded from yearearlier results 
dayton hudson corp reported its overall sales picked up 7 
percent during november and 148 percent over the 43week period 
the company reported samestore increases of 15 percent for the 
month and 17 percent for 43 weeks 
may department stores co said its overall sales rose 197 
percent last month and 16 percent for the year to date samestore 
sales rose 28 percent in november and 19 percent for the year so 
far 
fw woolworth co said its overall sales picked up 93 percent 
last month and 118 percent during the 43week period samestore 
sales rose 48 percent in november and 58 percent for the year to 
date 
montgomery ward amp co said its sales were up 78 percent in 
november and 37 percent for the 43 weeks 
sales for several of the big retailers continued to run well 
under the rate of inflation which has increased by 46 percent so 
far this year 
the results reported were from the biggest general merchandise 
and apparel retailers unlike monthly retail sales figures released 
by the federal government they do not include sales at auto 
dealers supermarkets or restaurants

less than two years after its muchheralded move 
to atlanta the corporate headquarters of rjr nabisco inc may be 
moving again leaving little mark on the citys business history 
rjr nabiscos board of directors shocked their hometown 
winstonsalem nc in january 1987 by announcing the move of 
corporate headquarters to metropolitan atlanta 
wednesday the foodandtobacco giants board officially picked 
corporate takeover kings kohlberg kravis roberts amp co as the 
companys new owner and kohlberg kravis has said it would like to 
move rjr nabiscos headquarters back to winstonsalem 
such a move would not have the impact on atlanta that losing one 
of its other corporate giants such as delta air lines or cocacola 
would have 
rjr nabisco only brought some 300 headquarters employees to 
rented luxury office space in cobb county just north of the city 
most rjr nabisco workers in the atlanta area arent even at the 
headquarters among them are 750 at nabiscos plant in atlantas 
oakland city community there has been no indication that nabiscos 
manufacturing operations in the area would be affected immediately 
by the kohlberg kravis takeover 
thus atlanta leaders took the idea of an rjr headquarters 
pullout in stride 
we certainly have appreciated having rjrs corporate 
headquarters in the atlanta area atlanta mayor andrew young said 
thursday in a statement released by his office should they decide 
to relocate i remain confident that the highemployment facilities 
in the atlanta area will remain 
in its nearly two years here rjr nabisco has not become an 
integral part of life in the city for most atlantans outside the 
bigbusiness community the company has no landmark presence no 
giant tower on the city skyline 
its been a corporate presence said barry king vice 
president for communications for the atlanta chamber of commerce 
in the fortune 500theyre very high and thats been important 
for atlanta to be perceived as a major headquarters city 
but we still have the nabisco presence here andin economic 
impact it would be minimal theres only 300 employees in the 
headquarters thats potentially moving 
rjr nabisco picked atlanta as its new home primarily because of 
the business climate and the proximity to hartsfield atlanta 
international airport one of the worlds largest airports 
king said those factors still might prompt rjr nabisco to stay 
it remains to be seen what the final decision would be he 
said we think atlanta has still got the same qualities that 
attracted rjr to this city in the first place 
rjr nabiscos spokeswoman in atlanta polly howes said it was 
too early for headquarters staffers to talk about where they might 
be headed

some analysts say pepsico incs planned 
acquisition of general cinema corps soft drink bottling operation 
will help increase efficiency in the business putting downward 
pressure on soda prices 
pepsico and general cinema announced the proposed 15 billion 
deal on thursday 
analysts said the deal would bring general cinema top dollar for 
the bottling operation relieving some of the earnings and cash flow 
pressure the company has felt from a decline in its movie revenues 
and heavy investment in retailing confectionary and tobacco 
companies 
the move brings one of the nations biggest independent bottlers 
under pepsis control allowing the soft drink giant to consolidate 
bottling operations and reduce costs industry analysts said 
there are too many bottlers operating at inefficient levels if 
pepsi can bring the production costs down the competition in the 
industry will drive the retail price down said roy d burry a 
senior vice president at the wall street brokerage house of kidder 
peabody inc 
the company headquartered in the boston suburb of chestnut hill 
owns and operates 1359 movie screens at 318 locations throughout 
the united states earnings from the movie operations declined about 
5 percent despite a slight rise in box office revenues in the fiscal 
year ended oct 31 nardone said 
general cinema owns about 60 percent of the neiman marcus group 
which consists of neiman marcus bergdorf goodman and contempo 
casuals stores it has announced plans to open 10 to 12 new neiman 
marcus stores by 1995 
general cinema also has bought about 18 percent of the stock in 
cadburyschweppes plc since 1986 said company spokesman philip 
nardone 
general cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 by acquiring 
american beverage corp which held pepsi franchises in miami and 
northern ohio it subsequently purchased other franchises and now 
has regional bottling facilities in atlanta jacksonville fla 
winstonsalem nc twinsburg ohio and charleston wva 
general cinema beverages had preliminary revenue of about 720 
million for the fiscal year ended oct 31 and expects operating 
earnings of about 93 million the company said 
for the quarter ended june 30 the company reported net earnings 
of about 36 million on revenue of about 631 million more than 
double the profit from the year before 
pepsico headquartered in purchase ny had earnings of 595 
million on revenue of 115 billion in 1987 it projects revenue of 
about 13 billion this year 
analysts said they expect the general cinema purchase to dilute 
pepsicos earnings by about 15 cents a share in 1989 
the companies said the transaction is subject to the signing of a 
definitive agreement clearance of antitrust laws and closing prior 
to the end of 1988

two trade groups are calling for sharply 
different solutions to the savings and loan crisis with one 
advocating abolishing sampls as a separate industry and the other 
making preservation of the current system a priority 
the national council of savings institutions the smaller of the 
two lobbying groups wants to abolish the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which backs individual deposits of up to 100000 
in sampls 
a proposal expected to be adopted by the councils board of 
directors on monday says healthy sampls should be permitted to 
transfer to the federal deposit insurance corp which guarantees 
deposits in commercial banks 
sampls that cant qualify for transfer would have five years to 
become healthy or shut down in the end only one federal insurance 
fund would remain regulating both commerical banks and savings 
institutions there would no longer be institutions devoted 
exclusively to financing home mortgages 
thats the opposite of recommendations released thursday by the 
largest trade group the us league of savings institutions the 
league wants to preserve the separate regulatory system for sampls and 
housing finance 
the varied approaches are explained in part by differences 
between their memberships about twothirds of the councils members 
are called savings banks and are already insured by the fdic most 
of the rest have a good chance of qualifying for transfer however 
many of the leagues members are not healthy enough to join the fdic 
both groups agree that the industry cant pay the 50 billion to 
100 billion cost of cleaning up insolvent sampls and that congress 
and the administration must find a way to pay 
the council said congress must use tax money but argued for 
keeping sampl rescue spending exempt from grammrudman budget deficit 
requirements the league said it will offer its funding proposal 
early next year 
while the league is emphasizing the need to maintain a separate 
lending system for housing it also advised against a significant 
rollback of rules permitting sampls in some states to invest in risky 
ventures far removed from home mortage lending 
instead it advocates controlling abuses by requiring sampl owners 
to put up more of their own money or capital when entering risky 
ventures 
when people have their own capital at risk they tend to act 
more responsibly said gerald j levy president of guaranty 
savings amp loan association in milwaukee who chaired the league task 
force on the issue 
many analysts blame the industrys current problems in large part 
on institutions that strayed into speculative areas such as lending 
to commercial real estate projects particularly in states with 
permissive laws such as texas california and florida 
the league said statechartered sampls that used new investment 
powers wisely should not be penalized for the sins of those who 
have abused them 
but rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee and frequent critic of sampls warned the days are over 
when the federal government will provide insurance and then permit a 
state regulator to allow those insured deposits to be put into 
anything under the sun 
overall the us league will get some sympathy in congress when 
they say we shouldnt tax the healthy thrifts into oblivion 
schumer said but theyre going to face far less sympathy when 
they resist the reform measures that are going to have to accompany 
taxpayer dollars 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 
3000 federally insured sampls proposed a riskbased capital 
regulation on monday that would be phased in by 1993 
while not addressing that specific proposal the league said 
provisions should be made where applicable for grandfathering 
meaning that some institutions should be exempted from meeting the 
new requirements 
the league did advocate curbing the growth of insolvent 
institutions a measure already adopted by the bank board it 
recommended tightening rules governing creation of new institutions 
and takeover of existing sampls 
it also wants better standards for appraising the property that 
secures loans it said sampls should be required to independently 
evaluate loans or parts of loans they purchase from other 
institutions

to be cut from farm programs in 1989 to meet targets under the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law 
farm programs of the governments commodity credit corp 
currently cost about 13 billion a year down from peak of 26 
billion in fiscal 1986 
the panelists suggested that congress might pass an extension of 
the farm law and postpone at least until 1991 any real overhaul of 
the current fiveyear programs expiring in 1990 
lyng again said he will be leaving at the start of the new 
administration numerous possible successors have been mentioned 
but thus far no word has come from presidentelect bush or his 
transition team 
farm programs approved in 1985 under the pressure of a 
largescale rural crisis have proven highly popular lyng said 
i dont think we would have any changes in farm programs if it 
werent for budget pressures he said but youve got 3 billion 
to save in some shape or form and its going to drive changes i 
think in 1989 
even so there is no reason to think the bush administration will 
propose sweeping changes right away said lynn daft an agricultural 
economist and former usda official 
you dont have to come forward with legislation right away 
he said he noted that farmers are not clamoring for any change i 
dont see any tractors across the street on the mall he said 
if i were a new administration coming in id say why rush 
he said 
that only provides another reason for stopgap legislation the 
panelists said 
particularly when youve got eight members of the senate 
agriculture committee up for reelection in 1990 said william 
lesher a consultant and former lyng business partner also appearing 
on the panel 
my guess as the secretary says is that its at least a 50 
percent chance that stopgap legislation will be approved he said 
lesher told the panel there are only three ways to reduce farm 
program spending by 3 billion 
he said one would be to lower target prices congressionally set 
price levels used in calculating incomesupport payments another 
would be to reduce the acreage base used in calculating payments he 
said and a third would be to cut the amount of acreage planted

the agriculture department has unveiled a 1989 
program for rice farmers with a national average pricesupport level 
of 650 for each 100 pounds 
the support level represents an expected reduction from a 
national average of 663 in 1988 
price support loans are paid by the governments commodity credit 
corp to farmers who post their crops as collateral because 
producers are free to forfeit the crops and keep the cash the 
system puts a floor under prices 
among program requirements that farmers must meet to qualify for 
federal subsidies secretary of agriculture richard e lyng 
announced a required acreage reduction of 25 percent this 
represents land that farmers cannot plant and is designed to prevent 
surpluses 
lyng set the established target price at 1080 for each 100 
pounds down from 1115 this year 
target prices are used in calculating socalled deficiency 
payments that the government provides as income supports to 
participants in some programs 
other provisions of the rice program 
whole kernel milled rice price support rates were set at 1081 
per hundredweight for long grain and 981 for medium and short 
grain rice the broken kernel rate for all rice classes is 541 
producers who pledged 1989 crop rice as collateral for price 
support loans will not be permitted to purchase marketing 
certificates when repaying loans at the marketing loan repayment 
rate 
the discretionary inventory reduction program will not be 
implemented 
farmers may sign up for the program between dec 19 and april 14

states and japan the eecs main trading partners that their 
efforts to boost trade within the european economic community will 
not be at the expense of imports 
a draft statement to that effect says that a single eec market 
will benefit also non community countries 1992 europe will not 
close in on itselfwill not be a fortress europe but a partnership 
europe 
about 12 hours before the summit began four bombs exploded in 
athens about 200 miles away police said no one was injured in the 
blasts that caused minor damage to buildings including an eec 
office the revolutionary popular struggle said it set off the 
bombs the leftwing group has claimed responsibility for bomb 
attacks in the past

their meeting with a luncheon hosted by greek premier andreas 
papandreou the summits host 
on friday morning the leaders held bilateral meetings britsh

british media magnate robert maxwell on 
friday launched a 12page test issue of the european his daily 
newspaper 
maxwell promised the newspaper would promote european unity and 
would in particular take aim at the oldfashioned nationalistic 
views of british prime minister margaret thatcher 
maxwell said the newspaper would begin daily sales on may 9 
1989 with the eventual goal of achieving circulation of at least 
500000 copies a day and probably between 600000 and 650000 copies 
speaking at a press conference held to coincide with the summit 
of european economic community leaders on the greek island of 
rhodes maxwell said that his initial investment in the project 
would total between 20 million and 30 million pounds the equivalent 
of 37 million to 555 million with an additional 10 million 
pounds or 185 million for promoting the launch of the newspaper 
maxwell added that he was committing himself to investing in the 
newspaper for three to five years 
maxwell said that the european would sell at newstands for 40 
british pence 80 cents and on the continent for the equivalent of 
5 french francs 
maxwell said that the newspapers editorial position would 
champion european unity and actively oppose anyone who slows down 
progress toward such unity 
we will support anything and anybody in favor of european 
unity he said taking particular aim at thatcher 
maxwell criticized the british premier for opposing greater 
european unity in several areas and singled out her opposition to 
british entry into the european monetary system as an idiotic 
position for which he claimed the uk is paying a devastating 
price in terms of high interest and exchange rates 
she will fail in making britain again miss the european bus 
maxwell said 
maxwell said he also was in favor in principle of entry by other 
countries into the eec a more powerful european parliament and the 
reunification of germany 
maxwell said he foresees a staff of 200 to 250 journalists at 
the european with editorial centers in london paris brussels 
and munich the paper will be published in every country in which 
circulation exceeds 30000 copies 
maxwell said that in recent conversations with the eec he had 
informed european commission officials that he opposed investors 
such as myself having a stranglehold on several media in a 
single geographical market maxwell said that he supported 
regulations limiting such power 
maxwell communication corp plc last month acquired the new york 
publishing company macmillan inc for 25 billion 
maxwells promotional test issue was a 12page fullsized daily 
with news items and features from across europe illustrated with 
both blackandwhite and color photographs the issues editorial 
reflected maxwells opposition to mrs thatchers view of european 
integration 
the editorial said that mrs thatchers opposition to monetary 
union in the eec has blighted hopes that progress towards the 
unity of europe was accelerating 
the commentary piece added having haggled and hectored for 
years to reduce the cost of britains entry into europe she has now 
deliberatly created a new hostility to the whole concept which 
alarms and depresses britains friends 
maxwells newspaper carries its name in big bold letters across 
the top of the entire front page and below it in smaller letters 
is written forward with europe

interest rates jumped and stocks slipped today in reaction to a 
government report that the economy created 463000 jobs in november 
and a record percentage of the american population was at work 
the signs of economic growth were regarded as more significant 
than a slight uptick in the civilian unemployment rate which rose 
to 54 percent from a 14year low of 53 percent in october 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
dipped 853 points to 209335 after half an hour of trading 
the dollar was little changed in active trading ordinarily the 
dollar would rise in response to evidence of strong economic growth 
but there was little buying interest 
the market has totally and unequivocally ignored whatever 
positive news for the dollar there has been said john mccarthy 
chief currency dealer for amsterdam rotterdam bank in new york 
the 01 percentage point increase from octobers jobless rate was 
due almost entirely to a 560000 increase in the civilian labor 
force the number of people either holding jobs or looking for 
them the labor department said 
the labor force had remained essentially unchanged from august 
through october and has grown by only 2 million people in the past 
12 months including the big gain in november reflecting a tapering 
off of the baby boom generation entering the job market 
despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate the 
government figures showed 116 million americans holding jobs last 
month or 626 percent of the adult population age 16 or over both 
are record highs said labor statistics commissioner janet l 
norwood 
strong employment gains raise fears that the economy will 
overheat and prices will rise that hurts the value of fixedincome 
securities 
the price of the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 1 316 
point or 1188 per 1000 face amount its yield which rises when 
the price falls climbed to 913 percent from 902 percent late 
thursday 
there were rumors that the federal reserve would raise its 
discount rate to cool off the economy such a move would push up 
shortterm interest rates in general making the dollar more 
attractive to the worlds investors 
but the dollar was flat to slightly lower in hectic trading 
today at about 1213 japanese yen and 173 west german marks 
on thursday the commerce department said its main economic 
barometer indicated a possible slowing of the economys expansion 
during october it said its index of leading indicators edged up 01 
percent after falling the previous month 
analysts cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions until the 
index used to forecast the economys direction established a 
consistent pattern 
the index has declined in five of the past 12 months it dropped 
a revised 03 percent in september compared with the previous 
estimate of minus 01 percent it also fell in july and may but 
rose in june and august 
when the economy is slowing the federal reserve board is less 
likely to move interest rates higher 
the financial markets all but disregarded the leading indicators 
report awaiting instead todays release of the november 
unemployment figures activity on all markets was light as many 
investors stayed on the sidelines 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks up 
nearly 40 points over the past three sessions fell 1263 to close 
at 210188 
the dollar was little changed in foreign exchange trading 
the bond market reacted positively to the leading indicators 
with the treasurys key 30year issue rising about 5 for every 
1000 in face amount in a separate report thursday the commerce 
department said construction activity rose 09 percent in october to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4092 billion the fourth 
consecutive monthly increase 
strength was in most categories but half the gain came in 
singlefamily homes the department said 
in other economic news the nations largest general retailers 
reported their sales continued at a sluggish pace in november but 
an endofthemonth surge was a positive sign for the christmas 
shopping season

choosing a retailing stock these days is about as 
easy as finding the right christmas gift for your hardtoplease 
uncle 
there may be a wide selection to choose from but it takes a lot 
of looking before you can settle on the right one 
with a sales slump that has dragged on for nearly two years the 
retailing sector has not been at the top of many investors buy 
lists 
the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc for example 
recommended last month that investors purchase just two out of 40 
us retailing companies 
and as stacy ruchlamer an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc said in an evaluation of the retailing sector in late 
november selectivity is paramount she recommended six out of 
19 stocks 
retailing stocks fell out of favor well before the oct 19 market 
crash last year stagnant sales and stores declining profits cast a 
pall on the entire sector and when investors learned that fall 1987 
fashion lines had flopped they began dumping retailing issues 
things got so antsy that last november when walmart stores 
incs sales were running about 8 percent ahead of yearearlier 
levels compared with the companys usual 13 percent several 
analysts slapped a sell recommendation on the discount retailer 
and walmart was and has been a consistent star of the retailing 
industry thriving when its competitors were stumbling 
but some of the casualties are making a comeback 
one of the most prominent examples is gap inc the specialty 
apparel retailers stock which had peaked at nearly 78 a share in 
august 1987 had plunged to just under 37 by a month later in two 
days alone it fell nearly 19 
now gap is showing up on buy lists 
goldman sachs amp co analyst joseph ellis in an analysis of gap 
late last month said the retailer is restoring its merchandising 
financial and management credibility as a growth retailer 
ellis cited the companys new styles which are generating 
improved sales and its cost controls among the reasons for his 
buy recommendation 
according to the analysis gap has conquered some of the problems 
that plagued the retail sector last year by offering a wide 
selection of merchandise that is distinctive from the fashions 
offered by other retailers one of the biggest complaints women had 
last years was they saw the same styles in store after store 
gaps success is evidence of how retailers can on an individual 
basis reclaim their lost glory but overall the sector remains 
under a pall as long as consumers spend more money on necessities 
and services and less at shopping malls 
with this gloomy reality analysts and retailers alike are 
casting a very cautious eye on the christmas shopping season this 
is makeitorbreakit time retailers earn about half their annual 
profits during the holidays 
although overall sales continued sluggish in november analysts 
said a postthanksgiving pickup indicated the stores might have a 
moderately good season no one however is predicting it will be 
great 
the retailers generally have cut their costs and reduced 
inventory in recent months to preserve their profits but as long as 
booming sales are a thing of the past a winning retail stock could 
remain hard to find

to provide federally required collision avoidance radar systems for

the offering of shares in stateowned british steel 
plc to private british investors was substantially 
oversubscribed the investment firm organizing the sale said 
friday 
applications were still being counted but investors applied for 
far more than the 452 million british steel shares on offer to the 
general public said gillian oakes of the british investment firm 
samuel montagu and co 
the deadline for applications was friday morning and trading in 
the shares is to begin monday 
british steel shares are priced at 125 pence or 231 each 
valuing the entire company at 25 billion pounds or the equivalent 
of 46 billion 
private investors apparently were undeterred by the recent drop 
in prices on the british stock market which has been unsettled by 
another rise in british interest rates and the recent strength of 
the pound the investors seem to have looked instead at british 
steels operating strengths and the high yield on the shares oakes 
said 
investors also apparently were not frightened off by the failure 
of the governments last privatization the sale of its onethird 
stake in british petroleum co plc last fall which flopped with 
investors because it coincided with the stock markets crash 
privatization is the process by which a stateowned company is 
turned over to public ownership 
the shares offered to private investors represent around 23 
percent of the total 2 billion british steel shares which the 
british government is selling the balance has been underwritten by 
british and overseas institutions 
if private investors apply for more than 762 million shares the 
bank will trigger a clawback mechanism reducing the number of 
shares offered to overseas institutions from 33 percent to 25 
percent of the total and if applications exceed 980 million shares 
british institutions will see their part in the issue reduced from 
44 percent to 33 percent

rjr nabisco incs prospective new owner says 
there are no plans to radically dissect the foodandcigarette giant 
to help pay a debt load that will quadruple to more than 20 
billion but securities analysts disagree 
id be totally amazed if there wasnt some stuff sold off 
neal kaplan who follows rjr for interstatejohnson lane securities 
in charlotte nc said thursday in assessing the aftermath of the 
biggest takeover deal in history 
i cant conceive of them keeping it intact 
after an exhaustive auction overseen by a special rjr directors 
committee buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co triumphed 
late wednesday over an rjr management group led by chief executive 
f ross johnson 
the directors accepted kohlbergs package of cash and securities 
valued at 109 a share for each of rjrs 225 million shares for a 
total of 2453 billion and rejected an offer from johnsons group 
valued at 112 a share or 252 billion 
they said both offers were nearly the same but kohlbergs offer 
would give shareholders a 25 percent stake in the acquired company 
compared with a 15 percent stake offered by johnson 
both offers would rely heavily on borrowed money to be repaid 
through rjrs earnings assets or both a transaction commonly 
called a leveraged buyout it was widely expected that kohlberg 
would sell many if not all of rjrs food businesses and leave its 
highly profitable tobacco business intact 
but kohlberg principal henry kravis told a few selected financial 
journalists in new york he foresaw no urgent reason to sell any of 
rjrs operations people familiar with his remarks said 
there will be no wholesale dismemberment of the company no 
immediate fire sale and that is still the case although 
obviously some businesses will have to be sold the sources 
paraphrased kravis as saying 
no decisions have been made yet on what to shed kravis was 
quoted as saying he also was said to have described the leveraged 
buyout as one of the most conservative his firm had ever done 
despite the enormous price 
disclosing more details of how the takeover will be financed 
kohlberg said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission today that four banks will lend 27 billion and assemble 
a syndicate of other banks to lend another 14 billion 
in addition the sec filing showed kohlbergs two main wall 
street financial backers drexel burnham lambert inc and merrill 
lynch amp co will lend 5 billion to be financed by highyield 
junk bonds and kohlbergs own pool of investors will provide 
the rest of the money 
kohlberg is the undisputed leader in leveraged buyouts which 
often leave acquired companies with staggering debt levels 
for example kohlbergs 1986 leveraged buyout of supermarket 
giant safeway stores inc for 42 billion left the acquired company 
with a debttoequity ratio of 10to1 
the rjr acquisition will more than quadruple the companys 
existing debt of 5 billion to 223 billion but the amount of 
equity in the acquired company is estimated at about 74 billion 
for a debttoequity ratio of 3to1 in leveraged buyouts that is 
considered low 
although kravis said he considered the fight for rjr over 
johnson and his chief financial backer shearson lehman hutton inc 
hinted thursday that they were not finished 
johnson said in a statement he had spoken with kravis and assured 
him that if the boards action results in kohlberg kravis roberts 
owning the company i will work with him toward a professional and 
smooth transition 
but the statement also said johnson and his investmentbanking 
allies are evaluating their options 
some analysts speculated that johnson considered a daring 
corporate boss might take the unprecedented step of sidestepping 
the board of the company he still heads and making an offer directly 
to stockholders 
rjrs stock price rose about 66 percent during the 5week 
takeover saga partly on the prospect that everhigher offers would 
emerge but the stock fell 125 thursday to 9175 in heavy 
trading evidently reflecting the view that kohlbergs package of 
81 in cash and 28 in securities was worth less than its face 
amount the stock retreated another 75 cents this morning to 91 
the rjr takeover battle focused nationwide attention on the 
growing leveraged buyout trend and the enormous debt burdens many 
companies are acquiring in such transactions some economists fear 
these heavily indebted companies could face unprecedented pressure 
in a downturn 
underscoring that concern moodys investors service lowered the 
credit rating on rjrs corporate bonds thursday saying it was 
worried about the ability of the company to generate enough money to 
service its increased debt 
at the same time metropolitan life insurance co a large rjr 
bondholder that sued the company last month when the value of its 
bonds sank amid the takeover fight said kohlbergs name might be 
added as a defendant

the nations civilian unemployment rate in 
november edged upward from a 14year low to 54 percent despite an 
increase of 463000 new jobs and a record percentage of the american 
population at work the government said today 
the 01 percentage point increase from octobers jobless rate of 
53 percent was due almost entirely to a 560000 increase in the 
civilian labor force the number of people either holding jobs or 
looking for them the labor department said 
the labor force had remained essentially unchanged from august 
through october and has grown by only 2 million people in the past 
12 months including the big gain in november reflecting a tapering 
off of the baby boom generation entering the job market 
despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate the 
government figures showed 116 million americans holding jobs last 
month or 626 percent of the adult population age 16 or over both 
are record highs said labor statistics commissioner janet l 
norwood 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater attributed the 
rise to a large increase in the labor force and noted that the 
total number of employed reached an alltime high there were more 
people looking for work he said 
the number of factory jobs climbed by 71000 in november on top 
of a fouryear recordhigh 99000 new assembly line workers in 
october following a slight decline in the late summer 
over the past year the number of factory jobs has risen by 
425000 norwood said in prepared testimony before the joint 
economic committee of congress this growth has been concentrated 
in a limited number of industries with machinery alone counting for 
more than a quarter of the gain 
meanwhile factory workers continued to average four hours of 
overtime a week last month indicating that the manufacturing sector 
is continuning to boom and there is no slowdown in the rate of 
economic growth 
many economists are concerned that inflation will continue 
increasing unless the growth rate is slowed but there was no 
indication that it did in november acording to the job figures the 
first economic indicator of the month 
construction employment increased by 55000 over the month 
reflecting an upturn in housing starts after sluggish activity from 
july through october 
the november job figures officially mark the sixth birthday of 
the current economic expansion the longest in the nations history 
but the pattern of growth has not been consistent throughout 
factory jobs for example rose by 14 million in the first two 
years of recovery following a loss of nearly 2 million jobs in the 
198182 recession but in 1985 and 1986 they declined by 600000 
before rebounding by 850000 over the past two years 
not unexpectedly changes in the unemployment rate for adult men 
have tracked closely with the factory job swings said norwood 
it fell from 10 percent to 62 percent during the initial rebound 
was unchanged in the middle years and dropped from 62 percent to 
48 percent in the past two years 
the pattern of female joblessness meanwhile has shown a more 
consistent gradual decline it too was 48 percent last month 
the service side of the economy added 345000 new jobs last 
month including 40000 in transportation reflecting an improvement 
in the health of the airline industry 
retail trade employment climbed by 19000 despite a decrease of 
2000 workers in department stores department store employment has 
now been falling for five months in a row an indication to some 
economists that consumer spending is slowing and that exports of 
us manufactred products abroad are propelling the nations 
continued growth 
health service jobs rose by 56000 last month while employment in 
business services such as data processing climbed by 31000 after 
several months of sluggish activity 
meanwhile average hourly earnings were unchanged at 945 in 
november after rising by a nickel in october setting off fears of a 
wagepush inflation then 
an alternate employment rate that includes the 17 million 
members of the armed forces stationed in the country also rose last 
month from 52 percent to 53 percent 
unemployment rates for various population groups showed little or 
no improvement they climbed from 11 percent to 112 percent for 
blacks from 77 percent to 81 percent for hispanics and from 265 
percent to 304 percent for black teenagers

in their latest and most likely final offer the 
management of rjr nabisco inc offered shareholders 8 billion more 
for their shares than in their first offer 
what is 8 billion 
among other things it is the asset value of a company the size 
of minnesota mining amp manufacturing co including about 180 plants 
and 370 sales offices and distribution centers in 49 countries 
or it is the assets of georgiapacific corp which owns or has 
cutting rights to 56 million acres of north american timberlands 
plus morton thiokol inc the aerospace contractor and a few 
hundred million dollars in change 
had shareholders accepted the first offer which was publicized 
as being in their interest they would have so to speak left that 
much on the table 
it is because of such mindboggling considerations as these that 
aspects of the rjr nabisco sale will be debated well into the next 
century and perhaps as long as business schools exist 
did shareholders get a fair deal it would seem so since the 
stock leaped in a few weeks from 55 a share to more than 90 but 
even after such good fortune some shareholders might not be as 
happy as you might think 
a good many rjr nabisco shareholders were longterm investors 
with an eye on the steady dividends of 5 percent or so a year which 
they had expected to continue well into the future 
these investors were not traders or sellers rjr nabisco was to 
them a source of income suddenly they have capital gains taxes to 
pay which when combined with state taxes could approach 40 percent 
what does the precipitous sale of an established company mean to 
holders of bonds big losses bonds purchased when the companys 
debt position was strong have inevitably lost value as the company 
becomes burdened with debt 
the questions drive at the very meaning of a company 
is a corporation a dynamic everchanging institution whose value 
to its immediate owners or to society at large lies in its 
unique ability to produce products and services 
or is it to be viewed as a static entity like a consumer product 
on a shelf to be sold and in the selling lose all its future value 
as a creator of change a payer of dividends an employer a 
taxpayer a producer 
how is the rjr nabisco management to be viewed or in fact the 
management of any company that promises to serve the shareholders 
creditors employees and customers but which plots to take the 
company for its own portfolio 
the meaning of insider trading a term used commonly to 
describe those outsiders who gain access to inside information and 
use it for their own financial gain might have to be reconsidered 
consider that prior to making their announcements buyout 
managements use privileged information to construct their offer 
they allow investors to buy bonds knowing that those bonds will 
fall in value on their announcement 
is it proper for management to arrange for the continuance of 
their salaries plus benefits bonuses and lucrative pensions should 
they fail in their takeover attempt and instead fall prey to a 
hostile offer 
is an insider takeover and dismantling a proper end for a 
thriving company built on the savings sacrifices and ingenuity of 
entrepreneurs the millions of manhours of labor the years of 
risks the hard times conquered 
in comparison what sacrifices ingenuity labor risks and hard 
times are incurred by a management that benefits from its failure 
ie that puts the company on the block because it thinks it might 
be better dead than alive 
the debate is only beginning

the recent ruling ordering a japanese computer 
company to pay international business machines corp for use of the 
software information running its computers was fair and should 
satisfy concerns over protecting intellectual property rights 
american arbitrators said friday 
in a landmark case two arbitrators assigned by the american 
arbitration association tuesday ordered japans largest computer 
firm fujitsu ltd to pay ibm 237 million and tens of millions of 
dollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plan for 
special access to ibms mainframe computer software 
including past payments fujitsu could pay ibm more than 1 
billion by the end of the century 
the decision followed years of wrangling between the worlds 
biggest computer company and its main japanese rival over what ibm 
claimed was fujitsus infringement on its intellectual property 
rights 
fujitsu competes with ibm in the mainframe computer business with 
a line of machines and accompanying baselayer software that are 
supposed to be able to run the same programs as the ibm mainframes 
exploiting often murky copyright laws japan has been accused in 
the past of altering imported technology to suit its own 
requirements the ruling by the arbitration association is expected 
to make japanese industry more cautious 
the days when ideas were free are now over said an editorial 
thursday in the asahi evening news 
by tradition japanese industry has relied on western 
technologies for growth freely borrowing them and adapting them 
cleverly to its own needs 
but this wont be acceptable in the future the editorial 
said the aaa ruling on the ibmfujitsu dispute will lend impetus 
to the mounting global trend toward demanding monetary payment for 
intellectual property 
mnookin a law professor at stanford law school said ibm had 
invested billions of dollars in its operating systems software 
while the precise scope of copyright protection is not entirely 
clear what is clear is that this investment in its property is 
worthy of protection he said 
he said the ruling was fair and balanced and one in which 
both parties were made substantially better off 
any concerns that customers may have had because of 
uncertainties about intellectual property rights with respect to 
compatible operating system software have now been put to rest 
jones said

about 2200 of the most senior chrysler 
corp workers in kenosha will continue to receive full pay and 
benefits after the dec 23 end of production in the city until a 
companyfunded 20 million job bank is depleted a union official 
says 
united auto workers local 72 shop committee chairman rudy kuzel 
said thursday the job bank was provided in the plant closing 
agreement negotiated with chrysler 
kuzel estimated it will take the 2200 employees about eight to 
nine weeks or until about march to deplete the 20 million 
after the money is gone the workers can turn to statesponsored 
unemployment compensation benefits and companyfunded supplemental 
unemployment benefits 
the job bank was formed as compensation for the transfer of 
lbody dodge omni and plymouth horizon model production from kenosha 
to chryslers jefferson avenue plant in detroit 
but the job bank is not just for those working on lbody 
kuzel said 
the contract said the 2200 most senior employees could be 
transferred to nontraditional work once the lbody line is moved 
but kuzel said he doubts enough work will remain in kenosha for all 
of them to actually be on the job 
regardless of whether they are working or not they will earn 
full pay and benefits he said 
the wisconsin job service has said that most chrysler corp 
employees losing their jobs as a result of the plant closing will be 
eligible for 200 weekly unemployment benefits for 26 weeks the 
union workers are to also receive sub benefits of 100 per week for 
24 weeks 
chrysler has said the ending of auto production in kenosha will 
put about 5300 people out of work about 1200 people are to 
continue working at the automakers engine operation in kenosha

mack trucks inc has unveiled a new truck 
with a larger cab and sleeping space that is aimed at the market of 
owneroperators 
mack chairman john c curcio showed off the new truck thursday 
predicting it would boost company profit and revenue 
if so mack would have consecutive profitable years for the first 
time since 197879 according to curcio 
curcio speaking at mack headquarters here said the ch600 truck 
would be produced at macks new factory in winnsboro sc the new 
factory replaced an aging plant in allentown 
what you are seeing today is the first truly allnew truck of 
the 1990s the chairman said 
he said the truck represented a fiveyear commitment by mack 60 
million in design and development plus millions of miles in testing 
we see the results of shortcutting this process far too often 
in todays supercompetitive truck industry curcio said we 
resisted the temptation to rush to the market with a rehashed 
version of the same old thing or to rush a lessthanfully 
developed and tested vehicle to market as some other manufacturers 
have done 
the innovations are expected to increase macks market share by 2 
to 3 percentage points by 1991 from its current share of about 15 
percent said paul ritter senior vice president of sales for the 
company 
after operating in red ink from 1982 through 1986 mack trucks 
earned 409 million in 1987 the company has said it expects to 
move further into the black this year 
through the first nine months of 1988 mack reported earnings of 
18 million on sales of 16 billion compared to a 15 million 
profit on sales of 14 billion during the same period in 1987 
the truck includes a new frame and chassis and aerodynamic 
efficiency was a key consideration in its design curcio said among 
aspects designed to smooth air flow around the truck are a twopiece 
windshield sloped 20 degrees and rounded and contoured lamps the 
company said 
the ch600 will be no more expensive than macks former 
conventional r truck averaging about 60000 
the ch600 and the e7 engine to be introduced for the truck in 
july or august are part of macks 500 million capital expenditure 
program begun by curcio in 1983 
part of curcios program was the replacement of the companys 
antiquated 5c assembly plant in allentown with one of the industrys 
most modern assembly plants production of the new truck is to begin 
jan 1 
last year mack introduced its cm400 its downsized baby 8 
intercity vehicle and began producing it in its macungie assembly 
plant the company also is spending 100 million to modernize its 
powertrain division in hagerstown md for production of the new 
e7 engine

concerns about the unusually dry weather in brazil and argentina 
the worlds second and fourthlargest soybean producers have 
become the dominant factor in the us soybean futures market since 
planting began in those countries earlier this fall

selling of futures on thursday but fridays forecasts indicated 
chances for rain were diminishing and that sparked a rally 
analysts said 
we ended up with a little bit of emotional action in the last 
hour of trading we were up and down here said jerry gidel an 
analyst in chicago with the gh miller division of lit america inc 
rumors that brazil was considering importing soybean oil from 
argentina either for its own needs or to export sent soybean oil

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co unveiled on friday 
the financing plan for its record 2453 billion purchase of rjr 
nabisco inc that includes a complex assortment of bank loans junk 
bonds and some cash from its own pocket 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission the 
powerful wall street buyout firm illustrated the techniques it 
typically uses in leveraged buyouts only on a far grander scale 
the lbo concept is quite simple after making a small 
downpayment a firm and its investors borrow the rest of the 
purchase and pay off that debt with funds generated by a target 
companys profits or asset sales in effect the business itself is 
used as collateral 
the borrowing process though can get confusing 
a lot of the financing is just plain vanilla thats not the 
case here said robert waill a highyield bond specialist with 
lf rothschild holdings inc 
the rjr buyout will require more than 20 billion in loans to 
finance the cash portion of the 109ashare offer accepted 
wednesday by a special rjr directors committee kohlbergs offer was 
selected over a 252 billion bid from a group led by f ross 
johnson rjrs chief executive 
besides getting 81 in cash for each of their shares rjr 
stockholders will receive a total 4 billion in preferred stock and 
23 bilion in convertible bonds 
kohlberg said in its sec filing that four banks bankers trust 
chase manhattan citibank and manufacturers hanover trust will 
lend 27 billion themselves and assemble a syndicate of other banks 
to lend an additional 14 billion 
kohlbergs two main wall street financial backers drexel burnham 
lambert inc and merrill lynch amp co will provide 5 billion in 
shortterm bridge loans that will be repaid by selling 
highyield highrisk junk bonds according to the sec filing 
and a spokeswoman for kohlberg 
another 5 billion of existing rjr debt also could become 
downgraded to junk bonds in the processs since the acquistion will 
more than quadruple the companys existing debt to 223 billion 
the buyout also will make rjr the largest single junk bond 
issuer analysts said union carbide corp now holds that 
distinction with 42 billion 
one major difference is that union carbide didnt issue them 
all at once said kenneth urbaszewski who manages 4 billion in 
junk bonds at kemper financial services in chicago 
but urbaszewski believes the highyield market can absorb the 
deluge of expected rjr debt as long as those issues are priced 
right 
theres plenty of cash out there now he said 
urbaszewski noted that despite the huge resulting debt load 
rjrs ratio of debt to equity would be only 3to1 which is 
considered low for a leveraged buyout by contrast kohlbergs 1986 
buyout of supermarket giant safeway stores inc for 42 billion 
left the acquired company with a debttoequity ratio of 10to1 
the higher the debt load the harder it is for a company to pay 
off its loans 
for its part kohlberg is putting up 15 billion in cash for the 
rjr acquisition most of which will come from a 5 billion pool of 
capital invested by institutional investors kohlberg also is 
lending 500 million for the acquisition the filing said 
a kohlberg spokeswoman said she did not know exactly how much of 
the 15 billion in cash was coming from the buyout firm itself 
however the washington post reported friday that kohlberg planned 
to put only slightly more than 15 million of its own money into the 
purchase

factor in the preciousmetals markets the 54 percent november 
jobless rate was near expectations but the increase of 463000 new

if youre looking at precious metals as an inflation hedge the 
unemployment numbers were quite positive said jack barbanel 
director of futures trading with gruntal amp co a new york brokerage 
firm

strong start helped fuel the preciousmetals rally 
news reports of a mutinous clash between loyal and rebel military 
factions near buenos aires argentina may also have sparked some 
buying among those who favor gold as a haven during turbulent times 
said scott hinton an analyst with elders futures inc in new york

resistance point at around 432 on the contract for february

stock prices fell friday but still displayed 
signs of resilience after the labor department issued an employment 
report that deepened investor concerns about inflation 
the market absorbed the negative news fairly well i didnt 
see a selling rout by any means said ralph acampora a market 
analyst with kidder peabody amp co 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 960 to 209228 
after having been down about 17 points in early trading the index 
closed out the week with a 1760point gain 
declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4to3 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
822 issues down 616 up and 504 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to a sluggish 12461 million 
shares down from 12938 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trading at regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market 
totaled 15079 million shares 
the labor departments monthly report on employment had been 
eagerly awaited by financial markets for indications on the 
direction of the economy 
but the news that 463000 new jobs were created last month came 
as a blow to traders because it meant the economy remained strong 
the markets believed the higherthanexpected gain in jobs would 
prompt the federal reserve board to raise its discount rate to keep 
a lid on inflation 
bond prices slumped on the news with the treasurys 30year 
issue skidding about 15 per 1000 in face amount by late 
afternoon meanwhile the bonds yield surged to about 916 percent 
from late thursdays 902 percent and shortterm interest rates 
also moved higher 
wall street took its cue from the credit markets opening lower 
and continuting to slide but as the afternoon wore on blue chip 
issues recovered some lost ground 
most market participants were suprised that the market was not 
hit harder said alfred goldman an analyst with ag edwards amp 
sons inc in st louis 
acampora the kidder peabody analyst said a lot of the 
negative news was already discounted in the market 
goldman said wall street faces a critical test in coming sessions 
because of competition from the increasingly attractive yields of 
shortterm debt and moneymarket instruments 
oneyear t treasury bills offer extremely stiff competition 
for the stock market goldman said yields on oneyear bills 
reached 894 percent by late friday 
if the dow jones industrial average falls through the 2030 mark 
and other market indicators drop below important psychological 
levels christmas and the first of the new year will bring little 
cheer and there will be trouble well into the first quarter for 
wall street goldman said 
however if stocks hold at these levels it will signal that 
there are enough buyers around who feel that stocks are 
attractive he said 
the mostactively traded issue on the nyse was rjr nabisco which

the governments report of strongerthanexpected 
job growth in november stunned the bond market friday sending 
prices sharply lower and interest rates higher on speculation that 
the federal reserve may tighten credit conditions to slow economic 
growth 
bond traders who were anticipating a rise of about half of the 
463000 new jobs reported were shocked by the numbers and sold 
bonds on the report said maury harris economist for the investment 
firm painewebber inc 
the selloff was described as orderly however and the market 
soon stabilized at the lower levels 
some analysts said the job growth figure indicated the economy is 
expanding so quickly that the federal reserve will move to tighten 
credit and possibly boost the rate it charges on loans to financial 
institutions to slow the economy down and avoid a resurgence of 
inflation 
elliott platt fixedincome research director for donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities said chances of a halfpoint increase 
in the feds discount rate to 7 percent next week are fairly 
high 
but harris and some other analysts said they did not expect the 
fed to raise the discount rate so quickly and pointed to other 
parts of the same jobs report as evidence that the economy is not 
overheating 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond dropped 1 points or 
1375 for every 1000 in face amount its yield which moves in 
the opposite direction from its price climbed to 916 percent from 
902 percent late thursday 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer dropped 926 to 112920 its biggest oneday 
drop since it fell 948 on nov 4 after the october employment 
report also showed unexpected strength 
shortterm interest rates rocketed higher yields on oneyear 
treasury bills for instance jumped to 894 percent from 863 
percent late thursday 
the activity was triggered early friday when the labor department 
reported 463000 jobs were created in november many analysts had 
expected an increase of about 250000 
but some economists said the market appeared to overlook other 
evidence contained in the report that suggested another view of the 
economy 
it really isnt as strong as it seems said robert brusca 
chief economist for nikko securities international 
marshall b front vice president at the investment firm stein 
roe amp farnham in chicago said the report showed the economy may be 
moderating 
he said the unemployment rate for instance rose a tenth of a 
percentage point to 54 percent in november the average work week 
edged down 12 minutes and average hourly wages were unchanged in 
addition front noted the report revised estimated job growth in 
october to 238000 from the 323000 initially reported 
ill bet they wont raise the discount rate there are enough 
signs of easing in the economy to forestall such an increase he 
said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell by point to point intermediate maturities lost 
point and 20year issues fell nearly a full point according to 
telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
in corporate trading industrials were lower moodys investment 
grade corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer fell 170 
to 29343 
in the taxexempt market prices fell more than point 
according to the bond buyers index of 40 activelytraded municipal 
issues 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 831 percent as the 
discount climbed 20 basis points to 804 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills rose to 872 percent as the discount jumped 25 basis 
points to 825 percent with yields on oneyear bills rising to 894 
percent the discount on those issues rose 27 basis points to 828 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 8 916 percent up from 8 percent late 
thursday

rko general inc on friday completed the 
320 million sale of los angeles television station khj to the walt 
disney co marking a milestone toward ending a 23year dispute 
between rko and federal regulators 
of the purchase price 103 million or 32 percent goes to a 
broadcast company that challenged the fitness of rko and its parent 
gencorp to hold a broadcasters license gencorp based in 
fairlawn ohio gets 217 million the companies said 
the payment to the challenger fidelity television inc was 
ordered by the federal communications commission as part of a 
settlement of license challenges based on allegations of improper 
billings and other fcc rule violations by rko 
the commission stripped rko of one television license in 1980 
and in effect is forcing the company to sell khj and its 13 other 
radio and tv stations on unfavorable terms 
sale of khj the biggest of rkos stations and the starting point 
of the dispute is intended to serve as a model for disposal of the 
rest of the stations 
this signals a watershed event for us said gencorp spokesman 
rip tilden were out of operation of khjtv were getting out 
of the broadcast business 
the sale was completed a day after khjs broadcast license came 
up for renewal and was awarded to los angelesbased fidelity the 
sale agreement calls for disney to run the station and for fidelity 
to eventually transfer the license to disney 
the sale was set up by a settlement among rko various 
competitors and the fcc that was approved by the commission in july 
the arrangement which fcc records indicate was intended to both 
punish rko and bring the dispute to a speedy end calls for sale of 
the companys remaining properties a tv station and nine radio 
stations on similar terms 
rkos trouble with the fcc began in 1965 when fidelity 
challenged its fitness to hold a license for khj in that complaint 
and in other challenges ultimately filed to all rkos licenses the 
companys business practices and the corporate character of its 
parent then known as general tire amp rubber co were called into 
question 
in a 1980 ruling that stripped rko of its license to run wnactv 
in boston the commission found that gencorp rko and the various 
stations had engaged in improper billing submission of false 
financial statements and demonstrated lack of concern for fcc rules 
and federal laws 
in weighing the challenges the commission also considered 
evidence general tire had engaged in schemes which defrauded 
partially owned affiliate companies of millions of dollars made 
improper political contributions and bribed foreign officials to 
further its business interests according to fcc records 
gencorp spokesman tilden noted the company hasnt acknowledged 
any violations of fcc rules he said the decision to sell all the 
stations and eliminate rko is in keeping with a gencorp business 
strategy of focusing on its main industrial operations which 
include making aerospace and automotive components and plastic 
products 
we feel we are perfectly fit to operate a broadcast station 
tilden said 
one of the unusual aspects of the settlement is the fccs 
allowing disney which wasnt a part of the license challenges to 
enter as a white knight to buy khj 
weve always taken a position with the commission that we 
thought disney would be a nice opportunity to get someone in there 
to resolve what has been a messy situation for 20 years said neil 
mccarthy the disney vice president who arranged the deal 
sale agreements similar to the khj deal have been approved for 
rkos whbqam in memphis tenn wgmsam in bethesda md wgmsfm 
in washington dc and wrkoam and wrorfm in boston 
the company is seeking buyers for woram and wrksfm in new york 
city krtham and krthfm in los angeles kfrcam in san francisco 
waxyfm in fort lauderdale fla wfyrfm in chicago and whbqtv in 
memphis

news that record numbers of americans are working jolted the 
financial markets by raising fears that the federal reserve will 
tighten credit to squelch rapid economic growth and preempt higher 
inflation 
the labor department said friday that civilian unemployment in 
november edged upward to 54 percent from a 14year low of 53 
percent largely because of an expansion in the civilian labor force 
but the departments report also showed an increase of nearly a 
halfmillion new jobs which means a record 116 million americans or 
626 percent of the adult population are gainfully employed 
the number frightened bondholders because it suggested the 
economy is growing so rapidly that inflation will rise forcing the 
fed to raise interest rates the standard remedy for taming a 
growthprice spiral higher interest rates hurt bonds and other 
fixedincome investments 
the treasurys key 30year bond lost 1375 per 1000 in face 
amount and its yield which often portends other interest rate 
increases rose to 916 percent from 902 percent late thursday 
the bond markets anxiety spilled into the stock market though 
not as badly the dow jones industrial average fell 960 to 
209228 closing out the week with a 1760 point gain 
ordinarily higher interest rates rally the dollar because they 
make dollardenominated holdings worth more but in a curious twist 
the dollar fell friday because foreignexchange traders didnt 
foresee an immediate move by the fed to tighten credit 
the unemployment report dominated the news friday and obscured 
other government statistics that presented a mixed picture 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
rose 35 percent in october to the highest level in more than 1 
years it followed a drop of 14 percent in september 
the department also said us factory orders rose 35 billion 
or 16 percent in october to a seasonally adjusted 2262 billion 
on the strength of big gains in orders for military ships and tanks 
but the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a 
good barometer of industry investment plans fell 30 percent to 
338 billion following a large 102 percent drop in september

bear said jim fiedler vice president in charge of energy 
brokering for edampf man international futures inc

success of the accord

market is waiting until january to whats going to happen hiley

rjr nabisco incs chief executive is cooperating 
with the buyout firm that defeated him in a frenetic takeover 
struggle for the cigarettefood giant formally signaling he has no 
intention of reopening the fight 
as you well know we have just concluded what has been a long 
difficult and arduous process f ross johnson said in a joint 
letter with henry r kravis a principal in the investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
however that process has ended and it is now most important 
that we return immediately to actively and vigorously running our 
business said the letter sent friday to rjrs 120000 employees 
worldwide 
addressing the concern of employees about their futures the 
letter also attempted to assure employees them that all of your 
existing health and medical plans and all of your retirement and 
pension plans will continue in full force and effect 
the letter also said kohlberg has great flexibility and is 
under no pressure to make immediate divestitures 
nevertheless the letter confirmed press accounts that the new 
owner anticipated that the sale of 6 billion in various food 
assets is likely to occur over the next twelve to twentyfour 
months 
there was no further indication of what those assets were but 
the letter told employees we can also assure you that there will 
be no mass liquodations of our assets or any mass layoff of 
employees both our goal and commitment is to grow this company in a 
most responsible manner 
johnson was outmaneuvered by kohlberg in a spectacular bidding 
war for the nations 19th largest industrial company maker of 
hundreds of products that range from camel cigarettes to oreo 
cookies to triscuit snacks 
the struggle climaxed late wednesday when rjrs directors 
accepted kohlbergs 109ashare 2453 billion package of cash and 
securities the biggest takeover agreement in history 
kohlberg won despite a seemingly higher 112ashare 252 
billion package of cash and securities offered by johnson and his 
financial backers defying widespread predictions that the scrappy 
rjr boss would win 
the directors concluded both offers were substantially the same 
and opted to go with the investment firms because of its 
established record in takeovers and its commitment to preserving as 
much of the company as possible postmortem accounts of the 
decision showed 
they also were said to be dismayed at the brazen greed exhibited 
by johnson who originally offered 75 a share for the company in 
what he admitted was a deliberate buylow approach 
johnson was said to feel cheated by the boards announcement and 
his first reaction was to reiterate he believed his final offer was 
better he also dropped hints the battle was not over saying he was 
exploring my options 
but the joint letter with kravis showed he had scrapped any plans 
to challenge the boards decision 
both offers were for leveraged buyouts a highfinance 
transaction in which the buyer puts up only a fraction of the 
purchase price and borrows the rest repaying it with the target 
companys earnings sale of assets or both 
the highly publicized struggle focused new attention on leveraged 
buyouts because they saddle companies with enormous debt and often 
lead to their breakup there is growing concern over whether 
leveraged buyouts are playing a harmful role in the economy 
kohlbergs takeover of rjr will more than quadruple the companys 
debt to nearly 24 billion raising speculation the new owner will 
have to sell substantial parts of the atlantabased giant to service 
that debt
