city officials have asked for reports on whether 
police prevented fire department divers from joining the search for 
a victim trapped in a sightseeing helicopter that crashed and sank 
in the east river 
a fire lieutenant was quoted as saying he had eight divers at 
the scene sunday morning but police kept them away at a time when 
only two police divers were in the water 
it took 90 minutes to find the helicopter in the rivers murk 
and free the trapped passenger takashi oyama a japanese 
businessman oyama 29 was taken to bellevue hospital where he 
died nine hours later 
the pilot and three other passengers none seriously injured 
escaped to the surface and were taken to hospitals 
the national transportation safety board also said it would look 
into the issue of whether rescue was impeded by policefirefighter 
rivalry if it received information that such a dispute had occurred 
police commissioner benjamin ward said two police divers were in 
the water by 1037 am 14 minutes after the first report of the 
crash by 1045 nine divers were conducting a pattern search of 
the area he said 
fire commissioner joseph bruno said two fire department divers 
were there at 1037 and that eight were on the scene by 1045 
ward dismissed as a personal opinion an earlier statement by 
fire lt patrick brown of rescue co 1 that the search was impeded 
because his divers were not allowed to join it 
it was the feeling of the police commander on the scene and in 
fact the common practice of all experienced water rescuers that 
uncoordinated search teams in the water at the same time is 
dangerous and unproductive ward said in explaining why the fire 
departments offer was declined 
bruno said the rescue effort was within the purview of the 
police department and i have no problem with that i do have a 
problem with reports saying we are not needed and unnecessary our 
feeling is that if resources were available they should be 
utilized 
mayor edward i koch said he has asked for a report to find 
out whether all of the assistance on the scene was properly used 
the mayor said he would not speculate before he got the 
information 
in line with rules laid down by koch last year to end 
jurisdiction disputes police were in charge at sundays crash 
site a nonfire emergency the fire department calls the shots at 
fire emergencies 
first deputy mayor stanley brezenoff said the only question is 
were there enough divers in the water to make the rescue without 
using fire divers 
the crashed helicopter a bell jet ranger operated by island 
helicopter corp of garden city plunged from 1400 feet after a 
15to20minute tour of manhattan 
frank ghiorsi chief of the federal safety boards new york 
office said particular attention would be given seat belts and the 
pontoons which separated from the craft on impact 
oyama was snarled in his belt and had to be cut free said 
michael rivadeneyra one of divers who found the helicopter in 35 
feet of water

image is everything in the roughandtumble world 
of chicago politics says mayor eugene sawyer but after four 
months surrounded by the trappings of power he admits his image 
isnt what it should be 
his enemies gripe about his willingness to reward friends and 
his friends gripe about his unwillingness to punish enemies 
i might become a little more aggressive harder than i used to 
be but thats because the job will make me so the softspoken 
mayor said during a recent interview 
everything you do or say in this office is political or 
somebody will couch it that way and force you to respond in a 
political manner you try to be a statesman but hey you better be 
a politician too he added otherwise you wont be around very 
long 
people have all kinds of plans for you and i just say that if 
im going to make a mistake it will be one i made myself not 
something that somebody suggested to me said sawyer 58 
sawyer became embroiled in a new controversy this weekend when 
religious leaders accused mayoral community liaison aide steve 
cokely of repeatedly using racial and religious slurs against jews 
and christians in a series of taperecorded lectures to followers 
of nation of islam leader louis farrakhan 
mayoral spokesman monroe anderson said sawyer planned to ask 
cokely 35 to tune down his rhetoric but did not plan to fire 
him 
sawyer became mayor following the death in november of harold 
washington who became the citys first black mayor in 1983 and had 
consolidated his power over the cook county democratic party 
washington had served only eight months of his second term and 
sawyer must at some point face an election if he wants to stay in 
office but the date of the next mayoral election is up in the air 
the chicago board of election commissioners ruled last week that 
an election would be held in 1989 if city clerk walter kozubowski 
declared the mayors office vacant kozubowski said he wouldnt do 
so unless ordered by a court 
his opposition virtually assures the controversy will be 
resolved in court already competing lawsuits arguing for either a 
1989 or 1991 election are pending 
sawyer has said he is prepared to run whenever the next election 
is scheduled 
no matter what the date observers say the absence of a 
political giant like washington or the late mayor richard j daley 
will show how splintered this citys oncevaunted democratic 
machine has become 
therell be so many people running black white green 
that nobody will know what to do said black activist lu palmer 
credited with organizing the grassroots campaign that elected 
washington to his first term 
and theres scores of people talking about running for 
everything from dogcatcher to mayor and nobodys got the power to 
tell them no he continued 
machines move with precision if there was a chief like 
harold things would still be done with precision he said but 
now youve got a lot of little chieftains and everybodys throwing 
things in the way 
sawyer has had a difficult time shouldering the mantle since he 
was elected by a city council coalition made up mostly of white 
antiwashington aldermen 
some people were with harold because they believed in him 
some because they feared him and some because he proved he could 
win said alderman danny davis 
everybody knew there would be some slippage after he died 
added davis but nobody knew how much 
the coalition that put sawyer in office already has shown a 
tendency to fray at the seams his bloc held together long enough 
to pass washingtons record budget but grumbling set in almost 
immediately afterward and many of sawyers legislative proposals 
are languishing in the council 
and during the primary elections in march several black 
aldermen who were among sawyers most identifiable supporters got 
clobbered in races for party committeeman positions normally 
aldermen are shooins for those posts 
what that told me is that the voters in my ward dont like 
him said william beavers one of the aldermen and they may 
not be crazy about me standing behind him either

welfare officials celebrating the first 
anniversary of mississippis workfare program say theyve shown 
that even the nations poorest state can take those who have never 
had a steady job or who havent worked in years off the dole 
while congress debated the most comprehensive welfare reform 
bill in 50 years mississippi department of public welfare 
officials lauded their program for turning workfare jobs into 
paying employment for 109 of the 765 food stamp recipients 
participating so far 
welfare recipients they said may be pulling themselves up by 
their own bootstraps largely because of the states poverty 
were not distressed by the current economic situation in 
fact i get a personal kick from trying to do more with less 
welfare commissioner thomas brittain said 
mississippi has the lowest per capita income in the nation at 
10204 20 percent of its residents rely on food stamps 
a lot of people including some who work here in this 
department said workfare cant work in mississippi brittain 
recalled the reasons they gave me for that is its a ruralbased 
state that we have high unemployment 
but brittain said he knew workfare could work in mississippi 
because although local governments and private nonprofit groups 
were short of revenue for needed services there were tremendous 
numbers of people on welfare who in my opinion were able to work 
gloria rutledge a regional food program specialist in the us 
department of agricultures atlanta office agreed that 
mississippis poverty has contributed to its workfare success 
i dont know that this would have worked so well in some other 
place rutledge said of the program which requires clients to 
work for government the number of hours times the minimum wage that 
equals the value of their food stamp allotment 
she said because so many mississippi agencies cant afford to 
hire people to perform necessary tasks theyll give workfare 
participants doing those jobs more responsibility and training than 
they would otherwise 
she also noted that mississippi workfare participants can more 
easily be recommended to private industry as solid proven 
employees because they work an average of six months before 
brittain personally presents their resumes at a meeting of local 
business owners and managers in their community 
rutledge said that with 16 counties participating so far 
mississippi probably has the largestscale food stamp workfare 
program in the southeast brittain said he hopes to include all of 
the states 82 counties within a few years 
each countys board of supervisors must opt to join 
mississippis version of the federally authorized program 
participating counties pay 1250 monthly to cover each workfare 
clients travel and other miscellaneous expenses with the federal 
government matching that amount 
food stamp recipients in participating counties must sign up for 
workfare job find or educational programs in the past year 1972 
of 5448 clients in the participating counties opted to discontinue 
receiving food stamps rather than meet the requirements of one of 
the three options 
fortyfour states have a workfare program tied to the aid to 
families with dependent children program according to federal 
officials in washington 
among the workfare success stories provided by brittain is the 
case of cecil walker a longtime unemployed offshore oilfield 
worker walker began his workfare assignment as a novice in the 
welfare departments printing office his workfare training later 
allowed him to select from among several print shop job offers at 
what he said is a livable salary 
its something when your children say i want this and i want 
that daddy walker said now i cant get everything they 
want but i get everything they need and some of the things they 
want

except for the thunder of aircraft 
taking off and the showers of flares overhead soviet soldiers 
serving at a base near kabul airport could almost convince 
themselves they are in the soviet union 
the corrugated metal huts and wooden barracks are typical of 
bases in their native land 
beside each cot in the bunkhouses are tubes of soviet 
toothpaste soviet soap and soviet mirrors purchased at the base 
store 
russian women like oksana okulova serve breakfast lunch and 
dinner to the soldiers on soviet crockery afterward the women 
wash up while the men go off to train afghan government troops and 
help them defend the city against attack by anticommunist rebels 
the hearty breads cherished by soviets are baked at the base 
each day and familiar foods like ham cheese and apples are flown 
in for the soldiers who eschew the spicy afghan dishes 
but the flares which are released by aircraft to deflect 
heatseeking stinger missiles serve as a reminder that the 
soldiers are in danger even inside the closely guarded confines of 
the base 
of course its dangerous flying here tiit tommela an army 
major from soviet estonia told visiting foreign journalists we 
have to take precautions against your stingers 
afghan guerrillas who have been fighting the prosoviet 
government for 10 years use the ussupplied missiles effectively 
against government aircraft 
ms okulova a 25yearold who sought an escape from the 
industrial russian city of voronezh said the aviation dangers are 
the only aspect of her life in afghanistan she finds frightening 
we hardly ever leave the base so its easy to just keep 
occupied and not think about the fact that there is a war going 
on she said we are forbidden to go to the markets and when 
we go on touring trips we travel as a group 
officers refused to say how many soldiers serve at the sprawling 
complex that provides security for the capital kabul and the 
aircraft serving it it appears to house at least 1000 soviets 
on saturday as the noon sun burst through rainclouds in the 
mountains ringing kabul a squad of soviet paratroopers in 
camouflage jumpsuits lined up on the sports field to teach afghans 
the art of handtohand combat 
nearby soldiers worked with two german shepherds trained to 
sniff out explosives hidden in items like canteens and matchboxes 
there are occasional problems with the men ms okulova 
admitted when asked how she and several dozen other service workers 
deal with so many lonely soldiers far from home 
but several factors limit the potential for romantic problems 
strict rules forbid intimate relationships there is little privacy 
in the dormitories and barracks and the women must work long 
hours mrs okulova said 
the soviets plan to start pulling out of afghanistan on may 15 
under an accord signed last month in geneva however the kabul 
base may be one of the last closed by the soviets 
because there is no firm exit date the soldiers at the base 
have a businessasusual attitude although they admit to being 
eager to return home 
we will go when we are told to go said alexander alexandrov 
of the ukrainian city of kharkov everything here is normal for 
the time being although we are of course happy that a settlement 
has been reached in geneva 
soviet soldiers intervened in december 1979 to support the 
government and about 115000 remain in afghanistan 
in keeping with moscows official contention that afghanistans 
army is now strong enough to defend the country without soviet 
fighting power the soldiers had high praise for the forces loyal 
to president najib 
they will resolve their own problems said andrei tarelkin 
a paratrooper from the russian city of ivanovo he was one of 
several decorated heroes turned out in full parade uniform saturday 
for the benefit of the visitors 
the afghan army is young but it should be able to defend 
itself 
some western observers here expect the rebel forces based in 
pakistan to move north and take control of parts of afghanistan as 
the soviets retreat najibs regular army numbers only about 40000 
soldiers many of them underage conscripts likely to flee if 
government positions becomes indefensible

the top aide to a maryland congressman jumped to 
his death from a hotel window sunday after the washington post 
reported he had made bizarre demands of male staff members 
including asking one to do a striptease 
tom pappas 46 chief assistant to rep roy p dyson fell 18 
stories to a seventhfloor roof of the helmsley palace hotel said 
police spokesman lt stephen davis 
the death appeared to be a suicide davis said pappas left a 
note on hotel stationery he said but he declined to disclose its 
contents 
the post article quoted former staff members as saying dyson had 
ceded control of his washington office to pappas the newspaper 
said pappas used money from dysons reelection campaign to recruit 
for a company pappas owned offering salaries up to 50000 for 
single young men then coerced them to socialize with him 
dyson a 39yearold democrat was registered in a different 
room from pappas sunday at the hotel davis said the congressman 
was interviewed by detectives who would not comment on the 
questioning 
a hotel operator said a roy p dyson was registered but was not 
answering his phone 
dyson was elected to the house in 1980 unseating rep robert a 
bauman a conservative republican who was caught in a scandal when 
the post reported he was seen in public with young male prostitutes 
the posts frontpage article about dyson sunday came as the 
federal election commission investigates allegations his campaign 
disclosure reports concealed 6650 in payments to pappas 
pappas paid 72200 as dysons administrative assistant last 
year also owns a company pappenbauer associates that received 
119642 in fees and expenses since 1980 a revised dyson campaign 
reports shows 
mark frazer republican chairman in dysons district told the 
easton md stardemocrat he filed the complaint that led to the 
fec investigation but it was the post that had raised questions 
about sexual discrimination and what frazer called the apparently 
established preference for young males in the recruiting and hiring 
practices 
the newspaper quoted dyson staff members as saying pappas told 
one male employee that he would have to perform a striptease at a 
1987 office retreat the unidentified aide refused 
scott ourth was quoted as saying that when he was recruited to 
be dysons press secretary in december 1986 he was told he could 
not date for a year and should devote all his time to the office 
ourth quit within six months 
the article also quoted andy hira 22 a special assistant to 
pappas as saying he was fired for refusing to stay at a party in 
dysons annapolis hotel suite last november after dyson announced 
he would run for reelection in 1988 fellow staff member james fox 
quit because of similar demands hira was quoted as saying 
the newspaper quoted a memo from pappas dated nov 14 as saying 
it is important for everyone on this staff to remember that 
tom pappas is the chief of staff responsible for everyones 
paycheck when he expresses a wish however slight it should be 
taken seriously 
those interviewed were quoted as saying they did not believe the 
pressure went beyond attending dinners and parties organized by 
pappas former aides also were quoted as saying pappas excluded 
female staff members from his social activities 
the newspaper said pappas issued a statement saying dysons 
office has been run in an efficient and wellstructured manner 
the office has been managed in a way which has served the people of 
the 1st congressional district of maryland well for many years 
neighbors and former staff members told the post that dyson 
frequently stays at pappas large frame house in accokeek md 
about 20 miles south of washington dysons residence is further 
south in st marys county

margaret mitchell called it the dump and in 
its current state the apartment where she wrote much of gone 
with the wind shows the effects of care by those who frankly 
couldnt give a damn 
the threestory brick and stucco building sits in the middle of 
a muddy lot in midtown atlanta its windows are broken or boarded 
its roof is sunken and torn its walls are sooty 
but a group with 850000 in financial backing wants to save the 
74yearold building saying it represents possibly the last chance 
for atlanta to properly honor one of its most celebrated residents 
developers on the other hand say the dump cant be 
restored and should be razed to create a park to complement a 
recent flurry of construction in the neighborhood 
miss mitchell and her husband john marsh rented a firstfloor 
apartment at what was then called windsor house apartments from 
1926 to 1932 she was killed in a 1949 automobile accident 13 years 
after her epic novel of the old south and reconstruction was 
published 
the fate of the building is in federal court trammell crow co 
which purchased the property in 1985 sued the city in january 
after mayor andrew young refused to sign a demolition permit for 
the apartment building young had said he would support demolition 
as a last resort but the preservationist group came along and 
young agreed to try to save the building 
trammell crow had begun landscaping work around the building 
meanwhile the group mitchell house inc is drumming up support 
for a mitchell memorial project 
john taylor president of the group says most of the other 
atlanta sites where miss mitchell lived have been destroyed 
leaving few physical reminders of the writer 
this is one of our last opportunities he said 
taylor said wants to restore the building to the way it was in 
miss mitchells time display the apartment where she did her 
writing and establish a writerinresidence program 
while previous attempts at gone with the wind attractions 
focused on the popular 1939 movie taylor said the apartment 
project would emphasize miss mitchells book 
wed like to keep the literary aspect in the forefront he 
said 
the literary emphasis also would keep the project from becoming 
merely a tourist attraction he said though the lack of a major 
gone with the wind center in atlanta is a major impetus for the 
effort 
taylor said the restoration effort has raised about 850000 in 
cash pledges and pledged services he said it also has the 
endorsement from miss mitchells only remaining heirs two nephews 
among the opponents are those who were acquainted with miss 
mitchell and say she would be against the memorial 
im opposed to saving what she called the dump because 
margaret mitchell herself told me on several occasions that she 
wanted no museums or landmarks preserved in her memory columnist 
celestine sibley wrote recently in the atlanta constitution 
but taylor said there are many misconceptions about miss 
mitchell and the project would offer a chance to clarify her 
background and the recent announcement that a gone with the 
wind sequel is being written by a virginia author will generate 
even more interest he added 
john decker marketing principal at trammel crow said the 
developer sponsored two studies of the site before deciding that 
restoring the apartment was not feasible 
one study he said found that the deterioration of the building 
was worse than expected the other concluded that the funds needed 
for the project an estimated 2 million would not be available 
if trammel crows plans proceed the park would have a 
historical marker designating the site as the location of miss 
mitchells onetime residence decker said any surviving or 
significant items from the building would be saved for inclusion in 
a possible traveling museum of gone with the wind memorobilia 
he said

a new chocolate that wont melt in 
90degree temperatures has been developed in the hightechnology 
kitchens of the columbusbased battelle memorial institute a 
spokesman said 
food technologists at battelles laboratory in geneva 
switzerland are licensing rights to the new chocolate formulation 
said laboratory spokesman bernard l vollerin 
chocolate should melt in your mouth at approximately 37 
degrees celsius 986 degrees fahrenheit but it should not melt or 
become fluid at outside temperatures at the same level he said 
the development would be a boon to candy distributors who 
cannot deliver chocolate during warm weather without expensive 
refrigerated trucks and it could keep chocolate sales steady 
through the summertime and in hotweather areas 
vollerin said consumers should not notice any difference in 
appearance or taste 
theres no secret ingredient other than some traces of natural 
compounds vollerin said its the way we put them in thats 
the secret 
the process has been patented and licensed to a japanese company 
for marketing in the orient and negotiations are under way for the 
licensing of us and european rights vollerin said 
if all goes well test marketing could begin next year he said 
genevas food technology program also has developed new 
cookiebaking techniques that spare heatsensitive fillings such as 
fresh fruit nuts or chocolate chips he said

soviet scientists toasted their us 
colleagues and then headed home after recording simulated lowyield 
nuclear bomb blasts that both sides said showed cheating on a test 
ban treaty could be detected 
the successful weekend experiments in the nevada desert and 
similar ones last september in the soviet union used delicate 
seismographs to detect minuscule shock waves from the explosions of 
10 and 15ton charges of dynamite a fraction of the strength of 
most nuclear weapons tests from as far as 400 miles away 
the experiments are expected to show that any chances for 
cheating are about excluded under a test ban evgeni velikhov 
vice president of the soviet academy and an adviser to soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev said sunday 
after seismometers detected the first detonation of 10 tons of 
tnt on friday charles archambeau a university of coloradoboulder 
geophysics professor said the experiments mean that we can more 
accurately gauge the numbers and distribution of stations that will 
be required to verify a lowthreshold treaty 
velikhov wearing a sweatshirt that said arms are for hugs 
called a comprehensive test ban very important it is extremely 
important to stop the arms race 
the soviets offered toast with vodka and beer on may day a 
communist holiday 
scientists said they would turn to learning how to determine the 
difference between nuclear weapons detonations and industrial 
explosions by conducting more tests 
archambeau head of the national resources defense councils 
seismic monitoring advisory committee said he hoped both 
governments would sponsor further experiments 
the multimilliondollar experiments in this country and in the 
soviet union were conducted by the council a private group and by 
the soviet academy of sciences 
archambeau and other scientists in the project had been 
concerned that after the success of last years research near the 
soviet test site efforts here might be thwarted by nevadas 
faultriddled geology which soaks up sound waves he said he was 
relieved by the success of saturdays final test 
this is quite a strong signal its highly valuable he said 
after a 15ton explosion 100 miles east of carson city on saturday 
sent seismic needles quivering at the joint ussoviet monitoring 
station in deep springs calif 210 miles away 
on friday 10 tons of tnt were detonated beneath the desert 100 
miles north of reno and another 10ton shot was set off 50 miles 
south of the nevada test site 
they were monitored at the joint station in deep springs midway 
between reno and las vegas and at two permanent defense council 
installations closer to the test site 110 miles north of las vegas 
where all us underground nuclear detonations are conducted one 
hundred forty additional temporary monitoring stations were set up 
across nevada 
fridays first test barely moved the seismometers at deep 
springs and the second was not detected but both showed up on more 
sensitive digital instruments said holly eissler research 
geophysicist at the university of california san diego 
she noted that a limited nuclear test ban treaty passed by the 
house last week forbids detonations larger than one kiloton 100 
times stronger than the 10ton tnt blast 
thomas cochran senior staff scientist for the defense council 
and a codirector of the test ban verification project said the 
council had spent about 35 million on the effort since it began 
two years ago he estimated the us groups share of the weekends 
testing at about 300000

a wintry storm moved into colorado sunday piling snow up to a 
foot deep in and west of the rockies whipping winds to 60 mph and 
triggering a blinding dust storm blamed for two fatal traffic 
pileups 
strong thunderstorms struck parts of florida 
northwestern wyoming got 8 inches of wet snow closing the 
eastern and southern entrances to yellowstone national park in the 
morning south of the park 5 inches of snow was reported in moose 
and jackson where wet snow accumulating on power lines caused some 
blackouts the national weather service said 
up to 14 inches of snow was reported in the mountains and 
foothills of southcentral montana 
snow also was widespread over eastern sections of idaho and 
northern utah parts of eastern idaho got 5 inches of snow 
overnight up to 8 inches of snow was reported at tooele utah 
with 7 inches at the snowbird ski resort and 5 inches at alta 
in eastern colorado 50 mph winds spawned the dust storm which 
dropped visibility to zero and caused the pileups on interstate 70 
near seibert about 45 miles west of the kansas border said peter 
holmstedt of the colorado state patrol two motorists were killed 
and 17 people injured authorities said 
the incidents occurred in east and westbound lanesof i70 
between limon and seibert nearly 45 miles of the highway was 
closed for more than two hours before visibility improved 
high trucks and trailers were banned from interstate 80 at 
wendover utah because of strong gusty wind bryce canyon utah 
reported gusts near 60 mph 
in new mexico winds gusted to 80 mph in ruidoso and 60 mph in 
albuquerque ruidosos sierra blanca regional airport was closed 
the northern and central high plains also had gusty wind with 
gusts to more than 50 mph throughout the dakotas and gusts to 60 
mph in central colorado at gunnison and trinidad 
a day before the difference in pressure between that storm and 
a highpressure front 700 miles off the west coast generated 65 mph 
wind in southern california generating waves that destroyed a 
municipal pier and stranded 1400 tourists on santa catalina island 
whenever winds blow its due to a pressure difference from 
high to low just like water running downhill said bob grebe of 
the weather service 
on sunday the body of a man believed to be a boater who jumped 
from a disabled craft in windtossed seas saturday washed ashore 
near the los angeles suburb of el segundo said los angeles county

when michael dukakis says seven years of 
charisma in the white house was enough george bush would be the 
first to acknowledge its probably not a reference to him 
you dont know how hard its been to keep my own charisma in 
check these past seven years the vice president tells audiences 
tongue in cheek 
on one subject both dukakis the democratic frontrunner and 
bush who locked up the gop presidential nomination earlier this 
week seem to agree both concede they are viewed as bland and 
both insist its fine with them 
bush whats wrong with being a boring sort of guy 
dukakis maybe its time for a little competence 
are bush and dukakis really that boring 
no say the candidates themselves not really both say their 
wives dont think so either 
yes says john sears a political consultant who ran president 
reagans 1976 campaign and the early part of his 1980 race 
its true at the moment theyre both saying theyre managers 
that sounds pretty boring were looking for leaders here he 
said 
in defense of bush sears adds in terms of ones ability to 
compel deep feeling the vice presidency is not an office in which 
you can gain that 
in defense of dukakis bob beckel who was walter mondales 
campaign manager in 1984 says its a good example of a guy who 
understands his limitations and maximizes his assets he didnt try 
to make himself something he wasnt 
neither bush nor dukakis has been able to evoke the kind of 
passionate responses from audiences that say reagan or democratic 
contender jesse jackson do regularly 
the massachusetts governor has been known to scratch jokes out 
of prepared speeches the vice president has a half dozen standard 
jokes he uses regularly but sometimes he muffs the delivery 
both are widely viewed as pragmatists not ideologues 
and when talking about themselves the two men likely to be 
rivals in the fall sound remarkably alike 
people are not looking for a lot of pizazz out there theyre 
looking for someone whos stable whose had some experience a 
record of achievement has values they can identify with 
running for president is serious business 
dukakis no bush 
heres dukakis the fact is after seven years of charisma 
its time for accomplishment and a record 
even when the candidates are insisting they really arent all 
that boring they sound alike 
bush my wife doesnt think that im boring i dont know 
about mrs dukakis what she thinks or mrs jesse jackson i 
think that im a scintillating kind of guy 
dukakis people say im not a passionate guy my wife 
thinks im passionate and so does playgirl magazine the 
publication had put the massachusetts governor on a list of 
bestdressed males 
dukakis also is fond of pointing out that the word charisma 
like himself is of greek ancestry he doesnt usually elaborate 
but the implication is that there must be a little charisma in him 
bush says he doesnt plan to change his image he recently told 
reporters he wont kind of suddenly get my hair colored and dance 
up and down in a miniskirt or do something to show that ive got a 
lot of jazz out there and drop a bunch of oneliners 
william schneider a political analyst with the american 
enterprise institute says both candidates are indeed boring and 
should leave it at that efforts to appear otherwise come off as 
sounding silly schneider suggested 
boring politicians do pretty well in this country he said 
richard nixon was pretty boring jimmy carter was boring lyndon 
johnson seemed boring at least in comparison with barry goldwater 
and we elected reagan with a lot of reservations he was too 
interesting but he was elected because of our desperate desire for 
a change 
with two boring candidates running that personality trait 
should cancel itself out schneider suggested 
but are they equally boring 
between them dukakis is a little more boring schneider 
said 
george bush has more of a tendency to say foolish things in 
that sense hes not boring but the only way for him to make 
himself not boring is by making himself into a joke 
stuart e eizenstat who was carters domestic affairs adviser 
said a presidential candidate with charisma is the exception 
rather than the rule 
in 1976 ford and carter were not exactly accused of being 
charismatic candidates eizenstat said 
however eizenstat said it may be too early to rule out the 
charisma factor entirely 
candidates take on a certain charisma which will come out 
when theyre anointed as nominees of their parties they may not 
have now all the hoopla of national conventions invests people 
with a certain halo effect 
in any event eizenstat said he personally doesnt find either 
bush or dukakis boring dull perhaps but not boring 
i dont because what turns me on are public policy issues and 
people who are interested in discussing them

a supporter of extremist lyndon larouche is 
taking over the nations secondlargest local democratic party but 
concerned party members have stripped the post of most of its power 
and even its office 
claude jones stunned texas harris county by winning election 
march 8 as chairman 
jones who was scheduled to take office today blames his lack 
of clout within the party on democratic elitists who he says 
are more concerned about their status than the party itself 
there are some people in the democratic party that arent 
being very democratic he said 
the groups bylaws were changed by the partys 34member 
steering committee three days after the election when jones 
narrowly defeated incumbent larry veselka 
the unanimous final approval of the bylaw changes came april 15 
by the 664member executive committee made up of precinct 
chairmen jones tried to thwart the vote but a state district 
judge denied his request for a temporary restraining order 
embarrassed democratic party leaders say jones was elected to 
the 2yearold post by accident because of his common name and the 
races obscurity veselka an attorney was unable to campaign in 
the weeks before the election because he was involved in a trial 
outside houston 
jones says he won because he worked hard pushing larouche issues 
that finally hit a nerve 
his election shocked party leaders who face working under a 
chairman associated since 1975 with a perennial presidential 
candidate who claims the queen of england is involved in drug 
trafficking and has called for a quarantine of all aids patients 
jones whom veselka defeated in 1986 said his sole occupation 
is working for larouche he staffs solicitation booths the larouche 
organization sponsors at airports and other public places 
harris county which includes houston trails only illinois 
cook county which includes chicago in size as an election 
district harris county will send more delegates to the democratic 
national convention this summer than 17 states 
when jones assumes his limited duties hell have no office at 
the partys headquarters quarters that veselka used are occupied 
by another staffer said bill ramsey the partys executive 
director 
mr jones will have access to any records he needs he just 
wont be able to come in and tell staffers what to do ramsey 
said 
scott ramsey jones attorney says the new bylaws prohibit his 
client from performing his statutory duties such as recordkeeping 
and handling the partys primary 
but david webb the partys general counsel counters that the 
chairmans duties under the law are to handle the county primary 
which involves accepting applications and certifying the candidates 
under the old rules the chairman raised funds for democratic 
candidates in the district and largely determined how that money 
was spent 
now only the partys secretary and treasurer have access to the 
money 
not very many people are going to give money if claude jones 
is in control bill ramsey said he said jones might not be able 
to deliver the votes or might not want to support a mainstream 
democrat 
jones also will have little power to set priorities for the 
local party 
he will carry the title and preside over the meetings but he 
wont set the agenda he cant stray from the agenda either 
bill ramsey said 
for now jones said he isnt sure of his plans except that he 
wants to bring more people into the democratic party during his 
term his attorney says they havent ruled out a possible return to 
court 
despite the squabbles jones has done one good thing says 
barbara stanley a past county chairwoman he has united the 
democratic party of harris county

democratic party officials in suburban 
philadelphias 5th congressional district are stuck with a 
candidate they dont want a backer of political extremist lyndon 
larouche 
one official said party leaders were focusing on other campaigns 
when larouche backer donald hadley defeated robert w houchins a 
littleknown candidate endorsed by the party in tuesdays 
congressional primary 
hadley a sales representative from drexel hill will face rep 
richard schulze a wellfinanced republican in novembers election 
houchins has blamed his loss on the democratic organization in 
montgomery chester and delaware counties which make up the 
district and on voters whom he accused of ignorance 
charles manson could run for office and get elected he said 
friday 
the county committees did not take larouche seriously the 
area leaders did not take him seriously and the committee people 
did not take him seriously so ultimately the voter didnt take 
the larouche threat seriously 
party leaders agreed 
of course its our partys responsibility and obviously we 
failed said delaware county democratic committee chairwoman 
dianne merlino we should have exercised our maximum effort to 
promote houchins 
on friday montgomery county democratic chairman philip berg 
called for hadley to step down to let a legitimate candidate 
run 
berg said he would rather see schulze win it would be better 
than having a larouchian he said 
larouche a perennial presidential candidate has promoted a 
quarantine of aids victims and the colonization of mars and has 
charged that queen elizabeth ii of england is a drug dealer 
he is on trial in boston with six aides and five of his 
political groups on charges they conspired to obstruct a federal 
grand jury investigation the grand jury was probing allegations 
that more than 1 million was raised for larouches 1984 
presidential campaign through credit card and loan fraud 
in an interview with the delaware county times hadley said he 
openly identified himself with larouche and won the election 
because of voters dissatisfaction with mainstream democratic 
candidates 
but berg and other democrats contend that hadley concealed the 
affiliation 
i dont believe there was anything indicating he was a 
larouchian published by him i think he was more surprised than 
other people that he even won berg said no one could even get 
a hold of him i never saw him i never met him he was never at 
any meetings held by the montgomery county democratic committee i 
never received one phone call from him not one piece of literature 
from him 
hadley said he was in the streets daily talking facetoface 
with people talking about why theyre trying to railroad larouche 
why theyre trying to keep him out of politics 
i told them what weve got to do to get the economy in shape 
thats what people are interested in 
ms merlino said hadley won because he was first on the ballot 
the candidates names were similar and the victor made 
misrepresentations 
i didnt think the problem would be so big that we couldnt 
overcome it in delaware county she said i should have done 
more i should have been more aware 
delaware county was the only one of the three that carried 
houchins overall hadley had 10667 votes or 53 percent and 
houchins had 9298 votes or 47 percent with 99 percent of the 
vote counted 
democrats in the republican stronghold were busy backing 
candidates in other races ms merlino said 
berg and ms merlino said their committees will not back him 
state party chairman larry yatch said he and his aides are studying 
what measures to take in the election 
dana scanlon a spokeswoman for the larouche for president 
campaign said hadley is unlikely to receive much funding but will 
get help from larouche supporters

american indian children educated in schools 
run by the federal government score worse on standardized tests 
than 79 percent of students nationwide a new report says 
the report is the first such compilation of test scores at 
schools run by the bureau of indian affairs an interior department 
official said it was compiled by the bureau itself and has been 
released to tribes and others for comment 
the report blames many shortcomings on a lack of leadership 
sometimes actual lack of leaders as shown by a 33 percent turnover 
rate among principals use of acting directors of the office of 
indian education programs for five out of the past six years and 11 
vacancies on the 40person headquarters staff 
bureaucratic turf battles also contribute to the problems it 
says 
collegiality the act of putting aside vested interests and 
working for the good of the whole is found in americas best 
educational institutions but is often missing in the bia system 
where administrators are sometimes more interested in shoring up 
and expanding their administrative domain the report says 
the 260page document asks tribal leaders school boards and 
others to consider an effective schools strategy including 
steps to hold bia educators more accountable for their students 
performance 
it also suggests expanded authority to waive indian hiring 
preferences and loans to educate prospective teachers that would 
be increasingly forgiven the longer the teachers stayed at work in 
a bureau school 
the report says pressure to hire indian teachers now 41 
percent of the teaching staff means some are poorly trained and 
deficient in the basic reading writing and mathematical skills 
they were expected to teach some of those checked for the study 
had failed state certification tests which all teachers now are 
supposed to pass 
matters of budgets personnel facilities and other 
administrative tasks rather than education itself preoccupy too 
many principals the report added some bia teachers seem to 
begin with the expectation that their students will do poorly 
too many responsible officials in bia education do not seek to lead 
but merely get by from day to day 
the bureau educates 37917 indian students about 10 percen of 
the nations young indians about 30 percent attend boarding 
schools and about 30 percent are in schools run by tribes under 
contract with the bureau 
the best schools barely approach average national scores 
overall the bureaus students ranked in the 21st percentile on 
standardized tests that is they did worse than 79 percent of all 
children taking the test 
only one of the bureaus district offices had a single grade 
above the national median the 50th percentile the 27 
secondgraders of new mexicos northern pueblo district averaged in 
the 52nd percentile 
tribal leaders and school boards have had access to their own 
scores before but the report provides the first opportunity for 
one tribe or area to compare its standing with another said an 
interior department official who discussed the document on 
condition that he not be identified 
the worst scores were recorded in the chinle district of 
arizona where 202 fourthgraders and 154 fifthgraders mostly 
from rural navajo families wound up in the 7th percentile 
the report highlights some success stories but at the same time 
says the positive developments need to be pointed out more 
effectively to other schools and areas 
for instance the dilcon and chuska boarding schools for navajo 
in the fort defiance district use a special curriculum requiring 
students to write something every day their eighthgraders do 
well with dilcons two months ahead of the national average

a numerical error led officials to crown the 
wrong team winner of a state high school math contest but a rival 
suburban chicago school reclaimed the honors after a recount 
officials said 
officials of the illinois council of teachers of mathematics 
state math contest considered the appeal of new trier high schools 
coach and found he was right final score new trier 992 evanston 
township high 979 
a clerk tabulating the scores gave new trier of winnetka only 
three points in one event saturday when it should have received 33 
in the competition at illinois state university 
we regret it was announced that evanston was the firstplace 
winner said thomas shilgalis a contest official 
its really nice to win its gratifying to win but winning 
isnt why you do it said john benson coach of evanstons math 
club its not football 
some evanston students were disappointed 
we all started cheering and jumping up and down senior 
catherine epp said sunday we were in first place for the first 
time which was really fantastic 
still epp the individual winner in the geometry event said 
i think that having fun and learning good math is a lot more 
important than whether we win state 
saturdays win brought new trier its eighth consecutive crown in 
the contest and also pitted two schools whose rivalry is fierce 
in the classroom and the playing field 
rhoad called this years event the battle of the giants 
because evanston and new trier placed high in a national written 
math contest in march of the 14000 schools entered evanston 
placed first a canadian school placed second and new trier was 
third 
at the weekend contest here students competed in 13 events 
including a relay in which each member of a fourstudent team 
worked on onefourth of the problem

jesse jackson gazed from a balcony over the 
sunny riverfront lawn party where a welldressed crowd sipped wine 
no one ever told us it was going to be easy jackson shouted 
to the 300 partygoers 
but the candidate wanted his predominately black audience to 
remember something when you consider what we came from we dont 
have the ability to get tired 
this is not just iowa to atlanta this is from the back of the 
bus in montgomery to being within one of three to being the next 
president 
it is a theme that has become increasingly prominent for jackson 
in recent days after his heavy losses in the pennsylvania and new 
york primaries 
he is sounding a twofold message as he trails massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis down the home stretch of the primary season 
first he vows to fight on to win the nomination and raise 
issues but second jackson highlights the historic aspect of his 
candidacy casting it in terms that spell victory whether he wins 
or loses the nomination 
in the face of a new poll showing dukakis with a 40point lead 
in ohio whose primary is tuesday jackson appeared to be dwelling 
increasingly on this over the weekend 
by pointing to his unquestioned successes and the wide 
acceptance his candidacy has received jackson paints his effort as 
an outgrowth of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and another 
step on the road to full equality for blacks 
he contrasts his bid for the white house with the grim days more 
than two decades ago when people died fighting for just the right 
to vote 
so as he campaigns across ohio he tells church crowds and 
rallies that his candidacy is far more than a journey from the iowa 
caucuses in february to this summers democratic convention in 
atlanta 
its a journey that began when blacks began rebelling in 
montgomery ala against being forced to ride in the back of the 
bus he said 
and its a mission that must be carried forward by people like 
the wellheeled crowd at the estate of physician alfred jefferson 
in this columbus suburb he told them 
he said reporters are asking him after his string of losses 
how can you go on 
jacksons answer do you know how far weve come were 
almost to the top of the hill weve come too far we must press 
forward 
the crowd laughed with acknowledgement when he pointed to the 
strides they have made financially saying most of us standing 
here today are one generation out of chitlins 
to dramatize his point jackson related as he often does the 
story of his humble south carolina beginnings born to a teenage 
mother and the married man next door living in a house with 
wallpaper for warmth not decoration waiting to eat thanksgiving 
dinner until his mother came home with leftovers from the table of 
the white people whose meal she had prepared 
jackson sometimes seems amazed himself as he tells the story 
when i win there are no more impossible dreams he often 
says 
but in keeping with his portrayal of his candidacy as part of a 
historical continuum he told his dublin audience that he expects 
them to carry on the movement he said they must translate this 
movement into demands for blacks in positions of authority at 
banks and universities and corporations where there are still 
barriers as well as in government 
when i shake apples from the tree you must pick up these 
apples and make them into jelly and take them to the market he 
said 
to have continuity in our struggle we must establish a 
heritage of success in the government for all coming generations

the soviet unions grain production target for 
1988 is unrealistic despite moscows wellpublicized intensive 
technology program to boost agricultural output according to an 
agriculture department analyst 
christian j foster of the departments economic research 
service said this years soviet target is 235 million metric tons 
including wheat corn and other grains 
this total is unrealistic even though it is only 2 million 
tons above the 1987 goal foster said soviet plans continue to 
call for unlikely grain output goals of 250 million to 255 million 
tons by 1990 and 260 million to 280 million by 1995 
a major part of soviet strategy is the intensive technology 
program which means greater use of betterquality fertilizers 
pesticides seed and farm equipment it also means use of these 
production items should be concentrated on the best soils 
foster said that in 1986 almost 73 percent of the area planted 
to wheat and other small grains was fertilized a record the 
application rate per hectare 247 acres was up 20 percent from 
1985 and nearly 70 percent from 1980 
moreover the fertilizers which have often benefited mainly 
weeds have been increasingly supplemented by herbicides and other 
plant protection agents ppas he said in the may issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine to compensate for lower quality 
domestically produced ppas emphasis has been placed on imports of 
more potent chemicals from the west 
by 1990 moscow plans to use intensive technology on as much as 
50 million hectares despite the fact that constraints to 
broadening the program are already appearing in its slowing rate of 
expansion foster said 
the area for intensive technology rose about 10 million hectares 
in 1986 from less than 19 million hectares in 1985 he said but 
the increase slowed to about 6 million hectares in 1987 and is 
planned to increase only 4 million in 1988 
furthermore the additional grain production from intensive 
technology in 1987 was a reported 25 million tons only 1 million 
more than in 1986 foster said this is in spite of a reported 
20 percent increase from 1986 in the area under the program 
last years soviet grain output was 2113 million tons up only 
1 percent from 1986 but foster noted that it was the first time 
ever that two consecutive grain crops of more than 200 million tons 
had been harvested 
bad weather hurt the quality of 1987 grain although the average 
yield of 183 tons per hectare was second only to the record 185 
tons harvested in 1978 a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
foster said the 1988 winter grain crop which includes winter 
wheat rye and barley was planted under favorable conditions last 
fall and is thought to have suffered belowaverage winterkill 
a concern of soviet farmers in the new lands this spring is 
the lack of highquality seed for spring grain he said the 
quality of seed stocks was below average in the areas with 
harvesting problems last year the urals region the volga region 
northern kazakhstan west siberia and the nonblack soil zone 
a chronic problem for soviet planners partly related to 
climate and geography is the production of milling wheat the 
highquality grain desired for bread pasta and other food products 
their problems persist despite plans calling for 
selfsufficiency in food grains and despite wheat production twice 
the size of food needs foster said 
as a result the soviet union has looked to foreign sources for 
highquality wheat to augment its own vast harvests of lower 
quality grain the united states particularly since subsidized

gunther herbig said he planned to resign as 
conductor of the detroit symphony orchestra because of numerous 
violations of his contract a newspaper reported today 
herbig the orchestras conductor since 1984 told musicians 
about his plans during intermission of saturday nights concert on 
sunday he declined to discuss his resignation effective when his 
contract expires in 1990 the detroit news said 
several musicians told newspaper that herbig cited several 
complaints many of them related to the orchestras financial 
troubles 
among herbigs complaints they said were cancellation of a 
198990 tour of the far east refusal to guarantee frequent 
domestic tours reduction of the number of guaranteed musicians 
from 103 to 97 and refusal to promise the orchestra will move in 
198990 from ford auditorium to orchestra hall 
herbig told us that virtually the only thing they honored in 
the contract was payment and that even that was sometimes late 
said maxim janowsky a dso bassist 
orchestra board chairman walter j mccarthy jr said in a 
statement sunday that the orchestras financial troubles caused the 
board to fail to meet some terms of herbigs contract 
but it was the boards intention and hope to honor maestro 
herbigs contract in every detail the statement said 
herbig said he would complete a second threeyear term under a 
contract he signed in 1987 leaving 28 months to work with 
management in finding a replacement 
the orchestra in november while musicians were in the midst of 
a 12week work stoppage announced a deficit of 14 million for 
the 198687 season raising its cumulative deficit to 41 million 
against an annual budget of 14 million 
a deficit reduction campaign has been launched but the news 
citing an unidentified source close to the orchestra said 
musicians were told last week an additional deficit of 400000 was 
anticipated for this season

the 75yearold president of the cook county 
board denied allegations he traded patronage jobs for sexual 
favors saying he was guilty of nothing more than poor judgment and 
having sex that hurt no one 
george dunne who is also chairman of the powerful county 
democratic party read a short statement at a news conference 
sunday then got into a shouting match with a reporter went to his 
office and locked the door 
in his statement dunne called the allegations repulsive and 
said they were an attempt to smear a reputation built in 35 years 
in public office 
he said the allegations raised by the better government 
association a private watchdog group and chicago television 
station wmaq wrongfully portray me as some sort of perverted old 
man 
the association contends that dunne engaged in threeway sex and 
strip poker with various pairs of four lesbian women at his farm 
near hebron between 1980 the year his wife died and 1986 
while dunne acknowledges having sex with two women he later 
hired he said his actions were not sordid filthy or illegal 
in his latest denial of the accusations dunne said he was 
guilty of nothing except extremely poor judgment and having 
relationships with the opposite sex which hurt no one 
dunne president of the countys governing board for 19 years 
rejected the associations call that he resign 
there is nothing that i have done over those years that has 
violated the public trust in me he said 
he refused to say whether it was appropriate to hire women after 
having sex with them and told a wmaq reporter who repeatedly asked 
that question youre the scum of the earth and so is the bga 
bga executive director j terrence brunner has admitted that 
as far as we know dunne did not make sex a condition for 
hiring the women 
within two weeks in two instances the people are on the 
public payroll brunner said sunday to me thats an obvious 
link theres no doubt about it 
three of the women dunne allegedly had sex with are on the cook 
county payroll and one used to be the chicago tribune reported 
sunday 
the bga says one of the women who had sex with dunne has been an 
officer with the county forest preserve police since 1984 and 
another was hired by the preserve as a laborer in 1980 
don rose a former political aide to mayors harold washington 
and jane byrne said he doubts dunne broke any laws 
its clear that he simply used his immense hiring powers 
in effect to pass out favors to friends rose said thats not 
illegal but it is exemplary of really terrible abuse of the 
patronage system 
this is the kind of scandal that has brought down 
governments he said however chicago being what it is you 
find more people on the street commenting on his virility at age 75 
than whether or not this was a heinous act

beijing university survivor of invasions 
repression and political warfare commemorates on wednesday its 
90th anniversary as chinas foremost center of learning 
the celebrations have been pegged not to the colleges founding 
date in 1898 but to a famous uprising on may 4 1919 that vaulted 
beijing university students into the vanguard of chinas 
revolutionary and nationalist movements 
the university marks its birthday with symposiums on its great 
thinkers publication of books chronicling the universitys role in 
shaping modern china sports competition and disco and folk dancing 
but as it enters its 10th decade beida as it is known in its 
abbreviated chinese form faces yet another crisis a lack of money 
that educators claim could seriously erode its standards of 
excellence 
we have many problems said huang huaicheng director of the 
presidents office facilities are quite backward and need to be 
renovated students live six to a room there are not enough 
classrooms and the library is inadequate we cant even buy all the 
books we need 
huang said the school last year had to cut corners to make up a 
13 million gap between planned spending and funds of 81 million 
from the government and other sources 
he said theres no money left to boost pay for instructors who 
start out at less than 30 a month about the same as an unskilled 
laborer and seldom make more than 55 
most of chinas 1000 universities share the same financial 
plight the government acknowledging that education has been 
neglected in the past is spending more but must give priority to 
lower education in a nation still 20 percent illiterate 
the government now is encouraging teachers to help out colleges 
and bolster their meager incomes by moonlighting universities are 
being told to make money by selling basic services and technology 
beida students and faculty living up to their activist 
traditions have been the first to question the wisdom of this 
policy students with shoeshine kits appeared on beijings central 
tiananmen square to show what they thought of sideline jobs 
open letters to members of chinas parliament and bigcharacter 
posters on the campus recently spoke of the crisis engendered 
by the governments investing in industrial development rather than 
its human resources 
beida students have a tradition of being concerned about the 
future of the country huang said 
university president ding shisin defended the protestors and 
complained to chinese journalists that some department heads at the 
university didnt even have their own offices 
beijing university began in 1898 as the peking imperial 
university it was founded during the qing dynastys 100day 
reform a shortlived effort to introduce some western ideas in 
government and education 
for its first two decades the schools main role was to turn 
out government functionaries and among its less kind nicknames 
were the gambling den and fountainhead of ribaldry and 
bawdiness 
that changed in 1916 when cai yuanpei a classical scholar who 
had studied in europe became president cai introduced western 
scholarship and coed education and brought in educators such as 
chen duxiu one of the fathers of chinese leftism and hu shi who 
studied under american pragmatist john dewey and led the movement 
to use the vernacular language in chinese literature 
one of chinas first marxists li dazhao was librarian and then 
professor at beida among his library assistants was mao tsetung 
beida and other beijing universities moved to the southwest 
china city of kunming after japanese troops invaded the capital in 
1937 returning only in 1946 after world war ii ended 
three years later mao came to power in beijing bringing with 
him strong antiintellectual biases 
in 1957 when mao encouraged critics to speak out with the 
slogan let a hundred flowers bloom let a hundred schools of 
thought contend beida teachers declared that the masses want 
to overthrow the communist party they were among the first to be 
purged in a subsequent crackdown 
ma yinzhu an americaneducated economist was replaced as 
president in 1960 and disappeared shortly after knocking government 
policies in a magazine article where he said it is not enough to 
destroy one must build 
the first clashes of the disastrous cultural revolution began at 
beida in 1966 when nie yuanzi a woman in the philosophy department 
backed by maos wife jiang qing leveled attacks on university 
president lu ping 
in the next few years hundreds on the campus were detained 
driven to suicide or murdered in armed battles between rival 
radical factions 
for a decade almost all classes were suspended and no degrees 
were given the cultural revolution brought overall destruction 
to the university huang said 
he said entrance exams were revived in 1977 the school now 
accepts about one out of five examinees it has offered degrees 
since 1981 
the school now has 20000 students including postgraduates and 
special students with a freshman class of about 2000 since its 
merger in 1952 with yanjing university a former american 
missionary college it has occupied 500 acres of wooded land in 
northwest beijing 
qing dynastystyle buildings with red pillars and slanted tiled 
roofs and surrounded by bamboo groves and lakes are one throwback 
to the yanjing period 
one fixture that will be missing at 90th anniversary 
celebrations will be a giant statue of mao torn down late one 
night in april by university workmen teachers who helped build the 
monolith during the early days of the cultural revolution applauded 
its removal saying it was one reminder of the past they could live 
without

ballots without the names of specific 
candidates will be available for the first time to an estimated 3 
million americans in other countries who are eligible to vote on 
nov 8 for the next president 
the new fillintheblank ballots are for people who may not be 
able to get a regular absentee ballot submitted in time from a 
remote mission in africa for example or a submarine at sea for 
months but mostly they are for the victims of slow mail deliveries 
henry valentino head of the federal voting assistance program 
office said a million of these writein ballots will be sent in 
july to all us embassies and consulates and to the voting 
officers attached to each military unit overseas the object is to 
increase the number of americans who vote even if they are 
working traveling or living abroad 
canada and mexico have the largest number of such civilians the 
biggest numbers of military are in west germany japan and south 
korea 
valentino estimates that in the 1984 election about 55 percent 
of the overseas military and 35 percent of civilians cast ballots 
for civilians that was much lower than the national average of 
531 percent 
he also estimates on the basis of polls that 85 percent 
roughly 250000 tried to vote but failed to get in a regular 
absentee ballot and have it counted by voting authorities at home 
there were many causes including failure to write the proper 
office in time failure of local authorities to mail the ballot in 
time failure of the voter to mail it back or failure of local 
deliveries abroad 
absentee ballots that arrive too late are not counted 
we just got a court order monday to make election officials in 
pennsylvania count absentee ballots received up to 10 days after 
the april 26 primary valentino said in an interview 
most pennsylvania election officials began mailing their 
absentee ballots only two weeks before the election 
one reason for slow mailing by local authorities is that they 
have to wait until candidates are named before they can start 
printing 
the blank absentee ballots will be usable only for federal 
positions in the general election on nov 8 the voter must first 
write for a regular absentee ballot from his or her district at 
home getting the application in at least 30 days before election 
day 
if the absentee ballot does not reach the voter in time he or 
she can write in the name of a choice for president for senator if 
there is a senatorial election in the state and for a member of the 
house of representatives 
the names of political parties can be written instead and such 
tickets may be split 
you can write the name of one party as your choice for 
president and another party for the senator if you dont write 
individual names valentino explained 
state authorities will have to count the writein ballot as they 
do regular absentee ballots 
the writeins are not to be used or distributed within the 
united states including puerto rico guam the virgin islands and 
american samoa but they will be sent to units deploying to 
overseas assignments and to ships and submarines expected to be at 
sea on election day

special interest groups have supplied 53 
million to congressional candidates in the last 15 months with the 
chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee making the 
biggest haul 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who faces a challenge this fall 
from republican rep beau boulter led the list of recipients of 
political action committee money with 14 million 
bentsen also ranked as the largest overall fundraiser among 
candidates so far with just over 5 million by march 31 compared 
with boulters 365000 
the figures were released sunday by the federal election 
commission which said congressional candidates raised 180 million 
overall in the first 15 months of the twoyear cycle that 
culminates with novembers elections 
of that it said 53 million or 29 percent came from the 
specialinterest groups known as pacs 
at the comparable time in 1986 house and senate contenders had 
raised 167 million of which 41 million was in pac money a 24 
percent share 
the growing clout of special interests in congressional 
elections has prompted senate critics to seek voluntary restraints 
on the amount of such money that can be spent by senate candidates 
the democratic push has been stymied by republican filibusters 
overall the 143 candidates for senate seats raised 79 million 
during the 15month period about 1 million less than at the 
comparable time two years ago the decrease was due in part to a 
smaller number of candidates than in 1986 
the 1201 candidates for house seats had pulled in 101 million 
as of march 31 a 14 million increase the jump came in part 
because 17 more incumbents are seeking reelection than two years 
ago 
aside from texas senate races in two other populous states 
california and ohio also ranked high on the money lists 
sen pete wilson rcalif ranked second behind bentsen in 
overall fund raising with more than 4 million collected toward 
his contest with challenger leo t mccarthy the democratic 
california lieutenant governor mccarthys receipts totaled 24 
million 
in ohio incumbent sen howard metzenbaum ranked third in fund 
raising at 37 million while his opponent republican cleveland 
mayor george voinovich had raised 25 million 
among house races the leader was rep joseph dioguardi rny 
who is trying to hold onto the traditionally democratic seat he has 
held for two terms he raised 800000 during the first 15 months 
of the election season 
close behind were reps mel levine dcalif with 750000 and 
joseph kennedy dmass with 706000 
top recipients of pac money among house members were budget 
committee chairman william gray dpa with 267000 and mary 
rose oakar dohio with 257000 also ranking high on that list 
was energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell dmich 
with nearly 257000 in specialinterest money

legislation to control urban air pollution and 
acid rain has been stalled in congress but there are stirrings in 
the house trenches and talk of an offensive in the senate 
factions in the house energy and commerce committee are finally 
exchanging proposals in quiet negotiations that started only after 
nine renegade democrats led by rep al swift dwash politely 
grabbed the reins from warring chairmen 
in the senate george mitchell dmaine is openly threatening a 
parliamentary endrun around majority leader robert byrd dwva 
an acidrain control foe who has refused floor time to the mitchell 
clean air bill that has been ready for debate since last september 
and on both sides of the capitol a new phrase has entered the 
vocabulary of lawmakers and environmental lobbyists trying to break 
the clean air logjam michael dukakis 
their message is clear the clean air act will be strengthened 
possibly with the white house occupied by a man perceived to have a 
stronger environmental commitment than ronald reagan or george bush 
mitchells name is creeping into this scenario he is a 
candidate to succeed byrd next year when the west virginian steps 
down from the senates most powerful post 
hopefully those whove tried to stop any legislation will 
look at a new majority leader in the senate and the possibility of 
a democratic administration in the white house and see that this is 
the year to work out acid rain says rep henry waxman dcalif 
the environmentalists point man in the house 
time is running short congress which will take time off for 
the national political conventions and its own reelection 
campaigns has set an aug 31 deadline for action 
that is the stopgap date set last december as the clean air 
acts deadline for metropolitan areas to meet standards for maximum 
levels of ozone and carbon monoxide or risk sanctions like a ban on 
construction of new pollution sources 
more than 60 areas are not expected to attain the standards the 
debate in congress is over how much more time they should be given 
to reduce air pollution and what steps they must take to comply 
with the healthbased standards 
the biggest apparent stumbling block on the house side is 
whether to force automakers to produce vehicles with cleaner 
emissions and install equipment to capture polluting gasoline fumes 
during refueling 
these are not pleasant questions for the powerful energy and 
commerce chairman john dingell dmich who comes from an 
automaking district 
the acid rain component of the clean air struggle is far more 
complicated for lawmakers trying to combat coalburning plant 
emissions that produce the fallout some scientists say poses human 
health risks and harms lakes coastal waters and building facades 
byrd illustrates part of the complications west virginia not 
only has power plants that would need improvements under the 
mitchell bill but also a highsulfur coal industry in the northern 
part of the state it could be hurt if power plants switch to 
cleaner fuel like natural gas to meet the bills requirements 
most of the utilities that would be affected by an acid rain 
bill are in the midwest lawmakers from that area dont want to see 
their constituents electricity bills run up by expensive 
smokestack scrubbers to clean up emissions 
western lawmakers like the idea of being able to sell their 
lowsulfur coal to the midwest but many dont like waxmans idea 
of a surtax on electric bills nationwide to soften the blow on 
midwestern ratepayers 
the power companies like the reagan administration dont want 
any acid rain legislation at all these foes argue that scientists 
are divided over the effects of acid deposition and that the nation 
should await the arrival of cleancoal technology being sought 
under a 25 billion research program 
southerners are not bystanders acid rain problems have shown up 
from florida to texas northeasterners downwind from midwestern 
utilities want action as does the environmental lobby 
mitchell says he has been negotiating with colleagues including 
byrd to get his bill to the floor he said in an interview last 
week that supporters will take direct action if the leadership 
doesnt call the bill up for debate 
clearly there will be an effort to tack it on to something 
else as an amendment said mitchell one of 48 senators who have 
written byrd asking for floor time 
tina evans a byrd spokeswoman says the majority leader has 
no plans to call up an acid rain bill she quoted byrd as saying 
any senator may at any time call up an amendment to any bill i 
would not be surprised if this is tried with acid rain 
meanwhile the clock is ticking toward aug 31 with some 
supporters of tougher air pollution control laws vowing to oppose 
another deadline extension 
this really is a race with the clock says swift adding 
that his socalled group of nine hopes to have its own acid rain 
plan drafted in two weeks in an effort to get movement on this 
issue in energy and commerce 
waxman cosponsor of a tough acid rain bill with rep gerry 
sikorski dminn says he soon may call his health subcommittee 
back to the table to try to win approval of a clean air package and 
throw the issue to dingells full committee 
waxman suspended billwriting efforts nearly two months ago his 
panel still evenly split over the acid rain control question

four months after he completed a 
25year prison term modesto napoleon ortigoza has yet to taste 
freedom 
the former army captain was convicted of killing a cadet in 1962 
who allegedly learned of his involvement in a plot to overthrow 
president alfredo stroessner the western hemispheres 
longestreigning leader 
ortigoza 56 said in an interview in march that he was never 
allowed to appear in court to plead his innocence and that his 
confession was extracted by torture including electric shocks on a 
grill 
when you are defenseless under the torturers 10 in my case 
you give in and say what they want you to ortigoza told the ap 
ortigoza was released from prison on dec 20 but was put under 
police custody in the town of san estanislao 85 miles northeast of 
asuncion 
he was brought to asuncion in february where two 
roundtheclock guards prevented him from leaving the home of his 
invalid mother the government said without elaboration that the 
guards were protecting ortigoza 
he escaped march 25 with the help of an opposition leader both 
fled one block to the residence of colombian ambassador vicente 
martinez emiliani 
colombia granted both political asylum but the paraguayan 
government has refused to act on colombias request for 
safeconduct passage out of the country for ortigoza and the 
dissident hermes rafael saguier emiliani recently said he has had 
no news on the pending requests for safe passage 
interior minister sabino montanaro says his country is in no 
rush to grant ortigoza safe passage calling him a common 
criminal 
government officials have branded saguier 40 a subversive and 
compared ortigozas escape to the embassy a terrorist action 
foreign minister carlos augusto saldivar declined to say when 
the government would respond to ortigozas request for safe passage 
it looks like it will be one of those things that will go on 
and on and on indefinitely said a european diplomatic who has 
followed the situation closely the diplomat spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
neither ortigoza nor saguier are allowed to speak to reporters 
or to leave the ambassadors residence their lawyers family and 
close friends are the only ones permitted to visit 
paraguays human rights commission says ortigozas treatment is 
meant to be a lesson to those who would conspire against 
stroessner in power since 1954 
ortigozas lawyer digno britez says the may 1618 visit to 
paraguay by pope john paul ii and stroessners trip to the united 
nations in june could help ortigoza and saguier gain safe passage 
out of paraguay 
stroessner would not want something like that to be brought up 
while he visits the united nations britez said adding our 
government is not a democracy so the consequences were pretty 
predictable from the start

some wondered what it would be like if 
opec leaders met during ramadan the traditional moslem month of 
fasting that began april 18 now we have the answer grueling 
because some of the 13 delegations are mainly or exclusively 
christian part of the cartels oil negotiations took place during 
the day thats the normal time for opec business 
but because the moslem members prefer to slow down during their 
sunrisetosunset fast the formal opec sessions started late at 
night after the moslems had eaten their breakfast 
as a result some of the oil debate was in progress almost 
around the clock 
the nonmoslem oil ministers found it hard to cope with the 
schedule which forced them to try to sleep part of the day 
one said he was taking pills to stay awake during the nighttime 
sessions 
some said they felt as though they had been hit with jet lag 
minus the travel

often its hard to understand why opec leaders have so much 
trouble settling their differences over oil policy 
once in a while its easy consider a comment by ali khalifa

i usually am very reasonable and willing to discuss anything 
once our point of view has been accepted 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
another clue to why opecs meetings often last longer than would 
seem necessary 
we know that some delegates like to be out of our respective 
countries said an official from an african opec member a 
weekend in europe not bad 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its getting harder to classify the players in the international 
oil game 
time was and not long ago you had two types those in opec and 
those outside it 
at the latest opec conference the distinctions were a little 
less clear 
you had the usual 13 opec members but you also had something 
called nonopec an unofficial association of six independent 
oilproducing nations including mexico and china that wants to 
establish formal ties to the cartel without becoming members 
then you had three other oil producers norway the canadian 
province of alberta and the state of texas who wanted to rub 
elbows with the opec leaders but still keep enough distance to 
stand outside the nonopec camp 
some called these three near nonopec 
and then there are the rest producers such as the soviet union 
and britain that want to have nothing to do with the cartel

arguments today then be charged by us district judge william 
dwyer before beginning its deliberations 
if convicted mrs nickell could be sentenced to life in prison 
she is accused of five instances of tampering with 
overthecounter medicine including the two cases involving death 
she has denied any involvement in the deaths 
according to prosecutors mrs nickell unhappy in her marriage 
and frustrated by more than 8500 in debts plotted the june 1986 
death of bruce nickell 52 to collect 176000 in life insurance 
benefits they also said she placed other tainted painrelievers on 
the shelves of area drugstores to make the poisoning appear random 
sue katherine snow 40 of auburn died two weeks after nickell 
she swallowed poisoned excedrin capsules authorities said the 
nickells apparently didnt know ms snow 
in sometimes tearful testimony wednesday and thursday mrs 
nickell denied killing her husband of 12 years or knowing he had 
more than 25000 in life insurance

plants including some containing cyanide to protect children from 
dangerous foliage on their rural property

who she had talked about reaping close to 200 grand in life 
insurance benefits 
mrs nickell admitted that in the spring of 1986 she and her 
sporadicallyemployed husband owed more than 8500 
but she insisted there was nothing macabre about the letters she 
wrote to one bank shortly before nickells death indicating that 
her marriage problems were almost over and that payments would 
stay current 
a prosecution rebuttal witness katherine parker of tacoma 
concluded testimony in the trial thursday she said that ms 
hamilton her former roommate had told her that mrs nickell 
talked of getting rid of her husband and asked how much cocaine it 
would take to kill a person

the apparent suicide of rep roy p dysons top 
aide sent shock waves through marylands political community but 
fellow democrats predicted the congressman would be reelected to a 
fifth term 
i dont think this reflects on roy dyson at this point i 
would say it has no impact on the election said rep benjamin 
cardin a democrat who represents marylands 3rd congressional 
district 
the aide tom pappas 46 of accokeek was being investigated by 
the federal election commission over allegations that the 
39yearold dysons campaign disclosure reports concealed 6650 in 
payments to pappas 
pappas died sunday the day the washington post published a 
story that described former aides accounts of unorthodox job 
demands pappas made on young male congressional staffers and 
allegations that dyson had ceded control of his washington office 
to pappas 
i think the only thing i have to say is its a real tragedy 
that anybody gets to the place where they feel the alternative is 
to take their life said rep steny hoyer of the 5th district 
all the reports indicate apparently mr pappas apparently did 
some things that one would speculate from his actions that he felt 
were very wrong hoyer said 
none of the reports ive heard have indicated mr dyson is 
himself involved if that is the case i would see no reason that 
he wouldnt be reelected as he was in the past said hoyer who 
has known dyson about 15 years 
eastern shore republicans who are seeking to regain control of 
the seat also were shocked 
i find it very difficult to be critical of mr pappas at this 
point said dysons gop opponent in the november election wayne 
gilchrest being critical at this point is not necessary 
he said the allegations in the post story would have no effect 
on the type of campaign he ran 
regardless of what happens in the dyson camp i have a certain 
point of view i want to get across and it doesnt change my 
campaign

after years of being considered the little 
sibling of broadcast television some say the cable tv industry is 
beginning to look more like goliath than david 
cable tv now watched by more than 50 percent of all american 
households has become a 12 billion industry that is gaining 
viewers steadily mostly at the expense of the broadcast networks 
but with prosperity comes increased scrutiny and in cables 
case congress has been raising questions about concentration of 
ownership within the industry complaints of poor service and 
rising rates some in congress say it may be time to reregulate 
cable tv 
we have to pay attention to this james p mooney president 
of the national cable television association told an audience at 
the opening session of the groups annual convention sunday 
we cant rebuff our friends he said an important part of 
good business is good politics 
more than 13000 people are expected to attend the convention 
which runs through tuesday 
most governmental regulation has been lifted from the industry 
the most recent deregulation came in january 1987 when most cable 
systems were freed of municipal rate control they now have more 
control than ever on what viewers see and how much they pay 
deregulation brought increases in rates the industry says the 
average subscribers bill rose 67 percent in the first six months 
after price control was lifted but critics in congress cite 
instances of rates going up by as much as 400 percent in some 
systems 
despite the increase subscribers continued to sign on cable 
systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987 putting the 
percentage of households receiving cable to nearly 52 percent 
about 45 million households 
now that many cable companies have finished building their 
systems wiring more than 80 percent of the nations households 
cable companies are starting to pay off their debt and are putting 
their cash into programming 
programming is going to drive penetration said james s 
cownie president of heritage communications of des moines iowa 
and ncta chairman 
thats going to move us up to the 70 percent saturation level 
from 52 percent where we are now 
the industry has been encouraged by the success of its early 
efforts like showtimes its garry shandlings show a comedy 
series now on fox broadcasting co 
the show is one of only a few that have moved from cable to 
broadcast most of the migration is still from broadcast to cable 
which has become home to many an old syndicated rerun 
but cable executives say that will change as cable systems pour 
more money into developing their own programs 
we should be more concerned with what the content will be than 
where it comes from said michael s fuchs chairman of home box 
office 
hbo received praise for its recent program dear america 
letters home from vietnam 
cable tv particularly the entertainment and sports programming 
network espn also has been landing some big sports contracts 
exclusive cable contracts for big sports events though have been 
criticized for denying viewing of these games to those who dont 
subscribe to cable before cable came along these games could be 
seen free on broadcast tv 
but cable is likely to continue its foray into sports 
programming 
there are more first run movies and sports on cable and 
thats going to continue said fuchs the only things that will 
get some protection from cableexclusive contracts are big sports 
events like the superbowl

coalingas downtown business district 
devastated five years ago by one of californias strongest 
earthquakes this century is still struggling to recover 
in one terrifying moment the towns turnofthecentury stores 
buckled under the force of the quake 
the 67magnitude temblor on may 2 1983 dealt its heaviest 
toll to two blocks that held most of the communitys retail stores 
all had to be razed 
today on the same land modern onestory block buildings house 
the merchants who hung on during the hard times after the quake in 
the town of 8000 residents about 200 miles southeast of san 
francisco 
but vacant lots also mark much of downtown raising concern that 
there are too few shops left to attract enough customers to be 
profitable 
if there were other businesses things would be working 
tremendously there are too many empty lots said marjorie kerr 
who moved all the clothes from her dress shop to her lessdamaged 
home after the earthquake until she could get back in business 
first in a gymnasium then a house trailer and now in the 
rejuvenated downtown 
downtown businesses now include two dress shops two banks two 
drug stores a furniture store a combination bicyclecomputer shop 
and a sears mail order store other downtown offices house a weekly 
newspaper a lawyer accountant and real estate agent 
there are no coffee shops so people dont come downtown as 
much said mrs kerr we need more retail in these two blocks 
not offices 
the city government which aggressively secured a variety of 
financing to recover from the quake owns the rebuilt stores and is 
trying to find more financing and more businesses to fill the empty 
lots 
the city subsidizes rents charging about 34 cents a square 
foot said glen adams a councilman and chamber of commerce 
director thats a sharp increase from the 1020 cents per square 
foot merchants paid for space in the structures wiped out by the 
quake 
those increases make survival difficult for store owners who 
were just making it under the old rents mrs kerr said the owners 
of a jewelry store decided to retire after the earthquake a 
television store closed and one business owner died of stress while 
struggling to keep going in a house trailer 
not all merchants have been hurt however the operators of 
service pharmacy owned their building and it was fully insured 
enabling them to rebuild large enough for their needs and allow 
space to rent out offices 
sales taxes which indicate how much retail business a community 
is doing havent climbed back to the level before the earthquake 
which left 47 injured and caused an estimated 31 million in 
damage said alan jacobsen the public works director 
but 2873 building permits were issued in the five years since 
for 41 million worth of new construction or rehabilitation he 
said 
thats about one permit per building in town jacobsen said 
there has been a net gain of 384 dwellings in coalinga since the 
earthquake allowing the population to increase from 7000 to 
8000 jacobsen said 
the city also has a new natural gas system new sewer lines a 
new fire station bus terminal day care center senior citizens 
center fitness center and community swimming pool 
despite the personal and financial trauma jacobsen feels the 
earthquake was a real positive thing in making us clean up some 
problems we had in buildings safety and that type of thing 
the quake was one of californias 10 strongest quakes this 
century 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred 
before the richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on 
the richter scale

when the house started groaning and the 
studs started popping bill pivnick knew it was time to start 
running a sinkhole was about to swallow his home 
i knew what it was as soon as it occurred and i knew how 
dangerous it could be he said sunday i was afraid the walls 
were going to come tumbling down and ceiling was going to 
collapse 
besides scaring pivnick and his neighbors the sinkhole that 
opened up in a quiet middleclass development near here friday 
surprised geologists with its size and location 
i call this a double freak sinkhole because its so far south 
and its so big william wilson a geologist with the florida 
sinkhole research institute at the university of central florida 
said saturday after examining the depression 
the sinkhole 20 feet deep and more than 200 feet wide is one 
of floridas largest wilson said at least one whole acre has 
been swallowed up in one big gulp he said 
neighbors rushed to sebring ridge on friday evening to pack up 
the possessions of people evacuated from the two houses consumed by 
the sinkhole during the weekend as the water table began to 
transform the sinkhole into a pond neighbors started talked of 
moving pivnick said 
in a couple of weeks everybodys going to forget about the big 
sinkhole in sebring except the neighbors theyll still be living 
on the edge said pivnick a psychologist for the avon park 
correctional institution 
although police fearing the house might plunge deeper forbade 
pivnick and a visiting friend from collecting any of their 
belongings residents who were allowed to return have been generous 
and upbeat 
ive had like eight people offer to give me a place to stay 
gratis pivnick said ive talked to my adjusters and they seem 
to be very agreeable to helping me but i had a friend visiting and 
none of her stuff was covered 
pivnick 40 said his insurance will cover almost all the 
contents of his 70000 threebedroom singlestory home 
the loss is kind of settling in now pivnick said im 
thinking about where im going to be living in three months 
around dinner time friday when the house was groaning the 
studs were popping and the ground in the yard started to shift 
pivnick said they could only run out and warn neighbors 
then the people of sebring came in ive never seen 
anything like it they arrived in pickups and packed up neighbor 
nina todds house in about five minutes pivnick said police 
would not let them near his house 
by saturday the sinkhole had stabilized with the evacuated todd 
house on one side off its cracked foundation and bowed in the 
center 
a major cause of sinkholes is the altering of water tables 
flowing through limestone and clay formations under the soil a 
sudden lowering of the water table caused by irrigation or drought 
for instance can weaken walls and roofs of the underground 
limestone caverns leading to their collapse

of tomorrow for i have seen yesterday and i love today 
today she takes more naps than when she started working at 
first national bank her hearing isnt the greatest and when she 
walks its a slow gait

contra leaders outraged over actions of the 
sandinistas said they want the next round of peace talks outside 
nicaragua while president daniel ortega has insisted that any new 
discussions take place in the country 
two of the fivemember nicaraguan resistance adolfo calero and 
joaquin chamorro returned here sunday following the second round 
of stalled talks 
a key issue has been the workings of the ceasefire agreement 
signed in sapoa nicaragua on march 23 
they are hinging the entire ceasefire agreement on how goods 
will be delivered instead of on the democratization of nicaragua 
chamorro said we had already agreed on how the goods will be 
delivered and now they bring it up again 
the leaders of the usbacked rebels expressed outrage with the 
actions of the leftist government during the talks saying 
nicaraguan officials had reneged on promises and created an 
oppressive atmosphere that jeopardizes future talks in the wartorn 
country 
they have been carrying on a succession of repressive actions 
against the people of nicaragua calero said 
they have taken action against striking workers the interior 
minister has beaten one of nicaraguas distinguished radio 
reporters he said and we are forced to stay in our hotel like 
its a prison 
on friday jose castillo osejo director of the antisandinista 
radio corporation claimed interior minister tomas borge summoned 
him to his office berated the radios reporting of antigovernment 
demonstrations and punched him in the mouth 
the next round of talks have been tentatively set for may 1224 
calero hopes they will be held outside of nicaragua maybe in 
guatemala the dominican republic or costa rica 
but ortega harshly criticized the rebels in his may day speech 
sunday in managua and insisted that the talks continue in 
nicaragua 
its tough to endure having them here in managua we have to 
disinfect the entire city after these people leave ortega told 
several thousand backers but now that were meeting in 
nicaragua the meetings have to continue in nicaragua 
rebel leaders say the latest round of talks stalled over details 
of how contra forces may receive humanitarian supplies during a 
pact that calls for rebels to enter truce zones the government is 
then to free 700 prisoners and allow contras to join talks with 
nicaraguan political parties 
the contras on friday rejected a sandinista proposal that the 
international red cross resupply the rebels 
chamorro said the red cross in nicaragua is just another arm 
of the sandinista government he preferred that a private carrier 
agreeable to both sides bring in food clothing and medicine 
sandinista police on friday cordoned off the entrance to an 
antigovernment workers union where demonstrations had been taking 
place about 1500 construction workers were protesting economic 
measures enacted a week earlier 
thirtyeight of those workers are on a hunger strike in 
nicaragua and contra spokesman jorge rosales said sunday that a 
group of nicaraguan exiles in miami would lend support by starting 
a similar hunger strike

iranian radicals will try to win control 
of irans parliament in a runoff election on may 13 that could 
determine the future course of the islamic revolution 
the staunchly antiwestern radicals made sizeable gains in the 
first round of voting on april 8 for 188 of the 270 seats in the 
majlis or parliament but no faction won a majority the runoff 
will be for the 82 remaining seats 
the results of the first round announced by irans staterun 
media show a tilt toward the radicals with some leading 
conservatives losing their seats 
the radicals could be helped in the runoff by the antiamerican 
passions that resulted after six iranian vessels were destroyed or 
disabled in the persian gulf in battles with the us navy on april 
18 
if the radicals win control of the legislature they could use 
that antiamerican sentiment to adopt an even tougher stand against 
us intervention in the gulf over the next fouryear parliamentary 
term 
tehran radio reported that just under 17 million iranians voted 
in the first round about 80 percent of the electorate 
interior ministry aliakbar mohtashemi a hardliner whose power 
is growing declared that the turnout for the third parliamentary 
election since ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 1979 revolution was a 
record 
among the winners were hojatoleslam mehdi karroubi firebrand 
head of irans pilgrimage bureau who is believed to have 
masterminded riots in the holy city of mecca last july karroubi a 
middleranking cleric heads a radical group called militant 
clergymen 
according to figures released by irans interior ministry and 
broadcast by tehran radio he polled 971752 votes in his tehran 
constituency second only to house speaker hashemi rafsanjani one 
of the most powerful figures in iran 
rafsanjani a close confidant of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
took more than 13 million votes the highest single vote so far 
announced 
the results so far indicate that the third majlis will be 
heavily weighted in favor of the radicals opening the way for 
reformist legislation said londonbased analyst vahe petrossian 
in the middle east economic digest 
however gary sick a former iran specialst with the us 
national security agency said in a telephone interview the real 
picture wont emerge until the runoffs and when the majlis 
elects the cabinet 
nonetheless the election is expected to produce big gains for 
the radicals who are advocating major economic and social reforms 
long blocked by conservative clerics and the bazaaris the 
wealthy merchant class who have survived the revolution and still 
wield considerable influence 
although the final makeup of the majlis remains incomplete the 
firstround voting appears to have bolstered both rafsanjani who 
favors economic reforms and prime minister hussein musavi 
among other radicals who won were ateqe sediqi rajai widow of 
the late president mohammed ali rajai and one of 35 women among 
the 1700 candidates 
rajai was assassinated with prime minister mohammed javad 
bahonar when leftist opponents of khomeini bombed bahonars office 
aug 31 1981 
another winner was hadi ghafari an islamic ideologue who 
trained with the plo in lebanon and was a key figure in forming 
khomeinis revolutionary guards 
he was among the winners in 14 of the 30 tehran districts where 
final results were announced along with fakhreddin hejazi another 
firebrand mullah who got more than 700000 votes and former 
agriculture minister mohammad salamati with more than 500000 
one of the winners in the holy city of qom was hojatoleslam 
sadeq khalkali a former islamic judge who ordered the execution of 
hundreds of people by firing squad or the hangmans rope in the 
early days of the revolution tehran radio said he polled nearly 
200000 votes in the first ballot 
several leading conservatives were either knocked out of the 
running or failed to win absolute majorities and now face runoff 
competition may 13 according to monitored radio reports 
among them were rafsanjanis deputy mohammad yazdi a prominent 
deputy in the majlis and former commerce minister habib 
asgarouladi 
former interior minister ayatollah aliakbar nateqnouri a

after eight months on the job and several disputes 
with jewish leaders the american rabbi who leads east germanys 
tiny jewish community is heading home and may not return to 
communist east berlin 
they attempted to silence me altogether rabbi isaac neuman 
said of the leadership of east berlins jewish community 
neuman the communist countrys first rabbi in 21 years said 
i dont want to come across as whining or as an enemy of the 
state or as being defeated he added i can at least say i have 
tried i cannot say i feel i have accomplished everything 
neuman said he plans to return to illinois on may 16 
its conceivable it the return is for good but i may be 
back in september i have no intention of being here beyond 1988 
because the situation is too impossible to work 
in an interview with the associated press on sunday neuman 
compared his situation to a brief stint as a rabbi in alabama in 
the early 1960s when he ran into strong resistance for speaking out 
in favor of civil rights for blacks 
in a sense i feel the same kind of isolation the feisty 
65yearold reform rabbi said in his apartment in east berlin 
the polishborn survivor of auschwitz and nine other nazi 
concentration camps took over the post that had been empty since 
1966 he is the rabbi for the less than 350 officially registered 
jews and about 100 people he says are on the fringes 
the largest jewish community with a little under 200 members 
is located in east berlin others are in the cities of halle 
dresden and leipzig 
neuman took over the post in september 1987 after retiring as 
rabbi in champaign illinois 
since then he has run into several disputes with the head of 
the jewish community in east berlin whom he asked the ap not to 
identify by name 
maybe he has orders from somewhere to keep me under control 
neuman says he even controls my mail 
neuman says there have been efforts within the jewish community 
to silence him for example by making it difficult to teach adult 
religious classes 
i was told not to speak on friday night because the service 
was too long but thats a lie says neuman it was designed to 
silence me 
he also has taken to task the editor of a governmentrun east 
german newspaper for alleged inaccuracies in reporting about 
israel he also is worried about antisemitism in the news media 
and points to the work of an east german cartoonist he says uses 
such themes 
neuman also criticized the governments unwillingness to help 
restore the dilapidated jewish community building where he works 
yes i have violated taboos he says but insists everything 
he has done is permitted even in east germany 
neuman is paid by the east berlin jewish community which in 
turn receives funds from the communist government 
the rabbi emphasized during the ap interview he had always 
viewed his post as a temporary assignment 
neuman said that he would return to his home in champaign 
asked if he planned to write an autobiography the rabbi replied 
with a smile i soon may have enough time 
while neuman outlines his disagreements in east berlin there 
has been some criticism of him as well 
the jewish community in east berlin is startled by the 
unconventionality and the independence of their rabbi the 
authoritative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper said of him 
in a profile on april 19 
the west german newspaper also said the tempermental rabbi 
had threatened to leave in the past

the last time bobbie lou meserole stood under the 
spotlights before an applauding crowd she was taking off the cloth 
instead of putting it on 
at one time she was known as shari angel and she was the most 
popular exotic dancer in dallas the rev wv grant jr said 
into the loudspeaker system of the eagles nest cathedral and 
from now on shes going to be called the reverend bobbie lou 
messerole 
the former stripper for jack rubys carousel nightclub was 
ordained during a sunday night service before the redcarpeted 
altar of the sprawling church 
im finally delivered from everything im really with the 
lord said ms meserole 54 im not with other people anymore 
im just a different person 
as a girl ms meserole said she dreamed of becoming a nun 
named sister louise she attended a private catholic school until 
her father made her quit when she was 13 she worked at a drug 
store and then at a hospital before falling on hard times and 
moving into show business at 22 
she was a stripper at rubys club in downtown dallas and was 
married to a locally popular comedian who once got into a fight 
with lee harvey oswald for heckling during an act and calling her 
husband a communist 
she was still working as a stripper at the carousel when on 
sunday morning nov 24 1963 she turned on her television the 
weekend of president john f kennedys assassination and saw her 
boss pull a gun and fatally shoot oswald in the basement of the 
dallas police station 
by the time she was 35 she said she turned to prostitution to 
alcohol and later to pills four years ago while under treatment 
at an arlington hospital she turned to god 
im writing a book to help other people like me that were sick 
and beat and were left for dead so they dont have to live through 
that ms meserole said during a year in the sanitarium i saw 
a lot of people and they can be healed and my story will help 
she said she plans to preach beginning with a downtown rally 
later this month but most of her work as an ordained minister of 
grants charismatic international deliverance church will involve 
counseling others 
ill go wherever the lord leads me but the county jail is 
what ive got in my heart right now she said i want to go and 
talk to the prostitutes and the alcoholics and the people with all 
kind of problems 
she now spends six days a week cleaning homes for a living and 
said she didnt expect that to change much after the sunday night 
service its a far cry from the late 1950s and early 60s at the 
carousel when she would dance along a runway stripping to a 
gstring and pasties as the top act in town 
but its still exciting in a different way she said and 
its a whole different life 
grant whose church recently moved into its huge hillside 
complex on dallas west side said ms meseroles message will be 
heard by those he and other preachers cant reach 
she can walk up to them and say i know what youre going 
through he said

jeanmarie le pen frances extreme right leader 
refused to endorse conservative premier jacques chirac but told 
supporters not to vote for president francois mitterrand in the may 
8 presidential runoff election 
we are in a position of choosing between the bad and the 
worst le pen told 30000 of his national front followers in the 
tuileries gardens in the heart of paris on sunday 
le pen who ran on an antiimmigration french first 
platform was eliminated along with six other candidates in 
firstround voting april 24 but his surprisingly strong showing 
means his national front followers could influence the outcome of 
the runoff 
le pen called the runoff vote on may 8 a formality the 
socialist mitterrand is widely considered a cinch to win 
the rightwing candidate told his supporters to organize for the 
future once the people of france are informed we will be the 
majority he said 
hundreds of riot police sealed off the area fearing clashes 
with tens of thousands of unionists protesting le pen in 
countermarches 
le pen called his rally to honor may day and joan of arc 
advancing her traditional feast day by a week because of the may 8 
election le pen has appropriated joan of arc as a national front 
symbol 
supporters first marched through the center of paris then moved 
to the lushly green tuileries where a roman catholic mass was said 
in latin 
le pen 59 took 144 percent of the firstround vote worrying 
many who fear the national front could awaken racist sentiments 
since april 24 chirac has tried to attract le pens following 
stressing the need to stop immigration and conserve frances 
national identity top themes of le pen who claims that france 
inundated by immigrants from former north african colonies is 
being drained economically socially and culturally 
le pen called the socialist president a traitor for his views on 
immigrants and separatists in the strifetorn territory of new 
caledonia 
no no no not a single vote for francois mitterrand le 
pen said from his raindrenched stage in the elegant gardens 
overlooking the place de la concorde and the arch of triumph 
but le pen avoided a straight yes or no on chirac whom 
he referred to as the residual candidate 
le pen spelled out three possibilities for his followers stay 
home vote for chirac to avoid the worst or decide at the last 
minute depending on chiracs statements in the final week of the 
campaign 
if jacques chirac is defeated he has only himself his 
friends and his allies to blame le pen said we have no 
responsibility in the voting

undocumented aliens hoping to legalize their status have flocked 
to immigration offices as the application deadline nears and some 
officials believe the cost of filing kept them away until the last 
minute 
you cant help but ask these people what have you been doing 
the last 11 months said jesse peterson an official of the 
lima pa legalization office referring to the duration of the 
amnesty program 
peterson attributed the surge in lastminute applications to 
procrastination and fear about the program he said sunday that his 
office processed over 300 applications last week 
undocumented aliens face a midnight wednesday deadline to file 
applications for legal status under the 1986 immigration reform and 
control act they must prove continuous residency in the united 
states since jan 1 1982 filing is the first step toward 
citizenship 
the immigration and naturalization service office in corpus 
christi texas handled about 250 applications saturday and sunday 
said spokesman carlos paz who believed many more would have shown 
up had they expected the office to be open through the weekend 
this whole month we have processed 1858 people which is 
almost what we did in the first three or four months of the 
program paz said 
paz said some applicants slept outside the center to complete 
paperwork and wait for a work permit rather than file applications 
and set a date for a later appointment 
theyre getting desperate because theyve waited too long and 
some are still looking for additional paperwork and theyre finding 
out they dont have the documents said paz and a lot of them 
dont have the money for the filing fee lets face it 
more than 1000 illegal aliens applied in oklahoma city last 
week fewer than expected officials said 
james walsh officer in charge of the office said the poor 
oklahoma economy may have made it tough for some applicants to come 
up with the filing fee of 185 a person or up to 420 per family 
he also cited the mobility of the illegal alien population for the 
smaller than expected number of applicants 
in new york officials believe the number of applications will 
exceed the revised target of 100000 they cited a sharp upturn in 
the number of aliens crowding ins offices in recent days 
one illegal immigrant who applied last week luis lopez 38 
said receiving legal status means being able to work without fear 
on a western michigan farm 
lopez said he paid to be smuggled into the united states from 
his native mexico in 1972 
i can look any man in the eye now and not be afraid lopez 
said i can walk straight as a man should the burden has been 
lifted off my shoulders 
wednesdays deadline does not apply to aliens applying for legal 
status under the seasonal agricultural worker provision of the 
immigration reform act they have until nov 30 
with the amnesty program about to end the government is 
preparing to shift the emphasis to employers the immigration 
reform act mandates sanctions against employers who knowingly hire 
undocumented workers 
starting june 1 the ins has the discretion to issue warning 
citations or fine employers who violate the law currently the ins 
must initially issue warning citations

three rightist elected officials 
today offered to change places with 21 hostages held by melanesian 
militants but the main separatist group ridiculed the proposal 
dick ukeiwe who represents new caledonia in the french senate 
said he and two members of the national assembly jacques lafleur 
and maurice nenou wished to take the place of the hostages to 
bring an end to their ordeal and to assume fully our 
responsibilities 
a group of melanesians who killed four gendarmes in an attack 
april 22 are still holding 21 officers hostage in a cave on ouvea 
a small island off the eastern coast of new caledonia 
bernard pons minister for overseas territories in premier 
jacques chiracs conservative government endorsed the proposed 
exchange and noumea mayor jean leques ordered all offices shops 
and bars in the capital closed at 4 pm 1 am edt in support of 
the idea 
the kanak socialist national liberation front known by its 
french initatials flnks dismissed the offer and reiterated the 
demand for a mediator with authority from chirac and socialist 
president francois mitterrand to negotiate a referendum on 
independence for the pacific island territory 
hnalaine uregei a member of the flnks political bureau told 
reporters the exchange proposal was at the same time grotesque 
ridiculous and indecent 
on sunday the front rejected monsignor michel calvet roman 
catholic archbishop of noumea as a mediator to negotiate the 
release of the hostages 
we want someone who would be representative of the colonial 
power who would have authority to commit the colonial power 
uregei said today 
uregei lafleur and nenou are all members of chiracs rightist 
party the rally for the republic and among the most prominent 
opponents of the separatist movement 
native melanesians known as kanaks make up 43 percent of new 
caledonias 145000 population about 36 percent of the population 
is european and the others are mostly asian or tahitian 
the fnlks is opposed to chiracs plan for giving partial 
autonomy to the territory as endorsed last year in a referendum 
boycotted by the separatists 
on april 22 the rebels raided a post of the gendarmerie 
police under military command seizing 27 officers and killing 
four twelve hostages were released but eight others taken 
including the head of an antiterrorism squad and an assistant 
prosecutor 
the prosecutor and the antiterrorism squad leader were freed 
and ordered to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists but told the 
remaining hostages would be killed if the two men did not return to 
the cave hideout because of that threat authorities still 
consider the two as hostages for a total of 23

the rev jimmy swaggarts refusal to stop 
appearing on two television shows produced by his ministry led the 
christian broadcasting network to drop the programs a cbn 
spokesman said 
we had given swaggart by mail a period of time to decide 
whether to comply with our request that he not appear in the 
shows earl weirich spokesman for the virginia beach vabased 
cable tv network said sunday 
if he wasnt going to appear we would continue to carry the 
shows but we were notified that he thought that was not in the 
best interest of swaggarts evangelical association said weirich 
the decision deprives swaggart of the largest network carrying 
his shows cbn carries religious shows childrens shows 
documentaries reruns of old tv series and family entertainment to 
nearly 37 million homes the spokesman said 
swaggarts ministry paid to air the shows which had an average 
viewership of 40000 to 80000 homes said weirich who was in los 
angeles for the annual convention of the national cable television 
association 
on sunday the network canceled the weekly hourlong broadcast 
of services from swaggarts louisiana church it also pulled a 
weekday morning bible study called a study in the word which 
was replaced with a halfhour animated childrens show of bible 
stories called flying house 
the cancellations follow swaggarts refusal to accept a yearlong 
preaching suspension ordered by national directors of the assembies 
of god denomination that followed a threemonth suspension by the 
assemblies louisiana directors after swaggart confessed publicly 
to unspecified sins which reportedly involved voyeurism with a new 
orleans prostitute 
swaggart has said he will resume preaching may 22 
in the letter to swaggart about two weeks ago cbn offered to 
retain the programs if he remained off them for the year weirich 
said 
a spokesman for swaggart could not be reached because he does 
not take calls on weekends 
according to figures released by arbitron last month swaggarts

the first person to glide across the united states 
the sailplane eagle with pilot terry frazier 41 at the 
controls was lifted into the air by a tow plane sunday at brown

nascar stock car race 
others have tried similar flights but have been forced to 
complete part of the trip by hauling their sailplanes on a trailer 
he said 
im not real concerned with whether i accomplish being the 
first person to fly a glider the entire distance im in it for 
the challenge of making the flight frazier said before takeoff

said it will be replaced by a livelier new magazine that readers 
will enjoy 
red flag for decades the definitive account of chinas 
political theory will cease publication june 16 and be replaced 
july 1 by the magazine seek truth the new title comes from a

the new magazine will firmly implement the policy of let a 
hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend and 
have lively theoretical discussion said su xing red flags 
associate editor 
the 100 flowers slogan refers to mao tsetungs 1957 call 
for intellectuals to freely voice criticisms of the party the 
campaign was followed in 1958 by a severe crackdown 
in short we will publish a lively magazine that readers 
will enjoy reading su 30 said in an interview in the official 
peoples daily

decided to stop publishing red flag because other publications have 
taken over its role as the voice of the party 
thoughts of chinas leaders are now found in the peoples daily 
the weekly outlook and the national guangming daily which is aimed 
at chinas intellectuals 
red flag once was required reading for chinese and foreigners

for supporting the oldguard conservative line being displaced by 
chinas more pragmatic reformminded leaders 
su said seek truth would reflect the thinking of chinas 
leadership by discussing the reforms in china and looking into the 
current political situation especially the problems created by

irish republican army guerrillas 
who killed three british soldiers and injured three in a car 
bombing and an ambush may have escaped from the netherlands police 
said today 
it is easy to escape police spokesman louis steens told 
reporters in roermond six miles from the west german border he 
said it takes a short time to get away through relatively open 
borders with germany and belgium 
one british airman was killed and two injured in this 
southeastern city when their car was sprayed with automatic weapons 
fire early sunday morning an hour later a car bomb in 
nieuwbergen 30 miles north of roermond exploded killing two 
british airmen and severely injured a third 
police said the two attacks on the six servicemen who were 
visiting from their bases in west germany were closely coordinated 
there are no border controls for passenger cars crossing the 
dutchbelgian border 30 miles from roermond the west german border 
is more tightly controlled but also has some unmanned crossings at 
night 
the ira attacks were the groups first in the netherlands since 
the 1979 slaying of britains ambassador british forces in west 
germany were told today to take extra precautions when traveling in 
or near the netherlands 
signs at border crossings near roermond said bfg british 
forces in germany persons advised not to enter holland 
the irish british and dutch governments immediately condemned 
the attacks on the british soldiers the british government said 
the six airmen were off duty and unarmed when attacked 
in belfast northern ireland the ira claimed responsibility on 
sunday 
steens told reporters today that there were a few witnesses 
who spoke about a person they saw in roermond when three royal 
air force enlisted men were fired on after getting into their car 
parked outside a local cafe 
it was a man steens said 
senior aircraftsman ian shinner 20 died instantly while a 
fellow airman was listed in serious condition at a local hospital 
and a third was treated for minor shoulder injuries the injured 
men were not identified 
in the nieuwbergen attack the car carrying the three service was 
torn apart by the blast as it pulled out of the parking lot of a 
discotheque two airmen john miller reid 22 and john baxter 21 
were killed and a third who was not identified was severely 
injured 
police appeared at a loss for clues to the trail of the 
assailants and at the news conference declined to confirm reports 
that the explosion that wrecked the car at nieuwbergen was caused 
by a bomb 
both border towns are frequent recreation destinations for 
british troops stationed in west german border bases 
the blast which could be heard up to five miles away caused a 
fireball higher than the shops said henk mennink who runs a 
nearby snack bar 
you could see two bodies hanging on the front seats and 
pieces of skin were lying at my door mennink told the ap on 
sunday 
the victims were in the netherlands for local festivities 
marking the official 50th birthday of dutch queen beatrix both 
their cars carried british license plates 
police evacuated homes in nieuwbergen on sunday and searched 
other britishregistered cars for possible bombs 
the ira claim of responsibility was received by media in belfast 
the groups message said we have a simple message for 
british prime minister mrs margaret thatcher disengage from 
ireland and there will be peace if not there will be no haven for 
your military personnel and you will regularly be at airports 
awaiting your dead 
the message was an apparent reference to the british leaders 
highly publicized march 23 trip to a royal air force base for the 
return of the bodies of two british soldiers killed four days 
earlier at an ira funeral in belfast 
the victims from sundays shooting attack were based at a royal 
air force base in wildenrath west germany and were members of 16

the government will consider whether servicemen 
should continue using special british license plates following the 
irish republican armys slaying of three airmen in the netherlands 
a minister said today 
the ira has threatened to kill more british servicemen following 
sundays attacks in which three airmen also were injured 
the six servicemen were traveling in two cars with special 
license plates one car was sprayed with machinegun fire the 
other was destoyed by a bomb 
several british lawmakers have criticized the license plates as 
a giveaway to terrorists 
armed forces minister ian stewart was asked in a british 
broadcasting corp radio interview whether their continued use 
would be looked at as part of the security review promised on 
sunday by defense secretary george younger 
yes it certainly will he said there are a number of 
aspects we want to look into and that is certainly one of them we 
will want to draw any possible lessons from these attacks 
stewart said the government would look into anything it could do 
to tighten up the security or increase the potential safety of 
our lads 
the six servicemen visiting the netherlands from their bases in 
west germany were unarmed and off duty when attacked british 
officials said 
on sunday and today the british forces broadcasting service 
aired warnings to soldiers and airmen who were away from their 
bases in west germany terrorists only look at you for one 
reason be alert stay alive 
the three men killed were identified by the british defense 
ministry as ian shinner 20 who was machinegunned in roermond 
and john miller reid 22 and john baxter 21 who were blown up in 
their car in nieuwbergen 
all three were senior airmen in the royal air force regiment 
which guards air bases they were visiting dutch discotheques and 
bars just across the border which stay open later than german ones 
the three airmen were believed to be the first british military 
fatalities caused by the ira on the european continent there had 
been attacks on british bases but no deaths sundays killings also 
ended a 14month lull in ira attacks outside northern ireland 
the ira claimed responsibility for the deaths with a statement 
through the irish republican publicity bureau in dublin saying it 
had a simple message for british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
disengage from ireland and there will be peace if not then 
there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will 
regularly be at airports awaiting your dead 
the message referred to mrs thatchers much publicized visit to 
northolt royal air force base in england on march 23 for the return 
of the bodies of two british soldiers lynched in belfast by 
mourners at an ira funeral which they had driven into 
the killings were seen as retaliation for the march 6 shootings 
by british security forces of three unarmed ira members in 
gibraltar on march 6 the army said the guerrillas were preparing 
to bomb an army parade 
the british armed forces have nearly 70000 personnel and 80000 
dependants stationed in west germany at four raf and five army 
bases 
since launching its violent campaign to end british rule in 
northern ireland in 1969 the ira has killed 392 british soldiers 
there and 24 in mainland britain 
the known death toll in northern ireland is 2642 according to 
belfast police it includes 253 police officers 174 militia of the 
britishtrained ulster defense regiment and 1823 civilians 
the ira has a network of support in the netherlands belgium and 
west germany in 1986 dutch police arrested two major ira figures 
who were involved in a 1983 escape from belfasts maze prison and 
had spent several years in the netherlands

detailed analysis of a jetliner that had 
part of its fuselage blown off while flying at 24000 feet found 
cracks apparently caused by metal fatigue a federal official said 
what appears preliminarily to be fatigue cracking was found 
at six rivet holes on a metal strip running the length of the 
aircraft joseph nall of the national transportation safety board 
said at a news conference sunday night 
the cracks measuring 02 to 06 inch were discovered on the 
metal strip called the no 10 stringer that ran above the 
passenger windows on the left side of the aloha airlines boeing 
737 nall said 
nall said all of the planes rivets as well as those on alohas 
other 737s were being tested electronically in an effort to find 
any other cracks 
in an interview on nbctvs today show nall said that 
although the general question of metal fatigue in older jetliners 
has been discussed and debated in the industry for years the 
safety board viewed the aloha accident as calling significant 
attention to the problem 
the plane made an emergency landing thursday at the airport in 
this maui island town the flight from hilo to honolulu carried 95 
people including 89 passengers 
twenty feet of the planes upper fuselage covering first class 
passengers tore away a flight attendant who had worked 37 years 
with aloha clarabelle lansing 57 of honolulu apparently was 
sucked from the plane to her death while 61 other people were 
injured 
seven remained at maui memorial hospital on sunday in stable 
condition with burns and lacerations nursing supervisor beverly 
perreira said 
the seven who were sitting in the area of the rupture mainly 
in window seats received their cuts from jagged sections of what 
remained of the fuselage nall said 
they also suffered wind burn he said 
only 30 percent of the fuselage remained intact at the point of 
the rupture 
nall said tests found that repairs made last november to two 
cracks in the planes no 4 stringer located farther up the 
fuselage appeared to have held 
a service bulletin issued by boeing in april told airlines to 
look for corroding fasteners that hold pieces of the fuselage 
together 
close inspection of the upper skin of earlymodel boeing 737s 
was ordered oct 5 by the federal aviation administration after 
routine inspections turned up cracks near where sections of sheet 
metal overlap officials said friday the agency warned the problem 
could cause rapid cabin decompression they said 
inspections carried out because of the faa order turned up 
nothing unusual said aloha airlines spokeswoman stephanie ackerman 
in the wake of the accident the faa has barred some of the 
oldest versions of the 737 from flying above 23000 feet 
the order affects 66 plans operated by aloha american and 
piedmont airlines that have made more than 55000 landings the 
aloha plane in service since 1969 had made 85000 to 90000 
landings 
air and sea searchs failed to located any trace of the missing 
fuselage section officials said 
the section tore away while the first officer mimi tompkins 
was flying the plane at 322 mph to 333 mph nall said saturday the 
flight crew donned oxygen masks as tompkins turned the controls 
over capt robert schornstheimer he said 
the plane hit the runway at 195 mph 45 mph faster than a normal 
landing because schornstheimer found the jets flaps used for 
deceleration would not work properly nall said

a member of the senate foreign relations 
committee criticizing confused us efforts in panama called 
on the reagan administration today to bring central american 
nations together to pressure panamanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega to resign 
theres been no multilateral effort sen john kerry 
dmass said on abctvs good morning america theres been 
no effort to create a central american solution 
kerry said us military and intelligence officials have been at 
odds with the administrations diplomatic and economic efforts to 
oust the panamanian strongman who has known since the beginning 
that theres been a divided administration 
theres been no process of building a congressional and an 
administration bipartisan foreign policy here as we did for 
instance in the philippines said kerry 
noriega has also been bolstered by the lack of opposition to his 
rule from panamas neighbors he said 
if we were to isolate noriega further from the support the 
small support he is currently getting said kerry if we were 
to bring pressure to bear from other central american countries so 
that he knows there is a united front against him which he is 
aware does not exist today you would increase your leverage 
kerrys criticism came after reports this weekend that the 
reagan administration was negotiating a deal for noriega to resign 
but remain in the country 
treasury secretary james a baker said sunday that talks with 
noriega aimed at his removal from power are continued this weekend 
but he said only progress is being made 
interviewed on nbctvs meet the press baker said he could 
not discuss whether noriega would be allowed to remain in panama 
saying the talks were sensitive and were going on as we 
talk 
panamas commerce minister said sunday that drug trafficking 
charges must be dropped against noriega before serious negotiations 
can take place 
the us approach in the noriega negotiations also was 
criticized sunday by sen richard lugar a top republican foreign 
policy expert in the senate and by panamas antinoriega 
ambassador to the united states juan sosa 
baker said he expected the us goal of removing noriega to be 
met but declined to predict when or under what circumstances 
i dont think it would be helpful for me to get into 
hypothetical questions about leaving power staying in panama or 
leaving power and getting out of panama he said 
he said the announcement saturday that the 40000 americans 
living in panama could pay utility garbage and other bills to the 
noriegacontrolled government so services could be resumed was not 
a lifting of sanctions he said such exemptions were contemplated 
in the original orders cutting off public and private payments to 
panama 
administration officials said friday that noriega had agreed 
during private talks with a reagan administration envoy to step 
down but not leave the country however the deal was denied by 
officials in panama city and panama commerce minister mario 
rognoni on sunday called the miami indictment against noriega on 
drug trafficking charges a political ploy 
what we see is the united states acting as kind of a terrorist 
group now where they are trying to hold hostage general noriega by 
discrediting him by making a political indictment and then trying 
to release the hostage by getting some changes to your benefit 
said rognoni in an interview on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
for us the us has to withdraw a political indictment that 
was set to have him as hostage of the us foreign policy and 
after that indictment is taken care of then we can sit and discuss 
anything you want with relation to the uspanama relationship 
said rognoni 
also appearing in separate interviews on the abc program were 
lugar rind rep lee hamilton dind and sosa 
lugar a member of the senate foreign relations committee said 
the united states should keep open the military option for 
changing panamas government but should not use force or make a 
deal with noriega without support from panamanians and other latin 
american countries 
he said the united states should be working with others rather 
than having a unilateral emissary going back and forth sometimes 
without the apparent support of all elements of our government 
hamilton also pushed for more regional involvement in us 
efforts against noriega and said it would be a very severe 
mistake to use military force in panama 
the panamanian defense forces are not to be taken lightly 
he said 
sosa who supports ousted president eric arturo delvalle said 
the us negotiations with noriega are not meaningful for the 
opposition because the notion of him staying in the country is 
unacceptable 
drastic actions of an economic nature of a political nature 
and some sort of military action will be needed to get him out 
the envoy said the military action he said should be by 
panamanians

gunfire shook the capital today as police reported 12 people died 
and 35 were wounded in factional fighting in palestinian refugee 
camps and neighboring shiite moslem slums 
meanwhile the synod of maronite catholic bishops met in an 
emergency session at the residence of the communitys patriarch to 
investigate the kidnapping torture and killing of monsignor albert 
khreish 53 head of the maronite spiritual affairs court 
the meeting was chaired by the nasrallah sfeir patriarch of the 
850000 maronites who make up lebanons largest christian community 
police said khreishs bulletriddled body was found sunday by a

khreishs face and that he had been shot at least 30 times 
they had no immediate indication as to the reason for his 
abduction and slaying in an area controlled by the lebanese forces 
the christians main militia 
christian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
victims sister is the wife of the elder brother of nayef hawatmeh 
a palestinian leader who heads the moscoworiented democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine

the murder one source said 
the lebanese forces militia is a bitter enemy of the 
palestinians who have fought alongside other moslems in lebanons 
13yearold civil war

construction spending powered by a big gain 
in government projects shot up 15 percent in march the biggest 
increase in almost a year 
the commerce department said that construction spending rose to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4018 billion in march 
following a 04 percent increase in february 
the march advance was the biggest since a 2 percent gain in 
april 1987 and reflected increases in all of the major categories 
the advance was led by a 54 percent surge in spending on 
government building projects which climbed to an annual rate of 
823 billion 81 percent higher than a year ago 
highway construction the biggest single government category 
posted a 7 percent increase to an annual rate of 276 billion 
residential construction rose 08 percent in march to an annual 
rate of 1914 billion as a 2 percent increase in singlefamily 
construction was nearly offset by a 36 percent decline in 
multifamily construction 
nonresidential construction edged up 03 percent to an annaul 
rate of 923 billion with industrial construction office building 
and hotel construction all recording gains 
the february and march increases followed declines of 23 
percent in january and 002 percent in december analysts are 
looking for only moderate strength in construction this year 
because of widespread overbuilding of offices and apartments

the supreme court today agreed to hear a 
reagan administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the us 
government to turn over tax information to a foreign government 
the court said it will review a ruling that limited access by 
canadian officials to financial records of two canadian citizens 
with bank accounts in washington state 
the canadian department of national revenue the equivalent of 
the internal revenue service here sought records of philip stuart 
and mons kapoor both canadian citizens have accounts with the 
northwestern commercial bank in bellingham wash 
the canadian officials said they are investigating the two mens 
tax liability for 1980 1981 and 1982 
the officials sought the help of the us government under a 
1942 treaty between the two nations and the irs issued summonses 
to the bank in 1984 
stuart and kapoor then asked a federal judge to block the 
summonses the judge declined but the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled in their favor last year 
the appeals court ordered the bank records withheld unless us 
officials state the canadian tax investigation has not reached a 
stage analogous to one in this country in which the irs would refer 
the case to the justice department for criminal prosecution 
we do not believe that requiring the irs to make such a 
statement will unduly restrict the services summonsing authority 
or impede enforcement of summonses the appeals court said 
but administration lawyers said the ruling could hinder us 
treaty obligations and impair the ability of investigators here to 
obtain foreign financial records 
the ruling requires a treaty partners tax investigation to 
meet standards grounded in domestic policies that have no 
application in the treaty partners jurisdiction the 
governments appeal said 
it unnecessarily hinders investigations that the united states 
has pledged by treaty to assist and that are entirely proper under 
the laws of the treaty partner the appeal added 
the united states has such tax treaties with 31 foreign 
governments and also exchanges information under other agreements 
reached with carribean basin nations 
the case is us vs stuart 871064

hundreds of soviet emigres applauded natan 
sharansky when they elected him chairman of a group of fellow 
former soviet refuseniks that plans to challenge israels 
immigration policies 
the recent arrival of a few thousand immigrants showed how bad 
the immigrant absorption system is sharansky said at the meeting 
sunday how can we talk about attracting tens of thousands of 
immigrants to israel when we cant even deal with the few thousand 
who came last year 
the 40yearold human rights activist who spent nine years in 
soviet labor camps conducted a threeweek campaign to unite about 
20 groups representing soviet jews into an umbrella lobbying forum 
about 400 activists at the meeting spoke in russian and proudly 
displayed round blue badges designating them as delegates there 
are about 200000 former soviet jews in israel 
sharansky said he wants to set up a private fund to provide 
lowinterest housing loans for immigrants and create a company that 
immigrants can go to for help in building lowcost housing 
he also proposed an employment agency to help find work for 
immigrants and clubs to help immigrants adjust to life in israel 
sharansky said american jewish organizations are ready to donate 
funds directly to the immigrants on condition that they speak with 
a single voice 
his attempt to unite the emigres is not the first in the 19 
years of soviet jewish emigration others have ended in failure 
among them an allsoviet jewish party that did not gather the 
necessary votes to win a parliament seat 
sharansky has the support of many activists and has succeeded in 
bypassing political differences by declaring his forum a 
nonpolitical nonaffiliated group 
we shall try to speak in one voice about the issues we agree 
upon without involving political arguments he said but he 
dismissed the notion that his movement may become a political party 
sharansky played a similar role among soviet jews refused 
permission to leave the soviet union in the 1970s the best known 
soviet dissident after andrei sakharov he was arrested in 1977 
convicted of being a us spy and sentenced to 13 years in soviet 
prisons he and the united states denied he was a spy 
sharansky was released in february 1986 and came to israel to 
meet his wife avital who left the soviet union a day after they 
were married in 1974 
sharansky was seen as a prize for political parties but he has 
called israeli politics nightmarish 
for a long time i was very cautious about getting involved 
he said but now its time to unite 
others at the meeting expressed concern about the high number of 
soviet jewish dropouts jews who decided to settle in the 
united states or west european countries instead of israel 
of more than 8000 jews permitted to leave the soviet union in 
1987 only 20 percent settled in israel in april 1088 jews left 
the soviet union and only 180 came to israel israeli reports said

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods climbed 16 percent in march the biggest increase in three 
months the commerce department said today 
the department said that orders for durable and nondurable 
goods rose to a seasonally adjusted 21608 billion in march the 
best showing since a 2 percent rise in december 
the march advance represented surprising strength especially 
since the government had reported 10 days ago in a preliminary 
report that orders for durable goods had remained frozen in march 
that was changed today to show a healthy 1 percent increase 
reflecting newfound demand in orders for primary metals and 
machinery and in the transportation sector 
the 16 percent overall increase followed no change in february 
and a slight 06 percent drop in january 
during the first two months of the year many businesses cut 
back on orders in an effort to reduce a large buildup of unsold 
goods 
originally there was concern that the big rise in unsold goods 
that had occurred in the last three months of 1987 would topple the 
country into a recession especially if jittery consumers stopped 
buying bigticket items following the oct 19 stock market collapse 
these fears proved unwarranted however as a rebound in 
consumer spending helped propel the overall economy to healthy 
growth at an annual rate of 23 percent in the first three months 
of the year 
the 16 percent march increase in factory orders was aided in 
part by a 174 percent surge in demand for military equipment 
which rose to 1004 billion without this big defense buildup the 
overall orders increase would have been a smaller 1 percent 
the key category of nondefense capital goods fell 38 percent 
to 325 billion despite the setback analysts are still looking 
for this sector to show strength this year as us businesses boost 
spending on expansion projects to meet rising demand 
orders for transportation equipment climbed 34 percent while 
orders for primary metals such as steel were up 61 percent and 
orders for nonelectrical machinery advanced 21 percent 
orders for nondurable goods items not expected to last three 
years rose 23 percent to 1006 billion 
shipments of manufactured goods increased 26 percent to a 
record high of 2144 billion following a 08 percent february 
increase 
in a separate report the commerce department said that 
construction spending rose 15 percent in march the biggest 
increase since april 1987 
the advance was led by a 54 percent surge in spending on 
government building projects which climbed to an annual rate of 
823 billion 81 percent higher than a year ago

the supreme court today ruled that federal 
lawyers procedurally botched a contemptofcourt case against a 
rhode island newspaper that published fbi information about a mafia 
boss 
by a 62 vote the justices said the procedural flaw must result 
in dismissing the governments appeal from a ruling that the 
providence journal was justified in defying a judges order barring 
publication of the material 
the newspaper thus had its federal appeals court victory 
sustained without the supreme court ever reaching the merits of the 
contemptofcourt case 
having concluded that the courtappointed prosecutor who 
appealed and briefed and argued the case without the 
authorization of the solicitor general may not represent the united 
states before this court we dismiss the appeal justice harry 
a blackmun wrote 
the flaw was called to the courts attention by the journals 
lawyers who requested that the case be tossed out 
the controversy stems from publication of information the fbi 
obtained about raymond ls patriarca reputed longtime crime boss 
for new england by tapping his providence telephone without court 
approval from 1962 to 1965 
the journal was allowed access to fbi logs and memoranda from 
the recordings in 1985 after patriarca died 
but raymond j patriarca son of the reputed crime figure 
challenged in court the informations release he sought to bar 
publication 
us district judge francis j boyle held hearings on 
patriarcas complaint on nov 13 1985 and ordered the newspaper 
not to publish anything from the fbi materials until a nov 15 
hearing 
the journal on nov 14 published an article that included 
information from the fbi logs and memoranda 
boyle then ruled that the newspaper and its executive editor 
charles m hauser were in contempt he fined the journal 100000 
and ordered hauser to perform 200 hours of public service 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals overturned boyles 
ruling the appeals court said the order barring publication had 
been transparently invalid and the newspaper therefore could 
violate it with impunity 
when patriarca challenged release of the information boyle had 
appointed providence lawyer william a curran as a special 
prosecutor to represent the federal government because the fbi 
and justice department were defendants in patriarcas lawsuit 
curran also represented the government in the appeals court and 
filed the supreme court appeal that was granted review last october 
but curran never received justice department permission to file 
that appeal and the journals lawyers said the lack of permission 
was illegal 
federal law requires the solicitor general the justice 
departments topranking courtroom lawyer to file virtually all 
supreme court appeals for the government unless he authorizes 
someone else to do so 
just why curran was not authorized by solicitor general charles 
fried to file the appeal was not explained in briefs submitted to 
the justices 
the national law journal reported that sources close to the case 
blame the solicitor generals office which they say showed 
little interest in the case despite efforts by the special 
prosecutor to maintain contact 
writing for the court today blackmun said absent a proper 
representative of the government as a petitioner in this criminal 
prosecution jurisdiction is lacking and the appeal heretofore 
granted is now dismissed 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice john paul stevens 
dissented justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the 
case us vs providence journal co 8765

democrat michael dukakis today complained that 
president reagan has failed to provide enough money for daycare 
programs and called on him to endorse legislation to expand federal 
funding for child care 
one day earlier during a stop in toledo the frontrunner for 
the democratic presidential nomination said his likely november 
opponent vice president george bush did nothing to stop the 
reagan administration from dealing with drug runners instead of 
fighting the nations drug problem 
today at a daycare center in a cincinnati high school dukakis 
read a story to 12 children whose mothers attend the school 
this is the kind of thing we need dukakis said of the 
center we need to have it as a matter of national policy 
the massachusetts governor wrapping up his ohio campaign with 
stops in four cities today also called for steppedup federal 
efforts to help collect child support from delinquent fathers 
dukakis looking for big wins tuesday in ohio and indiana to 
cement his position in the race also said sunday that community 
intervention not capital punishment is the best way to curb drug 
trafficking 
dukakis met sunday with law enforcement officials in toledo and 
akron countering bushs recent focus on crime and drugs with sharp 
criticisms of past reagan administration dealings with panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega noriega is now under us 
indictment on drug charges 
dukakis also suggested the administration tolerated drug 
smugglers who were used to help resupply the administrationbacked 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
what kind of message is that for the courageous police 
officers school superintendents teachers educators and parents 
and the children of the united states of america dukakis asked 
in toledo 
this is an administration that cant say no to drug dealers 
itself how can it tell our kids to do that dukakis asked the 
greatest threat to our security in this hemisphere is not the 
sandinistas its the avalanche of drugs that is flowing into this 
country 
while he frequently attacked bush dukakis made no direct 
references to jesse jackson his sole remaining active democratic 
rival but he urged supporters to ignore a new poll showing him 
with an overwhelming lead in the race for ohios 159 democratic 
delegates 
my friends pollsters dont vote people do dukakis said 
dukakis used the backdrop of a county jail in toledo and 
confiscated drugs and weapons at a police station in akron to 
underscore his attacks on reagan administration drug policy 
bush the certain republican nominee has called on dukakis and 
jackson to support the death penalty for major drug suppliers 
its been tried said dukakis a staunch opponent of capital 
punishment it doesnt work 
instead he called for greater cooperation between federal 
state and local law enforcement and education officials and 
increased federal funding for drug programs 
such efforts dukakis said have been jerked around during 
the reagan years because of funding cuts 
if were going to solve the problem its got to be at the 
community level dukakis said from the steps of the county jail 
in toledo 
from there he went on to tony packos a restaurant often 
referred to by the fictional character max klinger in the 
television series mash 
there dukakis lashed out at attorney general edwin meese iii a 
favorite target in his effort to tie bush to a long list of 
allegedly improper activity in the reagan administration 
i want to be a president who will appoint an attorney general 
you and i can be proud of and who will put justice back in the 
department of justice dukakis said 
earlier sunday in cleveland dukakis said he could not describe 
bushs role as vice president because he had not distinguished 
himself on any issue 
im not sure i can answer what that role has been frankly 
because hes such a blank slate dukakis said 
while in cleveland dukakis participated in a may day parade in 
a polish neighborhood 
the poll of ohio residents released sunday by the akron beacon 
journal showed dukakis with a nearly 31 lead over jackson 62 
percent to 22 percent with 16 percent undecided and a 35 
percentage point margin of error the poll was conducted over 10 
days beginning april 20

authorities to challenge patdown searches conducted at kkk rallies 
throughout the state from 1980 through 1984 
the first kkk rally in connecticut in some 50 years was held in 
the rural town of scotland eight years ago connecticut state 
police learned that groups with a history of violent confrontations 
with the kkk planned several counterdemonstrations in scotland 
police obtained a court injunction allowing them to set up 
checkpoints and subject people headed to the rally site to patdown 
searches 
the searches yielded seven guns ammunition 41 knives two 
swords two machetes five baseball bats three pieces of pipe 
eight lengths of chain two cans of mace weighted knuckles and a 
number of clubs 
such patdown searches were conducted at most of the 16 kkk 
rallies subsequently held in connecticut communities and yielded 
similar weapons at each all people seeking to pass established 
checkpoints near the rally sites were advised of their right to 
turn back and avoid being frisked 
us district judge jose cabranes ruled that the ban on 
unreasonable police seaches contained in the constitutions fourth 
amendment was being violated by such patdown searches 
citing a 1967 supreme court ruling on police patdown searches 
cabranes said such tactics are lawful only when officers have a 
reasonable belief that a particular person poses a threat to public 
safety 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals essentially upheld the 
judges ruling last nov 9 
the mass patdown searches conducted at these klan rallies 
went beyond the bounds established by the fourth amendment the 
appeals court ruled 
but the 2nd circuit court modified cabranes ruling to allow 
police to search people and packages at such rallies with 
magnetometers devices that detect metal objects 
state authorities then sought supreme court review noting that 
magnetometer searches do not detect nonmetallic weapons such as 
clubs and bats 
their appeal likened the patdown searches to the growing number 
of public places such as the supreme courts building that use 
metal detectors 
we enter courthouses and other governmental buildings today 
expecting to pass through some sort of security system similar 
measures are employed with respect to air travel public 
appearances of high government officials or candidates for high 
office military installations diplomatic facilities and 
legislative chambers the appeal said 
we have seen too much ideologically related violence in our 
time to ignore the threat it poses the state authorities added 
niavete would be too costly 
the case is kelly vs wilkinson 871363

the supreme court today refused to let states 
tax pension fund income from investments in federal government 
securities 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by vermont 
officials who said they should be allowed to tax the income after 
it is distributed to retirees 
the vermont supreme court last december upheld a ruling by a 
state judge who said the pension fund money is taxexempt 
superior court judge mathhew i katz of windsor county ruled 
that interest on federal obligations such as shortterm 
government borrowing is immune from state taxation even when the 
income is passed on by a pension fund to a retired investor 
in practical operation the tax in question was in fact a 
state tax on interest derived from federal obligations katz 
said the fact that pension money was passed on to someone other 
than the fund itself does not eliminate the exemption enjoyed by 
investments in federal securities he said 
the judge rejected arguments by state officials that interest on 
a government security is exempt only in the hands of the original 
recipient unless there is a specific federal statute to pass 
through the taxexempt character of such income 
katz ruled in favor of loren d keys who when he retired in 
1981 received a lumpsum distribution of 141000 from a savings 
plan in which he had invested 
the money included 35000 in interest on federal securities 
vermont officials said keys owed an additional tax of 1246 on 
the income from the government obligations the court rulings in 
keys favor meant he received a tax refund of 203 plus interest 
vermont officials said a lot more was at stake they said the 
state court rulings could force them to examine the source of 
payments from pension and mutual funds corporate dividends and 
even bank deposit interest and then eliminate from the states tax 
base any income traced to investments in federal obligations 
the case is vermont vs keys 871583

defense attorneys for accused 
colombian drug lord carlos lehder rivas said today they will rest 
their case without calling any witnesses 
the surprise announcement came on the defenses opening day 
after us district judge howell melton denied defense attorneys 
motion for a 60day delay to allow them time to pore over thousands 
of documents introduced during the 22week trial 
lehder 38 allegedly one of the leaders of the violent medellin 
cartel is accused of smuggling 33 tons of cocaine into the united 
states from his private island of normans cay in the bahamas 
lehders attorney edward shohat said today the defense 
intended only to put some additional documents on the record 
after moving exhibits in evidence defendant lehder intends to 
rest his case this morning shohat said 
shohats move came as a surprise as late as last week he had 
estimated the defense would take two weeks 
assistant us attorney ernst mueller said he could not comment 
on the decision itself but added you could honestly say i 
looked surprised and stunned 
stephen weinbaum attorney for lehders codefendant jack 
carlton reed 57 said outside the courtrooom he also expects to 
rest his case immediately 
however weinbaum said he doubted either side would have closing 
arguments ready before the end of the week 
following shohats announcement melton called an hourlong 
recess to discuss the defense documents 
much of the testimony in the lehder trial has come from 
convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from prosecution from 
others hoping to lessen their sentences and from some who are 
awaiting sentencing 
carlos lehder pursued a singular dream a singular vision to 
be the king of cocaine transportation us attorney robert 
merkle said in his opening statement in lehders trial in 
midnovember he was to cocaine transportation what henry ford 
was to cars 
bahamian officials have also been mentioned during the trial 
with numerous witnesses alleging that prime minister lynden o 
pindling filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as 
lehder 
although no violence has been directly attributed to lehder in 
the sixmonth trial many witnesses have testified about threats 
communicated by lehder and his workers 
lehder is also charged in separate indictments in los angeles 
and miami 
the miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of 
the socalled medellin cartel believed to be responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into united states a bonanza 
worth 8 billion each year

the supreme court today ordered further lower 
court hearings to determine whether a new jersey man accused of 
helping nazis kill more than 2000 jews in lithuania should be 
stripped of his us citizenship 
by a 62 ruling the court set aside a lower court ruling that 
revoked the citizenship of 71yearold juozas kungys a retired 
dental technician from clifton nj 
the decision means at least a temporary postponement in the 
governments likely effort to deport kungys 
the justices also provided some guidelines for determining when 
the government may strip the citizenship of those accused of lying 
to gain entry to the united states and to win citizenship 
revoking citizenship a process called denaturalization is a 
preliminary step leading to deportation 
justice antonin scalia in his opinion for the court said 
citizens generally may be denaturalized if their alleged 
misstatements or concealments of facts had a natural tendency 
to influence decisions by immigration officials 
moreover scalia said another provision of immigration law 
permits denaturalization if the misstatements demonstrate lack of 
good moral character 
the court ordered the 3rd us circuit court of appeals to 
reconsider kungys case in light of the standards the justices 
outlined today 
the 3rd circuit court stripped kungys of his citizenship in 
1986 clearing the way for his likely deportation 
kungys has lived in the united states since 1948 and became a 
citizen in 1954 
the government said he lived in kedainiai lithuania in 1941 
when germanys nazi forces invaded that area and that he aided in 
atrocities against lithuanian jews 
government lawyers said kungys as a member of a miltiary 
organization known as sauliai helped force more than 2000 jewish 
men women and children to undress and walk into ditches where 
they were shot 
the 3rd circuit court had ruled that kungys made material 
misrepresentations when applying for entry into this country and 
when applying for citizenship 
kungys lawyers said the alleged lies mispresentations about 
his age and place of birth were not significant enough to cost 
him his citizenship 
government officials said kungys also lied about where he lived 
during world war ii in an effort to conceal his true identity 
justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor said in a 
dissenting opinion that they would uphold the 3rd circuit court 
ruling stripping kungys of his citizenship 
the case is kungys vs us 86228

marylands 1st congressional district seat 
was a hotbed of scandal and tragedy for democrats and republicans 
before the apparent suicide of the top aide to rep roy p dyson 
the incumbent 
the problems date to the tenure of former rep thomas johnson a 
twoterm democrat who was defeated in 1962 after being indicted 
for accepting money from the maryland savings and loan industry in 
exchange for his political influence after a series of legal 
challenges he went to prison in 1970 
johnsons successor rogers cb morton who later became 
republican national chairman represented the sprawling eastern 
shore district for five terms before resigning to accept an 
appointment as president richard m nixons secretary of the 
interior 
william o mills a republican elected in a special 1971 
election to fill the vacancy shot himself to death in 1973 amid 
news accounts that he failed to report a 25000 campaign 
contribution from the committee to reelect the president an 
undisclosed fund of nixons reelection finance committee 
newspaper reports at the time said morton made an unusual 
personal appeal to thenattorney general john mitchell for money to 
help finance the congressional campaign of mortons close friend 
mills but mills death and the deaths of three campaign managers 
in an automobile accident made it almost impossible to trace the 
cash contribution 
robert e bauman a leading conservative was elected in 1973 to 
replace mills but he was defeated in 1980 by dyson after being 
implicated in a sex scandal 
a charge that bauman solicited sex from a 16yearold male 
prostitute was dropped after bauman agreed to be counseled for 
alchoholism he later acknowledged his homosexuality publishing an 
autobiography in 1986 that detailed his marriage homosexual life 
and drinking problem his marriage was annulled in 1982

astrophysicist fang lizhi an outspoken critic of 
marxism in china published or edited five scientific works last 
year an authoritative weekly said today in a lengthy article 
chronicling fangs academic achievements 
writing and editing five books in one year is my record the 
beijing review quoted fang as saying it may be the result of my 
concentrated effort 
one of the books creation of cosmology was copublished 
with his wife li shuxian a physics teacher at beijing university 
where the couple live 
fang 52 was expelled from the communist party and fired from 
his job as vice president of the university of science and 
technology in anhui province in january 1987 after being accused of 
inciting students to stage prodemocracy demonstrations 
the official media however has stressed in several pieces on 
fang that he enjoys academic freedom at the beijing observatory 
where he has been working since last year 
since losing his university job for outspokenly advocating 
bourgeois liberalist views the beijing review said fang has 
achieved a great deal in his research work 
the article said fang was allowed to visit italy for the 12th 
time last summer for academic activities during which he reached 
an agreement with the italian foreign ministry to jointly build an 
international exchange center for astrophysics in beijing 
while in italy friends urged him to stay abroad but fang 
refused saying that as a scientist he had a social responsibility 
the weekly said 
it did not mention an interview fang gave to the west german 
magazine der spiegel while in rome in which he said that marxism 
is a thing of the past and that democracy that comes from above 
is no democracy it is nothing but a relaxation of control 
the beijing review quoted fang as saying that last years 
student demonstrations and chinese authorities ensuing campaign 
against bourgeois liberalization or western ideas at least made 
people think 
i havent done an allround deep study of chinas politics 
and economy i just speak my own mind he said 
he said the chinese people have high hopes in the communist 
party following a major party congress last fall in which leaders 
committed the party to longrange political and economic reforms

the efficiency of the nations businesses in 
churning out goods and services improved at an annual rate of 09 
percent in the first quarter of 1988 nearly reversing a 
deterioration of 1 percent in the last three months of 1987 the 
government said today 
despite an increase of nearly a million new jobs from january 
through march nonfarm businesses raised the total number of hours 
worked by only 17 percent while achieving a 27 percent increase 
in output 
and for the first time since late 1986 workers overall are 
keeping up with inflation the labor department said 
wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of 34 percent in 
the first quarter raising the labor costs associated with each 
service or product by 24 percent those labor costs had 
skyrocketed at an annual rate of 45 percent in the final quarter 
of 1987 on a massive employment surge 
however after taking inflation into account as measured by 
relative changes in total output and prices the wage gains 
yielded not a penny more of purchasing power 
the 09 percent improvement in productivity for nonfarm 
businesses which are responsible for about threefourths of the 
nations economic activity is only slightly ahead of the 08 
percent increase for all of 1987 
earlier figures had shown a 03 percent increase in the fourth 
quarter of last year but those were revised in todays report to a 
1 percent deterioration 
manufacturing which still accounts for about onefourth of the 
countrys gross national product continued to lead the effort in 
restoring us competitiveness 
manufacturers productivity increased at an annual rate of 29 
percent in the first quarter with a 43 percent increase in output 
on only a 13 percent increase in the number of hours worked in the 
nations factories 
for the first time since early 1986 factory workers actually 
kept ahead of inflation 
nominal wage gains averaging 39 percent annually in the first 
quarter the biggest jump in about three years increased the 
purchasing power of manufacturing employees by onehalf of 1 
percent after dropping 22 percent in 1987 
it also raised the labor costs associated with each item coming 
off the assembly lines by 1 percent compared with a nearly 2 
percent drop in labor costs in 1987

four senators who hold sway over nasa spending 
say they will not authorize a 700 million scheme to lease an 
unmanned robot space factory from the private developers who would 
build and own it 
in a letter to the national aeronautics and space 
administration the senators said that neither the reagan 
administration nor nasa has done the studies to justify such an 
expenditure they directed the space agency to contract with the 
national academy of sciences to undertake a thorough and 
independent review to be completed by next march 
president reagan proposed that the government agree in advance 
to lease 70 percent of the socalled commercially developed space 
facility at 140 million a year for five years 
the private facility would be carried into orbit by the space 
shuttle and revisited periodically by astronauts who would service 
the factory and bring back its products 
the committee feels that a 700 million budget commitment

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis called george bush a 
blank slate and urged him to speak out on breaches of law and 
ethics in the reagan administration jesse jackson talked today of 
a historical dimension of his campaign after spending the night 
at a union organizers home 
jackson in comments today in the cleveland suburb of berea 
ohio said hed stayed at the modest home of steelworker union 
organizer valentino fulimeni to bring attention to laborers who he 
said have been hurt by administration economic policies 
there simply are two dimensions to this campaign he said 
besides the race for the presidential nomination there is a 
historical dimension it is part of the thrust to open up the 
american political system the thrust to empower lockedout 
people 
one day earlier as dukakis was criticizing bush jackson made 
fun of dukakis saying the kitchen is clean and cool aint 
nothin cooking 
the two democratic rivals and bush the guaranteed republican 
nominee were campaigning today in ohio on the eve of the states 
primary the district of columbia and indiana have primaries the 
same day but ohio offers the biggest delegate prize 
dukakis at a day care center in a high school today complained 
that president reagan has failed to provide enough money for 
daycare programs and called on him to endorse legislation to 
expand federal funding for child care 
this is the kind of thing we need dukakis said of the 
cincinnati high school center we need to have it as a matter of 
national policy 
jackson who preached a pair of sunday sermons in cleveland 
vowed to turn up the heat on rival dukakis and he brushed 
aside surveys suggesting the massachusetts governor holds a nearly 
31 lead in ohio where 159 democratic delegates are at stake 
tuesday 
a poll conducted friday and saturday by the gallup organization 
showed dukakis with a 65 percent to 23 percent lead over jackson 
among democrats most likely to participate in the ohio primary 
results similar to two other polls all had potential margins of 
sampling error of about plus or minus 3 percentage points 
a poll published sunday in the akron beacon journal suggested 
dukakis had the support of 62 percent of registered democrats 
while jackson had 22 percent and 16 percent were undecided or 
supported other candidates 
another survey for the columbus dispatch had similar results 
64 percent for dukakis to jacksons 24 percent with 14 percent for 
others dukakis also picked up the support of the cleveland plain 
dealer ohios largest newspaper 
the current associated press delegate count puts dukakis at 
1277 and jackson at 852 but jackson professed optimism 
our campaign of hope continues jackson told backers our 
support base gets broader and bigger every day 
jackson was airing ads in ohio portraying himself as a candidate 
of change in contrast to bush and dukakis he implied that 
dukakis cautious style amounted to a lack of leadership 
the kitchen is clean and cool he said aint nothin 
cooking 
dukakis spent sunday sounding lawandorder themes visiting a 
police station in akron and stopping at toledos county jail and 
he hammered away at the reagan administration saying that under 
it rule of law and respect for the constitution have not been 
the order of the day 
in calling for tougher antidrug efforts dukakis cited the 
administrations history of dealings with panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega 
how can we tell our kids to say no to drugs when we have an 
administration that cant say no to drugs and drug dealers he 
said 
the massachusetts governor also suggested the administration 
could not effectively fight drugs with its top law enforcement 
official attorney general edwin meese iii embroiled in his own 
legal problems the attorney general is the subject of a nearly 
yearlong criminal investigation 
its got to begin at the top with a department of justice 
that knows what justice and rule of law is all about dukakis 
said in akron weve got an attorney general that should have 
left the office a long time ago and you know that and i know 
that 
later in cleveland dukakis said bush ought to air his views 
more fully on reagan administration policymaking and on 
controversial matters like meeses legal problems 
im not sure i can answer what that role has been frankly 
because hes such a blank slate one doesnt know i hope well 
learn as time goes on dukakis said 
democratic party chief paul kirk also criticized bush for not 
being sufficiently outraged to get involved in the meese matter 
there comes a time when personal cronyism must be replaced 
by a loyalty to public honor he said in an address at the 
university of notre dame 
bush said last week that if meese were found innocent of the 
allegations against him he would certainly hire him 
bush now has 1163 delegates according to the ap tally more 
than the 1139 delegates needed to nominate former television 
evangelist pat robertson is still technically a candidate but has 
just 42 delegates

state assemblyman tom hayden 
confronted some south vietnamese protesters outside his home with a 
baseball bat police said however a spokesman for hayden said the 
politician was carrying a bat because he was on his way to coach a 
little league baseball game 
no injuries were reported and no arrests were made saturday 
outside the home hayden shares with his wife actress jane fonda 
said santa monica police sgt walter hard miss fonda a twotime 
oscar winner is in mexico filming the movie old gringo with 
gregory peck and jimmy smits 
about 25 people most of them south vietnamese participated in 
the protest carrying signs and calling hayden a traitor and liar 
hard said 
some of them activated the intercom at his front gate and 
began chanting into it hard said it created a confrontation 
between the demonstrators and hayden who was carrying a baseball 
bat 
he came out swearing at the vietnamese said bob zirgulis of 
the international human rights watch which organized the protest 
we were completely stunned and taken aback that this 
politician would go berserk he actually went berserk zirgulis 
said 
hayden a baseball enthusiast was on his way to coach a little 
league game when he met the demonstrators on the sidewalk outside 
his home his spokesman bill schulz said sunday 
he said he chewed them out like los angeles dodgers coach 
tommy lasorda would have had they been banging on his gate 
schulz quoted hayden as saying 
haydens opponent in the june 7 primary alex cota was also at 
the demonstration which hayden accused cota of staging both are 
democrats on sunday schulz also termed the protest political 
shenanigans 
that is totally false cota responded sunday i did not 
organize the demonstration at all i came only as an observer after 
i heard about the demonstration 
the protest was staged to coincide with the 13th anniversary of 
the fall of south vietnam to the communists zirgulis said but the 
group also wanted hayden to apologize for past remarks they feel 
were insulting to the vietnamese he added 
those remarks were made by hayden in june 1987 about a 
usbased vietnamese gang whom he described as a bully element 
involved in shootings extortion and efforts to raise money to 
overthrow the hanoi government 
the santa monica democrat who is seeking his fifth term in the 
state assembly has often been a target of protests over his 
antiwar activities as has miss fonda 
hayden was one of the socalled chicago 7 who were convicted 
for their role in protests during the 1968 democratic national 
convention in chicago the convictions later were overturned 
he was elected to the state legislature in 1982

vietnam is asking for urgent assistance 
from the west because its staple crop rice is being ravaged by 
bad weather disease and insects 
top vietnamese government officials told representatives of 
foreign embassies and relief agencies on april 14 that these same 
problems had caused a shortfall of more than 16 million tons of 
foodgrain last year 
according to a western diplomat who attended the meeting in 
hanoi the vietnamese said there was a risk of famine in some 
provinces and that some villages in the northern part of the 
country hadnt had rice for weeks 
two days before the meeting vietnams official domestic radio 
said the first crop of 1988 was developing poorly because of lack 
of sunlight in the first three months twenty percent of the 
cultivated area can be rated poor radio hanoi said in a broadcast 
monitored in bangkok 
the broadcast said nearly 74130 acres were affected by insects 
and diseases and 247000 acres by root suffocation disease 
another 321100 acres lacked sufficient water and the water 
level of ponds lakes and reservoirs has dropped 65 to 195 feet 
compared with previous years it said 
storms and typhoons also are expected to take their annual heavy 
toll on crops after the rainy season arrives in a few months 
communistruled vietnam one of the worlds poorest nations 
annually suffers from a combination of stagnant food production and 
high population growth 
the new pragmatic leadership has stressed reforms based on 
material incentives to try to boost agricultural production 
western relief officials interviewed last year said there were 
no signs of starvation on any significant scale among the countrys 
63 million people but that there was widespread and serious 
malnutrition especially among children 
in the april 14 meeting the vietnamese asked for insecticide 
and fertilizer which the western diplomat estimated would cost 100 
million 
he said he doubted the international community would provide the 
full amount 
on april 26 khmer rouge guerrillas fighting vietnamese troops 
occupying cambodia said the west should exploit vietnams food 
plight by increasing pressure for a vietnamese pullout 
if aid is given it would be like a transfusion of fresh 
blood into the body of a bloodstarved vietnam writhing in its 
death throes thus reviving it and enabling it to carry on its war 
of aggression in cambodia a guerrilla radio broadcast said 
the khmer rouge the strongest of three antivietnamese 
guerrilla groups massacred millions of people when it ruled 
cambodia from 1975 until 1978 when the vietnamese invaded

the bureau of indian affairs concerned about 
the weak education its schools are delivering is asking indians 
how it should strengthen the instruction of their children 
a new report from the bureau documenting test scores worse than 
those of 79 percent of the nations students calls on tribal school 
boards councils and others to consider an improvement strategy 
emphasizing strong principals held accountable for results 
of the bureau districts what it calls agencies only one 
showed children scoring above the national median for their grade 
tribal leaders and school boards have had access to their own 
scores before but the new report commissioned by ross swimmer 
assistant interior secretary for indian affairs provides the first 
opportunity for one tribe or area to compare its standing with 
another said an interior department official who discussed the 
document on condition of anonymity 
the authors conceded that it will be difficult to install new 
leaders and revitalizing a system that appears too often to be 
going through the motions 
calling the system in dire need of improvment the report 
said it is no secret that bia education is today an organization 
lacking in a sense of direction 
its most productive members often feel that any successes they 
achieve occur despite the system rather than with its support 
collegiality the act of putting aside vested interests and 
working for the good of the whole is found in americas best 
educational institutions but is often missing in the bia system 
where administrators are sometimes more interested in shoring up 
and expanding their administrative domain 
drawing on research findings being promoted by the department of 
education the report said 
it is the principal above all who needs to insist on high 
standards of achievement for students and teachers and to 
communicate the firm expectation that these standards will be met 
some bia teachers seem to begin with the expectation that their 
students will do poorly 
the bureau educates 37917 indian students about 10 percent of 
the nations young indians and about as many pupils as the public 
schools of oklahoma city okla or corpus christi texas about 30 
percent attend boarding schools and about 30 percent are in schools 
run by tribes under contract with the bureau 
few of the students even approached national averages on 
standard tests administered in the 19851986 school year 
the highest scores appeared in new mexicos northern pueblo 
agency where 27 secondgraders averaged in the 52nd percentile 
this means they did better than 52 percent of all students taking 
the test 
the laguna agency also in new mexico showed an average in the 
46th percentile for its 63 secondgraders and schools not 
affiliated with an agency in the eastern states showed 73 
sixthgraders in the 49th percentile 
the worst scores were recorded in the chinle district of 
arizona where 202 fourthgraders and 154 fifthgraders mostly 
from rural navajo families wound up in the 7th percentile 
the report highlights some success stories but says the system 
needs a systematic way of spreading knowledge of successes to other 
areas 
for instance the dilcon and chuska boarding schools for navajo 
in the fort defiance ariz district use a special curriculum 
requiring students to write something every day their 
eighthgraders do well with dilcons two months ahead of the 
national average and chuskas a year above the bureau average 
though a year behind the nation 
because of the isolation of the schools administrative demands 
pay falling behind the public schools and other reasons the bureau 
system has an annual turnover rate of 33 percent per year among 
principals and 20 percent among all professionals 
among other recommendations the report calls for consideration 
of education loans for prospective teachers with a larger fraction 
forgiven the longer the teacher stays in the system for recruiting 
retired people with valuable knowledge who might like a second 
career and for easing the requirement that indians be given 
preference as principals

the panama canal is thriving despite 
antigovernment unrest and us pressure to oust strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega a canal official says 
business is almost embarrassingly high said richard a 
wainio chief of economic research and market development for the 
bilateral panama canal commission which runs the waterway linking 
the atlantic and pacific 
during the first five months of fiscal year 1988 toll revenues 
came to 1436 million exceeding estimated revenues by 46 
million wainio said in a recent interview 
the commission made up of five american and five panamanian 
government representatives was set up under a 1977 treaty that 
will turn the canal over to panama in 1999 
wainio said neither panama nor the united states wants to 
jeopardize canal operations 
but there is an impasse over canal revenues because the united 
states refuses to recognize noriegas rule and is trying to force 
him out as chief of panamas defense forces 
the united states has been withholding payments of about 18 
million in canal revenues from the noriega government ever since 
the general under indictment in us federal courts on 
drugtrafficking charges fired president eric arturo delvalle on 
feb 26 
in a thinly veiled coup noriega had the national legislature 
which he dominates oust delvalle one day after the president tried 
to fire the general the united states still recognizes delvalle as 
the legitimate president 
wainio said that canal expenses during the rest of 1988 are 
expected to wipe out any revenue surplus 
the treaty specifies that any surplus revenue up to 10 million 
annually during the life of the treaty be turned over to the 
panamanian government 
the united states paid panama nearly 79 million for use of the 
canal in fiscal 1987 payments in fiscal 1988 are expected to total 
80 million 
for now the reagan administration is depositing the payments in 
an escrow account in the united states 
the commission employs nearly 8000 people including 
panamanians and american citizens wainio said the employees have 
shown up for work regularly 
the canal has not been affected by violent antinoriega 
demonstrations that have rocked the rest of the country since june 
in march a twoweek general strike shut down much of the 
panamanian economy but it had no effect on the canal 
the panamanians are not going to take a chance of doing 
anything that would upset canal operations they will be taking 
over in 1999 wainio said 
wainio said that during the first five months of fiscal 1988 a 
total of 5017 vessels navigated through the canal compared with a 
projected figure 5061 
commodities especially grain and containerized cargo 
accounted for msot of the increase in cargo

a top federal health official says he hopes 
the surgeon generals coming declaration that nicotine is addictive 
will prompt the public to give cigarette smoking the same attention 
as heroin and cocaine use 
when we call this drug an addicting drug we have to take it 
more seriously than we currently do ronald m davis director of 
the federal office of smoking and health said sunday on cbstvs 
face the nation program we have to at least give it the 
serious attention that we do for the illicit drugs such as heroin 
cocaine etc 
davis said the report by surgeon general c everett koop will be 
issued in the next few weeks and will mark the first time a federal 
official with such a high rank will have declared nicotine 
addictive 
although not directly under koop in the department of health and 
human services organizational structure the office of smoking and 
health is among several federal agencies working at the direction 
of the surgeon general in developing material for the annual 
smoking report 
while there was no question davis is familiar with the contents 
of the report department officials expressed surprise that he 
discussed them in advance of the formal release tentatively 
scheduled may 16 
public health service spokesman jim brown said koop will not 
discuss the report in advance of its release 
walker merryman a spokesman for the tobacco institute said 
that daviss statements appear to be based on koops upcoming 
report which apparently he has seen we have not and do not 
intend to comment on something we have not seen 
davis did not specify what steps should be taken once koop 
issues his report but he questioned the way cigarettes are 
distributed 
why do we sell tobacco products in vending machines he 
asked we dont allow other addicting drugs to be sold in vending 
machines why do we allow free samples of the product to be sent 
through the mail or to be passed out on public property where kids 
and others have free access to them 
in the past surgeon generals reports on smoking have triggered 
both controversy and some strong actions and davis said he 
expected the same to occur this time 
what we saw with the last surgeon generals report in 1986 
which documented the health effects of passive smoking that 
passive smoking can cause lung cancer we saw that that accelerated 
the trend toward restricting or banning smoking in public places 
and in the work place davis said we would expect that this 
upcoming report would lead to serious consideration of what should 
be the appropriate public policies for this drug 
among the changes prompted by the 1986 report is the recently 
inaugurated ban on smoking on commercial airplane flights that last 
two hours or less 
weve been saying for many years now that nicotine is an 
addicting drug just like cocaine just like heroin and other 
drugs that people commonly accept as addicting he said but 
this report which will be released in a few weeks looks at the 
evidence in far greater detail than weve ever looked at before it 
compares this drug nicotine versus other drugs 
and we hope that once the public begins to understand that 
this is more than just a simple habit we will begin to take this 
behavior more seriously than we do davis said 
the lack of federal regulations on cigarettes is due to the 
historical social acceptability of smoking and probably the 
political influence of the tobacco industry davis said 
about 27 percent of the adult population smokes cigarettes 
compared with 42 percent in 1964 when the first surgeon generals 
report documenting health risk from smoking was released davis 
said

the united methodist governing conference today 
voted strongly to retain its rules forbidding ordination of 
selfavowed practicing homosexuals 
after an hourlong tense debate delegates voted 676 to 293 to 
maintain the restriction assailed by some as unfair and even 
unenforceable 
attorney john stumbo of topeka kans a delegate said the 
regulation was a legal nightmare in terms of provability since 
selfincrimination violates the concept of due process 
another lawyerdelegate scott williams of muncy pa argued 
however that the rule was essential and that many people owuld 
leave the church if it is not retained 
the action came shortly after the delegates also had voted 
overwhelmingly not to substitute a more liberal section about the 
ordained ministry 
several other questions related to homosexuality still were 
before the conference including a section of the church discipline 
calling the practice of homosexuality in compatible with 
christian teaching 
united methodists have struggled for 18 years with the status of 
homosexuals in the nations secondlargest protestant denomination 
delegates the issue the most important before their quadrennial 
governing conference 
an advance poll indicated threefourths of the 996 delegates 
oppose any easing of present restrictions 
but powerful national agencies of the denomination have urged 
modifications in disciplines condeming homosexual practice and 
barring active homosexuals from the clergy 
the issue reached a decisive stage on the seventh day of the 
11day conference which previously has been occupied in committee 
sessions with floor action now beginning 
the 96millionmember denomination larger than any protestant 
body in the country except for southern baptists first established 
standards against active homosexuality in 1972 following several 
years of debate 
controversy about the issue has gone on ever since including at 
the last three general conferences 
the sides are too polarized to find any common ground said 
the rev elliott wright of new york city 
at issue were three sections in the denominations book of 
discipline including 
a section on social principles terms homosexual persons of 
sacred worth entitled to church participation care and other 
human and civil rights but adds 
we do not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider 
this practice incompatible with christian teaching 
another section on the ordained ministry says clergy must uphold 
fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness adding 
since the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with 
christian teaching selfavowed practicing homosexuals are not to 
be accepted in the ordained ministry 
a section on administrative order bars use of any church funds 
for homosexual groups or to promote acceptance of homosexuality 
changes to modify or eliminate the various restrictions were 
sought by three denominational boards along with a womens 
commission and youth unit 
but the churchs bishops have urged maintenance of the present 
standards 
hundreds of petitions on one side or the other have poured in 
from regional and local church units and individuals 
bishop earl g hunt jr of lakeland fla outgoing president of 
the council of bishops says relaxing rules on homosexuality would 
lead to an angry exodus from the church he adds 
any legislation that opens the way for the acceptance of 
homosexuality as an alternate normal lifestyle within the 
christian community would be impossible for vast numbers of united 
methodists all over the world to accept 
representatives of a homosexual caucus affirmation said they 
had little hope of any change but wouldnt leave the church over 
it 
we are not surrendering the church to its most narrow and 
bigoted elements said morris floyd of minneapolis he told 
reporters sunday that heterosexism was behind discrimination 
against homosexuals 
meanwhile bishop f herbert skeete of philadelphia called the 
churchs plan to start a new university in africa one of the most 
exciting missional opportunities we have faced in years 
he said the church in africa stands on the threshold of a new 
and exciting time 
delegates voted overwhelmingly saturday to establish the 
university in zimbabwe with an initial funding of about 20 
million zimbabwe methodists have donated a 1000acre site for the 
project 
the denomination has 128 colleges and universities in the united 
states but the african institution will be the first one there 
an africa dream bishop emilio de carvalho of angola called 
the project saying the institutions design and leadership would 
be african

preconference briefing last week included machines that can arrange 
letters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way read 
zip codes and handle a variety of other tasks 
teaching machines to read handwriting for example is something 
technicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment to 
find and read zip codes and then print a bar code on the letter 
like those black lines used on supermarket items 
with the bar code already widely used by business mailers 
letters can be sorted more quickly 
other items under discussion will include laser equipment to 
help sort mail automatic truck loading equipment and robots to 
move mail containers and do other jobs 
on hand to see the american work and discuss developments in 
their own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries 
including australia canada west germany britain japan the 
soviet union switzerland and uruguay 
while these executives may long for highspeed mail sorters and 
cargo handlers the public face of technology will be embodied in 
infopost and autopost people accustomed to automatic banking 
machines will likely find the new machinery familiar 
infopost offers information on a televisiontype screen which 
the customer touches to enter questions it can respond either with 
an answer or with more questions 
asked about rates for overseas mail for example the machine 
can ask the weight of the item tell what types of things are 
allowed to be mailed to the country in question and give the rates 
and expected delivery time for various mail it also will print the 
information on a slip of paper if asked 
while infopost deals with just information autopost also 
using an interactive television screen is a mailing station 
it contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asks 
for the destination zip code with that information it outlines 
mailing options first class priority mail express mail or 
parcel post for example and tells the cost of each option and 
how long it is expected to take for delivery 
the customer can then feed coins bills or a bank cash card into 
the machine and it will make change and issue a postagemeterlike 
strip to be stuck on the letter or parcel it will also give a 
receipt if asked 
the item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox 
while infopost and autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbies 
of post offices eventually they could be extended to shopping 
malls supermarkets and other locations according to postal 
managers 
each will be connected to a central commuter which will monitor 
the supply of postage and change and call for a technician if 
problems develop the computer will sound an alert if someone tries 
to break into the machines 
the machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent of 
post office customer business the postal service estimates 
freeing clerks for more complex transactions

washingtononthebrazos texas ap a question of crass 
versus class has texans feuding over whether to hoist a flag and 
pole 13 stories high at the spot where the states forefathers 
declared independence from mexico in 1836 
the 325foot flagpole would fly a texas flag oneeighth the size 
of a football field over a local park the flagpole which 
purportedly would be the worlds largest would be about 245 feet 
shorter than the san jacinto monument near houston the dallas 
morning news reported 
edward smith a banker from nearby brenham wants to donate the 
flag and pole anyone that finds the texas flag crass and 
tasteless sure isnt much of a texan smith said at last weeks 
public hearing on the flagpole proposal 
historical purists say the pole and flag would destroy the 
dignity of the philadelphia of texas and create a carnival 
atmosphere at the park 
somehow the giant pole strikes me as more appropriate for six 
flags or astroworld texas aampm university professor don ivey said 
in a reference to theme parks at the spirited hearing 
gus sanders a businessman from nearby chappell hill also said 
he was opposed to the giant banner and pole 
you texans said the louisiana native certainly dont 
need to raise your flag any higher 
but some residents of this hamlet of washington which surrounds 
the scenic park that runs to the banks of the brazos river say the 
flagpole is a banner idea 
in the hearing conducted by the parks and wildlife department 
mrs arthur bushrer said the flagpole would be a boon to the 
tourist industry and added she was not bothered by claims it would 
reinforce the image of texans being insufferable braggarts 
everything about texas is big she said big as texas 
used to be something we were proud of we had big hats big cars 
big people we were big in heart and big in pride 
hal moorman president of washingtononthebrazos state park 
association argued that because of the states fiscal situation 
the donated flag may not be replaced when it wears out 
parks and wildlife department staff will make a recommendation 
to the agencys nine commissioners who are expected to deliver a 
decision may 12 
smith refuses to reveal the cost of the pole and flag but park 
officials estimated they cost at least 100000 
the record tallest flagpole 299 feet 7 inches was raised in 
san francisco during an international exposition in 1915 according 
to the guinness book of world records 
if the flag isnt raised at the park aggie professor ivey has 
another suggestion 
place it he said referring to the arch football rival 
several hundred miles to the north on an island in lake texoma 
where it would be visible from the university of oklahoma

irancontra figure oliver north today told 
graduates of the university founded by the rev jerry falwell that 
criminal charges against him are an honor and part of a legal 
battle he will win 
those accusations are not a brand they are an honor north 
told a cheering crowd gathered for his commencement speech at 
liberty university 
god willing with your prayers and support we will prevail 
even in washington north said a day after his retirement as a 
marine lieutenant colonel 
north lashed out at congressmen and a special prosecutor who 
have charged him with diverting money from an iranian arms deal to 
rebels seeking to overthrow nicaraguas marxist government 
we must not just choose the right president in 1988 north 
said we need a better congress 
in introducing north falwell an independent baptist preacher 
compared north to jesus christ after noting that journalists had 
asked him why he chose the indicted north as a commencement speaker 
we serve a savior who was indicted and convicted and 
crucified falwell told some 900 graduating students at the 
campus of nearly 8000 that is part of falwells religious empire 
in this central virginia city 
earlier a falwell spokesman said the evangelist probably would 
back north for public office 
he said last night to a reporter he would probably support him 
for any state office mark demoss a spokesman for the 
evangelist told reporters 
members of a group trying to draft north for a us senate 
campaign from virginia were among the thousands who showed up at 
liberty university to watch north make his first public statements 
since his indictment in the irancontra affair 
the chairman of the draft north for us senate committee jamey 
r wheeler declined to say whether north supports the effort 
he hasnt been telling us to stop and thats an encouraging 
sign wheeler said he would not say what the group would do if 
north did tell them to halt their drive 
north who testified before congress and later was indicted for 
his role in the reagan administrations mostpublicized scandal is 
a fine role model for young people de moss said earlier 
we wouldnt have him here if we thought he was a bad role 
model he said by and large this is a politically 
conservative school by and large we havent had much opposition 
the 8000student liberty university in this central virginia 
city is part of falwells religious empire falwell plans to 
present north with an honorary doctorate in the humanities 
norths speech today comes a day after his retirement as a 
marine lieutenant colonel

government 
about 60 people from four area peace activist groups carrying 
signs that read ollie not for president and real heroes dont 
lie demonstrated in downtown lynchburg against norths

our graduates would remember for a long time as their commencement

address at liberty last year

us arms sales abroad could jump by 33 
billion to more than 15 billion this year with much of the 
increase going to the middle east the new york times reported 
today 
but state department spokesman charles redman said the times 
report was misleading because a confidential report on which the 
story was based does not reflect anticipated sales he said it 
considers only sales which are eligible for approval during the 
calendar year 
since us law requires inclusion of all sales that might be 
approved many of which will not take place it would be wrong to 
characterize the report in any way as a sales plan or to attribute 
any significance to changes in dollar amounts from one year to 
another redman said 
the report cited by the times sent by the state department to 
congress lists potential sales to 33 countries israel would get 
36 billion worth of arms and egypt 27 billion the times said 
the request gives more attention to the persian gulf region than 
requests of previous years with the reagan administration asking 
for advanced arms and equipment for saudi arabia kuwait bahrain 
and the united arab emirates to counter threats from iran the 
newspaper said 
elsewhere one of the biggest possible purchasers is south 
korea with a potential 33 billion in arms the report said 
the president is required to submit an arms sale proposal to 
congress each year but the master list has rarely become public 
in the last fiscal year the united states delivered 117 
billion in military equipment and services to foreign governments 
and 2 billion more was sold directly by manufacturers according 
to the defense department arms sales abroad peaked in 1982 at 
177 billion 
egypt was the biggest gainer this year having bought 378 
million last year the times said most of that was in tanks it 
said 
israel would receive nearly 28 million worth of helicopters 
and f16 jet fighters under the proposal the newspaper said 
pakistan is listed as a potential buyer of 797 million in 
equipment this year compared with 138 million last year 
military sales to the philippines would decline to 45 million 
from 108 million according to the times

the court said a manufacturer does not always violate federal 
antitrust law when agreeing with one retailer to stop doing 
business with another who sells at discount prices

imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when 
it includes some agreement on price or price levels 
the case is business electronics corp vs sharp electronics 
corp 861910 
 
contemptofcourt 
 
the court ruled that federal lawyers procedurally botched a 
contemptofcourt case against a rhode island newspaper that 
published fbi information about a mafia boss 
by a 62 vote the justices said the procedural flaw must result 
in dismissing the governments appeal from a ruling that the 
providence journal was justified in defying a judges order barring 
publication of the material 
the case is us vs providence journal co 8765 
 
tax information 
 
the court agreed to hear a reagan administration appeal aimed at

by a 90 vote the justices upheld the conviction of a michigan 
man sentenced to a year in prison for possessing stolen videotapes 
the case is huddleston vs us 876 
 
securities

the supreme court said today a manufacturer 
does not always violate federal antitrust law when agreeing with 
one retailer to stop doing business with another who sells at 
discount prices 
the justices by a 62 vote said such a vertical restraint 
imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when 
it includes some agreement on price or price levels 
the decision a significant one for antitrust law is a victory 
for sharp electronics corp and a setback for a former houston 
retailer of sharp calculators 
business electronics corp owned and operated by kelton 
ehrensberger was the exclusive retailer of sharp calculators in 
houston from 1968 to 1972 
during that period sharp became dissatisfied with becs 
performance sharp contended that it was unhappy with becs failure 
to meet sales quotas but a federal jury found that sharp was 
dissatisfied with becs policy of selling calculators at prices 
lower than those suggested by sharp 
sharp in 1972 appointed hartwells office world as a second 
retailer of its calculators in houston and in 1973 terminated 
becs dealership hartwell had told sharp that it o the best possible job 
at 
home before expanding coverage elsewhere he said 
ingersoll who took over the family newspaper business when he 
was 27 has focused on buying newspapers and turning them around by 
modernizing and streamlining their operations and targeting their 
markets 
lean capable management is at the heart of all successful 
companies said ingersoll whose company has a 1988 revenue 
projection of 706 million with an operating cash flow of about 
180 million 
ingersoll said one of his corporate goals is to take advantage 
of opportunities in european countries and eventually to turn the 
company into an americanowned international publishing company

santa rosa calif a judge has barred the press from a hearing 
involving a custody fight between a couple and a surrogate mother 
saying the case was essentially a closeddoor adoption proceeding 
superior court judge lloyd von der mehden issued his ruling 
april 25 despite appeals by attorneys representing several san 
francisco bay area news organizations including the san francisco 
chronicle the santa rosa press democrat the marin independent 
journal and san francisco television station kron 
nancy barrass signed a contract in 1985 to bear a child for tim 
and charlotte myers of napa after being artificially inseminated 
with sperm provided by the husband she was paid 9000 when the 
boy was born in 1986 
barrass a novato resident says she had no intention of giving 
the couple full custody of the child she wants to be legally 
recognized as the boys mother and granted liberal visitation 
rights 
the case is more than just a normal adoption matter said 
robert faux one of the attorneys who want the hearing opened 
its important to have the facts and issues before the public 
because this is a whole field that has great importance to the 
public he said 
he also said secrecy was not needed because the names of all 
parties in the case are already known and have been mentioned in 
earlier news stories

brussels belgium five parties reached agreement monday on 
forming a new government which would end an impasse that began 
when the last coalition fell in a language dispute oct 19 
wilfried martens prime minister of the last government and now 
serving as caretaker also would lead the new coalition 
jeanluc dehaene a dutchspeaking christian democrat who spent 
more than four months negotiating an accord said he expected 
approval at meetings of the five parties thursday involved are the 
dutch and frenchspeaking wings of the socialists and christian 
democrats and the nationalist dutchspeaking volksunie 
keeping martens as head of the 35th belgian government since 
world war ii is the best guarantee for continued stability 
dehaene told reporters he said the coalition should be installed 
within three weeks 
it will continue the previous centerright administrations 
economic austerity program including tax reform and reductions in 
public spending he said 
the most immediate problems to which government policies must 
respond are those of employment and the budget he said 
the martens coalition dissolved oct 19 in a linguistic dispute 
between wings of both his christian democrats and conservative 
coalition parties from flanders the dutchspeaking northern half

if the fiveparty coalition comes together it will control 150 
seats well above the twothirds legislative majority needed for 
constitutional amendments that would increase regional autonomy in 
flanders and wallonia 
dehaene social affairs minister in the last government began 
negotiations with the five parties jan 22 after coalition talks by 
two socialist politicians failed 
belgiums population is split between 45 million people who

it has angie dickinson scripts a bobby 
vee sweater and a replica of the bubble machine that became a 
trademark of bandleader lawrence welk but the north dakota hall of 
fame despite years of effort is still short of the money it needs 
to display its exhibits to the public 
the hall conceived as a way of recognizing prominent north 
dakotans in fields of endeavor ranging from dairy production to 
sportswriting resembles nothing so much as the cluttered attic of 
an eccentric relative 
it takes up most of a columned office building north of the 
state capitol but its not officially open and a visitor is 
greeted by an expanse of empty floor space 
piles of logs stacks of bricks and bags of dried leaves rest in 
one corner a potbellied iron stove stands near an oldfashioned 
white porcelain sink 
a 1950sstyle malt shop booth and five welk bandstands painted 
with the strasburg natives lw script sit incongruously in the 
center of the main display floor 
most of the hall of fames possessions are locked in eight small 
rooms from plaques to books to a mannequin dressed in the uniform 
of former minnesota vikings standout dave osborn a lifesize 
cutout of welk holding his conductors baton stands next to the 
football player 
the whitesuited welk likeness was once stationed on the main 
floor said jim kennedy the halls executive director but it was 
moved into a room because when id come in here if it was a 
bit dark hed kind of startle me kennedy said it is pretty 
realistic looking 
also stashed away are a number of wax dummies some dressed in 
indian garb that once were the property of the defunct great 
plains museum near mandan 
kennedy and gary pearson a broadcast executive who first 
thought of the hall of fame idea five years ago concede its 
development has been slower than expected 
but pearson who has been meeting recently with a number of 
nonprofit groups in an attempt to obtain contributions said he 
remained optimistic 
were continuing to move except its taking us a little 
bit longer than we thought pearson said at this point we 
need to work harder at it we have been 
the hall has been adept at publicity organizing highprofile 
north dakota appearances by miss dickinson a native of kulm 
south of jamestown and former cbs news commentator eric sevareid 
who was born in velva several miles southeast of minot 
but promoters have been unable to translate the exposure into 
enough money to put the hall into shape pearson estimates it will 
take 200000 to 250000 to organize and staff it for a year 
so far the hall has raised 10000 through a car raffle and a 
small sum from selling memberships said kennedy 
we dont have very much money at all kennedy said last 
week were just squeaking 
once the hall is set up pearson believes it could draw as many 
as 90000 people annually paying a 2 entrance fee he said that 
is roughly half the number of vistors that the nearby state 
heritage center draws each year he said 
were not looking at any gigantic amount of money pearson 
said 
celebrities such as miss dickinson welk sevareid and pop 
singer vee who grew up in fargo are the highlights of the hall 
kennedy said however its primary goal is to spotlight north 
dakota groups such as the boy scouts civic club dignitaries and 
sporting organizations 
the celebrities hopefully are what will make people come in 
off the interstate kennedy said once theyre here they can 
enjoy the rest of it 
not too many are going to pull in just to see who the north 
dakota water user of the year is

us exports and japanese imports both boomed 
last year while the united states slowed the pace of its buying 
abroad and japanese sales actually declined the international 
monetary fund reported monday 
but the united states still bought 1737 billion worth of goods 
more than it sold up from 1698 billion the year before 
japans surplus dropped to 804 billion from 832 billion in 
1986 
dollar figures reflect the drop in the value of the us 
currency in terms of the yen as well as the actual amount of the 
goods traded this drop reduces the value of foreign sales and 
increases the cost of imports in japan and west germany the 
effect is the opposite imports are cheaper and sales bring in less 
money in terms of dollars 
the drop of the dollar was so large that it outweighed the 
increase of us exports in the final balance at the end of march 
the dollar was worth 865 percent less than it was 12 months 
earlier the fund calculates 
in terms of actual goods sold us exports rose 132 percent 
for the year against only 1 percent in 1986 imports still grew by 
22 percent but that was much less than the 109 percent of the 
year before 
japanese imports rose by 61 percent in the first nine months of 
1987 a considerable increase though less than the 128 percent of 
1986 exports dropped by 24 percent more than double the 1 
percent of 1986 
the fund calls these real adjustments in trade patterns but 
it notes that trade remains way out of balance 
west germany raised its imports by 52 percent somewhat less 
than the 59 percent increase the previous year but it also 
increased its foreign sales by 28 percent considerably more than 
the 09 percent rise in 1986 
the germans increased their trade surplus to 658 billion in 
1987 from 522 billion a year earlier 
taken as a whole the 21 countries that the fund calls 
industrial bought more than they sold to poorer areas 854 
billion worth up from 661 billion in 1986 neither the soviet 
union nor any other country with a communust government is included 
in this category 
for poorer countries the funds monthly imf memorandum 
emphasized the rise in prices paid by consumers 
inflation rose sharply in the developing countries in 1987 
led by a sharp acceleration of inflation in the western 
hemisphere it reported 
in the americas the rise was 1188 percent up from 822 in 
1986 but still below the 1614 rise in 1985 
the third worlds three biggest debtors also had the biggest 
price rises 2297 percent in brazil 1318 percent in mexico and 
1313 percent in argentina 
for the funds 130 poor countries inflation was put at 401 
percent compared with 293 percent in 1986 the rise was moderated 
by the record in asia where the rate was held to 69 percent up 
from only 54 percent in a year

ecology groups from a governmentsponsored environmental 
organization and the death of czechoslovak dissident pavel wonka in 
a czech jail last week the participant said 
sundays statement echoed most of the points introduced in the 
march 17 petition which called on the communist government to 
overcome hungarys current economic and social crisis by engaging 
in dialogue in good faith with representatives of hungarian 
society 
the statement also called for a multiparty parliamentary 
democracy in hungary 
the march document obtained by the associated press appealed 
for good neighborly relations with the soviet union but said 
hungary should remain a sovereign nation as well as an equal 
member of the european family of nations 
the petition has been signed by 726 people since it was issued 
in recent months the number of independent activist initiatives 
has mushroomed in hungary several of these groups have defied 
police warnings and continued to organize meetings 
the participant said the 50member network council would meet 
wednesday night to thrash out a position paper entitled there is 
a way out which reflects the networks views on how to solve 
hungarys current problems 
hungary is burdened by a gross hard currency debt of 16 
billion the highest per capita in the east bloc austerity 
measures introduced by the communist government this year have 
meant widespread belttightening for the countrys 106 million 
citizens

a congressmans top aide wrote a poem then 
leaped to his death from a luxury hotel the day a newspaper said he 
made unorthodox demands on male staffers personal time including 
that one perform a strip tease police said 
tom pappas 46 chief assistant to rep roy p dyson dmd 
fell 16 floors from his helmsley palace hotel room on sunday 
afternoon after discussing the effect of the washington post story 
with friends police said 
one friend said pappas was worried sunday morning that the 
article had irreparably damaged his career but didnt seem 
depressed 
dyson pappas and another aide were in new york to meet with a 
lawyer and attend the broadway musical phantom of the opera 
police said 
pappas left a poem on hotel stationery said a police spokesman 
lt stephen davis who would not reveal the contents he said the 
death appeared to be suicide 
pappas who had a room on the 24th floor landed on an 
eighthfloor ledge police said 
dyson and the second aide todd skipper had checked out by this 
morning said a hotel detective who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
today dysons office in washington which said it did not know 
his whereabouts issued a brief statement by dyson expressing 
sympathy to pappas friends and family 
tom was my friend and political ally for almost two decades 
dyson said all of us who had the privilege of working with him 
will miss him more than we can say 
in sundays frontpage story in the post dyson staffers said 
pappas had taken control of the office from the 39yearold 
democrat and that pappas pressured male staffers to socialize with 
pappas 
one staffer quit and another was fired after they refused to 
attend a private party dyson held at a maryland hotel suite last 
november the newspaper reported 
staffers told the post that pappas who was divorced told one 
male staffer he would have to perform a strip tease in 1987 at an 
office retreat in virginia the staffer refused the post said 
the article came as the federal election commission investigates 
allegations dysons campaign disclosure reports concealed 6650 in 
payments to pappas 
pappas who was paid 72200 as dysons administrative assistant 
last year also owns a company pappenbauer associates that 
received 119642 in fees and expenses since 1980 a revised dyson 
campaign report shows 
pappas helped engineer dysons first election to the maryland 
house of delegates in 1974 and his successful 1980 bid to unseat 
rep robert e bauman after the conservative republican was 
arrested for soliciting sex from a 16yearold male prostitute 
the charge later was dropped but bauman acknowledged he was 
homosexual and an alcoholic 
political consultant michael ford said he talked by phone with 
pappas about the post article for 25 minutes sunday morning pappas 
told ford he was worried that the article had irreparably damaged 
his career and had hurt dysons reelection chances the post 
reported today 
i told him youve done nothing illegal youve done nothing 
immoral and therefore i think you can deal with this ford said 
adding he didnt believe pappas was depressed 
pappas however felt in his own mind that it was a fait 
accompli that nothing could be done about it ford said 
those interviewed by the post said they did not believe that the 
pressure to socialize with pappas and others on the staff went 
beyond the dinners and events that pappas organized 
one press secretary scott ourth told the post he was hired 
with the requirement that he not date for a year when ourth began 
dating he called me the wayward son ourth recalled he 
told me youve lost the focus ourth quit six months after 
taking the job 
sundays article quoted a memo from pappas dated nov 14 as 
saying it is important for everyone on this staff to remember 
that tom pappas is the chief of staff responsible for everyones 
paycheck when he expresses a wish however slight it should be 
taken seriously 
a classified ad in the hannibal mo courierpost placed by 
pappenbauer associates offered salaries up to 50000 wanted a 
young man in a hurry it said asking are you single and 
willing to travel the ad asked for a writing sample and recent 
photograph 
former aides were quoted as saying pappas excluded female 
staffers from his social activities 
lawyers for the dyson campaign advised pappas not to talk to the 
post according to ford and joe trippi a campaign spokesman 
neighbors and former staff members told the post that dyson who 
is single frequently stayed at pappas large frame house in

crossbreeding between prairie chickens and 
grouse is common but one prairie chicken has taken things a step 
further by courting a brown pickup truck as the object of his 
affections 
he arrived at the jb and pat fischer ranch 23 miles south of 
here in late march and has stayed probably hoping he can convince 
the pickup to agree to a mixed marriage of sorts 
he likes my pickup fischer said he runs toward it 
whenever i drive across the meadow stamps his feet and performs 
his ritual for me i have seen a few grouse near where he stays 
but he tends to ignore them 
prairie chickens boom and grouse dance as they gather 
for their spring courtship rituals which are common to both 
species and are similar prairie chickens inflate large orange air 
sacs on their neck erect tufts of neck feathers and produce a deep 
resonant boom that can be heard for nearly a mile in calm 
weather

when the halls of woodland park 
junior high became a little too gnarly for principal charles 
lutgen he thought it was time students gave him a lesson in the 
slang of the day 
id hear things he said and id think gosh is that 
good or bad or indifferent 
the principal found his answer in slang struck a handbook for 
parents to better understand what were talking about a 
137word studentcompiled guide 
the idea for the handbook came from english teacher lynn 
heintzman encouraged by the principal she tacked a piece of 
poster board on the classroom wall and invited students to write in 
and keep it clean 
included in the handbook are such terms as babe nicelooking 
stud muffin nicelooking male majorly very very important 
sweetness special and gnarly cool 
but the new handbook is in danger of obsolescence already some 
of the words in slang struck already have different meanings

marketing campaign 
sunglasses are being added to the popular logo on the tails of 
jets serving california routes company officials announced sunday 
flight crews and ground workers also are to wear shades until the

the day after the march 15 presidential primary in 
illinois massachusetts gov michael dukakis hustled home for a 
meeting on a thorny state subject furloughs for firstdegree 
murderers 
lt gov evelyn murphy attended the closeddoor meeting of the 
anticrime council and when dukakis realized that it was the first 
time his potential successor had attended the toplevel monthly 
gathering he made her a permanent council member on the spot 
dukakis slowly has brought his lieutenant governor closer to the 
center of state government as his chances of winning the democratic 
presidential nomination have improved 
as that has happened advocates lobbyists and interest groups 
have begun seeking out the first woman to hold statewide office in 
massachusetts history 
there have been people coming into my office since early last 
year wanting to sort of talk about the what ifs murphy said in 
an interview ive carefully stayed away from that because it 
seemed to me the most important thing i can do for him is to stay 
focused on the day to day managing of this state 
she still does not meet regularly with dukakis weekly meetings 
are scheduled to begin later this month and she has performed 
largely ceremonial duties as lieutenant governor other than 
lobbying for administration priorities and sitting on boards such 
as the local government advisory council 
the agreement has been that the governor will set the policy 
and evelyn will help us execute it just like the rest of us said 
dukakis chief secretary hale champion 
only if dukakis wins the nomination champion said would murphy 
be brought inside the administration 
dukakis has said he has no intention of yielding office unless 
he wins in november and even then he said he might not step down 
as governor until he is inaugurated as presient 
nobody asked john kennedy to resign from the senate nobody 
has asked george bush to resign the vice presidency he said 
recently 
despite her two stints as a dukakis cabinet secretary some 
distance remains between the states two top elected officials 
in 1986 dukakis operatives worked behind the scenes in an 
unsuccessful effort to block murphys nomination for the lieutenant 
governorship at the 1986 state convention dukakis aides leaked 
the story that murphy was a political traitor after dukakis defeat 
in 1978 by trying to stay on in the administration of political 
archrival ed king 
in 1982 murphy won no friends in the dukakis camp when she 
remained neutral in dukakis successful comeback bid against king 
today she says her role remains limited because it allows 
dukakis to demonstrate leadership at home but it also leaves her 
politically vulnerable should she inherit the governorship to 
fiscal decisions the dukakis administration makes now 
it is for him a very important aspect of his campaign 
nationally to be able to show people throughout the country as the 
governor of this state and as a political candidate and as a 
political leader what he can do murphy said 
as the states fiscal picture has tightened recently murphy has 
taken an increasing interest in planning the state budget that will 
carry into next year beyond the presidential inauguration by 
june murphy said she will present dukakis her budget analysis and 
outline possible disagreements with the governors plan 
from the day the governor set off to be president over a year 
ago now hale champion and i have been meeting daily building up 
the agenda of discussion murphy said 
murphy 47 served as dukakis secretary of environmental 
affairs in his first term and as secretary of economics early in 
his second term she holds a doctorate in economics from duke 
university 
as is the case with any lieutenant governor or even the vice 
president murphy has few official duties she has spent her time 
on a project called blueprint 2000 a program to map out the 
states future in areas such as transportation and economics

romance romance is a hit and a miss 
the show which opened sunday at the helen hayes theater is 
made up of two oneact musicals a form of song and dance rarely 
seen on broadway jerry bock and sheldon harnick tried it more than 
20 years ago with the apple tree musical versions of short 
stories by mark twain jules feiffer and frank r stockton they 
had varying degrees of success 
so do the creators of romance romance barry harman who 
supplied the book lyrics and direction and keith herrmann who 
wrote the music have gone to a short story by arthur schnitzler 
and a play by jules renard for their double bill 
its the curtain raiser the little comedy that proves to 
be the more agreeable the witty schnitzler short story set in 
turnofthecentury vienna adapts well to the stage the tale is 
told in the form of letters to old friends the format is not as 
confining as one might think because the missives are acted out by 
the two main characters 
the letter writers alfred and josefine are bored jaded 
members of the viennese upper crust they toss away lovers like 
yesterdays strudel for a little excitement the two of them go 
slumming and meet in a park he pretends to be a penniless poet 
she becomes a poor shopgirl poverty attracts at least for a while 
reality finally sets in and both are relieved to discover they 
are from the same wealthy social set the two lovers will get 
married but dont expect the union to last they both say at the 
fadeout 
harman keeps the slender story spinning and although his rhymes 
are often predictable they at least illuminate the characters or 
advance the tightly focused plot herrmanns music has the 
appropriate old world charm especially a lilting title song the 
little comedy is a crisp confection topped with just the right 
amount of sour cream 
but things turn soggy in act 2 a moist little musical called 
summer share the locale is a trendy hamptons beach house 
shared by two married couples monica is sams best friend even 
though they are married to other people so how long will it be 
before they have an affair well they think about it for a long 
time so do their mates and so does the audience left squirming 
while the two wouldbe lovers make up their minds 
the characters are sketched so skimpily that its impossible to 
work up interest in any of them especially after they keep 
insisting how wonderful their marriages are 
although summer share claims to be the more modern of the 
two shows it is also the more sentimental and shopworn the 
evening ends with the characters urging theatergoers to cherish 
your romantic notions 
scott bakula is an ingratiating handsome leading man hes 
rakish and debonair in the first musical pensive and appealing in 
the second as the unrepentant coquette alison fraser is 
perfection in the first act but the sappy material defeats her in 
the second musical deborah graham and robert hoshour are properly 
morose as the leftout spouses in act 2 
steven rubins modest settings are in keeping with the modest 
tone of the whole evening while steven jones costumes capture the 
spirit of both eras 
the musicals originally done last fall at a tiny 
offoffbroadway theater have undergone some reworking in their 
transfers to the larger helen hayes summer share received the 
biggest rehab but the fixing didnt do much good 
romance romance offers two looks at love one lively the 
other leaden stay until intermission and youll have an 
entertaining time 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what other critics said 
in the new york times walter goodman said romance romance 
lately the littlest musical offoffbroadway has made it uptown 
in a slightly enhanced production that loses nothing of the charm 
and intelligence of the original in a broadway season so full 
of pretentiousness this show is delightfully small scale 
howard kissel in the daily news wrote for all its virtues 
romance romance is a show that keeps you at a distance 
ultimately the material is arch and clever you dont feel youre 
rediscovering simple affection rather you feel youre being let 
in on a joke 
in the new york post clive barnes said just as the evening 
is a pair of sketches the shows joys and disappointments are 
mixed barnes praised the two leads scott bakula and alison 
fraser but added the sad thing is that the musical or at 
least the music doesnt really support them

the united states on monday urged the polish 
government to negotiate with its labor unions and to refrain from 
using force against striking workers 
the current strikes in poland demonstrate more clearly than 
ever that successful economic reform and recovery require genuine 
dialogue between the government and society state department 
spokesman charles redman said in our view such dialogue must 
allow for the expression of working peoples concerns and rights 
redman added that the use of force cannot contribute to 
national reconciliation 
the solidarity trade union movement complained of exceptional 
brutality by police in clashes with protesters sunday in poland 
thousands of polish workers are striking to back demands for 
increased pay to offset price hikes of 42 percent caused by the 
governments austerity program the weeklong work stoppages are 
described as the worst labor unrest in poland since the communist 
government suspended solidarity in december 1981 
redman said the united states supports the polish governments 
economic reform program and is willing to help in its 
implementation but he added that such help is feasible only if 
the difficult economic changes needed are supported by a broad 
spectrum of polish society 
the reforms that began in 1986 have included a thinning of the 
government bureaucracy and encouragement of private enterprise 
one us official said the reagan administration was willing to 
help poland if agreement is reached between the government and 
the unions by supporting its loan requests to the world bank and 
the international monetary fund 
poland owes some 40 billion the largest chunk to west germany 
and a significant sum to the united states the official said 
the united states which is the largest contributor to both 
institutions would be willing to support loan programs if poland 
is serious about future reforms said the official who spoke 
only on condition he not be named 
the united states improved its ties with poland after the polish 
government released all political prisoners at the end of 1986 
cultural and economic ties were restored and both countries 
exchanged ambassadors in march

we want someone who would be representative of the colonial 
power who would have authority to commit the colonial power 
hnalaine uregei a member of the fronts political bureau told a 
news conference 
he said the proposal from the three officials was at the same 
time grotesque ridiculous and indecent and said they knew it 
would not be taken seriously

election between socialist president francois mitterrand who urges 
dialogue with the separatists and chirac who calls them a small 
band of terrorists

american jewish leaders said monday they will 
hold a religious service and a vigil in helsinki finland before 
the moscow summit as a way of drawing attention to the plight of 
soviet jews 
the events organized by the national conference on soviet 
jewry will take place may 2728 while president reagan is in 
finland 
reagan who is scheduled to fly to moscow on may 29 for the 
threeday summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has been 
invited to the friday night service at the helsinki synagogue 
organizers said they did not know if he would attend 
morris b abram chairman of the national conference told 
reporters the activities in helsinki are designed to impress upon 
soviet leaders the conferences commitment to seeing soviet jews 
accorded more freedom 
he said his group will continue the campaign to free soviet 
jewry so they can emigrate and to permit those who wish to 
remain to live as jews without any limitations and without any 
discrimination against them 
the conference estimates that as many as 400000 jews are 
seeking to leave the soviet union but have been denied exit 
permits there are more than 2 million jews in the soviet union 
which has about onefifth of the worlds jewish population 
jews have been persecuted for practicing their faith in the 
statecontrolled society and are often discriminated against 
soviet jews are planning an event in moscow during the summit 
but conference officials refused to provide details fearing 
organizers might be subjected to harassment by soviet officials 
when gorbachev visited washington for a summit last december 
supporters of soviet jews staged a massive demonstration near the 
white house vice president george bush attended that rally 
abram and richard maass head of the conferences moscow task 
force also said they want the soviet union to abide by the 1975 
helsinki final act that proclaimed that people have a right to 
leave a country freely 
gorbachev and other soviet officials have voiced irritation at 
the attention the united states focuses on human rights in recent 
speeches reagan has urged the soviets to allow more freedom of 
speech and religion and his aides say he will revisit that subject 
in a talk wednesday in chicago 
the conference will hold a daylong summit action day for 
soviet jews tuesday in washington where secretary of state 
george p shultz is to speak 
also attending will be joseph begun a mathematician who was 
allowed to emigrate in january after spending many years in soviet 
labor camps 
the american jews say that under gorbachev the treatment of 
soviet jews has been mixed on the one hand there has been some 
improvement in cultural life such as the creation of a hebrew 
study group in one region 
but the number of jews allowed to emigrate is still a trickle 
compared with the 1970s and some emigration laws have been 
tightened

israel closed a palestinian weekly today 
charging it was funded by terrorist groups and a palestinian 
teenager was electrocuted while climbing on a utility pole with an 
outlawed palestinian flag 
this afternoon nbc news reported israeli troops mounted a major 
offensive into lebanon pushing more than five miles into the bekaa 
valley in pursuit of palestinian guerrillas beirut radio stations 
carried no reports of any such troop movement 
the interior ministry shut down the jerusalembased al awdah a 
weekly published in english and arabic determining it was a tool 
for terror organizations according to ministry spokeswoman tova 
elinson 
the closure order was delivered today to magazine editor ibrahim 
kareen who also heads the palestine press service 
the press service was a key source of information on the 
occupied territories before it was banned for six months beginning 
march 30 it has maintained contacts with foreign journalists 
israeli officials have padlocked several arab news organizations 
since unrest erupted in the occupied territories five months ago 
they contend the organizations have helped fuel arab riots 
kareen denied al awdah received funding from terror groups he 
said money to run the magazine came from subscribers 
this was a political decision kareen said maltreatment 
of journalists has become government policy 
kareen said al awdah which was founded six years ago and has a 
combined circulation of about 10000 was the first palestinian 
publication to interview israelis facetoface in an effort to 
promote dialogue 
now the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier 
kareen said the occupier will harass the occupied will resist 
and dreams of having a dialogue seem the product of naivete 
in a related development the supreme court heard an appeal from 
the israeli editor of a leftwing newspaper who was arrested five 
days ago and has been denied a meeting with her lawyer 
michal schwartz was one of three israeli editors of the proarab 
derech hanitzotz who were arrested for security offenses over the 
past few weeks 
the newspaper was shut down in february on charges of being 
connected to the democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
a syrianbacked palestinian faction led by nayef hawatmeh 
state prosecutor malhiel ballas argued ms schwartz lawyer was 
likely to leak to the public details of the secret investigation if 
she saw her client 
in the west bank city of nablus nidal abdulhak 16 from the 
village of beit wazan died sunday night in nablus al ittihad 
hospital the army said 
hospital officials quoted family members as saying he was 
electrocuted when he was ordered to remove a palestinian flag from 
a utility pole the army said he apparently was killed while 
hanging a flag

members of a congressional committee scolded 
the chairman of the securities and exchange commission on monday 
for failing to require that companies establish tougher auditing 
procedures 
such a recommendation was among several made last october by a 
private task force headed by former sec commissioner james treadway 
the treadway commission proposed that the sec require publicly 
traded companies to have independent audit committees composed of 
people from outside the corporation to doublecheck financial 
statements the new york stock exchange already requires companies 
it lists to have such committees 
the sec however has decided to only urge the nations 
financial markets and other industry groups that oversee securities 
trading to consider upgrading and expanding the scope of their 
standards with respect to audit committees sec chairman david s 
ruder told the house energy and commerce oversight and 
investigations subcommittee 
subcommittee chairman john d dingell dmich noted that the 
treadway commission had concluded that fraudulent financial 
reporting was a major problem and should be addressed by the 
government 
somebodys got to do something to see to it that we have 
confidence in our system dingell told ruder one of the 
reasons the securities and exchange commission is drawing pay is 
to do that 
another subcommittee member rep ron wyden dore said he was 
amazed that the sec plans to pass the buck to others 
ruder said sec officials were wary of imposing the requirement 
because of a fear that it would be too costly for small businesses 
however he added there had been strong disagreement among 
the secs commissioners over implementing the proposal he said he 
himself favored the idea and believed that a mechanism could be 
worked out to reduce the burden on small companies

a new wing of a childrens hospital 
collapsed monday in kashmir and at least 14 people died in a crush 
of bricks and concrete dozens of children their moans growing 
fainter were feared trapped 
there are fewer and fewer signs of life one official said 
rescuers were pumping oxygen and drinking water through the debris 
in hopes of sustaining any survivors 
the threestory building disintegrated shortly after sunrise in 
jammu winter capital of the northern state of kashmir 
the wing completed in 1985 had been lined with cracks an 
older wing remained standing 
more than 16 hours after the building came tumbling down indian 
army rescue teams were trying to remove the debris by hand and with 
cranes but hopes were fading some rescuers pulled severed limbs 
from the wreckage 
i heard children moaning in the morning but in late evening 
there was nothing a kind of strange silence amid the noise of 
rescue work said kashmir times reporter arun joshi they may 
be dying 
by evening 14 bodies and 29 survivors had been found some news 
reports placed the death toll as high as 30 
but the worst is yet to come at least 50 children and their 
parents or attendants are trapped on the first floor joshi said 
in a telephone call to new delhi it is a terrible sight up 
here 
joshi said a total of at least 75 children and their parents or 
attendants were caught in the hospital 
a police spokesman in jammu 340 miles north of new delhi said 
the collapse was caused by a weak foundation in the new wing of the 
hospital 
the entire new wing has come down much of it has just gone 
inside the earth spokesman satish gupta said 
the government ordered an investigation and three civil 
engineers who were responsible for construction were suspended 
gupta said it will take at least 24 hours to remove the debris 
until then it is all guesswork but we fear the toll will go 
up he said 
the new wing which housed three wards collapsed at 630 am 
joshi said the wing contained 51 beds but some were shared by two 
children 
i saw limbs of children being recovered from the debris the 
death toll is likely to go up unless by providence the children are 
saved said joshi 
joshi said there had been cracks in the ground floor walls he 
said a doctor told him the cracks widened sunday and that he 
evacuated 35 children 
jammu with a population of 500000 is the second largest city

washington ap the supreme court in an antitrust ruling that 
could make bargainhunting more difficult said monday that 
manufacturers do not always act illegally when they agree with 
retailers to stop supplying discount stores 
by a 62 vote the court said such action by a manufacturer 
becomes illegal only when it includes some agreement on price or 
price levels 
the ruling makes it easier for manufacturers to avoid antitrust 
liability when acting on requests from competing retailers they 
stop doing business with stores that cut prices 
at the margin this can make life harder for discounters 
said diane p wood an antitrust professor at the university of 
chicago law school 
noting that bills pending in congress would outlaw such tactics 
by manufacturers she said the legislation reflects a fear that 
discounters could go out of business or find it harder to get 
merchandise without such protection 
in other action monday the court 
ordered further hearings to determine whether a new jersey man 
accused of helping nazis kill more than 2000 jews in lithuania 
should be stripped of his us citizenship 
ruled that a procedural miscue by federal lawyers must result 
in dismissing the governments contemptofcourt prosecution 
against a rhode island newspaper that published fbi information 
about a mafia boss 
agreed to consider a case from washington state that makes it 
easier for the federal government to turn over us tax information 
to a foreign government 
refused to let connecticut police subject all people who attend 
ku klux klan rallies to patdown searches for weapons the justices 
let stand rulings that such searches violated individuals privacy 
rights 
the courts antitrust decision is a victory for sharp 
electronics corp and a setback for a former houston retailer of 
sharp calculators 
business electronics corp owned and operated by kelton 
ehrensberger was the exclusive retailer of sharp calculators in 
houston from 1968 to 1972 during that period sharp became 
dissatisfied with becs performance sharp contended it was unhappy 
with becs failure to meet sales quotas 
but a federal jury found that sharp was dissatisfied with becs 
policy of selling calculators at prices lower than those suggested 
by sharp 
sharp in 1972 appointed hartwells office world as a second 
retailer of its calculators in houston and in 1973 terminated 
becs dealership hartwell had told sharp it would quit 
distributing its products unless sharp ended its relationship with 
bec 
bec then sued sharp and a federal jury awarded bec 600000 in 
damages under federal antitrust law that amount was tripled to 
18 million 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals however threw out the 
jury verdict and sent the case back for a new trial mondays 
decision upheld the appeals court ruling 
writing for the high court justice antonin scalia said the 
trial judge erred in telling the jury it could rule against sharp 
if it found that bec was terminated to reduce price competition in 
the houston retail market 
there has been no showing here that an agreement between a 
manufacturer and a dealer to terminate a price cutter without a 
further agreement on the price or price levels to be charged by the 
remaining dealer almost always tends to restrict competition and 
reduce output scalia said 
a vertical restraint one imposed by a manufacturer on a 
retailer is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement 
on price or price levels he said 
if the sharphartwell agreement had included a price level at 
which sharps calculators had to be sold however the agreement 
could have been ruled illegal automatically 
nothing in mondays ruling bars a manufacturer acting by itself 
from continuing to tell retailers that its products must be sold at 
certain prices the legislation pending in congress would outlaw 
even those pricing tactics 
scalia was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and sandra day oconnor 
justices john paul stevens and byron r white dissented in a 
23page opinion authored by stevens and justice anthony m kennedy 
did not participate in the case

the agency for international development 
doesnt pay enough attention to women in the third world despite 
their roles in farming and other areas of commerce two studies say 
reacting to the independent studies members of congress have 
introduced a bill they say would redress the situation by requiring 
the aid office that oversees women in developing nations to spend 
10 million annually last year the office spent about 2 million 
the bill introduced by democratic reps mickey leland of texas 
and pat schroeder of colorado in one chamber and sen barbara 
mikulski of maryland in the other also would order aid to place 
women in 50 percent of positions in training programs abroad 
much has been said and written about incorporating women in 
development efforts but far too little has been done schroeder 
and leland said in a joint letter to colleagues 
the bill which has 89 cosponsors in the house is being 
promoted by bread for the world a christian group that lobbies 
against hunger and poverty 
that group plans a letterwriting campaign to encourage aid to 
increase benefits given to women in developing countries said 
president art simon the brother of sen paul simon dill 
aid opposes the bill even though alan woods the agencys new 
director is committed to aids efforts to integrate women into 
developing economies spokesman jerry lipson said 
although the agency believes more needs to be done for women in 
developing countries the legislation would create an additional 
layer of bureaucracy and cut down on aids flexibility he said 
agency officials think the legislation is like using an 
elephant to deal with a fly he said 
moreover he said that while americans recognize the importance 
of women in the third world aid officials sometimes run into 
roadblocks in developing countries where women frequently have 
inferior status 
what prompted congressional interest were two independent 
studies commissioned by aid and completed in 1987 that said aid 
programs often are inattentive to women 
aids women in development policy is not being implemented 
fully or vigorously and there is little enthusiasm and few 
incentives for doing so development associates inc a 
consulting group wrote in a december report 
unless there is agencywide acceptance of the policy of 
incorporating women it will be marginally useful at best the 
study said 
while lipservice is given to the importance of womens roles in 
development the policy is not a serious concern for many aid 
managers the study said 
numerous studies have demonstrated the vital role women play in 
a developing nations economy 
in africa for instace it is estimated that women are 
responsible for growing more than 80 percent of the food consumed 
in the home 
case studies in botswana kenya and the caribbean for example 
show that when there is widespread male migration womens earnings 
are the mainstay for subsistence expenditures 
women also play a large role in informal commerce serving as 
traders and merchants in countries like nigeria and ghana in a 
community in bolivia womens earning from handicrafts tided 
families over during a drought 
the failure to take women into account can undermine some 
development projects according to a report written by alice 
carloni for aid in april 1987 
the botswana agricultural college expansion project was rated 
highly successful in developing an agricultural training 
institution 
but the project may not ultimately improve the lives of farm 
families if the extension service continues to bypass female 
farmers who play a major role in agriculture the study said 
in another project in nepal architects focused too narrowly on 
the domestic role women play the study said the women were taught 
to use a different type of stove designed to reduce deforestation 
but were not educated on broader conservation topics

president roh taewoo replaced the 
head of the governing party with a moderate monday and was expected 
to reshuffle his cabinet after the opposition took control of the 
national assembly 
in a speech monday roh adopted a conciliatory attitude to the 
opposition which won parliamentary elections april 26 
government officials said roh would reshuffle his cabinet and 
replace rightists with moderates 
hardliners and those with military background are not 
considered for nomination said one source speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
police meanwhile stopped opposition activists from circulating 
a petition calling for an investigation of former president chun 
doohwan 
roh nominated moderate yun giljung 71 to head the democratic 
justice party and replce chae moonshik other senior party 
officials appointed later in the day were all moderates 
opposition candidates made a surprisingly strong showing in the 
national assembly elections depriving the rohs party of its 
majority for the first time in south koreas 40year history 
we lost the elections but we have not lost our fair and just 
attitude we have no regrets about holding fair elections roh 
told a meeting of party officials 
roh said the oppositiondominated national assembly would pose a 
serious problem but his party should tackle it under the principle 
of dialogue and compromise 
opposition leader kim daejung whose party for peace and 
democracy emerged as the largest opposition party on monday called 
for a parliamentary investigation into past wrongdoings under 
expresident chun 
kim 62 demanded that the national assembly probe alleged 
corruption involving chun and and his family and a 1980 
antigovernment uprising in the southern city of kwangju during 
which nearly 200 people were killed 
but kim said the investigation could be delayed if it would 
affect a successful staging of the olympic games in seoul in 
september 
chun whose term ended feb 24 has come under fire for alleged 
involvement in largescale financial scandals his younger brother 
chun kyunghwan was arrested in march on charges of embezzling 
official funds 
opposition politicians are pushing a petition drive to collect 1 
million signatures to demand the former president be subpoenaed for 
investigation about 300000 signatures have been collected they 
said 
but police monday banned collection of signatures in the streets 
for the petition no official reason was given for the action 
kim said he would support a probe of chuns alleged financial 
wrongdoings but opposed putting him on trial because he was a 
president 
aides said kim would once again be appointed to lead his party 
at a convention scheduled for saturday he resigned the party 
presidency two months ago to help unite the divided opposition 
kim daejung emerged from the elections in a far stronger 
postion than rival opposition leader kim youngsam both kims ran 
for president against roh and split the opposition ticket allowing 
roh to win

orders to us factories registered a 
surprising 16 percent upward surge in march as strong export 
demand and heavy defense orders reversed weakness in the previous 
two months the government reported monday 
the commerce department said that orders for durable and 
nondurable goods climbed to 21608 billion an increase of 343 
billion from the february level 
the 16 percent advance was the first increase this year after 
orders had shown no improvement in february and actually fell 06 
percent in january following a 2 percent december gain 
analysts had expected a much smaller march advance of around 03 
percent they said the report showed demand was rebounding 
following a brief period when businesses cut back to work down a 
high backlog of unsold goods 
at the beginning of the year economists had been so worried 
about the big rise in inventories that they were forecasting order 
cutbacks and job layoffs could topple the country into a recession 
but the orders report on monday following strong employment 
gains and big rises in consumer spending showed that the economy 
regained its footing in the early part of this year 
it is clear that we have a stronger economy than people had 
been expecting the crash had much less effect than people had 
feared said david wyss an economist with data resources inc 
the government reported last week that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product rose at a healthy 23 
percent annual rate from january through march far better than the 
recession many had predicted 
wyss said dri had boosted its economic forecast for the entire 
year to show growth of 28 percent very close to the 
administrations prediction of 29 percent gnp growth this year 
charles renfro chief economist of alphametrics corp a 
forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa said manufacturing orders 
should continue growing as stronger growth in europe and the weaker 
dollar boosts export demand even more the administration is 
counting on rising export demand to account for nearly half of all 
gnp growth this year 
we are still a very important hightechnology economy 
producing goods that the world needs and the strength in orders 
reflects that renfro said 
the march increase was particularly surprising in view of the 
fact that only 10 days ago the government had reported that orders 
for durable goods items expected to last more than three years 
were unchanged in march in mondays report that was revised to 
show a healthy 1 percent gain in durable goods reflecting 
newfound strength in machinery steel and transportation 
orders for nondurable goods climbed at an even faster pace 
rising by 23 percent to 1006 billion 
the overall increase of 16 percent reflected a big 174 percent 
jump in demand for military equipment following a 6 percent drop 
in this volatile category in february 
without the rise in military orders total orders would have 
climbed a smaller 1 percent still the sixth gain in nondefense 
orders in the past seven months 
the key category of nondefense capital goods fell 38 percent 
to 325 billion but analysts discounted the setback and said they 
were still looking for strength as businesses boost spending to 
expand production facilities to meet rising demand 
orders for transportation equipment climbed 34 percent while 
orders for primary metals such as steel were up an even larger 61 
percent in march 
shipments of manufactured goods increased 26 percent to a 
record high of 2144 billion following a 08 percent february 
increase

education secretary william bennett struck 
back monday at critics who charge he is too negative about the 
nations educational system saying it has not made sufficient 
progress in the last five years 
bennett said he gave a fair amount of praise to improvements 
in a report issued last week on the fifth anniversary of a nation 
at risk the devastating analysis issued by his predecessor 
terrel bell 
we can show some progress since 1983 bennett said in a 
speech to the us chamber of commerce despite that progress i 
cannot come candidly before the american people and say that 
everythings great 
bennett said the fiveyear update american education making 
it work had provoked a firestorm of criticism although no one 
has challenged any facts in it 
in the report released last week bennett said progress has 
been too slow and we are still at risk 
he told the chamber of commerce that the educational 
establishment gave him grades of cs and ds on the report but 
i dont give a tinkers damn what they give me as long as they 
get to work improving american education 
bennett said fewer than 2 percent of american students can write 
a clear detailed coherent narrative and only 3 percent of high 
school seniors scored above 600 on their verbal sats last year 
he said middleclass kids usually can survive the decline of an 
education system but lowerclass children end up losing their only 
chance for a better life 
so if i seem a bit edgy at times about improving our education 
system theres a good reason he said 
bennett told the audience they should go to see the film stand 
and deliver for an example of how american education can be made 
to succeed without huge infusions of cash 
the movie based on the true story of jaime escalante is about 
an east los angeles calculus teacher who tames a class of inner 
city hispanic teenagers through force of personality the kids end 
up learning calculus and going to college 
bennett often at odds with teachers groups said escalante had 
never been nominated by anyone for a teacheroftheyear award 
why he asked because hes an embarrassment he proves you 
can do it

construction spending surged 15 percent in 
march the biggest increase in almost a year as government 
spending offset weakness in other areas the commerce department 
said monday 
the department said construction projects were being built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4018 billion in march 
following a 04 percent increase in february 
the march advance which was the biggest since a 2 percent rise 
in april 1987 was a bit puzzling to economists who have been 
forecasting generally sluggish activity in the building industry 
this year 
construction is doing considerably better than anyone was 
expecting it is simply remarkable said michael sumichrast an 
economist and publisher of a construction industry newsletter 
the strength last month came in large part from a 54 percent 
boom in government construction projects which analysts said 
reflected increased outlays for highway construction that congress 
approved last year over president reagans veto 
in march the increase of 7 percent pushed highway spending the 
largest category in the government sector to an annual rate of 
276 billion 169 percent higher than a year ago 
residential construction rose a modest 08 percent in march to 
an annual rate of 1914 billion as a 2 percent increase in 
singlefamily construction was largely offset by a 36 percent 
decline in multifamily construction 
nonresidential construction edged up 03 percent to an annual 
rate of 923 billion with industrial office building and hotel 
construction all recording gains 
industrial construction posted a strong 77 percent increase 
reflecting expansion projects by businesses experiencing high 
operating rates 
the february and march increases in total construction followed 
declines of 23 percent in january and 002 percent in december 
after a period of weakness construction is coming back 
largely because of the strength in the government sector said 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass 
wyss said the rise in spending confirmed reports by the labor 
department that showed jobs have increased by 200000 over the past 
two months in the construction industry 
analysts said they were still not looking for much strength in 
private construction this year because of the high vacancy rates 
for apartments and office buildings and the continued adverse 
effects of the 1986 tax overhaul legislation on these types of 
investments

vice president george bush accused michael 
dukakis monday of unfounded criticism of reagan administration 
actions in panama asserting that us efforts could be set back by 
some kind of macho statement out of harvard 
earlier in mishawaka ind bush called congressional democrats 
shortsighted for cutting president reagans military requests and 
said the nation could be hurt if an inexperienced democrat is 
elected president 
inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only our 
national security but also our economic health said bush who 
has previously criticized democratic dukakis lack of foreign 
policy experience 
bush who has already won enough delegates to sew up the 
republican presidential nomination campaigned monday in indiana 
and ohio one day before the two states have their primaries 
in vandalia fielding questions from butler high school 
students bush was asked whether it was true as dukakis has 
charged that the united states had paid panamas strongman manuel 
noriega 200000 a year 
i cant wait for mr dukakis to discuss the noriega matter 
bush replied and id say what would you do about it its 
fine sitting out there you see you can make a lot of unfounded 
criticism but whats his suggestion whats he going to do and do 
it in a way that handles the delicate central american 
relationships that were building 
were moving towards democracy ninety percent are now living 
under democracy in this hemisphere we dont want to set that back 
by some kind of macho statement out of harvard bush said 
dukakis after being turned out of office in 1978 lectured at 
harvards john f kennedy school of government 
bush said of the massachusetts governor one of the beautiful 
things about being a new candidate without a heck of a lot of 
experience in foreign affairs is you can make dramatic statements 
without necessarily having the proof 
he said he was somewhat inhibited from discussing the 
situation in panama because he was once cia director but he did 
say when it became demonstrably clear that noriega was involved 
in drugs we moved against him with an indictment 
bush said the united states does not want to hurt the panamanian 
people or take steps that appear as a great bullying 
gringoesofthenorth kind of overstatement of power were 
still living down some of the military intervention of the united 
states in central america 
in indiana he said the country wants to move ahead not go 
back to the misery we inherited through the very policies jesse 
jackson and dukakis are talking about 
bush appeared at an airport rally in south bend then visited an 
amgeneral factory in nearby mishawaka and took a short ride in a 
hummer a fastmoving successor to the military jeep he told 500 
workers he would try to keep their production line open 
amgeneral has made 48000 of the vehicles since 1983 and has 
contracts for nearly 20000 more however the army has shelved 
plans to buy more hummers for 1990 and beyond because of budget 
constraints 
bush said the united states despite progress in nuclear arms 
talks with the soviets stll faces a substantial imbalance in 
conventional forces around the world he said the soviets have 
twice as many tanks and artillery pieces as the western alliance 
as we seek to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons its 
critical that we maintain strengthen and modernize our 
conventional deterrent in europe he said the hummer is an 
integral part of that 
we took a 31 billion cut in defense because of the opposition 
in the congress a lot of it affecting what happens on this very 
production line in the future i think its shortsighted to 
fool around with the defense muscle of the united states of 
america he said

president reagan vowed anew monday to veto a 
major revision of trade laws and said a controversial provision 
requiring advance notification of plant closings was like playing 
russian roulette with a machine gun 
reagans veto promise in a speech to the us chamber of 
commerces annual meeting drew loud applause from the audience of 
about 2000 people they also cheered his statement that capital 
gains taxes should be cut sometime in the future 
the trade bill expected to reach the white house this week won 
final congressional approval in the senate last thursday on a 6336 
vote three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a veto 
one provision would require all but the smallest businesses to 
provide a 60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the bill specifies exceptions for companies in serious financial 
trouble 
the plantclosing restriction is the bills worst provision 
not the only bad one reagan said he did not cite any other 
features he considered objectionable although the administration 
has complained about the bills curbs on alaska oil exports 
he said some supporters of the notification provision say it 
will not hurt noting that many european countries have similar 
restrictions 
yep and thats among the reasons for europes poor job 
performance over the last six years reagan said 
if we had done as poorly our unemployment rate would be up 
like theirs not down from 108 percent to 55 percent reagan 
said what would organized labor say then 
anyone who would copy europe in this way is no friend to 
american workers he added for america plantclosing 
restrictions are like playing russian roulette with a machine gun 
a sure loser

scientists have found specialized nerve sites 
where a natural paincausing substance attaches itself adding 
evidence that the substance plays a key role in the bodys 
perception of pain 
molecules of the substance bradykinin bound to the nerve sites 
in experiments with dog and guinea pig nerve tissue scientists 
said in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences 
bradykinin is released from bodily tissues when they are 
injured researchers reported last year that drugs designed to 
block the binding of bradykinin to nerve sites could relieve pain 
in rats 
scientists in the new study included solomon snyder and donald 
manning of the johns hopkins medical institutions in baltimore 
larry steranka of nova pharmaceutical corp and raymond vavrek and 
john stewart of the university of colorado 
researchers incubated slices of animal spinal cord and other 
nerve tissues with bradykinin that had been labeled with a 
radioactive isotope for easy tracking tests showed the bradykinin 
bound to particular sites called receptors on sensory nerves that 
carry pain messages

britain will reconsider the use of special british 
forces license plates on its military vehicles because of fears 
they mark servicemen as ira targets a government minister promised 
monday 
the irish republican army which killed three british servicemen 
and injured three in the netherlands on sunday has threatened to 
kill more british forces members abroad 
armed forces minister ian stewart was asked in a british 
broadcasting corp radio interview whether use of the plates would 
be looked at as part of the security review promised sunday by 
defense secretary george younger 
yes it certainly will he said there are a number of 
aspects we want to look into and that is certainly one of them 
the ministry of defense said the use of a special block of 
registration numbers was an administrative convenience for a 
group of temporary residents abroad but several british lawmakers 
have criticized the plates as a giveaway to terrorists 
the daily telegraph on monday quoted an unidentified ministry of 
defense spokeman as saying that all cars owned by military 
personnel and their dependents in west germany are registered as 
british forces vehicles bearing license plates that are not the 
normal german civilian ones 
it would be a very small but effective change to put all 
number plates on the civilian register said terrorism expert dr 
richard clutterbuck of exeter university as quoted by the daily 
telegraph on monday 
sundays victims of a shooting and a bomb attack were senior 
aircraftsmen in the royal air force regiment which guards air 
bases based in west germany they were visiting dutch discotheques 
and bars just across the border 
the ira claimed responsibility for sundays attacks with a 
statement through the irish republican publicity bureau in dublin 
since launching its violent campaign to end british rule in 
northern ireland in 1969 the ira has killed 392 british soldiers 
there and 24 in mainland britain the organization has a network of 
support in the netherlands belgium and west germany 
the british armed forces have nearly 70000 personnel and 80000 
dependents stationed in west germany at four royal air force and 
five army bases 
on sunday and monday the british forces broadcasting service 
transmitted warnings to soldiers and airmen based in west germany 
terrorists only look at you for one reason be alert stay 
alive

a nursery with an artificial nesting 
beach is being built at the clearwater marine science center with 
the goal of boosting the population of the imperiled kemps ridley 
sea turtle 
the 10000 project will experiment with a firstofitskind 
beach that includes a gently sloping sand ramp and sea oats said 
dennis kellenberger the centers executive director 
the purpose to encourage female kemps ridley sea turtles to 
crawl ashore and lay their eggs only about 400 to 600 reproducing 
females of the species remain 
eight kemps ridley turtles including both sexes live at the 
marine center these 6yearold turtles are ready to reproduce and 
center officials hope they will breed and nest in captivity 
kellenberger said an attempt at using an artificial beach is a 
new approach were hoping that if theyre confined to an area 
where they really have no choice but to nest here then they 
will he said 
the tank will be partially filled with water and the turtles 
will be placed there together at one end of the tank will be a 
beach area created by putting sand on a fiberglass liner atop a 
wood platform a gently sloping sandcovered ramp will enable the 
turtles to crawl ashore and nest there when they are ready 
the kemps ridley species was decimated by poachers who waited 
for the arrival each summer of the eggladen females at their only 
natural nesting area on a gulf of mexico beach at rancho nuevo 
mexico poachers sought turtle meat widely considered a delicacy 
and eggs 
the nesting beach has been protected since 1966 but the turtles 
have not yet recovered to their former numbers partly because they 
are frequent victims of shrimpers who unwittingly drown them in 
their nets 
the creamcolored kemps ridleys are the smallest of the sea 
turtles weighing about 100 pounds they are found throughout the 
coastal waters of the united states and central america and often 
forage in the tampa bay area 
scientists dont know exactly why the kemps ridleys females lay 
their eggs on only one beach or whether enough of them can be 
persuaded to nest elsewhere

a south african court monday 
sentenced a member of the african national congress to 25 years in 
prison for murder and terrorism 
gordon webster 24 was convicted by the pietermaritzburg 
supreme court of bombing several electrical transformers one 
bombing killed a police colonel 
websters case drew widespread attention when armed colleagues 
freed him from a guarded hospital room in may 1986 webster was 
recaptured last september after he planned to take hostages in a 
bid to free one of his rescuers who by that time was awaiting 
execution 
in the highly publicized trial which ended on monday defense 
witnesses described webster as a gentle young man who joined the 
guerrilla group in a state of despair over racial discrimination in 
south africa 
sometimes i wished i could be white webster said 
sometimes i was angry for having color for what i was black 
the prosecution said webster joined the anc willingly and was 
aware that the organization waged a bombing and sabotage campaign 
the congress based in lusaka zambia is the main black group 
fighting to overthrow the government of south africa and end 
apartheid 
the judge and two assessors handling the case said they agreed 
on the 25year sentence after considering the extenuating 
circumstances in the case they said websters impoverished 
upbringing and skin color caused him difficulties as a youth they 
also said webster had not intended to kill people when he planted 
bombs 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

attorneys for reputed colombian drug 
lord carlos lehder rivas rested their case monday without calling 
any witnesses to counter 22 weeks of testimony that their client 
ran a vast cocainesmuggling empire 
defense attorney edward r shohat rested on the defenses first 
day after filing documents on deals the government made to get 
testimony from some of the 115 prosecution witnesses many of them 
admitted smugglers 
the government has literally given away the courthouse to get 
our client shohat said he declined to discuss the move with 
reporters outside the courtroom 
stephen j weinbaum an attorney for codefendant jack reed 
also rested his case without calling any witnesses 
defense attorneys often use that tactic to keep the 
sufficiency of the governments case at issue said weinbaum 
defense attorneys have questioned the credibility of witnesses 
throughout the case contending that the government reduced 
sentences gave grants of immunity and even decided not to seek 
charges against witnesses 
last week shohat had said the defense would take two weeks and 
prosecutors acknowledged they were caught offguard by the sudden 
change 
you could honestly say i looked surprised and stunned 
assistant us attorney ernst mueller said after the announcement 
was made the jury did not show any reaction 
us district judge howell melton set closing arguments for next 
week 
lehder 38 allegedly one of the leaders of the violent medellin 
cartel is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise he is accused of smuggling 33 tons 
of cocaine into the united states from his private island of 
normans cay in the bahamas from 1978 to 1980 
if convicted of all 11 counts against him lehder faces a 
maximum sentence of life plus 165 years 
reed 57 of san pedro calif is charged with conspiracy and 
faces a maximum sentence of 15 years 
melton denied a defense motion monday to sequester the jury 
during closing arguments which defense attorneys complained will 
come during just say no to drugs week 
the judge also denied a motion from shohat for a 60day 
continuance to give attorneys time to go over thousands of 
documents and visit foreign countries to prepare their defense 
the defense in this case depended in large amount on evidence 
from outside the unites states that includes principally the 
bahamas germany haiti colombia said shohat 
lehder also is also charged in separate indictments in los 
angeles and miami 
the miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of 
the socalled medellin cartel believed to be responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into united states a bonanza 
worth 8 billion each year 
according to law enforcement officials who have requested 
anonymity us attorney robert w merkle has been presenting 
evidence from the lehder trial to a federal grand jury in tampa 
investigating possible drug links to bahamian prime minister lynden

secretary of defense frank carlucci has 
decided against sending us coast guard ships to the persian gulf 
to augment the navy patrol the pentagon said today 
the department of defense is no longer considering sending 
coast guard vessels to the persian gulf at this time the 
pentagon said in a statement 
after a thorough assessment during the past week it has been 
decided that the current strength and force mix of our task force 
in the gulf is sufficient to protect us interests in the region 
and to defend against threats to the rights of usflagged ships 
as well as neutral ships in distress requesting assistance in 
international waters of the gulf the statement said 
the statement was issued after sen john warner rva the 
ranking republican on the senate armed services committee told 
reporters earlier today that he had talked to carlucci last week 
and urged that the proposal be dropped 
he carlucci said it was his current thinking that the guard 
is not going warner said the secretary of defense reached 
his decision on his own initiative but he did listen carefully to 
those of us in congress including myself and the leadership who 
suggested that this would not be the right time to take coast guard 
vessels from the united states 
a proposal to send coast guard ships to the gulf met strong 
opposition from members of congress who believe the vessels are 
needed elsewhere to stop drug runners 
the idea of sending coast guard boats had been raised by 
pentagon officials in the past week as part of a review of us 
policy in the gulf that review came in the wake of the april 18 
clash between the navy and iran when navy ships and planes sank or 
damaged six iranian ships 
administration officials announced friday that us policy in 
the wartorn waterway was changing from the previous 10monthold 
plan of having the navy protect only 11 kuwaitiowned tankers which 
have been carrying the us flag 
navy warships will now have authority to respond to calls for 
aid from any neutral merchant ships which come under attack 
assuming the american vessels is close enough to help 
pentagon officials said a week ago that consideration was being 
given to sending up to a halfdozen of the coast guards 110foot 
island class boats to the gulf the ships were designed for 
shallow waters and could help patrol the area according to 
carlucci and other officials

the house voted easily monday to again ban any 
us combat troops from nicaragua but refused to prohibit american 
servicmen from conducting maneuvers along the border of the 
leftistruled central american nation 
the decisions came as the chamber began a second week of work on 
a bill authorizing the pentagon budget for the next fiscal year 
first the democraticcontrolled house voted 27692 to block the 
sending of any combat troops into or over nicaragua 
a similar ban had been approved by the house in each of the past 
two years but it had been changed by a housesenate conference 
committee to simply make it a sense of the congress resolution 
and say the ban didnt affect a presidents constitutional power as 
commanderinchief 
rep thomas foley dwash the house majority leader sponsored 
the proposal 
he noted that president reagan has repeatedly stated the united 
states has no intention of invading nicaragua where usbacked 
contra guerrillas are now conducting peace talks with the leftist 
leaders of nicaraguas sandinista government 
it may seem to some wise to reaffirm this intention on the 
part of the administration and congress not to maintain any threat 
of intervention said foley 
but rep henry hyde rill said this perennial amendment is 
still unconstitutional in my judgement i dont think we can 
repeal the power of the president to be commanderinchief 
before passing the foley proposal the house voted 33621 
approval of an amendment by rep duncan hunter rcalif which 
said us forces could be sent into nicaragua to respond to a 
hijacking a kidnapping or other acts of terrorism against us 
citizens or citizens of a us ally 
then the house rejected 238147 an amendment by rep edward 
markey dmass that would block us personnel who are assisting 
the contras from being within 20 miles of the nicaraguan border 
the prohibition would specifically apply to us military exercises 
the pentagon has conducted a series of exercises in honduras 
which shares a border with nicaragua but us personnel have 
generally stayed away from the border 
the house also rejected 267111 an attempt to delete the 3 
million in the bill which would go for army construction plans in 
honduras 
the senate is expected next week to begin considering its 
version of a pentagon budget bill and the provisions that 
separately pass the two chambers will eventually have to be 
reconciled by a housesenate conference committee 
both the house and senate measures authorize 2995 billion in 
defense spending for the fiscal year starting oct 1 but the house 
has already added three nuclear arms control restrictions strongly 
opposed by reagan in addition to the foley proposal 
more restrictions are likely as the house continues to work 
through the bill including a deep reduction from reagans request 
for spending on his star wars antimissile research plan 
reagan sought 48 billion for the plan but the house bill 
would permit 40 billion while the senate measure allows 46 
billion the current budget is 39 billion for the strategic 
defense initiative as star wars is formally known

the body of allan ruffin lay unidentified in the 
cook county morgue for a month while his family searched 
frantically for him badgering police calling hospitals even 
asking the morgue if his body was there 
ruffins family accused the chicago police on monday of bungling 
the investigation of his disappearance launched nearly two months 
ago when the family first filed a missing persons report 
how is it that they did not discover my brother at the morgue 
when they told us they assigned an officer to us and he was 
investigating said ruffins older sister thelma 38 they 
just didnt do their jobs 
were still in a state of shock i cant believe that this has 
happened ms ruffin said monday in a telephone interview 
the ruffins complaint is under investigation and theres no 
comment on it until the investigation is cleared said officer 
ernestine dowell a chicago police department spokeswoman 
ms ruffin said the family last saw allan 35 a disabled 
vietnam war veteran on march 3 but didnt worry until three days 
later when he still hadnt shown up for his medication which he 
kept at his mothers apartment 
he had suffered a head wound in vietnam and took medication to 
prevent seizures ms ruffin said 
on march 7 another sister laverne walker went to ruffins 
room at the mark twain hotel on the citys west side to look for 
him she found his room in bloody disarray ms ruffin said 
we thought that he might have had a seizure and hit his head 
and that would have caused the blood she said so we started 
calling the hospitals and calling around the neighborhood 
the family filed a missing persons report on march 9 but ms 
ruffin contends the initial officer assigned to the case never came 
to pick up a photograph of her brother 
police pulled ruffins body from the chicago river on march 28 
it remained at the county medical examiners office until last 
wednesday when a second police investigator assigned to the case 
discovered the clothes found on the body matched the description 
provided by the family in its original missing persons report ms 
ruffin said 
everything we said that he was wearing when we last saw him 
was at the morgue she said why did he lay in the morgue since 
the 28th of march he had loved ones 
while her brother was missing ms ruffin said she and other 
family members regularly called local hospitals and distributed 
fliers with ruffins photograph 
we were hoping he had a seizure and bumped his head and maybe 
was wandering around still alive but just didnt remember who he 
was ms ruffin said 
she said they also called the morgue regularly and even went 
there on april 11 while her brothers body was there and 
inspected another unidentified body found under a viaduct to see if 
it was allan 
ms ruffin said the medical examiners office told the family 
her brother had drowned but roy dames of the medical examiners 
office said the cause of death listed on his death certificate was 
left blank pending police investigation 
ruffins will be buried tuesday

federal investigators have found evidence 
of cracks apparently caused by metal fatigue on the remaining 
fuselage of an aloha airlines jet which lost about a third of its 
roof in midflight 
however they say the investigation is continuing and it is too 
early to determine a definite cause of the accident last thursday 
in which a flight attendant died and 61 of 89 passengers were 
injured 
evidence of fatigue cracking was found at six rivet holes on a 
metal strip running the length of the boeing 737 said joseph nall 
of the national transportation safety board 
all of the planes rivets as well as those of alohas other 
737s were being tested electronically in an effort to find any 
other cracks nall said at a sunday night news conference 
however in an interview on the nbc today show monday nall 
said it was not known yet whether the cracks occurred before or 
after 20 feet of the upper fuselage was blown away at 24000 feet 
the part of the remaining fuselage where the cracks were found 
were being taken to washington for a very careful analysis to see 
just what relationship it may have had he said 
investigators are always concerned about fatigue and cracking in 
older aircraft and the aloha plane involved in the accident was an 
older one nall said 
an inspection of the aircraft showed that repairs made to two 
cracks found last november appeared to have held 
the federal aviation administration has ordered the oldest 
versions of the boeing 737 those with more than 55000 landings 
not to fly above 23000 feet 
the cargo door on the lower right side of the plane remained 
closed until the pilot made an emergency landing on maui 13 minutes 
after the incident nall said 
this added rigidity to the fuselage and helped hold the aircraft 
together until it landed he said 
seven people remained hospitalized monday all reported in 
stable condition with fractures burns and lacerations 
clarabelle cb lansing one of three flight atteedants 
aboard the plane is believed to have been blown out of the plane 
a renewed search sunday of waters south and southwest of maui 
failed to turn up any trace of her or of the missing section of 
fuselage

the vice president of the tobacco institute 
reacted sharply monday to the surgeon generals coming declaration 
that nicotine is addictive saying it is apparent that 
antitobacco zeal has overtaken common sense and good judgment 
to imply that the 55 million american tobacco smokers are drug 
abusers is to subvert and divert attention from the nations war on 
illicit drugs said walker merryman spokesman for the industry 
organization it is a trivialization of the countrys urgent 
concerns with hard drugs and verges on irresponsibility 
ronald m davis director of the federal office of smoking and 
health said sunday that a report calling tobacco an addictive drug 
will be issued by surgeon general c everett koop in the next few 
weeks davis said such a declaration means tobacco should receive 
the serious attention given to heroin and cocaine 
if ronald davis yesterday was really speaking accurately for 
and with the authorization from the surgeon general in describing 
his forthcoming report it is apparent that antitobacco zeal has 
overtaken common sense and good judgment merryman said 
it may well be that utter frustration on the part of the 
surgeon general because of lack of progress toward his goal of 
tobacco prohibition is responsible for this incredible comparison 
of tobacco use with heroin and cocaine addiction said merryman 
the office of smoking and health although not directly under 
koop in the department of health and human services organizational 
structure is among several federal agencies working at koops 
direction in developing material for the annual smoking report 
there was no question davis is familiar with the contents of the 
report but department officials expressed surprise monday that he 
discussed them in advance of the formal release tentatively 
scheduled may 16 
public health service spokesman jim brown said koop will not 
discuss the report in advance of its release 
davis made his remarks sunday on cbstvs face the nation

fistfights that erupted at the 4th 
district republican convention over the weekend could point to a 
future showdown between supporters of presidential candidate pat 
robertson and other delegates north carolinas gop chairman says 
who was right i cant say but certainly there needs to be 
more maturity and evenhandedness in handling the whole situation 
jack hawke told the news and observer of raleigh 
the confrontation involved the selection of three delegates to 
the republican national convention in august competing for the 
delegate slots were robertson supporters and gop party leaders 
backing vice president george bush 
after the confrontation robertson supporters walked out to hold 
their own convention while bush supporters elected their three 
delegates inside 
a group of robertson supporters then returned to the podium and 
screaming and fistthrowing followed as bush and robertson forces 
battled for control 
no one was seriously injured officials said 
hawke said he fears possible reprisals from conservative gop 
members if differences arent resolved at the state convention 
when you are a minority party and you are used to being 
behind you need all the help and support you can possibly 
receive he said but its a very unfortunate threat for 
anybody to oppose somebody just to get even

mayor edward i koch the target of sharp 
criticism for his attacks on presidential candidate jesse jackson 
may go to ireland rather than attend the democratic national

ireland set for july 2127 over the convention which runs july 
1821 said mayoral press secretary george arzt 
arzt quoted in sundays new york times denied the flap created 
by the attacks on jackson was behind the mayors decision to 
rethink whether or not he would be a delegate koch was 
excoriated in the news media after repeatedly criticizing jackson 
and saying jewish voters would be crazy to support the candidate in 
new yorks primary 
koch who endorsed tennessee sen albert gore jr before the new 
york primary would have to commit himself to either jackson or 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis to attend the convention as an 
atlarge delegate dukakis captured the new york primary gore 
finished a poor third and discontinued his bid for the white house

jesse jackson said monday that he and 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis are not being held to the 
same standards with the news media allowing dukakis to have 
teflon while jackson is required to back up his proposals and 
statements 
jackson spelling out proposals of his own also called for a 
substantial increase in the minimum wage and for a corporate code 
of conduct to press companies benefiting from federal help to 
invest in america and not take jobs outside the country 
in a luncheon speech to the city club a cleveland civic 
organization jackson said he would raise the minimum wage of 335 
an hour to half the average hourly wage of production workers 
which is 919 
jacksons staff said he gradually would increase the wage 
standard to 550 an hour by 1993 
he said a conduct code should establish a set of 
responsibilities to accompany the right to do business the receipt 
of government incentives tax credits and grants it encourages 
participation of workers in their companies and a greater 
productivity 
earlier after a speech to high school students in nearby parma 
jackson said dukakis has not been forced to give specifics to back 
up his campaign generalities 
so far the media is allowing him to have teflon jackson 
said a reference to a situation in which opponents criticism 
slides right off 
in time that will change jackson said the media 
challenged me to show how i would pay for my dreams i have done 
just that 
for now however jackson said dukakis has not come under the 
same kind of scrutiny concerning the priorities he would set and 
how he would pay 
so far dukakis has operated with caution when we must operate 
with courage clarity and candor jackson said 
in a wideranging economic speech on the eve of ohios 
presidential primary jackson sought to give specifics of his own 
economic proposals in what aides said was an effort to draw 
comparisons with dukakis 
jackson said his corporate code of conduct would be based on 
democratic values and a common definition of the national 
interest he said it would make corporations accountable not 
only to shareholders but to all stakeholders including the 
community and workers 
he said he wants to change corporate behavior as part of his 
plans for reversing president reagans economic policies 
jackson also renewed his call for investment of a portion of 
public pension funds into domestic development projects he said 
the program would use federal guarantees to issue bonds backed by 
development projects and would sell the bonds to the pension funds 
he said the program should include cooperation between federal 
and local governments as well as business interests 
jackson spent sunday night at the modest berea home of 
steelworker union organizer valentino fulimeni to symbolize concern 
for laborers who he said had been hurt by reagan administration 
economic policies 
there simply are two dimensions to this campaign jackson 
said besides the race for the presidency there is also a 
historical dimension it is part of the thrust to open up the 
american political system the thrust to empower lockedout 
people

a man charged with killing a baltimore 
tavern owner 13 years ago was freed monday on 10000 bail pending 
extradition proceedings 
despite deputy salt lake county attorney bud elletts 
objections 3rd circuit judge eleanor vansciver told daniel eugene 
binick he would be free pending arrival of a maryland arrest 
warrant later in may 
ellett argued that binicks surrender to the fbi last month was 
not as voluntary as it appeared 
defense attorney kendall hatch countered that binicks surrender 
stemmed from his desire to clear up the maryland charge he 
emphasized that binick 40 maintains his innocence 
a friend of binicks nancy lombard said she was posting the 
10000 
i have absolute faith in this man i have no worry about him 
going anywhere said lombard an acquaintance of nine years he 
and his wife have helped an enormous number of people i simply 
believe this is the time when someone should help him 
binick turned himself in to the fbi march 14 12 years after he 
assumed the name of jerry lebaue 
ive looked over my shoulder for 13 years on this charge and i 
was tired he told vansciver at a hearing last week 
binick said his attorney had talked to the fbi 72 hours before 
he surrendered and if he had wanted to run he had plenty of chances 
to do so at that time 
a maryland grand jury indicted binick for murder in the march 5 
1975 slaying of walter seborowski shot during a robbery of his 
tavern the crime was widely publicized because seborowski was a 
world war ii hero who had escaped a prisonerofwar camp 
binick is married with two stepchildren he has been active in 
alcoholics anonymous and other community work for a decade and 
friends have petitioned gov norm bangerter to intervene in his

on the lavish grounds of the fouracre merv griffin estate mrs 
reagan told the 42 guests gathered at a power breakfast that 
her proposed nancy reagan center for drug abuse is the next stage 
in her drug fight 
several locations in los angeles county are being considered for 
the 10 million facility and no decision has been made on a site 
said dan langdon the the new yorkbased phoenix house 
she was received very well said griffin publicist warren 
cowan she is going to be very active and work at this when she 
leaves she talked about setting up this facility and she recounted 
her history with the drug program 
the phoenix house the nations largest private nonprofit drug 
abuse service agency will operate the center described by mrs 
reagan as a central institution in the battle against youthful 
drug abuse 
breakfast guests began arriving just before 8 am with a

george bush charged monday that michael dukakis advocates 
policies that would return america to the misery inherited by 
the reagan administration in 1981 while jesse jackson accused the 
democratic frontrunner of caution where we must operate with 
courage clarity and candor 
dukakis anticipating landslide presidential primary victories 
tuesday in ohio and indiana turned jacksons comments aside by 
saying im not just a talker im a doer 
the massachusetts governor returning republican fire also took 
aim at embattled attorney general edwin meese iii we want an 
attorney general that you and i can be proud of not ashamed of 
he said 
dukakis added that the reagan administration has failed to 
provide sufficient funding for day care programs for children 
jackson addressed economics as well during the day calling for 
a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage from the current 
335 an hour to 550 an hour by 1993 the last increase occurred 
jan 1 1981 
ohio indiana and the district of columbia offer a total of 254 
democratic national convention delegates in tuesdays primaries 
dukakis is heavily favored to defeat jackson in ohio and indiana 
and may capture 200 or more delegates in the three races combined 
thus padding his substantial lead over his sole remaining opponent 
the massachusetts governor has nearly 1300 of the 2081 
delegates needed to claim the nomination according to the 
associated press count the slow steady trickle of party leaders 
to dukakis side continued during the day as sen john d 
rockefeller iv of west virginia announced his support 
jackson is favored to win the district of columbia primary 
bush already has enough delegates to assure his nomination at 
the gop convention in august and has no active republican 
opposition in tuesdays primaries 
the days campaign comments fit a pattern that has emerged in 
recent days with the vice president criticizing dukakis for being 
inexperienced and advocating policies that are too liberal and 
jackson seeking to prod his democratic rival into moving to the 
left 
in a day of campaigning in indiana bush said the issues in the 
fall would be peace and jobs and added the country wants to 
move ahead not go back to the misery we inherited through the very 
policies jackson and dukakis are talking about 
inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only our 
national security but also our economic strength bush added 
the vice president visited a factory where hummer defense 
vehicles are made and promised to try and keep the production line 
open 
we took a 31 billion cut in defense because of the opposition 
in the congress a lot of it affecting what happens on this very 
production line in the future he said 
the vice president later accused dukakis of unfounded criticism 
of the administrations handling of the regime in panama and said 
us efforts in central america could be set back by some kind of 
macho statement out of harvard 
i cant wait for mr dukakis to discuss the noriega matter 
bush said referring to allegations that the cia made payments to 
panamanian strongman manuel noriega now under indictment for drug 
running 
one of the beautiful things about being a new candidate is you 
can make dramatic statements without necessarily having the 
proof bush said he was somewhat inhibited from discussing 
the situation because of his past tenure as cia director but said 
when it became demonstrably clear that noriega was involved in 
drugs we moved against him 
jackson campaigned through ohio jabbing at dukakis while 
calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage as well as a 
corporate code of conduct to prevent american jobs from being 
exported overseas 
in a luncheon speech to the city club in cleveland he said the 
minimum wage should be raised to an amount equal to half the 
average wage in america 
the most recent bureau of labor statistics report pegged the 
average nonagricultural wage as of march at 919 an hour half of 
that would be nearly 460 an hour an increase of 125 over the 
current minimum wage of 335 aides said jacksons proposal called 
for a gradual hike to 550 an hour over the next five years 
as for dukakis jackson said the news media had created a 
teflon candidate by allowing the governor to escape providing 
details of his campaign commitments so far dukakis has operated 
with caution when we must operate with courage clarity and 
candor he said 
dukakis spent part of his day visiting a day care center at a 
predominantly black cincinnati high school as part of an attempt to 
court more black support he also told reporters he had no 
intention of criticizing jackson whose supporters will be 
essential to any democrats chance of success in the fall

while criticizing what it deemed bureaucratic 
bungling the 5th us circuit court of appeals said monday it was 
powerless to help a texas woman who lost 1100 because of bad 
advice from social security administration employees 
this case is an example of how the governments brain often 
fails to control the movement of its fingers the court said in 
an opinion written by judge e grady jolly 
in may 1983 marie b jones of dallas called the social security 
administration to see whether she could receive early retirement 
benefits and later use her former husbands work records as a basis 
for higher benefits the court said mrs jones who was 62 at the 
time she called for advice was told that if she accepted benefits 
based on her own work record she would be barred from receiving 
the larger divorcedspouse benefits when she reached 65 
this information was incorrect the court said monday 
mrs jones sister clarice soven made a similar telephone call 
and got the same erroneous advice the court said 
in october 1984 after she filed for benefits based on her 
husbands work record mrs jones was told that she could have 
received 1100 of early retirement benefits had she filed in 1983 
the sisters began attempting to collect the 1100 lost by mrs 
jones appealing through the social security system the courts 
and writing to their senator and to the secretary of health and 
human services 
but their efforts went virtually for naught as mrs jones lost 
in a district court in texas she appealed but was told monday the 
5th circuits threejudge panel couldnt help her 
although it is clear that under relevant case law mrs jones 
claim must be dismissed we are very sympathetic with her plight 
jolly wrote she has been misled and unjustifiably denied her 
rightful benefits at a time when she seriously needed funds 
such is life in the post1984 orwellian bureaucracy

thousands of undocumented aliens armed with lawn 
chairs ice chests and toys queued outside the nations busiest 
immigration office monday to apply for amnesty just two days before 
the unprecedented programs deadline 
immigration and naturalization service officials hired police 
officers to controls crowds and traffic and brought in portable 
toilets to ease the wait 
this is an incredible amount of activity regional ins 
commissioner mario ortiz said the pace is really phenomenal 
particularly in dallas and houston 
by midmorning monday a line containing several hundred people 
circled the shopping center that houses the houston office and 
stretched into an alley 
many of the 2000 applicants processed by noon had camped out 
since sunday evening to be at the head of the line said richard s 
rios director of the center 
i really didnt know what to do zeerak khan 20 of 
pakistan said as she waited in the line thats why i waited 
until the last minute 
one woman stood holding her baby in one arm and clutched amnesty 
documents in the other that were longer than the infant others 
camped out with lawn chairs and ice chests and brought toys for 
their children 
officials planned to deal with the lastminute rush by keeping 
offices in the 13state southern region open from tuesday morning 
straight through to the midnight wednesday deadline ortiz said 
they also were waiving interviews with applicants until after the 
deadline 
the 1986 immigration reform and control act allows aliens who 
can prove continuous residency in the united states since jan 1 
1982 to apply for legal status by midnight wednesday the filing 
fee is 185 for adults and 50 for children with a family limit of 
420 
people turning in applications monday received a receipt 
temporary work authorization number and an interview date in many 
cases not until november 
the ins latest figures show that as of saturday more than 13 
million aliens had applied for amnesty at 107 ins offices 
nationwide ortiz said the total is near the agencys planning 
estimate he added 
in houston marcelino crespo vargas said he finally got the 
documentation to prove hes been living and working in nearby 
dayton for 16 years 
ive been living here so long ive got nothing to go back to 
in mexico said the 34yearold gardener from salamanca mexico 
sam urueme 28 a chef from nigeria said he wants to become an 
american citizen mainly to come and go as i please to take 
advantage of making a good living and starting a business 
hopefully a restaurant 
urueme said he and his friend christy lawrence 33 of lagos 
arrived at 630 am to find line circling the building 
of the 93000 applicants received in houston so far 73 percent 
are from mexico and 92 percent are of latin american descent rios 
said about 50000 applicants were predicted to be processed when 
the houston center opened last year but now rios says his office 
will exceed 100000 
the houston offices crush was mirrored at other texas 
locations such as in harlingen where francisco gallegos 45 said 
he and his wife arrived late sunday afternoon and spent the night 
it was so we wouldnt have to be waiting back there he 
said pointing to a ong line that stretched into the parking lot of

a christian science couple pleaded innocent monday 
to charges that they caused their sons death by failing to seek 
medical treatment because of their religious beliefs 
david and ginger twitchell formerly of bostons hyde park 
section appeared in suffolk superior court on manslaughter charges 
stemming from the april 8 1986 death of their 2yearold son 
robyn 
twitchell dressed in a dark blue leisure suit and his wife 
who wore a lavender pantsuit with lavendercolored plastic flowers 
in her hair stood close to each other and held hands as they both 
entered not guilty pleas before trial magistrate gary wilson 
a pretrial conference was set for june 1 the twitchells who 
have two other sons jeremy 6 and brian 7 months were released 
on their own recognizance 
in response to a motion filed by the prosecution superior court 
judge sandra hamlin imposed a gag order on all parties in the case 
pending a hearing thursday on the matter 
assistant district attorney thomas j mundy requested the order 
for attorneys in the case complaining about the published remarks 
made last week by one of the two defense attorneys rikki klieman 
mundy said kliemans statements violated the canon of ethics and 
could poison the pool of prospective jurors 
kliemans remarks published in the boston globe included the 
statement that the death of the twitchell child was not a crime 
klieman argued in court monday that she was not suggesting that 
the twitchells were either innocent or guilty but was merely 
referring to the fact that the childs death did not constitute a 
crime under state law 
its our reading of the law that there has been no crime 
here she said 
the twitchells are the second set of christian science parents 
to be prosecuted in the state and the first since 1971 when the 
state amended the child abuse and neglect law to recognize 
spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine 
followers of christian science refuse medicine or other health 
care on the belief that true understanding of god acts as a cure 
according to police reports robyn twitchell became feverish and 
lethargic in early april 1986 the twitchells contacted a church 
practitioner who came to their home to pray for the boys recovery 
on the evening of his death the boy developed convulsions and 
lost consciousness and vital signs the boys father first called a 
funeral director who told him to contact the police the boy was 
pronounced dead at carney hospital in boston 
klieman said the official cause of death was complications from 
a bowel obstruction she said it stemmed from a congenital birth 
defect 
officials will not reveal the twitchells current town of 
residence klieman said david twitchell works in a retirement home 
and mrs twitchell is a homemaker 
in 1967 dorothy sheriden of harwich was convicted of 
manslaughter for the death of her 5yearold daughter from a lung 
infection 
the church of christ scientist is located in boston and the 
denomination has about 3200 branches worldwide

defense secretary frank c carlucci has 
decided against having us coast guard ships help the navy patrol 
the persian gulf at this time the pentagon said monday 
the announcement came amid strong congressional opposition to 
the idea on grounds the coast guard is needed at home to fight drug 
smuggling and confirmed a disclosure hours earlier by sen john 
warner rva 
warner ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee and a former navy secretary said he spoke with carlucci 
last week and urged that the proposal be dropped 
he carlucci said it was his current thinking that the guard 
is not going warner said in a telephone interview from norfolk 
va 
the secretary of defense reached his decision on his own 
initiative but he did listen carefully to those of us in congress 
including myself and the leadership who suggested that this would 
not be the right time to take coast guard vessels from the united 
states 
he said carlucci is now of a mind to pull back from that 
proposal because these vessels are needed to interdict the drug 
trade i dont believe the idea is going ahead 
late monday the pentagon issued a statement agreeing the idea 
of deploying coast guard vessels was no longer under consideration 
at this time 
the statement said after a thorough assessment during the 
past week it has been decided that the current strength and force 
mix of our task force in the gulf is sufficient to protect us 
interests in the region and to defend against threats to the rights 
of usflagged ships as well as neutral ships in distress 
requesting assistance in international waters of the gulf 
the idea of sending coast guard boats had been raised by 
pentagon officials in the past two weeks as part of a review of 
us policy in the gulf that review came in the wake of the april 
18 clash between the navy and iran when navy ships and planes sank 
or damaged six iranian ships 
administration officials announced friday that us policy in 
the wartorn waterway was changing from the previous 10monthold 
plan of only having the navy protect 11 kuwaitiowned tankers which 
have been carrying the us flag 
navy warships will now have authority to respond to calls for 
aid from any neutral merchant ships which come under attack 
assuming the american vessels is close enough to help 
officially the united states is neutral in the iraniraq war 
but kuwait has aided iraq and critics of the us policy say the 
reagan administration is tilting too far toward iraq 
warner praised the policy change i believe this new policy 
may discourage iranian attacks on neutral shipping because it will 
inject an element of uncertainty as to their attacks on neutral 
shipping he explained 
iran only has two frigates left along with a number of 
smaller vessels warner said they may be discouraged from using 
their vessels in situations where they may lose those craft 
pentagon officials said last month that consideration was being 
given to sending up to a halfdozen of the coast guards 110foot 
island class boats to the gulf the ships were designed for 
shallow waters and could help patrol the area according to 
carlucci and other officials 
but the proposal ran into heavy criticism on capitol hill and 
carluccis reversal prompted reps mike lowry dwash and claude 
pepper dfla to scrap plans to push legislation barring use of 
the coast guard ships 
we would have won we had the votes but theres no need to go 
through with it now lowry said rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee said it was a nonstarter 
from the beginning and im glad carlucci could understand that 
that idea was going nowhere 
warner said he told carlucci the coast guard is stretched thin 
in this difficult mission of protecting against drugs and i dont 
think anything should be done to hinder that mission interdiction 
of drugs is a critical issue and the coast guard needs all its 
resources 
the navy now has 27 ships in the persian gulf and the nearby 
arabian sea and there may be a few more smaller ships sent to the 
area because the coast guard isnt going said warner 
while warner supported the new protection policy sen brock 
adams dwash was critical 
i think this a further escalation in the gulf without 
congressional authority he said i dont think we should do 
it this is a continuing ad hoc stepbystep change in foreign 
policy thats being done without congressional approval 
adams wants the senate to invoke the war powers act the 1973 
law that limits a presidents right to send us military personnel 
to situations of imminent danger reagan has refused to invoke 
the law arguing that it is unconstitutional 
i think were getting in deeper in the gulf and the congress 
should assume its oversight role something which we havent 
done adams said weve sidestepped the issue 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said pentagon officials had 
explained the new us policy to him including the rules of 
engagement under which american weapons will be fired 
i just think they ought to be clarified the rules of 
engagement and there ought to be a clear understanding among our 
own people there as to what is expected said wright

the head of a guerrilla group seeking to end 
south africas rule in namibia said monday he intends to create a 
democratic state with a nonaligned foreign policy 
sam nujoma of the southwest africa peoples organization or 
swapo also said that if he attains power in namibia he would 
destroy colonial institutions and replace them with programs to 
provide health services and education to the african majority 
the national policy would be geared to developing namibias 
economy nujoma said at a capitol hill conference sponsored by 
the world council of churches 
nujomas vision of the kind of government swapo would run came 
in response to questions about his supposed links to communist 
groups 
nujoma who has been fighting the war for namibias independence 
for 22 years acknowledged that his organization accepts assistance 
from any group if the assistance is genuine swapo has observer 
status at the united nations 
nujoma has his headquarters in luanda the capital of angola 
which is backed by the soviet and cuban governments an estimated 
70000 namibian refugees live in angola and neighboring zambia 
nujoma described swapo as a national liberation movement 
with many christian members as well as a sprinkling of whites 
if he is ever elected he said he would create a democratic 
state recognizing the freedoms of speech and assembly turning 
to those namibians who have collaborated with the white south 
african regime nujoma said we will find a way of accommodating 
them 
south africa has ruled namibia since after world war 1 in 1978 
the united nations security council adopted a resolution which 
calls for the immediate withdrawal of south african troops from 
namibia and the holding of unsponsored elections the south 
africans have refused to leave 
reagan administration officials have tried to broker a deal 
whereby the cuban troops leave angola in exchange for south 
africas withdrawal from namibia but that effort has not been 
successful

dutch police were reported stymied 
on monday in efforts to track down ira attackers who killed three 
british airmen and a british antiterrorist unit arrived to help 
in the search 
the irish republican army raiders struck in closely coordinated 
attacks on sunday in the midst of a festive dutch holiday 
we have no indication as to the description of the 
attackers nor indications of their escape route or their means of 
escape police spokesman harry clabbers told reporters at a 
briefing in this southeastern dutch city 
scotland yard announced monday night that an antiterrorist 
squad officer and an officer from the special branch which deals 
with national security matters had come to the netherlands at the 
request of dutch authorities 
earlier monday another dutch police spokesman noted it was easy 
to escape through porous dutch borders with little time needed to 
get away to west germany or belgium 
three british air force men stationed in west germany were 
killed and three others injured in an early sunday ambush at 
roermond and a car bomb attack in nieuwbergen 30 miles to the 
north 
the british defense ministry said the victims were unarmed and 
off duty and were in the netherlands over the weekend for 
celebrations of the official 50th birthday of dutch queen beatrix 
on sunday the ira claimed responsibility for both attacks in a 
coded message to belfast news media 
in the hague police presence around the british embassy was 
reinforced but dutch law enforcement officials refused to discuss 
increased security measures 
the feeling expressed in official british circles in the 
netherlands was that the ira mounted the attacks in reprisal for 
the march 6 killing by british soldiers of three ira activists in 
gibraltar 
clabbers told reporters dozens of residents and bystanders were 
questioned in nieuwbergen and roermond but the information 
yielded by those interviews is very meager 
he said forensic experts closely studied the attack sites on 
monday 
road signs and military radio stations meanwhile discouraged 
british forces in west germany from travel in or through the 
netherlands 
about 70000 british military are stationed in west germany 
along with 80000 dependents

by helicopter gunships punched into southeastern lebanon in pursuit 
of palestinian guerrillas

strip north of its border with lebanon 
police in beirut said initial reports from the area in the 
western sector of lebanons syriancontrolled bekaa valley

guerrilla raids into northern israel from southeast lebanon in 
recent weeks

the army had opened a new detention center in jerusalem for 
palestinians under age 16 
israeli military law in the occupied west bank and gaza strip

beit wazan died sunday night in al ittihad hospital the army said 
hospital officials quoted family members as saying he was 
electrocuted while following orders from soldiers to remove a 
palestinian flag from the pole but the army said abdulhak 
apparently was trying to hang the red green black and white 
banner israel has outlawed the palestinian flag

palestinians killed since the rebellion began dec 8 in the west 
bank and gaza which israel has occupied since the 1967 middle east

combined circulation of about 10000 in english and arabic was the 
first palestinian publication to interview israelis in an effort to 
promote dialogue 
now the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier

the un secretarygenerals mission to 
north africa failed at the outset monday and he will end the trip 
after visiting only one of three parties to a dispute over the 
western sahara a un source reported 
javier perez de cuellar said he would return to new york from 
morocco without visiting mauritania or algeria 
algeria supports the polisario independence movement which has 
fought morocco for control of the the western sahara since spain 
withdrew from the phosphaterich territory in november 1975 
the secretarygeneral said he had to cut short the trip because 
of quite a lot of problems in new york but the un source 
said the mission foundered because of difficulties with the 
polisario he would not provide details and spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
perez de cuellar had been scheduled to visit a major polisario 
base at tindouf algeria and meet with chadli bendjedid algerias 
president he was also was scheduled to meet with officials in 
mauritania 
he arrived in rabat morocco on monday for a meeting with king 
hassan ii 
there he said he had changed his schedule and planned to see 
the leaders of algeria and mauritania and the secretarygeneral of 
the polisario later this month during the organization of african 
unity summit in addis ababa ethiopia 
his remarks in rabat were made available to reporters at the 
united nations late monday 
neither morocco nor algeria had indicated willingness to make 
concessions in the 13year dispute over the western sahara 
after spain left the territory it was divided between morocco 
and mauritania which ceded its interest to morocco in 1979 
official media in morocco and algeria had reiterated the 
irreconcilable positions of their governments on the eve of perez 
de cuellars mission 
algiers radio repeated demands for moroccan withdrawal from the 
territory and direct negotiations between morocco and the polisario 
as a preliminary to any referendum 
moroccan media restated moroccos refusal either to withdraw or 
negotiate with the polisario which it calls algerian 
mercenaries 
since november 1975 morocco has spent an estimated 15 million 
a day defending the territory against polisario attacks from 
sanctuaries on the algerian side of the unmarked border 
thousands of combatants have died on both sides of the 
undeclared war the 80000 nomads who lived in the territory in 
1975 have fled to algeria or safe parts of the desert region 
king hassan has offered to conduct a unsupervised referendum 
among the inhabitants on condition that his 120000man army is 
not required to withdraw before the vote

a supporter of political extremist lyndon 
larouche took over as chairman of the nations secondlargest local 
chapter of the democratic party monday but wary party officials 
have made sure his power is limited 
harris county democratic chairman claude jones and the local 
party agree on one thing their top priority is electing a 
democratic president this fall it remains to be seen if they can 
find common ground elsewhere 
my main goal over the next six months is to ensure harris 
county does not go to george bush jones said the democratic 
party needs to pull together a very clear platform as an 
alternative to the reagan and bush austerity 
but jack carter who under new rules will run the partys 
political operations as its secretary emphasized that the party 
wont deviate from democratic orthodoxy 
the 1988 democratic platform will set the message we will be 
electing candidates upon carter said we will not not change 
our platform to jones goals hes going to have to move to us 
jones stunned the party leadership by defeating chairman larry 
veselka by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent in the march 8 
election pundits said his victory stemmed in part from a game of 
names jones was a more palatable choice for many voters than 
veselka 
jones works full time for larouche a perennial 
ultraconservative presidential candidate who has claimed that 
britains queen elizabeth ii is involved in drug trafficking and 
has urged a quarantine of all aids patients 
three days after the election the partys 34member steering 
committee changed the party bylaws to dilute the incoming 
chairmans powers 
the 664member executive committee comprised of precinct 
chairmen unanimously approved the changes april 15 a state judge 
denied a request by jones for a temporary restraining order to 
thwart that vote 
harris county which includes houston is the nations 
secondbiggest election district after illinois cook county which 
includes chicago harris county will send more delegates to the 
democratic national convention this summer than 17 entire states 
party officials say jones main duties will be accepting 
applications and certifying candidates for the partys primaries 
texas held its democratic primary for the presidency and state and 
local offices on march 8 super tuesday the party does not have 
another primary scheduled this year 
jones said he will work to broaden the partys voter base 
ive already initiated a voterregistration drive we had 
several set up around the city over the weekend jones said 
i personally signed up 40 new voters and we have a goal of 
100000 new voters by the fall election 
jones is to be formally sworn in tuesday night

the virus that causes aids can invade the bone 
marrow and infect cells there even when the virus cannot be 
detected in blood samples a national institutes of health 
scientist said monday 
anthony s fauci director of the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases a part of the nih said he and other 
researchers found that the bone marrow which is the bodys 
bloodmaking organ can become a quiet haven for the deadly aids 
virus 
our study shows that it the bone marrow can be a 
reservoir he said it the aids virus can reside in the 
marrow but not be detected in the peripheral blood 
the finding adds to the types of cells in the body known to be 
attacked by the virus that causes aids or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
in addition the finding demonstrates just how challenging it 
will be to develop an antiviral drug or vaccine to defeat the aids 
virus said fauci in order to effect a cure some way will have to 
be found to seek out and destroy the virus wherever it hides 
it is going to be very difficult to eliminate each and every 
viral particle in the body said fauci because the virus takes 
refuge in cell groups and apparently can live there in a latent 
state for years without causing any clinical signs of infection 
the virus called the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv was 
first thought to infect only tlymphocyte cells that have a protein 
on the cell surface called cd4 researchers later learned that the 
virus also could invade some brain cells and another type of blood 
cell the monocyte 
now said fauci researchers have confirmed that the virus also 
can reside in the cells of the bone marrow this is important 
because the bone marrow is the factory that makes the various types 
of blood cells 
in routine blood examinations the test for aids involves a 
search for antibodies to the virus since the virus itself often is 
not found in the blood 
fauci said it is yet to be absolutely confirmed but there is a 
suggestion that the hiv lives in a type of bone marrow cell that is 
the immature form of the monocyte and unlike the tlymphocyte the 
virus does not kill the bone marrow cell but reproduces within the 
cell 
researchers are still trying to understand what causes the 
latent virus to suddenly start reproducing and become an active 
infection after living in the body quietly for years fauci said 
there is some suggestion that the triggering mechanism may be the 
response of the immune system to other infections this may start a 
process that in effect turns on the virus 
fauci reported on the research during a lecture at a joint 
meeting of three organizations of physicians and clinical 
researchers 
aids is a contagious fatal disease that kills by attacking the 
tcell lymphocytes a key part in the bodys immune system when 
the tcells are killed the body is unable to protect itself 
against disease and death usually results from opportunistic 
infections 
the aids virus most often is spread through close contact with 
blood blood products or semen from infected persons 
as of april 21 aids had been diagnosed in about 59500 
americans of whom more than half or about 33000 have died since 
june 1981 according to the federal centers for disease control no 
one is known to have recovered from aids

a long battle for custody of a 9yearold girl 
whose mother went to jail rather than disclose her whereabouts went 
before a probate judge monday in a private proceeding that court 
officials said could take weeks 
the highly publicized fight over nicole lalonde began three 
years ago when 41yearold virginia lalonde accused her exhusband 
stephen lalonde 37 of sexually abusing the child while he had 
custody of her 
a probate judge determined the charges were unfounded then in 
june 1986 mrs lalonde went into hiding with nicole rather than 
obey a court order allowing unsupervised visits with the father 
mother and daughter eventually settled in florida but in march 
1987 mrs lalonde decided to return to massachusetts to settle the 
matter when she did she was thrown in jail and thrust into the 
public spotlight 
mrs lalonde returned alone and refused to disclose her 
daughters whereabouts her silence drew a contemptofcourt 
citation and an openended term in jail where she remained until 
october 
mrs lalonde was released after nicole was discovered in durham 
nc a babysitter there tipped police that the child was being 
sheltered by an underground railroad of women who claim the courts 
ignore claims that their husbands abused their children 
the lalonde fight persisted and made headlines until it headed 
for the showdown in court 
suffolk county probate judge mary c fitzpatrick has barred the 
public from the proceedings which are expected to last six weeks 
in addition participants in the case and their lawyers are 
forbidden to speak to reporters 
an array of lawyers and medical experts are expected to testify 
but central to the case will be a medical and psychological 
evaluation performed on nicole last fall 
as soon as the girl was brought back from north carolina the 
state department of social services took her into custody and 
admitted her to cambridge hospital where she stayed more than a 
month as investigators tried to find out whether her mothers 
charges were true 
although the resulting report was sealed by the court excerpts 
were leaked to the media alleging that doctors had found signs the 
girl had been sexually abused it also was disclosed that the 
evaluators had recommended that stephen lalonde seek counseling 
lalonde had remained mute for six months while proclaiming his 
innocence through his lawyer when he briefly broke his silence he 
said said he was receiving psychotherapy he has remarried 
meantime nicole has lived with a foster family since leaving 
the hospital

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
responding to jesse jacksons assertion that he is a manager but 
not a leader said monday he was not just a talker and had a 
proven leadership record 
he also fired anew at the apparent republican nominee george 
bush saying he would continue to press the vice president to fully 
explain his role in the irancontra affair and the reagan 
administrations dealings with panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
this administration has broken the law dukakis said in 
an interview with the associated press i think the vice 
president has to address the issue 
as dukakis took the offensive against bush he was fending off 
barbs by jackson 
on sunday jackson repeated his contention that dukakis would 
manage reaganomics and said of his democratic rival dont be 
bragging about how clean the kitchen is and cool if the kitchen 
is clean and cool aint nothing cooking 
asked to respond monday dukakis referred to his states 29 
percent unemployment rate its antidrug programs and the recent 
passage of legislation guaranteeing all workers health care 
thats a lot of fire and a lot of productivity said 
dukakis the likely democratic nominee im not just a talker 
im a doer theres no question about my record 
the massachusetts governor winding down his campaign for 
tuesdays presidential primary in ohio also courted black voters 
and chided the reagan admimistration for what he said was a failure 
to provide adequate support for day care programs 
surrounded by a dozen black children at a nursery in a 
cincinnati high school dukakis called on president reagan to 
endorse a housepassed bill that would increase day care funding 
this is the kind of thing we need dukakis said of the 
inschool day care program we need it as a matter of national 
policy 
after singing a song with the children and reading them a story 
dukakis walked across the street and visited a greek restaurant he 
urged supporters to ignore polls showing him well ahead of jackson 
in ohio but he appeared relaxed and confident taking time at the 
cincinnati airport to toss a football with aides 
dukakis headed from cincinnati to columbus where he spoke to a 
lunchtime crowd of several thousand people at an outdoor rally and 
was to stop in cleveland and parma before heading back to boston 
he said he was not criticizing jackson 
im just saying that i think the american people are looking 
for somebody who not only has a very strong commitment to schools 
and economic opportunity and decent housing and health care but 
also someone who has done these things dukakis said 
dukakis said the appearance at the predominantly black hughes 
high school was not designed to lure voters away from jackson but 
campaign aides said the stop was part of an effort to broaden 
dukakis support among blacks heading into the general election 
greeting dukakis at school was loretta carter of cincinnati who 
worked for one of dukakis gubernatorial campaigns when she was 
living in boston in the 1970s 
ms carter who is black predicted dukakis would win 
overwhelming support among blacks if he promised jackson a key 
campaign or administration post 
i think he has to have an important role ms carter said of 
jackson but i dont think as vice president i think if he was 
on the ticket we would lose 
dukakis stuck to what has been the thrust of his campaign in 
recent weeks carefully avoiding sharp criticism of jackson while 
denouncing the reagan administration 
he said the federal trade and budget deficits had put the 
nations economy at risk 
if youre serious about good jobs about economic development 
then youve got to balance your books dukakis said 
he continued to denounce reagans plans to veto the trade bill 
passed by congress and also renewed his criticism of attorney 
general edwin meese iii

the south african position monday that cuban troops must withdraw 
from angola before there can be peace in southern africa

breakthrough on the angolan civil war at a meeting set for tuesday 
and wednesday in britain it involves angola cuba the united 
states and south africa 
cuba has more than 40000 troops in angola supporting the 
marxist government south africa and the united states back the 
prowestern rebels of unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola 
i want to warn against being too overoptimistic because there 
are major mischief makers all over the world who want to 
destroy every positive effort to bring about better conditions in 
southern africa botha said the moment the cubans leave that 
part of southern africa and it is safe then south africas forces 
will leave too 
angola claims south africa has 9000 soldiers with heavy 
artillery in southern angola south africa acknowledges having 
forces there but says the number has not exceeded 3000 at any time 
in the past year 
south africa is fighting a bush war in southwest africa which 
it controls against the wishes of the united nations with the 
southwest africa peoples organization the guerrilla group known

withdrawal of cuban troops angola and the soviet union its other 
main ally insist that south africa withdraw from namibia as 
demanded in a 1966 un resolution so the territory can become 
independent 
previous efforts at a settlement have stalled in part because 
of us support for south africas demand that cuban troops leave 
angola before the south africans leave namibia 
botha said monday that south africa would like to see namibia 
progress toward independence but we cannot afford to allow 
foreign troops in the region dictate how it is achieved

lech walesa proclaimed a strike monday at 
the huge lenin shipyard in gdansk where solidarity was born in 
1980 in a major escalation of the weeklong labor turmoil in 
communist poland 
it was the fourth strike in poland in a week the worst wave of 
labor unrest since the governments december 1981 military 
crackdown on solidarity 
the news heartened steelworkers in southern poland who no 
longer were the countrys only workers still on strike 
we feel better now said jan ciesielski a member of the 
steel strike committee 
authorities were reported mounting a nationwide roundup of 
regional leaders of solidarity 
a solidarity communique signed by walesa and issued late monday 
said a strike wave is covering the country they are not just 
local conflicts they are across poland because the cause is the 
economic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies that 
would offer prospects for the future 
workers want pay raises of 5060 percent to balance prices 
which have risen 42 percent this year because of reductions in 
subsidies by the communist government 
walesa winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize still works as an 
electrician at the baltic coast lenin yard employing 12000 
workers he did not launch the strike but addressed strikers later 
and announced his support according to various activists 
walesa led the 1980 work stoppage at gdansk which shook the 
communist government to its roots and gave rise to solidarity the 
first independent trade union federation in the soviet bloc 
solidarity was suppressed and outlawed under martial law 
monday evening solidaritys chaplain the rev henryk 
jankowski presided in the shipyard at a prayer service attended by 
walesa a newly formed strike committee and hundreds of workers 
about 3000 workers were occupying the yard late monday enough 
to shut down operations said solidarity adviser jacek kuron the 
shipyard has a payroll of 12000 workers 
the government press office in warsaw at first confirmed the 
strike but on monday evening government spokesman jerzy urban 
called the associated press and said there was only a rally by 
several hundred people at the shipyard 
it would be rather difficult for me to say the entire shipyard 
is working in that atmosphere but generally speaking the shipyard 
is working he said kuron said police arrested nine regional 
representatives on the 13member solidarity national executive 
commission two commission members including walesa were free and 
whereabouts of two more were a mystery he said 
union activists said the gdansk strike began with a march around 
the shipyard by dozens of workers after a breakfast break the 
march grew to 200 people and ended at the main gate 
there while shifts were changing at 2 pm the solidarity 
activists encouraged workers to strike union supporters said 
the strike action undoubtedly is in response to lech 
walesas call on sunday for protest actions in support of the 
striking nowa huta steelworkers said joanna wojciechowicz a 
solidarity activist in gdansk 
the workers formed a strike committee led by alojzy szablewski 
said a spokesman at st brygidas church a solidarity stronghold 
near the shipyard 
management agreed to talk to the strike committee tuesday kuron 
said 
walesa chairman of the outlawed but still active labor 
federation said through spokesmen he stayed off the strike 
committee to coordinate solidarity activities nationwide 
the strike by thousands of steelworkers at the lenin steel works 
in nowa huta outside krakow entered its eighth day tuesday 
polands latest labor trouble began april 25 with a wildcat 
action by transit workers in bydgoszcz it was settled the same day 
with pay raises of at least 50 percent 
thousands of workers at the stalowa wola heavy machinery plant 
in southeast poland struck on friday and ended the action saturday 
after promises of higher pay 
about half the 3500 workers at the dolmel electronics plant in 
wroclaw southwestern poland stopped work from about 10 am 
monday to the end of the shift at 2 pm government and opposition 
spokesmen reported jozef pinior a solidarity leader said it 
ended when management promised a raise 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman urged 
the polish government to negotiate with workers and declared the 
use of force cannot contribute to national reconciliation 
police surrounded the gdansk shipyard and checked the papers of 
people approaching the gates a witness said 
banners declaring sitin strike and gdansk shipyard on 
strike were draped on the main gate 
police detained bogdan lis a gdansk solidarity leader in 
nearby sopot said jankowski the solidarity chaplain 
according to andrzej gwiazda a solidarity leader the shipyard 
strikers demand minimum pay of 60000 zlotys a month 150

a twoweek sitin at a wesleyan 
university administration building ended monday after 110 students 
were arrested for blocking entrances to protest the schools 
investments in companies doing business in south africa 
middletown police put students on three buses to take them away 
from the building that houses the office of university president 
colin campbell about six hours after the blockade began none 
resisted arrest 
the blockade was obviously an escalation said bobby wayne 
clark a university spokesman 
the students were charged with creating a public disturbance and 
were all released on their own recognizance police said 
police intervention was sought only after the administration 
tried but failed to resolve the conflict internally putting the 
issue before the student judiciary board clark said 
the student board concluded that the protesters actions had 
crossed the line of tolerability and had become an invasion 
of the rights of other individuals to free access to a university 
facility 
clark said however that it was likely the cases against the 
students would be resolved within the university and that the 
charges would not be prosecuted 
the protest monday marked the second time in the last four years 
that there has been a mass arrest of students at wesleyan over the 
schools investment policies 
a spokesman for the protesters said they were dissatisfied with 
campbells response to their demands in all of his statements he 
has barely even begun to acknowledge that we are here said john 
stamm a senior from boston 
the antiapartheid protesters had been peacefully conducting a 
sitin to protest the private liberal arts colleges investment 
policies the school has about 103 million of its 240 million 
endowment invested in companies that conduct some form of business 
in south africa 
the students members of the divest now coalition of groups 
opposed to south africas racist policies decided to take a more 
militant approach sunday after the school failed to meet their 
divestment demands 
the coalition demanded that the university trustees social 
implications subcommittee open its process to include student 
representatives that the subcommittee recommend total divestment 
in a final report by may 8 and that the trustees hold a special 
meeting to vote for total divestment before the end of the school 
term classes end wednesday and exams end may 17 
but campbell told the students sunday that the subcommittee 
would continue to meet privately he promised that it would open 
its meeting on campus tuesday for about an hour to student 
representatives

some representatives of former dalkon shield 
users urged rejection monday of the latest reorganization plan 
involving ah robins manufacturer of the defective contraceptive 
device that injured thousands of women 
after an agonizing decisionmaking and education process we 
have found that the plan is unfair inadequate and contrary to the 
law karen hicks founder of the dalkon shield information 
network told a news conference 
however another representative of the victims atlantabased 
attorney guerry r thornton jr said the plan offered the best 
deal yet for the more than 196000 women harmed by the intrauterine 
device 
the 32 billion reorganization plan the sixth plan developed 
since robins filled for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1985 is part of 
the manhattanbased american home products corps agreement to 
take over the beleaguered company the 32 billion plan includes 
23 billion to be put in a trust fund for the victims 
the plan was presented in a mailing last week to all claimants 
against robins including the 196000 former dalkon shield users 
who have injury claims pending against robins as well as banks and 
stockholders 
all claimants are to mail in ballots by july 11 with the final 
resolution of the case scheduled for july 18 
in order for the plan to be approved under an arrangement set up 
in march by us district judge robert r merhige jr at least 
twothirds of the voters in each class of creditors must vote 
yes 
hicks said the courtdesignated dalkon shield committee assigned 
to represent the women who had used the device estimated that 
claims against the manufacturer would range from 42 billion to 7 
billion 
she contended that under the reorganization plan stockholders 
and other creditors would immediately be paid 100 cents on the 
dollar but that women filing claims against the company may receive 
only 35 cents to 50 cents on the dollar after administrative costs 
have been deducted the plan also gives the fund until the year 
2008 to pay the women 
the claimants are carrying the entire burden of all the 
unknowns in this case were being treated unfairly relative to 
other people hicks said 
ah robins spokesman rosco puckett said the company was 
satisfied with the plan which provides full funding for the 
amount of money the court has announced as needed for compensation 
and related administrative costs this is a plan of consensus which 
was endorsed by all executive committees 
the dalkon shield committee fought us tooth and nail for all 
32 months and they believe this is adequate it provides the 
full amount of money to satisfy the court he said 
hicks said that if the funds prove to be inadequate the former 
users have no legal recourse to sue the manufacturer or aetna 
casualty amp surety co the company that insured robins 
she contended that the plan violates bankruptcy law requiring 
that priority be given to settling claims like those of the former 
dalkon shield users before any stockholders are paid 
thornton who has been campaigning actively for adoption of the 
settlement said hicks was right about the law but he said the 
courts would uphold the arrangement because the judge found that it 
was fair 
if approved the award plus interest and approximately 300 
million from aetna brings the total to 27 billion a figure 
thornton said the victims couldnt get if they sold all of robins 
property on the open market 
the aetna funds come from cash payment in the bankruptcy suit 
and another 75 million settlement from a separate class action 
suit alleging the company had conspired with robins to withhold 
information about the dalkon shield thornton said 
for some people understandably you could get the us gross 
national product have ah robins behind bars and that would not 
be enough thornton said 
thornton said it would take another three or four years to match 
the offer from american home and said many of his clients were 
nearing the end of their childbearing years and desperately 
needed the money to finance infertility treatments they just dont 
have the time it would take to get this again

president john f kennedy would have supported 
his defense secretary robert mcnamara to succeed him in order to 
keep lyndon johnson out of the white house robert kennedy told 
interviewers 
the disclosure is contained in robert kennedy in his own 
words a book based on heretofore unpublished interviews kennedy 
gave between 1964 and 1967 excerpts appear in the current newsweek 
magazine the book is scheduled for release in june marking the 
20th anniversary of robert kennedys assassination 
in the excerpts robert kennedy is quoted as saying that his 
brother thought of trying to move in the direction that would get 
the nomination for mcnamara he said the president thought the 
country should be placed in the best possible hands and we 
thought that mcnamara was that individual 
speaking of johnson robert kennedy said in every 
conversation i have with him he lies he lies even when he 
doesnt have to 
kennedy who remained as attorney general a short while after 
his brother was assassinated in 1963 described johnson as mean 
bitter vicious an animal in many ways 
i think his reaction on a lot of things is correct but i 
think hes got this other side of him in his relationship with 
human beings which makes it very difficult unless you want to kiss 
his behind all the time thats what bob mcnamara suggested to me a 
couple of weeks ago if i wanted to get along no i cant do 
that 
kennedy also said johnson remarked to pierre salinger then the 
presidential press secretary that the slaying of the president 
was retribution for his participation in the assassinations of 
the onetime leaders of the dominican republic and south vietnam 
elsewhere in the interviews kennedy asserts that his brother 
opposed those assassinations 
after quitting the cabinet kennedy won election to the senate 
from new york and in 1968 was pursuing the presidential nomination 
after johnson decided not to seek reelection 
salinger told newsweek that sen eugene mccarthy tried to come 
to robert kennedys bedside just after he was fatally shot but 
salinger headed him off he said mccarthy around whom dumpjohnson 
sentiment had first coalesced told him what we should do now is 
create a coalition and go back to lyndon johnson tell him to run 
and well all support him 
the interviews were given as part of an oral history program for 
the john f kennedy library

the governing partys 
presidential candidate on monday appealed to the rightist 
opposition to help resolve a crisis that has split the legislature 
there is either going to be consensus or permanent impasse for 
three years and the country cannot withstand impasse adolfo rey 
prendes nominated at the christian democrats convention on 
friday told a news conference 
the crisis stems from a dispute over which party controls one 
seat in the 60seat national assembly the unicameral legislature 
that was elected march 20 
the rightwing republican national alliance or arena claims it 
won 31 seats during the election and that the christian democrats 
who had previously held a majority stole a seat through electoral 
fraud the christian democrats deny the charge 
arena has appealed the final vote count for the disputed seat to 
the supreme court but it was uncertain when the court would rule 
the rightists maintain that for the moment the assembly has 59 
members 
the legislature was to have been inaugurated sunday for a 
threeyear term the 30 arena deputies showed up and declared 
congress in session 
but the 30 other deputies 23 for the christian democrats and 
seven for the national conciliation party gathered in another 
room and held their own session 
the christian democrats claimed the legislature no longer exists 
because the constitution says that half plus one of the 
assemblys 60 members must be on hand for it to be installed or to 
act 
as of today there is no national legislature rey prendes 
said 
but alfredo cristiani president of arena said only a majority 
of the elected deputies is needed to install the congress he said 
his party has that majority in a 59member assembly 
rey prendes said he believes the politicians can work things out 
this kind of confrontation serves no ones purposes except 
those of the guerrillas who sit calmly in the mountains watching 
us destroy each other he said 
leftist rebels have been fighting the ussupported government 
since 1980 
arena exhibited its growing power with the upset in the 
legislative elections the christian democrats had 33 seats in the 
previous national assembly 
leftist guerrillas ordered vehicles to stay off el salvadors 
roads for an indefinite period beginning tuesday the transport 
ban the third called this year was announced monday on the 
rebels clandestine radio venceremos 
previous transport bans were enforced by rebels who burned the 
vehicles of violators 
the rebels said the measure was in response to an increase in 
repression by the armed forces and police

a twoweek national strike over gasoline 
price increases ended monday after negotiations between government 
and unions the labor ministry said the strikes had paralyzed 
medical and banking services 
after talks with eight union leaders the government agreed to 
labors main demand that four detained union leaders be freed 
labor minister aboubacar umar said in a statement he made no 
mention of a second union demand that there be no further gasoline 
price increases 
there was no immediate comment from union leaders nor were the 
names of those being released immediately made available

percent demonstrations turned violent april 13 when thousands of 
university students and jos residents clashed with police with six 
people killed

what was expected to be the first of a series of increases the 
action followed world bank and international monetary fund 
recommendations to make gasoline prices higher to help reduce 
nigerias 15 billion budget deficit 
many nigerians have considered low gasoline prices as their 
right since the boom days for oilexporter nigeria in the 
mid1970s even with the increases gas sells for about 40 cents a 
gallon

holding many union officials including the chairman of the joint 
committee for industrial unions and the assistant secretary of the 
national association of nurses and midwives 
last week the news agency reported the president and 
secretarygeneral of the national railwaymens union were arrested 
though rail workers did not join the strike

bail friday a judge said they could get three years in prison if 
convicted of taking part in walkouts the government dismissed

leaders of the nicaraguan contra rebels met monday 
amid signs that their troops are running short of supplies and some 
field commanders are demanding removal of their military chief 
contra directors polled their top military officers monday over 
the fate of col enrique bermudez confirmed rebel spokesman jorge 
rosales 
we are working on obtaining signatures of all the field 
commanders said rosales 
sources close to the contras said some of the five directors 
were expected to demand bermudezs firing at the meeting in miami 
in honduras walter calderon lopez known as cmdr tono gave 
interviews over the weekend saying as many as 30 senior contra 
commanders had signed a petition demanding bermudezs ouster 
bermudez has to go tono said the movement cannot 
continue with him in charge 
he said bermudez a former colonel in the hated national guard 
of deposed dictator anastasio somoza debayle has recently been 
surrounding himself with other former guardsmen 
and tono accused bermudez of condoning and possibly 
participating in skimming profits from us military aid 
the controversy over bermudez follows a week of reports that 
contra director adolfo calero had led an unsuccessful move to fire 
the military chief running up against the opposition of fellow 
director aristides sanchez 
sources said sanchez has indicated privately that if bermudez is 
fired he may quit the directorate of the nicaraguan resistance as 
the contras are formally known sanchez is considered the most 
hardline of the five directors and has the closest ties to the 
field troops 
the battle over bermudez was not the contras only worry 
however 
their soldiers situation has worsened as the ruling sandinistas 
have refused to allow food and nonlethal supplies to reach rebels 
the contras accuse the sandinistas of reneging on the agreement 
signed in sapoa nicaragua in march that said the aid would be 
allowed in during negotiations the contras issued minutes of that 
meeting monday aimed at showing the sandinistas had agreed to the 
aid 
rosales said the sandinistas are now demanding concessions in 
return for the food and supplies 
they are trying to blackmail us with hunger said rosales 
it is a difficult situation the aid must begin immediately 
the sandinistas offered to have the international committee of 
the red cross deliver the humanitarian aid but the contras 
insisted they have the right to say who delivers it and they see 
red cross as sympathetic to sandinistas 
the agreement says the rebels may receive aid through a neutral 
organization once they are in the ceasefire zones 
when the rebel leaders returned from nicaragua on sunday after 
the latest round of unsuccessful peace talks with the sandinistas 
contra director pedro joaquin chamorro bitterly criticized the 
handling of the aid issue 
they are hinging the entire ceasefire agreement on how goods 
will be delivered instead of on the democratization of nicaragua 
chamorro said we had already agreed on how the goods will be 
delivered and now they bring it up again 
the rebel leaders expressed outrage during the talks saying the 
government had reneged on promises and created an oppressive 
atmosphere that jeopardizes future talks in nicaragua 
the next round of talks have been tentativley set for may 1224 
and calero said he hopes they will be held outside nicaragua

panama has paid nothing to the world bank for 
six months on the 502 million owed to it the bank announced 
monday 
as a consequence the banks loans to panama have been placed in 
a nonaccrual status which means the bank will no longer 
include on its own statements the interest and other charges due 
from panama until money is actually received 
the bank owned by 151 countries is the biggest single source 
of aid money for the third world the united states is the largest 
shareholder 
placing loans in a nonaccrual status is an accounting action 
which does not reduce in any way the countrys obligation to the 
bank or the banks ability to assist the country in formulating 
policies to help redress its economic difficulties the 
announcement said 
last nov 30 the bank stopped disbursing loans to panama as it 
does to any borrowing country whenever payments on earlier loans 
are more than 75 days overdue 
panamas financial situation has been deteriorating for almost a 
year because of the political crisis there and its been 
aggravated by us actions taken to try to oust strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega who was indicted earlier this year in 
florida on drugtrafficking charges 
the situation became critical feb 26 the day noriega 
engineered the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle for issuing 
an order firing the general 
panama has 118 banks and has been a major latin american 
financial center but the banks have been closed to the public by 
government order since march 4 because of cash shortages following 
monthslong runs on accounts and a us freeze on panamanian 
assets some panamanian and foreign banks reopened april 18 but 
only to accept deposits

opposition party leaders met monday 
to study reports that strongman gen manuel antonio noriega made a 
deal with the us government to resign 
it was the first known meeting between the party leaders in the 
nearly yearlong crisis 
we met to discuss jointly the grave situation of our country 
and what we may do together to find a democratic solution for our 
country ricardo arias calderon of the christian democrat party 
told the associated press the meeting was at his home 
other sources at the session said representatives of six 
political parties met for more than two hours 
one source speaking with the condition he not be identified 
said the leaders discussed everything that has to do with the 
serious crisis including the reported arrangement between 
washington and noriega commander of the 15000member defense 
forces 
he did not elaborate on the talks 
us officials in washington said friday that noriega had agreed 
to step down as the military chief but refused to leave panama as 
the united states and the panamanian opposition had wanted 
us treasury secretary james a baker said sunday that talks 
with noriega continued during the weekend and that progress is 
being made 
noriega on saturday denied he had made any commitments to us 
envoys 
opposition leaders were alarmed at the report that noriega might 
be allowed to remain in the country even if he did resign they 
said such a change in the us stand would be a serious mistake 
that would not solve panamas problems or bring democratization to 
the country 
the christian democrats called the meeting and representatives 
were sent by the authentic panamanian party the republican party 
of ousted president eric arturo delvalle the liberal republican 
nationalist movement and factions of the liberal and labor parties 
the authentic panamanian party is the largest opposition party 
followed by the christian democrats 
delvalle was removed by the noriegacontrolled legislature on 
feb 26 the day after he tried to fire the general 
noriega was indicted by a federal grand jury in florida last 
february on drugtrafficking charges which he denies 
sources in the opposition said earlier that their leaders were 
afraid the united states was bypassing them and ignoring promises 
to them 
they said if noriega quits but remains in panama he would 
continue to wield power through the defense forces 
he would continue to be a focus of controversy arias 
calderon said 
the opposition also insists that chief executive manuel solis 
palma named to replace delvalle not be allowed to remain in 
office until the may 1989 elections 
demonstrations demanding noriegas ouster began last summer 
after noriegas former secondincommand publicly accused the 
general of involvement in political assassinations electoral fraud 
and corruption 
the united states imposed economic sanctions on panama after 
noriega was indicted on drug charges

the united auto workers and chrysler 
corp moved closer to a national contract settlement monday after 
wrapping up all but final details of related agreements covering 
former american motors corp workers in wisconsin a union official 
said 
it means now we can turn our full attention to the national 
talks theyre going very well uaw vice president marc stepp 
said adding that since last week chrysler managements attitude 
has changed for the positive 
uaw president owen bieber who on monday joined national 
contract talks covering 66000 chrysler workers in 15 states said 
chrysler and the uaw reached tentative settlements on a master pact 
covering all former amc workers in wisconsin and a local contract 
covering 6500 workers in kenosha wis 
we had to get this piece settled before we could settle the 
rest there was no way that we were going to put together the 
national agreement and let these people hang out there by 
themselves bieber said 
now we can get down to the bigger things he said adding 
the only deadline set for finishing national contract talks is as 
soon as we possibly can 
the fouryear kenosha pact covers 5500 workers who will be laid 
off in the closing of an assembly plant at years end and 1000 
workers at an engine plant that will remain open 
the master wisconsin pact which covers all uaw workers who were 
employed by amc in the state when chrysler bought the ailing 
automaker in august will give kenosha workers about 88 percent or 
57 million of nearly 65 million amc owed them said chrysler 
spokesman lloyd northard he said 22 million of the 57 million 
already was paid in 1985 
the kenosha payments which will average between 6000 and 
8000 per worker will be 100 percent of the money amc borrowed 
from workers early in the decade but will not include interest amc 
had promised northard said about 9000 workers including those 
employed by 1982 at one time or another between 1982 and 1987 will 
be eligible for the payments northard said 
under the same pact about 200 milwaukee workers at a parts 
depot and 425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive the 
same percentage of more than 5 million amc owed them under the 
master pact 
bieber said the master pact would guarantee laidoff workers six 
months of supplemental unemployment benefits which are paid in 
addition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95 percent 
of regular pay in addition it makes it easier for workers to 
retire early and matches pension benefits to those at general 
motors corp and ford motor co he said 
chrysler and the union are negotiating their national contract 
along the lines of an industrypattern contract established last 
fall at gm and ford but have adapted some elements including a 
crucial jobsecurity provision 
talks on chryslers contract which expires sept 14 opened 
april 18 last week the wisconsin talks were moved to detroit so 
bargainers for both sides could negotiate all contracts 
simultaneously 
the tentative kenosha local pact appears similar to a fiveyear 
agreement reached in october covering jeep plant workers in toledo 
ohio both pacts give the company more flexibility in using workers 
ed steagall president of uaw local 72 at kenosha said about 20 
percent of the kenosha workers will be able to retire early and 
laidoff kenosha workers will have first crack at any new jobs at 
the engine plant there 
nick romano president of local 75 in milwaukee said he also 
was pleased with the settlements which will be voted on by next 
week 
i feel good about whats happening i dont feel good about 
our plant being terminated in milwaukee he said

israeli troops supported by helicopter 
gunships and tanks thrust into southeastern lebanon monday in 
search of palestinian guerrillas police reported 
israel said its troops had moved into israels selfdeclared 
security zone in southern lebanon 
the army is combing the security zone because of increasing 
attempts to infiltrate into israel for purposes of murder and 
hostagetaking an israeli military communique said 
it did not say how long the operation would last or how many 
troops were involved the communique was issued by the military in 
the northern israeli town of metulla 
the army censored other details about the operation 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 500 to 1500 
israeli soldiers were dispatched to the border region before the 
operation began 
lebanese police said reports from the arkoub region in the 
foothills of mount hermon indicated at least three suspected 
guerrillas had been seized by the israelis in the late evening 
operation 
the area is in the western sector of the syriancontrolled bekaa 
valley 
we have no information yet about the size of the attacking 
force or the distance it covered in the penetration said a 
spokesman at lebanons police headquarters in beirut he was not 
identified in line with police regulations 
he declined comment on a report by nbc news that said about 
2000 israeli troops had crossed into lebanon in search of 
palestine liberation organization guerrillas and their strongholds 
last week palestinian guerrillas entered northern israel from 
southeastern lebanon in two different incursions five guerrillas 
and two soldiers were killed in fights with israeli army patrols 
there have been 12 infiltrations or attempted infiltrations 
since nov 25 when a palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider 
near a military base and killed six soldiers before being shot to 
death 
israeli officials said recent crossborder raids probably were 
linked to the five months of antiisraeli demonstrations in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
an arab youth died sunday when he was electrocuted while 
climbing a utility pole at the west bank village of beit wazan 
hospital officials reported relatives of the victim nidal 
abdulhak 16 said he was killed when israeli troops ordered him to 
climb the pole to remove a palestinian flag 
the army said abdulhak apparently was trying to hang the flag 
which is outlawed by israel 
his death brought the number of arabs killed since the uprising 
began dec 8 to at least 177 an israeli soldier and jewish settler 
also have been slain in the violence 
there have been reports of an israeli military buildup since 
guerrilla incursions last week the israeli military censor on 
monday prevented journalists in israel from reporting details about 
the buildup 
israeli officials have blamed syria for the crossborder 
guerrilla attacks on grounds the guerrillas were from the bekaa 
valley that is controlled by syrian forces 
timur goksel spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon 
was asked about the report of 2000 israeli soldiers crossing into 
lebanon 
an operation of that magnitude would have to through the 
unifil area and we see nothing he told the associated press in 
jerusalem by telephone from his headquarters in the the lebanese 
border town of naqoura 
in the area we see and control we dont see anything goksel 
said unifil has peacekeeping units in southern lebanon 
the police spokesman said the attacking force was supported by 
militiamen of the israeliallied south lebanon army a 
predominantly christian paramilitary contingent in control of 
israels selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
squadrons of israeli air force jet fighters soared over south 
lebanons two major cities of sidon and tyre dropping parachute 
flares and staging mock divebombing runs on palestinian refugee 
camps the spokesman said 
the drone of warplane engines also was heard over beirut the 
lebanese capital but there have been no reports of bombing sorties 
the israeli military said that last wednesday two palestinian 
guerrillas from lebanon crossed israels border and wounded a truck 
driver before they were trapped in a ravine and slain by an army 
patrol no army casualties were reported 
an army statement said documents found on the dead guerrillas 
showed they planned to take hostages to exchange for arab prisoners 
in israeli jails 
the day before three guerrillas crossed the border at the same 
point and were spotted by an army patrol the army said the three 
guerrillas and two soldiers were killed in a gunfight

maryland democrats monday rallied around 
us rep roy p dyson following the weekend suicide of his top 
aide and republicans began talking about mounting a stronger 
challenge for the congressmans seat 
dyson remained in seclusion monday following the death of his 
administrative assistant tom pappas who plunged 16 stories to his 
death sunday from the window of his manhattan hotel room 
the washington post carried a frontpage story the same day 
quoting former dyson aides as saying the congressman had ceded 
control of his office to pappas who recruited single young men as 
employees and pressured them to socialize with him 
before his death pappas 46 talked with friends about the 
article which quoted staff members as complaining of his unusual 
demands including that one unidentified employee perform a 
striptease at a staff retreat the post reported monday 
police said pappas left a poem on hotel stationery an officer 
who saw it said the unsigned eightline verse spoke of the dark 
and ugly world and ended with a reference to crashing the 
new york times reported in tuesdays editions 
goodbye was neatly printed on the sheet which was lined 
notebook paper rather than stationery and bore no addressee the 
times said 
dyson pappas and todd skipper another aide were in new york 
to meet with a lawyer and attend the broadway musical phantom of 
the opera police there said 
dyson and skipper were interviewed by police sunday dysons 
office which said it did not know the lawmakers whereabouts 
issued a brief statement monday from dyson expressing sympathy to 
pappas friends and family 
tom was my friend and political ally for almost two decades 
dyson said all of us who had the privilege of working with him 
will miss him more than we can say 
democratic officials predicted dyson 39 would win reelection 
in november although they said his reaction to pappas death would 
be crucial 
i dont think roy has any trouble i think roy is popular in 
his 1st congressional district marylands democratic gov william 
donald schaefer said 
john willis vice chairman of the state democratic party said 
dysons standing with the voters is good enough that hell be 
able to weather this but he cautioned that dysons reaction to 
this is going to be the key 
republican leaders said they are thinking of asking wayne 
gilchrest a political novice who won the partys nomination in the 
march primary to consider stepping aside so a betterknown 
candidate can challenge dyson but they said they wont try to 
force out gilchrest 
the nomination was won fair and square by wayne gilchrest and 
i think we have to take our lead from him nelson warfield 
executive director of the maryland republican party said 
our role is to explain to him exactly what is involved in 
being a challenger 
the baltimore evening sun quoted gilchrest as saying he 
expects to be asked to quit but that he does not plan to step 
aside 
former rep robert bauman a republican who lost the seat to 
dyson in 1980 said pappas death could hurt him dyson it 
could defeat him but i think it depends on the further revelations 
about what drove mr pappas to his suicide 
i would warn the republican party my own party not to make 
an issue of this bauman added 
bauman lost the seat to dyson in 1980 after bauman was charged 
with soliciting sex from a 16yearold male prostitute in 
washington the charge was later dropped although bauman 
acknowledged he was homosexual and an alcoholic 
the new york medical examiners office said an autopsy showed 
pappas death was caused by multiple internal and external 
injuries pappas fell from his 24thfloor room to an eighthfloor 
ledge 
spokeswoman ellen borakove said toxicology tests performed over 
the next week to 10 days would determine whether drugs or alcohol 
were present in his system an official classification of his 
death which police have called a suicide will await the test 
results she said 
the post article came as the federal election commission 
investigated allegations dysons campaign disclosure reports 
concealed 6650 in payments to pappas 
political consultant michael ford said he talked by phone with 
pappas about the post article for 25 minutes sunday morning pappas 
told ford he was worried that the article had irreparably damaged 
his career and had hurt dysons reelection chances the post 
reported monday 
i told him youve done nothing illegal youve done nothing 
immoral and therefore i think you can deal with this ford said 
adding he didnt think pappas was particularly depressed

washington ap the supreme court in an antitrust ruling that 
could make bargainhunting more difficult said monday that 
manufacturers do not always act illegally when they agree with 
retailers to stop supplying discount stores 
by a 62 vote the court said such action by a manufacturer 
becomes illegal only when it includes some agreement on price or 
price levels 
the ruling makes it easier for manufacturers to avoid antitrust 
liability when acting on requests from competing retailers they 
stop doing business with stores that cut prices

eggs laid by hens that were fed fish oil 
reduced blood pressure and blood fats in a small group of people 
and unlike regular eggs didnt raise their cholesterol levels a 
scientist said monday 
the eggs used in the study smelled and tasted like fish but 
that could probably be avoided by feeding hens deodorized fish oil 
suk y oh an associate professor of nutrition at the university of 
utah said during the annual meeting of the federation of american

if ohs preliminary findings are confirmed in a larger study 
consumption of such eggs will not increase the risk of developing

as soviet troops prepare to withdraw from 
afghanistgan the indian government has ordered a strengthening of 
its guard along the border with pakistan here in punjab state 
prime minister rajiv gandhi took the step out of concern that 
arms that might no longer be needed in afghanistan would find their 
way to sikh militants fighting to secede from india and form a 
nation of their own 
afghanistan is on the other side of pakistan from here 
india has accused pakistan of facilitating what it calls 
narcoterrorism by which the sikh militants buy arms with 
money from heroin smuggling pakistan denies the allegation 
gandhi ordered 3000 more men to police the border in punjab 
raising the frontier force to 18000 he also directed the punjab 
state government to begin building a barbedwire fence along the 
frontier 
but some borderguard officials doubt this can stop all illegal 
traffic 
sealing the border is not like licking and sealing an 
envelope said jasmer singh a senior officer in indias border 
security force it is impossible to completely stop transborder 
movement 
the punjabpakistan border is 340 miles long 
smuggling has long been prevalent in the region pakistans 
lowerpriced gold and textiles for example find eager markets in 
india 
in recent years the smugglers have added narcotics and 
automatic rifles 
sikh militants allegedly involved as both smugglers and buyers 
need the arms to sustain their sixyear guerrilla campaign for a 
sikh homeland so far this year they have killed more than 800 
people 
punjab police say most of the killings have been carried out 
with chinesemade ak47 rifles diverted from the afghan rebels 
since last early this year the sikh extremists have added 
rocketpropelled grenades and shoulderfired antiaircraft 
missiles to their arsenal 
president zia ulhaq of pakistan has denied giving aid or 
support to the sikh militants gandhi nonetheless still maintains 
that pakistan both harbors the extremists and even provides cover 
fire when they make border crossings 
the areas rugged terrain makes the frontier difficult to seal 
in some places as here in dhinda on the northernmost tip of 
punjab farmers on both sides cultivate land right up to the 
border which often is marked only by a short white pillar 
singh the border security officer said how can we stop two 
farmers sharing a hookah pipe and exchanging packets 
in other border areas sixfoot elephant grass makes clandestine 
movement easy at some places river valleys and shifting 
tributaries make it difficult to even determine where the border is 
indias policing efforts include observation towers a little 
over a mile apart patrols stay within 500 yards of each other and 
after dark border troops use nightvision binoculars and 
searchlights 
but the searchlights sometimes lose electric power said chaman 
lal a deputyinspector general in the border force 
we suspect it is arranged he added he said the government 
should provide separate power lines for the searchlights instead of 
relying on connections from border villages 
d s kalha the district commissioner at gurdaspur one of 
three punjab districts bordering pakistan talked of even more 
elaborate projects in store to seal the border 
the government plans to ban cultivation up to 500 meters 
1640 feet from the border and create a no mans land he said 
later this area will be fenced off and mined 
even if security measures succeed in punjab smugglers have 
alternative routes to india 
jasmer singh noted that the border in gujarat state to the south 
cuts through hardtopatrol swamps while in neighboring rajasthan 
state it passes through desert 
they can bring arms through rajasthan where observation posts 
are set at least eight kilometers about five miles apart he 
said all they need is a fast camel and they have faster camels 
than we have

the writer has frequently been aboard us navy 
warships in the persian gulf as a member of the american press pool 
arranged by the pentagon in washington 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us navy is assigning various types 
of its more modern warships to the persian gulf to put them to the 
test in a combat environment 
while the oliver hazard perryclass guided missile frigates 
small vessels known as figs will continue to dominate the 
gulfbased middle east force the navy has assigned three of its 
modern spruanceclass destroyers to the waterway and for the first 
time in at least a year will have no guided missile cruisers on 
hand 
the cruisers none of them less than 20 years old have shared 
the brunt of gulf escort and patrol duties with the frigates in the 
past year 
the emphasis now is to be on more modern ships primarily the 
destroyers which one officer said will be the backbone of the 
navy in coming years 
assigning these and other types of ships to the gulf will give 
some balance to the overall surface fleet rather than having 
the combat experience concentrated in mostly older vessels said 
the officer speaking only on condition of anonymity 
at the time the guided missile frigate stark was hit and nearly 
sunk by an iraqi missile may 17 1987 the us middle east force 
had four to six members it more than doubled then tripled after 
the united states began escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers in 
july to protect them from iranian attack 
more than 50 of the navys 230plus surface combat ships have 
made their appearance in the gulf since then 
although it varies from week to week as ships arrive and depart 
the gulfbased force recently stood officially at 16 including six 
woodenhulled oceangoing minesweepers more than 30 years old and 
their mother ship the trenton 
several of the navys 31 spruanceclass destroyers 7810ton 
ships armed with a variety of longrange missiles have served with 
carrier battle groups supporting the gulf convoy operations from 
the arabian sea but none have been in the gulf until recently 
one reason officers say is that their longrange missiles and 
defensive weapons were not suitable for the confines of the gulf 
where closein missile attacks and armed speedboats are considered 
the major threats 
the same was true of the older adamsclass destroyers which 
were regulars in the middle east force for many years until the 
stark incident those ships built in the 1950s and 1960s are 
among the last of the navys world war iistyle vessels although 
with aluminum superstructures 
none of these ships carry the computerized gatling gun called 
sea whiz designed to knock down incoming cruise missiles with 
storms of spenturanium shells all other ships in the gulf have 
been equipped with the rapidfiring terminal defense and other 
improvised defenses 
recent arrivals were the spruanceclass destroyers obrien and 
merrill and the 25yearold guided missile destroyer joseph 
strauss they are being followed into the gulf by at least one 
other spruanceclass ship the john hancock 
the recent arrivals saw action during the april 18 clashes with 
iranian naval forces the strauss fired a harpoon missile that 
scored a direct hit on one of irans frigates and itself came under 
fire from iranian missiles 
since the stark 22 of its sister perryclass ships have been to 
the gulf and four more will soon do their 2month turns in the 
waterway 
in addition to the figs the list includes 10 of the navys 
17 1960svintage missile cruisers two of its seven helicopter 
assault carriers of the same era and a variety of amphbious 
landing ships no large aircraft carriers battleships 
stateofthe art aegis cruisers or nuclearpowered warships 
have operated in the gulf 
when they entered service in the late 1970s the boxylooking 
3700ton perryclass frigates were much criticized as inadequate 
for their intended role which was providing antisubmarine 
protection for battle groups 
but in the gulf the figs have carried the brunt of the 
escort duty and the punishment 
one frigate the reuben james set a tediumendurance record 
with more than a dozen transits during its twomonth duty tour 
another the samuel b roberts hit a mine april 14 but survived 
through the heroic efforts of its crew 
cmdr edward mann skipper of the frigate jack williams says 
the ships have proved in the gulf that they can handle almost any 
situation 
as late as 1980 admirals were still saying the ffgs didnt 
belong in the fleet said mann 42 of bucks county pa now we 
know they can steam they can deliver they have sustainability 
another officer asking not to be named said there was no doubt 
that the frigates have been ideally suited for the gulf assignment 
but theres also a need to give other types of ships and their 
crews the same chance for training under those conditions he 
said 
the pentagon announced the rotation of ships at an april 22 news 
briefing in an effort to forestall speculation that the united 
states was enlarging its gulfbased force following the oneday 
series of armed clashes with iran on april 18

isnt it just like that molly dodd tvs 
perplexed and perplexing quintessential struggling single woman 
to scramble nbcs neat little line of comedies that always rank 1 
2 3 4 in the nielsens 
last week the networks four thursday comedies the cosby 
show a different world and cheers with the days and 
nights of molly dodd bringing up the rear ranked 1 2 3 13 
yes thats our molly throwing a monkey wrench into the 
smoothrunning nbc comedy machine 
nbc put molly dodd into the night court slot in march 
night court was top 10 molly drops to the top 20 not good 
enough for no 1 nbc 
people who fall down laughing at the tatadum oneliners of 
cheers apparently dont adjust easily to the offbeat jazzy 
rhythms of tragicomic halfhour that follows and they are tuning 
out 
besides that the show has run in odd 13week spurts in the 
spring when prime time becomes a hodgepodge of repeats and 
shortrun series after the show completed its successful run last 
season there was no room for it in hitheavy nbcs fall schedule 
many fans presumed it had been canceled 
bob brush who writes the show with executive producer jay 
tarses complains that even after all the critical praise last 
season nbc gave the series little fanfare when it returned 
im thrilled with the show im happy its on the air and 
people are seeing it i would just like to see people get a chance 
to get used to it and know that its not like the other shows 
theyre watching brush said 
the show is dear the hearts of brush and tarses it is the first 
television experience for brush 40 formerly a broadway composer 
the first 
his wife sally faison who now plays mollys sister mamie had 
gone to hollywood for auditions so brush went along packing a 
script hed written it caught the attention of an agent who 
introduced brush to tarses the two said brush had a psychic 
sympathy 
it was brush who wrote this seasons episode in which mollys 
father died and it was profound touching poetic television 
entertaining her boss moss goodman in her apartment molly 
chatted happily as she went into the bathroom to get something 
there for a split second she saw the image of her father in a 
mirror when she turned it was gone then the phone rang 
cut to moss droning on about whether or not his stew is 
adequately jelling when he finally realizes molly isnt there he 
goes into the deserted living room where the phone is beeping off 
the hook 
it is these poignant scenes that seem to confound audiences used 
to solid yocks in halfhour television shows 
to deal with the new concept of 30minute dramas with comedy tv 
writers coined the term dramedy which the writers and 
producers of such shows detest as unnecessary pigeonholing 
if molly isnt a dramedy what does brush say it is 
i say that were writing a character piece that were really 
trying to write about a real person were trying to write a show 
about the human comedy which is not about jokes not about 
wordplay but has to do with getting to know a person who is not 
unlike almost everybody 
acknowledging thats a mouthful he adds ok so its 
dramedy 
but seriously 
i think one of the confusions that has happened is viewers 
tend to say how come i dont like molly more i think thats 
because were not out to say look we want to present you someone 
youll like were saying we want to present you someone you may 
recognize yourself in 
brush is writerproducer on tarses other show for abc the 
slap maxwell story it didnt do well in the ratings and its 
renewal is up for grabs too 
on top of that star dabney coleman wants to quit shooting the 
series onecamera like a movie and go to a threecamera sitcom 
style 
he has a vision of it which does not really square with my 
vision of the show said brush who opposes any moves to make the 
complex slap more likable 
i think what worked in the show when it worked was the fact 
that he could seem on one hand to be so callous and miserable but 
then what we could learn about was that there was a real 
sympathetic machine working underneath he said

the doyly carte opera company has been revived 
and is once again ready for the road with the rollicking songs of 
gilbert and sullivan that made it famous a century ago 
the company went out singing on feb 27 1982 with a 
performance of hms pinafore at londons adelphi theater 
dame bridget doyly carte the founders granddaughter was in 
that audience she died in 1985 and her will left the bulk of her 
78 million estate to trustees who had run the company until its 
demise 
the new company in the northeast town of sunderland opened a 
10day run of iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard on april 
28 
the gilbert and sullivan operas an art form as distinctly 
english as bowler hats and tea and crumpets remain hugely popular 
throughout the world productions of such hits as the mikado 
the pirates of penzance and hms pinafore regularly 
appear on stages from elementary schools to broadway 
we are riding the crest of a wave said richard condon the 
companys general manager if you look around the west end of 
london audiences are going for entertaining musicals and we are 
going for a lively style 
a threemonth tour through seven other cities in england and 
scotland follows the sunderland premiere and the company also 
hopes to book a run in london 
we are already talking about taking the company to the united 
states canada and australia condon said inquiries began 
coming in from agents as soon as we announced on march 1 that we 
were back 
the doyly carte company thrived for 107 years on the works of 
librettist sir william schwenck gilbert and composer sir arthur 
sullivan who collaborated on 14 operettas over 25 years 
the style was burlesque poking satirical fun at politics the 
law and society with outrageous puns and farfetched rhymes 
some gilbertian phrases entered everyday speech such as 
things are seldom what they seem the upper crust a 
policemans lot is not a happy one language that would make 
your hair curl and blow your own trumpet 
richard doyly carte founded the company in 1875 to stage the 
operettas and built the savoy hotel and the neighboring savoy 
theater from the proceeds 
royalties flowed in from thousands more productions abroad but 
there was widespread pirating 
in 1879 alone more than 150 unauthorized productions of hms 
pinafore played in 60 cities in the united states according to 
brian jones who edits the ws gilbert journal for gilbert and 
sullivan fans worldwide 
doyly carte hit back by staging his own hms pinafore in 
new york in 1879 and in 1880 he had five companies touring the 
united states 
condon said the new 103member company plans two operas a year 
and has new costumes new sets a chorus of 32 and an orchestra of 
33 
bramwell tovey the companys music director and formerly music 
director of the royal ballet has reexamined the surviving 
operetta scores and revived longforgotten notations and directions 
for years the old company clung to one directional format and 
maybe that led to its running out of steam said condon also 
as copyright on each work expired after 100 years the fall in 
royalties coincided with rocketing costs 
the original company lost 446500 in 1981 and had to cancel a 
us tour the governmentfunded arts council refused an appeal for 
help pronouncing the doyly carte style wooden and tired 
condon said 945000 was budgeted for the new iolanthe and 
yeomen

abdala bucaram a fiery populist 
leader from this roughandtumble port is given a chance of 
winning ecuadors presidency even though the roman catholic church 
newspapers and others object to his raucous style and language 
the prospect that bucaram leader of the populist roldosista 
party could win the presidential runoff election sunday has 
stirred rumors of a military coup and sent tremors through 
ecuadors financial circles 
the military sent him fleeing into exile once before 
his foes accuse him of appealing to class hatred in his 
speeches but bucarams response is that he is a champion of the 
poor 
campaigning recently in guayaquils steamy heat with his shirt 
tail hanging out he called himself a goodhearted slob and 
admits he may be a bit crazy 
but his opponent in the election rodrigo borja is taking 
bucarams challenge seriously 
political analysts say bucaram has a good chance of defeating 
borja a social democrat and leader of the democratic left party 
in the runoff 
in the first round jan 31 the 36yearold bucaram won second 
place in a field of 10 candidates with 153 percent of the vote to 
203 percent for the 52yearold borja 52 
the winner sunday will replace leon febres cordero a staunchly 
conservative prous political leader whose fouryear term ends 
in august 
this nation of 10 million people wedged between colombia and 
peru has suffered in recent years from severe economic problems 
and political instability sparked in great part by bitter disputes 
between febres cordero and leftleaning parties that control 
congress 
borja who narrowly lost to febres cordero in a runoff in 1984 
has pledged to reverse the current governments freemarket 
economic policies and seek close ties with the nonaligned 
movement also known as the third world 
borjas party is ecuadors largest but his chances are 
weakened many analysts say because he is viewed as a lackluster 
speaker without strong leadership ability 
bucaram who wears a hitlerstyle mustache and says he is an 
admirer of the nazi leaders organizational genius charged at 
one point in the campaign that an international jewish 
conspiracy was against him 
catholic church leaders and newspapers have assailed bucaram for 
his use of gutterlanguage in attacks on borja bucaram has called 
borja a drunkard and drug addict in television interviews he also 
has used unprintable street language to question his foes virility 
borja lacks strength spirit bucaram said hes a 
lukewarm man abdala is different he said of himself he 
awakens passions there is no middle ground with him 
the attacks have prompted borja a calm urbane lawyer to 
respond in kind calling bucaram an irresponsible clown and a 
fascist ignoramus 
i have been accused of everything in my political career from 
narcotics trafficker to thief bucaram said in a midnight 
interview outside his small thirdfloor walkup apartment on a 
garbagelittered downtown street 
bucaram has pledged to punish the oligarchy and crack down 
on wealthy tax evaders who he charges cheat the government of up 
to 500 million a year 
a vote for me is the same as scratching a mercedes benz with a 
bottle cap he told a cheering slum crowd alluding to such an 
act as defiance of the rich 
he has promised a shoe bank to provide free shoes for all 
poor children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum 
wage to 60 
his foes call him a demagogue for making such promises but 
acknowledge privately that bucaram is following in ecuadors 
tradition of populist leaders 
the late jose maria velasco ibarra won the presidency five 
times in good measure because of his inflammatory populist 
rhetoric he also was ousted four times in military coups 
bucaram was mayor of this city of 15 million people when he 
fled into exile in late 1985 to escape prison on a charge of 
slandering the armed forces a criminal offense in ecuador he had 
said all the military was good for was wasting money on parades 
in panama he was arrested on a charge of possessing five pounds 
of cocaine he claimed it was a frameup arranged by febres 
cordero a political enemy 
ecuadors congress granted him amnesty on the military offense 
and pressured panama into dropping the cocaine charge 
he returned in august 1987 to a heros welcome from his 
followers in guayaquils shantytowns 
bucaram is heir to a political dynasty of lebanese immigrants 
who settled in guayaquil ecuadors biggest city and its commercial 
hub his sister elsa was elected mayor of guayaquil in the 
general elections this past january 
even political foes say bucaram was successful in administering 
guayaquil a tough port city that has proved unmanageable for many 
mayors 
he won over hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers by paving 
streets piping in drinking water and providing other essential 
services 
he cracked down on street crime and kept the city clean by 
jailing anyone who let garbage pile up in front of his property

along with a new prosperity chinas industrial 
boom of the past decade has filled rural skies with smog poisoned 
wells and blackened streams 
the mushroomlike growth of small rural factories that burn coal 
and lack money or knowhow to clean up their wastes has made 
environmental pollution a nationwide problem 
the communist party leadership which long claimed that only 
profitdriven capitalist industries polluted the environment has 
begun to construct an environmental protection system the first 
environmental protection law was passed in 1979 several others 
setting standards for air and water purity have been approved since 
then 
a national environmental protection agency was created in 1984 
replacing a lowerlevel committee on the environment 
but the chemists technicians and enforcers in the new system 
are stretched thinly across the vast rural interior 
the estimated 20000 workers most without college degrees and 
with a minimum of special training have the power on paper at 
least to shut down factories impose heavy fines move industries 
from harmful locations and deny permission for construction of new 
ones 
in reality however they often must compromise when strict 
enforcement of standards could mean shutting down a towns main 
taxpayer or when the money to build treatment facilities is 
lacking 
the national environmental protection agency in beijing with 
100 staffers mainly analyzes pollution data leaving local 
agencies to do the enforcing 
we want to maintain the beauty of mountains and rivers said 
tang shidi head of the environmental office in panzhihua a small 
steel town surrounded by thickly forested mountains in central 
chinas sichuan province 
but on the other hand we have to support economic 
development he told a visitor to his office that he makes 
recommendations to local authorities when a new factory or office 
is built but acknowledged they were not always followed 
we have a principle to give active support to development 
and distribute industry rationally said liu yuncheng a 
deputy department chief at the national environmental protection 
agency 
but he acknowledged factories that provide most of the 
finances for localities and cause serious pollution problems are 
difficult to deal with 
encouraging rural industry has been a key element of the 
governments post1978 development drive small local factories 
now numbering 15 million have raised rural incomes and absorbed 
the surplus rural labor force 
these factories now account for more than a quarter of chinas 
industrial output which has more than tripled in the past decade 
to 372 billion 
liu said 40 percent of rural factories have pollution problems 
including 10 percent with serious problems most could be 
resolved fairly easily if funds were available he said 
government funds however fall far short of the need and are 
unlikely to increase at a time when farmers teachers and the army 
all are clamoring for more money from a treasury already in the red 
according to the national agency the state and industry spent 
135 billion last year to fight pollution officials estimated it 
would take three times that just to clean up shanghai a major city 
most of the money was spent in cities which are among the most 
smogridden in the world 
the official statistics on pollutants are daunting only one 
fourth of the 36 billion tons of waste water discharged from 
factories each year is treated few factory smokestacks have 
scrubbers to keep pollutants from rising into the air 
tang said that until a few years ago the golden sands river that 
supplies panzhihuas drinking water ran black because a coking 
plant dumped water laden with coal dust into the river now he 
said the waste water is filtered but the river still is 
threatened by discharges from a paper mill 
the official media have reported other examples 
in april two villagers in rural shaanxi province in north china 
drowned in industrial waste when the dam burst in a reservoir 
holding toxic chemicals from a mineral processing facility wells 
in the arid region were poisoned destroying the local residents 
water supply for perhaps years to come 
ninety percent of a 14825acre pine forest in sichuan was 
destroyed by acid rain from nearby sulfur processing plants 
rural pollution also spills over from cities the environmental 
protection agency said more than 200000 acres of farmland are 
buried under 75 billion tons of industrial waste from city plants

in the late 1940s construction of an underpass in washington 
dc effectively sealed off spencer howells novelty shop from the 
outside and buying world 
to keep on eating he broke the blockade by placing an ad in 
house amp garden offering tubes of whiskeyflavored toothpaste he 
sold 100000 before the year was out a bottle opener in the shape 
of dentures sold even better 
spencer howell had rediscovered a sales tool as ancient as the 
babylonians direct mail instead of waiting for the customers to 
come to you go to them 
some 6000 to 10000 catalog retailers the figure varies do 
just that 118 billion catalogs a year according to trade groups 
they range from titans such as ll bean in maine to lands end in 
wisconsin to sears roebuck and co anywhere to larry selman in 
santa cruz calif who sells glass paperweights from a 15 catalog 
including a toadstoolshaped antique you can have for 27000 
the average american home gets 50 catalogs a year a burdened 
letter carrier delivered 324 catalogs to this writer between last 
labor day and thanksgiving 
last year 88 million americans 512 percent of the adult 
population bought something by phone or mail direct mail has had 
a 15 percent annual growth 30 percent for upscale catalogs since 
1970 compared to 510 percent for store sales this is 83 percent 
of the nations general merchandise sales direct mail is a 
hightech almost scientific business which undoubtedly has the 
brains to overcome aprils 30 percent third class postal hike by 
becoming even more so 
little of this would have been possible without the computer 
the credit card and the 800prefix telephone number and above all 
the mailing list the mailing list stems from four of the more 
mundane items on this part of the planet the phone book census 
reports zip codes and your car registration 
mailing list compilers can get more info from these bare numbers 
and names than a biblical exegete could from the dead sea scrolls 
donnelley marketing one of the big compilers says it has more 
doctors of philosophy interpreting the data than the neighboring 
stamford conn hospital has doctors of medicine 
babylonian catalogs came on cuneiformed clay tablets after 
gutenberg invented movable type aldus manutius of venice had a 
catalog of books he published of greek and latin authors ben 
franklin who else put out a catalog of 600 books in 1744 
american colonials bought everything from lace cuffs to musket 
balls by mail from the mother country 
but montgomery ward is the direct father of todays direct mail 
his 1872 catalog promised farmers savings of up to 40 percent by 
eliminating the middleman for items ranging from harnesses to 
parasols the first compiler was not far behind 
he probably was lester martin clerk of story county iowa who 
discerned that the registrees of henry fords new tin lizzies were 
not only farmers but the wealthier of the breed such names might 
mean money martin got rights to the names and opened the m and f 
mailing co with his brotherinlaw reuben h donnelley another 
visionary bought them out in 1917 
this vision comes true daily at donnelleys computer operation 
in lincoln neb there the names and addresses from the nations 
2700 telephone books are laboriously converted to computer 
language says dick vincent donnelleys director of marketing 
services an average directory takes six weeks to computerize 
but whats in a name 
not a whole lot until those computers start comparing notes with 
other computers census data for instance tell how many people 
live at a phone address it gives particulars on value of home 
income 
the name begins to take on some flesh 
compare those results with motor vehicle registrations compiled 
by the rl polk co of taylor mich two cars at the same address 
maybe mom works an rv somebody goes camping station wagon kids 
sports car a carefree young in heart if not in fact a spender 
add some input from zip admittedly these can be misleading 
says larry heely a mailing list executive at direct media in port 
chester ny the same zip code in chicago contains the wealthy 
living in highrises along the lakefront and the decidedly 
unwealthy only a few blocks inland 
zips are not homogeneous says bill weisshahar at 
donnelleys computer facility in nevada iowa so some firms like 
claritas in chicago dissect who lives where within a zip and 
divides the united states into 250000 neighborhoods 
when i got out of college i moved into an apartment with 
orangecrate furniture and tacked posters on the wall for decor 
says dave chambers of claritas ive moved up and away but the 
new tenant probably still has orange crates and tacked posters 
birds of a feather flock together all the easier then to 
identify the flock 
this computerized database from national sources about half 
the states will sell vehicle registration lists is then 
inspected rejected and detected as closely as a 280pound woman 
discus thrower from behind the iron curtain 
almost everybody buys mailing lists from everybody else to try 
to find out who john and jane doe are behind the door at 000 main 
street centerville and just what it is they want to buy do they 
subscribe to the new yorker upscale money magazine strong 
evidence of loose change national geographic travelers armchair 
or actual field amp stream and live in rural colorado and own a 
camper john and jane are going to hear from eddie bauer and orvis 
if they buy a sleeping bag and a fly rod ll bean and norm 
thompson wont be far behind 
word in direct mail through list renting moves fast 
its mindboggling how many sources of data there are 
chambers says credit card applications mortgage loans alumni 
directories charitable donations building permits voting lists

many hospitals sell lists of new mothers thats grist for the 
baby catalogs and in time grist for kitchen appliances toys 
backtoschool wear home computers brides and eventually 
particularly if the addressee has had the same phone for 30 years 
empty nest catalogs 
to keep all this straight lists are continually subjected to 
mergepurge eliminating duplications merging the newly born and 
purging the newly departed since even direct mail cannot reach 
beyond the grave 
omaha steaks international say will take a hint from this 
list one from another and make a very educated guess as to whos 
entertaining a lot having first of course crosschecked with the 
vegetarian list maybe it will be a jaguar owner in an upscale zip 
code with a bouncing new mortgage on a showplace address who 
subscribes to gourmet and gentlemans quarterly and recently bought 
a crystal table set from bloomingdales by mail 
when a customer makes his first purchase we generally dont 
make money says omaha president fred simon but if we give him 
good service and a good product he becomes a member of our family 
its a process of time 
you test test test says dick vincent if you use a tool 
list for golfers youll lose your shirt you use a lot of little 
sample mailings you dont go for broke on one mailing or you will 
the thing about direct mail is that it is measurable you 
spend x dollars for a mailing and you get y back in facetoface 
retailing you can make a lot of mistakes before they catch up to 
you 
to help avoid database generalities donnelley periodically 
sends out questionnaires to the public with free coupons to entice 
a return more food for the computer 
success in direct mail is not assured reasons for failure are 
emphatic if you rent 20 lists and 19 bomb you know you sent 
your catalog at the wrong time or it was lousy heely says it 
wont be because you rented duds for reasons related to the golden 
rule list renters dont trade off lemons a list of heavy buyers 
means higher fees to the renters 
the more people buy the more their habits desires and depth of 
pocket becomes known and targeted by more catalogs to the 
evergrowing number of twoearner families this means broader 
chances for convenience shopping no traffic jams on the way to the 
mall or parking hassles once there no tugsofwar at bargain 
counters no sassy or dumb clerks 
instead the catalog house has a friendly knowledgeable voice 
at the end of an 800 number to answer any problem and assure the 
customer he or she isnt buying a blind pig in a blind poke its 
a lot less expensive to keep the customer happy than to try to find 
a new one says lisa caugherty of the direct marketing 
association in new york a trade group 
this is no more than ben franklin guaranteed when he assured his 
customers who live remote by sending their orders and money to 
the said b franklin may depend on the same justice as if 
present 
a catalog buy is an act of faith based on a picture of something 
seen but never touched buyer satisfaction is deferred if you 
dont receive the goods promptly the perceived need for it goes 
away and the emotional reward goes away too says jovon 
tucker a new york catalog consultant so one of the first 
commandments of direct mail is thou shalt fill orders promptly if 
not sooner 
years ago entry into direct mail was almost as easy as licking 
a stamp lillian vernon katz a 24yearold housewife scraped up 
2000 in the early 1920s placed 495 worth of ads for matching 
purses and belts and offered to monogram them free lillian vernon 
did 115 million in sales last year 
richard thalheimer started up his sharper image catalog by 
writing clever copy and offering oddball items such as a suit of 
15th century armor for 2450 gary comer a former ad copywriter 
started lands end as a yacht supplier then tacked downwind to 
become one of the biggest clothing mailers 
omaha steaks was a local food supplier until 1952 when fred 
simons father heeded friends requests to mail meats to their 
friends the stampede was on 
mom and pop still might just conceivably start a catalog today 
over the kitchen table but they better have 500000 up front 
and be able to sweat it out for two years says larry heely 
its a very crowded mail box says jovon tucker she helped 
jr carroll an irish tobacco company spend over 5 million with 
the help of marketing psychologists and all the scifi of madison 
avenue to prepare their recent debut into direct mail with an 
upupscale catalog full of enticing photos of wares to equip your 
own buckingham palace by 
the day of the dinosaur catalogs like montgomery wards 
recently abandoned are over she says catalogs today are 
aimed at lifestyles 
mass marketing is dead pronounced vincent now its 
databased magazines have a lot of wasted circulation tv is too 
broad 
this is both an opportunity and a challenge for the mailing 
list fred simon of omaha steaks aims at a broad market of buyers 
of high quality average catalog purchases are somewhere between 
35 and 50 a paperweight catalog has a far narrower focus 
claritas helps by breaking down zip codes into categories it 
tells you where to find such socioeconomic groupies they identify 
as money and brains furs and station wagons pools and patios 
young influentials towns and gowns academics in nonmetropolitan 
areas gods country welleducated frontier types coalburg and

editors note more than 4300 roman catholic schools have 
closed since the mid1960s and enrollment in parochial schools has 
been cut in half to see what can be done to reverse this decline 
the leaders of 22 catholic organizations are gathering in dayton 
ohio for a weeklong summit as one church leader says the 
issues on the agenda are gigantic 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was once almost an article of faith for new 
roman catholic parishes they built the parochial school first and 
held sunday mass in the auditorium the church building could wait 
until later 
thats the way they did it at most precious blood parish in 
northeast baltimore the altar and pews were placed right in the 
middle of the twostory brick school building which opened in 
1960 the church the parish figured would rise later on the 
vacant lot across the driveway 
but the baby boom ended the church was never built the 
parishioners aged and their children moved to the suburbs to start 
their own families 
next month most precious blood school will join a casualty list 
of 4300 catholic schools that have closed since the mid1960s 
even with tuition starting at 1100 a year the school ran a 
deficit last year of 86000 made up from the dwindling resources 
of a parish of 400 families 
mary barlow a nurse who sent her three children to the school 
was on the committee that recommended closing the school there was 
no fight 
its not that we gave up easily but we had to take the 
interests of the few and think of the whole parish she said 
how do you ask an older group of people to raise a 100000 
subsidy its impossible its unchristian 
schools like most precious blood have been squeezed in the vise 
of rising costs and declining enrollments that persist despite some 
studies that show catholic schools achieve better academic results 
especially for minority students and send more students to college 
than their public counterparts 
catholic schools have lost 3 million students since 1964 
including 103000 last year alone when 110 schools closed this 
years enrollment of 2623000 is down 38 percent from a year ago 
and off 53 percent from the peak of 56 million in 1964 
the catholic population actually has grown over that same period 
and become more prosperous but as catholics moved to the suburbs 
the schools did not follow them 
pastors no longer have the large armies of sisters and 
brothers especially the sisters to staff the schools says 
sister catherine t mcnamee president of the national catholic 
educational association ncea 
nuns and priests taught 75 percent of the classes in catholic 
schools in 1960 today nearly 83 percent of the 140000 teachers 
at 8992 catholic schools are lay women and men 
neither the parishes nor the dioceses nor the catholic people 
as a whole were really prepared to absorb the costs that came about 
after vatican ii as many nuns left their orders and some of 
those who remained chose ministries other than teaching mcnamee 
says 
this thursday may 19 mcnamee and the leaders of 21 other 
catholic organizations will gather in dayton ohio for a weeklong 
summit to try to forge a common vision for the future of catholic 
education in america 
the issues on the agenda are gigantic says mcnamee whose 
organization began working with the us catholic conference three 
years ago to lay the groundwork for the symposium called the 
catholic education futures project 
they will be exploring ways to spare other innercity parochial 
schools the fate of most precious blood perhaps through new 
financial arrangements and organizing catholic schools by region 
and clusters of parishes instead of as single parish entities 
the symposium at the university of dayton also will explore 
religious education for the majority of catholic children who do 
not attend catholic schools and adult instruction 
the rev thomas g gallagher the us catholic conferences 
secretary for education and a prime mover behind the dayton 
meeting says its probably the first time in 20 years that 
these groups involved in one form or fashion of catholic education 
have ever had the opportunity to sit down we are not only 
preparing ourselves for the future but preparing the future for 
us we can shape the future 
the baltimore archdiocese already has started trying to revamp 
its parochial schools in a 1986 pastoral letter archbishop 
william d borders spoke of the need to adopt an interparochial 
school structure and to set tuition at full cost with tuition 
assistance for families unable to pay the full freight 
the schools are to be run not by individual pastors or parish 
councils but independent catholic school boards in each of 12 
regions of the archdiocese which stretches from the chesapeake to 
cumberland md 
were being looked at by other dioceses all over the 
country says lawrence callahan the archdioceses superintendent 
of schools we really have taken a position that has been 
somewhat unpopular among our people

baltimore the first archdiocese in the united states was the 
site of three 19th century plenary councils that gave impetus to 
creation of the worlds largest system of catholic schools 
the american bishops at their third plenary council here in 
1884 proclaimed near every church when it does not already 
exist a parochial school is to be erected within two years from 
the promulgation of this council and to be kept up in the future 
unless in the judgment of the bishop the erection and maintenance 
of the school is impossible 
any priest gravely negligent in erecting the school or 
running it can and must be removed from that church the 
bishops decreed all catholic parents are bound to send their 
children to parochial schools 
catholic schools existed as far back as colonial days but their 
numbers grew in step with catholic immigration in the mid1800s 
and beyond to the big cities of the east there according to 
university of virginia sociologist james davison hunter they 
provided havens for catholics committed to preserving their 
ethnic and religious heritage in a protestantdominated society 
but in the modern era as catholics prospered and grew more 
comfortable with life in a pluralistic and secular united states 
they came to rely less on their parochial schools hunter says 
the bishops injunction to catholic parents fell by the wayside 
the fact of the matter was we didnt have enough room says 
gallagher of the us catholic conference you couldnt go out 
and tell everybody to put their youngsters in a catholic school 
and you cant lay a guilt trip on parents who cant afford it 
the catholic school enrollment slump has hit elementary schools 
the hardest high schools often were organized by region or diocese 
to begin with or sponsored by such orders as the jesuits or 
sisters of the sacred heart and they drew from a wider base than 
parish schools 
in 1965 baltimore had 113 elementary schools with 61000 
students today it has 86 with 24000 a quartercentury ago 80 
percent of its teachers were nuns drawing stipends of 600 a year 
today the archdiocese pays the nuns 7000 while lay teachers 
salaries start at 12416 almost 6000 below the scale in 
baltimore public schools 
as recently as 1970 most baltimore catholic schools charged 
less than 100 tuition a year even at tuition rates of 1100 and 
1200 a year callahan says it is hard to pay a living wage to 
teachers who have families of their own 
the superintendent also believes catholic leaders have not done 
enough to encourage parents to use the catholic schools today 
you rarely hear anyone talk about the values of catholic schools 
from the pulpit he says so many people have children in 
public schools they dont want to offend anyone 
secretary of education william j bennett told the ncea 
convention in new york last month that catholic schools are closing 
in part because they have failed to make their case to the 
public 
you cant wait around for tax credits or tuition vouchers or 
other forms of new government fundingthey are not imminent 
said bennett a catholic who attended both public and parochial 
schools 
he suggested that catholic schools recruit from public schools 
the worst cases the dropouts the problem discipline cases the 
socalled worst five or 10 percent educate them and then ask 
society for fair recompense 
bennett suggested that local communities or business groups pay 
half the 4500 that public schools now spend per student by 
contrast catholic schools spent about 4 billion in 198586 or 
1072 per elementary pupil and 2025 for high school students 
in an interview bennett said the catholic schools have not 
been aggressive like the evangelical schools i dont know why 
because the catholic church has certainly wanted to be aggressive 
on other issues i think it would do better frankly presenting 
itself as an educator of poor childrenthan as a critic of the 
united states in central america 
bennetts challenge drew a skeptical response from catholic 
school leaders 
the nceas mcnamee called it a very creative idea but 
added i dont think that even bennett would think that it could 
be implemented entirely and literally in all parts of the country 
we do have many of the potential dropouts problem students 
etc in our schools they do very well she said but if we 
went out and recruited we would have to hire additional teachers 
administrators special services remedial courses and equipment 
and so forth now the schools would not be able to survive until 
four or five years from now with the hope that the municipality or 
the state might reimburse for these services 
but she said bennetts idea might be useful as a jumping off 
point for some pilot projects paid for by private industry or 
foundations

public educators generally do not regard catholic schools as 
doing them any favors 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said that even in the inner cities parochial schools 
educate a select group 
they are kids who will sit still who will keep quiet who 
will bring their homework in who will wear a tie or certain type 
of uniform and whose parents are willing to put up a couple of 
hundred bucks even if its a very small amount said shanker 
catholic and other religious schools have been stymied in the 
courts and in congress in their efforts to secure more government 
support three of the past four presidents richard nixon jimmy 
carter and ronald reagan promised wider help none has delivered 
reagan has frequently extolled the idea of tuition tax credits 
but he has been unable to obtain them the administration also 
believes strongly in giving parents wider choice in education but 
lately it has been talking primarily about choice among public 
schools 
the 1965 legislation that provided remedial aid for 
disadvantaged children specifically allowed religious schools to 
take part but a 54 ruling by the supreme court drove the remedial 
classes out of catholic school buildings and into vans or other 
sites off the premises 
minority enrollment in catholic schools has doubled since 1970 
blacks hispanics and other minorities now comprise 22 percent of 
all students sixtyfour percent of the 234300 black pupils are 
not catholic 
studies by james coleman a university of chicago sociologist 
and others have found catholic students outperforming their public 
school counterparts on the national assessment of educational 
progress reading and writing tests the gap between the average 
performance of black and white pupils is narrower than in public 
schools 
coleman in a study on the high school class of 1982 found the 
dropout rate between the sophomore and senior year was 14 percent 
for public school students but only 34 percent for those in 
catholic school 
valerie lee a university of michigan education professor says 
there is an institutional pull toward academic pursuits in 
catholic schools for all students regardless of their ethnic 
social and academic background that we do not see in the public 
schools 
fiftyfour of the 149 students at most precious blood are black 
among them is 13yearold alethia henson a seventh grader all 
the schools i go to close down she said 
this is the third catholic school that has gone under for her 
the rev joseph hughes the third pastor at most precious blood 
in as many years says one reason we hate to see our school 
leave here is that this is our greatest evangelization toolmost 
of the people moving into the community are black so it would be a 
real opportunity to start building but we couldnt possibly afford 
to hang in there long enough to do anything like that 
before becoming a priest hughes was a cost analyst for the 
rouse co as soon as i arrived and started looking at papers i 
realized that oh my goodness this doesnt seem like this is very 
responsible in a parish this size carrying this much of a financial 
burden 
the principal of most precious blood dorothy parker says 
enrollment had dropped from more than 200 four years ago to 149 
this year 
she expects most of her pupils to transfer to st anthony of 
padua school 2 miles away the parishes and parents groups have 
arranged a union st anthony has 416 students now and a capacity 
of 700 its tuition is somewhat higher 
the nine teachers on parkers staff earn from 12000 to 
18000 three are newlyweds without children but some are women 
raising families by themselves 
lynda miller who teaches math and science to the upper grades 
had her application in with baltimore city and county schools even 
before the news came of the closing 
miller said it puts a lot of stress on a person the emotions 
vary it runs from anger youre angry because the hierarchy who 
appears on the outside to care when it comes down to the gut 
level sometimes it seems like they really dont 
miller and her former husband pay 1900 to send their daughter 
to a catholic high school she calls most precious blood a very 
close familytype school where god is brought into their life 
throughout not just in religion class 
but she says ill be honest if i were in the county and 
there was a good public school system id send my kid to public 
school she fears that catholic schools will turn more into 
private private schools where only the rich will be able to afford 
it

editors note with foreign investment at record levels and 
tourists swarming over the countryside the mediterranean nations 
of southern europe are starting to catch up with their 
industrialized neighbors to the north there are some persistent 
problems to be sure but one chief of state predicts the region 
will become the motor of the european community 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after decades of instability and stagnation 
europes southern nations are enjoying a surge of economic growth 
that hints at a potential americanstyle sun belt in the old world 
following world war ii a succession of shaky governments led 
italy while spain portugal greece and turkey were ruled by 
dictatorships or militarybacked governments their economies grew 
by fits and starts 
now for the first time all five countries three of them led 
by englishspeaking economists have governments or coalitions 
likely to lead them into the 1990s growth rates are generally 
higher than the european norm and foreign investment has reached 
record levels 
the center of gravity of europe has moved south says 
portuguese premier anibal cavaco silva whose social democrats won 
a landslide victory in the 1987 elections 
the southern nations will now become the motor of the european 
community 
in the 1980s greece spain and portugal joined the 12nation 
european community marking a more forceful mediterranean presence 
in the trade bloc with turkey knocking on the door for membership 
the european community would like to turn the south of europe 
into a developed area resembling the northern countries says 
antonio la pergola italys sicilianborn harvardeducated 
minister for european community relations this could create a 
sun belt like in the united states in this area 
the brusselsbased community forecasts that the population in 
its southern tier will grow faster than in its northern areas 
industrialization drawing its manpower from the higher birth 
rates may thus trigger economic growth similar to that in the 
united states that led to a migration from the northeast to the 
southeastern sun belt states 
symbolizing the areas new dynamism are spains 
multimilliondollar preparations for the worlds fair in seville in 
1992 and the summer olympics in barcelona the same year 
greece and turkey are cooling their disputes over aegean sea oil 
rights and the mediterranean island of cyprus to focus instead on 
streamlining their oldfashioned economies 
and italy the sick man of europe in the 1970s has become one 
of its economic superstars and now claims to have replaced britain 
as the fifth richest western nation nowadays 76 percent of 
italian households have a car compared with britains 58 percent 
while 81 percent have dishwashers against 77 percent for britain 
but smart cars and flashy clothes are not italys only visible 
signs of prosperity 
italian entrepreneurs were involved in 28 of 68 european mergers 
and takeovers completed over the past two years 
businessmen are anticipating an economic freeforall in 1992 
when common market currency and tariffs finally come down more 
than 320 million europeans will trade goods and services in a 
single market fulfilling the visionary plans of the communitys 
founders when they signed the treaty of rome in 1957 
among them is carlo de benedettti a 53yearold engineer who 
transformed the olivetti typewriter firm into a computer giant and 
is battling for control of the 166yearold societe generale de 
belgique belgiums largest holding company 
giovanni agnelli head of the fiat automakers italys largest 
private company is credited with spearheading italys economic 
revival in the early 1980s holdings controlled by the agnelli 
family range from communications and media properties food 
processing and biotech industries to mutual funds and robot makers 
illustrating newfound confidence in southern europe two leading 
west german banks deutschebank and bayerische vereinsbank last 
year took over italian branches of bankamerica and first national 
bank of chicago respectively 
although italys fiveparty coalition government still plays 
political musical chairs the economy purrs on 
two days after premier giovanni goria resigned on march 11 for 
the third time during his sevenmonth tenure the milan stock 
market recorded its largest gain since the start of the year 
joseph lapalombara a yale university professor argues in his 
book democracy italian style that italys most glaring problem 
political instability is more apparent than real and is in 
fact a positive measure of the countrys heady spirit for survival 
and change 
coming up fast on the west of the mediterranean rim are spain 
and portugal the eecs newest members both recorded 4 percent 
growth rates last year double the eec average contrasted with 
west germanys near zero growth last year 
portugal and spain form the area of greatest economic growth 
in the eec and are the countries that exhibit the best economic 
prospects for the next five years says pedropablo kuczynski a 
peruvian banker with first boston international 
in spain foreign investors last year poured 79 billion into 
the economy twice the 1986 amount to fund one of europes 
fasttrack economies moving toward what the spaniards call el 
horizonte 92 horizon 92 
i see an important new axis from turin to paris to madrid 
bringing the center of europe southward says juan luis cebrian 
the editor of madrids daily el pais 
spain and portugal are coming together in a way we would have 
thought unbelievable only a few years ago he says 
the barcelona olympic games and the seville worlds fair in 1992 
will create new housing hightech communications and rail and 
road networks at an estimated cost of 89 billion 
the streets of madrid are now choked with shiny new cars 
tripleparked auto sales increased by 29 percent last year 
according to the spanish association of automobile makers 
using skilled spanish labor at lower cost than in the united 
states american telephone amp telegraph co is building an advanced 
microchip plant near madrid and at some rchards in spain apple

we lost the industrial revolution but were going to win the 
postindustrial revolution says spanish banker jane sola 
what triggered spains development was the smooth transition 
from general francisco francos 40year dictatorship to the 
probusiness socialist government of prime minister felipe gonzalez 
in neighboring portugal the european communitys poorest 
member another political switch has spurred economic growth prime 
minister anibal cavaco silva has brought stability in the wake of 
16 years of revolvingdoor governments 
many wealthy portuguese who left the country after a 1974 
leftist revolution that toppled a 42year dictatorship have 
returned to dance in fashionable lisbon nightspots and to present 
their daughters at lavish debutante balls 
cavaco silva a 48yearold former economics professor is 
pushing ahead with privatization of dozens of large stateowned 
companies including tobacco banking media and insurance 
interests 
the degree of confidence in portugal is very very high the 
premier says 
the first statecontrolled company to be put on the block as 
part of cavaco silvas privatization program is epsi portugals 
largest producer of polyethylene and polypropylene the italian 
enichem company is at the top of the list of prospective buyers 
cheap labor which compares favorably with costs in asia has 
attracted foreign manufacturers and brought unemployment down to 
66 percent the lowest in the eec after luxembourg 
a 2anhour minimum wage brings in hightech industries like 
texas instruments which recently launched a 43 million expansion 
of an electronics plant at oporto that employs 1000 people 
tourism is also booming with around 10 million foreigners 
vacationing in portugal every year to make the industry a 
1billionayear business 
at the other end of the mediterranean tourism is still greeces 
biggest foreign exchange earner a record 8 million tourists spent 
32 billion last year 
premier andreas papandreous socialist government in a reversal 
of former policy now wants to broaden the countrys economic base 
and attract foreign capital into greek firms through freer 
financial markets 
reforms of the banking system are laying the groundwork for a 
money market that will allow american brokerage houses to buy seats 
on the booming athens stock market 
western european investors taking advantage of new measures 
permitting their profits to be repatriated last year poured more 
than 52 million into the athens exchange last year 
greece is changing at last says john costopoulos president 
of creditbank greeces biggest private bank 
greeks can now apply for home mortgages and bank interest rates 
are high enough to attract private depositors 
overall modernization of the economy is the basic condition 
for our survival and growth says national economy minister 
panayotis roumeliotis who coordinates economic policy 
papandreou and turkish premier turgut ozal have reached a 
nowar agreement and set up a hot line telephone between their 
capitals to defuse tensions between the two nato members 
bankers and businessmen are firmly behind the current 
greekturkish rapprochement 
turkey which in the 17th century camped 300000 men before the 
gates of vienna firing cannons into the city in order to enter 
europe applied to join the common market in april 1987 greece 
says it wont automatically block the application 
turkey the only islamic nation among the five southern european 
countries is making a bid to replace wartorn lebanon as a banking 
center for the middle east 
at the same time its new seaside resorts are luring western 
tourists for bargain vacations more than 3 million foreigners 
spent 2 billion in turkey last year a 60 percent earnings 
increase over 1986 
ozal a former world bank official says that his export drive 
and freemarket policies including the privatization of state 
monopolies brought growth of 7 percent last year that will enable 
turkeys economy to skip a century 
luxuries like whiskey instant coffee and french champagne are 
now snapped up in turkey where the per capita income is half that 
of portugal 
massive investment in energy transport and communications have 
transformed many towns into huge construction sites turkey is now 
planning a third bridge over the bosporus waterway reflecting the 
countrys determination to link itself with western europe 
the eec absorbs more than 40 percent of all turkish exports and 
west germany is home to 14 million turkish workers and their 
families 
but with a 67 percent inflation rate a currency crunch and a 
huge foreign debt turkey still has a long way to go to reach the 
prosperity of the eec countries 
for the other southern european countries the worldwide october 
stock market crash also highlighted persistent problems 
italy is facing wildcat strikes in transport and industry a 12 
percent unemployment rate and a runaway national debt and the 
south of the country still plagued by crime syndicates like the 
mafia lags economically far behind the north 
in greece stagnant exports europes lowest productivity and a 
huge public sector deficit keep growth rates low 
in spain the socialists are troubled by europes highest 
unemployment 21 percent in 1987 and union protesters filled the 
streets of madrid when the government suggested that state and 
private employers not grant wage hikes of more than 5 percent 
in portugal the per capita income of 2500 is only half that 
of spain and premier cavaco silva concedes that people still go 
hungry 
and if the pace of development cant be speeded up in southern 
europe the economic spurt that is ending mediterranean poverty may 
run out of steam in the competitive post1992 market 
unless theres cohesion among the 12 eec nations development 
in the southern regions will be like quicksand says la pergola 
the italian minister cohesion must start at the bottom the 
south through new forms of financial engineering

rome ap here are brief biographies of the leaders of five 
key nations in southern europe 
 
italy christian democratic premier giovanni goria 44 who 
resigned march 11 has been asked by president francesco cossiga to 
remain as caretaker premier until a new leader is chosen 
party leader ciriaco de mita is currently trying to put together 
another fiveparty coalition 
goria a former accountant from the northern city of asti was a 
surprise choice for premier when he took office on aug 1 1987 at 
the head of the shaky coaltalys 47th postwar 
government goria was italys youngest premier ever 
goria previously served as treasury minister and was credited in 
that post with loosening the countrys restrictive foreign exchition that 
was iange 
controls and with helping to bring doubledigit inflation to its 
present level of about 5 percent 
he is married and has two children 
 
spain prime minister felipe gonzalez a 46yearold seville 
labor lawyer took office in december 1982 following a landslide 
victory of his socialist party he had no previous government 
experience but was head of the parliamentary opposition after spain 
returned to democracy in 1977 
gonzalez is married to sch 
 
rome ap world war ii left the nations of southern europe 
bombedout and poor devastated by six years of combat while a few 
neutral countries led by dictators watched from the sidelines 
italy was brought to its knees by the nazi occupation and the 
allied invasion while rightwing dictators kept a tight grip on 
spain and portugal greece was plunged into civil war between 
communists and nationalists moslem turkey was reeling from abrupt 
change wrought by wartime contact with the west 
italy struggled back on track after 21 years of rule by fascist 
dictator benito mussolini with elections in 1946 funds from the 
us marshall plan laid the groundwork for industrialization 
the christian democrats in power through much of the postwar 
period presided over dramatic economic expansion by the 1960s that 
was termed an economic miracle but in the 1970s political 
instability and worker unrest brought economic crisis and fueled 
terrorism led by the leftist red brigades 
in spain the progerman fascist regime of general francisco 
franco won the bitter civil war of 19361939 but watched world war 
ii from neutral sidelines in the 60s and 70s franco backed the 
roman catholic church traditional landowners and industrialists 
but suppressed freemarket business initiatives 
after francos death in 1975 the country quickly blossomed into 
an ebullient democracy under a constitutional monarch king juan 
carlos 
portugal also watched from the sidelines under the dictatorship 
of antonio de oliveira salazar which lasted 42 years until 1974 
the country veered left after a 1974 revolution but stabilized in 
the 1980s under businessminded centrist governments 
greece recovered economically from the devastating 194649 civil 
war thanks to marshall plan funds political instability in the 
1960s after years of rightwing government triggered the 1967 
colonels dictatorship which collapsed after the 1974 invasion of 
cyprus a referendum that year abolished the monarchy and made 
greece a presidential republic the socialist government of the 
1980s has moved gradually toward centrist probusiness policies 
turkey remained a neutral dictatorship for much of world war ii 
then declared war on germany and japan in 1945 the economically 
backward country became a firm ally of the united states as 
american aid helped cut down state capitalism in favor of free 
enterprise and westernization in the 1950s 
a shortlived military takeover in 1960 ushered in a period of 
political and economic problems that led to street violence in the 
1970s by marxist revolutionaries rightwing gray wolves and 
separatist kurds the military took over again in 1980 but a 
prowestern democracy was restored in parliamentary elections held 
in 1983

editors note in june the 500000th steinway piano designed 
by artist wendell castle will be unveiled at a carnegie hall 
concert yamaha steinways main competitor reaches the 500000 
mark every 2 years on its assembly line in japan but at 
steinways plant in new york most things are still done the 
oldfashioned way thats what makes a steinway a steinway 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a boxshaped soundproof room raymond parada 
stands before a piano keyboard pulled from its shining 9foot body 
parada plinks at the keys listening carefully making adjustments 
instinctively 
no music pours from the instrument parada is not a pianist 
instead he turns music boxes into steinways spending 24 hours 
with the inner workings of each piano creating concert grands for 
artists from vladimir horowitz to billy taylor 
the piano must allow an artist to develop his talents it is 
not like an automobile where it works the same for everybody you 
turn the wheel right the automobile goes right explains parada 
who does things the oldfashioned way at steinway amp sons 
in fact everythings done much the same way its been done 
since john engelhard steinway arrived from germany in 1853 and 
switched from cabinetmaking to keyboards the steinway piano is 
still handstrung fussed and fawned over individually numbered 
tuned and retuned by highly skilled specialists like parada 
it still takes one full year to create the steinway concert 
grand the piano by which all others are judged the product of 
more than 100 patented pianomaking techniques 
it remains the choice of the great pianists claudio arrau van 
cliburn vladimir horowitz as it was the choice of ignace 
paderewski and franz liszt a century ago 
its the only piano for me says peter nero i was 13 when 
i started in competition at the brooklyn academy of music 14 when 
i started at juilliard and its been steinway all the way 
in june the 500000th steinway designed by artist wendell 
castle will be unveiled at a carnegie hall concert yamaha its 
top competitor reaches the 500000 mark every 2 years on its 
assembly line in japan 
the steinway doesnt come cheap either the price list runs from 
7500 to 40000 for the 9foot concert grand yamahas least 
expensive piano costs about 2700 while its concert grand prices 
are about the same as steinway 
how has steinway survived 135 years outlasting an assortment of 
competitors while keeping its reputation for quality 
a steinway is a steinway only because we dont cut any 
corners says john steinway 70 one of the last two family 
members still in the pianomaking business we make quality 
nothing but the top quality we can make 
my greatgrandfather started that when he started the firm 135 
years ago i often say were probably thickheaded and stubborn we 
stick to our principles but it works 
the steinway manufacturing process relies on tradition 
offers william garlick an antique piano aficionado now employed as 
steinways national field service manager that tradition has 
carried on although we dont ignore technology 
instead an exacting process which combines the innovative and 
the antiquated is used to create 3400 steinway pianos each year at 
the companys 11acre queens factory 
in one part of the plant a worker handtrims pieces of veneer 
for the pianos outer surface with a 120yearold machine later in 
the process a newly developed machine perfectly shapes its 
soundboard to fit the piano body 
even that is not a productionline concept says bruce 
stevens president of the firm since steinway musical properties 
inc bought it three years ago its letting technology do 
something even better than we could do it before one man still 
handles that job alone 
there are many answers as to what makes a steinway a steinway 
the input of the artists the commitment to quality the genius of 
19thcentury piano meister cf theodore steinway but those 
responses may miss the forest for the trees which provide the 
steinway wood

one of the things done right here is we use only good wood 
says garlick we have people constantly looking throughout the 
world for good wood 
the wood imported mahogany northeast rock maple yellow 
poplar is improved through aging airdried outdoors for up to 18 
months the wood is then kilndried to remove the moisture and run 
through the mill for shaving and rough shaping 
each pianos outer rim is bent in a process which appears more 
likely to splinter wood than shape it for the grand piano it 
involves seven men 19 panels of wood 22 feet long plenty of 
pushing and a winch amazingly the wood doesnt break but bends 
into the shape of a concert grand 
the process is repeated 150 times a year on the machine 
developed in 1880 by cf theodore steinway the familys 
acknowledged piano genius the pieces of wood in the rim are 
individually coated with oldfashioned animal glue 
it sets up very fast very strong and its acoustically 
sound garlick explains 
a soundboard is cut to the specifications of each rim its 
slightly curved and ribs are attached by hand two more steinway 
innovations 
but perhaps the most important function a simple task which 
determines each succeeding step occurs in the steinway foundry 
metal plates shipped in from springfield ohio are punched with 
two holes taken from the original drawings of henry engelhard 
steinway 
known as the reference holes these quarterinch puncture marks 
serve no purpose other than to guide creation of the piano from 
that point forward the soundboard the stringing the placement of 
the keyboard everything revolves around the two marks 
its been the same two holes since day one garlick says 
in the aptly named bodystretching stage an employee climbs 
inside the piano rim and pushes out with his hands and feet before 
the plate and soundboard are fitted the piano action its 
hammers felt and other interior parts are painstakingly pieced 
together and subjected to repeated quality checks 
by the time the piano is assembled wired and shipped to raymond 
paradas department it has gone through 25 to 30 checkpoints the 
workers responsible for bigger jobs like soundboard placement 
piano stringing and tone adjustment often sign their work 
its an aspiration of everybody to be immortal and so like 
an artist signs his painting i sign the piano explains parada 
his voice growing soft i put into the piano the best of myself 
his attitude is pervasive throughout the plant three 
pianostringers working side by side in the factory use three 
different methods to perform their task each convinced his way is 
the right way 
we dont mind that we encourage the little rivalries between 
them because the product comes out good says john steinway who 
began his career running wood from the yard to the factory 
the unique process at the plant means each piano will sound a 
bit different the company allows any perspective buyer be it 
peter nero or peter zero to play several pianos and pick the one 
which sounds best to them 
the future of steinway holds an immediate challenge a frontal 
assault by yamaha on their once nearexclusive concert grand market 
there are some defectors billy joel played a yamaha grand on 
his recent album the bridge and bruce hornsby winner of the 
1987 best new artist grammy doesnt use a steinway 
while yamaha made its first concert grands in 1902 they only 
recently began concentrating on the grand piano market 
i think yamahas doing a very good job these days but its 
still not a steinway says nero who owns four

for more than a century since 1853 the male 
descendants of a german immigrant cabinetmaker followed their 
fathers into the business of making quality pianos 
but the curtain appears to be coming down on that tradition the 
fourth generation of steinways in the business apparently is the 
last 
just two of henry e steinways descendants both of them past 
retirement age remain with the company 
brothers john and henry z steinway are now consultants with 
steinway amp sons providing the final link with the creator of the 
steinway piano their greatgrandfather 
theyre really involved in a special way we value them 
highly says bruce stevens current president of steinway what 
better link do we have with the past and tradition 
the new generation of descendants of henry e steinway chose 
different routes 
none of the kids were interested in coming in says john 
steinway 70 over the constant plinkplinkplink of pianotuning 
outside the office he shares with his brother they all wanted to 
go out and do their own thing 
weve got a banker weve got a computer expert weve got an 
architect weve all kinds of things in the next generation 
john steinway can recall childhood dinner guests like sergei 
rachmaninoff and arthur rubinstein breaking bread at the steinway 
table his father often took the two brothers on weekend day trips 
to the piano factory in queens 
i got brought in with my mothers milk in a way recalls 
john sitting inside manhattans steinway hall an ornate piano 
showcasemuseum i was brought up in it 
walking around steinway hall john is greeted time and time 
again by workers hes known for years 
number 237 thats horowitzs piano steinway says 
pointing to a concert grand one of about a dozen kept in the 
basement for use by visiting performers thats one of his bats 
steinway recalls the day he decided to become a piano man 
in those days a job was a job says john who joined the 
firm in the late 1930s my father said if you want to work with 
the company fine you go out to the factory at 730 in the 
morning and start your apprenticeship which i did 
three years later he began moving up in the company henry z 
became president of the company while john handled marketing and 
production when the inevitable became apparent in 1972 when there 
were no members of the steinway family to move into the business 
the decision was made to sell 
cbs inc purchased steinway amp sons but the corporations 
handling of the family trade struck a bad chord with steinway 
we were not very happy with cbs as part of a large 
corporation steinway says 
the company was sold to steinway musical properties inc in 
1985 
its worked out well steinway says puffing on a cigarette 
and tugging on his suspenders im very happy because i look to 
the future and think its good 
the piano will go on

editors note some people go through life with a sure touch 
for the practicalities of everyday life others flounder for them 
former tv reporter betsy ashton has written a guide designed to 
keep them out of the many traps that open up in a consumer society 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
who among us was raised with an innate knowledge 
of which telephone company gives us the best deal who in fact 
ever dreamed that picking a telephone company would be a way of 
life in 1988 
and if you wouldnt buy a used car from that man whom would 
you buy one from and how do you negotiate with him when youre not 
even really sure what rack and pinion means 
what about the jungle of financial jargon that everyone else 
seems to understand like cds iras deferred annuity bonds 
keoghs municipals etc 
it was simpler when people just went to the bank that gave the 
best toaster if you already had a toaster the next toughest 
choice was whether you wanted the revere ware pots or a nonbrand 
that had pretty yellow flowers on it 
these are things that almost everyone at some point in life 
just starting out after a divorce recently widowed must learn 
to deal with without getting stung in the process 
you arent born with this knowledge kids of people who own 
businessess or are in the financial world might know some of it 
but most of us dont says betsy ashton a former national 
consumer affairs correspondent for television and author of 
betsy ashtons guide to living on your own due in bookstores 
early this summer 
this book is not for people who see an ad on television and 
send 5 away and expect to get a diamond ring in return they 
deserve what they get this book is for reasonably intelligent 
people who must face these kinds of things for the first time and 
arent aware of the pitfalls 
this book is not about the things your mother never told you 
its about the things your father never told you says ms 
ashton like taxes audits how much insurance you need which 
health club to join how to pick a telephone company and how to 
deal with the media if youve gotten yourself into a mess that 
would incidentally make a good story 
a lot of the advice comes from ashtons nearly 17 years in radio 
and television first teaching art on cable tv then covering the 
courts in washington dc and later as the consumer affairs 
expert there and ultimately for cbs 
she often got tips from viewers who had been ripped off by one 
scheme or another as a local reporter she named names and 
products 
thats the job of the local reporter but i dont do that in 
the book she says this is more of a household encyclopedia 
that would be applicable anywhere she explains for instance 
some of the oldest tricks in the books such as the bait and switch 
ruse and how not to go for the bait 
its a practical book the section on health clubs for 
instance warns against paying the annual membership fee to clubs 
that havent opened yet some have gone under before they got 
going others she warns may be on shaky financial ground so 
check them out before handing over your check for a years 
membership 
also figure out what you really need are you paying for fancy 
exercise machines that youre not likely to use or a swimming 
pool when what you really want is the racquet ball court she 
advises going to ymcas or schools to see if you might get the 
facilities you want much cheaper or go to a club that has only 
the facilities you actually intend using it will probably be 
cheaper

she confesses to being a victim herself joining health clubs to 
drop that extra 20 pounds that always crept back on she finally 
calculated that her demanding schedule working long days made it 
impractical her visits turned out to cost her 40 a session 
her book tells you what questions to ask up front and urges the 
timid to push for answers to key questions especially what is 
this going to cost me 
healthy skepticism is important she says a financial 
planner or an accountant should be able to explain things to you 
without talking down to you and telling you to just trust me 
ask him or her about fees about how much of his income is 
derived from commissions ask for references look for possible 
conflicts of interest 
she tells how to find out what the car dealer paid for the car 
he is selling you the tollfree 800 number to call to find out 
whether the model of used car youre considering has ever been 
recalled how to spot cosmetic coverups on a used car 
ashton 43 and recently remarried says her book draws on files 
she had kept as a television consumer expert 
i spent a lot of time on the telephone updating things and 
reinterviewing people but basically it was years and years of 
reporting that went into the book she says 
if youre going to try the media she tells you how first do 
all the work yourself the local reporter or columnist doesnt have 
time to unearth every single aspect of your case they get 
hundreds maybe thousands of letters from irate consumers seeking 
to enlist the newspaper in their cases 
you the abused must document your claim agree to be 
interviewed and if you live in a multimedia town dont ship out 
carbons to every reporter in town pick the one you like best 
offer an exclusive story and hope for the best 
it helps if the story is interesting and has broad appeal 
ashton had an unusual career trail 
she was accepted by the peace corps but fell in love and 
married instead a talented artist whose apartment is decorated 
with ashton originals she worked for an advertising agency taught 
art in high school and decided that if julia child could teach 
french cooking on television she could teach art on there so she 
did 
she did radio interviews around the feminist movement covered 
the courts for a washington tv station and worked as an artist at 
the same time 
you learn that lawyers are very repetitive she says the 
first time they said something i took notes the second time i 
started sketching the jurors and the third time i added the color 
she turned down the job as consumer affairs reporter the first 
time it was offered 
i thought it was going to be all fluff she says i 
thought it was the equivalent of being the weather girl 
the second time it was offered it was explained that it would 
be more of a ralph nader sort of thing we were going after 
companies and individuals that were ripping off the public that i 
liked 
ashton grew up in the suburbs of trenton nj with pretty much 
of a belief in the goodness of her fellow human beings 
i really didnt know there were these kind of people people 
who simply preyed on others as a way of life she says

had a good bandmaster maj endicott smith who had graduated in 
music from the university of heidelberg he taught me german 
harmony anybody interested he would teach them 
hampton had studied armstrongs records so on that october day 
in 1930 he romped through armstrongs trumpet solo in big butter 
and egg man on the vibraphone it knocked louis out hampton 
says 
they recorded eight songs that day on the first one eubie 
blakes memories of you hampton played vibes while armstrong

club hampton became known 
when the engagement ended hampton assembled his first band 
they traveled in four cars and a trailer for his drums and vibes 
from san diego to vancouver bc 
i always played good dance music and played jazz for a show i 
built up a following hampton says i play a lot of dances now 
they always ask me to make return engagements young people dance 
too im just back from a teenage affair in washington there were 
5000 kids there we were supposed to quit at 1030 at 1230 they 
were yelling for more and stomping on the floor 
in the early 1930s hampton traded touring for a job in the 
paradise nightclub across the street from the los angeles train 
station theyd leave the doors open hampton says and sailors 
arriving to paint the town would come in beer was 25 cents a 
pitcher and there was sawdust on the floor 
i had a good band there hampton says benny goodman was 
at the palomar ballroom john hammond was with him naturally john 
would ask where he could hear some good jazz he heard us and he 
brought benny down lo and behold im on the bandstand playing and 
i hear a guy playing clarinet beside me i could tell it was 
bennys famous clarinet it was aug 19 1936 ill never forget 
we played like that about two hours straight people were calling 
people and they were coming from all over town that place was 
packed and jammed we was blowing 
benny asked me to come the next morning to a recording date i 
went and we did moonglow and dinah those records got so 
popular benny kept calling me to come to new york we thought he 
was kidding 
the paradise took the sawdust off the floor and put 
tablecloths on the tables it was 125 to come in after that jam 
session you couldnt get in even with the price of admission we 
got superfamous overnight because benny had come and christened 
us 
on nov 11 1936 hampton joined the benny goodman quartet at 
the pennsylvania hotel in new york city 
everything was segregated then black and white he says 
that night the barrier broke youve got to give benny credit 
hampton says that black pianist teddy wilson had played 
intermission music for goodman band concerts and played with 
goodman and drummer gene krupa as the benny goodman trio on 
records but never live until that nov 11 when the trio became a 
quartet 
i had four gorgeous years with benny hampton says then 
benny had back trouble and his doctor told him to rest awhile he 
got me a contract at rca and i started making allstar records

on her 17th birthday last fall linzi hateley 
got a plum of a present the title role in carrie the new 
broadway musical about a girl with telekinetic powers 
at the time miss hateley was a student at the italia conti 
academy a drama school in london her acting credentials were 
meager a british touring company of annie and a small part on 
a television series 
but the next day she was the cinderella story in the london 
tabloids unknown lands lead in major show coproduced by the 
prestigious royal shakespeare company 
it didnt sink in at all until i settled down and started 
rehearsing miss hateley says now it has been a turbulent and 
fastpaced few months 
carrie is based on the stephen king novel that most people 
remember as a movie with sissy spacek playing the troubled 
teenager in the film carrie is taunted and tormented by other 
high school students and her mother before she gets revenge on prom 
night 
i was told right from the beginning not to try and base myself 
on sissy spacek miss hateley recalls the musical tries to 
follow the book rather than the film because the show really is 
more of a tragedy than a horror story 
carrie is a unique collaboration of american and british 
theater people with the blessing of actors unions in both 
countries the show has a joint angloamerican cast 
the director is terry hands artistic head of the royal 
shakespeare company the music and lyrics were written by michael 
gore and dean pitchford the men who wrote fame debbie allen 
broadways recent sweet charity did the choreography 
the show was to costar barbara cook as carries bizarre and 
vindictive mother but miss cook dissatisfied with her role left 
after the shows engagement in stratford england the home base of 
the royal shakespeare company 
barbara was so nice miss hateley says shes so motherly 
and was always lovely to me i think she didnt want to be nasty 
which is what the part requires 
betty buckley who played the gym teacher in the movie version 
of carrie has now taken over the role of the mother 
she came in and said lets get into this miss hateley 
says the score hasnt really changed a lot since then just the 
way that it is being done has its becoming a little weirder now 
before it was very melodic now its stranger 
miss hateley is from a small town near birmingham in central 
england her father is a toolmaker and her mother a secretary 
neither had any theatrical aspirations their daughter the second 
of two children did 
when i was very young i had a lot of energy miss hateley 
saysi was always a real pain until i started dancing and got rid 
of some of that energy 
she was sent to the local dancing school and got jobs in 
community productions at the age of 14 she was accepted by the 
italia conti in london and her parents took out loans to pay the 
expensive tuition 
im paying them back now out of my salary miss hateley 
says they did so much for me 
while at the school she auditioned for carrie singing on 
my own from les miserables after a second audition she got 
the job 
her parents came to see the musical in stratford and were 
surprised at her performance 
they knew that i sang well and obviously they were very 
confident in me or they wouldnt have let me go to the theater 
school in the first place miss hateley says but more than 
anything they were shocked with the acting i was doing they had 
never really seen me act 
the young actress worked closely with hands best known on 
broadway as the man who staged the rsc productions of much ado 
about nothing and cyrano de bergerac with derek jacobi and 
sinead cusack 
it wasnt until the show moved to new york and started to 
rehearse again that miss hateley began to understand her character 
ive just suddenly come to realize that the whole thing about 
carrie is that she really is quite an intelligent person miss 
hateley says she doesnt have to be ugly and she doesnt have to 
be awkward she can be quite beautiful in her own way shes just 
different 
when miss hateley first started doing the role she wondered how 
she could keep up the intense pace required by it now she is 
getting used to it 
i take everything as it comes and even if the show isnt a 
success its still a great achievement for me and a great 
experience miss hateley says i listen to everybodys advice 
im not saying that i always take it but if i listen to it all 
then i can make my own decisions im learning so much and so 
quickly i have to

on may 13 1888 princess isabel of 
brazil signed the golden law and 780000 slaves went free three 
centuries after blacks first came in bondage from africa 
a hundred years later the brazilian government is commemorating 
the event with tributes to what it calls racial democracy 
blacks however maintain that widespread prejudice and 
inequality leave them little to celebrate 
president jose sarney has designated may 13 a national holiday 
the government the media and the roman catholic church have begun 
nationwide campaigns aimed at portraying brazils multiracial 
society as integrated 
but while millions of brazilian blacks and whites live and work 
side by side in apparent harmony many here contend that racial 
democracy is a myth 
abolition of slavery here was merely a legal act it has meant 
little in reality said arnaldo beltrami spokesman for the 
brazilian bishops council which in the worlds largest catholic 
nation is given great importance 
the golden law already approved by the national legislature 
was signed by princess isabel while her father emperor dom pedro 
ii was out of the country the 780000 slaves joined millions of 
other blacks already released from bondage and they were left to 
fend for themselves without education training or jobs 
it happened 25 years and 134 days after abraham lincolns 
emancipation proclamation in the united states 
as the slavery issue helped set off the civil war in the united 
states abolition in brazil without compensation to slave owners 
was a factor in the ouster of dom pedros monarchy and the 
establishment of brazil as an republic 
today blacks and mulattoes make up about 80 million of brazils 
143 million people they are prominent in sports and entertainment 
among them the soccer great pele singercomposer milton 
nascimento and actorvaudevillean grande othello 
but political leaders army generals corporate executives 
diplomats and bishops are almost exclusively the descendants of 
white portuguese colonizers or other white european immigrants 
the 559seat national congress has just seven black members 
helpwanted ads still specify that applicants should have a 
good appearance meaning they should be white 
blacks are unwelcome in many restaurants bars and upperclass 
apartment buildings where doormen sometimes force them to use the 
service entrance 
blacks here are found in hillside shantytowns working as 
maids or as manual laborers in prisons and in juvenile delinquency 
centers said benedita da silva brazils first black 
congresswoman and a former maid 
to the casual observer brazil is an astonishing blend of racial 
types 
centuries of racial mixing starting with the portuguese native 
indians and then african slaves have produced a range of skin hues 
and hair types that the countrys portuguese language defines in 
120 different ways 
much of brazilian culture also comes from black africa 
including samba music many typical national dishes such as 
feijoada black bean stew cachaca sugar cane liquor and 
popular voodootype spirit religions 
president sarney in announcing the may 13 holiday spoke of a 
mixedrace people living and growing in harmony he held up 
brazil as a model for nations like south africa 
tv globo the countrys largest private television network for 
several months has been broadcasting a public service announcement 
with wellknown black performers and athletes wishing viewers 
axe pronounced ahsheh an african word meaning good luck 
and power 
another tv message sponsored by the roman catholic archdiocese 
of rio de janeiro shows a black hand and a white hand slowly 
clasping while a voice says many races one people 
the governmentcontrolled bank of brazil is paying for a similar 
media campaign 
but racial prejudice still runs deep 
paulo de jesus 18 lives with his father and four brothers and 
sisters in a crumbling portuguese colonialera house in salvador a 
city of 18 million about 1120 miles northeast of rio de janeiro 
salvador was brazils capital in the 17th century and as the 
principal slave port became a center of black culture 
paulo de jesus said he does not feel discriminated against but 
he added that he often is stopped searched and asked for 
identification by police officers twice he has been arrested on 
suspicion he said

in a recent independent survey 309 brazilian youngsters 7 to 18 
years old were asked to look at photographs of a white and a black 
person and to link certain characteristics to each the survey 
indicated that 829 percent of the children considered the black 
man stupid 857 percent found him ugly and 842 percent 
saw him as a thief in comparison the percentages 
respectively for the white were 171 143 and 158 
in rio de janeiro a black businesswoman married to a white 
swiss citizen told the newspaper jornal do brasil that when she 
tried to pay for dinner by check at a fashionable nightclub the 
management refused to accept it apparently in the belief the 
checkbook was stolen 
they insulted me and threw me out elisabeth da silva 
zobrist told the paper i called the police and ended up with the 
manager at the precinct station they accepted my check only after 
the police chief called up my house and confirmed i was who i said 
i was 
blacks also lag behind whites in education and income 
a government census showed blacks on average complete just 21 
years of schooling compared to 48 years for whites and blacks 
earn 47 percent less than whites doing the same work according to 
a 1985 labor union study 
blacks have never been integrated into brazilian society as 
full citizens said the black composer and singer gilberto gil 
who also is the bahia state secretary of culture 
we need to think about what princess isabels signature on a 
piece of paper actually meant for us if anything gil added in 
an interview in his office in salvador bahias capital 
starting in the 1500s brazil brought in an estimated 36 
million west africans to work on sugar cotton and coffee 
plantations and to mine gold and diamonds 
the abolitionist movement grew after 1850 when the government 
outlawed slave trading in 1871 the free womb law declared that 
children born of slave mothers would be considered free 
when brazil finally abolished slavery it was the last country 
in the western hemisphere to do so and under sharp international 
censure 
the emancipation actually took the wind out of a growing 
abolitionist movement maybe our lives would be different if the 
law had not been signed just then said the black historian and 
activist joao jorge rodrigues he suggested brazil could have taken 
more time to prepare blacks for citizenship 
but the documentary history of slavery in brazil was virtually 
erased in 1891 when finance minister ruy barbosa had the records of 
slave trade burned on grounds that the country should look ahead 
and forget its african past 
possibly because of that black consciousness today is dim and 
black pride almost nonexistent few black rights groups or 
activists exist many mixedrace brazilians seek to appear whiter 
and climb the social ladder 
there is no such thing as black here said januario 
garcia head of the institute for research on black culture in rio 
de janeiro people use any word but black to define themselves 
they want to be as white as possible 
still in this centennial year awareness of discrimination is 
growing 
at rio de janeiros famous prelenten carnival parades this past 
february many of the poor mostly black groups competing for 
prizes with floats and samba music chose racism as their themes 
rather than the usual folklore motifs 
the champion group vila isabel offered a tribute to zumbi 
leader of a 17th century slave revolt and a hideaway for runaway 
slaves the runnerup was the mangueira school which sang of blacks 
free from the masters whip but trapped in the slums 
many black groups said they dont intend to celebrate the may 13 
holiday but planned festivities for nov 20 
that is the anniversary of the death of zumbi killed in 1695 by 
portuguese troops who defended slave owners 
we need to celebrate black strength not a gift from white 
men garcia said

the severed heads of a school principal 
and a journalist were left hanging in plastic bags in a town square 
set among lovely wooded hills their foreheads were smeared with 
vermilion a gurkha mark of revenge 
the killings in april were among the most brutal in the twoyear 
campaign by gurkhas famed as soldiers in the british and indian 
armies for the creation of a separate indian state called 
gurkhaland around this oncetranquil vacation retreat 
subash ghising 52yearold leader of the gurkha agitation has 
been negotiating with indian government officials but in an 
interview with the associated press he seemed in no mood to 
compromise 
we want blood for blood an eye for an eye and we will settle 
for nothing less than a homeland for the gurkhas he said at his 
wellguarded headquarters in darjeeling which also is famous for 
its tea 
so far ghisings repeated trips to new delhi have swayed indian 
officials to offer the gurkha area some governmental power and 
development funds but not to make it indias 26th state 
the killing goes on with at least 275 deaths recorded since the 
agitation started in april 1986 
some officials of west bengal state which now governs the area 
say privately the dispute has the potential to lead to more 
dangerous demands for a separate country as militant sikhs have 
done in punjab state 
the gurkhas who are indians of nepalese descent want 2250 
square miles around darjeeling an area slightly larger than 
delaware as a gurkha state within india they say their hilly 
homeland is different from the flatlands around the west bengals 
capital calcutta and that they are ethnically distinct from the 
bengalis 
the gurkhas say about 14 million gurkha people live around 
darjeeling and 46 million live elsewhere in india they first came 
here in the 1850s to make their way as soldiers or as workers on 
tea plantations 
ghising a former army corporal teacher and bantamweight boxer 
says government force can only aggravate the problem 
by provoking us by killing or wounding our men the 
government is creating wounded tigers he said you know what a 
wounded tiger does it hunts for men and devours them 
nowadays only police officers are seen at night outside the 
quaint old houses built by the british who developed darjeeling as 
a hill station 
fears have worsened since april 6 when school principal dileswar 
rais severed head was found in kalimpong 43 miles east of 
darjeeling he had kept his school open during a general strike 
called by gurkha militants 
the severed head of nirmal rai a reporter for a local 
newspaper was found at the same place april 12 the journalist 
who was not related to the principal was accused of being a police 
informer 
the governments response to the violence has been building up a 
force of more than 4000 security forces and paramilitary police 
who often open fire with mortars and machine guns 
we are fighting a very well entrenched enemy and the terrain 
is in their favor said raj kanojia a police superintendent in 
charge of antiinsurgency operations 
amid the violence the tea and tourist trades are suffering a 
backlash by marxistcontrolled unions has forced 30000 gurkha 
laborers to flee from tea estates to refugee camps in darjeeling 
and the adjoining state of sikkim 
gurkha insurgents have felled at least 2000 pine trees to block 
roads more than 600 homes have been burned by insurgents or 
marxists who support the calcutta government 
more than 250 government buildings have been set ablaze 
including two stations of the toy train built in 1879 by the 
british and so called for its tiny cars and narrowgauge track 
the gurkha campaign also has triggered fears for the security of 
the seven strategically important northeastern states near china 
with whom india has a longstanding border dispute 
the northeast an area about the size of colorado is connected 
to the main part of india by a narrow land corridor called the 
siliguri neck in the envisoned gurkhaland 
ghising the gurkha leader now brushed aside the question of 
secession 
we are indians and we will remain indians he said 
but ghising who also is the author of more than 20 racy 
potboiler novels in the nepali language made it clear he is not 
going to give in without achieving his goals 
he sits in an office guarded by toughlooking gurkas with their 
traditonal curved 14inch kukri knives behind him is a green 
gurkhaland flag emblazoned with a kukri and three stars 
he reeled off his demands 
recognition of nepali as an official indian language 
more government jobs for gurkhas 
better education and more industry 
if we do not get statehood for gurkhaland the indian 
government will regret it he added they have seen only a 
flash of gurkha retaliation gurkha courage gurkha dedication but 
if we are pushed we will start a full scale nonstop 
retaliation 
about 48000 retired gurkha soldiers live in darjeeling and 
indian officials fear they could join ghisings campaign 
above the town a giant graffiti painted on a mountain slope 
shows blood dripping from a kukri knife 
below it reads welcome to gurkhaland

the killing goes on as it has for six 
years and the prospects for peace talks have grown slimmer in the 
war waged by sikh militants for an autonomous homeland in the 
indian state of punjab 
in an apparent move to open peace talks prime minister rajiv 
gandhi freed a radical sikh priest from jail but then he said he 
would talk only within the framework of the indian constitution 
the militants responded that they will not negotiate until the 
government accepts their demand for the independent sikh nation of 
khalistan a concept that is very much outside the consititution 
we will continue tofight in the same manner until we get 
khalistan said jagir singh spokesman for the panthic committee 
an underground umbrella grouping of militant sikh groups 
it is not a demand he said in an interview it is our 
right 
sikhs make up 2 percent of indias 800 million people but are a 
majority in punjab sikh militants claim they are being subjugated 
by hindus who form 80 percent of the population 
the sikh agitation has claimed at least 735 lives this year and 
the violence has worsened recently 
more than 350 people have been killed in the six weeks since 
gandhi freed the radical sikh priest jasbir singh rode from jail 
the killings blamed on sikh militias have raised fears that the 
government would turn a harsher face toward punjab at the same 
time the priest was freed gandhi pushed through parliament a bill 
that would allow the government to clamp emergency rule on punjab 
severely limiting individual rights 
jagir singh was asked in the interview if he expected a 
government move to drive out the radicals who have taken refuge in 
the golden temple the sikh holy place in amitsar 
we are ready for an attack he said 
he characterized the militants attitude with a punjabi proverb 
a brick will be replied to with a stone 
indian officials seek to play down the possibility of a raid on 
the temple an army raid in 1984 left more than 1200 people dead 
most of them sikhs and the desecration of the shrine angered the 
entire sikh community five months later prime minister indira 
gandhi rajiv gandhis mother was assassinated by sikh bodyguards 
in an act of revenge 
police officers in amritsar see little hope that conciliatory 
moves by the government would end the violence 
these people kill nearly 10 people every day said izhar 
alam amritsar district police superintendent we must take 
strong action 
he added this should include sending security forces into the 
golden temple where about 100 armed militants are believed to have 
taken shelter 
alam also said police alone could not raid the temple complex 
other forces will have to be included he said the 
militants have ak47 automatic rifles and carbines all we the 
police have is 303 rifles and pistols 
the biggest impediment to any plan to raid the militants 
sanctuary is a threat held out by rode the freed priest 
if the government enters the temple they will be laying the 
foundation for khalistan rode said 
he spoke at a meeting april 13 of about 40000 sikhs in south 
punjab it was his first major appearance since his release and 
there were reports he would encourage moderation among the 
militants and that a peaceful approach would come from the meeting 
but most speakers urged more agitation while rode did not 
directly support moves for khalistan he called for continuing a 
movement to free sikhs from the bonds of slavery 
his demands are the same as ours jagir singh said a day 
later 
rode named to the most influential sikh religious post shortly 
after his release denies entering into any deals with authorities 
he says the only way for a solution is for the government to talk 
directly to the sikh militants 
even moderate sikhs believe the government should make the first 
move for peace such as freeing hundreds of sikh youths jailed as 
suspected militants 
devinder singh a farmer at the mass meeting of sikhs said the 
government first has to prove it wants a settlement 
people in punjab distrust the government he said we have 
been let down too many times let them offer something first

makeshift buddhist pagodas dot the 
jungle across the border from here in bangladesh but the rumble of 
military vehicles and sometimes bursts of gunfire shatter the 
tranquil setting reminders that a littleknown bush war that began 
11 years ago still rages 
the hymns of monks are silenced as terror flashes through the 
refugee camps filled with chakma tribespeople on this side of the 
border 
the chakmas descendants of the warlike mongols who once surged 
across asia are fighting the bangladesh government to hold onto 
their land their buddhist religion and their ageold customs 
against an influx of moslem settlers 
chakma guerrilla leaders say at least 4000 people have died in 
the cycle of killings and bloody reprisals since the chakmas took 
up arms in may 1977 and killed 40 bangladesh policemen in their 
first ambush 
the battle is vicious unequal unremitting and rarely reported 
bangladesh seldom allows foreign reporters to visit the chakmas 
ancestral homeland in the chittagong hill tracts 
india does not permit foreign journalists to travel to its 
border states housing the refugees but indian reporters can make 
the trip with police permission 
the chittagong hill tracts which roll over 5138 square miles 
in southern bangladesh border burma and the northeastern indian 
states of tripura and mizoram 
belonia hills is the region in indias tripura state that faces 
the chittagong hill tracts 
in camouflage uniforms of war bangladeshi soldiers move from 
village to village in the deep woods and jungles of the hill 
tracts often firing at random to frighten away the chakmas 
sometimes to kill them said bakul chakma a refugee at the 
takumbari camp 10 miles from the border 
the battle often fought at midnight on jungle paths traveled by 
elephants and reptiles pits 20000 bangladeshi soldiers and 40000 
paramilitary troops and policemen against 4000 guerrillas 
in the past two years more than 50000 tribespeople have fled 
to indias tripura state to avoid the fighting 
we tried enough persuasion when nothing worked we took up 
arms said priti kumar chakma a leader of the tribespeoples 
shanti bahini or army for peace 
what option do we have other than killing those who want to 
finish us the 41yearold guerrilla said in an interview 
arranged on condition the location not be disclosed 
in 1987 amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization said it had received increasing reports of 
arbitrary arrests torture and extrajudicial executions of 
tribespeople in the chittagong hill tracts by bangladeshi troops 
president hussain muhammad ershads government in bangladesh has 
denied the allegations it says it wants to develop the area and 
has pledged the local currency equivalent of 90 million to help 
tribesmen come down from the hills and join mainstream society 
islam is the official religion of bangladesh and about 80 
percent of its 105 million people are moslems the remainder are 
hindus buddhists and christians 
ershads government in dhaka about 200 miles northwest of the 
hill tracts says it is absurd for the chakmas to demand 11 percent 
of the land in bangladesh when they make up less than 05 percent 
percent of the population 
bangladesh is one of the worlds most densely populated nations 
most of the 600000 tribespeople in the chittagong hill tracts 
are chakmas the others are mogs and tripuraies 
so far about 300000 moslems have settled in the area and 
thousands of chakmas have been evicted from their homes in the deep 
woods and moved to what the dhaka government calls ideal 
villages 
the socalled ideal villages are nothing but concentration 
camps charged bimal larma a chakma guerrilla 
in addition to land the chakmas are demanding autonomy but 
this has been rejected by the government 
the tribespeople who speak a mixture of tibetanburmese 
dialects fear they will become a minority in the hills where they 
have lived for centuries 
their political wing the united peoples party charges that 
some tribespeople have been forcibly converted to islam and that 
moslem settlers are encouraged to marry buddhist girls 
we have no similarities at all with the moslems said 
refugee ranjit narayan we love pork they despise it we worship 
buddha they follow islam unless forced we do not kill but they 
kill us at the slightest provocation narayan 54 fled to india 
in 1986 with his wife four sons and a daughter 
i have seen my neighboring villages being burned women raped 
and men killed i told my wife we cant stay here anymore let us 
go he said 
they walked four days to reach takumbari the largest of seven

once upon a time in hollywood the womans picture held sway 
american women flocked to matinees and sobbed and sympathized with 
the plight of such stars as joan crawford bette davis norma 
shearer and greta garbo 
no more movie matinees are largely populated by small fry and 
weary shoppers in malls 
zelly and me arrives a few decades late it is patently a 
womans picture the writerdirector coproducer and leading 
performers are women 
however despite the best performance yet by isabella 
rossellini the film cannot escape a pervading preciousness and 
its chances of finding a wide audience of both sexes seem slender 
indeed 
the zelly of the title is mademoiselle rossellini the 
european nanny whose life is devoted to her young charge the 
orphaned phoebe alexandra jones they live in a mansion presided 
over by phoebes autocratic grandmother coco glynis johns 
zelly and phoebe occupy a fantasy world of stuffed animals all 
with special names and identities and they share a devotion to the 
legend of joan of arc filmgoers will recall that miss rossellinis 
mother ingrid bergman portrayed joan of arc on the screen 
for reasons that arent quite clear coco punishes the child for 
faultless infractions the punishments become more severe even 
sadistic phoebe whose parents were killed in a fiery plane crash 
burns herself in retaliation 
the nanny helplessly watches phoebes torment finding solace 
only in dayoff meetings with the neighbor in another mansion 
david lynch when zelly is fired by the enraged grandmother the 
pair dream up a scheme to spirit away phoebe the conclusion brings 
happiness to no one 
zelly and me is the first feature film by tina rathborne 
and it appears at least partly autobiographical her attention to 
the details of girlhood becomes almost unbearably cloying and only 
in the latter portions does the film gain any momentum 
within the confines of a largely ineffectual role rossellini 
performs with an inner radiance hauntingly like her mothers 
johns absent too long from the screen is effective in a seemingly 
unrewarding role alexandra jones is a gifted young actress fully 
capable of occupying the screen by herself 
david lynch director of blue velvet makes his acting debut 
as the neighbor who is not what he seems he seems stiff in the 
role needful of the direction of say david lynch 
the columbia pictures release was produced by sue jett and tony 
mark the rating is pg small children might be frightened by the 
girls punishment running time 87 minutes

new york at the start of weeds lee umstetter doing a 
life sentence for armed robbery attempts suicide twice once by 
leaping from his cell block at san quentin and once by a crude 
attempt at hanging himself 
depressed are you asks his cell mate 
well i needed a little vacation replies the droll lee 
played by nick nolte 
thats about as deep as the explanations get in weeds a 
flat humorless film based on a play by a reallife excon who 
like umstetter was confined to the california state penitentiary 
in the film umstetter decides to channel his rage and 
frustration into creativity with only a 6th grade education he 
reads dostoevski tolstoy nietszche and genet 
borrowing a bit too liberally from his readings he writes a 
play about prison life called weeds its produced in san 
quentin and unaccountably there happens to be a rich beautiful 
critic in the audience named lillian binghamton equally 
unaccountably eyes meet and presto its amore 
lillian played by rita taggart writes a rave review and 
campaigns successfully to free her newfound love from prison 
it turns out though she isnt much of a critic since she 
failed to perceive that the play is largely plagiarized 
later in the movie she catches umstetter in bed with a younger 
woman theres a touch of chagrin from this person who has freed 
her lover from a life in prison but in a moment or so its 
forgotten 
lillian in short is incredibly dimwitted 
the movie winds on episodically with umstetter forming a 
traveling acting troupe made up of his old jail buddies they take 
it on the road finally making it to new york where the new york 
times drama critic takes the wind temporarily out of their sails 
but by this time the play is not the counterfeit it started out 
to be its so real in fact that they produce it in a prison and 
cause a riot 
presto instant headlines and fame and the bright lights of 
broadway 
sure right 
weeds is rated r for strong prison language and some 
nudity

house of games hbo video vhsbeta 8999 rated r 
 
house of games is set in the seedy underworld of con 
artists and the movie is deliberately something of a con 
itself 
pulitzer prizewinning playwright david mamet who wrote and 
directed this 1980s film noir repeatedly confounds the viewer by 
staging increasingly elaborate confidence games its often 
difficult to be sure whos conning whom and thats what makes the 
movie such creepy fun 
lindsay crouse plays dr margaret ford a psychiatrist who has 
just made a lot of money writing a book but who is clearly unhappy 
maybe even clinically depressed on an impulse she decides to help 
a patient who is a compulsive gambler and visits the house of games 
where she encounters mike the ringleader of the con artists 
played by joe mantegna 
she is strongly attracted to mike and also to the excitement of 
his dangerous profession in a series of plot twists she moves from 
victim to accomplice to aggressor drawn ever deeper into a web of 
deceit that seems certain eventually to destroy her 
crouse who is married to mamet is fascinating in a role 
tailormade for her while mantegna has just the right oily charm 
for his part 
all in all house of games is an original diverting film 
and well worth a look for those who missed it in theaters last year

hairspray mca various artists 
dirty dancing rca various artists 
more dirty dancing rca various artists 
 
do you love me by the contours is one of peaks of rock n 
roll matching depth of anxiety to banality of lyric in the finest 
tradition of the clearasil generation you broke my heart cause 
i couldnt dance ah what a world of pain recalled 
then theres that trick fade before the contours come booming 
back work work in an ecstatic finale 
great as it is do you love me doesnt rescue the dirty 
dancing soundtrack albums from the contempt of all prudent 
consumers rca has spread this collection on two compact discs 
giving as little as 35 minutes of retread listening in a format 
that would hold twice as much so theyre charging 25 or more for 
what is essentially a 2 record in the oldies bin 
the real sin though is the mixture of old and new oldies as 
john waters says are the only known remedy to todays hit parade 
of hell 
the soundtrack collection from waters first mainstream film 
hairspray is the better buy the title track despite its 
satirical intent is absolutely faithful to the old sound 
but again the exasperated consumer wonders why no instructions 
for dancing the madison along with the madison time by the ray 
bryant combo 
through such indifference the old tribal wisdom is in danger of 
being lost

naked sire talking heads 
 
too often on naked its impossible even to guess what the 
talking heads are talking about david byrnes oblique lyrics are 
frustrating because there are snatches of wonderful imagery that 
leave the listener begging for more details 
byrnes eccentricity probably isnt the only reason its hard to 
find a plot in naked the talking heads recorded the basic 
tracks before byrne began to work on the tune or words reducing 
his flexibility as a composer 
but while the records melodies and lyrics are less than fluid 
rhythmically naked is a marvel so lively it would make even 
tipper gore want to dance 
the talking heads brought in studio musicians to create a denser 
sound than on their last two records as a result instruments dart 
in and out of the arrangements almost always serving to enhance 
the syncopation the band and its coproducer steve lillywhite 
achieved a full but remarkably clean sound 
most momentous is the satirical nothing but flowers in 
which byrne provides a fresh perspective on urban sprawl by 
describing with mock horror a place where highways and cars were 
sacrificed for agriculture 
mr jones and totally nude are also made for the dance 
floor while the best of the slower songs is the darkly melodic 
bill about a fat man a little girl and a gun what happens 
we dont know the song like too much of naked is clothed in 
ambiguity

bruce willis a favorite whipping boy of 
the scandal tabloids doesnt think hes that bad 
when ive been talking to people about this film sunset i 
find them so surprised to see that im this calm and that im not 
throwing chairs and swinging from the rafters he said theyre 
pretty surprised that i can be this relaxed 
indeed he was relaxed as he lounged beside the swimming pool on 
a sunswept morning at the beachfront home he shares with his wife 
actress demi moore 
after three frantic years of doing tvs moonlighting and 
three feature movies willis is unaccustomed to the leisure that 
has been enforced by the screenwriters strike like most 
television series moonlighting has shut down for lack of 
scripts 
the actor wore only swim trunks and a cap marked newark rational 
company a small firm that will some day package my films the 
name is an homage to my beginnings in the garden state new 
jersey he looked trim healthy and relaxed 
willis has been doing interviews for sunset blake edwards 
hollywood period piece in which tom mix willis and wyatt earp 
james garner pursue a murder scandal willis interviews have been 
rare in recent times 
my wife has helped me in dealing with the matter of 
publicity he said it just sells more magazines to say im the 
bad boy of hollywood than to say that im not doing anything this 
week or im not throwing any wild parties 
by and large the basic principle was that if you put my 
picture on the cover of a magazine people were going to buy it i 
sell magazines i had to realize that if you took all those people 
out of that industry next week a whole new crowd would come in 
because somebodys got to do that job 
becoming a husband and future father appears to have had a 
salutary influence on willis also the stimulus of working with 
veterans edwards and garner in a topflight production 
the work i had done in television was basically a 
twocharacter show he said the film blind date was 
basically a twocharacter love story i had wanted to work in an 
ensemble situation with a large cast the feel on sunset was the 
closest ive come to working on stage since ive come out here 
i came on the film three weeks late because i was finishing 
up the season on moonlighting when i arrived everyone else had 
been working on their characters and were into that genre jim 
especially made it very comfortable for me we hit it off right 
away and i had never met him before 
theres further evidence of willis domestication he is into 
gardening 
im having a lot of trouble with snails he complained as he 
proudly displayed a tiny bed of marigolds and snapdragons his 
interest in gardening he explained harks back to his new jersey 
childhood 
everyone associates new jersey with going on the turnpike 
through elizabeth newark and that area he said where i grew 
up in south jersey carneys point its very beautiful 
i really grew up out of doors the majority of my first 1617 
years were outside which i really didnt appreciate then as a kid 
i always wanted to live in a larger city now that im older those 
are the memories i have climbing trees and being in the woods 
willis 33 spent a few years at montclair state college where 
he studied drama under jerry lockwood in 1977 he moved to new 
york and began a life of hunting work as an actor and tending bar 
i still remember when 20 was a lot of money he reminisced 
i could eat for three or four days on 20 of course my diet in 
those days was pretty much pizza and beer in some some ways things 
were a lot simpler then there was only one thing to do get a job 
then i didnt have to think about anything else as long as the 
show ran 
once i had a structured job for six months i fell in love 
with a girl and she needed more security in our relationship i 
was anything but financially secure so i took a job managing a 
health club and became the director the relationship fell apart 
and i went back to hunting for acting jobs 
his luck began to change when he starred in sam shepards fool 
for love when he was passed over for a role in desperately 
seeking susan willis took a trip to hollywood and soon was 
tapped for moonlighting 
the abc series costarring cybill shepherd and willis as an odd 
couple of private eyes had a sensational two years it recently has 
been lambasted by critics and fans for constant reruns 
i think we went through a rough time willis said cybill 
was off the show having her babies we really missed having her 
there she brings a lot to the show not having her was like 
watching the three stooges with only one stooge 
he still enjoys doing the show he said 
ill stay as long as it remains creative the medium of 
television itself has worn pretty thin for me abc has been very 
generous with expenses but there are only so many shots you can 
do so many ways to approach a scene after my experiences in film 
i find myself leaning more towards that

the singing of whales the howl of wolves 
and the trilling of a grand canyon wren filled the 800yearold 
christ church cathedral in the university city of oxford 
it was a new kind of music for the venerable norman building 
within the walls of christ church college 
when the six casually dressed american musicians recently 
emulated the sounds of the wild on drums and tambourine the 
audience was so intrigued they got up from their seats to look over 
the choir rails 
from among the medieval tombs came music that celebrates the 
environment as band leader paul winter described it 
winter who lives in litchfield conn and new york calls the 
animals and birds whose sounds he incorporates in his groups 
compositions our members at large 
the paul winter consort combines classical jazz and folk 
instruments drawn from the european and african roots of american 
culture the result is daring fascinating and never dull 
i have never heard anything which was so unexpected and so 
charming at the same time said jane howard an oxford teacher 
who wandered into the concert without being invited 
the group played in the cathedral for participants from 60 
countries at a conference of religious leaders and legislators 
discussing how they can use their influence to help solve problems 
of the planet from the threat of nuclear war to pollution and 
poverty 
i can feel his music its not just something to listen to 
said marian head a business consultant from boulder colo who 
was helping to run the conference 
the twohour concert ended with winter putting out the lights 
and inviting the audience to howl like the wolves they did 
it breaks the ice he said with a smile 
winter and his group are artistsinresidence at the cathedral 
of st john the divine in new york city whose dean james parks 
morton was cochairman of the conference and invited the group to 
oxford paul halley the groups pianist is the cathedral organist 
and music director 
winter plays soprano saxophone rhonda larson plays flute 
eugene friesen plays the cello and ted moore and glen velez are the 
percussionists 
winter said in an interview he was first inspired to put animal 
sounds in his music when he heard recordings 20 years ago of whale 
songs made off the atlantic island of bermuda 
he and his musicians have played in 33 countries and made 10 
visits to the soviet union where they toured wilderness areas 
i think the only composer who imitated natural sounds before 
us is the frenchman olivier messiaen who notated the songs of all 
french birds winter said 
thanks to mortons enthusiasm for the arts the oxford 
conference had the rare treat of an arts program to itself with 
music songs and sculpture 
it was coordinated by naj wikoff a 38yearold sculptor who 
presents more than 200 drama dance music and poetry performances 
a year at st john the divine 
the conference had its own anthem a 2 piece called alpha 
code the beginning composed by american concert pianist byron 
janis 
the conference is every mans struggle janis said the 
music starts with a prayer then an sos and then the prayer is 
taken up by more and more people and becomes an expression of 
triumph over the problems 
i call it a response to a distress signal from earth because 
thats what the conference is about 
wikoff said no one should see anything unusual in a conference 
grappling with global crises listening to music 
arts celebrate the human spirit and always have done he 
said 
the arts transcend society people need not only food and a 
bed but a sense of hope and beauty

her confessional lyrics were set to long winding 
melodies and described loves past and present and the shadowy 
thoughts a woman might have in the confines of her room at night 
but after a 20year career joni mitchells latest album 
chalk mark in a rain storm shows the canadian singers 
evolution into a tougher more issueoriented chronicler of the era 
these are troubled times said the 44yearold troubadour 
born in the prairie town of ft macleod alberta and now living in 
los angeles 
i think my main function is to try to articulate what it is to 
live in these times to be a scribe or witness to my times its 
fairly neutral reporting 
for her 15th album mitchell and her bassisthusband larry klein 
coproduce 10 songs on such topics as the vietnam war 
commercialism the us bombing of libya and the plight of hopi 
indians 
the project builds on the social commentary mitchell introduced 
in her last album in 1985 dog eat dog which contained a 
savage attack on tv evangelists and addressed the famine in 
ethiopia 
recorded in nine different studios in england and los angeles 
chalk mark includes contributions from willie nelson wayne 
shorter peter gabriel billy idol tom petty and american indian 
actor iron eyes cody it is the most ambitious list of guests on a 
mitchell album to date 
one powerful song the beat of black wings was recorded at 
gabriels ashcombe house studio in bath england near the air base 
from where us bombers took off for the 1986 foray on libyan 
targets 
it was very close and it occurred to all of us that should 
there be a retaliation we were on target mitchell said 
the soviet nuclear accident at chernobyl occurred around the 
same time and all of our thinking turned to war and how small 
the planet was suddenly the globe seems so small and we all seem 
so fragile 
her long blond hair spilling from under a broadbrimmed black 
hat mitchell was relaxed and chatty and the new album reflects 
her less introspective personality with a lighthearted rocker 
dancing clown and a lazilypaced rendition of the old roy 
rogers favorite cool water 
its not an autobiographical album particularly she said 
i dont live there anymore 
born roberta joan anderson the skinny young folksinger from the 
prairies was fresh from art school when she hit the coffee houses 
of torontos yorkville district a quarter of a century ago she 
worked in the womens wear section of a downtown department store 
to pay the rent 
after a brief marriage to folkie chuck mitchell she moved to 
new york where her sinuous melodies and soulbaring lyrics 
attracted judy collins and tom rush to record two of her songs 
both sides now and the circle game 
with a quavering voice as individual as her songpoems mitchell 
soon emerged in her own right with classics such as big yellow 
taxi woodstock and help me 
yet despite a devoted following she never quite won the acclaim 
of a joan baez or judy collins especially after experimenting with 
jazz in albums such as the hissing of summer lawns which 
rolling stone magazine rated the worst record of 1975 
on the other hand the late jazz great charles mingus liked 
mitchells don juans reckless daughter so much that knowing 
he was dying he invited her to collaborate on his last six songs 
and the result was mingus in 1979 future goals she said 
include working with jazz trumpeter miles davis 
all of mitchells albums feature her imaginative paintings and 
designs and she is now marketing her work after discovering that 
limited editions handed out by record companies were selling 
privately for large sums 
it would be nice to have the luxury to do nothing else its 
hard to have two careers she said 
asked to define her contribution to the woodstock generation 
she said bob dylan was the prophet while she chickenscratched 
for immortality 
i wont be remembered for the best of my material she 
lamented listing her own favorites as furry sings the blues 
and song for sharon from the 1976 album hejira and car 
on a hill from court and spark of 1974 
that would make a great golden oldie she said of the latter

this city nelson algren once said has 
literally become my trade 
algren the winner of the first national book award lived among 
the ethnic patches of the northwest side of chicago bringing to 
life the roar of the elevated trains and recording in his mind and 
in notebooks the travails of the people 
he hung out in the police precincts seedy bars and brothels 
drug addicts gamblers and migrant workers had his ear 
the night often was his turf and his fiction breathed the night 
it isnt hard to love a town for its greater and its lesser 
towers algren wrote but you never truly love it till you can 
love its alleys too 
the city he loved didnt always return the sentiment 
poles offended with his sketches of the citys underbelly in 
never come morning pressured some library branches to keep the 
book out of circulation algren and his literary companions 
maintained 
but today seven years after he died at age 72 in sag harbor 
ny theres a romance brewing and it might finally stick 
a large exhibition room at the librarys downtown cultural 
center is the setting for writing in the first person nelson 
algren a rich tribute to a master of urban realism 
first edition books and original manuscripts are paired with 
algrens first stabs at writing including handwritten short 
stories a mock newspapers front page and summaries of 
neighborhood baseball games 
his army draft card is displayed with his honorable discharge 
as well as his detroit birth certificate march 28 1909 and 
papers showing his name change from nelson ahlgren abraham to 
nelson algren 
pictures and personal letters document his affair with french 
philosopher simone de beauvoir who accompanied him on trips down 
the mississippi river and to other countries 
algren admired ernest hemingway and the affection was mutual 
you should not read it unless you can take a punch 
hemingway says in a wellworn letter offering his endorsement for 
an upcoming book 
mr algren hemingway wrote boy you are good 
the exhibit which opened in late february was scheduled to run 
through may 21 but has been extended for three weeks most of the 
items were purchased from local collectors or are on loan from ohio 
state university which has the largest algren archive 
besides the exhibit there also have been public readings 
hundreds turned out to hear pulitzer prize winner studs terkel 
another product of chicagos literary school of realism and a close 
friend of algren read from algrens books including the poetic 
chicago city on the make 
he was a wheel on fire terkel recalled in a interview i 
like the idea that he was honored its time he was given his 
place 
algren who moved to chicago from detroit when he was 3 
graduated from the university of illinois with a journalism degree 
in 1931 his first published works mostly short stories stemmed 
from his experiences in the south where he traveled by freight 
train after college 
algren said he once wandered into a texas college and began 
typing a story on an unattended typewriter he decided to take the 
typewriter with him to chicago to finish the story but was 
arrested for theft and served five months in jail 
back in illinois he was an editor for the works progress 
administration from 193640 finally never come morning about 
a polish prizefighter tagged with a murder charge was published in 
1942 
it was a book that rankled polish civic groups for its gritty 
descriptions of life in their chicago neighborhoods 
he was never a coffee table man terkel said referring to 
algrens books 
in 1947 the american academy of arts and letters awarded him 
1000 in recognition for never come morning and the 
rockefeller foundation granted him 1000 to work on a new novel 
arguably his best the man with the golden arm 
algren received the first national book award in 1950 for the 
man with the golden arm a harrowing tale about frankie machine 
a chicago card dealer back from the war with a 35pound monkey 
on his back morphine addiction 
otto preminger made the book into a movie starring frank 
sinatra but preminger and algren fought fiercely over the 
production and the bitter hollywood experience was one the author 
would never forget 
another book a walk on the wild side also was transferred 
to the big screen starring jane fonda 
he had his detractors conservative critics hit algren for what 
they considered his penchant for glorifying hustlers hookers and 
hobos one once dismissed him as the bard of the stumblebum 
academics the english departments had become the arbiters of 
literature terkel said nelson was never one who was in their 
favor he sort of put them down and they knew it they reciprocated 
by making him a nonperson now hes pretty much a person and thats 
kind of good 
by the early 1970s algren had traveled to southeast asia and 
the far east writing dispatches for magazines and developing more 
books at the same time his ties to chicago began to diminish 
in 1973 he left for good 
but anyone who 12 years earlier had read his afterword to 
chicago city on the make could have predicted the move the 
city that was once a writers town he said was becoming just 
another town 
chicago has progressed culturally from being the second city 
to being the secondhand city he wrote the vital cog in our 
culture now is not the artist but the middleman whose commercial 
status lends art the aura of status when he acquires a collection 
of originals 
the word culture now means nothing more than approved it 
isnt what is exhibited so much that matters as where that being 
where one meets the people who matter

around too it was the ambivalent feeling he had 
algren moved to paterson nj to cover the murder case of 
boxer rubin hurricane carter a novel based on the case the 
devils stocking was published posthumously in 1983 
he settled in sag harbor ny and died relatively poor a few 
weeks before his may 1981 induction into the prestigious american 
academy and institute of arts and letters 
money was an irritating subject to algren authors with less 
talent were wealthy he complained and hollywood producers reaped 
millions without spreading the credit to creators 
but in an interview published in 1964 algren seemed to suggest 
that writing good fiction not collecting cash was his goal 
i think anybody anybody if given the choice would always 
take the privilege of having his work wanted by other people rather 
than the privilege of having more money than anybody

its 2 am and your baby is crying and 
wont sleep 
what to do play the beatles of course and within 15 minutes a 
hard days night becomes much easier 
awardwinning pianist floyd domino has turned the music of the 
fab four into an album of lullabies designed to send bawling 
infants straight to sleepytown 
a lot of adults say it works says the 35yearold musician 
from austin texas 
the album baby road is a takeoff of the beatles 1969 lp 
abbey road it contains 12 songs including 11 hits of the 
famed group and the title track written by domino 
the lp also parodies the abbey road cover which showed the 
four liverpool lads walking single file across a street baby 
road shows four diapered tots strutting one behind the other 
across the road 
these lullabies are dedicated to all children and their tired 
moms and dads domino writes on the album cover 
beatles songs on the lp are hey jude yesterday 
michelle something with a little help from my 
friends norwegian wood for no one in my life 
shes leaving home here there and everywhere and good 
night 
i didnt try to compete with the beatles just be true to 
their music and not use a lot of hot licks said domino who 
played with country star waylon jennings for four years 
he got the idea for the album when his wife was pregnant 
this is so much better than mary had a little lamb he 
said i tried to make them sound as simple as possible but a lot 
of production was involved 
i let the melodies come up by using the upper modes of the 
piano the beatles are very identifiable you can play the melody 
and not be a slave to any original arrangement 
i thought of their songs that could be acoustical and simple 
where you dont tamper with the song and it brings it out some of 
the melodies worked and others would not 
the only other musicians on the lp are edgar meyer who played 
upright bass and guitarist mark howard the selections are 
strictly instrumentals without any lyrics 
a lot of the songs are better without words like shes 
leaving home people think of their daughter leaving or about an 
unhappy teenager domino said in a telephone interview 
he said he chose yesterday for the purity of the medley 
its a song you have to include when you do a beatles lullaby 
record the sound is very simple the guitar carries the rhythm and 
the piano plays the melody well and draws attention to the song 
he said hey jude has a strong emotional impact on people 
especially parents the theme is take a sad song and make it 
better the song means so much to a person because they think of 
the words the song triggers memories and emotions and it makes 
parents so happy to be sharing them with their kids 
domino whos been playing piano since age 5 says he rates 
michelle as the beatles hit with the best melody 
i would play it a lot before i recorded this he recalled 
i always loved playing it 
some beatles songs did not fit well help was too uptempo 
for a peaceful arrangement domino was wary of the stringed 
instruments used in the long and winding road 
let it be he said had an identifiable arrangement and i 
was reluctant to tackle it 
he hopes to do a followup project which like the first will be 
on his own golliber records in austin the next album will include 
some of the beatles songs he had to omit from the first 
domino born and raised in berkeley calif had a featured part 
in the song one oclock jump which won a grammy award in 1978 
for the country group asleep at the wheel 
after leaving the group he played piano in the broadway 
production the best little whorehouse in texas he then joined 
jennings band but quit two years ago in order to spend more time 
at home 
the baby road project has been more rewarding for him than 
playing on the road 
i get great letters from parents saying they are glad i did 
this record he said its been a lot of fun and much more 
personal i save every letter i get 
his 2yearold son will who helped inspire the project has a 
favorite song on the lp something 
but its a winner by default 
hed fall asleep so quickly he never listened all the way 
through domino said

opec oil ministers have failed for the 
time being to agree on a token cut in oil production and oil 
markets reacted swiftly as prices fell today 
saudi arabias oil minister said today he was pleased by the 
collapse of the opec talks which were rescheduled for june 8 
its a very happy ending to a week of intense bargaining 
the minister hisham nazer told reporters as he left the final 
session early this morning 
his comment confirmed that saudi arabia has adopted a hardline 
stance against any production cuts that could give oil prices a 
boost a chief beneficiary of higher prices would be iran which 
relies on oil to finance its war with iraq 
last tuesday the saudi government broke diplomatic relations 
with iran accusing tehran of terrorism and subversion 
the breakdown of negotiations caused oil prices to fall 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
oil the us benchmark crude was down 75 cents a barrel to 1724 
in early trading 
in earlier tokyo trading the price of brent crude oil from the 
north sea was quoted at 1620 a barrel down 45 cents from the 
close in europe on friday 
the london spot or noncontract market was closed for the may 
day holiday and trading elsewhere in europe was extremely light 
ali khalifa alsabah the kuwaiti oil minister said he was not 
worried by the shortterm reaction of traders in the free market 
people who look at the price on tuesday and beyond should take 
heart that opec is trying to put its house in order he said 
other ministers expressed disappointment at the breakdown of 
negotiations which they viewed as a chance to shore up oil prices 
and open a new avenue to cooperation with nonopec producers who 
had proposed the production cuts 
i would be much happier if we could have agreed on cuts now 
said libyan oil minister fawzi shakshuki 
the production cutting proposal was aimed at raising prices to 
opecs target of 18 a barrel from the current range of 14 to 
16 by tightening supplies 
saudi arabia led a minority of four cartel members opposing the 
proposed production cut of 300000 barrels a day or about 2 
percent of the groups total output 
the cuts were to be made in conjunction with the six nonopec 
producers who offered to reduce their output by 5 percent or 
about 200000 barrels a day if the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries would do likewise 
failure by opec to decide on a response to the offer was likely 
to draw criticism from the independent producers who met with an 
opec committee in vienna last tuesday and wednesday 
rilwanu lukman the president of opec said the cartel leaders 
would resume their debate on possible cuts in production at their 
regular summer session in vienna on june 8 
more time is required to clarify some of the points of the 
offer lukman told a news conference this morning he said that 
in the meantime opec members would do their utmost to abide by 
their assigned production quotas which are scheduled to expire 
june 30 
the quotas agreed on last december are designed to support an 
oil price of 18 opec prices have dropped several dollars below 
the target price this spring however prompting the cartel to seek 
collaboration with outside producers 
the six countries involved in the talks with opec were mexico 
egypt china malaysia oman and angola 
opec has solicited the cooperation of independent producers 
since the start of this decade when the development of a world oil 
glut began chipping away at opecs ability to dictate prices 
in 1986 oil prices collapsed falling to less than 10 a barrel 
in july from nearly 30 the previous november 
all opec countries including saudi arabia have said they want 
to foster closer ties with independent oil producers 
the saudis however say they think the nonopec countries 
should bear a bigger share of the burden of reducing supplies in 
the vienna meeting nazer proposed a barrelforbarrel reduction 
with the nonopec group sources said 
in supporting his stand against the proposed cuts nazer told 
the closeddoor meeting that saudi arabia has cut its oil output in 
recent years from 99 million barrels a day to 43 million a far 
larger reduction than any other opec member according to a source 
who was in the meeting 
the saudis were supported by their main allies kuwait qatar 
and the united arab emirates

the supreme court today refused to award 
nearly 3 million in attorneys fees to indian tribes who won a 
lengthy court battle against washington state officials over 
fishing rights 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that struck 
down the award on grounds a federal law reimbursing lawyers who 
represent the winning side in civil rights cases does not apply to 
the indians lawsuit 
twentyone tribes sought to recapture legal fees awarded by a 
federal judge who then was overruled by the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals the indians were supported by 33 other tribes who said 
their ability to vindicate treaty rights could be undermined if 
they are unable to recover legal fees won in court 
the case acted on today stems from a 1970 lawsuit in which 
indians asserted fishing rights in washington state waters based on 
a treaty signed in 1885 
indians relinquished land under the treaty in return for 
guarantees of fishing rights the treaty said the indians have the 
right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations 
in common with all citizens of the territory 
federal courts ultimately ruled the treaty entitled the tribes 
to approximately half the harvestable fish in state waters that 
passed through recognized tribal fishing areas the supreme court 
upheld those rights in 1979 
years of litigation over legal fees followed leading in 1985 to 
a federal judges award of 295 million to the tribes to be paid 
by washington state 
but the 9th circuit court threw out the award last year 
the appeals court said the fishing rights case was not covered 
by a 1976 federal law reimbursing the prevailing sides legal 
expenses in civil rights lawsuits 
the appeals court said in effect that washington state 
officials did not violate deliberately the indians rights by 
limiting their fishing harvest the case was a dispute over the 
intepretation of the treaty the appeals court said 
it is not disputed that the indians had rights under the 
treaty the appeals court said just exactly what those rights 
were was unknown until the supreme court decision in 1979 if the 
state of washington violates these now known and welldelineated 
rights there would be an actual conflict between state and federal 
law which might give rise to a federal civil rights lawsuit 
the appeals court added that however has not yet happened 
and is not the situation here therefore there is no basis for 
the award of legal fees it said 
indians said the ruling could be devastating to their efforts at 
enforcing treaty rights 
cases to vindicate treaty rights affecting important resources 
of an area may take years to complete because of the extreme 
sensitivity of the issuessaid a group of 33 tribes who supported 
the appeal by the washigton tribes such cases are especially 
draining on normally scarce tribal resources 
the case is makah tribe vs state of washington 871390

there are comments that need no further comment 
because they are so clear incisive sage or entertaining there 
are others that claim your attention because they are so rare 
here are some of the latter 
a chairmans letter to stockholders 
wow what a great year not only was the year 1987 the year in 
which your company celebrated its twentyfifth anniversay as a 
company but it did so in grand style 
it was a banner year it was celebrated in part by a 20 
percent increase in revenues and by a better than 300 percent 
increase in net earnings 
this sterling performance was reflected in other ways as well 
our stockholders realized a 17 percent return on average 
stockholders equity the companys liquidity is excellent with 
more than 10 million in cash and certificates as of dec 21 
1987 
the only thing changed in this excerpt from the letter written 
by francis x wazeter chairman of international research and 
development corp is the paragraphing for emphasis since good 
news becomes weighty in such large doses 
it wasnt all he offered in spite of a stock repurchase program 
the amount of cash rose by 65 million the companys longterm 
debt to stockholder equity was a negligible 014 to 10 the 
pension plan was overfunded 
an economic forecasters admission of error 
t thomas juster an economics professor at the university of 
michigan was among those who expected severe economic 
repercussions from the great stock market crash of oct 19 
it hasnt happened yet on the evidence to date says juster 
the us economy has weathered the storm created by the financial 
panic last october and is likely to resume a modest upward path 
after a sluggish first quarter 
among other things he now observes consumers appear to have 
concluded that the stock price decline was an event whose only 
impact was to wipe out a few speculators on wall street but that 
it didnt mean anything to them 
that result he says comes as a surprise to many analysts 
including this writer 
the admission stands out in bold relief because many of his 
colleagues in the forecasting fraternity have never admitted a 
thing and indeed continue to forecast with an assurance that 
suggests no miscalculation ever was made 
a happy bullish stock market forecaster 
as a group stock market forecasters seen unable to restrain 
their pessimism from deteriorating to despair fair economic 
reports are interpreted as omens good news is suspect bad news is 
assembled to prove the case 
they have been doing it with the numbers out of washington if 
the economy shows strength it is viewed as a prelude to inflation 
and higher interest rates if the numbers suggest weakness they 
portend a recession in the making 
seldom does an economist with one of the big institutions 
enunciate his views as boldly as does edward yardeni of 
prudentialbache securities he calls the latest economic reports 
beautiful numbers 
so cheer up he advises everything is going to be fine 
while he expects to see government bond yields below 8 percent 
before the end of the year he asks that bondholders learn to live 
with that because the economy will be doing well and inflation will 
be low 
and he concludes were still rooting for a 2700 dow by 
yearend

phillips petroleum co said monday it 
has designed a plan it hopes will ease employees jitters about a 
possible takeover 
the work force stabilization plan approved by the board of 
directors last week would provide qualified employees with 
severance pay and other benefits should they be terminated without 
cause within two years of a takeover 
chairman cj silas said the plan had been under consideration 
for some time and was not in response to any anticipated takeover 
attempt 
phillips has been mentioned frequently as a takeover 
candidate and the board has been concerned that such speculation 
is affecting our ability to retain and motivate employees and 
therefore how well were able to perform for our current 
shareholders silas said 
phillips fought off unfriendly takeover attempts in 1984 and 
1985 partly as a result of costs incurred in those battles 
phillips has reduced its workforce by nearly onefourth 
the protection plan includes enhanced severance pay of up to two 
years based on years of service retirement benefits home purchase 
provisions and extension of medical dental and life insurance 
benefits 
the plan covers eligible longtime phillips employees on us 
payrolls who are terminated without cause within two years of the 
trigger date or employees who resign after a material loss of 
position salary or benefits

contracts for new construction dropped 3 percent 
in march weakened by a sharp decline in commercial and industrial 
building according to a survey released monday 
the survey conducted by the fw dodge division of mcgrawhill 
information systems co showed that the value of new construction 
contracts on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis fell to 2424 
billion in march from 2497 billion in february 
with the usual winter volatility out of the way march 
contracting data showed that 1988 construction activity is 
beginning to settle into a credible pattern as housing firmed and 
commercial building weakened said george a christie fw dodge 
vice president and chief economist 
we can look for some temporary improvement of housing starts 
in the months ahead as buyers become aware that mortgage rates 
wont be going any lower for a while 
on the other hand christie said commercial building faces the 
prospect of an extended decline as the surplus of office space is 
gradually absorbed 
contracting in march for commercial and industrial projects 
dropped 19 percent from a month earlier although institutional 
building rose 14 percent the survey showed 
the value of newly started residential buildings declined 2 
percent starts of singlefamily homes reached their highest rate 
so far this year but declines in apartment and hotelmotel 
projects more than offset the modest improvement in singlefamily 
building fw dodge said 
contracts for nonbuilding construction mainly public works and 
utilities edged up 1 percent in march highway construction 
rebounded after several sluggish months but march contracts for 
waste water treatment plants declined leaving the total value of 
public works contracts virtually unchanged from february

saudi arabias scuttling of an opec plan 
for token cuts in oil production may signal a stiffened saudi 
resolve to hold down world oil prices and punish archenemy iran 
the saudis appear increasingly intent on frustrating irans 
efforts to galvanize a consensus for oil production cuts that could 
send prices higher this summer 
the result may be more infighting for the fractious 
organization of petroleum exporting countries and perhaps an even 
deeper political paralysis 
prices fell sharply monday after opec decided to suspend talks 
on a proposed 2 percent cutback in oil production until june 
most industry observers had expected the saudis to go along with 
the cutback since it was so small as to have virtually no effect 
on opec evenues an eightcountry majority supported the cuts 
which were to be taken in conjunction with cutbacks by a group of 
six independent oilproducing nations 
the fact that saudi oil minister hisham nazer stood fast against 
the cuts appeared to mean the cartels most influential member is 
unwilling to accept any opec action that could lay the foundation 
for an iranianled price increase 
last december the saudis successfully defeated an iranian 
proposal to raise opecs official price by 270 a barrel to 
2070 
iran relies heavily on oil export revenues to finance its 
7yearold war against iraq saudi arabia has helped bankroll the 
iraqi war effort 
paul mlotok who monitored the opec meeting for the new york 
investment firm salomon brothers inc said he expected oil prices 
to slump this week and then hold steady until opecs june meeting 
iran and other opec members had hoped that by cutting back a 
little on production now when world oil demand is relatively weak 
prices would rebound and then jump even higher this summer during 
the traditional peak season for fuel consumption 
by preventing an accord at the vienna meeting the saudis 
probably ensured that any summer price increases will be small 
limiting the benefit for iran 
this was for the saudis a clear political victory said 
bahman karbassioun a viennabased oil consultant and former member 
of the opec staff 
he said he believed the saudis never had any intention during 
the vienna meeting of striking a compromise deal 
it was a very well organized and well planned effort by the 
saudis to deny iran the agreement it badly wanted he said 
last week two days before the opec meeting started the saudi 
government announced it was breaking diplomatic relations with 
iran it accused tehran of engaging in terrorism and subversion 
kazempour ardebili the deputy iranian oil minister said after 
the saudi announcement that it may have been intended to spoil the 
atmosphere of the vienna meeting 
hashemi rafsanjani speaker of the iranian majlis or 
parliament on sunday said the saudi stalling on oil production 
cuts amounted to flagrant treachery orchestrated by the united 
states 
saudi arabia and iran have been rivals for power and influence 
within opec from the early days of the cartel which was formed in 
1960 but did not gain a grip on pricing until the arab oil embargo 
of 1973 
in 1986 however the saudis and iranians appeared to reach a 
tacit understanding to work together following a price crash that 
sent oil below 10 a barrel 
the fragile alliance began to unravel last summer after rioting 
at the holy city of mecca in saudi arabia killed 402 people most 
of them iranian 
as long as relations between iran and saudi arabia remain poor 
opec is likely to encounter major problems holding oil prices 
steady let alone raising them to the official target of 18 a 
barrel

ltv corp reported its profit rose 127 percent in 
the first quarter from a year earlier boosted by gains from the 
companys reorganization under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
laws 
the diversified steel and aerospace giant said monday that its 
firstquarter profit increased to 1639 million or 116 a share 
from 1296 million or 1 a share in the first three months of 
1987 
the figure for the latest quarter includes a onetime special 
credit of 248 million resulting from the sale of two iron ore 
vessels 
the rise in net income occurred despite a decline in 
firstquarter sales to 188 billion from 191 billion a year 
earlier 
the deferral of interest pension and other costs while we are 
operating under the protection of chapter 11 has greatly benefited 
both periods said raymond a hay ltvs chairman and chief 
executive officer the company entered chapter 11 protection from 
creditors in july 1986 
hay noted however that the deferrals of costs and expenses 
have resulted in claims which must be provided for in a plan of 
reorganization before ltv can emerge from bankruptcy 
in january 1987 the federal pension benefit guaranty corp 
terminated and took control of the three pension plans of 
subsidiary ltv steel co assuming financial responsibility for 
23 billion in unfunded liabilities 
but in september the pension agency returned trusteeship of the 
plans to ltv saying it took the step to curb abuse of the federal 
pension insurance program it cited 252 million in profits the 
company reported for the first half of 1987 and ltvs establishment 
of a new pension arrangement for its workers 
ltv has said it believes the agencys attempt to return 
trusteeship of the pension plans is illegal 
excluding the special credit for the sale of the vessels the 
company said its operating income for the quarter rose to 151 
million from 1397 million a year earlier because of higher income 
from steel 
operating income from steel rose to 1312 million from 1011 
million in the first quarter of 1987 while steel sales expanded to 
13 billion from 12 billion 
income from ltvs aircraft products division dropped to 113 
million from 222 million largely because of reduced activity 
following completion of the b1b bomber program in the fourth 
quarter of 1987 
income from the energy products division rose to 26 million 
from 900000 in the first three months of 1987

the oil ministers of saudi arabia and 
kuwait said monday they expected world oil prices to stabilize near 
current levels despite the breakdown of an opec meeting 
but prices on world markets fell sharply after the opec 
conference ended with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut in 
the groups oil production 
on the new york mercantile exchange monday west texas 
intermediate oil the us benchmark crude dropped 85 cents a 
barrel to settle at 1714 prices for refined products also slid 
asked by reporters if he thought prices would fall further in 
response to the stalemate saudi oil minister hisham nazer said 
i dont see why i see market fundamentals improving 
he was referring to projections that oil demand in the main 
industrialized countries will pick up this summer relieving some 
of the downward pressure on prices 
nazer also said he was optimistic about gaining more cooperation 
from nonopec oil exporters including american oilproducing 
states 
the oil states in the united states are very very much 
interested in the stabilization of the market he said 
kent hance a member of the texas railroad commission that 
regulates that states oil industry held talks with nazer and 
other opec officials last week in vienna 
hance told them texas wanted to open a dialogue with the oil 
cartel despite washingtons refusal to take such a step 
nazer and ali khalifa alsabah the kuwaiti oil minister told 
separate news conferences that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries was not worried by shortterm reactions in the 
oil market 
our concern is not what happened on monday or tuesday but 
what happens to prices in the medium or long term alsabah said 
at its current oil production rate of about 175 million barrels 
a day opec stands to lose 122 million a week for each 1 drop in 
prices 
nazer said his government was confident that prices will 
stabilize near opecs target of 18 a barrel in the longer term 
we wouldnt pay any attention to shortterm gyrations he 
said 
the opec oil ministers had come to vienna hoping to reach 
agreement with a group of six independent oilproducing nations on 
mutual export reductions 
the nonopec group mexico egypt china oman angola and 
malaysia offered to cut exports by 5 percent or about 200000 
barrels a day if opec did likewise 
opec member algeria proposed that the cartel cut its output by 
300000 barrels a day or about 2 percent in order to establish a 
basis for a more formal relationship with the rival producers 
but saudi arabia backed by kuwait qatar and the united arab 
emirates blocked the proposal saying opec should take more time 
to consider a response 
alsabah the kuwaiti minister told reporters opec also should 
clear up some internal problems before deciding on new methods of 
cooperation with other producers 
he said the lack of agreement within opec on such technical 
issues as how to ensure compliance with oil production quotas made 
any new agreements on production cuts meaningless 
we all realized that the extent of the problem is much greater 
than just cutting output now by a token amount he said 
he said an opec committee would study the technical issues 
before the next ministerial conference set for june 8 
also a separate opec committee of five oil ministers is to hold 
bilateral and group meetings with the six nonopec countries prior 
to june he said

managers of fairfax publications us said 
monday they have agreed to buy ms and sassy magazines from the 
companys australian parent for an undisclosed price 
sandra yates president and chief executive of the newly formed 
matilda publications inc and anne summers matildas vice 
president said they expected to close the deal on may 20 
yates said no changes were planned at either monthly magazine 
john fairfax ltd based in sydney australia acquired ms 
magazine last september unconfirmed reports had placed the 
purchase price at between 10 million and 15 million 
sassy a new magazine aimed at teenage girls was launched in 
march yates had previously estimated startup costs at 10 million 
fairfax was taken private in december and yates said the 
company decided to sell the magazines to pay off some of its debts 
yates said she and summers held an option to purchase the 
magazines and they decided to exercise it after arranging 
financing from an unidentified venture capital group and the new 
york office of state bank of new south wales 
this financial deal provides us with the best opportunity for 
the growth of ms and sassy while maintaining their 
independence she said 
she said the working capital we have been able to secure is 
equivalent to what fairfax would have invested had their plans 
remained intact 
ms which was founded 16 years ago by gloria steinem and pat 
carbine has recently increased its rate base to 500000 copies a 
month from 450000 
no circulation figures have been released for sassy but yates 
said the magazine has well and truly made its rate base of 
250000 
she said other parties had inquired about the magazines but she 
was unaware of any other firm bids for the two publications which 
were put up for sale in the middle of march

a surge in imports caused japans merchandise trade 
surplus to fall 72 percent to 943 billion in the 1987 fiscal 
year the finance ministry announced monday 
the report confirmed the continuing strength of japans economy 
in spite of the strong japanese yen which hurts the 
competitiveness of japanese products in domestic and overseas 
markets 
exports grew 105 percent to 2334 billion but imports grew 
even faster rising 269 percent to 1391 billion both figures 
measured on a balanceofpayments basis were records 
the report did not provide a breakdown of where japans imports 
were coming from but other recent figures have shown that the 
biggest growth is from the newly industrialized countries of hong 
kong taiwan south korea and singapore 
growth of imports from the united states has been sluggish 
the trade surplus of 9428 billion in the fiscal year ended 
march 31 although smaller than the 1986 surplus of 10165 
billion was the second highest on record 
the report demonstrated that japan is still able to increase its 
exports at a doubledigit pace in spite of the drag of the strong 
yen at the same time japans burgeoning consumer economy is 
sucking in more imports 
imports have also risen because japanese exporters are getting 
more of their components from abroad 
finance ministry officials noted that the composition of 
japanese imports has shifted with a larger share now consisting of 
manufactured goods rather than raw materials 
government programs aimed at reducing trade friction by limiting 
the economys reliance on exports and encouraging domestic demand 
played a role in cutting the trade surplus 
although the higher value of the japanese yen had an effect 
the main cause of the fall in the trade surplus is the governments 
program to boost imports the official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
these statistics show that the governments effort to change 
the countrys industrial structure and reduce our dependence on 
exports has been successful another ministry official said also 
speaking anonymously 
the countrys current account surplus also plunged almost 10 
billion during the fiscal year for its first decline in six years 
the ministry said 
the current account includes capital transfers and trade in 
goods and services to measure a nations commerce the ministry

highlevel negotiations monday in their dispute over increasing the 
sale of american beef and oranges in japan 
neither side would disclose whether or how much progress was 
made in the round of talks japanese agriculture minister takashi 
sato started last wednesday with us trade representative clayton 
yeutter 
the two cabinetlevel officials met both monday morning and 
afternoon and tentatively scheduled another session for tuesday 
sources said 
us officials would say only they continued to insist on 
removal of japanese import quotas the two countries agreed to in a 
1984 accord that expired last month otherwise the issue will be 
pursued before gatt general agreement on trade and tariffs at its 
meeting wednesday in geneva they said 
japanese officials said a major issue was timing of the 
removal they declined to confirm tokyo news reports of various 
japanese proposals for a three or fiveyear interval before full 
lifting of the barriers 
japan is the major customer for us farm products but its 
domestic livestock and citrus producers have insisted on the quotas 
on imports of beef oranges and orange juices as vital to their 
livelihood us exporters have argued that as a result japanese 
consumers are paying more than double the fair price for beef and 
oranges

as part of its inflationfighting program 
mexico will hold the peso currency at its current value against the 
us dollar until the end of the year treasury secretary gustavo 
petricioli said 
petricioli told local reporters late sunday that economic 
conditions permit the government to continue a freeze on the 
exchange rate that has been in effect since march his remarks were 
reported in mondays newspapers 
the treasury chief said that any change in the exchange rate 
would give a kick to the inflation rate 
there are people interested in continuing inflation because 
this makes the rich richer and the poor poorer he said 
a new slide in the exchange rate he said would be 
inflationary and the great majority of the mexicans want stability 
in order to raise the standard of living 
he predicted that consumer prices would rise about 2 percent a 
month by the middle of this year well under the record 155 
percent in january 
starting from then the effort will continue so that this 
administration ends with very small inflation which will establish 
the bases for a firm and sustained development petricioli said 
president miguel de la madrids sixyear term expires at the end 
of november he is virtually certain to be succeeded by carlos 
salinas de gortari the presidential nominee of the ruling 
institutional revolutionary party 
salinas de gortaris presidential aspirations would be given a 
sharp boost if the government were successful in sharply paring 
back the inflation rate the presidential elections will be held 
july 6 
de la madrid quickly fashioned the economic solidarity pact in 
december after consumer prices surged dramatically in all of 1987 
the inflation rate was a record 1592 percent 
as part of the solidarity pact the government announced in 
march a freeze on the prices of goods and services it regulates and 
the pesodollar exchange rate 
it extended the freeze in april and may and announced the 
minimum wage for unskilled workers also would be held steady during 
those two months 
the government announced that consumer prices rose 83 percent 
in february and 51 percent in march 
the exchange rate was 2241 to 2273 pesos to the dollar on 
monday in the controlled market which is used in about 75 percent 
of all commercial transactions 
the free rate used in tourism and for transactions along the 
usmexico border was 2260 to 2280 pesos to the dollar 
in middecember the government devalued the currency to 2200 
pesos to the dollar

italys secondlargest bank said monday it was 
seeking to acquire a majority stake in irving bank corp but 
analysts said swaying shareholders away from bank of new york cos 
competing hostile bid remains an uphill battle 
banca commerciale italiana spa which had sought a 45 percent 
stake in irving said it will seek to purchase 95 million irving 
shares or about 51 percent of the new yorkbased bank 
the staterun italian bank is offering 75 a share the same 
price as under its previous plan that sought to purchase 85 
million shares in addition banca commerciale said it would pay 
intererst on the pershare purchase price from may 31 until the 
deal closes 
banca commerciale also said it continues to contemplate 
paying irving shareholders a special 10ashare dividend on 
remaining shares if it is successful in acquiring the bank 
irvings board approved the amended offer and recommended 
shareholders tender to it but analysts were less enthusiastic 
i dont think most investors will bother studying it said 
virginia adair an analyst at merrill lynch amp co i think it will 
be treated as fairly insignificant 
irving said the offer which hinges on a complex restructuring 
has a blended value of between 6520 and 7255 a share a slight 
increase over its previous offer 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said his company would not 
increase its bid adding that the stock market has chosen to 
ignore bcis proposal 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange irving rose 
12 cents to close at 6162 a share bank of new york rose 12 
cents to close at 3050 a share 
bank of new york which holds a 5 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings 185 million shares outstanding or about 108 billion 
the bank also is waging a proxy fight by running a slate of 16 
candidates for election to irvings board at a shareholders meeting 
scheduled for may 6 
as of last friday about 10 million irving shares had been 
tendered under bank of new yorks buyout offer of roughly 64 a 
share those shares coupled with the 888634 shares bank of new 
york already owns give the bank a 592 percent stake in irving 
the company said 
the tender offer was extended monday for a fourth time it will 
expire at noon edt friday 
separately banca commerciale said italys central bank has 
indicated it has no objection to banca commerciales purchase of a 
controlling interest in irving but the bank of italys support did 
little to quell analysts more serious concerns over domestic 
regulatory approval 
because the ownership structure of the italian bank is part 
industrial and part government analysts believe approval from the 
federal reserve could be hard to come by 
a banca commercialeirving combination would violate our 
domestic laws on bank holding companies adair said 
some observers suggested that banca commerciales willingness to 
pay interest on its payout to shareholders is an admission that the 
deal could run into regulatory snags 
the interest gives some protection about a prolonged approval 
process while shareholders are waiting for the fed to make up its 
mind said stephen berman an analyst with county securities usa 
to some extent its kind of a recognition of the potential 
tieup of share for a long time he added 
bank of new york received conditional approval from the fed and 
the new york state banking boards in march and began its tender 
offer shortly after 
banca commerciales stock purchase is part of a complex 
restructuring proposed by irving that includes several costcutting 
measures and asset sales 
to that end irving said it will sell its 39 percent equity 
interest in banca della svizzera italiana to the swissbased 
financial firm unigestion sa for 390 million in cash irving 
estimates a pretax gain of 136 million or 5 per share from the 
transaction 
the bank also said it would sell its 50story building at one 
wall street both transactions are expected to fund the special 10 
dividend payout 
irving chairman joseph rice said in a statement that the banks 
board greatly appreciates the willingness of bci to improve its 
offer if the deal were consumated banca commerciale would have 
the right to buy an additional 10 percent of irving stock on the 
open market

american steel companies put 955 percent of 
their production capacity into use last week the highest 
percentage in nearly nine years the american iron and steel 
institute reported monday 
but the trade group noted that actual output was far below that 
of nine years ago because production capacity has been slashed due 
to competition from foreign mills us producers now have a 
maximum capacity of about 112 million tons a year compared with 
just over 155 million tons when they operated at 963 percent of 
capacity in the last week of 1979 the group said 
according to the groups latest report steel production rose to 
2046 million tons in the week ended april 30 an increase of 39 
percent from the previous weeks 1970 million tons the capacity 
percentage was up from 919 percent the previous week

americans increased their efficiency in 
producing goods and services at an annual rate of nearly 1 pecent 
last quarter the government said monday in one of three reports 
showing a robust us economy 
nonfarm businesses improved their productivity by an annual 
rate of 09 percent from january through march reversing a 1 
percent deterioration in their efficiency during the previous three 
months the labor department said 
excluding agriculture and government those businesses 
responsible for threefourths of the nations economic activity 
raised their output of goods and services by 27 percent with only 
a 17 percent increase in hours worked 
meanwhile the commerce department said orders for us 
manufactured products increased 16 percent in march while 
construction spending rose by 15 percent much of it on government 
building and highway projects 
everything is coming up roses said allen sinai of the 
boston co a new yorkbased economic consultant a little 
trouble on the inflation front and in the financial markets is not 
a strong price to pay for this kind of super performance on growth 
jobs and spending its an incumbent politicians dream 
meanwhile on wall street monday bluechip issues staged a 
modest rally but the rest of the stock market lagged in a sluggish 
session the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1094 to 
204327 but declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 
to 3 on the new york stock exchange 
the dollar was mixed against major currencies bond prices fell 
oil futures prices turned sharply lower in a wave of selling 
prompted by the failure of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to set temporary production cuts on the new york 
mercantile exchange west texas intermediate oil the us 
benchmark crude slid to 1714 per barrel for june delivery down 
85 cents from fridays close 
the increase in factory orders to a seasonally adjusted 21608 
billion in march after no change in february and a decrease in 
january was seen as coming from both domestic and foreign markets 
while an export boom has been occuring for several months 
analysts had seen little in trade figures to indicate that the 
devaluation of the dollar had made imports expensive enought to 
curb americans appetitites for them 
these orders show that domestic auto and clothing makers are 
starting to displace the tide of imports said lawrence 
chimerine president of the wefa group formerly wharton 
econometrics in bala cynwyd pa theres still no booming demand 
in consumer spending 
the rise in construction spending was led by a 54 percent surge 
in government projects some of the result of congress overriding 
president reagans veto of an 88 billion highway bill last year 
the productivity gains were a surprise to most economists in the 
wake of employment reports showing the creation of nearly 1 million 
new jobs the first three months of 1988 
the economy is not quite as strong as the employment data 
suggest said donald straszheim chief economist for merrill 
lynch in fact the productivity numbers look pretty good 
they showed wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of 
34 percent in the first quarter raising the labor costs 
associated with each service or product by 24 percent annually 
but those unit labor costs had soared at an annual rate of 45 
percent in the final quarter of 1987 triggering fears among 
several analysts that the nation was on the verge of wagepush 
inflation 
productivity is the cushion you can put in between wage 
increases and price increases this is good news for inflation 
said david wyss an economist for data resources inc of lexington 
mass 
after taking inflation into account as measured by relative 
changes in total output and prices the wage gains the first 
quarter of 1988 yielded not a penny more of purchasing power for 
workers still it is the first time since the last quarter of 1986 
that they have even kept pace with inflation 
manufacturing which still accounts for about onefourth of the 
countrys gross national product continued to lead the effort in 
restoring us competitivness 
productivity by manufacturers increased at an annual rate of 29 
percent the first quarter with a 43 percent increase in output on 
only a 13 percent increase in the number of hours worked in the 
nations factories 
for the first time since early 1986 factory workers actually 
kept ahead of inflation according to the data 
nominal wage gains averaging 39 percent annually the first 
quarter the biggest in more than two years increased the 
purchasing power of assembly line workers by onehalf of 1 percent 
their purchasing power had dropped 22 percent in 1987 according 
to the data 
the wage and benefit increases also raised the labor costs 
associated with each item coming off the factory floor an average 1 
percent compared with a nearly 2 percent decline in unit labor 
costs in 1987 
with unemployment rates at low as they are you are going to 
see some upward pressure on wages said merrill lynchs 
straszheim thats good news for wage earners bad for wage 
payers and accordingly for inflation 
most economists doubt that the united states can maintain the 
first quarters productivity gains the rest of the year 
particularly if joblessness remains at or near its current level of 
56 percent 
output is limited by capacity in some industries which points 
to more hours and sharper increases in labor costs for the rest of 
the year said sinai that in turn will hurt profits and add to 
inflationary pressures companies often try to increase prices off 
of rising labor costs

nothing for the new york market to lead into because the tokyo

less from cheaper oil than the importreliant economies of japan 
and western europe

precious metals futures prices plunged along with those for 
crude oil and refined oil products monday following the failure of 
opec oil ministers to agree on production cuts 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mixed cattle 
and livestock were mostly higher and stockindex futures advanced 
the discord within the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries was seen as negative for the inflationsensitive precious 
metals because it suggests a continuation of low oil prices and 
low inflation 
analysts also cited the steady dollar and a lack of buying from 
europe where banks and government offices were closed for may day 
as reasons for the sharp drop in gold and silver futures 
but it was primarily the opec news and the effect that might 
have on inflation or the lack thereof said john norris chief 
precious metals trader for citibank in new york 
norris said other economic signals that affect metals prices 
have been confusing and individual investors have been notably 
absent from the metals markets leaving the markets prone to 
weakness 
the signals are so mixed that no one is taking a firm view one 
way or another he said 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 540 to 
550 lower with the contract for delivery in june at 44720 a 
troy ounce silver was 145 cents to 154 cents lower with may at 
6353 a troy ounce 
saudi arabia took a hard line against opec production cuts at 
the cartels meeting in vienna austria which ended sunday the 
opec oil ministers will meet again june 8 and may resume talks on 
tightening supplies to raise prices to the cartels target of 18 
but if the saudis remain staunchly opposed to production cuts 
it could conceivably mean well see a futher move on the 
downside said nauman barakat energy futures analyst in new york 
with smith barney harris upham amp co 
in trading monday west texas intermediate crude oil settled 60 
cents to 85 cents lower with june at 1714 a barrel heating oil 
was 189 cents to 242 cents lower with june at 4595 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 150 cents to 224 cents lower with 
june at 4937 cents a gallon 
wheat futures fell sharply on the chicago board of trade while 
corn finished higher and soybeans were nearly unchanged 
analysts tied the lower wheat prices to weekend rains and the 
higher corn prices to a lack thereof corn also was supported by a 
favorable export outlook they said 
soybeans for may delivery traded as high as 698 a bushel 
during the session but prices retreated on late profittaking said 
dale gustafson an analyst in chicago with drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
the agricultre department reported monday that 80 percent of the 
winter wheatcrop was in fair condition as of sunday with 15 
percent rated good and 5 percent excellent 
the usda also reported 78 percent of the spring wheat crop was 
planted as of sunday compared to 61 percent a year ago and well 
ahead of the average of 42 percent for that date and 36 percent of 
the corn crop planted behind the yearago figure of 43 percent but 
ahead of the average of 24 percent 
wheat settled 2 cents to 7 cents lower with may at 3 a bushel 
corn was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 205 a bushel 
oats were cent to 1 cent lower with may at 158 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with may unchanged at 
689 a bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures finished mostly 
higher on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 25 cent lower to 50 cent higher with june at 
7065 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 35 cent 
higher with may at 7870 cents a pound hogs were unchanged to 43 
cent higher with june at 4917 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 15 cent to 128 cent higher with may at 5195 cents a pound 
stockindex futures advanced slightly on the chicago mercantile

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home rose in march to the highest level 
this year as growth in incomes and lower mortgage rates offset 
higher home prices a real estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said its affordability 
index climbed to 1142 in march up from a revised february level 
of 1137 
the march number means that a family earning the median income 
of 31526 annually had 142 percent more income than needed to 
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of 
a medianpriced home 
the affordability index which has been above 100 since june 
1986 should remain in the positive range for the rest of the year 
although they predicted it would probably be pushed slightly lower 
in the months ahead because of rising mortgage rates 
we have seen the best news in interest rates in 1988 our 
forecast is for interest rates to drift upward for the rest of the 
year said john tuccillo the associations chief economist 
the change in the index last month reflected a rise in the 
median price of a home which climbed to 88700 this was offset 
by a 05 percent increase in incomes and a drop in a composite 
mortgage rate to 908 percent down from 916 percent the previous 
month the composite rate reflects changes in both fixedrate and 
adjustablerate mortgages
