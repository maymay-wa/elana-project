villagers from klukwan have paid an art 
dealer in new mexico an undisclosed sum for what is believed to be 
a 112yearold peace treaty between the stikeen and chilkat indians 
the treaty ended 12 years of bloodshed between the tribes 
the documents was signed perhaps in blood at fort wrangell in 
1876 by chief shakes of the stikeen indians and chief seguasha of 
the chilkat indians 
the treaty wound up in the collection of santa fe nm art 
dealer david kramer villagers from klukwan bought the document 
from him last week 
klukwan where descendants of the chilkats still live is 
located in the chilkat bald eagle reserve about 22 miles north of 
haines it is the oldest tlingit settlement in southeastern alaska 
the chilkat and stikeen tribal groups were part of the tlingit 
nation 
after the treaty is authenticated it will be put on display at 
the planned klukwan eagle observatory and cultural heritage center 
construction of the center should be completed in three years said 
klukwan heritge foundation president janice clayton hill 
the treaty includes a pair of red wax seals with narrow ribbons 
next to the chiefs marks and a blue seal indicating it arrived at 
fort sitka on feb 3 1876 
kramer said he has had the treaty for about 10 years he said he 
bought it from the estate of an indian artifact collector who 
obtained it in seattle in the early 1970s 
after being contacted by an associate of kramer hill said she 
and village council president joe hotch questioned elders and dug 
up old records to verify there were battles between the chilkats 
and stikeens in that time period and apparently a treaty 
we got enough information to make us realize the historical 
importance of this to us she said 
kramer said variations in coloration in the documents text 
indicate it may have been written and signed in blood it appears 
to be blood but it would take a test to confirm it he said

the united states and the soviet union are 
resolving what officials describe as a minor incident in which 
american technical experts removed some materials as souvenirs 
from a soviet nuclear test site without authorization 
the three us experts are being relieved of their duties as 
members of an american team assigned to monitor soviet atomic 
blasts they were in the soviet union at the semipalatinsk test 
site as part of a joint verification program when the incident 
occurred last month 
administration spokesmen said friday the items found by soviet 
authorities in crates being prepared for shipment back home 
included a small hammer a piece of barbed wire and several rock 
and core samples from a hole being drilled at the site 
state department spokesman charles redman said that after 
consultations with soviet authorities it was decided that the 
three who were not identified will not return to the testing site 
next month 
one was said to be an energy department employee and the other 
two reportedly were working under energy department contracts 
the soviets expressed concern over the incident but no formal 
protest was lodged redman said 
according to redman the issue has been discussed at length 
between us and soviet authorities and is being resolved 
he added that the joint monitoring program will continue with a 
us test set for aug 17 in nevada and the soviet test scheduled 
for midseptember 
redman said the hammer and the barbed wire were intended as 
personal souvenirs as for the geological samples the americans 
asked the soviets for permission to remove the items and had reason 
to believe the request would be approved he said 
these items were of a minor nature certainly not of any 
military or technical significance redman said describing the 
incident as a misunderstanding 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said we dont believe it was intelligence activity of any kind 
but it was a personal mistake on their part 
asked whether it wasnt strange for americans to try to make off 
with rocks and soil redman said if youre involved in this kind 
of work those might be considered souvenirs 
the washington post reported in fridays editions that the soil 
and rock samples are regarded by us officials as potentially 
useful in assessing yields of soviet nuclear blasts 
one official told the post that soil samples can be examined for 
radioactive contamination which might reveal the type and quantity 
of nuclear materials used in nuclear bombs 
but redman said the rock and core samples were of the same type 
as that already provided to us experts by the soviets

a procter and gamble co official denies that 
the corporation has used first lady nancy reagans name for profit 
in its effort to support her just say no program to stop drug 
abuse among youngsters 
gerald s gendell pampgs public affairs manager said from 
cincinnati on friday that the allegations made by rep charles b 
rangel dny chairman of the house drug committee and two 
former employees of the antidrug program were unjustified 
selfserving and without merit 
gendell said the remarks by tom adams who resigned as president 
of the just say no foundation last week were very 
disappointing in that he now takes this action in this 
vengeful unjustified attack on procter and gamble placing the 
very organization he expresses concern for in jeopardy 
rangel with adams and joan brann former vice president of the 
foundation at his side criticized the exclusive use and alleged 
commercialization of the first ladys name by procter and gamble in 
the antidrug program 
i dont think anyone has the exclusive right to the first 
ladys picture the white house and the kids that write in 
rangel told reporters at a news conference at the capitol i 
would like procter and gamble to say this program makes sense we 
will support it but i dont want them to say other companies cant 
join 
gendell said the exclusivity with the antidrug program was for 
the period of a particular promotion which he said is standard 
procedure in any causerelated marketing effort 
ww abbott of procter and gamble who is chairman of the 
foundation asked adams and brann to resign gendell said abbott 
asked adams to resign because when abbott took over the foundation 
job in february he had an audit done which revealed a major 
financial and management problem the organization was more 
than 600000 in debt and it was threatened with a lawsuit for an 
additional alleged debt of 130000 
adams would not accept responsibility for these financial 
problems even though he was the foundations chief executive since 
its formation gendell said he said he did not know until friday 
that brann had resigned 
i would like wallace abbott to resign return the program to 
its grass roots and then apologize to the children and parents 
adams said 
adams said he does not believe mrs reagan was involved in the 
exclusive contract with procter and gamble which he said donated 
150000 to the program it was her chief of staff he said 
jack l courtemanche the first ladys chief of staff was not 
available immediately for comment 
abbott also was not available but gendell said the 
allegations by congressman rangel and mr adams about procter and 
gamble and the just say no program are unjustified selfserving 
and totally without merit 
the corporation is involved in the program gendell said 
because we feel it is a very worthwhile undertaking which is 
doing work in helping prevent drug abuse 
the companys efforts and substantial financial contributions 
have been directed at trying to save this program not take it over 
as claimed by mr adams he said we also strongly deny the 
allegations that we have in any way abused the just say no program 
procter and gambles participation had the full support of mrs 
reagan and the white house staff any use of her name was cleared 
in advance 
he also said procter and gamble has given the program more than 
150000 which was for a campaign last year he said the company 
has committed 250000 to retire the foundations debt of 600000 
and given 150000 this year 
rangel said he does not believe the white house had anything to 
do with the commercialization of the drug program in which blank 
donation pledges to assist the antidrug foundation were included in 
a mailing to 48 million households along with coupons for proctor 
and gamble products such as soap cooking oil coffee and diapers 
the new york congressman said he is disturbed that the 
foundation and its volunteers are being used to increase sales 
of proctor and gamble products 
rangel gave out a march 23 1987 letter from procter and gamble 
to the foundation in which the company said all competition by 
other retailers must be eliminated any breech of this 
agreement the letter said will preclude procter and gambles 
interest in supporting just say no in years to come 
the letter also says that the company was excited about teaching 
youngsters to stay drug free but we remind you that our primary 
objective is build the business 
clearly it was never the first ladys intention to allow a 
soap company to use this program and the children of our nation for 
commercial profit said rangel

the environmental protection agency says a 
record 25 million settlement involving a commercial hazardous 
waste facility in louisiana should send the message to other 
companies that failure to comply with environmental rules will 
prove costly 
epa will not tolerate hazardous waste mismanagement in this 
country especially by the nations major disposal companies epa 
administrator lee m thomas said in announcing the settlement 
friday 
this significant penalty should send a signal to all waste 
handlers that the cost of noncompliance with our requirements will 
be more costly than compliance thomas said 
a federal and state suit against cecos international inc a 
subsidiary of houstonbased browningferris inc had charged more 
than 1700 violations of federal environmental regulations at the 
firms disposal facility in livingston la about 40 miles east of 
baton rouge 
the settlement represented the highest penalty ever obtained in 
a hazardous waste court case said robin woods an epa spokeswoman 
epa said inspections of the facility in 198586 had found 
violations such as landfilling of ignitable waste failure to 
analyze hazardous waste properly unauthorized waste piles 
inadequate recordkeeping and failure to conduct facility 
inspections and personnel training 
under terms of a consent decree filed in us district court in 
baton rouge cecos is to pay 11 million to the federal 
government 900000 to the state of louisiana and 500000 to 
louisiana state university to fund environmental education programs 
cecos based in buffalo ny also has agreed to implement an 
advanced computer tracking system and to carry out a series of 
independent environmental audits at the livingston facility the 
company said 
the audits are intended to be a comprehensive check on the 
facilitys compliance with the clean water act the resource 
conservation and recovery act and the clean air act the company 
said 
this is a good solid agreement cecos president robert v 
price said in a statement while it is critical for the public to 
understand that the facility at no time was a threat to public 
health this settlement nevertheless is important because it gets 
the issues and the lawsuit behind us it sets in motion new 
programs not required by law that will make our facility one of 
the safest in the business 
the consent decree a legal document settling the lawsuit 
becomes final after a 30day public review and comment period and 
approval by the court

the environmental protection agency is 
threatening ford motor co with 230000 in penalties for allegedly 
failing to fix defective emissions control components under 
warranty 
the automaker said it hoped something could be worked out and 
accused the agency of changing its interpretation of the federal 
law that sets standards for automotive emissions 
an epa notice of violation made public friday said ford in 23 
instances from 1984 through this year denied warranty service for 
emissioncontrol components that failed because a noncovered 
component 
the epas field operations director richard kozlowski said the 
agencys position reflects the meaning of the clean air act of 1974 
the act is the act and it refers to the vehicle meeting 
emissions standards not the particular parts he said 
ford however said the agency should change rules that apply 
industrywide rather than singling out ford 
it is not a new issue said donald buist fords automotive 
emissions and fuel economy director in dearborn mich what weve 
got here is a new interpretation of a longstanding emissions 
policy 
kozlowski however said epas interpretation is one weve had 
from day one 
our point is that if the manifold fails in a way that causes 
the catalyst to fail replacing the catalyst on the warranty 
doesnt fix the problem he said it will fail again and again 
the only way to fix the problem so the vehicle meets standards is 
to replace the part that causes the failure 
he said other automakers whether they do it for goodwill to 
keep us off their back or whether they believe it is covered 
fix emissionrelated components whose failure is caused by 
noncovered equipment and the epa believes ford should do the same 
the epa said the 230000 in civil penalties could be lessened 
if ford were to change its policy on emissiondefect warranties 
should ford and epa not settle the complaint within 90 days the 
agencys normal procedure would be to refer the matter to the 
justice department with a recommendation that a civil complaint be 
filed in federal court the notice of violation said 
buist said ford intends to resolve the matter through 
discussions with the epa resolution means to the satisfaction 
of both parties he said 
the epa notice of violation dated aug 5 was made public by 
the coalition for auto repair choice a trade association 
representing the auto parts and repair industries 
both ford and the epa acknowledged that the notice had been 
issued 
a spokeswoman for the coalition pamela kostmayer declined to 
say how the epa notice was obtained

it will be easier for military authorities to 
advise the spouses of reservists if their mates test positively for 
the deadly aids virus under new guidelines issued by deputy defense 
secretary william h taft iv 
under a 1987 policy statement if military personnel tested 
positively and agreed to provide the names of his or her sexual 
partners to medical authorities for counseling the military doctor 
could relay those names to local health officials unless prohibited 
by state law 
that policy has now been expanded to say the military doctor can 
directly contact the spouse of a reservist if that reservist has 
tested positively the spouse may then be offered aids testing and 
counseling at a military hospital or clinic taft decided even 
though the spouse of a reservist is not normally eligible for 
military health care 
the guidelines continue to allow doctors to notify spouses of 
active duty personnel 
the policy statement issued friday extends the pentagons aids 
testing program for another year continuing the mandatory blood 
screening for all military personnel on active duty all reservists 
and national guard members and all men and women seeking to join 
the armed services 
it further continues the practice of allowing military personnel 
who test positively to remain on active duty until they show signs 
of the actual disease 
however it rejects for the time being mandatory testing of 
civilian defense employees destined for overseas posts such 
civilian workers will be tested only if they are being assigned to 
a foreign country whose government requires such a test 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys 
immune system and its ability to resist infection no cure has been 
found most of its victims are homosexuals intravenous drug users 
and people receiving tainted blood transfusions although the 
disease also is spreading through sexual contacts to the general 
population 
as of monday aids had been diagnosed in 70208 americans of 
whom more than half or 39620 have died since june 1981 according 
to the federal centers for disease control no one is known to have 
recovered from aids 
the defense department under policy statements first adopted in 
late 1985 conducts the largest aids screening program in the 
world more than 4 million individuals have been tested under the 
program which the pentagon justifies primarily on the need to 
protect military blood supplies 
the latest policy continued the practice of prohibiting any 
recruit applicant from joining the military a college rotc program 
or attending a military academy if he or she tests positively for 
aids

george bush wanted a 1988 republican party 
platform full of specifics he got it more than 30000 words of 
details and rhetoric about leadership to direct the forces of 
change guided by american values 
after a full week of deliberations the platform committee on 
friday fitted the last planks in place in the conservative document 
that lays out the bush agenda for the future 
were a conservative political party said republican party 
chief frank j fahrenkopf were proud of that were not afraid 
of the c word 
if the conservatives were happy with the final form readied for 
the convention next week the partys moderates said they were not 
running away 
we feel this is a progressive platform said gov john 
mckernan of maine 
there are some things in this platform i do not like said 
rep jan meyers of kansas but conservatives and moderates in the 
republican party can run on it and not from it 
and there were no reports of anyone so unhappy with the platform 
as to be drafting a minority report to spark a floor fight next 
week 
but democrats who produced a 5000word thematic document at 
their convention in atlanta last month were quick to ridicule the 
gop platform 
the gop has cooked up a platform that is a version of 1980 and 
1984 warmedover broken promises said democratic party chief 
paul kirk once again the republicans are talking about the 
future through a rearview mirror 
theyre doing everything they can to avoid talking about their 
candidate and leadership said leslie dach communications 
director for democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
adding the document was a rightwing platform proudly mired in 
the past 
the long and often tedious platform work ended on a high note as 
committee chairman kay orr the nebraska governor unveiled her 
preamble that opens the document 
an election is about the future about change she read 
the election will bring change the question is will it be 
change and progress with the republicans or change and chaos with 
the democrats 
americans want leadership to direct the forces of change 
guided by american values she went on 
then she choked up briefly as she read the final sentences 
at the very heart of this platform is our belief that the 
strength of america is its people they are still eager to 
grasp the future to seize the chaos of experience and through 
faith and love and work to transfer it into the valuable the 
useful and the beautiful 
this is what the american people do quietly patiently 
without headlines as a nation of communities every day it is 
to them we dedicate this platform 
the 106member committee ended work friday and a final draft of 
the document will be released late today the final committee vote 
comes monday afternoon in preparation for the convention floor 
discussion tuesday 
fridays work was concentrated on foreign policy and defense 
areas where bush believes he has an advantage over dukakis 
there were some squabbles but most disputes were settled 
quietly such as the question of how quickly to deploy the strategic 
defense initiative 
language calling for rapid and certain deployment of the 
star wars missile defense system prevailed authored by 
conservatives led by angela bay buchanan of california the 
bush campaign simply said the language was fine though it was 
slightly firmer than the call for deployment as soon as feasible 
that the campaign had favored 
we were thrilled with the original language and were happy 
with where we are said new hampshire gov john sununu a bush 
representative on the committee youre arguing over nuances 
the bush campaign also added at the last minute a summary 
chapter on defense and foreign policy saying it grew out of a 
meeting three weeks ago with bush 
its a bush national security strategy document said 
charlie black the campaigns chief staffer on platform matters 
the original draft of the new chapter included no mention of 
sdi but it was added in a hurriedly called subcommittee meeting 
friday afternoon 
black and former sen john tower of texas both denied any 
significance to the omission 
despite the platforms conservative tone it was not strong 
enough on foreign policy for some of the committee members 
the russian bear hasnt changed theyve just dressed him up 
in a threepiece suit and gucci loafers said jim summers of 
washington 
the committee agreed to a strong statement denouncing south 
africas racial policies republicans deplore the apartheid 
system of south africa and consider it morally repugnant 
then a struggle erupted between the bush campaign and more 
militant committee members over how to describe the source of the 
troubles in that region of the world the platform already blamed 
marxist imperialism which actively supports the march of tyranny 
in africa 
bush forces firmly in control wanted no variations in 
carefully crafted language and turned back all major changes

president daniel ortega of nicaragua on 
friday offered to renew peace talks with ussupported rebels 
either in managua or washington 
ortega who is on an official visit to ecuador also criticized 
the us congress for approving new aid to the rebels and called it 
an act of aggression he demanded that such aid be stopped 
adolfo calero a rebel leader on friday rejected managua as the 
site for peace talks saying the climate doesnt exist for them 
to be held there he also demanded that ortega personally attend 
future talks 
in a separate meeting with reporters in quito cuban president 
fidel castro said he was willing to help bring a fair peace to 
central america 
on thursday costa rican president oscar arias who won the 1987 
nobel peace prize for his efforts to bring peace to central 
america said he asked castro for assistance in achieving that 
goal arias said at the time that nothing concrete had been 
achieved 
representatives of the leftwing sandinista government and the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras agreed on a ceasefire march 23 
under a regional peace plan that ortega and four other central 
american presidents signed in august 1987 
the ceasefire often has been violated but extended by both 
sides most recently by nicaragua unilaterally until aug 30 but 
the two sides have deadlocked on a permanent truce and have failed 
to agree on a site or date for talks since the last round ended 
june 9 
leaders of the contras said they would hold no further meetings 
in managua the nicaraguan capital the contras claimed the 
sandinistas refused to allow them freedom of movement 
we invite the contras to come to managua aug 2629 
ortega told a news conference 
we see no sense in having the meeting in another country he 
said the only place outside of managua that we would accept 
would be washington in washington it would be possible to achieve 
something because washington is part of the aggression against 
nicaragua 
on wednesday the us senate approved by a 4947 vote a 
democratic plan to provide 27 million in humanitarian assistance 
to the contras senate republicans who had sought military as well 
as humanitarian assistance voted against the proposal 
we are not going to managua because there we are treated like 
prisoners we would arrive in managua only to be in the hands of 
and to suffer the arbitrariness of the sandinista regime calero 
said in remarks broadcast by the rebels clandestine radio 
liberacion 
calero set a number of conditions before the rebels would return 
to the bargaining table including the reopening of the roman 
catholic station radio catolica and radio news programs shut down 
by the sandinistas in july 
calero also demanded the release of more than 40 opposition 
figures detained by the government when police violently broke up 
an antigovernment demonstration july 10 in nandaimes about 40 
miles south of managua 
president ortega also must be present at any future negotiating 
session calero said 
the peace plan which aims to negotiate an end to the 7yearold 
war in nicaragua as well as leftist guerrilla wars in el salvador 
and guatemala calls for ceasefires democratic reforms and an end 
to outside military assistance to rebels 
speaking with reporters friday castro said 
in truth whatever we might be able to do for a fair peace a 
peace with dignity we would always do 
but castro said no country should have to pay for peace by 
giving up its freedom 
peace does not depend on us peace depends on the 
aggressors he said it is much more correct to say peace 
depends on the policies that the united states follows not those 
that we follow 
us secretary of state george p shultz castro and arias were 
among those attending wednesdays inauguration of ecuadorian 
president rodrigo borga a moderate leftist who replaced leon 
febres cordero a conservative 
it was castros first trip to south america in 17 years the 
presidents of argentina uruguay colombia and venezuela also were 
present for the inauguration 
ortega arrived the day after the inauguration because febres 
cordero cut off diplomatic relations with nicaragua in 1985

the percentage of people using seat belts has 
almost quadrupled in the past five years but fewer than half the 
nations motorists buckle up according to the transportation 
department 
surveys in 19 cities showed that more than 43 percent of us 
motorists use the safety devices the department said attributing 
the major portion of the increase from 11 percent five years ago to 
mandatory seat belt use laws in many states 
a total of 32 states and the district of columbia require 
frontseat occupants of vehicles to wear seat belts 
increasingly public acceptance of safety belts is saving lives 
and preventing injuries transportation secretary jim burnley

belt use in 1987 
the 19city survey covered 49095 observations of motorists from 
february through may of this year it showed 434 percent of the 
frontseat occupants wore safety belts according to the 
departments national highway traffic safety administration 
similar surveys in 1982 showed belt use to be at about 11 
percent the agency said 
the survey indicated a wide range of seat belt use with 
motorists most likely to wear their belts in dallas 714 percent 
houston 656 percent and seattle 603 percent the cities with 
the lowest use rate were providence ri 154 percent 
fargomoorhead nd 217 percent and new york city 246 
percent 
belt use was sharply higher in cities where laws require 
motorists to use the belts the agency said it said that in 13 
cities in states with safety belt use laws belt use was 483 
percent while in six cities without such laws it was 304 percent 
here is the rate of belt usage in each of the 19 cities 
surveyed according to the highway safety agency

the lawyer for a middle east man jailed here 
as a material witness in the 1985 hijacking of a jordanian airliner 
says her client fears for the safety of his family in beirut 
mouin abdul ajam was arrested in california on thursday and 
brought here following a hearing before a federal magistrate in 
sacramento according to court records in that city authorities 
believe he could implicate fawaz younis a suspected lebanese 
terrorist in the hijacking 
ajam is extremely concerned that if he cooperates with the 
prosecutors in the case his family in beirut will be killed in 
retaliation by terrorist groups sympathetic to younis said jessica 
mcguire an assistant federal public defender who represented ajam 
in sacramento 
he has every reason to fear retaliation against his family in 
beirut she said ajam complained that the us government is 
not taking enough precautions regarding his family she said 
ms mcguire declined to give more information about her client 
citing his concerns for the safety of his family 
younis a former member of lebanons shiite amal militia was 
arrested last september after he was lured aboard an fbichartered 
yacht in the mediterranean is awaiting trial here on charges that 
he led the june 11 1985 hijacking of a royal jordanian airliner in 
beirut 
ajam was named in an arrest warrant outlining justice department 
concerns that he might not cooperate in the prosecution of younis 
ms mcguire said 
federal prosecutors here have also filed a motion to compel ajam 
to give a sworn deposition about the case said sources familiar 
with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity 
justice department spokesman john russell declined to comment 
federal prosecutors have jurisdiction to prosecute the younis 
case because the plane was carrying several americans no date has 
been set for younis trial in us district court here 
ajam is one of several middle easterners who prosecutors have 
said could give evidence against younis 
prosecutors disclosed in court last month that two airline crew 
members are in protective custody after agreeing to come to this 
country and testify against younis 
us magistrate esther mix in sacramento ordered ajam detained 
and us district judge barrington d parker who issued the 
warrant for ajams arrest has scheduled a bail hearing on monday 
the royal jordanian airliner was hijacked at the beirut airport 
by four armed men and forced to fly to several locations in the 
mediterranean following its return to beirut the next day the 
jetliner was blown up after 74 passengers and crew members were 
taken off the aircraft 
the trial is being delayed while prosecutors appeal parkers 
ruling that the fbi illegally obtained statements from younis 
during a fourday interrogation following his arrest at sea the 
judge ruled the admissions couldnt be used as evidence against 
younis because the defendant didnt understand his constitutional 
protection against selfincrimination

presidential campaign trail 
 
president reagan at a spirited preconvention sendoff for 
george bush i suspect most people will vote for george bush this 
year because after voting for him once or twice before they know 
hes their guarantee that peace and prosperity today will be 
followed by peace and prosperity tomorrow and frankly i dont 
think the american people want to gamble their future on a blind 
date 
 
george bush assailing democrats while hailing reagan we all 
know what will kill definitively kill this economic expansion 
weve worked so hard to create those same democrats the mcgovern 
or carter or mondale democrats are just itching to get their hands 
back on the levers that you operate so ably 
 
illinois gov james r thompson said to be on the list of 
republican vice presidential possibilities asking that his name be 
withdrawn from consideration the vice presidents job requires a 
lot of national and international travel my wife couldnt travel

coral reefs contain a wealth of 
information on climate changes that occurred centuries ago and 
could help predict the worlds weather scientists say 
about 750 scientists from 53 nations attended a symposium on 
coral reefs that ended friday 
they also discussed the fate of coral reefs attacked by 
crownofthorns starfish that devour living coral most of the 
participants believed the reefs recover quickly but others said 
the reefs could be dead for centuries 
the most important thing to come out of the conference was the 
recognition that coral reefs are the repositories of a wealth of 
data going back millions of years said peter davies chairman of 
the symposium at james cook university 
the university is a few miles from a section of the 
1200milelong great barrier reef off australias northeastern 
coastline 
reefs have got all the data on sealevel change weather 
climate the greenhouse effect davies said 
scientists use the term greenhouse effect to refer to 
pollution that accummulates in the atmosphere and traps energy from 
the sun causing the earths temperature to rise 
davies said that scientists using such techniques as drilling 
core samples of living corals of great age could measure old 
climatic changes 
the information in the corals will let us make sensible 
predictions he said they are like a huge library it was 
reported here for the first time that we are seeing the same or 
similar structures in old corals in the sinai desert as we see in 
living corals now 
and those corals in the sinai were uplifted and exposed into 
what is now arid land 250000 years ago 
davies also said scientists are studying the biochemistry of 
corals in search of a substance that could protect humans from 
sunburn 
corals in shallow water produce a natural suncreen if they 
didnt theyd die of sunburn davies said and the research has 
a large potential 
crownofthorn starfish are found throughout the world but 
periodically they appear in vast numbers in parts of the great 
barrier reef and may destroy up to 90 percent of the coral on a 
reef 
scientists said it has not been determined why the starfish 
appear when they do and there is no known method of controlling 
them 
davies said most evidence indicates the starfish are part of the 
reef cycle and the reefs quickly recover 
but robert endean a professor at the university of queensland 
told the conference it would take centuries for large corals to 
recover and then only if the starfish did not return while they 
were regrowing 
australian scientists said they had tried injecting the starfish 
with copper sulphate catching them by hand installing underwater 
wire fences and infecting them with bacteria but nothing worked 
the scientists were told the australian armed forces once sent 
divers to kill the starfish but the cost came to about 20 per 
dead fish

gen manuel antonio noriega marked 
his fifth anniversary as panamas military leader by delivering a 
diatribe against the united states which has tried to oust him 
from power 
noriega head of panamas defense forces said the reagan 
administration created a false crisis in an attempt to revoke the 
1977 panama canal treaties which turn over control of the vital 
waterway to panama on dec 31 1999 
the united states is using lies falsehoods and politics to 
keep north american youth in military service in panama under 
the risk of war that their government is provoking he declared 
friday 
many panamanians wrongly thought panama and the united 
states were beginning a permanent honeymoon forgetting that for 
the united states a treaty is no more than a useful but 
emphemeral act the united states signs treaties knowing that it is 
going to violate them he said 
about 12000 us military personnel are based in panama to 
protect the canal the headquarters of the us southern command 
which directs all american military activities in central and south 
america also is in panama 
noriega spoke before an audience of thousands of government 
officials supporters soldiers and civilian militia at an old 
section of albrook air force base that has been taken over by 
panama under the canal treaties 
the general began his speech by waving his fist toward the us 
command headquarters nearby and saying welcome to the territory 
of panama in the canal zone welcome until you march 
noriega chief of the defense forces and the power behind the 
civilian government is under federal indictment in the united 
states on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering 
washington has sought his ouster since early this year applying 
economic sanctions that have helped push panama into its worst 
depression since the 1930s 
the general who took command of the panama defense forces on 
aug 12 1983 has refused to bow to us and internal pressure for 
his resignation and departure

an attorney and an author presented a 
packed auditorium friday with two sworn affidavits indicating a 
babysitter confessed to poisoning seven children and that their 
imprisoned stepfather is innocent 
the statements presented by attorney john robinson and author 
mark lane are part of an effort to win a new trial for james joseph 
richardson 52 who has served more 20 years of a life sentence for 
poisoning his eldest child with the insecticide parathion 
the affidavits from belinda romeo and doris harris workers at 
the hardee manor nursing home in wachula said bessie reece 
admitted the 1967 murders of the children age 2 to 8 
ms romeo claims to have cared for ms reece from january 1985 
to last year at the nursing home 
according to ms romeos affidavit ms reece said yes i 
killed those children i killed them but i dont know why 
i was certain she understood my question ms romeo said in 
the statement 
ms reece now 67 was a neighbor of richardsons in arcadia at 
the time the children were slain ms reece had been on parole from 
a sentence for killing her husband 
more than 20 years after the killings the case still holds 
enough interest here that residents filled the auditorium of the 
community center a former elementary school 
robinson defended richardson at a highly publicized fourday 
murder trial in 1968 in which prosecutors claimed richardson 
sprinkled the insecticide on the childrens lunch of hog jowl and 
beans richardson was charged with all seven deaths but was 
convicted only in the death of his oldest stepdaughter charges 
were dropped against his wife 
investigators charged that richardson intended to collect 1000 
in life insurance on each child from a policy that he had tried to 
buy but had not paid for from a traveling salesman on the night 
before the mass murder 
the statements of guilt attributed to ms reece were said to 
have been made after she entered the nursing home but before state 
officials deemed her mentally incompetent 
desoto county sheriff joe varnadore said through a department 
spokesman wednesday that he has reviewed the new evidence but 
hasnt decided whether to reopen the investigation 
richardson 52 is at the tomoka correctional institution in 
daytona beach where he is scheduled to become eligible for parole 
in 1993

paccar one of the countrys largest big truck 
manufacturers has recalled as many as 10000 peterbilt and 
kenworth trucks that may have defective powersteering gearboxes 
the bellevuebased company said the trucks subject to the recall 
were produced after march and range in value from 60000 to more 
than 100000 apiece 
paccar spokesman jack mcrae said the gearbox supplier ross gear 
division of trw asked paccar to suspend delivery of its topofthe 
line class 8 trucks because of potential defects mcrae said paccar 
and trw officials met friday to determine the precise problem and 
how to resolve it 
mcrae said the company planned to keep production going then 
store the trucks until the problem is isolated and fixed paccar 
produces more than 2000 of the trucks each month 
to the best of my knowledge this is the most significant 
recall weve had he said 
other makers also use the gearbox mcrae added 
no accidents or injuries have been reported mcrae said as soon 
as paccar found out about the problem it sent out messages to 
dealers urging them to tell owners of peterbilt and kenworth trucks 
built since march to pull them off the road the company said 
paccar issued a statement at the close of the business day 
thursday about the problem 
the stock market initially failed to take notice an hour into 
trading friday the stock was ahead 125 cents at 36875 a share 
after a dow jones news service headline on paccar appeared 75 
minutes into the trading day the stock quickly plunged four hours 
later about an hour before the market closed paccar had fallen to 
3350 a share on volume of 482000 shares in all of june paccar 
volume was 760700 
mcrae said based on what little the company knows about the 
problem so far it will not cause serious financial loss

the reagan administration will begin applying 
new regulations denying federal money to family planning clinics 
that give women information about abortions unless the clinics are 
covered by court injunctions barring enforcement of the rules 
a spokesman for several family planning groups said the decision 
was a political ploy timed to please conservatives before next 
weeks republican national convention 
as a practical matter the announcement friday by the department 
of health and human services will have no immediate impact since it 
applies only to new grant applications or renewals that come up 
after oct 1 
even then federal court orders in denver and boston forbid the 
rules from applying to the majority of clinics nationwide 
the justice department has appealed those rulings but they 
remain in effect pending further action that likely will reach the 
supreme court for final determination 
scott swirling head of the national family planning and 
reproductive health association said politics was behind the 
announcement 
this is simply a show before the republican convention to 
please the antiabortion constituency said swirling whose 
association is an umbrella group for most family planning 
organizations 
planned parenthood of america one of the plaintiffs in the 
suits that won the injunctions is a member of swirlings 
association 
the hhs announcement came after arthur b culvahouse jr 
counsel to president reagan sent hhs secretary otis r bowen a 
memo saying the regulations should be implemented in all 
jurisdictions in which injunctions are not in force 
the reagan administration has been stymied consistently by 
congress in persistent attempts to win legislative changes spelling 
out the rules it is attempting to implement administratively

of christ which opened friday in nine cities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at the bottom of the controversy is an intense utterly 
sincere frequently fascinating piece of art by a director for 
whom clearly the message of jesus life has immediacy and 
meaning the films greatest virtue may be its vision of jesus

it is without question one of the most serious literate 
complex and deeply felt religious films ever made brilliantly 
directed by martin scorsese this adaption of nikos kazantzakis 
novel will surely be discussed and dissected by both theological 
scholars and thoughtful moviegoers for years to come the 
temptation has nothing to do with carnal lust it is the 
temptation to be human moviegoers expecting the salacious thrill 
show trumpeted by the religious right are going to be very 
disappointed david ehrenstein in the los angeles herald 
examiner 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the provocative punishing weirdly brilliant adaptation of 
nikos kazantzakis novel has a feverish intensity it is a work 
of great seriousness by one of the countrys most gifted 
filmmakers there is also a substantial portion of hooey in it 
in willem dafoe scorsese shows us a christ who is more an 
anguished modern neurotic than a biblical figure a sort of hamlet 
and seemingly unfit for the role of messiah and he invites us to 
think of him as mad hal hinson in the washington post 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is clear that this is a noble if not totally successful 
attempt to wrestle with profound questions about the ageold 
conflict between personal satisfaction and higher ethical values 
there is nothing cinematically salacious or exploitative in the 
way scorsese presents two scenes involving mary magdalene judy 
stone in the san francisco chronicle

the controversy surrounding the last temptation of christ is 
much more interesting than the movie itself although emotionally 
charged at times the 2hour film drags leaving the impression of 
a project that aimed for epic proportions but came up short

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
perhaps no movie could live up to all the hoopla surrounding 
this one but last temptation is sad to say a pretty dull film 
its long and slow occasionally reaching hypnotic power in its 
images but more often lapsing into incoherence eventually its 
numbing in its effects deborah j kunk in the st paul pioneer 
press dispatch 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the movie does not even approach a truly radical 
interpretation of the life of christ it may well be one of the 
most doctrinaire visions of the life of christ to make it to 35mm 
film in modern times so much so that without all the controversy 
liberal critics might well have written it off as a sundayschool 
movie william arnold in the seattle postintelligencer

today at long last protesters and boycotters will have a 
chance to actually see the last temptation of christ what they 
will see is a film that has the effrontery to insist that christ 
was human but isnt that what christians have claimed all along 
it may be scorseses most courageous and it is technically 
superb but it is slow and at times heavy going mike mcgrady 
in new york newsday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the only thing sacrilegious about the last temptation of 
christ to my mind is its length a very long 2 hours and 40 
minutes the movie is in fact the drama of two men two 
polarities jesus and judas jesus the guiltridden nazareth 
carpenter whos always fleeing from and searching for god judas 
the hardheaded yet impassioned antiroman freedom fighter of the 
two judas is in this film by far the more interesting jerry 
tallmer in the new york post 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it may be the bible as kazantzakis interprets it but its 
also the bible without poetry the movie is long with tedious 
stretches during which youre more in danger of being bored than 
offended still scorsese has always listened to his own muse 
and here hes conducted his search for jesus in his own way hes 
done it with integrity reverence and a good deal of cinematic 
beauty chris chase in the new york daily news 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what emerges most memorably is the films sense of absolute 
conviction never more palpable than in the final fantasy sequence 
that removes jesus from the cross and creates for him the life of 
an ordinary man though this episode lasts longer than it should 
it finally has the mightily affirmative truly visceral impact 
for which the whole film clearly strives anyone who questions the 
sincerity or seriousness of what mr scorsese has attempted need 
only see the film to lay those doubts to rest janet maslin in 
the new york times 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the last temptation of christ is an admirably serious 
accomplished movie though it betrays little of the complicated 
texture and furious creativity of scorsese at his best david 
kehr in the chicago tribune 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
all of the uninformed protest will only serve to fuel

what has happened is that the princess has become the hottest 
piece of property in the country and thousands of people are 
coming to see it he said friday people are allowed to walk on 
a public dock 
my privacy is completely invaded said epstein who is 
docked four boats away from the princess people are literally 
sticking their heads into my boat 
trump has the marina security guards standing by his boat but 
they dont stop people from climbing on our boats 
trump in a lease agreement with the state invested 20 million 
to fix up the once deteriorated marina that faces his trump castle 
hotel casino 
it was falling down and now its the most beautiful marina in 
the world he said these people are unhappy because the rates 
will increase substantially commensurate with the quality of the 
marina

mayor sophie masloffs choice of a slogan for 
her city cleanup campaign sophies choice has certainly 
attracted attention but not of the kind she wanted 
the slogan brings to mind a william styron book and film of the 
same name which told the story of a polish woman in a world war ii 
concentration camp forced by the nazis to choose which of her two 
children would be killed 
i love sophie dearly i wish she had chosen another slogan by 
virtue of the fact it can raise an issue said richard marcovitz 
rabbi at congregation bnai israel 
i think it was in bad taste added councilwoman michelle 
madoff 
the mayor defended her choice thursday its just a catch 
phrase thats why i chose it not for any significance at all 
she said 
this sophies choice might not win an academy award but its 
my no 1 priority said mrs masloff 
the cleanup campaign includes new street sweeping machines 
more trash containers repaving 70 miles of city streets this year 
and cleaning every vacant city lot by october

a former navy gunner who says he saw 
george bush being shot down on a world war ii bombing run says his 
memory differs from the vice presidents recollection of what 
happened over the south pacific on sept 2 1944 
chester mierzejewski 68 a retired foreman of an aircraft 
factory said friday that he wonders whether the thennavy pilot 
and soontobe republican presidential nominee could have saved 
two crewmates 
one of those who went down with the plane in the south pacific 
radioman john delaney was his friend mierzejewski said but he 
added he has no animosity toward bush and calls him a very 
nice guy 
the new york post which first reported his story said no one 
other than mierzejewski claims to have seen bushs plane be hit and 
go down mierzejewski held a news conference outside his home after 
his account appeared in the newspaper friday 
bush has spoken of the wartime downing in interviews and has 
recalled his combat record in campaign speeches 
mierzejewski said he witnessed the incident as a turret gunner 
in a plane ahead of bushs he said he only reluctantly agreed 
after being prodded by a neighbor to discuss the case in public 
he said he wrote bush in march to urge him to check with 
advisers and make sure his recollection of the event was factual 
but got no response 
i do not want to see your campaign hurt by statements you may 
make regarding all that occurred when your aircraft was hit he 
wrote saying he did not intend to dispute bush in public 
he did not accuse bush of purposely distorting what happened 
saying the passage of time sometimes affects memories and added 
that from what i have heard you state this may be the case 
regarding your recollections of being shot down 
bushs press office issued a statement thursday saying he has 
recounted the incident many times and to suggest that his account 
is inaccurate is absurd a telephone call friday seeking more 
comment was not returned 
mierzejewski attached to the same squadron as bush was a 
turret gunner in the squadron commanders plane during a 
tightformation bombing raid against a japanese radar installation 
in the south pacific 
bush has said the plane was in smoke and the wings were burning 
when he bailed out of his bomber leaving behind two crewmates 
presumed dead bush was picked up by a navy submarine 
mierzejewski said he was only about 100 feet from the plane bush 
was flying could see him in the cockpit and i saw him get hit 
as he got over the water and it began slowing down and losing 
altitude he bailed out 
while he said he saw an initial puff of smoke he said it 
quickly disappeared after that i didnt see any noticeable 
smoke and i saw no fire mierzejewski said 
he said he was very upset after the incident because he wondered 
why bush did not try to make a water landing which if successful 
would have given the crew about two minutes to escape 
if there was any doubt at all in his mind or any possibility 
at all that these kids were alive by attempting a water landing he 
could have saved the people in the plane he said 
mierzejewski said that a month after the downing he saw bush and 
that bush told him i knew those two were dead because i called 
the back room and there was no answer 
in a television interview last december bush said one of his 
crewmates had also apparently gotten out of the plane and that he 
believed the other man died inside the craft 
i felt i had to give him the benefit of the doubt about what 
happened until he kept changing his versions said mierzejewski 
an intelligence report on the loss of bushs plane reported that 
smoke and flame engulfed bushs engine according to the post 
it said the report was signed by the squadron commander douglas 
melvin and a nowdead intelligence officer melvin is hospitalized 
with parkinsons disease and could not be interviewed the post 
reported 
squadron members interviewed by the post disagreed about whether 
mierzejewski would have had the best view of bushs plane 
mierzejewski said he is an independent voter and has not decided 
whether to vote for bush for president larry herman a neighbor 
who arranged for mierzejewski to be interviewed by the post said 
he is a democrat but is not politically active theres nothing 
political about it said herman

honduras foreign minister accused 
the united states of shirking its responsibility in bringing peace 
to central america and he said the reagan administration should 
work with the soviet union on a plan to end the regions wars 
nicaraguas president daniel ortega offered friday to hold new 
peace talks with ussupported contra rebels either in managua or 
washington he said the government was ready to meet rebels in 
managua on aug 2629 
adolfo calero a rebel leader rejected managua as the site for 
talks but did not address the possibility of talks in washington 
he demanded that ortega attend any future negotiating sessions 
honduran foreign minister carlos lopez contreras said the united 
states and soviet unions backing of warring parties in central 
america threatens the security of his nation a key us ally 
the united states must assume responsibility as a 
negotiator he told the associated press in an interview friday 
there must be negotiations with the four central american 
democracies the united states with nicaragua and the united 
states with the soviet union 
his reference to democracies meant the usallied governments 
in guatemala el salvador costa rica and honduras 
contreras said washington should develop a central american 
demilitarization plan with the soviet union 
in el salvador the soviets support guerrillas of the 
marxistled farabundo marti national liberation front which has 
waged an insurgency since 1980 against the usbacked government 
there 
in nicaragua the united states has financed rebels known as 
contras since 1981 in an attempt to topple the leftist sandinista 
government which is backed by the soviet union 
hundreds of thousands of refugees have sought refuge from both 
wars in neighboring honduras and fighting occasionally has spilled 
over into the country in addition the contras have maintained 
base camps in honduras 
about 1000 nicaraguan rebels in recent weeks have crossed into 
honduras in search of food and supplies distributed by the us 
agency for international development they joined an estimated 
250000 nicaraguan and el salvadoran refugees already here 
contreras said he would rather see the contras fed along the 
border than roaming the interior they are armed he said 
the foreign minister said superpower military assistance to the 
regions rebels threatens his country 
every time the american congress approves aid for the contras 
the soviet union thinks it is justified in providing more to 
nicaragua contreras said 
the net result is that honduras politically socially 
economically and from the security point of view is worse off in 
1988 than we were in 1977 he said our main concern is 
security we need to reestablish the military equilibrium 
the us senate on wednesday approved 27 million in 
humanitarian aid for the contras with the possibility of 16 
million in military supplies later 
the honduran armed forces total about 25000 nicaraguas army 
numbers about 80000 and the salvadoran military totals more than 
50000 
honduras has allowed tens of thousands of american troops to 
stage military maneuvers in its territory 
us military and economic assistance to honduras increased from 
less than 10 million before 1979 to about 200 million in 1988 
the foreign minister said but he said the aid had not eased 
honduran security concerns 
we allow the military maneuvers they practice and they leave 
and honduras stays the same contreras said on the other hand 
the soviet goods come to nicaragua and stay 
in remarks broadcast by the rebels clandestine radio 
liberacion calero set a number of conditions before the contras 
would return to the bargaining table including the reopening of 
nicaraguas roman catholic station radio catolica and radio news 
programs shut down by the sandinistas in july 
calero also demanded the release of more than 40 jailed 
opposition figures he rejected the idea of holding peace talks in 
managua but he did not mention ortegas suggestion that they could 
be held in washington 
ortega called for renewed talks while on an official visit to 
ecuador he also criticized the us congress for approving new aid 
to the rebels calling it an act of aggression

rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government fled a provincial stronghold for honduras 
where the us government is feeding hundreds of refugees from the 
nearly 7yearold war 
col enrique bermudez one of seven members of the contra 
directorate said 25 fighters and 750 civilian supporters trekked 
from central chontales province for a month and crossed the steep 
mountains and the coco river separating honduras and nicaragua 
he said thursday night the exodus happened because we cant 
feed the people there and added its better for them to leave 
because the sandinistas would harass them we protect those 
people 
visitors ferried to the hondurannicaraguan border by the us 
agency for international development or aid quoted some of the 
nicaraguan refugees as saying contra leaders ordered them to leave 
us embassy spokeswoman anne sigmund said aid was providing 
food to about 300 refugees thats the number we know crossed we 
understand more are coming she said 
cia supply flights to the contras inside nicaragua ended feb 
29 when a us military assistance package ran out the honduran 
government granted permission for the aid supplies to be 
distributed to the refugees 
contras and sandinistas estimated earlier this year that about 
3500 contra fighters were in chontales and receiving air drops of 
basic food and military supplies about 6500 rebels are believed 
to be along the honduran border seeking supplies from aid 
the contra leadership is asking for renewed military aid from 
washington saying peace negotiations with the sandinistas are 
deadlocked the senate on wednesday approved 27 million in 
humanitarian aid 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega on an official visit to 
ecuador on friday called approval of the aid package an act of 
aggression and proposed new peace talks with the rebels be held 
aug 2629 
adolfo calero a rebel leader on friday rejected managua as the 
site for peace talks and demanded ortega personally attend any 
future negotiating sessions 
the contras and the sandinistas signed a ceasefire pact march 
23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the civil war peace talks 
broke down june 9 and a unilateral government extension of the 
ceasefire ends aug 30

michael dukakis today began a weekend away 
from the campaign trail as he unveiled his first television 
advertising for the general election in highstakes texas and 
california 
the democratic presidential nominee traveled to cape cod friday 
night after campaign stops in virginia and florida where he 
denounced reagan administration antidrug efforts defense 
priorities and economic policies 
the new ad to air this weekend in the two states expected to be 
critical in the november election is part of an effort by the 
dukakis staff to raise the candidates profile in advance of next 
weeks republican convention 
on friday the economy was at the top of the nominees agenda 
with dukakis saying reagans deficit spending is responsible for 
the news friday that inflation was picking up steam and for an 
increase this week in interest rates 
dukakis in jacksonville fla told a waterfront rally the 
increase in the prime rate to 10 percent was the consequence of 
eight years of not paying our bills its an irresponsibility 
tax 
we deserve an explanation from the republicans at that 
convention about what theyre doing to the american people he 
said 
the massachusetts governor said the next president will have to 
deal with the deficit immediately if interest rates are to drop he 
stood by his promise to raise taxes only as a last resort after 
making spending cuts trying to increase the rate of economic 
growth and collecting unpaid taxes 
dukakis said a higher prime rate would impose unfair hardships 
on american families farmers and businesses and increase the 
federal deficit by 15 billion because of higher interest on the 
us debt 
as we all know sooner or later the bill collector comes to 
the door dukakis told a breakfast rally in richmond va before 
heading to florida 
the ad being broadcast this weekend is the first new spot the 
dukakis campaign has aired since the candidate was nominated last 
month in atlanta 
the airing is in states shaping up as two major battlegrounds 
for dukakis and vice president george bush california leads the 
nation with 47 electoral votes and texas has 29 
the 60second piece features several clips of dukakis 
acceptance speech at the democratic convention and credits dukakis 
with helping create more than 400000 jobs in massachusetts 
it wasnt a miracle the narrator says it was 
leadership

of los angeles san francisco san diego sacramento and fresno 
dukakis also will campaign during the final days of the 
republican convention with stops tentatively scheduled in florida 
minnesota illinois missouri arkansas and texas 
he was introduced by gov gerald baliles who said he disagreed 
with dukakis promise to scrap plans for two supercarrier task 
forces which would be built at the newport news va shipyard 
governor dukakis and i may debate the individual choices we 
must make but in his commitment to the security of this nation i 
have no doubts no reservations and no hesitations baliles said

democratic lawmakers say departing attorney 
general edwin meese iiis order calling for independent counsels to 
investigate members of congress suspected of criminal conduct is 
unnecessary and vindictive 
meese in his final act friday after 3 controversial years at 
the justice department said he wanted to ensure that legislators 
and top executive branch officials be treated equally under the law 
but legislators pointed out that meese has established a system 
with crucial differences for members of congress 
sen carl levin dmich said meese had a good idea but he 
messed it up by stipulating that the attorney general not a 
court would appoint the independent counsel 
its fine to have special independent counsels prosecute 
members of congress in fact that option is available now said 
levin but attorneys general ought to be able to use 
courtappointed counsels and local us attorneys it is that 
authority meese has attempted to eliminate today 
meese who has been the subject of two separate investigations 
by independent counsels since he came to washington as counselor to 
president reagan in 1981 said his action was not meant as a 
parting shot at his critics in congress 
instead he said having all high officials covered by the 
same general procedures makes good sense 
top officials of the executive branch are covered by the 1978 
ethics in government act which was designed to prevent any 
conflict of interest charges in investigations of highranking 
government employees 
members of congress are not included specifically in the law 
under which a threejudge panel names the independent counsel after 
a preliminary investigation by the justice department 
under meeses order if the attorney general receives specific 
and credible information indicating that a senator or congressman 
has violated criminal law he must launch a preliminary 
investigation of up to 90 days 
based on the results of the preliminary probe the attorney 
general either can close the case or appoint an independent counsel 
to investigate the court would not make the appointment under 
meeses order 
a justice department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the order would require the attorney general to 
follow these procedures if allegations were made against a 
legislator but meese said that if the legislator was the subject 
of a related criminal probe that could take precedence 
rep barney frank dmass chairman of a house judiciary 
subcommittee that reviews the ethics law said meeses order was 
unnecessary because the act already allows the attorney general to 
call for a special prosecutor 
frank said the order signed after congress had recessed until 
after labor day was a vindictive and petty act by a man who has 
not shown any class since he came here one last mark of 
irresponsible bitterness of a guy who messed up 
meese said his authority to impose the rule derived from the 
attorney generals power to appoint special prosecutors as was 
done in the watergate scandal 
he said he waited to sign the order until his successor former 
pennsylvania gov richard l thornburgh was approved by the senate 
on thursday so as not to cause thornburgh any problems at his 
confirmation hearings 
meese said he discussed the regulation with thornburgh and i 
believe he agrees with it thornburgh who was sworn in at the 
white house on friday could rescind the rule at any time 
earlier in the administration meese sought to have the ethics 
act declared unconstitutional but the supreme court upheld it june 
29 the justice department argued the law usurps powers granted the 
executive branch under the constitution 
meese 56 is leaving the government to serve as a distinguished 
fellow at the heritage foundation a conservative washington think 
tank and at the hoover institution at stanford university in 
california he also intends to hit the lecture circuit 
while at the white house meese was investigated by independent 
counsel jacob stein on allegations that he may have used his office 
for personal gain stein brought no charges against meese 
more recently independent counsel james mckay investigated 
meese on allegations of conflict of interest and looked into his 
relationship with e robert wallach a lawyer who has been indicted 
in a case involving wedtech corp a defense contractor in the 
bronx ny 
mckay said last month that prosecution of meese was unwarranted 
although the attorney general probably violated tax and 
conflictofinterest laws meese harshly criticized mckays 
comments and said the special counsels report vindicated him

us officials say the reagan administration 
will not replace the ambassador who was expelled by nicaraguan 
authorities but instead plans to send kenneth skoug head of the 
state departments office of cuban affairs to run the embassy 
as embassy charge daffairs skoug would not require senate 
confirmation to replace ambassador richard melton one of eight 
us envoys expelled from managua last month 
the state department said friday that nicaragua is withholding 
approval of the names the us has submitted as replacements for 
the diplomats who were ordered from the country 
department officials said refusal to approve the envoys 
apparently was in retaliation for the us expulsion of nicaraguan 
ambassador carlos tunnermann who served as chief envoy to both the

heavy rains lashed this desert capital 
today exacerbating flooding that left 15 million people homeless 
and hampering efforts to distribute emergency supplies 
the rains began about midnight and created huge pools of water 
in the streets of downtown khartoum a city of 4 million the 
airport was closed and the nile was rising the downpour continued 
through the night 
relief agencies and donor nations began airlifting blankets 
tents food medical and other supplies to khartoum on friday 48 
hours after a storm dumped six times as much rain on the city as it 
received in all of 1987 
but residents of some settlements say they havent received any 
aid and are desperate 
life was slowly returning to normal in some parts of khartoum 
but high water and poor management prevented distribution of relief 
supplies to hardhit areas the akhbar elyom newspaper a weekly 
in cairo egypt reported today 
the cairo daily newspaper alahram said hundreds of tons of 
supplies were in khartoum waiting to be distributed 
the rains that swamped khartoum and other cities in eastern and 
northern sudan killed at least 39 people and caused 200 million in 
damage maj gen elfateh abdoun a city official was quoted as 
saying by akhbar elyom 
some of those hardest hit are nearly 1 million people who fled 
drought and civil war in sudans rural areas to seek refuge in 
squatter settlements ringing khartoum 
one such settlement marzouk was reduced to a sprawling 
collection of crumbling walls and collapsed hovels 
residents of marzouk west of khartoum across the blue nile a 
major tributary of the nile said they had seen little aid 
we need tents and plastic sheets said abdullahim idris 
kody 32 he said his family had slept in the open air since the 
floods destroyed his tworoom hut 
he said they had received no food or medicine and that children 
in marzouk were beginning to develop intestinal problems and coughs 
sudanese officials have warned that the country could be further 
endangered by the annual flooding of the nile river in the coming 
weeks 
more than 83000 houses have been destroyed in khartoum leaving 
more than 15 million people homeless the egyptian middle east 
news agency reported many residents have been without electricity 
and fresh drinking water 
journalists touring marzouk encountered no one who had received 
any emergency aid and saw no substantial relief operation for the 
settlements 15000 people 
several soldiers stood outside six orange army tents where a 
young woman said she was handing out less than a 22 pounds of 
wheat flour per family daily in addition to supplementary foods 
that included sardines dates and sugar 
but no distribution was under way and residents complained the 
rations were being distributed along political lines only to 
special families not the camp as a whole 
information about the scope of the relief operation throughout 
khartoum was scarce and it was not possible to determine 
immediately whether the situation at marzouk was typical of other 
settlements 
prime minister sadek mahdis government has tried to discourage 
the settlements by denying them social services and forbidding them 
to dig wells 
abdul mohammed of the sudan council of churches said local 
nongovernmental organizations were trying to care for the 
displaced people but lacked staff and supplies 
most of the assistance received so far has come primarily from 
arab nations in the form of governmenttogovernment aid 
on friday however western deliveries began to pick up with the 
arrival of dutch american and unicef cargo planes carrying 
supplies earmarked for nongovernmental agencies such as the sudan 
council of churches 
but mohammed said those groups could handle only 15 percent of 
the displaced populations needs and would be able to help only the 
most desperate 
western donor countries concerned about the distribution of the 
relief aid met friday under un auspices to draft a letter to the 
government reminding it of their need to be able to account for the 
aid 
the concern now is that the aid is getting through said 
bryan wannop the un emergency relief coordinator in khartoum 
cairo newspapers said friday that sudan state television had 
shown the prime minister touring floodhit areas in khartoum and 
then complaining that supplies were not reaching flood victims 
speedily and in sufficient quantities he laid the blame partly on 
lack of coordination among government agencies

amid the hills of rural pennsylvania 
where the holocausts horrors seem long ago and far away a polish 
parish is converting a church basement into a museum evoking the 
concentration camp where the saint of auschwitz died 47 years 
ago sunday 
i lived through the cruelties and atrocities of world war ii 
and i would like the people in this country to have some idea what 
transpired said stanislaw dziob 55 an engineer from krakow 
poland 
he and another visitor from poland are transforming the basement 
of st thomas roman catholic church into a museum made to look and 
feel like the concentration camp where st maximilian kolbe died 
while honoring all those killed by the nazis the museum 
spotlights the polish victims especially kolbe a franciscan friar 
who volunteered to die so a fellow prisoner at auschwitz might live 
the 47yearold priest no 16670 to his nazi torturers died by 
lethal injection on aug 14 1941 he was declared a saint by pope 
john paul ii on oct 10 1982 a week later a shrine to the saint 
was dedicated in the shadow of st thomas an anchor of this 
ethnic former coal mining town 50 miles south of pittsburgh 
so often in the united states people speak of the 
extermination of 6 million jews quite forgetting the extermination 
of millions of poles dziob said speaking softly in polish 
many of the jews killed by the nazis were poles as well 
busloads of roman catholics from pennsylvania and neighboring 
states most of them polishamericans regularly descend on the 
shrine a small stone structure topped with barbed wire and 
holding the ashes of holocaust victims 
many visitors are moved to tears when they hear the churchs 
pastor the rev lawrence hoppe tell of the supreme sacrifice made 
by the frail tubercular priest from zdunska wola poland 
even though it is incomplete visitors also can visit the 
museum its dedication is planned for aug 14 1989 unlike the 
shrine the museum is meant to reach beyond religion according to 
hoppe 
i see the shrine as a place to come and pray to develop some 
piety and some closer relationship with god said hoppe 54 who 
is of polish descent and translated for his polish visitors the 
museum i see as more intellectual academic 
built in six cubicles lining two walls of the dimly lit 
basement the museum is also more brutal to the senses to lessen 
the shock hoppe and others plan to increase the intensity of the 
exhibits over time 
we would not shock the public too much at once rather 
prepare them bring people into a theme of suffering a theme of 
the terribly horrendous effects of war said waclaw rybotycki 
42 an artist and architect at the academy of fine arts in krakow 
it is called the expo museum expo meaning to expose the 
cruelty of the nazis and has the blessing of francis gajowniczek 
86 the pole whose life was spared by kolbes martyrdom 
dziob and rybotycki who began planning the museum with hoppes 
predecessor arrived last month from poland 
they brought with them 70 items for a display depicting the life 
of st maximilian and the atrocities at auschwitz in poland the 
most notorious concentration camp they received help in compiling 
the collection from the national museum in krakow the museum at 
auschwitz and the franciscan community founded by kolbe in 1927 
outside warsaw 
the displays will include recreations of deathcamp cells 
photographs tombstoneshaped plaques an eternal flame and an oil 
painting by rybotycki showing st maximilian about to die 
edith stein a jewishborn carmelite nun from poland who died in 
1942 in auschwitzs gas chambers will be honored and there will 
be scenes from the nuremberg trials of nazi war criminals 
a stone wall of honor will commemorate us servicemen who 
liberated the concentration camps 
despite the despair the overriding theme of the museum is the 
struggle between good and evil and loves ultimate triumph over 
hate 
you cannot have peace unless you have justice said hoppe 
who hopes the museum and shrine through st maximilians example 
can help prevent world war iii world war iv and any future world

eating breakfast may be good for ones 
health but using a photo of a snoozing president reagan to make 
the point is risky business a fast food chain learned 
fullpage ads featuring the photo were pulled from five 
newspapers this week after the burgerville chain received dozens of 
calls from people who thought they made fun of reagan said pat 
klinger vice president of burgerville usas parent company 
holland inc 
the ads depicted the president with his eyes closed and wearing 
headphones the picture obtained from nbctv was taken when 
reagan was attending a meeting at bonn west germany 
you can usually tell when someone skips breakfast said the 
ads which extolled the nutritional benefits of a breakfast like 
those available at burgerville 
twentyfive calls was all it took said klinger who yanked the 
ad after a oneday run in the columbian in vancouver the oregonian 
in portland the salem ore statesmanjournal and the dalles 
ore chronicle 
klinger managed to stop the ad before it ran in the weekly 
monmouth ore sunenterprise 
burgerville with 31 outlets in oregon and washington often 
uses eyecatching advertisements to compete with national 
restaurant chains but klinger said there were limits to the 
attention he hoped to draw 
were not in the business of offending or upsetting people 
he said the ad became something we didnt intend it became a 
political ad and we pulled it 
ron rasmussen was one of those newspaper readers who got upset 
i was so mad i couldve spit bullets said the former clark 
county republican chairman it was extremely discourteous to our 
president to put that ad in im 58 and i could fall asleep in a 
meeting

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen is using a southern strategy a tour of south texas 
to help secure his regional standing especially among hispanics 
the texas senator flew here for a speech friday night then 
planned stops in kingsville laredo brownsville and houston before 
the weekend was over 
hispanic voters can tip the balance of power bentsen told 
1200 people friday night at a fundraising dinner for the 
southwest voter registration project a group which promotes 
greater political participation by hispanics 
the crowd chuckled when bentsen said i didnt come to san 
antonio to give a political speech he then made a pitch for 
himself and presidential nominee michael dukakis 
when you elect the right people you get the right policies 
he said i happen to believe that mike dukakis is the right man 
to be president of the united states 
bentsen made no mention in his speech of president reagans 
nomination earlier this week of lauro f cavazos of texas tech to 
become the new secretary of education 
but he told reporters he didnt think reagans move would win 
the hispanic vote for vice president george bush the certain gop 
nominee at next weeks republican convention in new orleans 
that was so apparent i dont think it will have any 
influence bentsen said as far as getting any political 
mileage out of it i dont think it will a threemonth appointment 
is not going to be that impressive to hispanics 
bentsen has said he received 90 percent of the hispanic vote in 
his last senate race in 1982 
hours before bentsen arrived in san antonio he began airing 
television ads sponsored by his campaign for reelection to the 
senate under texas law bentsen can seek both the vice presidency 
and reelection to his senate seat and he is doing just that 
the dukakis campaign was also putting ads on television in texas 
and california this weekend combined with bentsens campaign 
effort it amounted to unusually intense activity from the 
democrats on the eve of the republican convention 
texas is a real battleground thats obvious bentsen told 
reporters 
dukakis planned to join bentsen in texas late next week for some 
joint appearances including a spot at the ranch that belonged to 
the late president lyndon b johnson 
bentsen planned to stay in texas through next saturday except 
for a brief trip to little rock ark early in the week a stop in 
florida was scheduled on the way back to washington dc next 
saturday night

new research provides a possible explanation for 
one of the mysteries of aids how a few infected cells lead to the 
downfall of the bodys entire immune system 
the research also suggests serious obstacles may stand in the 
way of finding a vaccine to keep people from catching the aids 
virus 
i wouldnt say impossible but its very unlikely that one 
would be able to develop a successful vaccine said dr ellis l 
reinherz senior author of the study published in fridays issue of 
the journal cell 
the research conducted at the danafarber cancer institute in 
boston shows the aids virus may destroy defenses against disease 
by tricking the body into launching an attack against the healthy 
cells of the immune system 
dr anthony s fauci head of the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases called the research interesting 
important news 
its teaching us what we need to do to target our vaccine 
development he said its not really good news or bad news 
you have to learn whats going on before you can do anything 
the research conducted principally by robert f siliciano 
tested the t cells of people who had never been exposed to the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus 
t cells perform many duties in the bodys constant warfare 
against germs some hunt down infected cells and kill them while 
others churn out chemicals that help finetune the bodys immune 
response one type of regulator known as helper t cells is a 
primary target of the aids virus 
molecules called cd3 receptors are carried by t cells and serve 
as their eyes in the search for microscopic invaders the 
researchers found that everyone has a few t cells with cd3 
receptors capable of spotting the outer coat of the aids virus 
however the cells recognize only small chunks of this coat and 
the chunks vary widely 
as a result no single bit of the aids virus could serve as a 
vaccine for everyone 
when the t cells recognize a piece of virus as foreign they 
produce many copies of themselves these become constantly prowling 
watchdogs searching for this single fragment of virus if they see 
it again they quickly mount an attack and kill it 
however the aids virus rapidly mutates changing the chemical 
shape of its outer coat the researchers found that if there is 
even a minor change in the piece of coat that they look for the t 
cells will fail to recognize it as their foe 
reinherz said the new research suggests that the aids virus 
kills by sparking an attack by the body on its own blood cells 
the virus is powerfully attracted to another spot known as the 
cd4 receptor that is found on several kinds of cells throughout 
the body but is especially plentiful on helper t cells 
reinherz said that when the virus takes over a cell it often 
forces it to churn out pieces of virus coat but not entire viruses 
these pieces of coat are scooped up by other t cells which remain 
healthy and uninfected 
once one of these coatcarrying t cells recognizes a disease it 
is targeted for such as a herpes virus it springs to life at 
this point the innocent t cell gives the appearance of being 
infected with the aids virus even though it is not and other 
vigilant t cells swoop down and kill it 
in this way reinherz said the body loses its diseasefighting 
t cells at the precise moment it needs them resulting in severe 
immune suppression

a hitherto unknown relative of queen elizabeth ii 
has placed one foot out of obscurity claiming his father was the 
product of an illicit love affair between a dashing aristocrat and 
a ladyinwaiting a blueblood chronicler says 
the relative is a 49yearold engineer whose first name is 
anthony he lives with his wife and two teenage children in a 
modest threebedroom house in a suburb of manchester in northern 
england but thats all he wants the public to know 
anthony says he is the queens second cousin once removed and 
according to harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes 
peerage he is her closest illegitimate documented relative 
brooksbaker said anthonys grandfather was charles boweslyon 
a first cousin of the queens mother queen mother elizabeth 
anthony wants his family to be included in burkes peerage 
along with his noble ancestors brooksbaker said he wants his 
children to be received by the boweslyon family 
he stepped forward when burkes peerage known as the blueblood 
bible announced a year ago that it intended to begin listing the 
illegitimate offspring of nobility and royalty in future editions 
burkes peerage authenticated anthonys royal links through his 
birth certificate letters and photographs but respected his wish 
to remain anonymous 
anthony feared public recognition might destroy his familys 
quiet lifestyle and has asked to be listed as the unknown 
royal brooksbaker said 
britains tabloid newspapers have offered him up to 85000 for 
exclusive rights to his story but anthony has refused 
brooksbaker said 
he has refused all monies brooksbaker said he is an 
unbelievably shy man and is far from rich but he has no problems 
financially 
in 1908 boweslyon a second lieutenant in the british army 
fell passionately in love with this attractive woman who was a 
sort of companion to his aunt at the familys stately home 
ridley hall in northeast england brooksbaker said 
a year later they had a child and asked permission to marry 
but a marriage between somebody of that station and a 
ladyinwaiting was really out of the question he said 
boweslyon was sent to canada for three years to recover from 
this great love and the mother and child went to live at her 
familys home in cheshire in northwest england he said 
the child charles was registered as a lindsay the 
lieutenants mothers maiden surname 
brooksbaker said boweslyons love for the woman never faded 
and that he possibly planned to marry her but world war i 
intervened and he was killed in battle in france on oct 23 1914 
illegitimate children cannot claim their full share of an 
inheritance but the boweslyon family looked after the child 
brooksbaker said 
they paid for his schooling and when he turned 18 sent his 
mother 600 pounds then about 2700 in canadian railway stocks to 
help him set up in business 
that is one of the best examples i know of the aristocratic 
tradition of accepting illegitimacy in an understanding and 
christian way brooksbaker said 
charles later married and had a son anthony he ended up a 
shopkeeper in the english midlands where he died in 1976 
brooksbaker said the boweslyon family gathered friday to 
discuss anthonys claim to his past and theres no question about 
anyone denying it

long lines of curious filmgoers turned out to see the last 
temptation of christ in nine cities greatly outnumbering the 
protesters who denounced as sacrilegious the film that debuted in 
guarded theaters 
many movie patrons left soldout theaters friday wondering what 
all the fuss was about while others said protesters were trying to 
suppress free speech and religious toleration 
its just a movie and you cant really condone it or say 
anything about it until youve seen it said james aguiar 23 
one of hundreds of patrons who lined up around the block at new 
yorks ziegfeld theater 
about 500 wouldbe viewers were turned away from the 1000seat 
theater showing the movie in san francisco 
the film was released six weeks early by universal as the uproar 
mounted over its depiction of a jesus christ filled with selfdoubt 
and tempted to abandon his call as a savior to live as a mortal in 
the film christ resists this last temptation 
protesters have damned the film as sacrilege saying it portrays 
christ as a deranged and lustdriven human who while being 
crucified dreams he marries and has sex with mary magdalene and 
lives his life as an ordinary man 
some leaders from evangelical protestant roman catholic mormon 
and orthodox jewish groups called the film blasphemous sparking a 
demonstration thursday by 25000 opponents of the film in los 
angeles 
cardinal bernard law the roman catholic archbishop of boston 
urged catholics to boycott the film calling it morally offensive 
and repugnant to christian belief 
but tom burger communications director for the united methodist 
churchs west virginia conference called it a theological 
issue 
if christ was to know what it was like to be human i would 
like to think that he would be tempted with human temptations 
and burger added my faith is not threatened by a movie 
although the protests were peaceful uniformed security guards 
friday checked purses and bags of movie patrons in washington new 
york los angeles and toronto and guards also stood alongside the 
screen in new york and los angeles but no major disturbances were 
reported there was minor vandalism at the los angeles theater and 
an arrest for disorderly conduct in new york 
in los angeles universal president tom pollock said he was 
gratified by the audience response 
i didnt know what to expect until we had an audience that was 
not clergy or press pollock said they applauded and i applaud 
them 
the toronto audience included priests and divinity students 
canon garth bulmer of the anglican church agreed with other more 
liberal christians such as the episcopal bishop of new york that 
the film is provocative but not blasphemous 
i enjoyed it even though much was farfetched it does make 
you think a lot about jesus he said 
in chicago the rev nikitas lulias chancellor of the 
200000member chicagoarea greek orthodox diocese was among about 
50 protesters at the biograph theater 
we have called on our people to go with prayer in the hearts 
that god might anoint these individuals to stop showing the film 
said lulias 
but 24yearold james schatz of chicago said as he entered the 
soldout showing that he was puzzled by objections to the film 
based on the 1955 novel of the same name by nikos kazantzakis 
its based on a fictional book its a work of fiction i 
dont think martin scorsese meant to offend anyone 
scorsese raised as a roman catholic says the film he directed 
is an affirmation of faith to provoke people to think about jesus 
as a man confronting temptation 
a dozen fellow directors including warren beatty peter 
bogdanovich penny marshall james brooks and walter hill 
expressed support at a news conference friday in los angeles 
we owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided 
zealots the film now will be seen by a lot of curiosityseekers 
said john badham director of short circuit and wargames 
what is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the bill of 
rights 
the movie also opened in seattle minneapolis and montreal a 
universal spokesman said no decision has been made whether to add 
other cities next week

a liberal activist group is urging 
republicans to repudiate a comic book being touted by conservative 
evangelist jerry falwell that portrays michael dukakis as a 
supporter of witchcraft and bestiality 
falwell is urging his followers to paper the political landscape 
with copies of the 30page book titled magical mike the real 
story of mike dukakis among other things it depicts the 
democratic presidential nominee in a dress wig and pearls 
the last thing the bush campaign the republican party and the 
presidential campaign need is the distribution of 10 million copies 
of a comic book thats chock full of enough intolerance to offend 
just about everyone except jerry falwell john buchanan chairman 
of people for the american way said friday 
in washington dick hafer of lanham md the books producer 
said in an interview friday night that the material is all 
documented and the drawings are stylized to make a point 
i think its fair said hafer who calls himself the 
comics commando on the booklet i think it certainly has a 
point of view id say its accurate thats the most important 
thing he added 
hafer said he has done other comic books on political topics 
including one called every family has one during sen edward m 
kennedys 1982 reelection race depicting the massachusetts 
democrat as a black sheep 
in the dukakis comic the massachusetts governor is called 
sheriff pansy for his crimefighting record especially the 
states prison furlough program 
the book suggests that dukakis would ruin the nations defense 
system and describes him as an enemy of babies for his stand in 
favor of women being allowed to have abortions in one drawing 
dukakis is dressed in doctors garb holding the hose of a vacuum 
elsewhere a supporter is shown holding a sign that says the 
best baby is a dead baby 
falwell founder of the conservative moral majority displayed 
the book thursday night at a rally in advance of the monday start 
of the republican national convention 
samples of the booklet had been passed out before falwell spoke 
and he subsequently explained how he had been impressed with the 
artist who drew the comic book and purchased several thousand 
copies to bring with him to new orleans 
he urged the audience to buy some on their way out of the 
meeting and distribute them to everyone they knew 
i want to shoot the guys legs out from under him falwell 
said of dukakis i want to expose him this man is to the left of 
walter mondale george mcgovern and maybe to the left of soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
asked whether he agreed with falwells aim hafer said i 
would like to see people have a chance to get all this information 
in one spot i think people who have the facts can make a good 
decision 
one page in the comic book lists what it describes as bills 
dukakis filed in 1970 as a state representative including measures 
repealing a law punishing blasphemy the law against fornication 
and the law prohibiting the crime against nature either with 
mankind or with beast 
the book says dukakis appointed a priestess of witchcraft as 
the official witch of salem over the objections of the salem city 
council and questions whether the greek orthodox church is aware of 
this 
the book also suggests that dukakis panders to special interest 
at one point it shows him dressed as a woman with a wig dress and 
strand of pearls at another it has him riding the shoulders of 
jesse jackson

life terms in the 1981 assassination of president anwar sadat 
escaped from a maximumsecurity prison in a cairo suburb on july 17

was rearrested

an hour the extremists hurled stones and flaming objects and used 
chains against police who attacked with tear gas and sticks the 
police official said

vice president salvador laurel today 
accused president corazon aquino of incompetence and called for her 
to resign he threatened to quit the coalition government if she 
refuses 
in a fourpage letter to the president which he read to 
reporters laurel said mrs aquino was not adequately fighting the 
nations 19year communist insurgency and was allowing corruption 
on the scale of her deposed predecessor ferdinand marcos 
mrs aquino who took office in february 1986 accused laurel of 
not taking an active role in government and said at times he was 
more interested in playing golf than in attending important cabinet 
meetings 
madame president the time has come to tell our people with 
humility and candor that the presidency itself is the problem 
because the task requires a higher level of competence in the 
face of advancing communist insurgency the breakdown of law and 
order the resurgence of widespread corruption the paralyzation of 
the political will and the growing desperation of our people 
laurel said 
laurel accused mrs aquino of not consulting him on important 
issues and urged her to step down and call for an immediate 
election or i will have no choice but to forthwith dissociate 
myself from your government 
laurel told reporters later that he does not necessarily intend 
to quit his post 
this dissociation means i am quitting the coalition 
government i am not resigning as vice president of the republic 
he said he refused to say if he was forming an opposition group 
but sen juan ponce enrile the only opposition figure in the 
23member senate welcomed laurel to the opposition and said the 
two would meet soon to bring about a very strong and effective 
opposition in this country 
mrs aquino said later that the vice president had only himself 
to blame for the small role he played in government but she gave 
no direct response to laurels call for an election or for her to 
resign the next presidential election is scheduled for may 1992 
laurels political base has been eroding steadily since mrs 
aquinos election most of his backers in the philippine house of 
representatives have reportedly thrown their support to mrs aquino 
mrs aquino told reporters that when she called members of her 
cabinet to an urgent meeting during a november 1986 coup attempt 
laurel did not show up until late in the afternoon because he was 
playing golf 
can you imagine what would have happened if i waited for him 
while he played golf mrs aquino said 
mrs aquino said that during an aug 28 1987 coup attempt in 
which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded laurel never 
issued a statement of support for her 
the break between laurel and mrs aquino first surfaced in 
september 1987 when the vice president gave up his post as foreign 
secretary and announced he would no longer serve in the cabinet 
because of fundamental differences over the communist 
insurgency and other issues 
laurel who remained in the elected post of vice president 
accused mrs aquino of refusing to take his advice on critical 
issues 
laurel whose family had been among the countrys most 
influential renounced his candidacy for president against marcos 
in december 1985 and agreed to run for the second spot on the 
aquino ticket under pressure from the roman catholic hierachy and 
other opposition leaders 
mrs aquino ran under the banner of laurels united nationalist 
democratic organization or unido in the february 1986 elections 
that led to marcos ouster after 20 years in power 
since his break with the president in september last year 
laurels political fortunes have declined steadily his nephew 
benjamin laurel was defeated in january in the race for governor 
of batangas province the laurel family stronghold 
on friday the philippine daily globe reported that 21 of the 22 
unido members of the house of representatives had decided to bolt 
laurels party and join a proaquino alliance 
laurels charges followed renewed allegations of corruption and 
mismanagement in the government which came to power on the promise 
of reform 
the countrys solicitorgeneral francisco chavez has accused 
the presidential commission on good government formed to recover 
the billions marcos allegedly stole in office of rampant 
corruption 
on thursday mrs aquino fired the head of the governments food 
authority for incompetence after an investigation found widespread 
irregularities but cleared the chairman himself of criminal 
wrongdoing 
meanwhile communist urban guerrillas and rightwing death 
squads have stepped up street assassinations in manila and other 
major cities

an ohio law restricting the rights of females 
under 18 to have abortions was declared unconstitutional by a 
federal appeals court days after a similar minnesota law was upheld 
a threejudge 6th us circuit court of appeals panel on friday 
unanimously upheld a ruling by a us district judge in cleveland 
barring the state from enforcing the 1986 law 
it required that doctors performing abortions on unmarried women 
younger than 18 must notify the womens parents 
on monday the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st louis 
upheld a similar law in minnesota that law requires minors seeking 
abortions to notify both parents or get judicial permission 48 
hours before the procedure 
linda sogg a cleveland lawyer who argued against the ohio law 
praised fridays ruling 
it is a victory for all the parents who have wonderful 
relationships with their children who dont need laws to have 
communication ms sogg said i also think it is a 
constitutional victory of some great importance for young women 
for the privacy of their bodies and for adult women and their 
bodies 
roger evans a lawyer with the planned parenthood federation of 
america in new york city also hailed the ruling 
were glad that the court has upheld the rights of minor women 
to have constitutionally guaranteed services without imposing undue 
burdens evans said 
the appeals court cited the us supreme courts landmark 1973 
decision that a woman has a fundamental constitutional right to 
seek an abortion 
us district judge ann aldrich had found that portions of the 
ohio law were either unconstitutionally vague or infringed on the 
constitutional rights of females younger than 18 the judge 
objected to a specific requirement that the doctor must be the one 
to notify parents she said this placed an unfair burden on a young 
womans right of access to an abortion 
the judge also ruled that the ohio law fails to adequately 
protect a minor womans right to confidentiality in addition ms 
aldrich concluded that the law unfairly requires a minor who seeks 
court approval to have an abortion without parental notification to 
prove that she is sufficiently mature to make her own decision to 
undergo the procedure 
lawyers for the state had argued that the law is constitutional 
and appealed to the 6th circuit for permission to enforce it 
rita eppler an assistant ohio attorney general who argued the 
case for the state declined to comment friday on the appeals 
courts ruling until she sees it she refused to say if the state 
would appeal further 
the case began when the akron center for reproductive health 
two minor women and dr max pierre gaujean who performs abortions 
at the akron center filed suit to block enforcement of the law

radical students battled riot police 
in scattered clashes today in an effort to break through human 
barriers aimed at preventing a march to the border for talks with 
north korean students 
shopowners and residents near college campuses staged 
demonstrations urging students to halt unrest which they said hurts 
business and would mar next months olympic games in the capital 
a senior government official said the government was considering 
a grave decision this fall to protect the nation from leftist 
forces newspapers and political analyists interpreted the remarks 
as suggesting a crackdown on dissent after the games 
about 1000 students sneaked onto yonsei university campus 
despite human barricades set up by thousands of riot police around 
the campus in an effort to block student gatherings students 
hurled hundreds of firebombs in a series of attacks around the 
campus but failed to break the police blockade 
dozens of policemen in heavy riot gear were seen falling down 
after being hit by rocks sticks or iron pipes in continued battles 
along the fence police responded with barrages of tear gas 
police also drove back about 200 students who hurled firebombs 
and rocks in an effort to march from the myongdong roman catholic 
cathedral in downtown seoul 
at least 20 students were injured and about 200 were taken into 
police custody 
about 500 shopowners and residents around yonsei demonstrated 
between students and riot police at the gate they urged students 
not to cause unrest that hurts business and the olympic mood 
similar counterprotests were reported near the myongdong 
cathedral by some 100 people carrying placards in front of the 
korea university in eastern seoul and two other cities according 
to korean news agency yonhap 
the radicals claim that more than 7000 students across the 
country have volunteered to join a rally at yonsei that is to 
continue until monday when students plan to march to the border 
for reunification talks with their north korean counterparts 
north and south korean student representatives have called for a 
meeting in the border truce village of panmunjom on monday to mark 
the aug 15 anniversary of the liberation of the korean peninsula 
from japans colonial rule in 1945 
korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist 
south at the end of world war ii and the division deepened after a 
bloody war in 195053 radical south korean students a small but 
vocal minority are demanding reunification 
police bent on foiling disturbances before the sept 17oct 2 
olympics in seoul have enforced stringent security measures to 
block student marches and rallies advocating talks with north 
korean students 
police said they have been ordered to refrain from using tear 
gas as part of a government effort to maintain a festive olympic 
mood but the strategy has led to more injuries police said at 
least 120 students and policemen have been injured since wednesday 
kim yongkap the minister for government administration 
accused the students of seeking to disrupt the olympics and 
overthrow the government and said the government cannot but make 
a grave decision after the olympics if the current political 
situation continues 
a former military officer kim served as a senior intelligence 
official at the agency for national security planning formerly 
called the kcia under the authoritarian government of former 
president chun doohwan 
kim said the nation was at a crossroads where it would be 
communized like vietnam or prosper with democracy he said 
there has been an expansion of leftist forces aligning themselves 
with north korean propaganda 
at this point the protection of our democratic system is more 
important than the successful hosting of the olympics kim added

though needle drug abusers often change their 
practices when told of the risks of aids many still suffer immune 
system damage that may make it difficult to ward off the disease a 
study suggests 
researchers also confirmed friday that ones state of mind 
affects the immune system and suggested it may make a difference 
with aids 
the work was presented at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association 
the change in drug practices is significant because drug users 
are often thought not responsive to health warnings said 
researcher john watters 
his study done in san francisco found users cut back on the 
sharing of hypodermic needles which can spread the aids virus 
cleaned their needles more and increased their use of condoms 
during sex when told of the dangers 
we found dramatic changes after a program to educate drug 
users began in 1986 said watters of the urban health study in san 
francisco 
intravenous drug abuse is blamed for about 19 percent of the 
nations cumulative total of some 70000 cases of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
workers in the san francisco program told drug abusers about 
aids prevention measures distributed condoms and gave out bleach 
to disinfect needles 
researchers studied drug and condom practices of 386 drug users 
interviewed in 1986 before the program began and 545 users 
interviewed in early 1987 some eight months after the start of the 
program an additional 534 were sampled later in 1987 and 553 in 
early 1988 
use of safe needle hygiene rose from 13 percent of the time 
drugs were used before the outreach program to 63 percent 
afterward safe hygiene was defined as using bleach alcohol 
hydrogen peroxide or boiling water to disinfect needles or not 
sharing needles 
the followup surveys found hygiene used 70 percent of the time 
in late 1987 and 71 percent in early 1988 
the estimated number of sharing partners dropped from an average 
of 11 before the outreach program to eight in early 1987 with nine 
and five reported in the following two surveys 
condom use rose from 3 percent of the time before the outreach 
program to 16 percent afterwards with 23 percent in each of the 
followup surveys 
blood tests found that the rate of users exposed to the aids 
virus jumped from 6 percent in early 1986 to 13 percent in early 
1987 with 9 percent and 11 percent in the following two surveys 
james sorensen of the university of california san francisco 
who has studied aids prevention among drug users in treatment said 
watters results on behavioral change ring true 
but he warned we need to work very hard to reach people who 
havent been reached 
the study of drug users in treatment focused on 30 outpatients 
in a longterm methadone program none had been infected with the 
aids virus said nancy klimas of the university of miami school of 
medicine and the veterans administration medical center in miami 
but they showed significant deficiencies in the functioning of 
their diseasefighting immune system she said for example the 
functioning of their natural killer cells was about half of 
normal she said 
poor nutrition nonaids infections prior drug abuse or perhaps 
the methadone may be responsible but no cause has yet been found 
she said 
don des jarlais of the new york state division of substance 
abuse services said previous research has shown that immune 
abnormalities in drug users can take years to disappear once they 
enter methadone treatment 
klimas study also found that immune system function was better 
by several measures in abusers who showed greater hardiness 
defined as commitment to life a feeling of control and a tendency 
to see stresses as challenges 
loneliness and confusion were associated with poorer immune 
system performance she said but no causeandeffect conclusion 
can be drawn from any of the psychological data she cautioned 
another study released friday found that for homosexual men soon 
after aids infection immune system functioning was better in men 
determined to get on with life who focused on and expressed their 
emotions and who had a feeling of psychological robustness 
again no causeandeffect conclusions can yet be drawn said 
nancy blaney of the university of miami school of medicine

us attorney rudolph giuliani defended an 
assistants use of the word sleaze to describe outgoing 
attorney general edwin meese iii after meese called the comment 
firstyear law student stuff 
in his last day on the job friday after 3 controversial years 
at the justice department meese blasted giuliani and assistant 
us attorney edward little for the remark made by little during 
his closing arguments in the racketeering trial of us rep mario 
biaggi 
i think it was poor procedure and poor practice by any 
prosecutor meese said in washington and i think that any 
prosecutor who did that undermines his own case 
the trial which stemmed from scandals surrounding the 
bronxbased wedtech corp ended last week with convictions against 
biaggi and four others 
the defense had based its case in part on assertions that 
corrupt wedtech executives had connections to highranking reagan 
administration officials like meese and thus did not need the 
help of biaggi or his codefendants in securing government 
contracts 
however little called the meese defense a smokescreen 
surprising the courtroom by conceding meese is a sleaze while 
adding that that should not detract from the guilt or innocence of 
the defendants 
giuliani said littles words were as if they were my own 
near the end of the trial a special prosecutor in washington 
announced there was insufficient evidence to charge meese with any 
wrongdoing but he questioned his ethics on several issues meese 
announced his resignation after the report was completed saying it 
exonerated him 
giuliani said friday the sleaze comment was fully 
supported by the record in this case he added that he was 
ready to defend it anytime anywhere anyplace 
little said that had meese been a reputable attorney 
general we wouldnt have had to make that remark

fathers can help boys achieve higher educational 
development by providing social and emotional support in childhood 
but for daughters the key age for offering support is adolescence 
a new study suggests 
shooting a basketball on the court in the evening with your 
adolescent daughter has a positive effect on how far shell 
go in education said researcher john snarey 
but sons will benefit more from such activities as taking them 
trickortreating supporting their joining the boy scouts and 
spending time with them before bedtime all while the child is 
between ages 1 and 10 the study suggests 
the work was presented friday at the annual meeting of the 
american psychological association snarey a psychology professor 
at emory university in atlanta collaborated with anthony maier at 
northwestern university 
they looked at data on childrearing practices collected from 248 
workingclass white men in boston in a study that began some 40 
years ago then they compared that to the educational levels the 
fathers firstborn children went on to achieve by age 25 or older 
about half the children were daughters 
similar results have been reported before from studies done 
without such longterm followup snarey said 
specifically the researchers looked at how far above the 
parents education level the children eventually rose 
for girls that difference was accentuated when fathers had 
supported their physical development between ages 11 and 19 
through such activities as teaching them sports giving sex 
education and taking them to the dentist 
one possible explanation is that boys probably get help with 
physical development from other people such as coaches if the 
father doesnt provide it while girls often dont have alternative 
sources snarey said 
helpful activities for boys during childhood stressed 
socialemotional development such as rocking the infant to sleep 
and calming the boys fears of darkness 
activities to foster intellectual development did not appear to 
help boys or girls the study found 
researchers also looked at the eventual occupational levels of 
the children and found higher levels among females whose fathers 
had provided more socialemotional development during adolescence 
that included such activities as taking them to church spending 
time with them on weekends and providing guidance on dating 
problems 
no fathering activities were found to help the boys 
occupational levels 
the various analyses in the study took into account the 
education levels of the father and mother marital problems 
alcohol abuse number of children the fathers iq and his ways of 
coping with stress 
researchers cautioned that the fathers typically began their 
families during the 1950s and that other forces not addressed in 
the study are no doubt acting on fathers who started families since 
then 
in addition the sample included only white urban 
workingclass fathers so results may not apply in other 
populations reseachers said

the first significant 
rainfall since memorial day helped cool fires burning in nearly 
200000 acres of the nations oldest park and all roads hotels 
and campgrounds were open today 
in california the pilot of a us forest service plane was 
killed friday when his plane crashed while working a 1700acre 
fire in the sequoia national forest near bakersfield authorities 
said another firefighter died apparently of a heart attack 
battling a fastmoving wildfire in oregon 
fires also burned in idaho and montana 
yellowstone got about two hours of intermittent rain friday 
afternoon park spokeswoman joan anzelmo said 
one short rain shower is not adequate to douse the fires but 
it does help increase humidity in the air and it helps slow the 
fires down said anzelmo 
the temperature in yellowstone cooled down friday afternoon the 
wind slowed and firefighters made some progress she said 
the 40000acre north fork fire was the only blaze to grow 
friday increasing about 3000 acres the fire had caused the 
closing of the road from madison junction to old faithful on 
thursday but was reopened friday morning tourist activity in 
yellowstone remained high anzelmo said despite the fires 
we are continuing to see a very busy park with campgrounds and 
hotels each night she said but the last two days there have 
been fairly smoky conditions in the park and the vicinity so that 
has been difficult for everyone 
in montana cool cloudy weather slowed a 2800acre fire 
burning in the elkhorn mountains southeast of helena fire crews 
continued the slow work of building fire lines by hand in steep 
terrain officials said the cool weather also helped 125 
firefighters battling an 8000acre grass and range fire southeast 
of dillon 
firefighters contended with winds gusting up to 25 mph as they 
fought to control a fastmoving oregon wildfire that destroyed a 
mobile home and a refrigerated storage building near the community 
of mosier in the columbia river gorge 
in central wyoming on the wind river indian reservation 
officials said a 1000acre sagebrush grass and timber fire was 
more than 70 percent contained 
the lightningcaused fire began thursday and was expected to be 
controlled by sunday according to bureau of indian affairs 
officials about 50 to 60 firefighters were on the scene north of 
riverton 
idahos national forests have dropped their letburn policy 
on wilderness lands because of the drought and are sending hundreds 
of firefighters to spot fires caused by a second round of lightning 
storms 
a quarterinch of rain friday helped dampen the raging 
2600acre walker creek fire that threatened the town of inkom in 
southeastern idaho 
it was very significant in putting it down so we could work on 
it caribou national forest spokesman frank carroll said 
the fire acreage was revised from 4000 to about 2600 friday

the government today said it will 
expel argentinas consul within 30 days unless the south american 
country rescinds its expulsion order against a south african consul 
the threat was contained in a message minister of foreign 
affairs pik botha sent from vienna where he is holding a meeting 
on whether south africa will sign the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty 
botha said argentine consul hr basso will be given the same 
amount of time to leave the nation as south africas consul dirk 
de wet was given unless argentina reconsiders its expulsion order 
argentina earlier in the week ordered de wet and three other 
south africans out of the country for allegedly violating their 
visas the government said they asked to visit argentina for talks 
with the consul then participated in a prosouth africa seminar 
organized by the consulate 
the three men have already left argentina 
they are department of foreign affairs deputy chief director of 
communication planning gerrit olivier the deputy leader of the 
mixedrace house of parliament miley richards and black mayor 
bennet ndlazi of mamelodi 
botha said he had instructed his department to summon basso and 
tell him that argentinas action against de wet was unreasonable 
and unjustifiable 
if a south african representative abroad does not even have 
the right to invite guests to be briefed on south africa then such 
representation is meaningless said botha

iraq today called on arab countries to 
expel syria from the arab league for treacherous practices 
against the arab nation 
a proposal to expel syria would have to be considered during a 
league summit meeting because most arab countries maintain 
relations with syria it is unlikely iraq would prevail if such a 
proposal came to a vote 
first deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan also said the 
arab nations should end all dealings with the government of syrias 
president hafez assad 
the minimum arab leaders could do is expel the traitor assad 
from their fold and to boycott him ramadan wrote in an article 
in the governing baath party paper althawra to maintain 
contacts with him whether directly or indirectly means they are 
encouraging him and taking part in his crimes 
ramadan who is also a member of the governing revolution 
command council cited syrias policy in lebanon attacks on 
palestinian camps in beirut and its alliance with iraqs enemy 
iran syria sent 40000 troops into lebanon and west beirut to 
control fighting between rival militias among other reasons 
todays article contained iraqs strongest attack in recent 
memory on the syrian leader and came several days after iraq and 
iran accepted a unsponsored ceasefire in the gulf war 
scheduled to begin aug 20 
syria has been a staunch supporter of persian iran against arab 
iraq in the war which started in september 1980 attempts to 
reconcile baghdad and damascus over the last seven years have 
failed because of the deep mistrust built over the years between 
the governing parties in the two countries 
all major arab countries are members of the arab league with the 
exception of egypt whose membership was suspended after it signed 
the camp david accord with israel the leagues 21 members include 
saudi arabia morocco algeria tunisia libya lebanon and the 
palestine liberation organization

republican george bush days away from receiving his partys 
presidential nomination has narrowed his list of potential running 
mates an informed source said today democrat michael dukakis 
tagged bush a georgecomelately on the environment 
bush met friday with top advisers to discuss the decision on the 
no 2 spot on the gop ticket one participant in the meeting 
speaking only on condition of anonymity said the list now has been 
trimmed drastically from the original 16 names 
while the source declined to name all the individuals under 
consideration the list was believed to include senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas his wife former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole sen dan quayle of indiana sen alan 
simpson of wyoming sen pete domenici of new mexico and rep jack 
kemp of new york 
the source said at least one other individual was under active 
consideration but the adviser refused to identify the prospect 
meanwhile in new orleans where workmen and party officials were 
putting the final red white and blue touches on a convention 
designed as a show of the passing of control from president reagan 
to his designated successor the gop platform committee completed 
work on a 30000word document friday that described the election 
as a choice between change and progress with the republicans or 
change and chaos with the democrats 
the rival presidential candidates were out of the public eye 
after an active day of campaigning friday 
at the vice presidents residence in washington bush worked on 
his acceptance speech 
dukakis was spending a weekend at the beach after a fivestate 
campaign swing during which he blamed rising interest rates on 
reagan budget deficits and criticized bush as a latecomer on 
environmental issues 
the democratic nominee said he had opposed new offshore drilling 
for oil and gas and noted his efforts to block drilling off 
massachusetts 
im not a georgecomelately on this issue said dukakis 
the dukakis campaign also started broadcasting a television 
commercial in california and texas that touted his record as 
governor of massachusetts and said the states prosperity wasnt 
a miracle it was leadership 
republicans were arriving in new orleans by the planeload for a 
convention to celebrate reagans presidency and to proclaim bush 
his rightful successor 
reagan was to arrive in the convention city sunday and be the 
featured speaker monday night 
bush wont arrive in new orleans until tuesday the day before 
he will be nominated without opposition for president 
television evangelist pat robertson announced he would not have 
his name placed in nomination and would release his 93 delegates 
barbara gattullo an aide said that when robertson addresses 
the convention tuesday night he will call for unity 
a comic book accusing dukakis of supporting witchcraft and 
bestiality and portraying him wearing a dress wig and pearls came 
under fire friday from john buchanan chairman of people for the 
american way a liberal activist group who urged bush and the gop 
to repudiate 30page book 
buchanan said that the last thing the bush campaign the 
republican party and the presidential campaign need is the 
distribution of 10 million copies of a comic book thats chock full 
of enough intolerance to offend just about everyone except jerry 
falwell founder of the conservative moral majority who 
introduced the book at a rally thursday night 
elephants the traditional republican symbol were the animal of 
choice throughout the convention city gray elephants red white 
and blue elephants cuddly elephants and inflatable elephants even 
a giant elephant perched atop the hotel overlooking the superdome 
the enclosed stadium where the convention will take place 
workmen laid red white and blue strips of carpeting across the 
plaza between the hotel and the entrance to the superdome 
for bush the convention was an opportunity to cut the lead 
dukakis has held in opinion polls most recent surveys have said 
the democratic candidate was favored among likely voters by margins 
ranging from 7 to 14 percentage points 
but one new poll released friday by abc news said the race was 
statistically deadlocked with bush favored by 49 percent and 
dukakis by 46 percent a difference well within the 6point margin 
of error 
the convention rules committee approved changes that would allow 
governors and members of congress to be seated on the floor of the 
1992 convention 
rep robert dornan rcalif said it would be good to let the 
politicians be seated on the floor of the convention so they could 
rub elbows with the backbone of the party 
when the platform draft was completed gop leaders boasted that 
they unlike the democrats had come up with a document filled with 
substance 
we have michael dukakis the stealth candidate and the 
democratic party the stealth party former rep tom loeffler of 
texas told reporters were saying what were going to do

shops in burma reopened today and 
streets filled with people cheering the resignation of hardline 
leader sein lwin but some skirmishes were reported near rangoon 
travelers and news reports said 
burmas hitler was brought down by the might of all the 
people japans kyodo news agency quoted one burmese as saying 
it was late in coming but its only natural that the most 
unpopular person is overthrown said another 
brett b lambert an american student returning from rangoon 
said posters on walls of the capital showed sein lwin with blood 
flowing from his mouth a skull and crossbones around his face and 
massacre written beneath 
he said there were more cars on the streets today and shops 
opened their doors to streams of customers people are smiling 
and happy lambert said 
western diplomats contacted in rangoon said downtown areas were 
quiet 
were in a kind of wait and see mode the burmese are very 
relieved that sein lwin stepped down but basically skeptical about 
what it all means one of diplomat said is this cosmetic or is 
it a real concession to the demonstrators the diplomats spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
kyodo said troops had withdrawn from the city and tensions eased 
after four days of antigovernment protests that left at least 95 
people dead western diplomats said hundreds may have died in the 
fighting and unconfirmed reports said up to 1000 were killed 
during the disturbances rangoon a city of 35 million had been 
under a daytime curfew since tuesday 
peter swan an australian film maker returning from rangoon 
said in an interview that he visited the rangoon general hospital 
and saw more than 300 people wounded from the demonstrations 
news reports said students continued passing out leaflets today 
calling for protests to win democracy 
the diplomats said there were reports of minor skirmishes in the 
eastern suburb of okkalapa and unconfirmed reports of looting and 
shooting in the workingclass area where some of the fiercest 
fighting took place last week 
sein lwin stepped down friday after 17 days in power he quit 
amid reports that burmese soldiers were turning against the 
government and allowing people to march through some towns 
demanding democracy and economic reforms 
burmas official rangoon radio which announced the resignation 
gave no reason for it and did not say sein lwins successor would 
be 
lambert said that prior to the announcement of the resignation 
troops moved through rangoon in large numbers with armored 
personnel carriers 
after the radio broadcast the soldiers stationed around the 
hotel where he was staying withdrew but he said a number of 
burmese told him it was not over yet and that much depended on 
who would be sein lwins successor 
josef silverstein a leading american expert on burma said by 
telephone that a likely candidate was kyaw htin a relatively 
liberal military officer 
kyaw htin who received some military training in the united 
states has been no 3 in the government and party 
diplomats in rangoon said prices were soaring and food was 
running low with barely any transportation into the city from the 
countryside hospitals which normally function at threadbare 
levels were reported running seriously short of blood bandages 
and other vital medical supplies 
even if peace returns to burma economic recovery is expected to 
be slow and difficult once one of the worlds wealthiest nations 
burma is now listed as among the worlds poorest with a per capita 
income of less than 200 a year 
the economic problems were brought on by the isolationist 
policies of ne win who ruled burma for 26 years he resigned last 
month citing student unrest in march and june and sein lwin was 
elected his successor july 26 
students monks workers and other filled the streets of rangoon 
almost immediately demanding sein lwins ouster they blamed the 
former general for brutally crushing the march and june unrest and 
cited his bloody suppression of rangoon university riots after the 
1962 coup 
the protests spread to two dozen other cities on tuesday 
soldiers began firing into mobs of demonstrators 
reports from burma indicated security forces in at least two 
towns had sided with the protesters and a guerrilla leader waging 
his own war against the government called for a coordinated 
nationwide offensive

boys who were aggressive in elementary school but 
were taught to cope with anger showed significantly less alcohol 
and drug use three years later than untrained aggressive boys did 
a study has found 
their drug use was only a quarter of that reported by untrained 
boys and measures of marijuana and alcohol use generally ran about 
half of those for the untrained boys researcher john lochman said 
the treated boys showed improved selfesteem which may have 
removed one reason for using drugs lochman said they also had 
improved problemsolving skills which may have prepared them to 
make more careful less impulsive decisions about using drugs and 
alcohol he said 
lochman of duke university medical center in durham nc 
reported his results friday at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association 
its a very very promising piece of research said f 
daniel armstrong of the mailman center for child development in 
miami after the presentation 
previous work has found that high levels of childhood aggression 
can predict later substance abuse and antisocial behavior 
lochmans study involved 41 boys who had gone through an anger 
coping program between 1981 and 1984 after their teachers rated 
them highly aggressive and disruptive 
it also included 59 aggressive boys who had not gone through the 
training and 68 who had been rated nonaggressive by their teachers 
by the time of the followup study their average age was 149 
years the two groups of aggressive children were similar in racial 
composition achievement and levels of aggression and 
socioeconomic status at the time they were originally rated 
aggressive 
about 10 percent of boys in a typical elementary school 
classroom are aggressive lochman said in an interview 
they include not only bullies but also children who react 
aggressively to perceived slights from others they tend not to be 
assertive verbally relying too much instead on physical action he 
said 
the anger coping program focused on how to solve problems 
without physical aggression when faced with provoking situations 
with peers and teachers 
the weekly sessions were conducted during school hours with 
four to six boys at a time each boy attended for four to five 
months 
when followed up 25 to 35 years later boys who had gone 
through the treatment showed significantly less drug involvement 
fewer arguments with family or teachers because of alcohol and 
less alcohol drinking than untreated aggressive boys did they also 
tended to have less involvement with marijuana 
however the treatment made no difference at the followup time 
for classroom behavior problems and parental ratings of the childs 
aggression lochman said 
further analysis showed that a second dose of training which 
some of the children had gone through eased later behavioral 
problems pointing up the need for followup training lochman said

iraqis fired in the air and danced in the 
streets last week to celebrate a ceasefire in the war with iran 
signs that president saddam hussein has emerged from the eightyear 
conflict stronger than ever 
the 51yearold ruler a pragmatic populist utterly ruthless to 
his foes now can return to his dream of making oilrich iraq a 
modern economic and political power 
the struggle with iran was husseins war iraq invaded iran in 
september 1980 only a year after he came to power after border 
skirmishes 
on july 18 iran accepted a un ceasefire resolution that iraq 
accepted soon after it was passed a year ago the ceasefire is set 
to begin officially on aug 20 
iraqs staterun information services are doing all they can to 
declare victory hundreds of thousands of iraqis flooded the 
streets to dance and fire weapons responding to government calls 
to celebrate the day of peace and victory 
only 18 months ago iranian forces were pounding at the defenses 
of iraqs second city basra and foreign analysts suggested iraq 
might crack western newspapers suggested outsiders should topple 
hussein to fulfill iranian demands for halting the war 
instead the war seems to have ended in a string of iraqi 
victories over an iranian war machine drained by the costly attacks 
on basra 
hussein holds the loyalty of iraqs ethnically mixed population 
despite a war that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and hundreds 
of billions of dollars 
before the war the president already had a firm grip on power 
in iraq plagued by political instability for years before the 
baath party took control in 1968 
hussein quickly executed opponents within the leadership shortly 
after assuming power in 1979 and crushed proiranian religious 
fundamentalists in 1980 
mindful of numerous coups against past governments and perhaps 
his own past as an underground fighter hussein has used a huge 
security service to keep watch over dissent 
he also has promoted relatives to several key positions in the 
government and military although he has been quick to dump those 
who proved incompetent or disloyal 
the man who leads the iraqis must be of a quick and nimble 
pace hussein said in 1982 so the others will not step on his 
heels then his back then step on his head and pass him over 
hussein himself took part in an unsuccessful 1959 assassination 
attempt against thenpresident abdulkarim qassem 
the son of poor farmers hussein has combined an iron hand with 
a populist appeal he has a reputation for hard work bravery and 
personal honesty 
state television often spends a half hour or more showing the 
president sitting on a floor chatting with peasants or bouncing 
children on his knee the government has encouraged a cult of 
personality around him 
yet hussein told american researcher christine helms in 1982 
that after watching party members scrambling for power in the 
mid1960s i developed an aversion to power i began to 
loathe it 
husseins outlook was forged by his climb through the 
underground politics of the baath party which advocates arab 
unity socialist economics and rejection of foreign domination 
his policies are essentially pragmatic he told ms helms he 
did not think i had to be basically concerned with ideology 
until 1974 when he was already a senior force in the party 
hussein has gradually improved ties with the west and has 
demanded attention to profits and discipline in the countrys 
sluggish state enterprises 
he is also supremely selfconfident in 1964 still in his 20s 
he led a revolt against the old party leadership which was in 
disarray after being driven from power 
while in hiding i issued a communique on behalf of the 
partys provisional regional command which did not exist giving 
myself the authority to lead the party he told helms 
the war interrupted husseins massive effort to use iraqs oil 
wealth to make the country a modern power 
he has lost 10odd years of his rule in which he could have 
literally transformed the country said a senior diplomat in 
baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they have given a glimpse of the future to their masses and 
with the war over i think they will be in a hurry to start 
building he said

iraqi officials have created one of the 
worlds strongest personality cults around president saddam hussein 
massive murals and portraits of the president peer down over 
streets throughout the country television is dominated by songs in 
praise of the president or film of his visits to the countryside 
husseins photograph beams from the front page of every 
newspaper airports art galleries sports tournaments and literary 
prizes are named for him 
poets and singers often recite his praises for hours a day on 
the television 
even the eightyear war with iran was called saddams 
qadissiyeh a reference to the 7th century triumph of islamic 
armies in iraq over the persian predecessors of modern iran 
members of the ruling arab baath socialist party must take tests 
on the presidents works diplomats say criticism of the president 
can lead to prison 
hussein himself commented on the strength of this cult of 
personality in a 1983 interview with kuwaiti reporters in the 
interview published by iraqs state printing house he insisted he 
did not inspire the cult 
for seven years now i have been pressing them information 
media hard to slow down where the topic of saddam hussein is 
concerned he said they answer by saying that saddam hussein 
must be a symbol to all iraqis 
there are several religions sects and ethnic groups in iraq 
consequently our media have to take this factor into consideration 
and arrange matters in such a way that each of these groups has a 
share in the person of saddam hussein 
have you come across an iraqi child in a kindergarten or at 
school that does not mention the name of saddam hussein in the 
nursery rhyme or the school song he or she sings is there a poet 
with a poem that does not mention the name of saddam hussein x 
number of times have you heard of a peasant who does not mention 
the name of saddam hussein when mentioning the revolution he 
said in the interview 
you may speak to the iraqi women particularly those who are 
widows of martyrs they will tell you that their husbands have 
given their lives in honor of and in sacrifice to not the 
homeland but first to saddam hussein then the homeland and then

vice president salvador laurel on 
saturday accused president corazon aquinos government of 
corruption and incompetence and urged her to resign and call new 
elections 
in a fourpage letter to the president laurel said conditions 
in the philippines had gone from bad to worse since mrs aquino 
was swept to power in the 1986 civilianmilitary revolt that ousted 
president ferdinand marcos he said mrs aquino failed to curb 
corruption or stem the 19year communist rebellion 
laurel said that if mrs aquino resigned he would step down 
too but he said that if she refused to quit he would leave her 
coalition government while remaining vice president an elected 
post 
mrs aquino refused to comment on laurels resignation call but 
accused her vice president of withholding support for her during 
two major coup attempts 
last september laurel 59 quit as foreign secretary and 
refused to serve in the cabinet citing fundamental differences 
with mrs aquino 
since then the vice presidents political base has eroded 
steadily twentyone of the 22 members of his party in the house of 
representatives are reportedly preparing to defect to proaquino 
parties 
laurel read his letter to reporters at a news conference 
madame president the time has come to tell our people with 
humility and candor that the presidency itself is the problem 
because the task requires a higher level of competence in the 
face of the advancing communist insurgency the breakdown of law 
and order the resurgence of widespread corruption the 
paralyzation of political will and the growing desperation of our 
people 
we need a leadership that does not only preach boldly but 
sternly and courageously enforces public order and public morality 
without regard to the toll levied upon ones popularity 
laurel said that leadership you have promised but have failed 
to deliver to our people 
the next presidential elections are slated for may 1992 
laurels election call generated little support among political 
leaders 
sen juan ponce enrile the countrys chief opposition figure 
said he would meet laurel soon to forge a new alliance but he 
stopped short of endorsing another election 
sen ernesto maceda who has criticized some of mrs aquinos 
policies said he opposed laurels demand while the president 
has her deficiencies her stepping down will not solve our 
problems and may even compound them he said 
sen edgardo angara a conservative member of the aquino 
coalition said the country needs unity not new elections 
laurel a boyhood friend of mrs aquinos late husband benigno 
aquino jr accused the president of ignoring his advice and of 
breaking a promise to name him prime minister 
mrs aquino appointed laurel prime minister in 1986 but 
abolished the post soon afterward 
mrs aquino told reporters saturday that laurels influence had 
declined since she took office but she said laurel himself was to 
blame 
i would just like him to understand that when i need his 
support it seems he is not prepared to give it she said 
in a november 1986 coup attempt aquino said laurel was playing 
golf she said that in an august 1987 coup attempt in which at 
least 53 people were killed laurel withheld a public statement of 
support until military rebels were defeated 
laurel scion of one of the countrys most influential families 
announced his candidacy for president in the february 1986 election 
against marcos he withdrew and agreed to run for vice president 
after the roman catholic hierarchy and others told him only mrs 
aquino could unite the factious opposition 
mrs aquino ran under laurels unido banner marcos claimed 
victory in the balloting but fled into exile in hawaii after the 
uprising 
some of mrs aquinos supporters also say her government lacks 
direction and leadership 
last month the man who persuaded mrs aquino to run for 
president newspaper publisher joacquin roces said the government 
had lost sight of its goals of justice and social reform 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez has charged rampant 
corruption within the presidential commission on good government 
which mrs aquino organized to recover the billions of dollars 
marcos allegedly stole in office 
on thursday mrs aquino fired her national food director after 
an investigation found irregularities in his department but cleared 
him of wrongdoing 
communist rebels have expanded to most of the countrys 73 
provinces and urban guerrillas and rightwing death squads carry 
out street assassinations in manila and other major cities

windhoek southwest africa ap the people of africas last 
colony warweary and deeply skeptical after 22 years of fighting 
see major obstacles to independence despite south african proposals 
to withdraw 
south africa joined an angolan war ceasefire aug 8 said it 
will pull out of angola by sept 1 and tentatively plans to begin 
withdrawing nov 1 from neighboring southwest africa also known 
as namibia 
south africa has offered to grant namibia independence on june 1 
if cuba agrees to remove its 50000 troops from angola by then 
namibia has been ruled by germans and south africans for more 
than a century and most of its people are aching for peace and 
independence 
but they have had their hopes repeatedly raised and dashed ever 
since the un security council in 1978 passed resolution 435 
calling for namibian independence and unsupervised elections 
the words we are hearing today are the same words we heard 10 
years ago said danny tjongarero a spokesman for the legal 
poltical wing of the southwest africa peoples organization id 
like to be optimistic but south africa has proved ingenious in 
finding excuses to block namibian independence 
swapos outlawed guerrilla movement has been fighting since 1966 
to win independence for the mineralrich territory which is larger 
than france and west germany combined but has only 13 million 
residents swapo is considered likely to win independence elections 
due to its strong support in the north where most of the 
population is concentrated 
south africa calls swapo a terrorist organization intent on 
establishing a marxist state many namibians doubt south africas 
sincerity in proposing elections within a year that are likely to 
lead to swapo government 
south africa with backing from the united states argues that 
namibian independence must be linked with the cuban withdrawal from 
angola 
the cubans support angolas marxist government in the 
13yearold angolan war while the united states and south africa 
aid the unita rebel movement 
south africa cuba angola and us mediators plan to hold more 
talks the week of aug 22 in a bid to establish a date for the 
cuban withdrawal and independence for namibia without an 
agreement namibian independence plans appear headed for another 
derailment 
namibian leaders have been excluded from the peace talks and 
have been briefed by the south africans only after proposals and 
agreements have been announced 
we know all the participants in the talks still have tricks up 
their sleeve said andreas shipanga a black cabinet minister in 
namibias multiracial interim government established in 1985 to 
pave the road for independence 
asked if he thought namibia would be independent by june 1 
shipanga said id like to hope so but i dont believe so 
south africa has contributed to the skepticism by sending 
conflicting signals about its intentions in namibia 
south african president pw botha paid a rare visit to namibia 
in april and reiterated his governments commitment to white 
group rights which allow for ethnically based political 
structures and segregated schools and hospitals 
botha also extended the powers of louis pienaar the territorys 
appointed admistrator general most namibians condemned the actions 
and said they show south africa intends to maintain a firm grip on 
the territory it has administered since capturing it from germany 
in 1915 
the league of nations in 1920 authorized south africa to govern 
the territory but the leagues successor the united nations 
revoked the mandate in 1966 
south africas offer to grant independence june 1 marks the 
first time it has set a target date for leaving namibia 
but south africa also raised several unresolved questions such 
as who will help pay namibias bills and guarantee its loans once 
south africa departs 
the announcement caught many in namibia by surprise some say a 
sudden rush to independence could lead to chaos in a territory that 
has more than 40 political parties and 11 ethnic groups ranging 
from the nomadic bushmen to a 20000strong german community 
the whites are very worried and you will see an exodus to some 
extent said kosie pretorius a cabinet minister and head of the 
allwhite national party we are concerned about the economy 
about losing our cultural identity and about being dominated by a 
black majority government 
when it appeared namibia was close to independence in 1978 
about 25000 whites or 25 percent of the white population fled 
the territory most went to south africa 
the 75000 remaining whites make up only 6 percent of the 
population but they pay almost 90 percent of the personal income 
taxes and run the mining industry the countrys largest source of 
revenue 
we cant afford to scare whites out of namibia and open 
ourselves to destabilization said moses katjiuongua a black 
cabinet minister 
independence will create its own problems but we cant go 
backwards now he said weve already had too many 
frustrations

tens of thousands of townspeople 
set up barriers parked buses in streets and blocked roads with 
market stalls saturday to prevent opponents of us military bases 
from rallying near a navy base 
police said about 30000 people including vendors and bar 
waitresses faced off against about 5000 antibase protesters on 
the outskirts of olongapo a town about 50 miles west of manila 
that houses the subic bay naval base a city official estimated the 
crowd at closer to 60000 
at least one protester was injured when the convoy he was 
traveling in was stoned a few miles near olongapo 
the townspeople many of whom depend on the subic base for their 
livelihood snarled traffic for several hours as they blocked all 
roads to the base preventing a 50vehicle convoy of protesters 
from entering town 
olongaponians love peace and order so please dont bother 
us said one of the placards carried by the townspeople we beg 
you not to disturb the peace in olongapo said another residents 
some cursing warned the demonstrators to go home or else 
some of the townspeople parked buses in the middle of streets to 
block traffic and market vendors used their stalls as roadblocks 
riot police stood between the two groups to prevent clashes 
olongapo has 250000 residents including thousands of 
prostitutes bartenders and dancers working in bars and hotels near 
the us base the local economy depends not only on the base but 
on port calls by ships 
at the subic base about one mile from the confrontation site 
heavily armed filipino and us troops guarded the gates which 
were buffered by several rows of barbedwire barricades 
the demonstrators left after several hours and promised to 
return to enlighten the minds of the olongapo residents 
on friday 2000 students and some roman catholic nuns marched 
to the clark air base in the nearby city of angeles to demand that 
us military facilities in the country be closed after an 
allnight vigil they moved on to subic 
clark and subic are the largest us military bases outside the 
united states about 40000 service personnel defense department 
civilians and military dependents are stationed at clark subic and 
four smaller installations in the philippines 
president corazon aquino has come under increasing pressure from 
leftists government officials and opposition leaders not to renew 
the 1947 bases agreement she has agreed to honor the lease through 
1991 but refuses to say if she will support an extension 
us and filipino panels have been negotiating in the 
philippines for more than four months on terms to apply during the 
agreements last two years 
the manila government is demanding that compensation for the 
bases be increased to 12 billion annually according to sources 
close to the talks 
the united states currently provides 180 million a year in 
military and economic aid in exchange for continued use of the 
bases 
government sources say the united states is not willing to pay 
such an increase unless it is assured the bases will be allowed to 
remain beyond 1991

the state has revoked the officers commission 
of a railroad policeman who was videotaped strolling naked through 
grand central terminal and taunting a homeless person 
however it was unclear if the officer sgt richard declara 
would keep his job with the metronorth commuter railroad in the 
wake of fridays announcement that his state commission was taken 
away 
the railroad suspended declara and six other officers earlier 
this month after the existence of the homemade tape was made public 
the tape was made on the night of st patricks day 1983 when 
the landmark railroad terminal was mostly deserted because of a 
strike declara was the focus of the tape with the other officers 
appearing in the background or being heard on the soundtrack 
declara was shown harassing a black homeless man with racial 
taunts imitating a lisping stereotype of a homosexual and walking 
nude except for his hat tie holster and shoes 
the railroad police benevolent association said the tape was 
just horseplay among the various participants the union has 
said it intends to fight any disciplinary action 
state superintendent of police thomas constantine has said 
previously that if he revokes an officers commission that means 
they would no longer have police powers and if that happens then 
metronorth probably would not continue them in employment 
metronorth president peter stangl said in a statement that he 
was delighted by fridays announcement and was looking forward 
to the commissioners expeditious action on the cases of the 
six other suspended officers 
the union contract with metronorth states that disciplinary 
action must be brought within 30 days after a commanding officer 
learns of the alleged wrongdoing 
in this case at least one commander knew about the tape in 
1985 the railroad acknowledged the railroad however plans to 
begin dismissal hearings on monday 
declara has an unlisted telephone number and could not be 
reached for comment in the past he has described the video as a 
comedytype tape just strictly for laughs

washington the pentagon is still giving securitycleared 
industry representatives access over the table to classified 
documents for bidding on sensitive projects despite allegations of 
bribes to get secret information 
responding to an inquiry by the associated press the defense 
department said it still has a longstanding policy under which 
contractors with a valid need to know can obtain entire 
descriptive summaries of futuristic research and development 
projects 
the open informationsharing system apparently has operated 
alongside the clandestine arrangements between consultants and 
pentagon employees that have been the subject of a 2yearold 
federal investigation of contracting abuse 
the investigation is searching for evidence that those using the 
underthetable system bribed defense department officials to 
obtain topsecret information including plans of one contractor 
that could be sold to another this material is far more sensitive 
than that given out in the open system according to private 
lawyers familiar with the practice 
the ap had asked the pentagon whether the voluntary system to 
supply consultants and contractors with classified information to 
help them through an unworkable bidding process still exists as 
described by a dod official in 1984 court testimony 
the written response provided by the defense advanced research 
projects agency darpa was that the policy and procedures were 
the same going back to at least 1982 the agency writes wish 
lists for future military projects 
questions about the policy were posed to that agency because one 
of its program management officers caroline a chewning testifed 
about the pentagons cooperation with private industry 
representatives in 1984 
she said they were unofficially given classified material 
because its in the governments best interest that contractors 
have this information if they had to go to official channels it 
may take them six months to get them youre on a tight contract 
award basis and you dont have time for that 
ms chewning added we must cooperate with private industry or 
else we are hurting we depend on private industry to build our 
systems 
the pentagon response to the inquiry focused on contractors 
needs for research development test and evaluation documents 
which include descriptive summaries of numerous individual programs 
for present and future years 
some of the large rdtampeoriented contractors such as 
aerospace and electronics companies have research and development 
projects and contracts that cut across most if not all of the 
technology fields supported by darpa 
it is thus conceivable that such a contractor could have a 
valid need to know for the entire agency descriptive summary in 
order to propose research in many of the agencys fields of 
interest the pentagon said 
specialized contractors the pentagon said would only have a 
need to know the information regarding their fields of competence 
theplanning and 
budget information only after clearance level storage capability 
and needtoknow are all demonstrated 
the individual receiving the information must be found 
trustworthy have the appropriate security clearance and show 
a demonstrated need to know 
the open system of giving documents to industry representatives 
has not been widely discussed ms chewning testified that her 
mouth fell open when a contractor she had never met called to 
ask her for an interpretation of a document she had written 
she said 95 to 99 percent of the information that 
consultants and contractors sought from her section was willingly 
handed out

george bush knows all about the frantic 
suspense surrounding late announcements of a presidential nominees 
running mate he got his own 11thhour call from ronald reagan in 
1980 
now hes doing his best to keep a dozen or so republicans on 
the same edge 
with his silence on a vice presidential choice bush is 
providing the only element of suspense in an otherwise suspenseless 
republican national convention 
bush says he hopes to make up his mind before he gets to new 
orleans even if he doesnt announce that decision until wednesday 
or thursday but aides insist the vice president still has not 
decided 
he was working on his campaign acceptance speech saturday while 
still keeping his own counsel on the vice presidential selection 
process 
its all being done mainly by the vice president said his 
campaign manager lee atwater the campaigns pollster robert 
teeter is helping him to a certain extent on the process but 
even he wont know in advance whom bush will select atwater said 
nor will his new campaign manager james a baker iii who was 
out of town on saturday atwater and other campaign aides suggested 
hes made it clear to all of us that he wants to make this 
decision on his own atwater said he knows the players he 
knows the candidates and hes ultimately going to make the 
decision himself and i dont anticipate hes going to share it 
with anybody except maybe his wife on wednesday 
on that score bush has joked that if he talks in his sleep in 
the meantime we could be in real trouble 
so the waiting game goes on for the dozen or so players 
known to be under what campaign aides call active consideration 
these run across the full spectrum of republicans both 
geographically and politically 
sen bob dole rkan bushs principal former rival for the 
gop nomination his strongest point say bush campaign aides is 
his popularity across the midwest but these aides also say they 
are fearful that democrats would seize on doles bitter attacks on 
bush during the primary campaigns to use as campaign ammuniton 
rep jack kemp rny another vanquished primary rival but a 
favorite among conservatives campaign aides say kemp could also 
help bring in bluecollar democratic votes and would help with 
california but they see his inability to muster votes in the gop 
primaries as a drawback 
sen alan simpson rwyo the assistant senate republican 
leader and a longtime close friend and fishing partner of bush he 
could help in the west but simpson himself has suggested his 
previous support for freezing social security benefit increases 
could be a liability 
sen dan quayle rind a darkhorse contender added to the 
list more recently bush campaign aides suggest he is being 
seriously considered both as a fresh face and for his base in the 
midwest 
elizabeth hanford dole former transportation secretary and the 
wife of bob dole who appears to be the only woman remaining under 
consideraton from an original list that included sen nancy 
kassebaum of kansas rep lynn martin of illinois and supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor 
sen pete domenici rnm the topranking budget committee 
republican who has earned a reputation for deficitfighting with 
his italian name he could also bring ethnic appeal to the ticket 
but some republicans feel hes too open to a tax increase 
gov tom kean of new jersey and attorney general richard 
thornburgh who is a former governor of pennsylvania aides suggest 
both men could help bring in the votes of moderates 
financial data has also been requested from new hampshire gov 
john sununu south carolina gov carroll a campbell former 
tennessee gov lamar alexander and sen john c danforth rmo 
govs george deukmejian of california and james thompson of 
illinois had figured in earlier speculation but both have asked 
that they not be considered 
lt gen colin l powell the first black ever to hold the post 
of national security adviser was not among the candidates bush 
campaign officials indicated were under active consideration but 
his name his turned up as a longshot contender in some recent 
speculation 
rep jim leach of iowa a moderate republican and bush adviser 
said that bush was making the right choice in holding off a 
decision although he added i dont think hes decided its 
easy to hold off something if you havent made your choice 
bush himself was selected as reagans running mate late on the 
nexttofinal day of the 1980 republican convention only after 
negotiations to select former president ford for the no 2 spot had 
broken down 
i hope ill make as good a choice but i think ill use a 
different method bush has quipped he has said he hopes his 
process including delaying a final decision until almost the last 
minute will not be demeaning to any of the people under 
consideration 
in his 1987 autobiography bush quotes mark twain on the subject 
of the vice presidency two brothers one went to sea and the 
other became vice president neither was ever heard from again 
still bush adds the message is clear although everybody 
belittles the office of the vice president not many people turn it 
down 
choosing a vice president has always been one of the most 
unpredictable rituals of modern american politics the vice 
president wrote

with an actors grace and a politicians 
flair president reagans farewell to the party he returned to the 
white house is designed to avoid stealing the show from the new 
standardbearer george bush 
reagan himself insisted on delivering his speech to the 
republican national convention on monday instead of later in the 
week where it might draw attention from bush officials say 
the two men will appear together at the belle chasse naval air 
station just before reagans departure on tuesday but it will be 
only a brief appearance 
this is his reagans swan song the convention will be awash 
with nostalgia says rep guy vander jagt head of the national 
republican congressional committee but it has to end on a note 
of looking to the future sending off the man we hope will be 
president for the next eight years 
it will be an emotional time for the man who appeared in several 
motion pictures hosted death valley days and ge theater 
and burst onto the national scene during the 1964 convention that 
nominated sen barry goldwater of arizona for president 
reagan who led the gop to the white house in 1980 in a bitter 
defeat for president jimmy carter faces a bittersweet transition 
as a 77yearold president with little beyond bushs election on 
his remaining agenda in retirement he plans to speak for repeal 
of the 22nd amendment limiting presidents to two terms 
the white house gave reagan the leading role he rarely got as a 
hollywood actor and hes relished this attention but a 
performers feel for stage positioning convinced reagan that bush 
must stand without him for thursdays climatic convention moments 
party and campaign officials say 
so the gop passed up the chance to have the nation see bush 
hoist his arms in a unity show with reagan however presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said tentative plans call for reagan and 
bush to meet on tuesday at belle chase naval air station as reagan 
is leaving the convention city and bush is arriving 
republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf talking of reagans 
monday night speech said i think were going to see a very 
proud man proud of the accomplishments of the last seven years 
ronald reagan at his age looks as good if not better than he 
did when he came into office fahrenkopf said ronald reagan is 
an individual who knows who he is and is comfortable with who he 
is thats why in many ways ronald reagan doesnt have an ego 
problem 
a source who participated in talks about the presidential role 
in new orleans discussing a conversation on grounds of anonymity 
said reagan at one point this spring argued forcefully about which 
day he would speak 
initially it was penciled in that he would do the speech on 
tuesday night this source said but he realizes that wherever 
he goes hes the focus of media attention this was his decision 
he said i dont want to do it tuesday i want to do it monday 
gov thomas keans keynote address was thus put off until 
tuesday as party strategists sought to make reagans valedictory 
and bushs coming out party politically compatible and graceful 
mitchell daniels white house political adviser in earlier 
reagan years said no one is more conscious of the need for this 
to be a george bush convention than ronald reagan 
hell be very comfortable with the balance that has been 
struck said daniels a hudson institute scholar whos going to 
the convention as a delegate from indiana a lesser man would 
have insisted on a bigger share of the limelight 
said vander jagt rmich the challenge is to make hello 
to george bush as exciting as goodbye to ronald reagan 
from a variety of republican sources declining to be named 
publicly the reagan itinerary in new orleans will go like this 
the president and his wife nancy will arrive on sunday have 
dinner with several members of the family and renew some political 
acquaintances on monday mrs reagan will be the guest of honor at 
a luncheon being organized by the presidents daughter maureen 
reagan on monday night former sen paul laxalt rnev will 
deliver a testimonial to his longtime friend mrs reagan will 
precede her husband on the podium speaking briefly to the 2277 
convention delegates 
after that there will be a film presentation on the reagan 
presidency the president will arrive on the podium while delegates 
are watching the film in darkness to await his reception when the 
lights go back on 
hell address a fundraising breakfast away from the convention 
hotel tuesday morning and then head to his vacation ranch in the 
santa ynez mountains of california 
reagan who reminded the 1984 dallas convention it was the 
last time he would address such a gathering as a candidate has 
said people should be able to elect a president as often as they 
wish 
but he also has said he was never interested in a seeking a 
third term 
james david barber a duke university presidential scholar said 
the mood at the new orleans convention will likely be cheerful but 
also nostalgic 
nancys counsel to him reagan will be that this is the 
last major speech that hell make in a power situation and 
therefore it should be the best barber speculated he said that 
mrs reagan seems to have a fundamental concern with how 
history will judge her husband 
therell be a lot of cheers a lot of tears when reagan 
speaks said donald devine a former head of the office of 
personnel management who now runs citizens for america a 
selfstyled grassroots reagan organization 
im sure whats going on in their mind is they dont want 
ronald reagan to steal the scene and thats a legitimate 
consideration devine said i think at first the president was 
a little bit hesitant about warmly embracing bushs candidacy 
but i have do doubt that they are working together now

boston is bracing for a decadelong overhaul of 
its antiquated highway system and for the headaches that will go 
with it including the possibility of a torrent of rats being 
unleashed by the big dig 
the 45 billion project includes a plan to build a third tunnel 
under boston harbor and transform the central artery interstate 93 
through downtown from a sixlane elevated highway to an eight to 
10lane underground expressway 
experts say that without the new design 14hour gridlocks could 
someday develop construction officials promise a new grander 
boston will emerge from the rubble and disarray that will begin 
affecting motorists later this year 
in place of the rusting 29yearold interstate that divides 
downtown from bostons north end and waterfront officials envision 
either a long narrow park or small controlled development above 
the underground expressway 
there will be a dramatic difference said martha bailey 
manager for environment and design for the project were giving 
the city the ability to reunite itself 
but sam wood head of the city department known as the rat 
patrol warns that the construction will destroy the habitat of 
millions of rats in underground burrows and old buildings and that 
they could overrun the city 
if someone doesnt take an aggressive stand and fight this 
with a careful program and education then its going to be a bad 
situation wood said 
in boston there is one rat for every two people a rat debacle 
occurred during construction on the southeast expressway in 1984 
when rodents overran areas like the south end section of the city 
people whisper about rats wood said they dont want to 
talk about them out loud theyre afraid of them they dont want 
to think about them 
woods inspectional services rodent control department has asked 
the state to fund a 500000 antirat plan including early baiting 
and inspection state officials are also planning to hire a rodent 
expert 
ninety percent of the staterun construction project is being 
funded by the federal highway administration 
certain expressways will be limited to one and two lanes during 
the construction worsening bostons already legendary traffic 
crunch 
to help ease the traffic the massachusetts bay transportation 
authority has been granted 3 billion to improve public 
transportation officials are hoping to persuade motorists to take 
trains buses subways and ferries to work 
according to a survey last year 39 percent of all commuters 
said they plan to change the way they get into boston and 54 
percent who use the central artery said they will drive another 
route 
the third harbor tunnel will be four lanes wide and 4200 feet 
long when it is opened in 1994 
the new 39mile expressway will carry traffic between the end 
of the massachusetts turnpike across south boston and the citys 
northeastern suburbs past logan international airport 
we have the opportunity to improve the urban character of the 
city and give it more of a feel for open space said city 
transportation commissioner richard dimino the city will lend 
itself more to a walk in the park

a private man in public life george bush 
admits to discomfort in discussing such personal matters as his 
family typically he calls them our gang and reverts to terms 
coaches use for their best players 
as well they may be for as bush heads into the fall campaign 
against michael dukakis his energetic brood is being unleashed as 
a formidable political weapon 
were not political pros but weve got political seasoning 
says george w bush the vice presidents eldest son and a top 
campaign strategist in what may be a bit of understatement 
the bushes are veterans of many years spent in the public eye as 
bush trekked from congress to diplomatic posts in china and at the 
united nations to the cia and then to the no 2 spot at the white 
house 
his wife barbara has been described as an indefatigable 
campaigner who shrugs off talk about herself such as that she dye 
her white hair but bristles when her husband is criticized 
george jr has run for congress with brother neil his campaign 
manager and his other siblings are active in grassroots party 
politics all are delegates at the gop convention in new orleans 
and all are actively involved in trying to get their father to the 
top spot in the white house 
heading into the fall campaign the family is increasingly 
speaking out about love that they have for each other as 
george jr puts it in short all the publicity about warm dukakis 
family relationships have not been lost on bush strategists 
weve had a very close family for years says george jr 
im glad they have one too 
his father who says his proudest accomplishment is that our 
children still come home believes his clan will do fine in the 
political battle of the families 
were just getting our gang out onto the field he said 
recently aboard air force ii we will do all right if it gets 
onto that 
on one august weekend the family was at the summer home in 
kennebunkport maine taping television advertisements highlighting 
their relationship the vice president admits thats something hes 
not quite comfortable with 
i havent advertised this as much as i think one has to these 
days but its important to us always has been so were not 
trying to do something artificial if i were hamming it up and 
getting a bunch of disenchanted kids to come so we could have 
pictures taken that wouldnt be very good but thats not what 
happens when were together bush says 
by all accounts the bush family has always been competitive 
the time spent at the oceanfront maine home is not idly whiled 
away there is tennis horseshoes other contests 
they play games to win theyre very nice about it its 
genteel but only up to a point that tennis balls coming over the 
net about 90 miles an hour says thomas w l lud ashley a 
former ohio congressman and a family friend for over 40 years 
ashley says bush has never sported his family the way some 
politicians do and adds that bush and his wife barbara are not 
given to public displays like the dukakises 
the bushes dont talk much about their sixth child robin who 
died at age 3 of leukemia bush in his book looking forward 
says that during her illness barbara and i susained each other 
to this day like every parent who has ever lost a child we 
wonder why yet we know that whatever the reason she is in gods 
loving arms he writes 
the other children were raised in what son jeb has called a 
matriarchal family dad wasnt home at night to play catch 
he told an interviewer mom was always the one to hand out the 
goodies and the discipline 
mrs bush put it differently somebody has to take care of the 
nest and thats me 
the family has been protective when bush has come under fire as 
he did during the administrations irancontra affair barbara bush 
once said there are only six things in this world you cant 
criticize george bush and my children i am a mother hen that 
way 
the family has been a source of great strength during the good 
times as well as the bad times says george jr when ugly 
things are said about our dad we tend to circle the wagons 
in the race toward november the bush clan will be circling the 
country 
george jr 42 says hell be spending time in the southwest 
his brother neil 33 who lives in denver will hit the west 
brother marvin 31 who lives in virginia has the southeast jeb 
35 leaves his job as florida commerce secretary to handle southern 
california and sister dorothy bush leblond 29 of maine will 
handle the northeast theyll focus on what george jr calls the 
secondary markets 
we cant expect to get air time in a bigcity market but when 
you go to a city like midland texas my hometown off the beaten 
path the people out there appreciate your coming and the media 
appreciate it says george jr

a great white shark attacked a 
surfer near the mouth of the klamath river and park rangers 
started a shark patrol after a fisherman spotted another great 
white 200 yards off a popular beach 
he grabbed me sucked me under water and then let me go 
said carl lafazio who required 27 stitches in his right thigh 
after the attack thursday 
lafazio 27 said after the shark bit him once it came back for 
a final assault but failed when he made it to shore with the help 
of four friends he was in stable condition at sutter coast 
hospital 
about 250 miles south of crescent city officials at marin 
countys stinson beach 15 miles north of san francisco said they 
were taking seriously a fishermans reported sighting of a great 
white shark 
ranger richard danielsen said friday a shark patrol will 
continue through the weekend but said the park district has 
decided against issuing warnings about possible sharks in the 
waters 
if rangers in a 16foot boat see a shark or find mangled seal 
carcasses they probably will close the beach danielsen said 
bruce barsotti 38 said he was at the wheel of his 25foot 
fishing boat tuesday night when a shark about 13 feet long lunged 
out of the water 
i was stunned i was just in awe i couldnt believe the 
mouth on it barsotti said

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
who cites the pentagon purchasing scandal in almost every campaign 
speech oversees a procurement system described by the 
massachusetts inspector general as almost a standing invitation 
to fraud waste and abuse 
inspector general joseph baressi a fellow democrat has 
delivered scathing attacks on three aspects of the states 
purchasing system its procedures for buying supplies and 
equipment its guidelines for obtaining services through 
consultants and its laws governing purchases by city town 
district and county governments 
a spokesman for the massachusetts governor said many of the 
problems have been corrected internally in recent months but 
baressis office while praising some of the steps taken to protect 
against fraud said only new laws will correct giant flaws in the 
system 
the commonweath routinely enters into large illdefined 
endless contracts in which genuine competition is illusory and 
money is no object baressi told the legislature earlier this 
year too often the vendor is paid both to tell the state what 
services to buy and then to sell those very services to the state 
year after year 
except in the areas of construction bidding and designer 
selection the commonwealths contracting procedures are almost a 
standing invitation to fraud waste and abuse 
baressis deputy stephen e cotton gave a similar account of 
exisiting state provisions governing procurement by local 
governments calling them vague confusing weak arbitrary and 
outdated 
those criticisms are not unlike a comment by a former pentagon 
undersecretary that dukakis has used recently in his campaign stump 
speech 
quoting congressional testimony of the former official david 
packard dukakis told several rallies that the reagan 
administration has helped create an environment in which and i 
quote honest and efficient military acquisition is impossible 
he also blames the pentagon scandal and other problems in the 
reagan administration on a contempt for public service and said 
the president and vice president george bush must accept 
responsibility 
theres an old greek saying and i suspect the italians have 
the same one you know the fish rots from the head first it 
starts from the top 
at home dukakis said i accept the responsibility for 
problems in his administration and said that chief executives are 
from time to time hurt by the conduct of government workers 
massachusetts revised its contracting procedures for 
construction and building design in 1980 after a special commission 
found them riddled with faults that invited corruption but the 
states procurement system which involves purchases well in 
excess of 1 billion a year remains for the most part guided by a 
1922 law 
david wood a spokesman for the governor said the states new 
purchasing agent rick murphy has implemented several internal 
policy changes in the past eight months that he said virtually 
eliminate fraud waste and abuse among them the establishment of 
a legal section that reviews purchasing agreements and a 
requirement that all contracts be in writing 
but cotton citing murphys support for legislation to revise 
purchasing standards said that the lack of a tough law will limit 
the effectiveness of murphys internal efforts to improve the 
system 
the rules or rather the absence of rules create the 
vulnerability cotton said 
in the past year alone there have been several cases in which 
the state procurement laws have come under scrutiny 
in april the massachusetts water resources authority the 
agency charged with cleaning up boston harbor put out a request 
for bids that invited suppliers to make offers to sell the state 
such items as trucks electric tools blades bags bars signs and 
drills without being more specific 
in february 19 people were indicted included three current and 
former state employees for allegedly bilking the state department 
of public works of more than 350000 by either overbilling or 
submitting bills for work never done baressi has complained there 
is a lack of safeguards in existing procurement laws to prevent 
such fraud many of those charged in the case were private 
consultants contracted by the department 
baressi also said in a report last year that many state agencies 
have split purchases to deliberately circumvent requirements that 
items costing more than 500 be put out for competitive bids 
the inspector general has offered three proposals to strengthen 
the system but all three have languished in the legislature 
dukakis supports two of them bills affecting state purchases of 
equipment and supplies and similar puchases by local governments 
but has given mixed signals on the measure affecting the hiring of 
consultants 
the administration and state commissions have relied heavily on 
consultants to do work ranging from changing lightbulbs to helping 
orchestrate the multibillion dollar harbor cleanup a practice 
which has prompted criticism from baressi and a wide array of 
legislators 
a work force of their own is how state auditor a joseph 
denucci described the burgeoning corps of consultants 
the state in fiscal 1987 spent more than 400 million on private 
consultants and another 800 million to contract services for human 
services programs another 477 million was spent on private 
consultants in fiscal 1988 which ended june 30 
there are times when we have had sharp disagreements with the 
inspector general said james dorsey the governors chief 
spokesman not about attacking the problem of fraud waste and 
abuse but how best to do it 
chief among those disagreements is the use of consultants 
we find there is a strong argument to make that putting 
engineers and scientists and others on the full time state payroll 
rather than hiring them as consultants for temporary duty is a 
greater waste dorsey said last week 
the administration adopted new guidelines that have stricter 
limits on the scope and length of work that can be performed by 
consultants but cotton said they are too vague 
you could drive a freight train through all the loopholes 
he said

to dominate news media attention during the partys national 
convention week a democrat is giving the gop a run for its money 
in garnering the most interviews 
by the end of the preconvention week mayor sidney j 
barthelemy had given at least 75 planned interviews plus numerous 
impromptu chats according to his press secretary who said she

we always dont get the good press barthelemy said so i 
think this is an opportunity to tell the good things show the 
media that this is a city where you can have a good time and do 
business and this is a city that takes care of business 
i hope people will leave here and will have a positive view of 
the city if they already didnt have one he said i hope that 
some of the people in business will leave here with the idea of 
returning and perhaps opening a business 
thats the message barthelemy has been spreading to anyone who 
wants to listen and there have been plenty of reporters lining up 
for interviews 
he loves doing them said jinx broussard the mayors press 
secretary he thinks this is the chance to show off the city and 
the fact that were not just the big easy were on the road to 
recovery from the oil and gas collapse and a good place to raise a 
family 
hes talked with the national news media has been a hot item 
with the scores of newspapers in new orleans for the convention 
has been interviewed by two london newspapers and plans a lengthy 
session with foreign journalists during the next week ms 
broussard said 
barthelemys role is that of a goodwill ambassador since after 
all this is a republican convention 
i would have been an active player in the democratic 
convention he said now im just an active player in hosting 
the convention 
barthelemy who was elected vice chair in charge of voter 
registration at last months democratic national convention in 
atlanta said hes not bothered by the fact the republicans did not 
invite him to issue an official greeting on the conventions 
opening night 
naturally i would have been glad to do it he said but 
its their convention 
amid the gop hoopla the mayor admits the 1992 democratic 
convention is in the back of his mind during the atlanta meeting 
his officials spread the message we would like to have you guys 
in 92 barthelemy said

iraq on saturday urged arab states to expel 
syria from the arab league citing syrian policy in lebanon its 
attacks on palestinian camps in beirut and its alliance with iraqs 
archenemy iran 
first deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan said arab 
nations should cut off all financial aid to syria and end dealings 
with president hafez assad 
the minimum arab leaders could do is expel the traitor assad 
from their fold and to boycott him ramadan also a member of the 
revolutionary command council wrote in an article in the governing 
baath party paper althawra 
to maintain contacts with assad whether directly or 
indirectly means they are encouraging him and taking part in his 
crimes ramadan said 
a proposal to expel syria would have to be considered during an 
arab league summit meeting it is unlikely iraq would prevail if 
such a proposal came to a vote the next meeting has not been 
scheduled 
ramadans article contained iraqs strongest attack in recent 
memory on the syrian leader it came several days after iraq and 
iran accepted a unsponsored ceasefire to start aug 20 in their 
8yearold war 
syria has been a staunch supporter of persian iran against arab 
iraq in the war which started in september 1980 attempts to 
reconcile baghdad and damascus in the past seven years have failed 
due to deep mistrust between the two countries 
syria sent 40000 troops into lebanon and west beirut to control 
fighting between rival militias 
all major arab countries belong to the 21member arab league 
with the exception of egypt whose membership was suspended after 
it signed the camp david accord with israel 
in a 1978 summit in baghdad the league pledged 18 billion in 
aid to syria as a confrontation state bordering israel

with all the restraint of an elephant doing 
the fulltilt boogie the party town and the grand old party are 
celebrating this week what they have in common 
party more than 500 separate bashes are scheduled for 
convention week enough to send george bush into the presidential 
fray on a tidal wave of hurricane rum punch the republicans plan 
some business for sure but after all this is new orleans 
new orleans will use anything for an excuse for a party no 
matter what happens theres a party said doris finney a 
celebrant friday night at well a party bring on the 
republicans new orleans will party all week 
finney was taking in one of the more staid events by local 
standards a family affair at city park featuring fireworks gospel 
music and tunes from the enforcers a band of sheriffs 
deputies rocking out in full uniform 
jambalaya went for a buck a bowl and mayor sidney barthelemy 
dished out some new orleans understatement weve showed 
everybody he announced that we could put on the greatest 
event in the history of this country 
hyperbole may be the hallmark of good times here its 
wonderful i am 200 percent republican said alice mongeau 
watching the colored shells burst over the park and her city 
sure its republican too she said 
not quite democrats outnumber republicans by better than 
5to1 and barthelemy liked jesse jackson not exactly a george 
bush soulmate but in the crescent city ideology is not about to 
stand in the way of a good time 
were talking about hospitality said sheriff charles foti 
host of the city park party unusual for a sheriff to throw a 
party sure its unusual he said chewing on an unlit cigar 
this is an unusual town 
in some sections its a downright kinky town in the bawdy 
french quarter where strip joints vie with jazz joints merchants 
were waiting anxiously to see if political conservatives like to 
loosen up early results were mixed 
theres a lot of people out here but they aint going in 
anywhere bemoaned manny moreland the doorman at papa joes a 
club on bourbon street where female impersonators dance nearly 
naked maybe theyre afraid to 
not all were timid we had a few delegates come in they had 
their badges on allowed moreland from new york good 
tippers 
it was a similar story across the street at the unisex club 
where actual women do the writhing but the early crowd that is 
pre1 am was a tad thin theyre just walking the street 
right now said doorman barry whatley but well catch em 
later after theyve had a few hurricanes 
bill ahle manager of pat obriens the home of the hurricane 
was all for that we ordered extra stock to get us through the 
week he said the stock is equal measures of cocktail punch and 
rum the effect is powerful 
but getting hammered and looking at strippers is not the only 
game in town there are riverboat cruises and jazz brunches 
fundraiser receptions and state delegation dinners six groups 
have rented out the stately museum of art for private affairs this 
week including a masked ball 
the convention master schedule lists everything from a platform 
committee reception on page one to an open house with the womens 
opera guild association on page 48 in between comedian rich 
little will entertain the conservative victory committee ball the 
heads of 30 fortune 500 companies will do brunch and a 500member 
choir will let loose at a prayer breakfast 
in their spare time the republicans will nominate their 
candidate and on bourbon street the hawkers will keep on hoping 
its a working convention for these people i know that 
said helen cavanaugh a waitress at the french casino strip joint 
but maybe after its over some of em will stay around and have 
fun

radical students battled police with 
firebombs and rocks and beat riot troopers with iron bars saturday 
as protesters vowed to reach the north korean border for 
unification talks 
hundreds of students caught police by surprise when they charged 
out of yonsei university to attack troops encircling the campus to 
try and stop radicals assembling for a march monday to the border 
troopers were sleeping or resting when students charged them 
hurling firebombs and lashing out with iron bars and clubs at 
least three troopers were knocked senseless and dozens of others 
injured as they tried to fend off blows with shields or fled 
advance national reunification and yankees go home the 
protesters chanted 
police were forced back by the rampaging students until hundreds 
of reinforcments were rushed up from nearby sidestreets to drive 
the howling protesters back with volleys of tear gas 
national police headquarters in seoul said many officers and 
protesters were injured but no figures were available police said 
dozens of students were arrested 
about 200 students demonstrating at myongdong roman catholic 
cathedral in the center of seoul earlier tried to break through 
surrounding police lines with firebombs but were driven back 
more than 3000 riot police surrounded yonsei in western seoul 
to block the march to the border truce site of panmunjom for talks 
with communist north korean student delegates on reunification the 
government banned the march and police are on top alert to block it 
meanwhile a group of north korean students who hope to 
participate in the talks arrived on saturday at kaesong a border 
town near panmunjom the north korean central news agency said in a 
report monitored in tokyo 
it said the students marched from the northern part of the 
peninsula to pyongyang where they boarded buses to continue their 
trip toward panmunjom 
the report didnt say how many students were involved 
in south korea about 4000 students many from other cities 
managed to get past the police cordon around yonsei university but 
dozens of students were halted and taken away by police who 
questioned and searched people approaching the school police 
officers beat and kicked some detained students 
student leaders said they would go ahead with the march despite 
the massive police deployment we will never never give in 
said one 
kim yongkap minister of government administration said the 
students were becoming a threat to stability and the administration 
might have to take drastic measures to suppress violent protests 
president roh taewoo said friday that violent protests were a 
threat to the olympics to be held in seoul sept 17oct 2 and 
said the government would not tolerate continued unrest 
student protests over the past week in support of mondays march 
have been relatively small with just a few thousand people taking 
part 
the students want to meet with north korean student delegates at 
panmunjom for talks on reuniting the divided korean peninsula they 
also demand removal of the 42000 us troops in south korea under 
a treaty and contend washington backs military rule in the country 
most south koreans oppose the talks and riot police blocked a 
similar march in june turnout for the rallies for the latest march 
has been lower than in june 
several hundred shopkeepers and residents staged demonstrations 
in seoul to demand students stop violent protests residents living 
around yonsei demanded students abandon the march 
this is terrible people are against this a middleaged 
businessmen complained as he watched students fighting police 
radical students seized on the reunification issue to try and 
mobilize public support for their antigovernment campaign the 
students a small but powerful minority on campuses have failed to 
gain support because of violent tactics and open advances to the 
totalitarian north 
the peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of world 
war ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean 
war

elmo r zumwalt iii son of the 
admiral who ordered the spraying of agent orange in vietnam and who 
was exposed to the defoliant himself died at his home saturday 
from cancer he was 42 
zumwalt a lawyer said he never blamed his father for his 
disease the two cowrote a book titled my father my son 
which was made into a television movie 
zumwalt was diagnosed in january 1983 as having stage 4 
nonhodgkins lymphoma in february 1985 during his ninth biopsy 
doctors discovered he had stage 3 hodgkins disease another form of 
lymphoma 
agent orange contains highly toxic dioxin veterans had 
contended that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses 
they said it caused miscarriages by wives of servicemen and birth 
defects in their children 
zumwalts son elmo russell zumwalt iv suffers from a 
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses 
in an article published in the washington post on oct 7 1984 
zumwalt said my father adm elmo zumwalt jr was a strong 
advocate of the use of agent orange in the vietnam war that 
doesnt mean that i hold him responsible for any disease i may have 
incurred he did what he felt he had to do to reduce casualties i 
did what i felt i had to do i volunteered for service in vietnam 
because i felt whatever the risks that was where i belonged even 
now at the age of 38 im confronted by undoubted perils i am not 
sorry i went 
on june 30 the us supreme court removed the last legal 
obstacle to a 180 million settlement between vietnam veterans and 
the manufacturers of agent orange the justices let stand rulings 
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged 
the 1984 settlement 
the 180 million settlement now totals about 240 million with 
interest as many as 250000 people could receive money from the 
settlement 
the elder zumwalt said he ordered agent orange sprayed over the 
mekong delta to kill vegetation and drive the viet cong back 
1000 yards off the waters edge 
he commanded naval forces in vietnam from 19681970 then served 
as chief of naval operations until 1974 when he retired from active 
duty his son served in vietnam from june 1969 to august 1970 as a 
lieutenant junior grade commanding a patrol boat 
i do not have any guilt feelings because i was convinced then 
and i am convinced now that the use of agent orange saved literally 
hundreds and maybe thousands of lives the elder zumwalt told the 
associated press in 1985 
in addition to his son zumwalt is survived by his wife 
katherine and his daughter maya 13

for the past several weeks crowds of armenians 
have gathered outside the us embassy hoping for word they can 
come to america at night they sleep at friends homes railroad 
stations or wherever they can find room 
the embassy stopped processing their applications for refugee 
status july 1 because the us state department ran out of money 
for the program 
beginning this week embassy officials expect to start the 
process again under a new program that requires refugees and their 
families in the united states to pay a bigger share of resettlement 
expenses 
but it will take us consular officials weeks to catch up with 
the backlog of 3000 people who already had been told to report for 
predeparture interviews when the money ran out and 1600 people 
who have applied since 
abel kasoyans journey to los angeles to be reunited with his 
sister is one of those that stalled in moscow 
the 30yearold kasoyan his father mother wife and two 
children aged 3 and 5 arrived in the capital july 1 from armenia a 
soviet republic bordering turkey and iran 
he carried a slip of paper from the us embassy that told him 
to report july 19 for an interview and then a quick departure 
he still has not been interviewed 
the family which sold its belongings has had to scramble for 
food and lodging we lived in the kursk railroad station in 
moscow almost a week he said in an interview last week across 
the street from the embassy 
others who joined him said they didnt understand how the us 
government could run out of money but they said they still wanted 
to go to america 
people have been waiting for years and now its impossible 
for financial reasons said 54yearold gratich froundjian of 
yerevan the armenian capital if its possible to find millions 
of dollars for the contras in nicaragua they can find money for 
us too 
the us refugee resettlement program ran out of money because 
of a sharp increase in the number of people the soviet union is 
allowing to emigrate 
the embassy in june gave permission to a record 2063 soviets to 
immigrate more than in all of fiscal year 1987 about 94 percent 
of that total were armenians us officials say 
we recognize the difficulty theyre in and were trying to be 
helpful a diplomat said 
the embassy tried to contact people to warn them not to come to 
moscow because of the budgetary problems he said 
well move these people just as fast as we can he said i 
dont think anybody will be going out next week but well start 
interviewing people next week 
several us senators and congressmen criticized the original 
suspension of the program until the new fiscal year begins oct 1 
as a terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the 
world 
under the new rules relatives in the united states must file an 
affidavit of financial support or guarantee of employment and the 
immigrants or their relatives must pay for transportation after a 
ussponsored flight to rome 
some armenians are worried that the additional requirements may 
delay their resettlement 
our relatives have to accept us and support us said gagam 
petrossyan 48 of yerevan who wants to join his brother in los 
angeles my relatives still arent in a position to support me

one in seven vietnam veterans suffers from 
posttraumatic stress disorder a rate seven times that estimated 
by a government study earlier this year a researcher reported 
saturday 
the 15 percent rate cited in the latest study translates to 
about 470000 cases 
the discrepancy with the 22 percent rate reported earlier by 
the federal centers for disease control arises mostly from 
differences in the criteria for diagnosis 
in contrast to a single yardstick used in the cdc study the new 
estimate relied on several measures said researcher william 
schlenger 
to me the compelling reason for believing were right is we 
have these multiple measures said schlenger of the research 
triangle institute in research triangle park nc 
he described the study at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association and in interviews 
posttraumatic stress disorder can appear months or years after 
a traumatic experience such as combat natural disaster or airplane 
crash 
symptoms include sudden vivid reliving of the experience 
nightmares that can make a person awaken screaming and intense 
distress from events that symbolize or resemble the trauma some 
victims remain on constant alert for danger 
the new estimate says the disorder afflicts 15 percent of male 
vietnam veterans and 9 percent of female vietnam veterans the 
number of females was small enough that the overall rate is still 
15 percent schlenger said 
the estimate was developed by researchers at schlengers 
institute a private notforprofit research firm san diego state 
university and the university of california at san francisco 
the national vietnam veterans readjustment study included 
long interviews with about 1600 veterans who served in vietnam 
laos or cambodia or the surrounding waters or airspace 
for comparison purposes researchers also interviewed veterans 
who served elsewhere during the vietnam era and a group of 
civilians of similar age sex racial and ethnic makeup 
the total number of interviews for all three groups was 3016 
the comparison groups showed much lower rates of stress disorder 
than the vietnam veterans but their estimates have not been 
released schlenger said 
the 15 percent rate combined with the finding that 387 percent 
of vietnam veterans were exposed to definite trauma such as combat 
or exposure to dead or dying people suggests that about a third of 
veterans who were exposed to such trauma in vietnam now suffer from 
the disorder schlenger said 
that underlines the longterm nature of the problem he said 
the difference with the earlier cdc estimate for vietnam 
veterans stems from differences in definition such as how recently 
a person has experienced symptoms the cdc study asked about 
symptoms experienced in the month before the interview while the 
new study went back six months 
researchers in the new study said the sixmonth period is better 
suited to the waxing and waning of symptoms 
the new study also used five diagnostic measures of which three 
had to agree on the diagnosis before it was officially assigned 
schlenger said in 87 percent of cases at least four measures 
agreed on the diagnosis he said 
robin morris a georgia state university associate professor of 
psychology and consultant to the cdc for its study said the 
measures in the new study were unavailable when the cdc began its 
project 
the overall difference between the two estimates boils down to 
where do you make the cut in how severe the problems are before 
you call it a case he said in a telephone interview 
we detected what would be severe cases said frank destefano 
of cdc a coauthor of the earlier study the new study used what 
would probably be more liberal criteria in which less severe 
cases would probably be included as well he said 
schlenger agreed that the cdc study probably found the most 
severe cases and said it overlooked some less severe ones that 
still could benefit from treatment 
cdc consultant morris said he did not really have any trouble 
with their findings both results clearly say theres a problem 
thats the issue for me

patrick holland said when he won a 35 
million lotto jackpot two years ago in the washington state lottery 
that he did not want to spend his money foolishly 
holland and his wife patricia filed for protection and 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law friday owing 
450000 to nine creditors who obtained court orders giving them 
rights to his next annual lottery payment 
he was a pauper before he won the lotto kind of a starving 
construction worker said his former wife karen klingler 
they divorced before he won the sweepstakes now shes a 
creditor and has obtained a garnishment for more than 15000 in 
support payments for their 11yearold daughter court records show 
hollands third annual payment of 140000 after a deduction 
for federal taxes is due thursday 
with fridays filing federal bankruptcy judge frank howard 
signed an order that the next payment go into a trust account for 
the time being said hollands attorney neil shillito 
the judge allowed the couple to take 3500 for living expenses 
and administrative costs of the case but other payments require a 
court order shillito said 
once the dust settles in a couple weeks well be in a better 
position to know how to go about taking care of the valid claims 
against the estate shillito said 
holland 34 and shillito have refused to discuss his business 
dealings or say how his ragstoriches story turned back to rags 
when he won the lotto in august 1986 holland told a reporter he 
was a building contractor he said he bought the van of his dreams 
and was looking for a fancy present for his daughter but wanted to 
avoid squandering his newfound wealth and planned to hire a 
financial adviser 
his exwife says he also bought a car a truck furniture tv 
satellite dish and a house and started a drycleaning business 
holland cleaners inc 
the business folded late last year said grant b anderson a 
former lawyer for the operation in january holland cleaners 
employees who had been working without pay for a month picketed the 
business but a company spokesman said money to pay them had been 
frozen since another drycleaning company purchased the business in 
december 
the drycleaning problem alone is a mess anderson said 
its an unfortunate situation 
creditors include two banks claiming about 197000 for three 
loans including one for the purchase of another drycleaning 
business tlc of tacoma 
holland and his wife also owe more than 154000 in medical 
bills much of it for the birth of their daughter michele on 
april 27 1987 court records show 
if the creditors do not receive all theyre due from the next 
lottery payment they probably will garnish future checks said jim 
lancaster an attorney for oregon first bank which is owed more 
than 170000

states delegations at the republican national convention to get 
the truth out about the democratic nominee 
the 10minute video which will be unveiled tuesday by 
republican national chairman frank fahrenkopf jr and state gop 
chairman ray shamie shows the truth rather than the myth that 
dukakis likes to perpetuate shamie said 
he talks about things puts a nice spin on them but the facts 
are quite different what were doing is debunking many of his 
statements shamie said in a preconvention telephone interview 
joseph malone the republican senate candidate trying to unseat 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said other states gop chairmen 
will get copies and each chairman will use it to get the truth 
out about mike dukakis 
it will point out what mike dukakis said in his speech about 
protecting the environment then point to the fact that 
massachusetts has the most polluted harbor in the nation in the 
boston harbor and the governor ignored that fact as the harbor 
became more and more polluted malone said 
it will point out his statements on balancing the budget and 
then point to the recent budget crisis in massachusetts he said 
were very familiar with the miracle shamie said a 
deriding reference to the states economic rebound that dukakis 
takes partial credit for on the presidential campaign trail

burmas wasted generation of 
students who braved bayonets and armored cars to force the 
resignation of a harsh leader may take to the streets again unless 
their demands for democracy and ecomomic reforms are met 
president sein lwin who stepped down friday after 17 days in 
power was a strong magnet for the students anger and passionate 
demands for a multiparty system release of political prisoners 
and changes in the shattered economy 
they are the storm troopers the spearhead those who took the 
initiative in organizing the demonstrations said bertil lintner 
a swedish journalist and scholar specializing in burma 
the 200000 university students and about 13 million high 
school students belong to what some burmese have called a wasted 
generation 
thousands of university graduates unable to find jobs in the 
troubled economy drive taxis sell trinkets in the marketplace or 
serve as night guards many have left the isolationist country 
where preworld war ii medical books are still used and the 
readers digest was once banned 
on saturday a day after sein lwins resignation the students 
continued to distribute leaflets urging protests for democracy 
the young people dozens of whom were killed this year in 
antigovernment protests appeared to have served as catalysts for 
sein lwins fall but they stopped short of storming the seat of 
power or proposing a leader to succeed sein lwin 
american burma expert josef silverstein said in an interview he 
believes the students are not well organized and do not have strong 
leaders and it appears professional military officers would have 
to step in to direct political events after sein lwins resignation 
students can make revolution but not what comes after said 
silverstein the author of several books on burma 
the state media announced friday that the governing burma 
socialist program party the countrys only political party for a 
quarter century would meet this week presumably to choose a new 
leader from the ranks of the military or the present government 
diplomats and other analysts say the most violent students may 
grant a more liberal new leader a honeymoon period before 
resuming protests that reflect their deep aversion to the existing 
political system 
but lintner said the students who in march virtually 
singlehandedly fought the brutal security forces led by sein lwin 
were joined in last weeks protests by citizens representing a wide 
spectrum of burmese society from buddhist monks to workers 
it looks like asianstyle chaos but they have a system and it 
works he said in an interview describing student organization 
as necessarily elastic and fluid based on trust and secrecy to 
prevent infiltraton by security services 
in the current issue of the hong kong newsmagazine far eastern 
economic review lintner said the students in the past few months 
have assembled a loose umbrella group known as the allburma 
students democratic association with 20 to 30 leaders at its core 
he said the group includes an information department an 
intelligence unit and a social welfare department to distribute 
food water and money to demonstrators the students who executed 
three suspected informants seized weapons by killing soldiers on 
night patrol he said 
their main weapons lintner said are knives and homemade 
spears or jinglee tainted with excrement or poison one 
foreign journalist said the students inexperience in street 
fighting was evident when a group of protestors appeared uncertain 
how to burn a vehicle 
robert taylor a londonbased burma scholar and author said 
rangoons leaders were hoisted by their own ideology students 
for years have studied books written by their elders who in their 
own student days fought the british and the japanese in burma 
burmese students entered the political scene in 1920 when they 
held a strike to protest university regulations imposed by the 
british they remained at the forefront of anticolonial agitation 
and played a prominent role during burmas chaotic postwar 
experiment in democracy 
the heady days came to a quick end after the military coup by 
former leader ne win in 1962 shortly after ne win came to power 
sein lwin crushed a student protest at rangoon university and 
ordered troops to blow up the universitys student union building 
a symbol of student activism 
since then students staged about a dozen massive protests and 
the government responded each time by temporarily closing schools 
jailing protestors and attempting to infiltrate student groups 
in 1974 the students fought authorities whom they accused of 
giving the late burmese un secretarygeneral u thant a burial 
inappropriate to his respected position 
in march this year demonstrating students were attacked by sein 
lwins riot police and the government said more than 43 people 
were killed last week they led the largest antigovernment 
protests since burmas colonial times and the government said at 
least 95 people were killed

spurning medical advice that he was 
risking his life united farm workers union leader cesar chavez 
continued his fast into its 28th day saturday but grape growers 
say his effort has attracted more publicity than actual support for 
the unions 4yearold boycott 
the image of a frail chavez shuffling into the union meeting 
hall to attend mass has spurred unions from all over the country to 
send telegrams in support of his openended fast 
hollywood stars and children of the late sen robert kennedy 
came to this rural community 150 miles north of los angeles and 
made dramatic endorsements of the boycott and the presidentelect 
of mexico carlos salinas de gortari issued a statement on behalf 
of chavez 61 
what remains to be seen is if publicity raised by the longest 
fast of chavezs life will inspire consumers to stay away from 
california table grapes he conducted a 25day fast in 1968 and a 
24day fast in 1972 
two decades ago chavez had his first major success with another 
grape boycott the highly publicized fiveyear boycott ended when 
delanoarea growers agreed to a contract with the union in july 
1970 
but the ufw no longer has any contracts with california table 
grape growers and its duespaying membership has been halved since 
1978 to about 30000 
during the current boycott one california supermarket chain 
save mart has obtained court orders to stop picketing outside its 
stores officials of other california grocery stores and 
restaurants report little consumer action on behalf of the boycott 
im not aware of any impact directly related to the food 
service industry said stanley kyker executive vice president of 
the 9000member california restaurant association 
the boycott as far as im concerned has been nothing said 
charles collings president of raleys supermarkets and chairman of 
the california grocers association 
the union isnt providing a tally of stores cooperating with the 
boycott because store managers fear retribution from growers for 
supporting the union said ufw spokeswoman lorena parlee 
since beginning his wateronly diet july 17 chavez has lost at 
least 26 pounds and barely has the stamina to sit through a 
twohour nightly community meeting and mass he suffers bouts of 
nausea and dizziness and he nearly fell wednesday after standing 
for a prayer 
but despite those problems and a risk of kidney failure he 
refuses his doctors request to end the fast and enter the 
hospital chavezs mental condition reportedly remains sharp as he 
spends his time largely in bed reading works of martin luther king 
jr st francis of assisi and gandhi 
the boycott has two goals to halt the use of five pesticides 
and protest the states agricultural labor relations board which 
oversees farm labor elections the union claims the agency has 
become a tool of the republican administration of gov george 
deukmejian 
growers charge that chavez who has not talked to reporters 
during his fast has inflated dangers about the five pesticides in 
an attempt to bolster a weakened union 
if he were really worried about consumers health and the farm 
workers health then he would be saying ban chemicals from all 
products said bruce obbink president of the california table 
grape commission 
dr marion moses a union consultant said the ufw chose to 
boycott table grapes as a starting point to raise public 
consciousness on the problems of pesticides the union says grape 
pickers suffer the highest rate of pesticide poisonings in 
agriculture and grapes are among the most heavily sprayed crops 
jim wells a pesticide expert with the california food and 
agriculture department said that if you consider all the 
occupational illnesses grape workers get a large portion of 
them he explained that grape pickers frequently get rashes from 
sulphur spray and also from the intense heat in central california 
fields

comparing the republican and democratic party 
platforms is like comparing the ride in a learjet with travel on a 
crowded 747 both will get you there but my are the experiences 
different 
the republican platform is heavy with specifics from the 
heifer tax to protecting the pledge of allegiance in all 
schools 
the democratic document is much slimmer and sticks to themes 
from the american dream of opportunity to good jobs at good 
wages 
the democratic platform is about 5000 words the gop document 
more than 30000 
what we have done is be overly specific if there is any 
complaint you can make it is going to be tough for someone to read 
the whole thing but were not planning on people doing that 
said sen robert kasten of wisconsin a republican platform 
committee cochairman we were rushing in order to emphasize the 
vagueness in the democratic platform by becoming specific in ours 
the republicans bash michael dukakis over and over again 
without ever mentioning his name calling him only the democratic 
presidential nominee the democrats never mentioned george bush 
or ronald reagan and included the word republican only once 
party platforms are not crucial documents that shape the course 
of the presidential campaign few people outside the party faithful 
even read the rhetoric and presidents dont usually feel bound by 
platform promises when they take office 
but this year the platforms do provide a reading on what the 
candidates want to tell the voters 
and this year each document is undoubtedly what each partys 
nominee wanted while the candidates had to make some concessions 
bush to the hardline conservatives and dukakis to jesse jackson 
those adjustments were really at the margins 
the vice president is comfortable with this platform 
declared aide charlie black on friday as the gop platform committee 
wrapped up its work 
committee chairman kay orr the nebraska governor said bush 
called her saturday morning to say he was proud of the document 
the gop planks are resolutely conservative strongly 
anticommunist and antiabortion with a leavening of stances on 
such nontraditional issues as day care 
the democrats is a mix of liberal touchstones such as a 
fullemployment economy the equal rights amendment and 
abortion availabilty accompanied by conservativesounding 
declarations such as a strong commitment to fiscal 
responsibility 
the star wars missile defense system aid to the contras and 
opposition to the creation of a palestinian state highlight a gop 
foreign policy plank that boasts of reagan administration successes 
and promises more of the same 
the democratic document says we will cease dealing with drug 
smugglers and seek to reconcile our differences with countries in 
central america it also talks of clearheaded toughminded 
decisive american foreign policy and a role of responsible 
active international leadership 
the republicans were quick to say that they had covered all the 
major issues while accusing the democrats of ducking 125 major 
issues ranging from tax increases to pornography 
the democrats accused their opponents of retreading the 1980 and 
1984 platforms talking about the future through a rearview 
mirror 
rhetoric aside both platforms duck difficult issues the 
republicans talk about bushs flexible budget freeze without 
explaining how promised new programs and rapid and certain 
deployment of the strategic defense initiative could be paid 
for 
the democrats talk about finding the resources to pay for 
government programs without ever mentioning the dreaded t word 
taxes 
of course there are many themes that are shared by the 
platforms 
there are commitments to equal rights a strong economy and a 
strong defense a clean environment and drugfree schools 
one interesting similarity is that both talk about the need for 
change 
obviously the democrats focused on change because they want to 
change control of the white house after eight years in republican 
hands 
we believe it is time for america to change and move forward 
again in the interest of all its families says the democratic 
platform to turn away from an era in which too many of americas 
children have been homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of 
hope and progress an era of secure families in a secure america in 
a secure world 
but bush and the republicans seeking to build on the reagan 
legacy are also talking about change no doubt because the polls 
say americans want changes in the nations direction 
an election is about the future about change says the gop 
platform preamble americans want leadership to direct the forces 
of change on americas terms guided by american values 
the election will bring change the question is will it be 
change and progress with the republicans or change and chaos with 
the democrats 
change will come to the white house in 1989 no matter who is 
elected and the 1988 party platforms are a decent navigational aid 
for figuring out what changes in course may be coming

the house agriculture committee chairman 
praised the nations 39 billion droughtrelief program saturday 
and urged democrats to set the agenda for a major 1990 farm bill 
the aid that will be provided will give farmers hope and at 
least a portion of the financial resources they need to try again 
next year rep e kika de la garza dtexas said in the 
democratic response to president reagans weekly radio address 
the chairman took issue with neither reagan nor congressional 
republicans but instead strongly praised lawmakers for fashioning a 
1985 farm program and related measures that have helped the 
farmer survive difficult times 
but we cannot legislate weather so the devastating drought of 
1988 has set us back at least temporarily de la garza said he 
praised the relief bill signed thursday by reagan as one that would 
keep many farmers going even though we simply do not have the 
money to cover all losses 
the new law will pay farmers who have lost at least 35 percent 
of their crop 65 percent of their losses over that amount it will 
pay those who have lost at least 75 percent of their crop 90 
percent of their losses over that amount 
government livestock feed aid is expanded and streamlined under 
the program the dairy pricesupport level will be increased by 50 
cents for each 100 pounds of milk for three months in some cases 
farmers who would otherwise have to refund some advance 
incomesupport payments will be allowed to keep the money 
now that drought relief is in place the democrats in congress 
must set an agenda so that when we write the next farm bill we 
can provide an even better framework within which american farmers 
can compete in world trade while keeping americans the bestfed 
people in the world at reasonable prices de la garza said 
congress is expected to pass a new farm program in 1990 with 
preliminary debate probably getting under way next year the 
discussion is likely to usher in new demands for controls on crop 
production as a way of increasing prices

michael dukakis saluted rival george bush 
as a man of enormous courage and tremendous patriotism saturday 
while continuing his assault on president reagans irresponsible 
fiscal policy 
the democratic nominee interrupting a weekend on cape cod to 
meet with reporters was asked about a world war ii gunners 
challenge to bushs account of being shot down over the pacific 
the gunner disputed the vice presidents claim that the plane was 
on fire when he ejected 
i dont think that kind of thing has any place in a 
campaign dukakis said he served this country he served it 
with tremendous courage you dont fly 58 missions without enormous 
courage and tremendous patriotism 
dukakis continued to link the jump in the prime lending rate to 
10 percent this past week to the reagan administrations deficit 
spending 
im very concerned and i think all americans are concerned 
about whats happening to our economy he said this increase 
in interest rates is every bit as much a tax as a legislated tax 
the massachusetts governor and his wife kitty were spending 
the weekend at the home of mrs dukakis sister ginny peters and 
her husband al 
dukakis said he planned to take a swim saturday and spend most 
of the day reading issues papers and material about the presidency 
after tending to state business monday and tuesday he planned to 
head back out to the campaign trail during the republican national 
convention 
dukakis and his wife joked about a comment by bushs wife 
barbara that the public affection between the dukakises was phony 
youre not supposed to touch me its against the rules 
mrs dukakis said as she came out of her sisters home and sat next 
to her husband on a deck overlooking the water 
its a little bit of paradise off the beaten track dukakis 
said of the peters home he also led reporters and a few aides in 
singing happy birthday to a member of the press corps 
dukakis began focusing on economic issues thursday after major 
banks raised their prime lending rate to 10 percent 
on friday he called the increase an irresponsibility tax 
triggered by reagans deficit spending saturday he referred to it 
as a family tax that would drive up mortgage costs and prevent 
millions of people from buying homes 
the deficit and rising interest rates will create enormous 
inflationary pressure on the economy dukakis said it will be 
the american people who ultimately will pay the bills these are 
burdens which average american families should not be putting up 
with they are burdens that are the result of irresponsible fiscal 
policy 
while dukakis took the weekend off his campaign launched its 
first television ad of the general election campaign 
the 60second spot airing in texas and california touts dukakis 
economic successes as massachusetts governor and features several 
shots from his acceptance speech at the democratic national 
convention

putting yourself in the proper frame of mind can 
help you beat the heat as much as plugging in the air conditioner 
psychologists say 
its a time for people to learn to remain cool said michael 
r mantell chief psychologist for the san diego police department 
he was attending the annual meeting of the american psychological 
association 
stop telling yourself its awful its just hot mantell 
said at the very worst its an inconvenience 
it is very comforting to think and to realize that it could be 
worse he said 
though rainfall eased drought conditions in parts of the 
midwest much of the nation continued to swelter saturday and 
power consumption and temperature records fell 
this is like brazil said mel goldstein director of the 
weather center at western connecticut state university in danbury 
its tropical weather with high heat and the water vapor just 
absolutely saturating the atmosphere 
the temperature reached 90 degrees shortly after noon saturday 
in windsor locks conn it was the 12th day of the month with 
temperatures at 90 or above breaking the august record of 11 days 
with more than half the month still to go 
in new york city saturday was the 30th straight day with 
temperatures in the 90s consolidated edison said electricity use 
set a record friday while in boston heatrelated power outages 
affected more than 6000 customers 
temperatures in that range may have an effect on the safety of a 
top summer pastime a study released at the meeting saturday 
suggests baseball batters get beaned by pitches more often when the 
temperature is in the 90s maybe because the heat is making 
pitchers more aggressive 
its not so much that the beanballs are deliberate but rather 
the pitchers may be trying to move batters back from the plate 
prodded by discomfort from the heat said researcher alan reifman 
you might plan to throw it close and your aim is a little 
off he said 
he and colleagues found that in 21 games analyzed for which the 
temperature was in the 90s pitchers racked up an average of 057 
hit batters per game for the remainder of the total 215 games in 
the study the highest average for cooler weather was 033 for 
games played in the 80s lower rates were found for games at lower 
temperatures 
mantell suggested that one strategy for coping with the heat is 
to spend some time alone and take an occasional break from lifes 
stresses 
during a heat wave you dont want to be a workaholic he 
said 
your thinking can be an internal thermometer to lower the 
temperature to what it is outside instead of what youve 
exaggerated it to he said 
parents should distract their children from focusing on the 
heat and they should model a cool mental attitude for the children 
to see he said 
a good line of approach is boy it sure is hot it sure is 
uncomfortable but it will pass i can tolerate it mantell 
said 
james rotton a psychologist at florida international university 
in north miami recommended drinking plenty of water rather than 
alcohol alcohol tends to unleash aggression in hot weather he 
said 
studies have given strong evidence that hot weather promotes 
assaults between acquaintances homicides and rape he said in a 
telephone interview 
humidity amplifies the effect of heat but the main problem is 
that the body cant shed its own heat when the air is so warm he 
said 
to cope with heat as with any stress rotton recommended 
staying in good physical shape but dont overdo the exercise in 
hot weather he added 
drinking water is important because during hot weather the body 
loses water faster than people can detect through thirst he said 
the result can be heat stroke

baseball batters get hit by pitches more often 
when the temperature is in the 90s maybe because the heat is 
making pitchers more aggressive a study released saturday suggests 
its not so much that the beanballs are deliberate but rather 
the pitchers may be trying to move batters back from the plate 
said researcher alan reifman 
establishing dominance by throwing close to the batter could be 
taken as an aggressive act prodded by discomfort from the heat he 
said 
you might plan to throw it close and your aim is a little 
off he said 
but reifman a graduate student at the university of michigan at 
ann arbor stressed that merely finding a relationship between hot 
weather and the risk of beanballs does not prove causeandeffect 
he presented his work at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association 
he and colleagues found that in the 21 games analyzed for which 
the temperature was in the 90s pitchers racked up an average of 
057 hit batters per game 
for the remainder of the total 215 games in the study the 
highest average for cooler weather was 033 for games played in 
the 80s lower rates were found for games at lower temperatures 
the analysis was based on statistics from every tenth major 
league game played in 1986 as listed in the los angeles times 
the analysis did not account for night games but it did 
statistically remove the influence of pitcher inaccuracy as 
measured by the number of walks in the game and possibility of 
throwing beanballs as retribution as suggested by the number of 
home runs hit by the opposing team 
william fox who teaches about motivation and behavior within 
organizations at the university of florida in gainesville called 
the work preliminary but interesting 
like a lot of research its a first cut its provocative it 
points to the need to do more research he said

to a half dozen or so names im not saying whom im going to run 
with was the vice presidents comment in an interview with cable 
news network 
the roster was said to include two former rivals for the gop 
nomination sen bob dole of kansas and jack kemp of new york also

the list 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis interrupted a 
weekend on cape cod for a news conference that included a tribute 
to bushs enormous courage and tremendous patriotism a day 
earlier bushs account of being shot down in world war ii was 
questioned by a gunner who witnessed the episode 
at the same time he renewed his attack on reagan 
administrations irresponsible fiscal policy in the wake of 
last weeks jump in interest rates 
with bush in washington pondering his choices and polishing his 
acceptance speech republicans spent the preconvention weekend 
lighting up the social circuit 
there were 500 separate conventionrelated receptions 
breakfasts luncheons dinners brunches and cocktail parties on 
the docket for the week by rough count not to mention the tourist 
attractions that make new orleans famous 
we had a few delegates come in they had their badges on 
said manny moreland the doorman at a club in the fabled french 
quarter where female impersonators dance nearly naked from new 
york good tippers 
a youthful republican balloon squad worked overtime inflating 
enough red white and blue balloons for next weeks celebration 
construction crews put the finishing touches on the superdome 
podium where bush will stand to deliver his acceptance speech next 
thursday night 
police reported that 25 groups had signed up to stage protests 
in a designated area several blocks from the convention arena the 
list ran the gamut from selfproclaimed anarchists to marijuana 
smokers to advocates from the homeless 
local politicians worked to take advantage of the publicity 
glare focused on new orleans democratic mayor sidney j barthemey 
said he hoped people will leave here and will have a positive 
view of the city if they already didnt have one 
the vice presidential guessing game was the only suspense at the 
gop convention and one bush aide said the campaign would start 
floating a lot of trial balloons starting monday the rumor mill 
is going to be fantastic said steve schwartz executive director 
of the north carolina campaign organization 
already the speculation had drifted into sarcasmland one 
republican showed off a bushrather button as if bush might 
pick the cbs anchorman with whom he had an onair showdown during 
the primary season 
with bush several hundred miles away in washington the 
republican high command worked the convention city

his weekly radio address that he will campaign for the vice 
president this fall because of my love for america and my dreams 
for her future 
some in the other party are parading around the country 
talking and talking about what they claim theyd do if they were 
elected well while they talk we deliver he said 
republican chairman frank fahrenkopf said the party hoped to 
maintain the interest of the prime time audience throughout the 
week the convention will be a success he said if we can 
maintain a program that keeps the american people watching to an 
extent greater than the democrats had and we get out those 
messages a comparison of what it was like what the democrats are 
really all about with michael dukakis and our vision for the 
future 
roughing up dukakis was on the agenda as well massachusetts 
republicans were coming to town with a videotape attacking the 
democratic candidate he talks about things puts a nice spin on 
them but the facts are quite different said ray shamie head of 
the state party 
democrats were doing a little roughing up of their own vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen called the republican party 
platform a repeat of broken promises from the eight years of 
the reagan administration 
campaigning in kingsville in his home state of texas bentsen 
said theyve got a balanced budget amendment in that platform 
a balanced budget amendment remember that in 1980 they had it in 
84

states congress not yet not one he said

the us navy has begun cutting back its 
persian gulf force by dropping plans to send another sophisticated 
aegis cruiser to the region 
although other deployments may go ahead as planned us 
military sources say the move indicates that senior american 
officials are confident that an aug 20 ceasefire between iraq and 
iran will succeed clearing the way for a promised reduction of the 
american naval commitment here 
by a process of attrition the 27ship force could be trimmed 
considerably by the end of october although probably not to the 
level of three four or five ships mentioned by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci in a statement last week the sources 
said 
to bring it to that size about where it was last year when the 
american naval buildup began would mean removing the 11ship 
carrier battle group in the arabian sea and almost twothirds of 
the 16 ships now in the gulf 
six of the ships in the gulf are mine sweepers whose presence 
may be required indefinitely according to senior us officers 
they say a couple of hundred mines are still in the waterway 
first word of the reduction came when navy sources disclosed 
that fridays scheduled departure of the aegistype cruiser mobile 
bay from its home port at mayport florida was being temporarily 
postponed 
pentagon spokesmen said the 9600ton mobile bay which had been 
marked to replace its sister ship vincennes in the gulf region 
would remain in the united states while us officials reevaluated 
the situation in the waterway 
cmdr mel sundin a pentagon spokesman said a final decision on 
the mobile bay will depend on an ongoing assessment of what level 
of forces are needed to ensure continued and unimpeded operations 
in the gulf 
the military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that meant the ship would head for the gulf only if the 
unsponsored ceasefire collapsed and a new flareup endangered 
the navys escort operations 
cmdr mark baker a navy spokesman at the pentagon said 
saturday the navy had no change in plans to deploy four other 
warships scheduled to leave the east coast for gulf duty this week 
he was clarifying a friday news report that quoted a pentagon 
statement as saying a decision was not made on the deployment 
the ships include the missile cruiser josephus daniels based at 
norfolk va and the missile frigates taylor aubrey fitch and 
doyle the taylor is based at charleston sc and the other two 
at mayport 
barring a change of orders they would replace other ships now 
serving in the gulf the present flotilla includes six vessels due 
to leave by late september 
the vincennes which arrrived in the region may 22 will depart 
for san diego early next month us officials said some observers 
speculated that it might leave sooner because of the uproar over 
its attack on an iranian jetliner on july 3 killing all 290 
aboard the navy said the crew mistook the jet for an attacking 
iranian fighter 
a us officer said however that ship movements are always 
flexible within a certain range and the vincennes schedule would 
give time to determine whether the ceasefire would work 
a decision not to replace the vincennes with another of the 
navys billiondollar aegis cruisers would reverse a major tactical 
decision that backfired on us officials 
gen george b crist commander of us central command said 
june 1 that the billiondollar cruiser one of the navys most 
sophisticated warships was sent to the gulf with multiple 
missions they included monitoring a new iranian antiship missile 
site in the strait of hormuz and allowing overworked us warships 
to have more time in port 
a month later the vincennes shot down the iran air a300 
airbus the ship was pulled off duty for two weeks during an 
investigation of the incident by a team of us officers then left 
the gulf for the arabian sea and has not reentered the waterway 
some critics questioned why a warship designed to protect a 
fleet over hundreds of miles of open sea was assigned to the gulf 
where the primary threats were mines small gunboats and aircraft 
operating at short range 
the investigators in a report now being studied at the 
pentagon blamed human error in the heat of combat for the 
incident according to defense department officials in washington 
military officers have said the united states could reduce its 
forces in the gulf partly by canceling deployment of ships slated 
to replace those already performing escort duty for kuwaiti tankers 
the united states middle east force which has operated in the 
gulf since the late 1940s had six ships when the operation began 
in july 1987 it since has kept up to three times that many in the 
gulf and about ten more outside to provide air support

west german protesters threw tomatoes and eggs at 
east german guards at the berlin wall and communist police hauled 
away protesting east german youths saturday as both sides marked 
the barriers 27th anniversary 
west berlin politicians and peace groups lay wreaths during 
solemn ceremonies at memorials for the 77 east germans reported 
killed in escape attempts to the west 
west german newspapers condemned the wall with one of them 
calling it a monstrosity 
but communist east germanys statecontrolled newspapers 
celebrated the walls construction and said it contributed to 
eastwest peace 
dozens of west german activists demonstrated in front of the 
brandenburg gate a stone gateway directly behind the wall in the 
eastern sector they carried lifesized portraits of mikhail s 
gorbachev and called on the soviet leader to pressure east germany 
to tear down the wall 
in its evening broadcast west germanys zdf television network 
showed a handful of east german youths being taken away by east 
berlin police after trying to protest near the wall the protest 
appeared to have been dispersed peacefully 
about a dozen young people from west berlin protested late 
friday night at the checkpoint charlie control point between 
east and west berlin witnesses said hurling tomatoes and eggs at 
guards on the eastern side 
the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
demonstrators left peacefully after british military police were 
called in 
east german border guards began hastily constructing the 13foot 
wall on aug 13 1961 dividing the city into eastern and western 
halves orders to construct the wall came as the rising flow of 
east german refugees to the west threatened to cripple the 
communist nations economy 
the official east german explanation for the wall was that it 
was needed to prevent a planned attack from the west 
the east german youth newspaper junge welt said in its saturday 
editions the wall was built because those who oppose fascism once 
promised no more wars from german territory 
another east german newspaper berliner zeitung said of the day 
construction began as the day dawned the border was made safe 
west german commentators sharply denounced the wall 
people who are in their 30s have grown up with this 
monstrosity the berliner morgenpost newspaper said it belongs 
to their everyday lives but the wall is still a horror in a 
civilized world 
the wall is also a test for the true value of gorbachevs 
reforms the newspaper said as long as this monstrosity is 
standing gorbachevs words are only words 
another west german newspaper the masscirculation daily bild 
said in a commentary today 27 years later we speak of new 
openness and reforms in the east but the wall still stands 
inhumanity cast in stone bondage poured into cement 
in washington on friday president reagan called the berlin wall 
dramatic proof of communisms failed dream 
aug 13 marks a sad anniversary reagan said in a statement 
that wall is a both a scar across the city of berlin and a symbol 
of the division of the german nation and of europe 
today armed east german guards patrol the wall around the 
clock and floodlights illuminate it at night 
the august 13th working group a west berlin organization that 
monitors human rights in east germany says 77 people have been 
killed in escape attempts from east berlin since the wall was put 
up 
the last reported death came on may 23 1987 when a lifeless 
body was carried away from the wall on the east berlin side

half of the estimated 100000 soviet 
forces in afghanistan pulled out by saturday two days ahead of a 
deadline set by a un peace pact afghanistans staterun radio 
said 
radio kabul said a red army unit crossed the oxus river saturday 
into soviet territory to bring the withdrawal to the halfway point 
the report monitored in islamabad quoted maj gen rauli 
helminen of finland as saying the pullout is being completed 
according to the schedule of an accord signed april 14 in geneva 
helminen leads a un observation team 
us officials in islamabad earlier said it was likely that 
50000 red army soldiers would withdraw by the aug 15 target date 
three months after the withdrawal began 
the soviets entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help 
afghanistans communist government battle the usbacked 
guerrillas the soviet pullout is to be completed by feb 15 under 
the geneva accord 
the guerrillas are not a party to the agreement and many 
analysts predicted in april that the insurgents would recapture 
afghan cities as fast as they were handed over to government 
security forces 
but latest reports indicate almost all 30 provincial capitals 
remain in communist hands 
our aim is to take the provincial capitals but not at the cost 
of innocent lives azim nasserzia a spokesman of the 
sevenparty afghan resistance alliance said saturday the 
guerrillas are also known as mujahedeen or holy warriors 
unconfirmed reports said combined guerrilla forces overran most 
of the northern provincial capital of kunduz after soviet troops 
moved out in the first week of august 
sources also said about 8000 guerrillas are preparing to attack 
about 7000 government forces defending the southeastern city of 
kandahar an ancient provincial capital 
guerrillas have seized three other provincial capitals since may 
15 but abandoned them days later under heavy soviet aerial 
bombardment 
on saturday radio kabul said 13 people died in a rocket attack 
on the eastern city of gardez about 60 miles southeast of kabul 
it said the attack occurred friday but another broadcast said it 
happened saturday 
no one claimed responsibility but the radio blamed the 
guerrillas 
the radio also said 27 extremist opposition elements 
presumably referring to guerrillas were killed in an attack friday 
in the western province of herat 
many guerrilla leaders cautioned at the start of the soviet 
withdrawal that key cities probably would not fall until the 
ninemonth pullout was completed 
when the russians are gone then we can get what we really 
need and that is the peoples support azim said we have many 
afghan military people saying if you start something then we 
will join you 
pakistani officials western diplomats and guerrillas report 
hundreds to thousands of afghan communists have defected to the 
resistance since may 15 both sides claim about 100000 soldiers in 
the field 
in the afghan capital of kabul president najib has released 
proposals for national reconciliation but his peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan is divided into three factions even if it was 
united it would represent only a fraction of the traditionally 
decentralized afghans 
under the geneva accord washington and moscow agreed to 
continue arming their afghan clients until the other side stopped 
soviet forces have left behind vast amounts of military hardware 
and ammunition for the afghan army some of which has been captured 
by the guerrillas 
kabul has filed 69 complaints that pakistan violated the accord 
by continuing to allow guerrilla weaponry most of which is 
ussupplied through pakistan to afghanistan 
un observers have failed to find evidence backing kabuls 
claim pakistans president gen mohammed zia ulhaq denies 
knowledge of us weapons supplies 
zia in an interview to pakistani newspaper editors published 
saturday predicted kabul would fall to the rebels in two three 
or six months but said it was difficult to predict 
it is a question of how many more sacrifices afghan mujahedeen 
will be willing to make and if they are willing to pay any price 
for their freedom zia said

a soviet historian says his late father a member 
of josef stalins government should be forgiven for not opposing 
the dictators purges because he would have been killed and could 
not have helped his country 
sergo mikoyans appeal on behalf of former politburo member 
anastas i mikoyan titled repentance and redemption appeared 
saturday in the cultural newspaper sovietskaya kultura the elder 
mikoyan died in 1978 
the younger mikoyan a historian has written articles in the 
soviet press supporting soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign to come to terms with stalins legacy the dictator who 
dominated the soviet government from the 1920s until his death in 
1953 ordered millions of people killed or imprisoned in his 
article mikoyan appeared to be clearing his father of possible 
guilt in stalins purges 
mikoyan could not help but realize that he shared direct 
political responsibility for the establishment of stalins absolute 
power and consequently for spreading over the country a regime of 
lawlessness the younger mikoyan wrote 
however the historian added for many the hour of the great 
redemption has come 
he said it was clear that stalin had support including that of 
his father in carrying out his acts of repression but he said 
the support was obtained through blackmail either join the team or 
be purged often violently 
mikoyan recalled that at a 1937 communist party meeting his 
father was appointed to draft a resolution condemning nikolai 
bukharin a close associate of vladimir i lenin who led the 1917 
revolution that brought the communists to power 
the historian suggests that his father agreed to the fatal 
resolution because it already had been prepared he had no choice 
but to go up to the rostrum or down into the grave bukharin 
was shot to death in 1938 
stalin later banished mikoyan an armenian to the armenian 
capital of yerevan for communion with repression the historian 
wrote 
mikoyan considered suicide his son recalled but decided 
against it to spare his wife and children from suffering because of 
their ties to a disgraced enemy of the people 
instead mikoyan decided to devote his energy to working within 
the system in helping the people by building socialism and 
modernizing soviet industry the historian wrote 
the elder mikoyan was named foreign trade commissioner and 
insisted that the secret police keep away from workers he 
supervised they were spared from waiting for a nighttime ring at 
the door the younger mikoyan wrote 
the elder mikoyan according to the historian also intervened 
to spare the lives of his friends condemned under stalins purges 
after stalins death mikoyan and nikita s khrushchev alone 
pushed for full condemnation of the dictator and rehabilitation of 
his victims the historian said in defense of his father 
in 1956 mikoyan gave a speech condemning stalins cult of 
personality and was also instrumental in staving off an attempt 
to oust khrushchev from the soviet leadership a year later mikoyan 
wrote 
for all this he wrote his father should be praised 
what choices he asked did his father have to perish as an 
enemy of the people and be posthumously rehabilitated or to 
survive to rehabilitate the living and dead finally to do 
something that would help the renewal of the society even in our 
times

a computer and radar similar to the type used by 
highway patrolmen to clock speeders can be used to warn pilots of 
deadly but invisible wind bursts that have sent airplanes into 
crashes tests here have shown 
conditions called wind shear and microburst have killed nearly 
500 american air travelers and injured more than 200 others in the 
past 23 years according to federal government figures 
but a twomonth test at denvers stapleton airport of the 
terminal doppler weather radar system has already enabled flight 
controllers to warn jet crews of wind shear conditions 
on july 11 alone five jetliners on landing approach were 
diverted by air traffic controllers after an automatic warning by 
the tdwr computer system 
the wind shears could have made the aircraft plunge out of 
control said cleon biter the national center for atmospheric 
researchs project manager in the program 
a wind shear is any abrupt change in wind speed and direction 
while a microburst is a powerful downward rush of air from a 
cumulus cloud that strikes the ground and spreads out in all 
directions creating wind shear conditions 
abrupt changes in wind speed or direction pose extreme danger to 
aircraft which get their lift from air rushing across the wing if 
air speed across the wing sharply falls off the wing loses lift 
and the plane falls 
an airplane flying into a microburst momentarily experiences 
increased air speed when it meets the air rushing outward but on 
the other side of the microburst the air is speeding away from the 
plane causing a sharp drop in airspeed across the wing surfaces 
and loss of lift 
if the plane has enough altitude it can recover if it is 
landing or taking off it may plunge to the ground 
the search for a way to detect the conditions was intensified 
after major crashes such as the crash at dallasfort worth on aug 
2 1985 that killed 137 when a delta plane flying out of a 
microburst was unable to stay aloft 
the federal aviation administration is funding the radar test 
in which the national weather service the massachusetts institute 
of technology and the university of north dakota also are 
participating the test ends aug 31 
the demonstration tests are the latest in several faabacked 
doppler radar projects done at stapleton to develop an early 
warning system for wind shear said donald turnbull the faas 
project manager in washington dc 
the highway patrol uses a doppler radar gun to measure your 
speed in a car were using the same technique to check the 
velocity of air said dr wayne sand ncars deputy manager of 
research applications 
doppler radar can see well up into the clouds and try to 
determine the formation of microbursts doppler can look out to 
about 40 miles were concentrating within an area of six miles of 
the airport the prime area for wind detection but were looking 
out 40 miles to see approaching wind gusts turnbull said 
when the 3 million prototype systems computer decides the 
radar has seen a wind shear or microburst it tells air traffic 
controllers at stapleton who warn pilots he said 
turnbull said officials hope contracts for 47 of the units will 
be awarded by the middle of october and be on line at major 
airports by 1992 because contract bidding is under way turnbull 
would not give cost estimates but earlier reports have put the 
unit price at 55 million 
the new system would replace the older low level wind shear 
alert system consisting of several groundmounted anemometers 
placed around airports to measure surface wind velocity and 
direction

a man who pleaded guilty in connection 
with an elaborate scheme to sell stolen computer plans to the 
soviet union has been sentenced to six years in federal prison 
kevin anderson 30 pleaded guilty in may to conspiracy to 
violate export laws and wire fraud in a plea bargain that 
apparently required his testimony against his alleged 
coconspirator charles mcvey he had faced a maximum of 15 years 
mcvey is awaiting extradition from canada for his role in the 
failed caper involving 4 million worth of technology manuals and 
programs from the saxpy corp of sunnyvale 
prosecutors had sought a sentence of 12 years for anderson 
citing the cases extraordinary seriousness 
but us district judge william ingram said at fridays 
sentencing he was mainly concerned about the theft of materials 
from saxpy and less about the purported danger to national security 
posed by the 1987 scheme which was never completed 
because of the saxpy computers capabilities in antisubmarine 
warfare the case threatened national security prosecutors 
contended 
the american computer technology involved in this case is 
among the most sophisticated and highly sought after by the soviet 
bloc the us department of commerce said in a statement issued 
friday 
the documents and programs stolen from saxpy would have 
allowed the soviets to use this technology in antisubmarine 
warfare applicatons if the shipments were successful it would 
have been a major blow to our national security 
defense attorneys charged that federal officials had hyped 
charges in the case saying they claimed anderson had stolen the 
crown jewels of technology when it was really rhinestones at 
best 
david ellison one of andersons attorneys said that with 
credit for time served anderson could be free in 18 months

a federal judge sentenced a drug dealer 
to 15 years in prison but offered to reduce the sentence by one 
month for every user or dealer he revealed to prosecutors 
in order to qualify for the reduction federal prosecutors must 
be able to verify that the names given to them are those of actual 
dealers or users 
us district judge joseph e stevens jr said after the 
sentencing friday that he intended to stir up concern among users 
about whether theyre really safe doing what theyre doing 
the defendant alfred griffin 57 pleaded guilty on may 2 to 
using western union wire transfers to conceal money sent to 
california to buy drugs for kansas city drug houses 
federal marshals took griffin who had been free on bond into 
custody he said nothing during the hearing 
its a vey unusual sentence griffins lawyer bruce simon 
said afterward i think its very bizarre frankly i have some 
serious problems with it 
simon said his client did not indicate immediately whether he 
would reveal sources considering the danger it might pose for him 
in court earlier simon told the judge that imposing a harsh 
sentence would not work as a deterrent to dealers 
theres just not enough likelihood of getting caught simon 
said 
stevens said he devised the sentencing idea on the spot 
ive been concerned about effective sentencing in the drug 
cases for a long time stevens said 
within 120 days the judge will review whether griffin has 
provided names of verifiable drug traffickers or users stevens 
said he would then trim one month for each name

limpet mine and pushed people out of the area when they ignored her 
warnings they also lauded moses biyela who said his white 
supervisor disappeared after ordering him to place a bomb 
suppression blanket over the object 
biyela 32 suffered severe burns and lacerations when the bomb 
exploded three feet in front of him before he could place the 
blanket he was holding the blanket in front of his body which may 
have saved his life

suddenly i was all alone people were fleeing all around me 
the security chief who ordered him to put the blanket on the 
plasticwrapped parcel had disappeared i was very very 
scared

here is a text of president reagans radio 
address saturday 
my fellow americans this coming week the republican national 
convention will take place in new orleans the 32nd such convention 
since the grand old party first met in 1856 
i want to talk about that convention in just a moment but first 
id like to tell you a little about whats been taking place here 
at the white house in the past few days and you should know i 
have a special reason for wanting to do so 
you see in this campaign season some in the other party are 
parading around the country talking and talking about what they 
claim theyd do if they were elected well while they talk we 
deliver 
to begin with i recently vetoed the defense bill that congress 
had sent me why because congress perhaps taking their cue from 
the other partys leadership laid on my desk a bill that would 
have set back our nations defenses severely i wont stand for 
that neither will george bush 
now its up to congress to come up with a new bill one that 
strengthens our defenses instead of weakening them and strengthens 
our hand still further in dealing with the soviets 
still on foreign affairs were seeking from congress effective 
aid for the freedom fighters in nicaragua in recent weeks the 
communist regime in nicaragua the regime the freedom fighters are 
opposing has stalled the arias peace plan expelled the american 
ambassador to nicaragua shut down the independent press and 
brutally suppressed a peaceful protest 
regarding nicaragua the leadership of the other party advocates 
policies of disengagement and unconcern policies that would surely 
permit the communists to consolidate their power indeed the would 
permit a communist lock on a nation right here in our own 
hemisphere 
george bush and i happen to disagree with them its our firm 
belief that in nicaragua the united states has a high moral duty 
a duty to stand for human liberty and to extend our help to those 
who are struggling to secure it 
turning to matters here at home we saw the passage this past 
week of an important fair housing bill george bush and i have 
supported stronger fair housing measures from the first and i 
look forward to signing the measure 
on wednesday i signed legislation that compensates japanese 
americans who were wrongly interned during the second world war 
and on thursday i signed into law the largest disaster relief bill 
in our history drought legislation that will help the tens of 
thousands of american farmers who are suffering from this summers 
terrible shortage of rain 
so while the other party talks about compassion we put it into 
action were also working on important legislation involving trade 
and in this connection i might as well admit that the leadership 
of the other party has my irish up you see they talk as if the 
country were in some kind of recession if not an outright 
depression 
but the truth is just the opposite since george bush and i put 
our economic policies in place weve witnessed the longest 
peacetime expansion in american history an expansion that has 
created over 175 million jobs 
now the vice president and i are determined to go still further 
opening america and all the world to still greater trade and 
economic growth 
this past week we saw the implementing legislation for the 
uscanada free trade agreement move closer to final congressional 
approval and congress has passed a trade bill one that more 
closely reflects bushs and my emphasis on world trade that is both 
free and yes fair 
so you see while the leadership of the other party have been 
talking george bush and i have been hard at work putting into 
practice the ideals you believe in the ideals that at our heart 
america has always stood for strong defenses low taxes and 
limited government compassion and fair play like that embodied in 
the fair housing bill faith in our future and an openness to the 
rest of the world as demonstrated in our trade legislation 
and yes those are just the ideals youll hear us republicans 
rededicating ourselves to this coming week in new orleans 
you know ill be addressing the republican convention on 
monday the opening night and taking an active role in the coming 
campaign but even so my name wont appear on any ballot this 
fall whats at stake for me in this election is my love for 
america and my dreams for her future 
and thats what my support for vice president bush comes down 
to you see george bush understands that the question for america 
today is not whats different but whats next until next week 
god bless you

a group of conservative republicans led by 
sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire threatened saturday to put 
up their own candidate for vice president if george bush fails to 
select a running mate acceptable to them 
humphreys group coalition for a winning ticket is trying to 
exert pressure for a conservative running mate to balance a ticket 
headed by bush the fact is the conservatives are not turned on 
by the bush candidacy he said 
we did not come here to act as rubber stamps for the party 
hierarchy humphrey said at a news conference we want to be 
given a stake 
he said his group is telephoning members of the state 
delegations to this weeks republican national convention to find 
out if there is support for entering an alternative vice 
presidential choice into nomination should bush pick a moderate 
humphrey said there is support from three or four delegations 
that have assured us that they are willing to follow our 
leadership for such a move 
the conservatives are gearing up for a rules fight to block a 
potential move by the bush campaign to prevent a vote for anyone 
other than the bushanointed running mate choice at the convention 
humphrey said 
on friday bush operatives got a change through the rules 
committee that would dispense with the roll call vote if there were 
only one vice presidential candidate in contention that change 
would have to be voted on by the convention to take effect 
some republicans such as humphrey contend bush is not a 
conservative in the reagan tradition 
of the six vice presidential possibilities that a key bush 
adviser listed as being on a short list in the runningmate 
considerations humphrey said only two would be acceptable rep 
jack kemp of new york and sen dan quayle of indiana 
sen bob dole of kansas said humphrey is not a hardliner 
against new taxes and doles wife former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole has never run for office and might need onthejob 
training both doles along with sens alan simpson of wyoming 
and pete domenici of new mexico are said to be on bushs short 
list 
of the people who have at some point been suggested as running 
mate possibilities humphrey said his group would be satisfied with 
education secretary william bennett new hampshire gov john 
sununu colorado sen william armstrong and rep henry hyde of 
illinois 
but were not trying to force anyone down anyones throat we 
think there are a lot of good people who have been talked about at 
one time or another that fit the bill 
bush infuriated some conservatives by selecting moderate new 
jersey gov thomas kean to deliver the keynote speech monday night 
kean does not support the hardliners antiabortion positions 
humphrey said that in the end he will support the gop ticket 
regardless but he said of other conservatives if theyre not 
turned on get a real middle of the road establishment 
republican a lot of these people are not going to be enthused and 
i think theyll take a walk

nearly six weeks after the presidential 
election crowds still shout president at opposition leader 
cuauhtemoc cardenas who shows few signs of conceding defeat to the 
party that has been in power for 59 years 
his leftofcenter movement and other opposition groups continue 
an intense war of words for the public trust with the governing 
institutional revolutionary party 
it would be dangerous to ignore it or scorn it or to minimize 
it octavio paz one of mexicos most prominent writers said in 
an essay published last week 
cardenas the son of one of mexicos most beloved presidents 
has crossed the nation since the election claiming he defeated 
governing party candidate carlos salinas de gortari in the july 6 
elections and calling on people to defend the vote from alleged 
fraud 
he is drawing crowds despite virtually no coverage by 
progovernment television stations most newspapers continue to 
publish reports about his crusade 
the country identifies the future with cardenas and salinas 
with the past said jorge castanada a prominent political 
analyst 
although in control and saluted by world leaders as the winner 
the governing party known as the pri is clearly worried 
salinas still is certain to be inaugurated on dec 1 to a 
sixyear term succeeding president miguel de la madrid but the 
party has promised internal reforms and offered to negotiate with 
the opposition 
cardenas rejected negotiations 
there is only one path and that is the law cardenas 54 
told the associated press in an interview thursday we arent 
going to have any negotiations or any alliance that implies 
recognition of someone who didnt win the july 6 elections 
the governing party claimed victory before results came in 
after a weeklong delay in announcing results the pridominated 
federal election commission said the pri won 
on monday the chamber of deputies acting as the electoral 
college begins examining the disputed returns and vote fraud 
charges its formal declaration of a president is expected by early 
september 
cardenas and the candidate of the rightist national action 
party manuel clouthier have called for nationwide demonstrations 
sunday on the eve of the session both have vocal allies on the 
electoral board 
cardenas said peoples lives will improve once they have a say 
in how the country is run they must continue to insist peacefully 
and through legal means for clean elections and genuine democracy 
he said 
whether the pri will reform and whether salinas a 40yearold 
former planning and budget minister can fulfill a promise to 
restructure mexicos economy without a national consensus remains 
to be seen 
cardenas says mexico could become hard to govern if democratic 
reforms dont take place 
what are they going to do if people rise up and do not 
recognize authorities which committed electoral fraud he 
asked this is something the government and the pri should 
reflect on 
but he said he does not expect bloodshed the people are 
acting with a lot of sensitivity and with a lot of maturity no 
one wants violence in mexico 
until this year the governing party had never lost a senate 
seat and it had won every presidential race with at least 70 
percent of the vote the party has yet to lose a governorship the 
cardenas coalition plans to field candidates in the two 
gubernatorial races at stake later this year 
cardenas insists that a clean electoral college count will 
probably show him the winner and give his coalition at least 10 of 
the senates 64 seats instead of the four the election commission 
claimed 
he also says that if the electoral college doesnt toss out 
fraudtainted returns and make public the results from each polling 
place it should call a new election 
neither is considered likely 
the commission has yet to reveal tallies from 25000 of the 
nations 55000 polling places but it says its overall count shows 
salinas won with 5036 percent it says cardenas finished second 
with 3112 percent and clouthier trailed with 1707 percent 
as for the pridominated election complaint tribunal it has 
rejected about 90 percent of nearly 600 fraud charges 
the outcome of the electoral college session may be virtually 
certain but it wont perform what was once a mere formality 
without public notice

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen on saturday called the republican party platform a 
repeat of broken promises from eight years of the reagan 
administration 
the texas senator in a speech to supporters at texas a amp i 
university said hes been watching whats been going on at that 
republican convention what theyre talking about in that 
platform 
and from what ive heard of it thus far its just a repeat of 
some of the broken promises we heard in 1980 and back in 1984 he 
said 
the republican platform committee held meetings in new orleans 
last week and the partys national convention begins there monday 
night 
theyve got a balanced budget amendment in that platform he 
said remember that in 1980 they had it in 84 
and they havent submitted a balanced budget yet to the united 
states congress not yet not one he said michael dukakis as 
governor of massachusetts has introduced and passed ten balanced 
budgets in a row 
bentsen said the gop delegates are really not in touch with 
the working men and women of america 
they did a poll and found that over 80 percent of them didnt 
want any funding of day care he said now the vast majority 
of the american people understand the need for it 
bentsen press secretary mike mccurry said the senator was 
referring to a poll of republican delegates conducted by cnn and 
usa today 
bentsen is on nineday campaign trip aimed at preventing an 
erosion of democratic support in his home state polls conducted 
after the democratic convention last month showed that texas would 
give its 29 electoral votes to the democrats dukakis is scheduled 
to join bentsen at the end of the trip and the campaign has bought 
television ads to coincide with the effort 
vice president george bush the certain republican nominee also 
claims texas as his home and has been courting the state too 
bush is moving more campaign operations there and has hinted 
that the texas delegation at the gop convention might be the first 
to find out his choice for a running mate 
is texas important to this campaign you bet it is bentsen 
said saturday 
bentsen who has said he received 90 percent of the states 
hispanic vote in his last senate campaign in 1982 told reporters 
friday night he doubts that president reagans appointment of lauro 
f cavazos of texas tech university as the new secretary of 
education would help bush 
that was so apparent i dont think it will have any 
influence he said as far as getting any political mileage out 
of it i dont think it will a threemonth appointment is not 
going to be that impressive to hispanics 
the senator had a full schedule of south texas events saturday 
including stops in laredo and brownsville he planned to spend 
saturday night and most of sunday relaxing at his fathers ranch in 
mcallen before heading to houston for more campaigning 
in laredo bentsen spoke on local economic issues before the 
border trade alliance a group that promotes better business 
relations between the us and mexico 
weve got to find ways to speed up the flow of people and 
goods between mexico and the us he said but we need more 
than a bill board on our side and a factory on the other side

an uneasy peace long prevailed on manhattans 
lower east side an ethnic melting pot for generations while the 
dopers and drunks homeless and homesteaders yippies and yuppies 
moved in 
but then the police arrived one night and all hell broke loose 
it was like downtown beirut a store owner who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said after he watched about 400 police and 
450 protesters battle last weekend over a curfew at tompkins square 
park leaving 52 people hurt 14 of them police officers 
a week later the focus is on the actions of police more than 
80 complaints of police brutality have been filed and us 
attorney rudolph giuliani is investigating whether police violated 
the civilians civil rights 
mayor edward i koch and police commissioner benjamin ward 
initially defended police but reversed field after watching 
videotapes of officers swinging billy clubs with abandon covering 
their badge numbers and trampling people with their horses 
koch also lifted the curfew and ordered the park left open 
overnight although an 11 pm noise curfew has been enforced and 
in an effort to reduce policecivilian tensions citizen observers 
are joining officers on patrols 
the area around the park known as the east village has had 
deep divisions and frictions 
the neighborhoods mix has been heady germans ukrainians 
russians hungarians greeks poles and italians then blacks then 
hispanics and more recently indians and koreans they have been 
joined by the downandout by 60s burnouts and by upwardly mobile 
young professionals renovating old buildings 
to the west of the park are vestiges of the ukrainian and polish 
communities that once flourished coffee shops churches a 
community center clusters of elderly women speaking their native 
tongue 
along st marks place is a hippiepunk fusion vendors set up 
wares on the sidewalk in front of boutiques galleries and poster 
shops within a block you can choose from soy burgers pizza 
sushi or some sabzee chalow at an afghan place 
the riot wasnt caused by this bizarre blend but the 
neighborhood with its history of radicalism and tolerance for the 
unconventional was fertile ground for such a clash 
police said they began enforcing a 1 am curfew at the request 
of some residents who complained of noise from rowdies who hang out 
in the park which is also a drug marketplace and a dormitory for 
the homeless 
but then some witnesses said the police were greeted by a 
handful of malcontents throwing bottles 
tv stations showed videotape of the ensuing violence including 
one officer repeatedly swinging a nightstick at the man holding the 
camera 
many park regulars and poor residents believe the city and 
police are in league with real estate developers to clear the area 
of undesirables and attract more affluent tenants 
they claim abandoned buildings are left empty by landlords 
awaiting gentrification and higher rents the better ones are 
rehabilitated and filled with white uppermiddle class tenants 
they say 
its hard to say what the bigger problem is the lack of 
housing or drugs said tom brasuell 28 a lifelong resident who 
is an administrative assistant to councilwoman miriam friedlander 
poorer people are definitely getting squeezed out while people 
are doubled up in projects 
on the east side of tompkins square park the housing 
deteriorates noticeably 
walk through and you will find hundreds of buildings that have 
been vacant for the last 10 to 15 years said angel rodriguez 
who runs a youth program in the area 
but some buildings that were fixed up now offer apartments that 
rent for 1000 to 3000 a month or sell for hundreds of thousands 
of dollars 
hundreds of people live in seemingly deserted shells the legal 
ones paying the city rent while fixing up the property are 
urban homesteaders others are squatters 
theres a combination of different races and economic brackets 
in a way that is very unique said michael shenker 32 a 
composer whose homestead apartment has walls stripped to the studs 
but has electricity and a phone its something that people are 
endeavoring to maintain they dont want homogenization 
it would destroy a certain poetic quality here it would also 
mean a displacement of us thats why tempers flare its not 
about race color religion its about money 
even with socalled gentrification its still cheaper than 
the upper west side and its closer to wall street said stuart 
v rubinfield whose real estate company has been in the 
neighborhood 15 years 
but its also avantgarde this is the cutting edge of the 
art scene rubinfield said its really heterogeneous from 
the media coverage you get the idea that there are 100000 people 
in gray flannel suits invading the neighborhood its just not 
happening

three environmental groups assailed the reagan 
administrations energy policy as an environmental tragedy 
saturday and called for a new strategy keyed to greater efficiency 
renewable resources and enhanced production from existing domestic 
oil fields 
they accused interior secretary donald hodel of crying wolf 
over supposed energy shortages in order to press for largescale 
oil and gas development of alaskan wilderness and environmentally 
sensitive areas off the shores of california and new england 
future generations of americans may lose priceless national 
environmental resources said the report which was prepared by 
the sierra club and endorsed by two other groups friends of the 
earth and the national audubon society 
it said the united states could lead the world in boosting 
energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources such as 
solar power 
the alternative offered by the reagan administration is not 
just an environmental tragedy but an energy disaster the groups 
said 
brooks b yeager a lobbyist for the sierra club and author of 
the report told a press briefing the administration has opposed 
obstructed and undermined virtually every congressional attempt to 
encourage greater energy efficiency or the development of renewable 
resources 
this presidential election year and the coming change to a new 
administration offers us a great opportunity to refocus our sights 
on achievable national energy goals which will significantly 
improve our overall energy security he said 
yeager praised democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
interest in energy efficiency alternatives and his opposition 
to oil and gas development in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
and off northern california 
he said republican candidate george bush has not fundamentally 
offered a new vision of energy policy the republican platform and 
vice president bushs statements seem to indicate business as 
usual 
the report called hodels energy planning record disastrous 
saying he has used the prospect of impending energy shortages to 
promote massive energy development schemes throughout his career 
an interior department spokesman david prosperi commented 
about the sierra club report from all appearances its nothing 
more than a lot of hot air 
its ironic that these individuals who accuse secretary hodel 
of crying wolf are the same ones who screamed that oil prices would 
go through the ceiling when president reagan deregulated the price 
of oil and they were the same doom sayers who predicted the demise 
of the caribou herd in alaskas prudhoe bay because of energy 
activity when in fact the caribou herd has tripled in number 
prosperi said 
yeager said the 32billionbarrel reservoir of oil said to 
underlie the arctic coastal plain is dwarfed by the billions of 
barrels of oil remaining in already exploited domestic oil 
reservoirs 
we need to encourage infill drilling and enhanced recovery 
techniques so that we can develop this resource he said 
and raising new car and light truck average efficiency standards 
from the current 26 miles per gallon to 40 mpg would save more than 
30 billion barrels of oil yeager said 
the potential for american development of both passive and 
active solar energy has hardly begun to be tapped he added 
other countries including japan are making a more serious 
effort to develop this technology

the roy high school soccer team played soccer 
so long they forgot who and where they were and at times even 
forgot how to play 
their more than 75hour effort was an attempt to get into the 
guinness book of world records for the longest soccer game ever 
played 
the team began play monday at noon seventyfive hours 30 
minutes and more than 520 goals later the players came off the 
field thursday afternoon with what they hope will hold up as a 
world record 
the official record of 74 hours is held by a team from wales 
of course theres joy and excitement at breaking the record 
but thats subsided as weve reached the moment said coach scott 
snelson who joined in the marathon so there would be 22 players 
enough for two teams now drowsiness aches and pains have taken 
over 
he said that during the ordeal the team battled fatigueinduced 
hallucinations and illness snelson said one team member tried to 
build sand castles with the dirt near one of the goals another 
imagined he was a small boy again playing with his cars and trucks 
four players dropped out but rules for the record attempt 
allowed eight players to leave the game without disqualification 
snelson said 
school officials now must document the accomplishment to have 
guinness editors confirm the record

king hussein met with plo leaders saturday 
to discuss future relations after jordans move to sever ties with 
the israelioccupied territories jordans official news agency 
said 
hussein announced two weeks ago he was ending administrative 
links with the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip where 15 
million palestinians live 
the news agency said hussein met with mahmoud abbas abdullah 
hourani and mohammed milhem all members of the palestine 
liberation organizations executive committee and hani alhassan 
a senior adviser to plo chairman yasser arafat 
the delegation presented to the king a full evaluation on the 
palestinians current situation and the plo directives following 
jordans recent measures to sever legal and administrative ties 
with the west bank the agency said 
it also said the plos recent actions enhanced the 
organizations role worldwide and gave it an international 
prominence 
the agency said the king explained to the delegation the 
national motives and considerations of the jordanian moves and the 
stable position of this country toward the palestinian issue 
no details on the positions of the two sides were given 
hussein said he was stepping aside to give the plo 
responsibility for the west bank which he ruled from 1948 until 
the israeli military occupied it in the 1967 middle east war 
jordan had kept strong ties to the territory despite the israeli 
occupation and us officials and some israelis hoped that a joint 
jordanianpalestinian delegation could be included in future peace 
talks 
in severing ties the king halted payments to government workers 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip suspended the lower house 
of parliament with its 30 west bank representatives out of 60 and 
eliminated a ministry devoted solely to west bank affairs 
the moves gave rise to speculation that hussein might be trying 
to set up the plo for failure by inviting it to assume 
responsibilities it cannot fulfill jordan which fought a war in 
197071 to expel palestinian commandos from its territory has a 
history of strained relations with the plo 
no concrete decisions or actions were announced after saturdays 
meeting the official news agency said only that the plo delegation 
expressed the plos appreciation for the kings considerations 
and his interest in supporting the palestinian issue and the rights 
of its people

otto e passman whose 30 years in congress 
ended in scandal involving a korean businessman and allegations of 
favoritism toward associates died saturday at age 88 
he died at st francis medical center in monroe according to 
the mulhearn funeral home garland shell a family friend said 
death was due to a heart attack 
passman a gradeschool dropout who rose from poverty to become 
a successful businessman was first elected to congress from a 
largely rural district in northeastern louisiana in 1946 
the conservative democrat was the powerful chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations from 1954 to 
1976 the year he was defeated in a bid for a 16th term it was in 
that post that he developed a reputation as an outspoken opponent 
of foreign aid 
for many years he was the most popular public official in 
this part of louisiana said former gov john j mckeithen he 
was a man of great honor of great integrity and extreme loyalty 
passman survived 15 elections without serious opposition but in 
1976 he lost to fellow democrat jerry huckaby by more than 8000 
votes in the states open primary 
during that campaign passman was accused of browbeating foreign 
governments into making grain deals that benefited his associates 
he denied allegations that he used his office to pressure 
foreign governments to ship their rice on vessels owned by st john 
maritime co of california 
he was also accused of favoring the connell rice and sugar co 
of westfield nj which got a reported 680 million in contracts 
under the food for peace program in the 1970s 
passman maintained that he was doing his duty by finding foreign 
markets for american farm produce and then seeing that american 
companies profited from his efforts 
but a new york times report said passman was the largest 
beneficiary of cash payments from korean businessman tongsun park 
who was accused of buying influence in congress the times said 
passman got 190000 from park 
after leaving office passman was indicted on a variety of 
federal charges in 1978 but was acquitted 
passman was born june 27 1900 near franklinton a child of 
tenant farmers he dropped out of school at 14 eventually becoming 
a prosperous businessman as head of the passman wholesale equipment 
co a commercial refrigeration firm and passman investment co 
after service in the navy in world war ii passman won his first 
term in congress 
his battles over foreign aid and other issues made headlines 
but he denied charges that he was trying to eliminate all foreign 
aid 
they have accused me of trying to wipe out the whole 
program he once said thats not true i have been trying to 
contain it but in the next breath he said hed rather have no 
foreign aid at all than have the program that existed 
in 1960 he returned from the democratic convention describing 
himself as politically sick disgusted and announced he 
wouldnt vote for john f kennedy in 1966 he vigorously attacked 
president johnson for allegedly leading the nation into socialism 
in a 1984 interview passman said he hadnt gotten used to 
retirement 
i hate it he said i just dont like the idea of not 
doing anything 
he is survived by his wife martha passman funeral services 
were set for monday in monroe

an election is about the future about change but it is also 
about the values we will carry with us as we journey into tomorrow 
and about continuity with the best from our past 
on the threshold of a new century we live in a time of 
unprecedented technological social and cultural development and 
a rapidly emerging global economy this election will bring change 
the question is will it be change and progress with the 
republicans or change and chaos with the democrats 
americans want leadership to direct the forces of change on 
americas terms guided by american values the next stage of the 
american experiment will be a new dynamic partnership in which 
people direct government and government empowers people to solve 
their own problems and to have more choices in their lives 
in 1984 we said from freedom comes opportunity from 
opportunity comes growth from growth comes progress 
in 1988 we reaffirm that truth freedom works this is not 
sloganeering but a verifiable fact it has been abundantly 
documented during the reaganbush administration in terms of real 
jobs and real progress for individuals families and communities 
urban and rural 
defending and expanding freedom is our first priority during 
the last eight years the american people joined with the 
reaganbush administration in advancing the cause of freedom at 
home and around the world our platform reflects george bushs 
belief that military strength diplomatic resoluteness and firm 
leadership are necessary to keep our country and our allies free 
republicans know the united states is a nation of communities 
churches neighborhoods social and charitable organizations 
professional groups unions and private and voluntary organizations 
in city suburb and countryside it is we the people building 
the future in freedom 
at the very heart of this platform is our belief that the 
strength of america is its people free men and women with faith 
in god working for themselves and their families believing in the 
inestimable value of every human being from the very young to the 
very old building and sustaining communities quietly performing 
those little nameless unremembered acts of kindness and love 
that make up the best portion of our lives defending freedom 
proud of their diverse heritages 
this is what the american people do quietly patiently without 
headlines as a nation of communities every day this is the 
continuing american revolution of continuity and change 
this is the american peoples true miracle of freedom it is to 
them that we dedicate this platform

service did not instruct doctors to say as little as possible to

america again leads the world confident of our abilities proud 
of our products sure of our future the pacesetter for all 
mankind moving toward the threshold of the 21st century the 
american people are poised to fulfill their dreams to a degree 
unparalleled in human history 
our nation of communities is prosperous and free in the sixth 
year of unprecedented economic expansion more people are working 
than ever before real family income has risen inflation is tamed 
by almost any measure americans are better off than they were 
eight years ago the reagan revolution has become a republican 
renaissance our countrys back back in business and back on top 
again 
from freedom comes opportunity from opportunity comes growth 
from growth comes progress 
freedom is not an abstract concept no freedom is the 
inescapable essence of the american spirit the driving force which 
makes americans different from any other people on the face of the 
globe 
 
remember the cartermondale years 
taxes skyrocketed every year as the democrats inflation pushed 
everyone into higher tax brackets 
prices spiraled financially strangling those people least able 
to keep up this was heightened by the spending mania of a 
democratcontrolled congress savings plunged as prices rose a 
dollar saved in 1977 was worth only half by 1981 
215 percent interest rates levels not seen before or since 
placed the basic needs of life beyond the means of many american 
families 
 
in addition to all of these problems the democrats were telling 
us that there was something wrong with america and something wrong 
with its people 
something was terribly wrong but not with the people a 
halfcentury of destructive policies pitting americans against one 
another for the benefit of the democrats political machine had 
come to a dead end the democrats couldnt find a way out so the 
voters showed them the door 
now the ideological heirs of carter and mondale are trying again 
to sell the public a false bill of goods these liberals call 
americas prosperity an illusion they fantasize our economy is 
declining they claim our future is in the hands of other nations 
they arent operating in the real world 
 
this is not a portrait of a people in decline it is the profile 
of a cando country hopeful and compassionate on the move it is 
america resurgent renewed revitalized by an idea the belief that 
free men and women caring for families and supporting voluntary 
institutions in a nation of communities constitute the most 
powerful force for human progress 
 
jobs 
the republican party puts the creation of jobs and opportunity 
first 
the best jobs program the one that created 17 million jobs 
since 1982 is lower taxes on people we believe that every person 
who wants a job should have the opportunity to get a job we reject 
the notion that putting more americans to work causes inflation 
 
opportunity for all 
with its message of economic growth and opportunity the gop is 
the natural champion of blacks minorities women and ethnic 
americans we urge republican candidates and officials at all 
levels to extend to minority americans everywhere the historic 
invitation for full participation in our party 
a free economy helps defeat discrimination by fostering 
opportunity for all thats why real income for black families has 
risen 14 percent since 1982 its why members of minority groups 
have been gaining jobs in the republican recovery twice as fast as 
everyone else upward mobility for all americans has come back 
strong

the reaganbush policies of economic growth have finally turned 
around the deficit problem through republicaninitiated 
constraints on spending the federal budget deficit dropped by over 
25 percent last year with the help of the grammrudman law and a 
flexible budget freeze a balanced budget can be expected by 1993 
but the relentless spending of congressional democrats can undo 
our best efforts no president can cause deficits congress votes 
to spend money the american people must prevent bigspending 
congressional democrats from bringing back big budget deficits we 
must return both the senate and the house of representatives to 
republican control for the first time in 36 years 
in 1981 we inherited a federal spending machine that was out of 
control during the cartermondale years spending grew by 136 
percent annually we cut that growth rate in half but the cancer 
still expands as it has in some states such as massachusetts where 
the budget has increased more than twice as fast as the federal 
budget 
its time to push through the republican agenda for budget 
reform to teach the congress the kind of financial responsibility 
that characterizes the american family 
we call for structural changes to control government waste 
including a twoyear budget cycle a supermajority requirement for 
raising taxes a legislatively enacted lineitem veto individual 
transmission of spending bills greater rescission authority for 
the chief executive and other reforms 
we call for a flexible freeze on current government spending 
we call for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution if 
congressional democrats continue to block it we urge the states to 
renew their calls for a constitutional convention limited to 
consideration of such an amendment

americas best years lie ahead because republicans have faith 
in individuals we welcome the challenge of world competition with 
confidence in our countrys ability to outproduce outmanage 
outthink and outsell anyone 
this is the voters choice in 1988 compete or retreat the 
american people and the republican party are not about to retreat 
to make the 1990s americas decade in international trade 
republicans will advance trade through strength we will not accept 
the loss of american jobs to nationalized subsidized protected 
foreign industries and will continue to negotiate assertively the 
destruction of trade barriers 
we will not tolerate unfair trade and will use free trade as a 
weapon against it 
the bosses of the democrat party have thrown in the towel and 
abandoned the american worker and producer they have begun a 
fullscale retreat into protectionism an economic narcotic that 
saps the life out of commerce closes foreign markets to us 
producers and growers and costs american consumers billions of

among those messages were reported promises of miracles of 
physical and spiritual healing that would occur on mondays feast 
of the assumption the day catholics celebrate marys ascension 
into heaven 
i believe somethings going to happen said chrissy greliur 
a college student from birmingham ala i dont know if miracles 
will be physical but maybe spiritual

the republican party restates the unequivocal promise we made in 
1984 we oppose any attempts to increase taxes tax increases harm 
the economic expansion and reverse the trend to restoring control 
of the economy to individual americans 
we reject calls for higher taxes from all quarters including 
bipartisan commissions the decisions of our government should 
not be left to a body of unelected officials 
the american people deserve to know before the election where 
all candidates stand on the question of tax increases republicans 
unequivocally reiterate the notax pledge we have proudly taken 
while we wouldnt believe the democrats even if they took the 
pledge they havent taken it 
the crowning economic achievement of the republican party under 
ronald reagan and george bush has been the dramatic reduction in 
personal income taxes 
republicans know that sustaining the american economic miracle 
requires a growing pool of private savings 
to keep it going 
we will reduce to 15 percent the tax rates for longterm capital 
gains to promote investment in jobs and to raise revenue for the 
federal government by touching off another surge of economic 
expansion 
we call for a taxpayers bill of rights to give everyone simple 
and inexpensive means to resolve disputes with government

republican leadership has launched a new era in american 
education our vision of excellence has brought education back to 
parents back to basics and back on a track of excellence 
for two decades before 1981 poor public policies had led to an 
alarming decline in performance in our schools unfocused federal 
spending seemed to worsen the situation then president reagan

choice and competition in education foster quality and protect

accountability and evaluation of performance at all levels 
is the key to continuing reform in education 
we oppose any programs in public schools which provide birth 
control or abortion services or referrals 
federal policy should empower lowincome families to choose 
quality and demand accountability in their childrens schooling

government weather forecasters have become 
the lastest group of federal employees to successfully challenge 
the reagan administrations random drug testing program 
in blocking the testing us district judge robert schnacke on 
friday cited the governments admission that no instances of drug 
abuse or drugrelated safety problems have ever been documented 
among national weather service meteorologists the testing was 
scheduled to begin aug 26 
justice department lawyer richard hertling contended no such 
evidence was needed to allow drug testing of a forecaster whose 
misjudgment conceivably could kill 300 or 400 people flying in a 
jumbo jet in a storm theres no need to wait for an accident like 
that to happen 
three other federal judges two in san francisco and one in 
washington have blocked drug testing programs for federal workers 
including federal prison employees most of the veterans 
administration staff and justice department employees 
another judge in san francisco has upheld postaccident drug 
testing of air traffic controllers 
the programs stem from president reagans september 1986 
executive order calling for testing of employees in sensitive 
federal jobs 
the commerce department which includes the national weather 
service has declared that all meteorologists and technicians hold 
sensitive jobs and should be subject to random urine testing 
with about 5 percent to be tested each year illegal drug use would 
be grounds for removal from the job 
richard hirn a lawyer for the 1000member national weather 
service employees organization said the random drug testing 
program covers about 3800 weather service employees including 
supervisors and nonunion members 
hirn said schnackes order applies only to union members who 
filed the suit but is likely to discourage the service from 
conducting any random drug tests 
schnacke said the government had offered no evidence that drug 
problems exist among meteorologists much less that public safety 
is threatened 
schnacke said he could envision some remote lonely weather 
station where you might want to take some artificial relief to 
change the scenery but he added invading peoples privacy on 
the premise that someday somewhere somehow some problem might 
arise seems to be going too far 
in issuing the injunction he said the union was very likely to 
prove in a trial that the testing violated the constitutional ban 
on unreasonable searches 
the injunction binding until the lawsuit goes to trial forbids 
drug testing of union members without evidence that an individual 
employee is using drugs or is under the influence of drugs on the 
job

irrigation has dramatically lowered the level of 
the aral sea leaving behind briny pools the size of football 
fields and 12000 square miles of land that was once under water 
pravda said saturday 
the article in the communist party newspaper written by 
geographer d oreshkin said the seas level is dropping an average 
of 3 feet annually the article blamed the problem on regional rice 
field irrigation 
the loss of the sea is a tragedy for nearby citizens the 
article said fish die and former fishermen become unemployed 
the lower levels also have seriously hampered ship deliveries of 
coal used for heating in the region the article said 
the aral sea is sometimes called a lake but it is properly a 
sea because it is a landlocked saltwater body bounded on the 
north by the soviet republic of kazakhstan and on the south by 
another soviet republic uzbekistan 
environmental problems once taboo in the official media are 
now discussed more freely under soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
the topic of the ecological crisis on the aral lake was in the 
press but it looks as though action has been stopped along the 
way the pravda article said 
not only is the sea dying but peoples patience too the 
article said public opinion in areas near the aral is painfully 
concentrated on the fate of the sea all hopes are connected with 
its revival 
higher than average rainfall over the last two years alleviated 
the problem somewhat but not enough to significantly offset the 
drainage the article said it said more water was lost through 
evaporation than replenished by rainfall and the seas two main 
feeder rivers 
it said the receding aral shoreline has left pools of highly 
concentrated saltwater throughout the area some of them as big as 
football fields 
meanwhile the saline content in the ground and water near the 
lake is so high that nothing will grow the article said oreshkin 
suggested an underground drainage system to carry the saltwater 
back to the sea 
oreshkin also said irrigation water should be used more frugally 
regional farmers are dependent on irrigation of their fields of 
rice a main crop of the central asian economy 
such water problems have also been reported elsewhere 
in june the official news agency tass said authorities in 
kazakhstan the soviet republic bounding the aral sea on the north 
had halted construction of two irrigation projects for fear of 
excessively draining lake balkhash

edward bennett williams the supreme criminal 
lawyer and roguish sports entrepreneur whose spellbinding command 
of a courtroom rivaled that of boyhood idol clarence darrow died 
saturday in georgetown university hospital he was 68 
williams owner of the baltimore orioles and former president 
and part owner of the washington redskins secured his own lofty 
niche in american trial lore while still in his 30s he won fame 
fortune and a phenomenal string of verdicts in an area of the law 
where attorneys usually lose and rarely get rich 
he was an exponent of what he called contest living 
obsessed with victory a dreadnought in the competitive urges of 
man he gave no quarter even to the disease that finally killed 
him after he had fended off its assault for more than a decade with 
ofttortuous therapy and at least seven operations virtually to 
the end he worked hard as ever either its going to beat me 
he said of his cancer or im going to beat it 
williams enchanted juries befuddled prosecutors defended 
pariahs and befriended the mighty inside the courtroom he beat 
the best the government could offer outside of it he gave his best 
to government performing a variety of tough legal missions abroad 
and advisory roles at home 
sometimes he so irked his adversaries that he drew out the worst 
in them richard m nixon once vowed on tape that we are going to 
fix williams a lifelong democrat who privately called nixon 
snake brains had nixon instead sought his counsel he would 
have burned his tapes and probably saved his office 
williams frustrated friends too in the name of unpopular 
clients and causes robert f kennedy then counsel for the senate 
rackets committee was a frequent breakfast companion after early 
mass but williams enraged him by his successful defense of jimmy 
hoffa in a 1957 bribery case during the trial kennedy vowed to 
jump off the capitol dome if hoffa were acquitted williams 
gleefully replied ill buy him a parachute 
williams broad of shoulders and belly noble of brow over soft 
graygreen eyes was absolutely monastic during a trial devoting 
every ounce of energy within his 6foot1 frame to his client 
between cases he was an ornery funloving man who was equally at 
ease bending elbows with a pug fighter at toots shors in new york 
city or dining with washingtons elite at the white house 
he defended hoffa john connally frank costello richard helms 
joseph r mccarthy adam clayton powell dave beck bernard 
goldfine bobby baker a secret us agent suspected of murdering 
his commanding officer abroad and two russian diplomats charged 
with espionage costello the mobster who was the model for mario 
puzos godfather once said ive had 40 lawyers but eds 
the champ eds the champ its like throwing dice man throws the 
six he cant pay off ed makes the point ed makes the point 
in the early days he was sneered at by many in the legal 
establishment for his willingness to defend unsavory characters 
but that merely stiffened his resolve the more opprobrium that 
was attached to the client he said the more i relished the 
case 
that didnt mean he had to like the customer he treated most 
with a certain aloofness i have only two things to say to them 
tell me the truth and understand right now that i am going to 
have dictatorial power in running this case they all want me to 
hold their hands im sorry for them but ive got no business 
babying them when i ought to be out working for them he said 
williams customers also included the democratic national 
committee he served two years as the partys treasurer and the 
washington post the ford motor co and gulf amp western his firm 
williams and connolly occupied a 10story building in downtown 
washington employed scores of lawyers and was known more 
familiarly as the department of defense williams chief 
partner paul connolly died years ago 
by his own account williams personally lost only one major 
case the 1967 fraud and income tax evasion trial of bobby baker 
an aide to lyndon b johnson according to baker williams went 
home with him immediately after the guilty verdict and burst into 
tears he did not cry a silent gentlemanly stream of tears his 
thick body shook and jerked almost convulsively as he sobbed 
mucous ran from his nose i wiped it off mixed him a stiff drink 
and tried to comfort him he was inconsolable baker said 
he couldnt stand losing outside the courtroom either as 
president of the redskins he spent to get the best first hiring 
the legendary vince lombardi winning isnt everything its the 
only thing as coach and then after lombardis death george 
allen williams was only halfjoking when he once said of allen 
i gave him an unlimited budget and he exceeded it 
when jack kent cooke bought out his share and virtual control 
of the football team williams already had acquired a new toy 
baseballs orioles in nearby baltimore the team won the 1983 world 
series with manager joe altobelli but when it began to slump in 
1985 williams promptly dumped him and lured another coaching 
legend earl weaver out of retirement 
he called me a cement head said altobelli williams said he 
didnt remember using that particular term but it was not 
inconsistent with my thinking on the subject as it turned out 
even weaver couldnt rejuvenate the orioles pitching and he 
retired again after the 1986 season 
cal ripken sr the 1987 manager got the ax after the orioles 
dropped six consecutive games to open the 1988 season they went on 
to lose another 15 straight under new skipper frank robinson and 
the teams dismal slide despite a multimilliondollar lineup that 
included eddie murrry cal ripken jr and fred lynn was perhaps 
the bitterest pill of williams waning weeks 
in football he said recently you only have 16 vulnerable 
days for depression in baseball its practically every day 
despite his deteriorating health williams remained in active 
control of the orioles until late may when he turned over 
daytoday operations to law partner lawrence lucchino 
his competitive urges spilled everywhere a former colleague 
pierce odonnell once beat williams at tennis ed never asked me 
to play again odonnell said 
one year williams and his kids showed up at the home of 
columnist art buchwald for their traditional family game of touch 
football before thanksgiving dinner but williams also brought 
along an outrageous ringer a gentleman named christian adolph 
sonny jurgenson then destined for the pro football hall of 
fame for throwing the purest spirals in the history of the game 
they still lost buchwald said it was the greatest 
thanksgiving the buchwalds ever had 
williams born may 31 1920 was a poor boy the only child of a 
floorwalker in a hartford conn department store when his father 
was laid off during the depression he all but abandoned his hopes 
of going to college but the vice principal of his high school got 
him a scholarship at holy cross the rigidly disciplined jesuit 
college at worcester mass he became a star debater racking up an 
unbroken string of victories against eastern colleges we always 
tried to figure out gimmicks something to throw the other fellow 
off stride he recalled 
he joined the army air force in world war ii but was soon 
injured in the crash of a training plane everyone else aboard was 
killed and was discharged he then enrolled at the georgetown 
university law school in washington and bored by classwork made 
a practice of wandering into the us courthouse to sit through 
trials i watched bad lawyers he said i learned a lot from 
their mistakes 
even before he passed the bar hogan amp hartson then the 
capitals secondlargest law firm hired him on georgetowns 
recommendation among his clients were several breweries in those 
days empty beer bottles were sometimes improperly washed and 
mice attracted by the smell of yeast would occasionally climb 
into them and die when the bottles were refilled and sold again 
they became to some customers as valuable as gold 
williams said he learned one rule of thumb when a beer drinker 
charged into court corpus delecti in bottle bottle in hand 
complaining of indigestion if the jury kept its collective 
breakfast down continue to fight but if just one threw up a 
quick outofcourt settlement was advisable 
after marrying his bosss daughter dorothy adair williams hung 
out his own shingle she died at age 34 of a respiratory illness 
and williams married agnes neill then a top lawyer in his own 
firm a year later he had three children by his first marriage 
four by the second 
one of williams greatest talents dating to those early 
negligence cases was his skill at crossexamination it is he 
said the art of putting a bridle on a witness who has been 
called to do you harm you must think of him as a man with a 
knife in his hand who is out to stab you and you must feel your 
way with him as if you were in a dark room together you must move 
with him roll with him you must never explore or experiment 
during crossexamination you must never ask a question if you do 
not already know the answer 
never attack points that are unassailable said williams 
and if you hit a telling shot try not to let the witness know 
it keep quiet and go on the time to dramatize it to the jury is 
during your closing argument 
and nobody closed better than williams his calm accommodating 
manner during the trial would at the end turn to thunder and 
lightning during the hoffa trial for example he tripped up a key 
government witness over a seemingly inconsequential point and 
true to his own rule quickly moved on with no show of emotion but 
during the summation arms and long wavy hair akimbo he boomed 
from this mans lips we learn that he lies from this mans lips 
we learn that he deceives from this mans lips were learn that he 
falsifies what kind of man can lie he said voice now ebbing 
while carrying the rosary the symbol of truth honesty and 
beauty 
being in the courtroom with williams said odonnell was 
somewhat akin to having your breath sucked out by a tornado 
but williams didnt try to convince juries by himself he was a 
great believer in the character witness and produced some 
spectacular lineups tailored to the makeup of the jury box for the 
connally bribery case before a mostly black jury he paraded to 
the stand one civil rights hero after another to testify to 
connallys integrity 
then he called billy graham 
q what is your profession 
a i teach the gospel of jesus christ across the face of the 
earth 
voice from the jury amen 
williams wry grin on his face said later i thought that 
that was a good sign 
i try to be guided by the ethics i was taught by the 
jesuits said williams a trial is like a war

people filled the streets of burmas 
capital saturday to celebrate the resignation of the president one 
dissident called burmas hitler but skirmishes continued 
outside rangoon diplomats and travelers said 
western diplomats in rangoon said the capital was quiet after 
massive protests and violence claimed at least 95 lives during the 
17day rule of hardline leader sein lwin who resigned friday 
but they cited reports of minor skirmishes in the eastern suburb 
of okkalapa and unconfirmed reports of looting and shooting in the 
workingclass area where some of the fiercest fighting raged last 
week 
food and medicine were scarce and barely any transportation was 
available into the capital from the countryside said the 
diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity 
shops reopened and citizens filled the streets to cheer the 
resignation of the president they described as the butcher of 
students according to brett b lambert an american student 
returning from rangoon 
people are smiling and happy lambert said 
news reports said students in the capital continued passing out 
leflets urging protests to win democracy 
lambert said posters on walls of the capital showed sein lwin 
with blood dripping from his mouth a skull and crossbones around 
his face and massacre written beneath 
burmas hitler was brought down by the might of all the 
people japans kyodo news agency quoted one burmese as saying 
peter swan an australian film maker returning from rangoon 
said he visited the rangoon general hospital and saw more than 300 
people wounded from the demonstrations last week 
diplomats said hundreds may have died in the fighting and 
unconfirmed reports said up to 1000 were killed 
rangoon a city of 35 million had been under a daytime curfew 
since tuesday 
the diplomats said prices were soaring food was running low and 
hospitals which normally function at threadbare levels were 
reported seriously short of blood bandages and other vital medical 
supplies 
sein lwin stepped down after reports that burmese soldiers were 
turning against the government and allowing people to march through 
some towns in support of democracy and economic reforms 
burmas official rangoon radio which announced the resignation 
gave no reason and did not say who sein lwins successor would be 
were in a kind of waitandsee mode the burmese are very 
relieved that sein lwin stepped down but basically skeptical about 
what it all means one diplomat said is this cosmetic or is it 
a real concession to the demonstrators 
lambert said that before fridays announcement large numbers of 
troops moved through rangoon in armored personnel carriers 
protesters torched buildings street lights houses and police 
stations in the city which was under martial law 
after the announcement soldiers stationed around lamberts 
hotel withdrew but lambert said a number of burmese told him it 
was not over yet and that much depended on who would be the next 
president 
josef silverstein a leading american expert on burma said in a 
telephone interview that a likely candidate for president was kyaw 
htin a relatively liberal military officer who received some 
training in the united states he has been the no 3 man in the 
government and party 
burmas economic recovery is expected to be slow and difficult 
once one of asias wealthiest nations burma is now among the 
worlds poorest countries with per capital income less than 200 a 
year 
almost 80 percent of the loans burma received in 1986 came from 
japan but tokyos aid has been declining 
japan on saturday called for swift economic reforms in burma and 
urged the country to restore order the japanese foreign ministry 
said economic depression was the major cause of the protests in 
burma 
minoru kiryu of the asian economy research center in tokyo said 
that with recent aid cuts japan has been putting pressure on 
burmese leaders to carry out economic and political reforms 
the economic problems were brought on by the isolationist 
policies of ne win who ruled burma for 26 years he resigned last 
month citing student unrest in march and june sein lwin was 
elected his successor july 26 
almost immediately students monks workers and others filled 
the streets of rangoon demanding the new presidents ouster they 
blamed the former general for brutally crushing the march and june 
student unrest and cited his bloody suppression of rangoon 
university riots after the 1962 coup 
the protests spread to two dozen other cities and on tuesday 
soldiers began firing into mobs of demonstrators 
reports from burma indicated security forces in at least two 
towns sided with the protesters and a guerrilla leader fighting 
the government called for a coordinated nationwide offensive

15member selection committee that met at tarn taran 19 miles 
south of the sikh holy city of amritsar 
two members of the committee walked out in protest against ragi 
four committee memhbers are in prison and a fifth mal singh 
ghumman is in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds he was

cuba may try to keep its estimated 
50000 military personnel in angola as civilian workers despite a 
commitment to withdraw them under a pact with angola and south 
africa a newspaper reported saturday 
the independent weekly expresso quoted unidentified diplomatic 
sources in lisbon in its report 
it said only cuba was opposed to the section of the accord on 
the withdrawal of its troops from angola but accepted it under 
pressure from the soviet union 
the agreement was announced monday after the fifth round of 
peace talks between south africa angola and cuba with the united 
states participating ended in geneva aug 5 
the accord includes a ceasefire that went into effect monday 
and calls for south africa to begin withdrawing its 3000 soldiers 
from southern angola 
it set a deadline of sept 1 to reach agreement on a timetable 
for the complete removal of cuban troops from angola and calls for 
south africa to give independence to southwest africa also known 
as namibia 
south africas whiteminority government has administered 
namibia since the end of world war i under a mandate of the defunct 
league of nations that mandate was abolished by the united 
nations but south africa has rejected un demands to give the 
territory independence one reason given by the south africans is 
the cuban military presence in marxistruled angola 
expresso quoted one diplomat as saying the cubans are 
reluctant to pull out of angola and they are expected to try to 
keep them the cuban troops there by getting them civilian 
cooperation worker status 
the paper reported cubas opposition to repatriating its troops 
included concern over problems of reintegrating so many soldiers 
back into society 
angola gained its independence from portugal in 1975 and marxist 
forces defeated the prowestern national union for the total unity 
of angola in the civil war that followed 
south africa and the united states have supported the guerrillas 
while the angolan government has received assistance from the

the mississippi senate toiled through a 
hot summer saturday on a county government reorganization bill 
inspired by an fbi corruption investigation that snared dozens of 
public officials 
senators worked their way through 32 proposed amendments hoping 
to pass a version of the bill that could be reconciled with one 
passed by the state house on thursday 
lawmakers have been meeting since wednesday in a special session 
called by gov ray mabus who instructed them to consider mandating 
county supervisors to turn over daytoday government management to 
countywide administrators sixty of the 82 counties have some kind 
of beat system in which supervisors oversee the daily 
operations of their individual districts 
much of the senate debate preceded a 3220 vote on an amendment 
to set a nov 8 referendum for voters to decide whether their 
counties would maintain roads on a district or countywide basis 
sen terry jordon argued that the governor should be able to set 
a later referendum to leave time for review by the us justice 
department which could hear complaints under the voting rights act 
of 1965 about whether the reorganization would dilute the voting 
power of minorities 
sen alan heflin author of the amendment argued that counties 
involved in the referendum should be spared the expense of running 
a special election 
the house which adjourned after a brief saturday session until 
2 pm sunday also set the referendum for nov 8 the presidential 
election day 
the senate version of the bill would require counties to 
implement central purchasing receiving and inventory control 
systems they also would be required to implement countywide road 
construction leaving only maintenance for voters to decide 
mabus inaugurated in january tried unsuccessfully to push a 
socalled county unit bill through the legislatures 120day 
regular session earlier this year 
negotiators were unable to work out differences between house 
and senate versions and the bill died mabus then vetoed a bill 
that would have given 20 percent pay hikes to all of the states 
410 supervisors and vowed to call the special session 
calls for county government reform came in the wake of a federal 
crackdown on corrupt county purchasing practices that has so far 
resulted in charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion against 56 
supervisors in 25 counties 
of those 42 have pleaded guilty six have been convicted by 
juries one was acquitted one died before coming to trial one 
died after sentencing and another was declared mentally incompetent 
to stand trial the remainder have charges pending

south african foreign minister roelof 
botha said saturday his country has the capability to make a 
nuclear bomb should we want to but he declined to say if it 
has produced any nuclear weapons 
botha spoke at a news conference after holding talks with 
diplomats from the united states soviet union and britain the 
three countries with nuclear weapons that have signed the 1969 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
there have been numerous reports in recent years that south 
africa could produce nuclear weapons and lowlevel government 
officials have indirectly confirmed some of the reports 
botha said he could not say whether his talks had brought south 
africa closer to signing the treaty 
the treaty that has been signed by 137 governments provides for 
inspections by specialists of the viennabased international atomic 
energy agency 
two states with nuclear weapons france and china have not 
signed the treaty among other countries believed to be capable of 
producing nuclear bombs that have not signed are india pakistan 
israel and libya as well as south africa 
botha said south africa supports the objectives of the npt 
completely 
but he added it is interested to know if the npt would be used 
in a discriminatory manner against the south african government 
we want to know exactly what implications flow from signing 
my task was to come and find out how the united states 
soviet union and britain interpret the key issues botha said 
he did not elaborate 
botha also questioned the objectivity of the international 
atomic energy agency towards south africa and its whitecontrolled 
government 
african and other thirdworld countries have repeatedly 
attempted to have south africa ousted as a member of the agency 
because of its refusal to sign the nonproliferation treaty they 
also oppose south africa because of its apartheid policy of racial 
segregation 
at the agencys general assembly last year a decision on south 
africas expulsion was postponed following an announcement by south 
africa that it was considering signing the treaty the general 
assembly will holds its annual meeting next month 
botha was asked if his talks here were aimed to achieve another 
postponment and he said the subject matter is of such importance 
that we dont take decisions under the threat of time schedules

soviets who risk their rubles on everything from 
roulette to racing will face tougher penalties against gambling 
under new rules adopted by the legislature tass said saturday 
the official news agency said anybody caught gambling will face 
fines of 162 to 810 the average monthly pay in the soviet union 
is 324 
persons playing games like cards or roulette for money and 
valuables and receiving stakes at sport and other competitions in 
circumvention of the existing order at racecourses and other 
facilities will no longer get off with a warning or a small fine 
the article said 
tass did not say what the fines had been in the past 
the stricter penalties were in the form of amendments to the 
present gambling law tass said the supreme soviet the countrys 
nominal parliament passed the legislation thursday 
the new law calls for severe punishment for repeat offenders 
they could face imprisonment for 12 months up to two years in a 
corrective labor institution or a fine of 1620 authorities 
could also confiscate their property 
until recently gambling received little attention in the soviet 
press but over the last year many newspapers have run stories 
warning people of the penalties 
one soviet who asked not to be identified said she watched a 
shell game in progress last week in an underground pedestrian 
tunnel 
the game had attracted a small crowd of people several of whom 
were willing to pay 81 for the chance to guess which of three 
thimbles hid a pea 
i watched this for several minutes she said and there 
was a lot of money changing hands

suspected tamil insurgents shot and 
killed seven indian soldiers saturday after blowing up a railway 
bridge linking colombo with northern sri lanka indian authorities 
said 
an official at the indian embassy in colombo said the soldiers 
were ambushed near the town of vavuniya 135 miles north of colombo 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soldiers were patrolling railway tracks in the area after tamil 
rebels blew up a nearby bridge to disconnect links between colombo 
and the jaffna peninsula to the north 
the latest ambush raises the number of indian soldiers killed in 
sri lanka since last october to at least 544 india said last month 
that 537 soldiers had been killed but the embassy official said no 
updated figures were available 
india has at least 50000 troops in sri lanka to enforce a peace 
accord aimed at ending the tamil insurgency on the island the 
rebels reneged on the accord last fall and the indians have since 
attempted to disarm them 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
radicals started a campaign for an independent tamil homeland in

voters in a straw poll saturday said no 
by a threetotwo margin to a proposal to bring gambling back to 
this island where casinos once flourished 
supporters hoped a favorable vote in the nonbinding referendum 
would persuade the texas legislature to pass legislation enabling 
legalized gambling proponents lost similar referendums in 1984 and 
1987 
late saturday unofficial returns from all 14 precincts showed 
7368 or 593 percent voted against legalized casino gambling to 
5062 or 407 percent in favor 
both backers and opponents of gambling had predicted a close 
vote on the referendum which was called after a progambling group 
gathered enough petition signatures 
theres no way this is going to be a blowout for either 
side said steve long coordinator for galvestonians against 
casino gambling this is the closest its ever been but ill say 
well end up with 54 percent of the vote 
pete fredriksen chairman of the progambling group called 
galvestonians for economic development said hed be content with 
merely 50 percent plus one vote 
the referendum asked voters to approve a gambling district in 
galveston that backers say would include four casino hotels with at 
least 500 rooms each 
if such a measure passed the legislature galveston voters would 
have to pass the proposal again in a binding local option vote 
a week before saturdays voting proponents already had spent 
more than 100000 while anticasino forces listed expenditures of 
nearly 70000 
in 1984 the proposal attracted a record voter turnout of more 
than 12600 people but it lost by a 21 margin last years 
attempt which again drew more than 12000 voters fell by a 32 
edge 
progambling forces estimated that casino taxes would raise 
millions for the state and city and that casinos would create 
20000 new jobs in galveston 
but opponents including mayor jan coggeshall and local police 
contended that only developers and casino operators would benefit 
from gambling they said small businesses and others who refused to 
live in a casino town would be driven out of the city they also 
worried that approval of the measure would wipe out prolonged 
efforts that promote galveston as a family resort 
people gambled in the coastal town from about 1925 until a 
government crackdown in the late 1950s ran the casino and slot 
machine operators out of town 
galvestons hollywood club which featured some of the biggest 
entertainment names of the era was the first airconditioned night 
club in the country in 1957 state officials found some 1000 slot 
machines stored in the club some were burned and others were 
dumped in the galveston harbor

president daniel ortega said saturday 
a victory by democrat michael dukakis in novembers presidential 
election could bring improved us relations with central america 
ortega also said nicaragua would accept an international peace 
force to guarantee security along its border with honduras 
the president speaking to nicaraguan ambassadors now in 
managua said dukakis holds different views on latin american 
policy than those of vice president george bush the republican 
candidate 
bushs policy is the same as president reagans a 
confirmation of the monroe doctrine while that of dukakis is 
different ortega said 
the monroe doctrine outlined in 1823 by president james monroe 
asserts that latin america holds special importance for us 
security and other nations should not interfere in the region 
if eventually dukakis reaches the presidency of the united 
states and has the opportunity and capacity to implement the policy 
he has announced during the democratic convention very important 
foundations would be laid to establish a dialogue that provides 
a new type of relations between the united states latin america 
and the caribbean ortega said 
dukakis has opposed resuming military aid to nicaraguan rebels 
known as contras bush supports such aid and the us senate voted 
last week to provide 27 million in humanitarian assistance to the 
contras 
speaking of a possible border peacekeeping force ortega said 
the nicaraguanhonduran frontier is a powder keg that could be 
made to explode at any minute by the united states to justify an 
invasion of nicaragua 
he proposed that a border peace force be put together by spain 
canada west germany and a country from the contadora group and its 
support nations 
mexico venezuela colombia and panama make up the contadora 
group that was formed in 1983 at a meeting of foreign ministers on 
the panamanian island of contadora to seek peace in central 
america brazil argentina peru and uruguay are the support 
nations 
ortega made a similar proposal after honduras suggested the 
creation of a border peace force in november 1987 at a meeting of 
the organization of american states in washington 
ortega also told the ambassadors that his sandinista government 
will continue a unilateral ceasefire with the rebels until aug 31 
negotiations on a permanent ceasefire stalled in june ortega 
proposed friday that a new round of talks on ending the 
sevenyearold war be held in managua or washington

cuban president fidel castro on saturday 
accused washington of trying to dominate latin america and said 
uscuban relations will not improve until america changes its 
policies 
the communist leader said the two nations would remain at odds 
while the united states meddles in our countries while the 
united states practices that role of dominance that it has assumed 
for itself 
but castro also said he hoped for improved relations with 
america he said he came close to applauding us secretary of 
state george p shultz when shultz entered ecuadors congress on 
wednesday for the inauguration of ecuadors new president a 
socialist 
castro shultz and other international leaders were in quito to 
attend the inauguration of president rodrigo borja who has pledged 
a nonaligned foreign policy 
during a twohourlong news conference castro said the huge 
foreign debts owed by latin american nations could not be paid he 
compared attempts by international bankers to collect the debt with 
efforts to extract the last drop of blood from a dying man 
on another topic castro said cubansoviet relations have not 
been hurt by soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs social and economic 
reforms 
i want you to know that there are no problems between 
gorbachev and me he said

a federal judge finding evidence that 
american airlines exerted monopoly control over the airline ticket 
reservation market has allowed 12 smaller carriers to proceed with 
a 300000 antitrust suit 
us district judge edward rafeedie on friday also found 
sufficient evidence of predatory pricecutting and price 
discrimination in americans sabre reservation system to proceed to 
trial on those claims 
sabre along with united airlines reservation system delivers 
most airlines tickets sold in the united states 
smaller airlines which pay fees for tickets booked through the 
systems contend that american and united abuse their domination in 
the computer reservation market by charging high fees and imposing 
restrictions that make it difficult for travel agents to switch to 
rival systems 
american and united counter that the fees are needed to 
compensate for the millions of dollars invested in computers and 
data banks american says it has invested 400 million in sabre 
the judges decision means a jury may decide whether american 
has engaged in anticompetitive business practices and it left open 
the possibility that a jury can decide whether united may have 
engaged in a limited monopoly over the computer reservation market 
the judge dismissed claims that american and united wielded a 
monopoly over the entire airline industry saying both airlines 
make up only a small portion of the airline market 
lawyers for both american and the smaller carriers both 
expressed satisfaction with the ruling 
were pleased that our legal theory has been judicially 
vindicated and we have an opportunity to try these charges said 
maxwell m blecher an attorney for usair one of the carriers 
challenging american and united 
on balance were very pleased with the outcome said 
american lawyer j edd stepp jr to the extent the judge did not 
agree with us all hes said is the plaintiffs have raised enough 
of a factual issue that hes not going to decide this without a 
jury trial

edward bennett williams trial lawyer and 
owner of the baltimore orioles and former president and part owner 
of the washington redskins was a man who believed in winning 
what he called contest living 
williams enchanted juries befuddled prosecutors defended 
pariahs and befriended the mighty 
sometimes he so irked his adversaries that he drew out the worst 
in them richard m nixon once vowed on tape that we are going to 
fix williams a lifelong democrat who privately called nixon 
snake brains 
williams frustrated friends too robert f kennedy then 
counsel for the senate rackets committee was a frequent breakfast 
companion but williams enraged him by his successful defense of 
jimmy hoffa in a 1957 bribery case 
during the trial kennedy vowed to jump off the capitol dome 
if hoffa were acquitted williams gleefully replied ill buy him 
a parachute 
one of his clients was frank costello the mobster who was the 
model for mario puzos godfather costello once said ive 
had 40 lawyers but eds the champ eds the champ its like 
throwing dice man throws the six he cant pay off ed makes the 
point ed makes the point 
in the early days he was sneered at by many in the legal 
establishment for his willingness to defend unsavory characters 
but that merely stiffened his resolve the more opprobrium that 
was attached to the client he said the more i relished the 
case 
that didnt mean he had to like the customer he treated most 
with a certain aloofness i have only two things to say to them 
tell me the truth and understand right now that i am going to 
have dictatorial power in running this case 
they all want me to hold their hands im sorry for them but 
ive got no business babying them when i ought to be out working 
for them he said 
by his own account williams said bobby bakers tax evasion 
trial was the only major case he ever lost 
baker recalls that williams went home with him immediately after 
the guilty verdict and burst into tears he did not cry a silent 
gentlemanly stream of tears his thick body shook and jerked almost 
convulsively as he sobbed mucous ran from his nose i wiped it 
off mixed him a stiff drink and tried to comfort him he was 
inconsolable baker said 
when jack kent cooke bought out his 13 percent share of the 
washington redskins football team williams already had acquired 
baseballs orioles in nearby baltimore 
the team won the 1983 world series with manager joe altobelli 
but when it began to slump in 1985 williams promptly dumped him 
and lured another coaching legend earl weaver out of retirement 
he called me a cement head said altobelli williams said he 
didnt remember using that particular term but it was not 
inconsistent with my thinking on the subject 
as it turned out even weaver couldnt rejuvenate the orioles 
pitching and he retired again after the 1986 season 
a graduate of holy cross williams enrolled in georgetown 
university law school and bored by classwork made a practice of 
wandering into the us courthouse to watch trials i watched bad 
lawyers he said i learned a lot from their mistakes 
even before he passed the bar hogan amp hartson then the 
capitals secondlargest law firm hired him on georgetowns 
recommendation 
among his clients were several breweries in those days empty 
beer bottles were sometimes improperly washed and mice attracted 
by the smell of yeast would occasionally climb into them and die 
when the bottles were refilled and sold again they became to some 
customers as valuable as gold 
williams said he learned one rule of thumb when a beer drinker 
charged into court corpus delecti in bottle bottle in hand 
complaining of indigestion if the jury kept its collective 
breakfast down continue to fight but if just one threw up a 
quick outofcourt settlement was advisable 
his competitive urges spilled everywhere a former colleague 
pierce odonnell once beat williams at tennis ed never asked me 
to play again odonnell said 
one year williams and his kids showed up at the home of 
columnist art buchwald for their traditional family game of touch 
football before thanksgiving dinner but williams also brought 
along an outrageous ringer a gentleman named christian adolph 
sonny jurgensen then destined for the pro football hall of 
fame for throwing the purest spirals in the history of the game 
they still lost buchwald said it was the greatest 
thanksgiving the buchwalds ever had 
one of williams greatest talents was his skill at 
crossexamination it is he said the art of putting a 
bridle on a witness who has been called to do you harm you must 
think of him as a man with a knife in his hand who is out to stab 
you and you must feel your way with him as if you were in a dark 
room together you must move with him roll with him you must 
never explore or experiment during crossexamination you must 
never ask a question if you do not already know the answer 
never attack points that are unassailable said williams 
and if you hit a telling shot try not to let the witness know 
it keep quiet and go on the time to dramatize it to the jury is 
during your closing argument 
nobody closed better than williams his calm accommodating 
manner during the trial would at the end turn to thunder and 
lightning 
during the hoffa trial for example he tripped up a key 
government witness over a seemingly inconsequential point and 
true to his own rule quickly moved on with no show of emotion 
but during the summation arms and long wavy hair akimbo he 
boomed from this mans lips we learn that he lies from this 
mans lips we learn that he deceives from this mans lips were 
learn that he falsifies what kind of man can lie he said voice 
now ebbing while carrying the rosary the symbol of truth 
honesty and beauty 
being in the courtroom with williams said odonnell was 
somewhat akin to having your breath sucked out by a tornado 
but williams didnt try to convince juries by himself he was a 
great believer in the character witness and produced some 
spectacular lineups tailored to the makeup of the jury box for the 
connally bribery case before a mostly black jury he paraded to 
the stand one civil rights hero after another to testify to 
connallys integrity 
then he called billy graham 
q what is your profession 
a i teach the gospel of jesus christ across the face of the 
earth 
voice from the jury amen 
williams wry grin on his face said later i thought that 
that was a good sign 
i try to be guided by the ethics i was taught by the 
jesuits said williams a trial is like a war

a state review of a brooklyn hospital found five 
questionable deaths improperly stored radioactive waste and 
records so sloppy that a mans chart identified him as a woman 
the state department of health made the findings during a 
twoweek survey of the 620bed interfaith medical center the daily 
news reported in sundays editions 
the 95page report said the hospital failed to provide proper 
care in 16 cases more than half of which involved deaths 
including five that state officials said were questionable but were 
not noted in doctors special files as required by law the 
newspaper said 
it said two 55gallon drums and at least four large plastic bags 
were filled with radioactive waste they were not protected from 
tampering and were left exposed to the weather and vermin 
the report which cited dozens of violations also said one 
womans normal gall bladder was unnecessarily removed and a 
79yearold heart patients leg was amputated without her 
permission 
the deficiencies are very serious and ones that involve many 
key areas of the hospital said wayne osten director of the 
states bureau of hospital services 
theodore jamison the hospitals president said he had just 
received the report and was not prepared to comment 
the notforprofit hospital was created five years ago when 
brooklyn jewish hospital and st johns episcopal hospital merged 
in 1986 interfaiths two facilities 81 clinics and its 
emergency wards handled more than 200000 patient visits 
lars larmon a hospital spokesman said interfaith is 20 
million in debt he said the administration has been using money 
from its operating budget to pay for physical improvements of the 
antiquated brooklyn jewish site resulting in a shortage of 
medical supplies materials and everything else 
larmon said 14 percent of its admissions are the working poor or 
homeless 
osten said the financial problems cannot be accepted as 
adequate justification for the medical nursing and 
qualityassurance problems we have identified 
the hospital has until sept 8 to create a corrective plan of 
action

heavy rains again flooded this desert 
capital saturday and a cabinet minister said international aid 
coming in was not enough for the 2 million people left homeless so 
far 
the latest storm began around midnight friday and lasted until 
midmorning tearing trees from their roots and leaving huge pools 
of water in the streets of downtown khartoum a city of 4 million 
the citys airport was shut down and the nile river was rising 
fueling fears that it might soon overflow and worsen the damge 
caused by the flooding 
the flooding began with a storm aug 45 that dumped six times 
as much rain on khartoum as the city received in all of 1987 
in cairo the egyptian daily algomhuriya said in an 
unattributed dispatch from khartoum that 400 people had died from 
the flooding the sudanese government has reported 39 deaths 
alahram another egyptian daily quoted sudanese finance 
minister omar nour eldayem as saying the number of people left 
homeless in khartoum and three cities in eastern and northern sudan 
had risen to 2 million 
nour eldayem defended his government against charges it was not 
efficiently handling the distribution of relief he said 
international aid already received was a drop in the ocean when 
compared to the size of the disaster the government has 
estimated the damage caused so far at 200 million 
western relief agencies urged the sudanese government to allow 
nongovernmental organizations help distribute relief supplies 
they said the sudanese army which is handling most of the 
distribution was not reaching some of those affected 
the cairo daily alakhbar quoted unidentified relief agency 
officials as saying the renewed rains together with the expected 
flooding of the nile delayed distribution of aid and shortages of 
electricity drinking water and food creating an extremely 
dangerous situation which was getting worse 
the officials were quoted as saying the army was having 
difficulty distributing blankets tents food and other medical 
supplies and in some cases refused to distribute the relief for 
reasons we do not understand 
news reports friday said hundreds of tons of supplies were 
waiting in khartoum for distribution 
some of those hardest hit by the flooding were nearly 1 million 
people who fled drought and civil war in sudans rural areas to 
seek refuge in squatter settlements ringing khartoum 
one such settlement marzouk west of khartoum was reduced to a 
sprawling collection of crumbling walls and collapsed hovels 
journalists touring marzouk encountered no one among its 15000 
residents who said they received any emergency relief 
we need tents and plastic sheets said abdullahim idris 
kody 32 he said his family had slept outside since floods 
destroyed his tworoom hut 
kody said no food or medicine reached marzouk and children there 
were beginning to develop intestinal problems and coughs 
several soldiers stood outside six orange army tents where a 
young woman said she was handing out less than 2 pounds of wheat 
flour per family daily in addition to supplementary foods including 
sardines dates and sugar 
but no distribution was seen and residents complained the 
rations were being distributed along political lines and only to 
special families 
information on the relief operation in khartoum was scarce and 
it was not possible to determine whether the situation at marzouk 
was typical of other settlements 
abdul mohammed of the sudan council of churches said local 
nongovernmental organizations were trying to care for displaced 
people at the settlements but lacked staff and supplies 
most of the assistance received so far has come from arab 
nations in the form of governmenttogovernment aid 
on friday western deliveries began to pick up with the arrival 
of dutch us and unicef cargo planes carrying supplies earmarked 
for nongovernmental agencies such as the sudan council of 
churches 
mohammed said such groups could handle only 15 percent of the 
displaced populations needs and would help only the most desperate

williams who had suffered from cancer for more than a decade

therapy and at least seven operations virtually to the end he

mr williams was a towering figure in baltimore as the owner of our 
beloved orioles and even though he did not live here he proved 
time and again his commitment to the city through his involvement 
in the local community and more recently signing a longterm lease 
to keep the orioles in baltimore

schaefer read a statement which said in part although he was 
the toughest negotiator i ever encountered he was always true and 
fair in his dealings and this spring he kept his promise to never 
move the orioles by signing a longterm lease which commits the 
ballclub to baltimore for the next 15 years

williams often had lunch said if ever there was a fighter he 
was it he would never give up 
i loved this guy he was just amazing just being around him 
you learned things he was just a wonderful human being zeibert 
said there aint too many like him 
williams enchanted juries befuddled prosecutors defended 
pariahs and befriended the mighty inside the courtroom he beat 
the best the government could offer outside of it he gave his best 
to government performing a variety of tough legal missions abroad

millionaire industrialist victor posner who eventually pleaded no 
contest last sept 29 to evading more than 12 million in federal 
taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a bible college 
as a tax exemption 
sentencing was delayed twice last december after williams 
telephoned the judge to say he was to undergo surgery in washington

committee he served two years as the partys treasurer and the 
washington post the ford motor co and gulf amp western as well as 
gangster frank costello cia director richard helms sen joseph r 
mccarthy and bobby baker an aide to sen lyndon b johnson 
by his own account williams personally lost only one major 
case the 1967 fraud and income tax evasion trial of bobby baker 
an aide to lyndon b johnson williams went home with him baker 
said and burst into tears 
he couldnt stand losing outside the courtroom either as 
president of the redskins he spent to get the best first hiring

the form of pneumonia that kills many 
people with aids is caused by a fungus not by microscopic animals 
called protozoa as many have assumed new studies indicate 
the discovery that pneumocystis pneumonia apparently is caused 
by a fungus could help scientists develop more effective drugs for 
treating the lung ailment said dr jeffrey c edman a researcher 
at the university of california at san francisco 
though the pneumocystis organism was discovered in the early 
1900s scientists have not known whether it is caused by a fungus 
which is a plant form or a protozoan which like a singlecell 
microbe is in the most primitive class of animals 
drugs that rely on antiprotozoan agents are being used 
effectively for treating pneumocystis but the medications such as 
pentamidine and bactrim are often accompanied by side effects 
this finding will allow us to research new areas of the 
cellular processes that are more classically associated with fungi 
and use those as guidelines for new drugs said edman 
edman said his teams findings reported in the current issue of 
the british journal nature also suggest that pneumocystis is 
acquired not from other people but from the environment such a 
finding could help doctors protect those infected with the acquired 
immune deficiency virus from getting pneumocystis 
it is not known how pneumocystis transmission occurs but its 
possible that as a fungus that it may be transmitted from somewhere 
in the environment that it may be growing somewhere we are not 
able to identify said edman 
a protozoan would likely be spread through humantoanimal 
contact or by an insect while fungi are transmitted in the 
physical environment such as in the soil 
a story in sundays editions of the new york times cited other 
doctors similar findings and quoted outside experts as agreeing 
that the findings were important for treatment of aids 
dr donald armstrong an expert in fungal diseases at memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york said evidence that the 
organism is a fungus will provide an impetus for scientists to 
renew their efforts to learn how we might grow it to ease 
testing of drugs

because he believed the statute of limitations had run out 
committed suicide hours after he was convicted of murder 
george l bonner 58 hanged himself in his lake county jail 
cell shortly before 5 am thursday said county police chief james

more time behind bars 
superior court judge richard j conroy had to tell jurors about 
the suicide early thursday when they returned to decide whether 
bonner was a habitual criminal so they could recommend a sentence 
it was very difficult for them and me conroy said 
public defender kevin relphorde said he and jurors reexamined 
the case afterward jurors asked me why bonner didnt take the 
witness stand he wanted to do it but i advised him not to i 
wonder if there are other things i could have done relphorde 
said 
jurors convicted bonner of killing eunice souters 67 and 
othell crenshaw 49 on april 28 1979 in the victims apartment 
the crime had remained unsolved until last year when gary police 
sgt william hlas arrested bonner in an unrelated crime

the nato alliance said friday it is 
committed to sharing of the costs of western defense equitably and 
to maintaining a fair partnership among the 16 member nations 
it released the statement a day after the us senate approved a 
2826 billion military spending bill including an amendment that 
suggests western europe and japan do more for their own defense 
the north atlantic treaty organization statement said equitable 
sharing of defense responsibilities concerns each ally as it is 
in the interest of all that a distribution is balanced 
there is within the alliance continuing commitment to this 
principle as well as recognition of the need to renew efforts to 
maintain under evolving circumstances a fair partnership it 
said 
there has been a growing effort in the us congress to press 
western european countries to allocate more money for defense 
congress has asked for a report by the end of this year on us 
consultations with its allies on burden sharing 
the nato statement said defense ministers have expressed their 
determination to improve collective defense and to ensure that each 
ally contributes in the most effective and equitable fashion 
a european diplomat at nato headquarters expressed concern that 
the senate measure might lead to a reduction in the us commitment 
to western europe and weaken the bargaining position at eastwest 
negotiations in vienna on reduction of conventional military forces 
in europe 
if we start reducing unilaterally then there is no point in 
the russians giving in to western pressure because there is no 
pressure said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the senate amendment orders a major review of us overseas 
commitments and limits the deployment of american troops in japan 
and south korea it also sets a limit on spending for us military 
personnel stationed overseas requiring the allies to pay the 
difference if deployment costs surpass 1988 levels 
a house version of the spending bill approved two months ago 
has no burdensharing amendment the measures now go to a 
housesenate conference committee 
cost sharing has been a frequent topic since nato was formed in 
1949 and there have been calls in congress in recent years to 
withdraw some of the 330000 american military personnel in europe 
nato figures show the proportional of defense spending by 
alliance members varies widely last year the united states 
budgeted 66 percent of its gross domestic product on defense while 
luxembourg provided 12 percent 
britain earmarked 49 percent in 1987 france 4 percent germany 
3 percent and canada 21 percent according to the figures

rep newt gingrich who has pressed for 
ethics investigations of house speaker jim wright called on the 
house ethics panel friday to look into three additional wright 
matters and also into issues involving other house members 
gingrich rga based his allegations on information that has 
surfaced over the past several months through court action and 
testimony regarding congress members news stories and allegations 
by the lobbying group common cause in two cases he called for 
reopening of cases that the house ethics committee has already 
investigated and closed 
those two involved investments and links to the business 
community by rep fernand st germain chairman of the house banking 
committee and the case of rep mary rose oakar dohio who the 
ethics committee said violated house rules in payments made to two 
staff members no disciplinary action was taken in her case 
the ethics panel in april closed the st germain case saying he 
did not abuse his office for personal gain but did understate the 
value of his assets in his personal financial forms no punishment 
was recommended 
gingrich criticized the committees decisions in those two cases 
and said they should be reopened in light of stricter standards the 
committee now appears to be using 
the fact is the house of representatives is increasingly 
invulnerable to public policing members can do virtually anything 
and survive gingrich said at a news conference the week before 
the republican national convention 
the democraticcontrolled house according to gingrich is run 
by a corrupt house machine 
aides to wright did not return a call for comment friday 
regarding wright gingrich said the house panel should look into 
the sale of gemstones through a company in which wright has an 
interest but whose underlying holdings he has not disclosed in his 
financial statements and the purchase of a computer system for his 
washington office from a supporter whose company was not on a 
houseapproved list of vendors 
the speakers office has said the computer was purchased after 
aides did not find the one they wanted on the approved list and 
that the system was installed for demonstration purposes with a 
goal of being eventually approved by the house administration 
committee for use in other house offices 
also regarding wright a texan gingrich said the ethics panel 
should look into the relationship between the savings and loan 
scandal indicted millionaire investors a political action 
committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee 
the ethics committee already is investigating wright for six 
allegations of misconduct 
they include a deal in which he earned about 55000 in sales of 
a book that was published by a friend who had done work for his 
campaigns two cases involving allegations of possible lobbying on 
behalf of oil companies in which he may have had an interest 
allegations of pressuring federal officials on behalf of texas 
bankers and allegations of using a condominium as his fort worth 
home while paying only a per diem and expenses but no monthly rent

about 5000 serbs rallied friday 
in support of slobodan milosevic the hardline leader of the 
serbian communist party in his drive to strengthen the unity of 
yugoslavias largest constituent republic 
the gathering was held near the border of serbias autonomous 
province of vojvodina milosevic recently accused vojvodinas 
leaders of hampering efforts to amend the serbian constitution to 
give serbia greater control over its two autonomous provinces 
vojvodina and the troubled southern province of kosovo though 
formally parts of serbia were given broad administrative autonomy 
under the 1974 constitution adopted while the late josip broz tito 
was president 
serbias leaders want to reduce that autonomy in hopes of 
curtailing ethnic strife in kosovo where the ethnic albanian 
majority is said to be terrorizing the serbian minority and forcing 
a serbian exodus from the province 
we dont want divisions a unified serbia we dont 
give them kosovo chanted the demonstrators many of whom turned 
out in traditional serbian national dress 
it was the third such demonstration in the area since july 9 
all of them were widely believed to have been orchestrated by 
milosevic himself in an effort to demonstrate popular support for 
his policies 
nova pazova a farming community lies less than 15 miles west 
of belgrade in yugoslavias breadbasket region 
earlier demonstrations led to public accusations by the 
vojvodina communist leadership that milosevic was using unethical 
pressure tactics to achieve his goal of a unified serbia 
speaker after speaker at fridays meeting assailed the 
leadership in both vojvodina and kosovo calling the leaders 
cheap opportunists who were unwilling to sacrifice personal 
privilege for unity of the republic

a federal civil rights suit was filed friday 
seeking an end to a patently offensive new police department 
policy of randomly stopping and questioning black teenagers in a 
racially mixed neighborhood 
the suit was filed by a black lawyers group the thurgood 
marshall law association on behalf of walter wade jr 19 
the black teenager was followed and then stopped by police in 
front of his house wednesday but was not charged with any offense 
the suit said 
the suit claims wade was a victim of a policy which was 
patently offensive on its face and lacked any constitutional 
guarantees of protection from undue police harassment interference 
of invasion of privacy freedom of association and to be free from 
undue and illegal search and seizure 
us district judge john potter set a monday hearing on the 
suit which names as defendants police chief martin felker mayor 
donna owens city manager philip hawkey and the city of toledo 
city officials did not immediately answer telephone messages 
seeking comment however felker has defended the policy as 
necessary to stop violence in the neighborhood ms owens and 
hawkey also have supported it 
the suit seeks a temporary restraining order to keep officers 
from carrying out felkers july 8 directive which calls for random 
stopping of black teenagers in the old west end neighborhood the 
order followed complaints by residents who had reported three 
violent incidents involving black youngsters 
wades lawyers also seek 1 million in punitive and compensatory 
damages 
the suit contends the citys policy violates federal civil 
rights law and the first and fourth amendments to the constitution 
which provide for freedom of association and freedom from unlawful 
search and seizure 
about 17 percent of toledos 340000 residents are black and 
the city has experienced racial friction recently 
the interdenominational ministerial alliance which includes 
ministers from a variety of church congregations here recently 
asked the justice department to investigate what the ministers 
called a conspiracy against black officials in toledo 
the group contends that local media and officials have conspired 
to treat blacks differently from whites most notably by firing 
one city employee and disciplining two others for alleged 
mismanagement of city housing programs 
a civil rights group also has been threatening to boycott 
businesses that do not hire and promote blacks as a way of ending 
what it calls economic injustice in toledo

babies who are bottlefed appear more likely to 
develop cancer than those who are breastfed according to findings 
published in the lancet medical journal 
the report published in the aug 13 issue and made available 
friday found that children who were artificially fed or were 
breastfed for less than six months were almost twice as much at 
risk of developing cancer before age 15 than those who were 
breastfed for more than six months 
the researchers determination of a statistical association 
between breast feeding and cancer does not prove that lack of 
breast feeding is a cause of cancer 
the report by researchers margarett k davis david a savitz 
and barry i graubard was based on a study of 201 denver children 
who developed cancer between 18 months and 15 years of age 
the researchers of the national institute of child health and 
human development in bethesda md and the university of north 
carolina at chapel hill nc studied how these children were fed 
as babies compared with how 181 healthy children were fed 
the researchers found a positive association between 
artificial feeding and childhood cancer the report said 
it said however that knowledge about childhood cancer is 
incomplete and that other variables not examined in the study may 
explain the association between artificial feeding and cancer 
it reported a possible source of bias from the parents 
inaccurate recall of breastfeeding duration after many years 
artificial feeding could deprive infants of significant 
immunological benefits which may weaken their natural defenses 
against some forms of cancer the report said 
human milk probably has antimicrobial benefits it said 
if human milk increases resistance to infection in infancy 
artificial feeding which provides no immunological benefits may 
alter the childs responses to early infection 
the interaction of the developing immune system and infectious 
agents may be critical to the individuals subsequent immune 
response to infection or reactivation of latent viral infections 
the report said 
it said the cancer most strongly associated with artificial 
feeding in the study is lymphoma 
the type of feeding also can affect other conditions later in 
life such as obesity diabetes and heart disease the report said 
the researchers said their results differed from those of 
another study by pa mckinney and associates who found no 
association between breast feeding and childhood leukemia and 
lymphoma 
the authors of the new report said their analysis of the 
duration of breast feeding was different and might account for the 
discrepancy in the results

theres no proof anything like the lee 
county lizard man really exists but a man who says he shot it 
faces up to a year in prison and a 1000 fine for unlawfully 
carrying a pistol the sheriff said friday 
lizard man mania has swept bishopville since a 17yearold 
reported being chased by a large green redeyed creature 
sheriff liston truesdale said kenneth orr 26 of florence 
admitted he concocted a story about shooting lizard man because 
he wanted to keep the legend of the lizard man alive 
orr an airman at sumters shaw air force base turned himself 
in about 10 am friday and was charged with unlawfully carrying a 
pistol truesdale said orr later was released on his own 
recognizance until his court date 
he said he was real sorry he caused all that trouble 
truesdale said he didnt know he was going to do all that 
truesdale said he will decide within the week whether to charge 
orr on the misdemeanor charge of making a false incident report 
orr was carrying a 357caliber magnum revolver in his car aug 
5 when he claimed to have shot five times at a creature along us 
15 authorities said 
he told deputies he was on his way to the base when a 
5foot6inch lizardlike creature ran across the highway and made 
a loop toward his car orr said he fired two warning shots before 
shooting three times at the creature striking it in the neck once 
state law allows a person to carry a gun in a glove compartment 
or trunk of a car without a permit the law also allows armed 
forces members to carry weapons when on duty 
truesdale said that orrs gun was lying on the passenger seat of 
his car and that he had no permit 
despite the orr hoax truesdale said he is not ready to write 
the entire story of the lizard man off as fiction 
those people are seeing something out there he said now 
what it is i dont know

wall streeters see more and more signs these 
days that the nation is at or near the peak of the textbook 
economic cycle 
if their analysis is right strong growth in the recent stages 
of an economic expansion that dates back to 1982 has set in motion 
forces that will lead to a slowdown before long 
whether that slowdown necessarily has to turn into a recession 
is a subject of much debate many observers hope a mild setback or 
a soft landing would be enough to set the stage for the next 
period of sustained growth 
but others say the circumstances may make a more pronounced 
dropoff in business activity hard to avoid over the next year or 
two 
growth should remain solid during the second half of 1988 
says donald straszheim chief economist at merrill lynch but 
higher interest rates and a loss of export momentum will take a 
toll by next year growth could stall out by mid1989 
a major risk for next year straszheim says is a 
synchronized slowdown in the industrialized countries 
even before the federal reserve raised its discount rate last 
week from 6 percent to 65 percent chairman alan greenspan had 
made his concerns clear about an economy testing the limits of its 
capacity and the accompanying potential for increased inflation 
by raising the discount rate the fed seemed to signal that it 
was taking a more aggressive approach to restraining growth before 
it gets dangerously unsustainable 
allen sinai economist at the boston co and economic advisers 
inc says the economy is in a full employment zone where 
growth in demands begins to outstrip available supplies as labor 
and product markets reach nearly full utilization 
in the full employment zone the supplies of labor productive 
capacity and finance tighten leading to accelerating wage and 
price inflation and rising costs of finance sinai says 
depending on the source of the economys strength the full 
employment zone can beget behavior that intensifies demands 
ultimately leading to inflationary and other excesses that only a 
major slowdown or recession can arrest 
in the full employment zone sinai adds interest rates 
often rise higher and for a longer period than most expect 
of course the peakofthecycle view is by no means unanimous 
some analysts say that with industrial america having just emerged 
from a prolonged slump strong production activity and demand for 
new production facilities can help keep the economy on track for 
the foreseeable future 
but should the economy start slowing it would most likely bring 
some benefits and opportunities along with the obvious problems 
for one thing it would sooner or later take the pressure off 
inflation and interest rates 
the newsletter blue chip financial forecasts in its august 
survey of the forecasts of dozens of economists around the country 
says interest rates are still expected to move somewhat higher 
as the federal reserve leans against inflationary pressures 
however the consensus forecast shows rates beginning to top 
out by the third quarter of 1989 as economic growth slows abating 
inflationary pressures 
as analysts at wright investors service a bridgeport conn 
money management firm put it 
the federal reserve through its high interest rate policy 
has effectively taken away the punch bowl slow economic growth is 
likely during the rest of this year and the first half of 1989 
however the firm adds if that is the case interest rates 
are likely to be a good bit lower one year from now

oil remains in good supply but fresh 
water is running low in the six arab nations on the persian gulf 
united nations experts are concerned 
the dammam aquifer running like an umbilical cord under the six 
nations provides an estimated onethird of their overall water 
but with all six states sucking up the water faster than nature can 
put it back the experts predict a future far more arid than it is 
now 
man can live without food for two to three months but he 
would die without water for two to three days said ahmed adel 
orabi deputy director of the regional un environmental program 
which is based in bahrain a gulf island 
if extraction continues to exceed recharge the dammam aquifer 
can dry up within 10 to 50 years he said if wellexploited 
it can last forever 
water resources are a problem throughout the middle east riots 
broke out in sudan in july over fluctuations in the water supply 
libya is expecting to invest 25 billion in an underground river 
system some analysts see a danger of wars in the future over the 
areas water resources 
the dammam aquifer stretches the length of the western coastline 
of the persian gulf from kuwait in the north through saudi arabia 
bahrain qatar the united arab emirates and oman 
the reservoir used mostly for agriculture is the source of the 
artesian wells that allowed oases to flourish along the coast for 
hundreds of years 
but oil wealth brought new demands on the water supply as 
economies expanded 
saudi arabia has a daily desalinized water flow of 588 million 
gallons for a population of less than 12 million with its vast oil 
reserves it can afford it 
but states like bahrain still have to rely on nature and 
officials here view the depletion of the dammam aquifer with alarm 
bahrain gets 50 percent of its water from the underground system 
water has been stored in the reservoir over millions of years 
over the past 10 to 15 years it is being bled more than can be 
compensated said jamil al alawi bahrains assistant 
undersecretary for power and water affairs 
bahrains finances battered by soft oil prices have enabled it 
to build only two desalinization plants a third a gift from saudi 
arabia has been delayed 
desalinization plants make it unlikely that anyone in the area 
will go thirsty but the cost of the refined water is prohibitive 
for farm irrigation this means that water from the aquifer could 
be the key to agricultural and economic development 
desalinization plants complement the reservoir they are good 
for drinking purposes but it is the reservoir that helps vital 
development going said orabi there can be no food security 
without water security 
area leaders call for nationwide prayers when the rains do not 
come in the winter while newspaper and television campaigns skewer 
careless users 
television programs remind bahrainis that only 50 years ago 
water used to be hauled in from the kawkabs the sweetwater 
springs gushing from the sea 
water is our most precious source of life when its gone so 
are we said another tv program 
this years rains have been bountiful so much so that tomato 
growers on bahrain nearly lost their crops 
but rains are unpredictable 
the un environmental program hopes to come up with a 
comprehensive plan within two years for conserving the damman 
aquifer and an international agreement might have to be worked out 
to distribute the water among the six nations 
the un plan will also suggest alternative irrigation sources 
such as recycling sewer water it also will seek to reeducate 
farmers on cutting the amount of water used on their fields 
orabi said it is a false concept that land in desert areas 
requires more water for irrigation 
alalawi estimated that bahrains population was growing at the 
rate of 5 percent to 10 percent annually and coupled with a rising 
standard of living water consumption reached a peak of 61 million 
gallons a day last year it is expected to hit 65 million this 
summer its desalinization plants produce a little over half that 
until greater production and conservation redress the situation 
bahrain would have to pump 30 million gallons a day from the dammam 
aquifer to meet demand 
bahrain sits at the edge of the aquifer and drawing too much 
water too fast could allow seawater to seep in alalawi said too 
much salinity in artesian wells is irreversible 
this year and the coming years the situation is critical 
but i wont call it dangerous he said

china 1988 the year of the dragon the 10th in 
the reform years of deng xiaoping 
what is the state of the nation 
a land of great excess and discouraging want encumbered by too 
many people more than a billion with too many expectations 
grappling for too few resources with too little money and not 
enough opportunity for success 
deng now 84 and semiretired says the political economic and 
social reforms he initiated in 1978 have now entered a crucial 
stage 
china must push ahead with price reforms without exacerbating 
doubledigit inflation it must produce more goods while reining in 
an industrial growth rate of 17 percent far greater than the 
nations weak infrastructure and limited financial resources can 
sustain 
china must also give its people more democracy without 
unleashing the already serious problems of unrest and crime that 
accompany a less regimented society 
for all its dramatic changes of the past decade china is still 
an achingly poor agrarian nation where millions have never ridden 
in a car seen an indoor toilet or traveled beyond the next 
mountain 
the government estimates that 60 million people live below the 
poverty line of 150 yuan 40 per person a year in the dusty 
drylands of northcentral china where the late chairman mao 
tsetung built his revolutionary base 50 years ago 30 million 
people still live in caves 
about 20 percent of chinese a number almost equal to the 
population of the united states are illiterate 
but deng thricepurged by mao has transformed the landscape 
since a now legendary communist party conference in late 1978 when 
he consolidated power rejected the primacy of class struggle and 
announced that socialism must be equated with economic development 
not political upheaval and poverty 
deng revived the family farm encouraged free markets and said 
private enterprise is crucial to what he calls a socialist 
commodity economy he has traded off unwieldy central planning 
for production according to market demands 
more recently china has begun experimenting with stock markets 
shareholding land auctions and private housing cities avidly 
compete for foreign investment and already 12000 companies led 
by those from hong kong the united states and japan have invested 
nearly 10 billion in joint ventures and wholly owned firms 
zhao ziyang the new general secretary of the communist party 
speaking at a landmark party congress last fall emphasized that 
china will be in the primary stage of socialism for 100 years 
in effect he gave economists a century to tinker with capitalistic 
business practices 
during dengs decade incomes have more than tripled in the 
countryside to about 450 yuan 121 annually per person and 
doubled in the cities to about 1000 yuan 270 
onefourth of urban households now have color tvs and onetenth 
have refrigerators in 1981 the figure for both was near zero only 
a third of city residents have indoor plumbing but a majority own 
washing machines and tape recorders 
chinas gross national product in 1987 topped 270 billion more 
than double a decade earlier and up 94 percent from 1986 foreign 
trade quadrupled to 80 billion and 17 million foreign tourists 
scaled the great wall and viewed the wonders of ancient xian 
compared to 230000 in 1978 
the most profound changes have come in the countryside where 80 
percent of chinas 107 billion people live deng dismantled maos 
initiativestifling communes and gave the farm back to the family 
the farmer now contracts with the state for a certain amount of 
produce and can sell anything above his quota on the betterpaying 
free market 
dengs assurances that it was no sin to get rich has led to 
10000yuanayear households inconceivable during maos 
ultraleftist cultural revolution in 196676 
despite the successes agriculture problems are crying out for 
a solution the daily publication economic information has said 
grain production after hitting a record 407 million tons in 1984 
fell sharply in 1985 and has yet to fully recover 
bad weather is partly to blame but a key problem is that the 
government while warning that the nation barely produces enough to 
feed itself pays too little for contracted grain farmers have 
little interest in planting rice when they can earn two or three 
times as much growing watermelons for the free market or setting up 
a factory on abandoned grain fields 
beijing is also talking about the need for mechanized 
optimumscale farms meaning largescale production while no 
one advocates bringing back communes there is growing recognition 
that the family farmer scraping away at his average 15 acres with 
his water buffalo and hoe has little room for expanded production

the most visible evidence of reform in chinas cities and towns 
today are the 20 million free market entrepreneurs whose stalls of 
fresh foods and brightly colored clothes clog streetcorners 
china also has 36 million people working for 225000 private 
businesses or entrepreneurs employing eight or more people 
these workers often hired on fixed contracts give up eating 
from the iron pot the lifetime employment system where 
performance is irrelevant for a shot at earning more in a 
profitmaking company 
recent economic reforms have centered on giving factory managers 
more autonomy and adjusting prices to reflect market values rather 
than arbitrary stateset ceilings in both areas progress has been 
slow and arduous 
under the responsibility system factory managers are freed from 
excess interference from beijing or local party secretaries the 
manager and his workers are rewarded for making profits and pay the 
consequences of losing money 
in reality though the manager still depends on government 
indulgences for scarce energy and raw materials and he often must 
sell to the state at unrealistically low prices 
his right to dismiss redundant or unsatisfactory workers is 
rarely used china with an official unemployment rate of 2 
percent strongly prefers having its excess labor force estimated 
at 20 million to 30 million loafing on the job rather than on the 
streets 
price reform highlighted this year by sharply increased retail 
prices for such basics as pork vegetables sugar and eggs has 
been put on hold for the second half of 1988 because of an alarming 
inflation rate 
consumer prices in june were up 19 percent over the same month 
in 1987 the highest inflation figure ever announced by the 
communist government officials say the living standards of 20 
percent of city dwellers declined last year due to rising prices 
still the government insists price reform will continue 
setting price ceilings is imposing the governments subjective 
will on the objective economic life usually departing from the law 
of supply and demand the peoples daily said in july the 
consequences include worsened scarcity of commodities rampant 
black market heavier burden of government subsidies and worsening 
of the social mood 
while china is a decade ahead of the soviet union in economic 
reforms it is struggling to keep up with political changes 
emanating from mikhail s gorbachevs kremlin 
at chinas 7th national party congress last october chairman 
zhao ordered the 47millionmember communist party to end its 
direct controls over bureaucracy and business and stick to a more 
lofty role of setting the nations political course 
the party is also preaching the need for more democracy members 
of local party congresses or legislatures are chosen by direct 
election and the national peoples congress once a rubberstamp for 
party directives has been given greater authority to shape and 
modify bills submitted by the party 
deng remains the ultimate voice on party matters but he also 
led the way in rejuvenating the partys aging leadership ranks last 
fall when he resigned from the fivemember politburo standing 
committee the partys inner circle of decisionmakers 
many conservative hardliners of his generation have faded from 
the scene replaced by universitytrained technocrats in their 50s 
and 60s 
li peng a 59yearold former engineer who in march took over 
the premiership held by zhao ziyang for eight years is viewed as 
more cautious than zhao in introducing market principles in the 
economy 
but as he told japanese reporters in july we all support 
reform of course we might have different views on a specific 
issue and different opinions on steps and methods this is 
quite normal

although the government in 1986 promulgated a nineyear 
compulsory education law it acknowledges it will be decades before 
all children go to school for a complete education currently only 
twothirds of those finishing the sixth grade continue their 
education 
thousands of rural schools are closing because many teachers 
among the lowest paid people in china are resigning and others 
are so poor they cant buy chalk 
the situation is hardly better for the 2 percent of students 
able to attend college dormitories house eight to a room books 
are often unavailable and classrooms are unheated and illequipped 
student discontent erupted in the winter of 198687 with 
nationwide prodemocracy demonstrations 
thousands of disaffected youth are trying to leave the country

republicans assemble in one of americas most 
colorful cities this week to launch george bush and the vice 
presidential partner of his choosing on a comefrombehind quest 
for the white house and to bid hail and farewell to ronald reagan 
not to mention to kick democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis around from one end of the superdome to the other 
after 7 years of laboring in reagans largerthanlife shadow 
bush will be conqueror of all he sees at the 34th republican 
national convention 
his name will be the only one entered into nomination for 
president wednesday night while his rivals from the long ago 
primary campaign nurse dreams of joining the ticket as running mate 
or else take their place in line with the dozens of convention 
speakers 
bush and his high command intend to milk all the suspense they 
can out of the selection of a running mate in large part to 
maximize television ratings for the convention there wont be 
any leaks of this one because im not gonna tell a soul bush 
boasted last week 
the list of contenders runs to a dozen or more names that seemed 
to shift slightly depending on the day illinois gov james 
thompson announced friday that he did not want to be considered 
but former presidential primary rivals sen bob dole and rep jack 
kemp as well as others have been campaigning for the post for 
weeks long shots who say theyre interested include sens dan 
quayle of indiana and pete domenici of new mexico 
there is no doubt that bushs choice of a running mate will win 
approval from the delegates although sen gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire has been threatening a conservative protest if bush 
doesnt pick someone sufficiently to his liking 
bush will depend on surrogates to rough up dukakis who holds 
the lead in virtually all public opinion polls he has tapped dole 
former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick and sen phil 
gramm of texas sarcastic tormentors of the democrats among 
others to rough up his opponent 
new orleans known for its jazz its mardi gras and its 
restaurants has been planning for the republican invasion for 
months 
even bourbon street where jazz halls compete for customers 
with the seedy burlesque houses has prettied itself up to a 
point there are lots of weirdos here but everyone should see 
them its hot but excellent said jeff levy a delegate from los 
angeles in town a few days ahead of the rest of the pack 
democrats have decided to stay away from new orleans unlike 
republicans who held daily news conferences at the democratic 
national convention last month to take potshots at the proceedings 
dukakis will tend to statehouse duties in massachusetts on monday 
and tuesday but campaign in the midwest and elsewhere during the 
final two days of the gop convention 
republicans have spared no expense in mapping out a convention 
designed to maximize bushs chances of victory in the fall 
the podium where the vice president will deliver his acceptance 
speech next thursday night was built at a cost of more than 
500000 its red white and blue color scheme was designed with 
television in mind as was almost everything else 
the vice presidents high command has choreographed a delicate 
dance to dramatize the passing of the republican torch from reagan 
to bush 
thus they have turned the first night of the convention over to 
reagan the man who twice led the party to landslide victories 
with bush watching at home in washington the delegates will see a 
videotaped tribute to the president then reagan will address the 
delegates and the prime time viewing audience 
he is expected to describe in glowing terms the accomplishments 
of his two terms and contrast them with the 21 percent interest 
rates runaway inflation and malaise that he and bush inherited 
from the democrats in 1981 
tuesday morning bush will arrive in new orleans and meet reagan 
briefly before the presidents departure for california from then 
on it will be bush center stage 
republicans will approve their platform tuesday a conservative 
blueprint that rules out higher taxes says no to abortion and 
affirms bushs intention of deploying star wars 
with bush advisers providing cues from just offstage 
republicans spent their preconvention week drafting a 30000word 
document designed to contrast with the barebones democratic 
platform gop chairman frank fahrenkopf said the platform would not 
be all that different from the one reagan ran on in 1980 and 1984 
although planks dealing with aids health care and education were 
inserted at bushs direction 
were a conservative political party fahrenkopf said 
were proud of that were not afraid of the c word 
tuesdays convention program includes kirkpatricks speech as 
well as an address by former president gerald r ford and the 
keynote address by new jersey gov thomas kean 
wednesday night will mark bushs formal victory in a roll call 
of the states that will end in a unanimous endorsement of his 
candidacy television evangelist pat robertson the only other 
candidate to arrive in new orleans with pledged delegates will not 
have his name entered in nomination and will speak to the 
convention tuesday night 
bush will have his name entered into nomination by gramm with 
seconding speeches to be delivered by a football coach a hispanic 
woman a congressman from california and bushs son jeb and his 
wife among others 
the official convention schedule does not call for bush to visit 
the hall wednesday night although his aides say they are 
considering a late night appearance at which he would dramatically 
disclose his running mate to the waiting world

in raising the discount rate the federal 
reserve dashed the hopes of a large percentage of middleclass 
americans especially those in industrial jobs says a pioneer in 
consumer behavior studies 
their expectations fell right through the floor said albert 
sindlinger 
sindlinger had just finished three days of telephone interviews 
358 in all that lasted from 15 to 18 minutes each in which 
americans were asked about their finances and expectations 
conditioned as he was to hearing bad news sindlinger 
nevertheless was shocked by the computer analysis of the results 
the very people we needed to help we hurt the most he said he 
said it was a tragedy 
these people he explained are ordinary american workers with a 
small amount of savings and investments but no stocks or mutual 
funds many of them are buying houses financed by adjustable 
interest loans 
that he suggested was enough to lower expectations about their 
economic wellbeing six months from now but there was more many 
had just recently climbed up out of the financial hole they saw 
themselves tuumbling back down 
sindlinger who began his telephone interviews more than three 
decades ago developing over the years a reputation for using such 
data to make economic projections observed that two years ago many 
of these people were jobless 
in late 1986 for example his interviews suggested that no less 
than 31 states most dependent on manufacturing oil mining or 
agriculture were in recession 
disguising the plight of these states at least in the national 
statistics were the good times experienced in the coastal areas 
the latters results smoothed out the negatives being reported from 
the interior 
by the fall of 1987 however all but four states were out of 
recession onceidle bluecollar workers found jobs and others 
moved up from lowpaying servicesector jobs to better paying 
positions in manufacturing 
job data offer some documentation 
from aug 2 1987 to aug 1 1988 sindlinger amp co in 
wallingford pa found a 1724 percent increase in production 
trade and craft jobs in manufacturing the category showing the 
next biggest rise was operators fabricators and laborers 
these are the people hurt the most by the discount rate 
increase sindlinger said first he said their hopes were raised 
and then they were dashed they feel betrayed he said they feel 
like theyve been hit with a onetwo punch 
all of them expect a decline in household income within six 
months he said they fear their savings will diminish they fear 
bigger expenses 
in his opinion the federal reserve made a terrible mistake in 
raising the discount rate to 65 percent from 6 percent first he 
said inflation was not that big a threat secondly he said the 
fed misread the employment data 
the fed he said believed that inflation was roaring because 
weekly earnings went up last month but he said this was not a 
case of wages rising in an inflationary manner it was he said 
simply the upgrading of jobs 
as he put it workers who had been flipping hamburgers in the 
service sector found betterpaying jobs moving pipes around in the 
manufacturing sector 
these are politically important people he continued they are 
swing voters he said they put reagan and nixon in office and 
they could do the same with dukakis 
seldom an admirer of the fed sindlinger prepared to offer 
clients of his weekly service a personal opinion he wrote 
the uss fed shot down the us economy airbus over the gulf of 
ignorance using its trusty discount rate surfacetoair missile 
responsibility must be placed on the shoulders of the 
commanders for gross errors of judgment

the nations retailers were in something of a 
lull this past week as they readied or released earnings reports 
and prepared for the fall selling season 
this down time could be the calm before a storm some wall 
street analysts warn that if the industry doesnt soon pull out of 
its slump it could see further takeover attempts and 
consolidations 
there were no surprises from the stores secondquarter results 
walmart stores inc which has excelled while other stores lagged 
reported a healthy 34 percent increase in earnings 
may department stores co said its secondquarter net income was 
about even with the same period of 1987 while fw woolworth co 
reported a 16 percent increase the apparel retailers limited inc 
and gap inc said their earnings fell 46 percent and nearly 19 
percent respectively 
analysts said the results were about as anticipated and no cause 
for alarm 
jeffrey edelman who tracks retailers for the investment firm 
drexel burnham lambert inc said even with the lackluster 
sales things did not turn out to be as bad as might ordinarily 
have been expected 
many retailers have had disappointing earnings the last few 
quarters overall retail sales have been sluggish for about a year 
and a half as consumers have paid off large credit card balances 
and because of uncertainty about the economy apparel retailers 
have also been hurt because their lines for last fall and spring 
bombed out 
analysts say many companies have saved their profits from 
further erosion by keeping inventories lean and trimming their 
expenses but others are struggling and are vulnerable to 
possible takeovers 
one potential target is zayre corp the nations eighthlargest 
retailer which recently warned its shareholders it expects to 
report a substantial loss for the second quarter 
earlier this month zayre said dart group corp chairman herbert 
haft who has made a string of unsuccessful takeover bids for 
retailers had notified the framingham massbased company he 
plans to purchase at least 15 million of its stock 
in past months zayre has been rumored to be a possible target 
of walmart shopping center developer edward j debartolo jr and 
texas investor robert m bass 
zayre has been weighed down by problems within its discount 
store division the company which faces stiff competition from 
other discount retailers has been unable to find a merchandising 
strategy to distinguish itself from the crowd 
analysts say zayres stock price which is trading in the 
low20 range is depressed and that the company with several 
different divisions could easily be broken up this all makes 
zayre an attractive takeover candidate 
also vulnerable are apparel retailers if the stores continue to 
lose sales this season it will accelerate the trend toward 
consolidation predicted monroe greenstein an analyst with bear 
stearns amp co inc 
fred wintzer an analyst with alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore said small privatelyheld retailers with five to 200 
stores are in a particularly precarious state after what he called 
the worst 12month period in the history of womens apparel 
these companies were making enough money to stay in business 
before wintzer said but now theyre losing a lot of money 
retailers that recognize their vulnerability and that are in a 
position to protect themselves are doing so most prominent among 
them is may department stores which was considered a likely target 
following campeau corps takeover of federated department stores 
inc earlier this year 
may seems to have learned from federateds mistakes and has 
begun paring divisions that dont fit with its strategy or that are 
unprofitable 
the nations seventhlargest retailer announced recently it was 
selling its loehmanns specialty store chain and analysts expect 
other divisions including its southern californiabased jw 
robinsons department store chain to go on the block may is also 
searching for a buyer for onehalf of its interest in 28 shoppings 
malls 
i definitely think what theyre doing is defensive said 
edelman of drexel burnham 
but the company still has work to do in an analysis of may last 
month linda kristiansen of dean witter reynolds inc estimated the 
breakup value of mays stock what it would be worth if its 
divisions were sold off at 54 a share may shares which are 
currently trading in the mid30s are still undervalued ms 
kristiansen said

they werent your ordinary runofthemill 
quarterly treasury auctions 
the federal reserves surprise hike in its key discount rate 
this past tuesday caught the bond market offguard and wreaked 
havoc on the three auctions of treasury securities that followed 
the move analysts said 
the government bonds were not well bid many foreign investors 
who play a critical role in financing the nations 25 trillion 
debt apparently were driven away from the sales 
the fed really threw the market a curve ball and did it at 
the last minute said robert brusca chief economist and senior 
vice president of the fixedincome division at nikko securities co 
international inc 
he likened the impact of the discountrate boost on the auctions 
to what godzilla did to tokyo 
the increase in the discount rate the interest the fed charges 
on loans to major financial institutions was the first such hike 
since last octobers stock market crash a rise in interest rates 
sends bond prices lower 
the central bank raised the rate a halfpercentage point to 65 
percent in order to stem inflationary pressure on the economy 
many market watchers had expected the fed to tighten its reins on 
the money supply but few were anticipating that dramatic a move 
consumers felt the ripples two days later on thursday when the 
nations major banks responded by upping their prime lending rates 
to 10 percent from 95 percent the prime rate is used as a 
benchmark for a range of loan charges for consumers and businesses 
such as home mortgage rates and credit card interest fees 
bond investors meanwhile were feeling shock waves the three 
auctions on tuesday wednesday and thursday made up the 
treasurys thirdquarter refunding aimed at raising cash to finance 
the federal debt the government sold a total 29 billion in 3year 
notes 10year notes and shortterm cash management bills 
the discountrate move and the economic uncertainty it stirred 
up couldnt have come at a worse time analysts contend 
the auction results were pretty dismal said elizabeth 
reiners a vice president at dean witter reynolds inc the demand 
that everybody had thought was out there pretty much dried up at 
the auctions 
the government issues fetched low prices driving up interest 
rates on the bonds to skyhigh levels 
yields on the 11 billion in 3year treasury notes on the 
auction block climbed to the highest level in three years the 
average yield was 877 percent up sharply from 823 percent at the 
last comparable auction on may 10 
another 11 billion in 10year notes didnt fare much better 
their average yield rose to 927 percent up from 906 percent at 
the last similar sale on may 11 and the loftiest level in nearly 
three years 
foreign investors especially the usually bondhungry japanese 
seem to have stayed away from the auctions in droves 
they stayed home said ward mccarthy chief financial 
economist for merrill lynch capital markets 
the 50 percent or so participation by foreign investors that 
usually marks the quarterly auctions shrunk in half traders said 
compounding the problem was the absence of 30year treasury 
bonds normally a staple of the quarterly sales and a favorite of 
japanese investors 
since the treasury has used up almost all its congressional 
authority to issue longterm securities it was forced to strike 
30year bonds from the slate of the auctions

newspaper ink made from soybean oil is a runaway success but 
the high price of soybeans is likely to drive up the price of soy 
inks forcing some publishers to return to the petroleumbased 
variety 
the choice may be purely economic for large metropolitan papers 
like the boston globe which switched to soybased inks exclusively 
for its color printing work about a year ago 
but the issue could become stickier for rural newspapers in the 
farm belt where printing with soybased ink is seen as one way of 
helping the local soybean growers 
its pretty hard not to commit to the farmers here said lon 
myers director of operations for the cedar rapids gazette one of 
the first newspapers in the country to use soy ink in early 1987 
but myers said everything is subject to evaluation theres 
obviously some business judgment that has to be used 
so far ink manufacturers have been willing to absorb the sharp 
droughtdriven increase in soybean oil prices just to get customers 
to try soy inks and many have approximately 600 us newspapers 
are using soy ink for color reproduction said wilson cunningham 
research manager for the reston vabased american newspaper 
publishers association which developed soybased ink in response 
to environmental concerns about petroleumbased inks 
soy inks in the most frequently used colors blue red and 
yellow sell for 250 to 3 a pound about 5 percent more than 
their petroleumbased counterparts newspapers say the superior 
performance of the colored soy inks offsets the slightly higher 
cost 
black soy ink at about 90 cents a pound costs nearly twice as 
much as black petroleum ink and hasnt caught on with newspaper 
publishers as far as quality comparisons black is black 
myers said in a telephone interview 
the midwestern drought has withered soybean crops and pushed the 
price of crude soybean oil up dramatically on the chicago board of 
trade from about 21 cents to about 27 cents a pound since the 
start of the year 
in a crop production report released thursday the agriculture 
department estimated soybean oil prices for the coming 
octoberthroughseptember marketing year would average 255 cents a 
pound the usda estimated soybean oil production for the period at 
111 billion pounds 14 percent less than estimated production of 
129 billion pounds for the current marketing year 
despite the lower production surplus stocks of soybean oil 
should be adequate said stan pendlum an economist with the st 
louisbased american soybean association 
herb edelman vice president of operations for the united states 
printing ink corp a national ink distributor based in east 
rutherford nj said the price of soybased inks likely will rise 
in time 
i think well have to address that before the end of the year 
after the situation stabilizies he said 
jm huber corp of edison nj another major manufacturer of 
newspaper ink also has held the line on its soybased inks despite 
the rise in soybean oil prices 
were hoping the drought is a temporary blip and soy oil 
prices will come down to ordinary levels said dennis sweet 
hubers market specialist for newspaper inks 
the boston globe would almost certainly switch back to 
petroleumbased ink if the price of soy ink rose significantly 
said john bopp the newspapers quality control manager 
bopp said the color capabilities of new petroleum inks approach 
the quality of soy inks 
traditionally the cheapest price buys the ink at most 
newspapers said cunningham of the anpa 
the superior quality of soybean inks may make someone be 
willing to pay a higher price but its hard to say he said 
on the other hand both cunningham and myers pointed out that 
petroleum ink prices may also rise many energy market analysts 
expect crude oil prices to increase after the iraniraq ceasefire

as they have demonstrated anew in the past few 
days wall street investors are a tough group to please on the 
subject of inflation 
in the bond market especially inflation is public enemy no 1 
because it erodes the value of money invested in longterm assets 
with fixed face values 
and when the bond market suffers from inflation fears so 
usually does the stock market 
but what happens when the federal reserve and other central 
banks in leading industrialized countries take a militant stance 
against inflation and back up their words with action 
if you take tuesdays increase in the discount rate by the fed 
as a case in point the markets react with dismay 
one prominent concern is that in their zeal to keep inflation in 
check policymakers will tighten credit enough to cause a 
recession at some point down the road 
but some optimistic forecasters dont buy that argument they 
contend that a modest pinch now by the fed could forestall the 
necessity for a crunch later on 
statistics reported to date suggest that inflation in this 
country is creeping up but not accelerating rapidly 
there was some uneasy reaction in the markets friday when the 
government reported that the producer price index rose 05 percent 
in july 06 percent if you exclude food and energy prices which 
are prone to erratic shortterm fluctuations that dont indicate 
any lasting trends 
the big worry on the street these days is that the robust pace 
of economic activity will soon quicken the pace of prices as it 
strains labor and production capacity 
however some analysts contend that these fears are unjustified 
the economy is strong but strong for the right reasons 
maintains michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton inc 
the inflation picture itself is still not a problem despite 
all the rhetoric 
we think that inflation must be watched but we do not see 
reasons for higher interest rates at this time and we believe 
there may emerge forces that could bring long rates eg on 
bonds down from present levels 
as edward yardeni at prudentialbache securities put it 
growth is good thats our motto 
were trying to recruit as many people as possible to repeat 
it 10 times each morning so that it might become a selffulfilling 
prophecy frankly we need all the help we can get because the 
growth is bad camp has many more believers 
yardeni and the other optimists got little help from the stock 
market in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
fell 8161 points to 203752 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 456 to 
14853 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 876 to 37895 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 847 at 29648 
volume on the big board averaged 18008 million shares a day 
against 15581 million the week before 
actually some analysts point out the response on the street to 
tighter credit hasnt been entirely negative 
while all interest rates have been moving up lately they point 
out longterm rates have not risen as fast as shortterm rates 
that suggests to some observers that the feds antiinflation 
efforts might be successful and beneficial to the financial 
markets over time 
were impressed with the macho approach of the central 
bankers said yardeni 
we expect that the aggressive actions of the central bankers 
will increase the chances that our sustainablegrowth and 
stableinflation scenario will prevail

the government announced major 
steps friday to shore up the economy including a 15 percent 
increase in fuel prices and higher surcharges on luxury imports 
consumer and business groups complained that the increase in 
fuel prices would halt a recent decline in the inflation rate 
which has fallen from 17 percent in 1987 to 124 percent 
the black consumers union said the fuel price increase would be 
a particular hardship to poor blacks who rely on lamp fuel to light 
unelectrified homes 
george bartlett deputy minister of economic affairs said the 
price for highoctane gasoline will increase by 159 percent to 
about 160 a gallon similar increases in lowoctane gasoline and 
other fuels will be introduced 
finance minister barend du plessis and economic affairs minister 
dawie de villiers announced a separate package of economic 
measures including restrictions on installment purchases to curb 
borrowing and higher surcharges on imports such as motor vehicles 
tobacco televisions coffee tea and jewelry 
on many items the existing 10 percent surcharge will be raised 
to 60 percent 
the ministers said the steps had been caused by high domestic 
spending which placed pressure on interest rates and led to 
increased imports 
if consumers curtailed spending they said the government could 
avoid further and more painful steps 
the higher consumption had boosted imports of crude oil and 
moved south africa away from desired levels of energy 
selfsufficiency bartlett said 
south africa is the target of international oil embargo but 
imports an estimated 3 billion worth of oil a year it does not 
disclose details of its oil needs 
economists say the increased fuel imports have been a major 
factor in a recent severe reduction in south africas balance of 
payments surplus south africas currency the rand has weakened 
as a result and the cost of imported fuel has risen 
business organizations conceded the need for a fuel price 
increase but said the announced rise was excessive 
in a separate development the government announced it would 
implement a new labor bill sept 1 despite ongoing negotiations 
between employers and black trade unions to resolve disputes over 
the legislation 
the labor relations amendment would effectively outlaw sympathy 
strikes and consumer boycotts in connection with labor disputes 
a committee of employer representatives had agreed to recommend 
that the government remove six controversial sections from the bill 
the countrys two largest black labor federations responded by 
calling on employers to pledge that they would not invoke some of 
the provisions in the bill that could weaken unions 
they called the governments decision to implement the bill 
despite the negotiations amounted to pandering to minority 
rightwing interests

a new yorkbased investment firm and a 
broker in maine were fined 110000 after being charged with 
selling unregistered stocks and misrepresenting a risky stock to 
investors maines attorney general said friday 
the investment firm gruntal amp co and portland broker richard a 
liberty neither admit nor deny guilt to the charges outlined in the 
consent decree which was signed thursday by superior court justice 
morton brody 
attorney general james e tierney said the complaint filed in 
kennebec county superior court alleged that gruntal and liberty on 
more than 100 occasions sold to maine residents stock in a computer 
software company that was unregistered in the state 
although gruntal and liberty told investors that the stock in 
microshare corp of utah was an excellent investment it was 
actually highly speculative and risky because microshare is a 
new company in a highly competitive market said the attorney 
generals complaint 
rufus e brown lawyer for gruntal and liberty took issue 
friday with the charge that liberty misrepresented the stocks he 
said most if not all buyers signed statements in which they 
indicated they understood the stocks were speculative 
the consent decree orders liberty to pay at least 20000 of the 
fine and gruntal to pay at least 75000 liberty is a cousin of 
portland realestate developer michael liberty according to the 
defendants lawyer

unregistered securities in maine

a frozen poultry producers decision to call its 
bitesized pieces chicken tenders violated burger kings 
exclusive right to the name a us district court jury concluded 
friday 
the jury which deliberated for about four hours following eight 
days of unorthodox and amusing testimony rejected pilgrims 
prides claim that chicken tenders is a generic term and should 
not be subject to trademark regulations 
alan greer an attorney for miamibased burger king corp said 
the fastfood giant will file motions within 30 days seeking an 
order from judge eugene spellman to prohibit pilgrims pride from 
using the name 
the company also will request payments equal to the profits 
pilgrims pride received on the 45 million in boneless chicken 
morsels sold since early 1986 said greer 
in the meantime greer said dallasbased pilgrims pride uses 
the chicken tender name at their peril 
burger king is very pleased by the verdict said burger king 
spokesman doug timberlake reading from a prepared statement 
but pilgrims pride chief executive officer lonnie bo 
pilgrim maintains that the tender or tenderloin breast is an 
accepted name used in the poultry industry for many years 
the jury missed the point said pilgrim it puts us in a 
situation of not knowing what to call our product burger king 
learned about the name tender from the chicken industry 
pilgrim said the company has not decided if it will appeal the 
verdict ending the nineday trial which included technical debate 
over chicken anatomy and a dramatic dismembering of a raw bird 
throughout the trial jurors were presented with tough talk 
about the mysterious 2inch tenders by a parade of 
entertaining witnesses discussing poultry linguistics and 
advertising color texture and even aftertaste were examined 
miamibased us department of agriculture spokesman harold 
havner testified he believed tenders was a generic term 
in turn burger king attorney louis pirkey claimed pilgrims 
pride used the name tenders to ride the coattails of a 20 
million burger king advertising campaign launched in early 1986 to 
hail the arrival of the chicken tenders around the nation 
you might say they had 20 million reasons to call it chicken 
tenders said pirkey last tuesday 
i dont steal responded pilgrim a texas farmer who 
oversees the 20000poundanhour pilgrims pride processing plant 
in one of the most dramatic moments of the trial university of 
arkansas professor tommy lee goodwin on tuesday dismembered a 
plucked 3pound bird with a butchers knife to give jurors an 
intimate look at the disputed section of the chicken technically 
known as the pectoralis minor 
spellman had to give written permission to allow the carving 
knife into the court building 
people who know chickens will still be calling them tenders no 
matter what the jury said pilgrim said

longterm interest rates have risen to an eightmonth high in 
response to the labor departments report that wholesale prices 
rose at a 57 percent annual rate in july 
the yield of the treasurys closely watched 30year bond rose 
friday to 942 percent its highest point since 944 percent on 
dec 11 1987 rounding out a bad string of performances for the 
bond market 
its just been a lousy week said mitchell held chief 
financial economist for smith barney harris upham amp co referring 
to the slide in the bond market 
inflation fears made for a bad week on wall street as well the 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 178 to 203752 
extending its loss for the week to 8161 points 
the dollar was mixed friday against major foreign currencies 
while oil futures prices declined 
in another indication of rising rates a nationwide survey 
friday found interest rates on new oneyear adjustablerate 
mortgages surged this week to 8 percent the highest level since 
last november 
fixedrate mortgages jumped to 1057 percent just below the 
peak of of late may and early june according to the survey by the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
on the inflation front the labor department said the 05 
percent rise in its producer price index in july occurred in spite 
of smaller increases in food prices that compared with a rise of 
04 percent in june 
analysts were concerned that unlike previous months the 
biggest increases were not in the normally highly volatile food and 
energy sectors but across a wide spectrum of consumer and capital 
goods 
drugs mens clothing tires soaps cosmetics home electronic 
equipment glassware tobacco products and construction equipment 
all rose at annualized inflation rates in the double digits 
these prices will slow down but something else will pick 
up the slack said donald ratajczak director of economic 
forecasting at georgia state university theres a lot of 
inflation kicking around
