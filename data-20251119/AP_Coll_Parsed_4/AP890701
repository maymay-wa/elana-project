us sen alfonse m damatos hometown on long 
island will return 1 million in department of housing and urban 
development funds that were earmarked to build a swimming pool the 
new york times reported 
island park officials requested earlier this week that their 
application for the pool be withdrawn citing local opposition to 
the project and rising costs the times reported in its saturday 
editions 
the officials denied that the cancellation was spurred by a 
federal inquiry into hudsponsored projects on long island 
including in island park the times said 
island park was awarded the 1 million in grants for the pool 
last year after damato a village resident personally lobbied 
thenhud secretary samuel r pierce the times said 
the money for the pool came from pierces discretionary fund in 
a letter to village residents last fall damato praised pierces 
wise decision to approve this grant the times reported 
the pool was to have been built near a beach 
an assistant to hud secretary jack kemp said kemp was pleased the 
pool project was dead 
we think the funds can be used for a purpose that will be more 
in line with assisting lowincome individuals mary brunette the 
assistant told the times

damatos office friday afternoon 
in island park investigators are looking into allegations that

in the inlets of prince william sound exxon co 
workers flush gooey crude from the craggy shore back into the sea so 
it can be skimmed 
the glop which has the consistency of mayonnaise is mixed with 
sediment seaweed and other flotsam but instead of being burned or 
buried some of it is going to a seattle refinery where it can be 
salvaged as fuel 
theyre probably going to try to get every nickel they can 
even if its turned into asphalt to try to recover some of their 
costs said doug johnson a scientist with the us environmental 
protection agency in anchorage 
id rather see them refine the stuff than incinerate it or put 
it in a landfill johnson said in a telephone interview its 
still fuel it still has heat potential 
nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude smeared alaskan 
waters three months ago and almost 1 million gallons of fuel 
slicked three sites within 13 hours last weekend 
environmentalists and oil company executives may cry over the 
spilled cargo but salvagers are going to work recycling as much of 
it as they can 
its better to use it for its intended purpose than have it 
otherwise foul the environment out of these tragedies wed like to 
see the best made out of a bad situation said clifford curtis 
president of the oceanic society 
the ooze is piling up after the latest tanker accidents 
about 210000 gallons of goop was put in storage tanks near 
galveston texas after the panamanian tanker rachelb collided with 
a barge in the houston ship channel 
the material is relatively clean said lt cmdr chris nelson 
of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 
in rhode island the coast guard has stored about 10 million 
gallons of fuel and a blend of oil and water skimmed from 
narragansett bay after the greek tanker world prodigy hit brenton 
reef the ships owner is working on a salvage plan 
our job is to keep it out of the water were not sure how much 
can be recycled said lt paul wolf 
the stickiest problem may be the 243802 gallons of gunk 
recovered from the delaware river after the uruguayan tanker 
presidente rivera dropped anchor too soon and lurched into shallow 
water 
the fuel is so heavy it must be heated before it can be pumped 
when it mixed with water the spillage congealed into 
basketballsized fudgelike clumps the state of delaware set up 
four temporary disposal sites and it probably will be buried or 
burned officials said 
that stuff coming out of the river is nonrecyclable its 
ruined it has no value said bob caron of guardian environmental 
co in bear del 
in the calamitous alaskan spill procedures are simplified 
because exxon owned the tanker and the cargo that gushed into the 
sea 
exxon has shipped about 2 millions gallons of goo that is 30 to 
50 percent oil to northwest enviroservices co in seattle for 
refining the brew contains water sand seaweed and other junk 
scooped up by the skimmers but it can still be refined into 
gasoline kerosene and diesel fuel 
we would expect to derive some useful energy out of it said 
roger dragnich waste manager for exxon in valdez but the value 
of recovery is inconsequential in terms of the cost of the cleanup 
and environmental damage youre trying to have the least overall 
negative impact 
once we remove the water and debris it can be used in a wide 
spectrum of petroleumrelated uses said steve banchero president 
of northwest enviroservices one of our foremost goals is to 
reduce the volume that has to be disposed of 
exxon has been burning some nonrecyclable oily trash at three 
small hospital incinerators in valdez while it tries to obtain 
federal permits to fire up large furnaces on barges burial is 
costly because alaska has no hazardous waste sites crudetainted 
garbage is being shipped to oregon 
even recycling carries a high price tag 
its very costly to recycle oil loaded with lots of junk the 
cost of refining may be way beyond the value of the oil said jack 
gould of the american petroleum institute an industry group

faced with the wrath of crabby cabbies miffed 
motorists and irate casino owners officials hope a new curfew will 
detour thousands of cruisin teens who transform the glitzy las 
vegas strip into a giant parking lot 
two years ago the teenagers were considered a nuisance by las 
vegas metro police as they tried to control cruising and 
congregating 
then we were talking about 500 maybe 1000 kids on a weekend 
night said metro capt barbara connett who is commander of the 
police detachment covering the strip area it was a manageable 
number now were talking upwards of 4000 kids on a given night 
the problem has mushroomed out of proportion 
the problem is blamed on the strips growing popularity among 
teens and the growth of the city from 300000 eight years ago to 
more than 700000 today 
the numbers were overwhelming connett said we tried to 
control the blocking of the strip but all we could do was herd them 
up and down the strip unless people were willing to hire 500 more 
officers to bolster the current strip contingent of 16 
casino owners are unhappy because the teens sometimes hassle 
tourists often bumping them into the busy strip traffic connett 
said 
cab drivers complain it takes forever to drive a few blocks as 
teens drive sidebyside down the sixlane road at 5 to 10 mph 
exchanging conversations obscenities even passengers 
the traffic problem is compounded by the fact that 45 percent of 
the citys visitors come here by car leaving more than 10000 
cars hundreds of cabs and scores of tour buses jockeying for 
position on any given weekend 
in addition teenagers who used to cruise past casinos on 
fremont street also known as glitter gulch now drive the strip 
because they were chased away by anticruising forces in the late 
1970s 
flooded with letters from upset tourists and hammered by those 
who make a living from the citys 25 billion tourism industry the 
chamber of commerce huddled with county officials and police in 
search of a solution 
it came down to finding a way to get the kids off the strip 
earlier connett said what were talking about here is an 
adults only park in a manner of speaking 
the answer was a curfew restricting those under 18 from the strip 
after 9 pm fridays saturdays and holidays unless accompanied by 
an adult 
the curfew went into force june 23 and police reported many 
warnings but no arrests for curfew violations connett said 
officers will warn teens about the curfew for an unspecified grace 
period before turning offenders over to juvenile authorities 
teens with legitimate purposes on the strip such as visiting 
restaurants are exempt as long as they can explain their presence 
violators will be detained until their parents pick them up and 
repeat offenders will be sent to juvenile hall 
unhappy teens who have become accustomed to sharing the 
neonbathed strip that some call a disneyland for adults have 
responded to the cruising ban with the generationsold response we 
have no place to go nothing to do 
thats idiotic connett says its the dumbest thing ive 
ever heard out of a kids mouth this city has probably done as much 
or more for its kids than any city in the country 
some children could be in the center of disneyland and say they 
have nothing to do she said connett noted the city has snow 
skiing and water skiing 30 minutes away plus a water theme park 
free parks recreation centers movies ice and roller skating 
rinks arcades and other attractions 
but las vegas teens or at least a vocal minority want to head 
for the flashy strip to mingle with some 100000 tourists who flock 
here each weekend

honey breske is trying to make ends meet by 
recycling but prosecutors have taken the 92yearold widow to court 
over the pile of trash in her yard 
now she is looking for a job to earn the money for the court 
battle 
spry widow seeking any employment her advertisement 
reads need funds to fight housing court they wont let me 
recycle cans for cash 
mrs breske placed the ad in a weekly newspaper after the city 
went to court to force her to clear debris from her yard where she 
keeps aluminum cans boxes and other junk she recycles to supplement 
her 369 monthy social security income 
her neighbors complained about the mess 
i dont think its fair these things didnt happen until our 
husbands died mrs breske said then they started picking on 
us 
one of mrs breskes friends jean dunlap is in trouble with the 
city for the same reason the court has issued a permanent 
injunction against storing debris in her yard and issued more than 
10000 in fines over the last 12 years 
i cant pay nothing said ms dunlap 70 
city attorneys handling such cases say many elderly residents are 
turning up in housing court accused of creating dangerous piles of 
refuse in attempts to earn money 
we have one to two cases every week with this type of 
problem said dolores quiroz the assistant corporation counsel 
prosecuting mrs breske and thats a conservative estimate 
sometimes its one or two a day 
the city gets involved in cases where debris poses possible fire 
and health hazards 
it was not just a matter of cans and things like that she 
said the problem is that they keep collecting it and its 
causing serious problems with the neighbors 
mrs breske finds recyclable items by rummaging through alleys in 
her neighborhood she started collecting about 10 years ago just 
after her husband harry was hospitalized for a heart attack 
he died five years later leaving mrs breske with a 45000 
hospital bill she emptied her bank account and sold jewelry to help 
pay it 
i went looking for a job a couple of times when i told them my 
age they said what do you want to work for she said so i 
got tired of that i said ill just go pick cans

police arrested at least seven striking eastern 
pilots and employees friday as they stopped their cars in a baggage 
area at atlantas big airport on one of its busiest days 
it is a grassroots movement said hank weber a spokesman for 
the eastern pilots union in miami some disgruntled eastern 
strikers including nonunion people are trying to show their 
frustration 
those arrested were charged with misdemeanors disobeying an 
officer and impeding the flow of traffic and nearly all of the 
arrested were pulled from cars at an eastern baggage area at 
hartsfieldatlanta international airport 
other strikers gathered signatures on petitions that called for a 
continued boycott of the airline which has been crippled by a 
fourmonth strike 
we asked them to move along but they wanted to shut down this 
airport said police maj wb shannon this was an obvious 
attempt by the union to hurt the citizens of atlanta we dont like 
it and were not going to take it 
airport spokesman john braden said friday was one of the busiest 
days in hartsfields history with about 140000 travelers passing 
through the airport 
in new jersey about 300 eastern strikers and supporters marched 
on friday to newark international airport and blocked evening 
rushhour traffic heading to the terminal of continental airlines 
easterns sister airline 
about 50 police wearing riot gear and holding night sticks tried 
to keep the crowd moving through the airports roads and another 50 
tried to control fridays rush hour traffic there was no violence 
and no arrests were reported 
the intent is to tell everyone in the whole world that 
easterns still on strike said ed borowick president of local 
1445 of the international association of machinists 
borowick said the union was under a courtordered limit of 15 
pickets per entrance but marchers took over the four traffic lanes 
where passengers debark to get to continentals departure counters 
for about an hour 
similar plans to greet miami travelers with airport slowdowns 
failed to materialize a few strikers drove slowly through miami 
international airport but they were moved along by special police 
teams 
in new york easterns boss frank lorenzo warned that striking 
pilots who might want to come back to work likely will find theyve 
already been bumped from their jobs 
were not dependent on the pilots coming back by any means 
said lorenzo chairman of easterns parent company texas air corp 
pilots union officials were to meet this weekend with management 
and easterns courtappointed bankruptcy examiner for talks on a 
contract agreement to end their walkout against the company 
weber said the slowdown wasnt sanctioned by easterns unions 
which mark four months on strike july 4 but strikers from the 
pilots flight attendants and machinists unions said they would 
drive their cars slowly through airport terminal areas on friday 
afternoon and possibly next tuesday 
ron gunther operations director at miami international airport 
said extra police officers and tow trucks were called out to lessen 
traffic tieups he said holiday travelers should leave an hour or 
so earlier than usual to allow for possible delays 
if the unions pull off this blockadetype activity my reaction 
would be theyre making the traveling public the innocent victims in 
a labormanagement dispute eastern spokesman robin matell said 
eastern meanwhile was gearing up for a tripling of its daily 
schedule with 79 daily flights this week eastern was set to hit 
226 daily flights beginning sunday 
we have to see whether they can make the announced schedule and 
whether they can sustain it for seven days weber said watch 
for cancelled flights they dont have enough pilots 
the carrier has been operating less than 10 percent of its 
prestrike schedule of around 1000 flights a day since the strike 
that started march 4 it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization on march 9 and says it will rebuild as a smaller 
airline 
in an interview friday lorenzo said any returning strikers would 
find most of the available jobs at the new scaleddown eastern were 
taken up by the 500 or so new hires and 300 who crossed picket lines 
who already are working and by other pilots who will complete 
training in the weeks ahead 
eastern also is near agreement with creditors over its plan to 
emerge from bankruptcy court protection as a scaleddown carrier 
that would require only about 1700 pilots to operate by december at 
its target level of around twothirds of its prestrike size that 
compares with the 3600 that flew the prestrike version 
the unions are backing a buyout bid for eastern led by chicago 
commodities trader joseph ritchie

the energy department has tentatively agreed to 
pay at least 73 million to ohio residents who claimed damage by 
radioactive contamination from a governmentowned plant near fernald 
that produces nuclear weapons materials 
a lawsuit filed by five residents as a class action had sought 
300 million 
the settlement underscores the governments intensified effort to 
regain public confidence in its nuclear weapons program which is 
run from 17 major plants in 12 states many of the sites are badly 
polluted from four decades of bomb making 
the government has acknowledged that at least 383000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium oxide dust had been released through faulty 
filters at the fernald facility since the plant opened in 1951 the 
full extent of environmental damage has not been determined 
louise roselle one of the attorneys for the 14000 people living 
within five miles of the plant who are represented in the class 
action said the settlement allows for an additional 5 million 
payment to nearby businesses if they can show lost property value 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said the terms were 
approved by energy secretary james d watkins late friday and would 
be presented to us district judge s arthur spiegel in cincinnati 
next week 
watkins has said he would step up department efforts to resolve 
past environmental damage from nuclear weapons plants and limit 
future harm 
its a major concern to us said moore this whole idea of 
this lawsuit with people being upset diminution of property values 
all these kinds of things would not have occurred if we had done 
it right in the past 
watkins earlier this week blamed his own department for disarray 
in the weapons program saying key managers and supervisors lacked 
technical skills and some lacked the necessary discipline for safe 
operation of nuclear reactors 
the congressman whose district includes the plant predicted more 
lawsuits by people who live near contaminated bomb factories its 
a tragedy that the taxpayers are bearing the brunt of 35 years of 
contamination and concealment said rep tom luken dohio 
in the ohio lawsuit residents near the feed materials production 
center at fernald about 18 miles northwest of cincinnati said 
radioactive contamination from the uranium plant polluted soil air 
and water in their area they claimed this caused them mental stress 
and reduced the value of their property 
moore said he sympathized with the publics concerns about 
possible illegal pollution from nuclear weapons plants but he 
expressed doubt about the fernald claims 
a lot of that is hysteria he said there really wasnt 
judging by what i heard a lot of hard evidence of anybody losing 
anything as a matter of fact almost none 
he said he believed the settlement if made final would be the 
first of its kind 
judge spiegel scheduled an aug 23 hearing on the agreement if 
the judge approves the settlement the government must deposit the 
money into four cincinnati banks no later than oct 15 said roselle 
a us district court jury in cincinnati earlier this month 
recommended in a mock trial that the fernald residents be awarded 
136 million the recommendation was issued as a nonbinding 
verdict a procedure used in ohio to encourage settlement of a 
lawsuit before it goes to trial 
the plant was run for the energy department by national lead of 
ohio inc until 1986 
the residents group filed suit against national lead and its 
parent company but the department of energy has accepted 
responsibility for its contractor because of an indemnification 
clause in its contract and the government has provided defense 
counsel to its contractor

the hard lesson of the passing years is that it has not been 
enough to wage a war against the old forms of bigotry and 
inequality the president said before flying off for a long 
holiday weekend in maine 
bush called on congress to join me in a new partnership to 
reauthorize the civil rights commission with a goal of launching a 
renewed civil rights mission 
the commissions sixyear authorization expires nov 30 
civil rights leaders jesse jackson martin luther king iii 
benjamin hooks vernon jordan and james farmer attended the ceremony 
the landmark civil rights law was signed by president lyndon b 
johnson on july 2 1964 the act banned segregation in public 
accommodations and paved the way for court action to end bias in 
hiring and promotions 
also in the audience was rosa parks whose defiant refusal to 
move to the back of a montgomery ala bus on dec 1 1955 was an 
early milestone in the civil rights movement 
bush said the gathering was not only to commemorate an 
anniversary but to celebrate a movement and to rededicate our 
efforts to the unfinished work of that movement 
however some civil rights leaders say recent supreme court 
decisions restricting affirmative action and making it more 
difficult to prove discrimination in the workplace have hurt the 
civil rights movement 
there was more damage done to civil rights statutes in the last 
2 weeks than in the last 2 decades said ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
bush did not directly address civil rights leaders concerns but 
called for vigilant and aggressive enforcement of civil rights 
and said his administration wont tolerate discrimination 
jackson told reporters that justice had become more expensive 
more distant and less likely to come because of the high court 
rulings 
he said we need a meeting of some substance with the president 
to deal with legislative remedies to offset the impact of the 
supreme court decisions 
but some said bush seems more interested in defending the flag 
than the ideals the flag represents alluding to his call for a 
constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the flag 
so far they have put flag rights over workers rights over 
basic civil rights jackson said after the ceremony 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in chicago earlier this 
week that the bush administration wont pursue legislation to 
overturn the recent high court decisions affecting civil rights 
preferring to wait until their impact can be assessed 
bush said economic barriers affect the lives of the disadvantaged 
as much as the remnants of legal discrimination 
for that reason i continue to support affirmative action and 
minority outreach programs bush said we will be satisfied with 
nothing less than equality of opportunity for all americans and 
the removal of final barriers to selfreliance

nearly 20 years after sen edward kennedys car 
plunged off the bridge at chappaquiddick island several grand 
jurors who investigated the accident have come forward to say the 
district attorney hindered their probe 
one of the jurors robert e maciel said friday that there was a 
cover up in the case but said he believed kennedy was the 
victim not the perpetrator 
i think the man is innocent maciel said i dont believe 
kennedy was driving that car i think he took the blame for somebody 
else 
mary jo kopechne a 28yearold secretary was a passenger in 
kennedys oldsmobile when it skidded off dike bridge in marthas 
vineyard on july 19 1969 trapped in the vehicle she drowned in 8 
feet of water in a tidal pond 
the massachusetts democrat who did not report the accident to 
police until 10 hours later received a suspended sentence for 
leaving the scene 
maciel and the grand jury foreman leslie h leland said former 
district attorney edmund dinis prevented the 23member jury from 
calling several key witnesses including kennedy and his cousin 
joseph gargan jr because they had previously testified at an 
inquest 
leland a 49yearold pharmacist on marthas vineyard said 
dinis the dukes county prosecutor also refused to let the grand 
jury read the transcript of the inquest 
when those two avenues were closed off there was nothing for 
us to do really but go home leland said 
dinis who is now in private practice in new bedford did not 
return telephone calls from the associated press to his home and 
office friday 
he previously has denied stonewalling the investigation and has 
said there was not enough evidence to justify indicting kennedy for 
manslaughter 
leland and maciel said they have spoken out after two decades 
because they want the truth to come out and to clear the grand 
jurys name 
ive lived with this thing for 20 years and there have been 
all these innuendos that we were bought off leland said the 
bottom line is the grand jury tried its hardest to get to the 
truth but we were not able to do our job 
kennedy has said he made a wrong turn that night and ended up on 
the narrow dike bridge he also has said that he and a friend 
repeatedly dove to the car in unsuccessful rescue attempts and that 
afterward he was exhausted and in a state of shock 
maciel who owns a boatyard on marthas vineyard said he did not 
believe that kennedy a frequent visitor to the island would have 
made that wrong turn he said he did not know why kennedy would have 
taken the blame for someone else unless it was someone very 
young 
the standard times of new bedford also reported friday that 
several other jurors have backed statements by leland criticizing 
the investigation 
it was a coverup said lloyd mayhew a grand juror now living 
in mattapoisett i support every single word mr leland said 
everybody covered for kennedy 
leland was quoted in the july 3 issue of newsweek as saying that 
two unidentified key lawmen took him for a ride and told him 
there was no need for a thorough investigation 
he said friday he stood by that account 
helen mosher a tisbury housewife told the new bedford newspaper 
that the jury experience left her disgusted 
what took place took place but it shouldve been handled 
differently she said i got a lot of questions from people but 
id say nothing people said you got paid off and all that but i 
let it go over my head

the department of housing and urban 
developments inspector general says the agency ignored repeated 
warnings for tighter controls on lenders in a troubled program now 
under house investigation 
on at least five occasions we have reported to hud 
management and to congress that program improvements were needed 
said hud inspector general paul a adams as the house government 
operations housing and employment subcommittee began hearings friday 
on the program 
the program known as coinsurance because the government 
assumed part of the liability on loans with lenders showed signs of 
problems two years after it was instituted in 1983 as a hallmark of 
reagan administration efforts to turn the functions of many 
government programs over to private business 
a november 1985 internal audit of eight projects showed 
inappropriate lender underwriting practices caused inflated 
mortgages adams said 
the subcommittee has been examining possible abuse 
influencepeddling and mismanagement in hud programs during the 
reagan administration 
hud officials promised to improve lender monitoring processes 
and enforcement actions although they rejected adams assessment 
of the problems and said controls he suggested were so strict they 
would discourage participation he said 
lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a projects 
operating income as an incentive to repair rehabilitate or build 
low and moderateincome multifamily housing 
if a borrower defaults lenders are responsible for about 20 
percent of the loss while hud picks up the tab for the remaining 80 
percent 
hud now faces more than 100 million in claims against bad loans 
made in the program said rep tom lantos dcalif subcommittee 
chairman 
in the most recent audit in march 1989 adams found the benton 
mortgage company of knoxville tenn had misrepresented mortgage 
amounts and rents on 14 projects it had underwritten creating an 
estimated 22 million in excessive mortgages said adams 
he said the government would pay excessive subsidies of 37 
million over the 15year period of contracts for rental housing 
benton had coinsured 
benton is one of three companies which has been placed on six 
months probation from the program three companies have been 
suspended and three others are under review by hud adams said 
adams revealed friday that benton is the subject of a grand jury 
investigation which he said he would not discuss 
adams said his first report of problems in the coinsurance 
program was sent to thenassistant secretary of housing phil abrams 
one of several former hud employees who was paid as a consultant on 
projects funded under the moderate rehabilitation program 
rep bruce morrison dconn observed that abrams used benton 
in all of his deals in that program 
meanwhile congressional pressure is mounting for a complete 
review of the housing department 
one staffer said senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee chairman donald riegle dmich has sent a letter to 
panel members seeking authorization for an investigation 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the banking housing 
and urban affairs subcommittee on housing said friday he would vote 
for a probe of the scandalridden department 
and house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said hud secretary jack kemp would testify before his panel july 12 
to discuss reform measures being developed in the agency

the national space council has decided to urge 
president bush to keep the space plane alive but limit its 
development program to the testing of unproven technology 
the program is aimed at the development of a plane capable of 
taking off from a conventional runway going into orbit and landing 
on a regular runway 
president reagan called it the tokyo express for the 
projected twohour flight time from new york to tokyo 
defense secretary dick cheney proposed eliminating the project or 
transferring to the national aeronautics and space administration 
most of the 427 million proposed by reagan in the pentagon budget 
for the next fiscal year 
the council recommended the project get 254 million next year 
shared equally by nasa and the defense department the washington 
post said in its saturday editions a spokesman for vice president 
dan quayle chairman of the council said friday night he did not 
have dollar figures for the recommendations 
the senate armed services committee recommended 412 million 
with 127 million from nasa 
a council staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the programs focus had expanded over the past four years so that 
nutsandbolts questions like payload were being considered before 
researchers had proven with an experimental craft that the plane 
would be able to fly at 25 times the speed of sound 
nearly 2 billion has been spent on the program over the past 
four years potential contractors have spent 700 million of their 
own funds

defense secretary dick cheney is proposing a 
broad overhaul of top pentagon committees that would give a small 
group the power to make major decisions according to an 
administration source 
cheney responding to president bushs request for a review of 
defense management recently sent the white house a proposal to form 
an executive committee that would assume many of the powers of 
the current defense resources board the source told the associated 
press late friday 
we are waiting for the presidents decisions the source said 
the defense resources board which advises cheney on major 
weapons and budgetary decisions would become the defense planning 
and resources board with a broader planning task 
it would be subordinate to the executive committee which would 
be comprised of the secretary the deputy secretary the 
undersecretary for policy the undersecretary for acquisitions the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the secretaries of the 
army navy and air force 
these are the people who are setting the policy anyway said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
cheney also would reorganize the defense acquisitions board in an 
effort to streamline the lines of authority in procurement in 
carrying out acquisition policies down through the service 
acquisition chiefs and program managers the source said 
the acquisitions board would scrutinize the cost and performance 
tradeoff decisions made in the early stages of a weapons program 
the service secretaries would be dropped from the acquisitions 
board cut out of the loop but at the same time they would be put 
back in at the top through membership on the executive committee 
the source said 
the source largely confirmed an account of cheneys plans first 
reported friday night by defense news a weekly journal of defense 
policy and politics

the bush administration says it is looking for 
help from the palestine liberation organization in holding elections 
on the west bank and gaza 
if they can be responsible and constructive here in helping 
great margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
friday while defending two unannounced meetings in tunis with salah 
khalaf the secondincommand to plo chairman yasser arafat 
but supporters of israel accelerated their criticism of the 
expanded dialogue us ambassador robert pelletreau is having in 
tunisia with plo officials 
thomas a dine executive director of the american israel public 
affairs committee said we are deeply distressed to learn that the 
administration has conducted secret meetings with the founder of 
black september one of the most brutal terrorists of recent years 
dine said in a statement that khalaf known also as abu iyad 
has publicly boasted of his terrorist deeds against americans and 
israelis and bragged about his ability to deceive the united 
states 
the head of the proisrael lobbying and research group called the 
meetings in tunis a blow to the confidence necessary to move the 
peace process forward 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations called khalaf a notorious 
terrorist and said bringing him into the talks can only breed 
mistrust and cast suspicion on the depth of our countrys 
longstanding commitments to israel 
on thursday israeli ambassador moshe arad registered his 
governments regret and disappointment in a meeting with assistant 
secretary of state john kelly arad told the us specialist on the 
middle east the meetings hurt prospects for holding the elections 
the elections were proposed by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and endorsed by president bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii as a way of getting peace talks started 
the idea is to have the 14 million palestinian arabs living 
under israeli control on the west bank and in gaza choose leaders 
who would negotiate temporary and local selfrule israel the 
palestinians egypt and jordan would negotiate a permanent 
settlement in a second stage of talks 
the plo has publicly criticized the plan as a device to prevent 
creation of a palestinian state 
spokeswoman tutwiler claimed only limited progress in the talks 
i have no reason to believe that it has not been constructive 
she said 
the us official said pelletreau had held several unannounced 
meetings with various plo officials and was likely to hold others 
our objective in the dialogue is to advance the peace process 
and to underscore our expectation that the plo will adhere to its 
renunciation of terrorism she said

a new york pharmaceutical company says its 
employees appear to have won government approval for one of the 
firms generic drugs for treating high blood pressure by 
substituting the brandname product for its own in comparison tests 
it would appear that that is the case roger w jordan 
president of vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield gardens 
ny said friday 
jordan said he believes the companys drug which has been 
recalled is safe 
a congressman however said the case raises questions about the 
drugs safety as well as the governments drug approval process 
the drug is a generic dyazide a widely prescribed treatment for 
high blood pressure smithkline beckman corp of philadelphia 
developed dyazide and marketed it for 20 years before the first 
generic version was approved two years ago vitarine was approved in 
february 1988 
vitarine recalled its product a month ago at least three 
employees have been suspended the company said 
however jordan said preliminary results of a justcompleted 
comparison study measuring the rate and extent of absorption of the 
two drugs shows that vitarines product falls within an acceptable 
range 
vitarine has no reason to expect any safety or efficacy 
problems with this product vitarine has produced millions of dosage 
units since the product was first introduced in february 1988 and as 
of this date has received only six adverse experience reports he 
said 
jordan declined to elaborate on the findings of the companys 
internal investigation except to confirm that the company told the 
fda it suspected dyazide was substituted for vitarines product in 
comparison tests as a result dyazide would have been tested 
against only another sample of dyazide 
the chairman of the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee which brought the possibility to public light 
thursday said the case raises questions about how the fda approves 
generic drugs 
events suggest that we can no longer be assured that the 
products tested are the products marketed said rep john dingell 
dmich subcommittee chairman 
that such a simple but apparently effective fraud could have 
gone undetected raises some serious new questions about the safety 
and efficacy of these drugs and about the law he said 
the fda acknowledged that it is investigating the company but 
spokesman jeff nesbit said he couldnt comment on the inquiry or 
address the safety of the vitarine drug 
an fda source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
agency doubted the generic version was unsafe because it had 
undergone other tests and no problems with people using it had been 
reported

the secret service does not know who authorized 
a private white house tour allegedly given to members of a 
homosexual prostitution ring now under federal investigation a 
spokesman says 
the focus on private white house tours came after the washington 
times reported that prominent washington lobbyist craig j spence 
arranged tours of the white house once around midnight for 
friends and business associates 
the paper reported in its friday editions that one such group 
included two male prostitutes from escort services that are now the 
subject of an investigation by us attorney jay stephens 
secret service spokesman allan cramer said friday that staffers 
holding white house passes can escort guests through the west wing 
site of the oval office at special times but he said records from 
the reagan administration when the tour in question allegedly 
occurred are no longer available 
one unidentified man quoted by the times recalled a tour late on 
the night of july 3 1988 
cramer said the secret service did not know who vouched for the 
party that night because all white house records from the period 
including visitors logs have been shipped to california for 
eventual placement in the ronald reagan library which has yet to be 
constructed 
the times said credit card records it obtained show that spence 
frequently patronized a homosexual prostitution network that ran the 
escort services 
spence once a registered foreign agent for japan is known as a 
washington powerbroker whose parties during the reagan 
administration attracted prominent individuals including former cia 
director william casey journalist ted koppel and james lilley the 
ambassador to china 
stephens and the secret service confirmed thursday they are 
investigating possible credit card fraud involving the escort 
services which operated under names such as dream boys and 
man to man 
the investigation is based on records seized in raids on a house 
in an upscale washington neighborhood that police say was used by 
the services police seized numerous bank statements credit card 
slips and a diary of the business 
the times reported the ring was patronized by reagan and bush 
administration officials and congressional aides paul r balach 
resigned his job as labor secretary elizabeth doles political 
personnel liaison to the white house on thursday after his name 
appeared in the times original story on the investigation 
spence spent thousands of dollars on the escort services the 
times said on oct 5 1988 for instance he made four separate 
payments totaling 1525 with his american express card for male 
escorts from professional services inc it said 
in the bush administration white house staff members can bring 
guests on private tours of the west wing on monday wednesday and 
friday between 7 pm and 10 pm after 1 pm on saturday and all 
day on sunday cramer said 
before a guest is cleared into the white house compound a staff 
member must provide agents with information such as a date of birth 
and social security number

a federal judge has cleared the way for oliver 
norths sentencing next wednesday in the irancontra scandal 
north facing up to 10 years in prison and 750000 in fines 
lost a bid for a mistrial friday 
us district court judge gerhard gesell said no evidence existed 
that a juror who gave the court inaccurate information was biased 
against the former white house aide 
juror tara leigh king responded no last feb 1 when asked 
whether she or relatives had been involved in court proceedings or 
an investigation 
norths lawyers disclosed after his trial that one of kings 
brothers had served time in prison for armed robbery and that the 
woman had testified before a grand jury in connection with the 
criminal investigation of her brother 
she testified wednesday she forgot about the episode when she 
answered the courtroom questionnaire feb 1 gesell said in a 
ninepage order that kings testimony probably wasnt believable 
but that it didnt matter in deciding whether she was biased against 
north 
the court cannot credit kings testimony her omission was 
knowing but she had no desire to help or to hurt north or the 
prosecution gesell said in a ninepage order 
no proof was presented indicating that king was unfair or that 
she failed in any way to serve conscientiously he added 
north was convicted may 4 for aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress altering and destroying documents and illegally 
accepting a gratuity 
north had moved for the mistrial saying king was prejudiced 
against north 
she voted to acquit north of many felony counts gesell said 
of king 
north was acquitted on nine other charges 
the judge said that embarrassment and a desire to serve on the 
jury rather than forgetfulness were the reasons king failed to 
disclose the background information last february 
norths lawyers hired a private detective agency to investigate 
her background after she told a television interviewer she had used 
drugs adding that she had stopped months before norths trial 
situations of this type arise with some frequency in cases when 
the defense has ample resources said the judge they must be 
resolved in favor of the verdict when bias against the defendant has 
not been established in fact or by implication

us rep donald e lukens is confident of 
winning an appeal despite receiving a 30day jail term for having 
sex with a 16yearold girl an aide said 
the 58yearold republican was freed on a 100000 surety bond 
friday 
franklin county domestic relations court judge ronald solove 
sentenced lukens to the maximum penalty on the misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the unruliness of a child but overturned lukens 
conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor 
william jarrell lukens chief of staff said in an interview 
from washington that the dropping of the delinquency charge was a 
very good sign for our appeal 
solove citing lukens apparent lack of remorse told the 
congressman he was convinced you are a sex offender 
the court was struck by the unwillingness of the defendant to 
recognize that he was not the victim solove said you have 
refused to take that degree of responsibility 
lukens who is divorced was convicted may 26 for paying rosie 
coffman 40 to have sex with him at his columbus apartment on nov 6 
solove sentenced him to 180 days in jail and a 1000 fine but 
suspended all but 30 days of the sentence and 500 of the fine 
lukens was placed on probation for one year 
solove said the suspended sentence and fine depend on whether 
lukens follows terms of his probation which require him to 
participate in sex offender programs and submit to testing for 
sexually transmitted diseases 
lukens left the courtroom without commenting to reporters but 
jarrell said the congressman had no need to show remorse 
when congressman lukens conviction is overturned at the 
appeals level judge solove will then understand why he showed no 
remorse he is innocent he said 
mrs coffman whose complaint about lukens led to his indictment 
was escorted from the room immediately after the hearing she is 
serving a jail term for violating probation stemming from a 1983 
drunken driving conviction 
conviction on a misdemeanor does not automatically bar lukens 
from congress he has vowed to remain in office and pursue his 
appeal 
local republicans have called for lukens to resign and the house 
ethics committee has been asked to investigate the case 
lukens served two terms in congress from 1967 to 1970 when he 
lost a bid for the gop gubernatorial nomination after 15 years in 
the ohio senate he was returned to congress by voters in 1986

death and were not terminally ill 
dr allen jay argued that artificial administration of nutrition 
and hydration is not the same as using extraordinary medical means 
to keep a patient alive the san diego physician gained national 
attention when he refused a court order to withhold food and water 
from a 92yearold alzheimers patient whose daughter wanted to end 
her life 
jay said it was important that physicians know they have the 
right to follow their moral and ethical conscience 
having a physicians role in society defined by legislators or 
attorneys is a terrible terrible thing he said we are all 
responsible for our own actions regarding our own conscience 
david n osteen the committees executive director urged 
members to oppose euthanasia as strongly as they do abortion 
withholding artificial administration of food and water is 
really starving people to death said osteen the logical next 
step would be lethal injection he maintained 
when we come to this point it will be too late he said 
the time to act is now because society at large has not yet 
accepted the stark reality of what is being done

shooting its way through hundreds of thousands of unarmed protesters 
the government says about 300 people were killed half of them 
soldiers chinese witnesses and western diplomats say the deaths

workers to stand atop the gate which along with the square was

attorney general dick thornburgh has decided 
that a member of the irish republican army should be deported to the 
united kingdom where he has been convicted and sentenced to life in 
prison for killing a british soldier 
thornburgh overruled an immigration appeals board finding that 
joseph patrick thomas doherty could reopen proceedings to seek 
political asylum 
but doherty cannot be deported immediately because of a pending 
legal challenge to a 1988 deportation order by thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii said justice department spokesman david runkel 
the challenge is pending before the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals in new york 
in my discretion i would not grant the respondent asylum 
thornburgh said it is the policy of the united states that those 
who commit acts of violence against a democratic state should 
receive prompt and lawful punishment 
deporting doherty to the united kingdom would unquestionably 
advance this important policy thornburgh wrote 
the state department had previously determined that deporting 
doherty is in the foreign policy interests of this country 
the doherty case has been the focus of political controversy 
particularly among a group of house members from new york city who 
contend he should be treated as political refugee 
dohertys supporters were upset by thornburghs decision 
rep eliot l engell dny said it was an outrage that flies 
in the face of american justice 
its morally legally and politically indefensible said 
peter king republican comptroller of nassau county in the suburbs 
of new york city thornburgh is allowing the justice department 
and the american legal system to be an accessory to margaret 
thatchers british government 
sen orrin hatch rutah has also urged thornburgh to grant 
dohertys request for political asylum 
doherty 34 was convicted of killing a british army captain 
during a 1980 ambush of british troops in ulster he escaped from a 
prison in belfast the next year and was arrested in new york city in 
1983 he has been held in federal custody since then 
thornburgh overruled a nov 14 board of immigration appeal ruling 
that doherty could reopen his request for political asylum 
the immigration and naturalization service began deportation 
proceedings in 1984 after a federal judge in brooklyn ny ruled 
doherty could not be extradited because his crime was a political 
act that made him eligible for asylum

state attorneys say they will fight a 
judges decision to overturn a law requiring parental consent for 
abortions performed on minors in a case that could be affected by a 
longawaited supreme court ruling 
the parental consent law passed by the general assembly in 1988 
was to have taken effect today two days before the us supreme 
court was expected to announce action on a missouri law seeking to 
limit legalized abortion 
the statutes vagueness can be expected to have a substantial 
chilling effect upon a minors right to obtain an abortion us 
district judge john t nixon said friday in a ruling made after 
about an hour of oral arguments 
the national planned parenthood federation and the american civil 
liberties union of tennessee challenged the law seeking a 
preliminary injunction blocking its enforcement if the issue had not 
been decided friday 
deputy attorney general michael catalano said the state will 
consider an appeal to the 6th us circuit court after reviewing 
nixons opinion 
its our contention that the statute is constitutional he 
said we intend to pursue the case to that end 
catalano also said the case could be affected by an upcoming 
ruling from the us supreme court on a missouri law that restricts 
the availability of abortions and defines life as beginning at 
conception the justices could rule monday or order another round of 
arguments delaying the decision until next year 
if they rule well read it with interest catalano said 
lynn ray executive director of tennessee volunteers for life 
said his citizens group which lobbied for the 1988 legislation 
may ask the general assembly to pass a new version of the parental 
consent law next year 
the law would have made it a misdemeanor for a doctor to perform 
an abortion on a girl under age 18 without obtaining written 
permission from both her parents or her legal guardian 
the statute allows exceptions however if the parents are 
divorced if the pregnant girl wins a court waiver of the consent 
requirement or if one parent cannot be found within a reasonable 
time and manner 
the phrase reasonable time and manner is so vague as to fail 
to give the physician notice as to when his actions will violate the 
statute and subject him to criminal sanctions the judge said 
that violates the doctors right to due process under the 14th 
amendment he said 
nixon said uncertainty about the laws meaning would lead doctors 
to protect themselves by denying abortions to minors who cant 
locate one of their parents 
the judge ruled on every single ground on which we alleged the 
law was unconstitutional said dara klassel attorney for planned 
parenthood 
two cases pending before the supreme court involve parental 
consent laws in ohio and minnesota 
the ohio abortion law generally requires doctors to notify a 
parent before performing an abortion on a young unmarried girl 
passed by the state legislature in 1985 the ohio law never took 
effect due to a successful legal challenge by an akron abortion 
clinic and one of its doctors 
the minnesota law requires some girls to tell both parents at 
least 48 hours before having an abortion a federal appeals court 
upheld the law but postponed its rulings effect while the supreme 
court reviewed it 
according to court papers parental notification or consent laws 
are in effect in alabama indiana louisiana massachusetts 
missouri north dakota rhode island utah and west virginia 
a challenge to a florida parental consent law is under 
consideration by that states supreme court

a federal appeals court has lifted a ban on 
drug testing for justice department employees who have topsecret 
security clearances 
however the court friday left intact a permanent injunction on 
random drug testing for justice department lawyers responsible for 
conducting grand jury proceedings and employees who prosecute 
criminal cases 
the court suggested that the department consider limiting testing 
to personnel who handle drug prosecutions 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the department would 
consider seeking further court review of parts of the opinion with 
which we disagree or to refocus the program 
the departments plans for random drug testing covered about 
1300 employees with topsecret clearances as well as about 400 
criminal prosecutors and 750 personnel with access to grand jury 
information 
in a decision written by chief us circuit court of appeals 
judge patricia wald the court rejected the departments request to 
lift the injunction issued by a federal district court last summer 
the injunction resulted from a lawsuit by 38 justice department

new york states legislature voted today to 
let staten island residents vote on whether they want to secede from 
new york city and form their own government 
residents of the smallest of new york citys five boroughs can 
vote in november 1990 if the bill is signed by gov mario cuomo 
the bill allowing the secession vote passed the state assembly 
early today by a 11622 vote after passing the state senate 
cuomo has not indicated how he will act on the measure said his 
spokesman gary fryer 
the secession movement gathered force earlier this year after the 
us supreme court ruled that the citys board of estimate was 
unconstitutional because it gave staten island with fewer than 
400000 residents equal representation with brooklyn the most 
populous borough with more than 22 million residents 
the restructuring being prepared under the ruling could diminish 
staten islands voice in city government 
the other new york boroughs are manhattan queens and the bronx

mass as an innercity pastor said he saw a new beginning in the 
merger of his church with another one closed by the detroit

mass sunday 
at least one parishioner was angry 
i disagree strongly with the closings and especially with the 
way its being handled said patricia dorsey a parishioner for 5

one to have a greater affect on the surrounding community 
dorsey was among the throng of catholics who packed a courtroom 
wednesday when circuit judge james hathaway refused to block the 
closings the group took its plea for an injunction to the state 
appeals court on friday the court isnt expected to rule before the

ferdinand marcos fever has subsided but doctors 
say they cant tell yet whether his condition has improved after an 
operation to remove his transplanted kidney 
the former philippines president was being kept alive by daily 
dialysis treatments which do the job of his failed kidneys and 
extract waste from the blood eugene tiwanak assistant 
administrator at st francis medical center said friday 
the operation was performed thursday because doctors believed 
marcos lifethreatening fever of up to 104 degrees was caused by 
his bodys rejection of the donated kidney he received in 1984 
marcos temperature subsided to around 100 degrees but he 
remained semicomatose and was unable to recognize people tiwanak 
said 
the doctors feel its too soon to say there has been an overall 
improvement in his condition as a result of the surgery said 
tiwanak marcos was still in very critical condition and the 
prognosis remained poor he said 
earlier marcos spokesman roger peyuan said three doctors told 
imelda marcos her husband was slightly better following surgery 
hes a little better just soso still very critical mrs 
marcos said as she left the hospital early friday morning 
but she was unresponsive to reporters when she returned to the 
hospital friday night when asked how her husband was doing mrs 
marcos said she was at the hospital to sign a release for marcos 
medication 
tiwanak said marcos could survive indefinitely with the use of a 
dialysis machine marcos also was hooked up to a resirator and other 
lifesupport equipment tiwanak said 
marcos suffered liver failure wednesday and suffered heart lung 
and kidney failure in may he has remained in the hospital since 
being admitted jan 15 
one of marcos doctors who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said the exiled leaders condition has generally worsened over the 
past five months 
its like a stair step the doctor said he gets worse 
levels off gets worse and levels offs but sooner or later hell 
fall off the steps 
another doctor also speaking on the condition of anonymity 
called marcos survival remarkable 
he really does have a tremendous will to live the doctor 
said i can honestly say that just about any other person in his 
condition would have been dead months ago theres no real 
explanation 
the marcoses were indicted in new york last year on federal 
racketeering charges they stand accused of stealing more than 100 
million from their homeland to buy art and real estate in manhattan 
marcos illness has led him to be separated from the case mrs 
marcos is free on 5 million bail 
the couple fled here in 1986 when a popular revolt swept corazon 
aquino into the presidency she has refused marcos many requests 
for permission to return home

soviet citizens looking for books at the 
moscow library where lenin dostoyevsky and chekhov once studied 
will soon be using computers programmed at a virginia university 
virginia tech library systems president vinod chachra sees it as 
more than a technical challenge to computerize the card catologue of 
the massive lenin library the project will encourage the soviet 
policy of openness or glasnost and help further business relations 
between the superpowers he says 
this is really opening up access to information chachra 
said in one sense this is bringing in more equality with the 
technology by automating the system it greatly increases the 
access to all people 
chachras company which is controlled by a nonprofit arm of 
virginia tech announced last month that the soviets had chosen its 
software system to automate their national library chachra will 
meet with the librarys director nikolai semyonovich kartashov in 
blacksburg on july 18 to discuss the start of the project in 
november 
the work is expected to take up to four years and cost 1 
million he said 
the lenin library located just off red square has 35 million 
books in 247 languages and 3000 employees its 18 reading rooms 
many of them with ornate high ceilings and lit by chandeliers seat 
more than 2300 people and are visited by more than 7000 readers 
each day 
in comparison the library of congress in washington has 26 
million books and the new york public library has 6 million books 
chachra said 
the library was founded in 1862 as the rumiantsev library named 
after a count whose collection accounted for most of its original 
holdings it was renamed in 1925 after the father of the russian 
revolution 
in addition to lenin famous russians who have studied in the 
library include authors leo tolstoy fyodor dostoyevsky and anton 
chekhov 
chachra visited the library during a recent fiveday trip to 
moscow 
i was struck by the number of people waiting outside the door 
for the library to open he said there arent that many 
libraries in the soviet union the users are dedicated 
they have to be checking out a book is a lengthy and frustrating 
process and just finding the right card catalog file is an ordeal 
because there are separate catalogs for various subcollections 
chachra said 
after finding the right catalogue the user must write the title 
and author on a slip of paper and stand in line for up to an hour to 
give the note to a circulation clerk the clerk sends the note to 
the book retrieval area via pneumatic tubes 
it can take anywhere from a half a day to five days to get a 
book chachra said occasionally the book has been lent to 
someone else and after waiting that long you find out you cant get 
it anyway 
under the planned automated system people looking for a book 
will step up to a usmade computer running on software designed by 
chachra and his staff for many it will be their first experience 
with a personal computer chachra said 
users will be able to make a book request directly from a 
terminal and find out right away whether the book is checked out 
chachra said 
the current system restricts access to information because of its 
cumbersome nature chachra said but that will change 
by the nature of the technology it will be in favor of the 
user he said the software is designed for open access 
chachra said it remains to be seen whether soviet officials will 
give access to some books that are now off limits to users 
presumably for political reasons 
the lenin library will be the first soviet library to 
computerize but it will be the sixth national library to automate 
with software from virginia tech library systems the company has 
computerized the national gallery of art library and the national 
agricultural library in the united states as well as libraries in 
scotland malaysia and finland 
the company has computerized nearly 100 other libraries 
including that of the us supreme court

condition he not be identified by name 
pap officers with pistols normally stand guard at foreign 
embassies it was not immediately clear why these guards were 
rearmed

a leading chinese dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi who has 
taken refuge at the us mission 
elsewhere hundreds of cheerful tourists gathered on the rostrum 
above the gate of heavenly peace where mao tsetung declared the

the government says about 300 people were killed half of them 
soldiers chinese witnesses and western diplomats say the deaths 
were in the thousands 
foreign tourists today paid 30 yuan 810 while chinese paid 
270 two days wages for many workers to stand atop the gate 
visitors from liaoning sichuan shandong and hubei provinces 
snapped away with their cameras most said they had not heard of the 
deaths during the military crackdown 
some crowded to get an autograph of wang fuyi one of the martial 
law commanders who brought troops to quell what the chinese 
government has called a counterrevolutionary rebellion last 
month others jostled each other to seek an autograph of zhang 
baifa vice mayor of beijing

the ruling institutional revolutionary 
party and its leftist opposition face an unusual test sunday 
whether the michoacan state legislative elections will be clean 
the preelection rhetoric has been harsh as both sides have 
poured money and energy into the race in this western mexico farming 
state 
the governing party known by its spanish initials pri has been 
in power in mexico for 60 years and has often been accused of 
winning elections through fraud 
the leftist democratic revolutionary party founded earlier this 
year by native son cuauhtemoc cardenas has been saying sundays 
balloting will likely be rife with votetampering 
the pri and fraud are synonymous democratic revolutionary 
sen roberto robles garnica told a news conference friday 
the state electoral commission controlled by pri has called out 
the army to guard the polls robles and other democratic 
revolutionary leaders said the move is an attempt to intimidate 
voters by fabricating a specter of violence 
however top pri officials say there may indeed be violence and 
call the troop deployment a preventive measure this isnt a 
ghost its reality one of them jorge medina viedas said in an 
interview 
in addition legislative elections will be held sunday in 
zacatecas chihuahua campeche and baja california state which 
will also elect a governor and mayors fair balloting is also at 
issue in the other states 
much attention has focused on michoacan which is seen as a key 
contest 
in the last election in 1986 the pri won 18 of 24 seats in 
michoacans singlehouse legislature and four small opposition 
parties took the rest 
but in july last year cardenas polled 64 percent of michoacans 
vote in the presidential election and his coalitions candidates 
took both senate seats and 12 of the states 13 national chamber of 
deputies from the pri 
although cardenas came in second behind president carlos salinas 
de gortari nationwide it was a stunning blow for the pri in the 
state 
in addition cardenas supporters mounted sitins last december at 
about half the states 113 city and town halls to demand the ouster 
of gov luis martinez villacana they accused him of corruption 
the protests prompted him to quit and take a job as director of 
the federal toll highways and bridges administration several pri 
mayors also resigned 
the new governor genovevo figuero zamudio issued a statement 
friday promising honest free clean and safe elections he said 
the party had overhauled its leadership and image 
as part of that new image the pri for the first time put forward 
candidates in open convention however they were then nominated by 
party leaders behind closed doors 
despite pris efforts opposition representatives are still 
complaining of purported irregularities in voter registration rolls 
and screening of poll watchers 
the conservative national action party weaker in this state is 
also fielding candidates 
about 15 million voters are expected to cast ballots at 2330 
polling stations in this state from 9 am to 6 pm sunday 
official results are expected a week later

federal investigators are probing 
allegations that a development agency used federal housing funds to 
finance campaigns of local democratic officials a newspaper 
reported 
at least five federal investigators thursday night searched the 
home of bernard c madrack chief operating officer of the greater 
camden development corp and seized 34 boxes of records the 
philadelphia inquirer reported in todays editions 
the nowdisbanded corporation was a nonprofit agency that 
processed federal housing money from 1983 to 1986 
hours after subpoenas were issued friday in the probe rep james 
florio the democratic gubernatorial nominee called for a speedy 
investigation and suggested republicans initiated the inquiry for 
political purposes 
camden county is florios political base and the agency under 
investigation was run by democratic leaders with ties to florio 
madrack spent seven years on florios staff 
county freeholder michael j dipiero a republican prompted the 
investigation by writing hud inspector general paul adams and 
alleging widespread abuse of hud funds and criminal activity at the 
agency the inquirer reported 
investigators said florio was not a target of the investigation 
and there was no evidence of his personal involvement the new york 
times reported in todays editions the investigators said florios 
political organization in camden county and a number of his 
associates are under scrutiny the newspaper said 
us attorney samuel a alito said his office is probing various 
hud matters in new jersey but would not comment 
florio said he received a telephone call friday evening from 
alito confirming the camden probe but said there were no individual 
targets 
the investigation comes as a congressional panel is looking into 
possible influence peddling and misuse of funds at the department of 
housing and urban development by prominent republicans during the 
reagan administration 
dipiero and michael leonard a former employee of the development 
agency told investigators at least 30000 in federal money may 
have been diverted to democratic campaigns the inquirer reported 
citing unidentified officials familiar with the probe 
dipiero also told investigators some hud money was used by agency 
employees to buy cocaine the inquirer reported 
the times said investigators were probing allegations that money 
was diverted to democratic campaigns and used for personal reasons 
including vacations 
madracks attorney charles n riley said his client was told he 
is not a target of the investigation the documents were in his home 
because he is their legal custodian he said 
florio noted the disclosure of the camden investigation followed 
by days the resignations of two top advisers to the republican 
nominee for governor rep jim courter because of their ties to the 
hud scandal 
the two events are so coincidental that i cannot help but 
wonder if there are political motivations involved in the leaks 
florio said he demanded federal officials determine how news of the 
investigation was leaked 
political strategist roger stone stepped down from the courter 
campaign earlier this week after a partner in his firm black 
manafort stone and kelly acknowledged the firm received more than 
300000 to obtain nearly 31 million in hud funds for a seabrook 
housing project that was opposed by local officials 
media analyst greg stevens who also resigned has said he made a 
telephone call to connect stones firm with state housing officials 
courter spokesman gordon hensley said the campaign was not 
involved in starting the camden investigation

inconveniences to plague the passengers from the moment they began 
their trip two weeks ago

they waited 16 hours to board in honolulu on the return flight

the humble mussel a tidal water 
delicacy is now playing a pivotal role in monitoring pollution in 
the north sea 
spread over 15 locations along the dutch coast 1500 of the 
jetblack mollusks were put into service this week as a way 
scientists can check the flow of poisonous waste through the north 
sea one of the most heavily polluted basins in the world a project 
spokesman said friday 
in filtering algae from sea water for food the bivalves also 
store poisonous waste and heavy metals a look at what they have 
stored gives a picture of the quality of water they live in 
they give us a perfect overview of the water quality over the 
time span involved said martin scholten a spokesman for the 
government project 
the mussels live in plastic baskets attached to shipping buoys up 
to six miles off the coast they will be checked in three sixweek 
periods over a year at a cost of 113600 
mussels are ideal for this kind of job because they filter so 
much water scholten said the average mussel processes about 13 
gallons of sea water a day he said

a jailed puerto rican nationalist has filed a 
petition for freedom under a supreme court decision he claims 
condones his burning of an american flag two years ago 
in what may be the first direct result of last weeks court 
decision carlos mendozalugo an inmate at the us penitentiary in 
atlanta filed a petition in federal court friday demanding the 
government show cause for keeping him in prison 
mendozalugo burned a flag in front of a us post office in 
puerto rico in 1987 as a protest for puerto rican independence 
it wasnt an act of vandalism i was protesting said 
mendozalugo 36 its unconstitutional for me to be in jail when 
i was making use of my freedom of speech 
a lawyer in the supreme court case said mendozalugo was the 
first jailed flagburner to seek freedom since the high court issued 
the june 21 decision 
this guy should not be in jail any longer if thats flag 
burning the basis for his conviction said lawyer david cole who 
represented flagburner gregory johnson in the texas vs johnson 
case 
the supreme court ruled in favor of johnson saying the 
constitutions guarantee of free speech protects people who burn the 
flag as a form of political protest 
in response to the ruling president bush this week began 
pressing for a constitutional amendment prohibiting desecration of 
the american flag 
the number of people in jail for flagburning is so small that 
the federal bureau of prisons doesnt keep statistics on it 
mendozalugo pleaded guilty to flag desecration and began serving 
a maximum oneyear sentence last december a staff member for the 
puerto rican magistrate handling the case said mendozalugos 
sentence was shortened recently to seven months making him eligible 
for release this month

police arrested more than 200 people on drug 
weapons and other charges in the years first sweep of ganginfested 
areas and they promised to keep up the pressure over the holiday 
weekend 
the latest dragnet is to let the gang members know they are not 
going to control the streets said police lt jim tatreau who 
organized the eighthour sweep that ended early today 
some 235 people 136 of them reputed gang members were arrested 
during the sweep of the citys south side said teri dixon a police 
analyst who recorded the arrests the number far exceeded the 150 
that tatreau had projected 
we expect tomorrow night to be even a little busier ms 
dixon said well see 
fortynine arrests were for felony narcotics violations and two 
were for misdemeanor narcotics violations 
other arrests involved such things as weapons charges 
outstanding felony warrants and driving under the influence ms 
dixon said 
portable booking trailers were set up at the police departments 
southeast division station in the heart of the impoverished watts 
district the site of deadly riots in 1965 
the effort represented the first massive dragnet aimed at 
drugdealing street thugs since last summers highly publicized 
hammer sweeps which also targeted the citys drug and 
ganginfested south side 
the sweeps will resume again this evening and continue through 
the holiday weekend with police shifting their focus west toward 
beach communities as the weekend progresses officials said 
nice people will be going to the beach were trying to keep 
the dirt bags away said detective tony celli 
despite last years sweeps the number of gangrelated slayings 
increased to 452 in los angeles county last year from 387 in 1987

the tanker that spilled 420000 gallons 
of heating oil into narragansett bay was released for repairs and 
the ships greek captain was freed on 50000 bail 
earlier friday a helmsman aboard the tanker told a federal 
inquiry board he saw a warning buoy on the wrong side of the ship 
before it ran aground but he didnt warn the captain 
the ships chief mate praised the captain as one of the best to 
work for and apologized for the spill which scientists said caused 
less environmental damage than first feared 
meanwhile officials in new jersey prepared to lift a state of 
emergency on the oilsoiled delaware river where a tanker spilled 
an estimated 300000 gallons of heating oil after running aground 
last weekend 
in providence federal magistrate jacob hagopian late friday 
released the world prodigy hagopian said his order would contain a 
provision that the ship be towed 
lt paul wolf said the coast guard expected to release the ship 
today to new york shipyard which runs a yard in new york city 
divers discovered the ship had a gash on either side extending as 
long as 200 feet down the 560foot vessel 
the magistrate also freed captain iakovos georgudis 43 after 
the ships owners wired 50000 bail georgudis had been confined 
aboard the ship and faces two misdemeanor charges he violated 
pollution laws 
helmsman konstadinos a paraskevopulos speaking through an 
interpreter said he saw the red buoy marking the reef a little to 
the left as the tanker headed into the harbor 
warning buoys should be kept on the right for ships entering a 
harbor but paraskevopulos said nothing about warning the captain 
given the discipline on board the ship the helmsman wouldnt 
dare make any suggestion to the master coast guard capt david h 
whitten said 
human error was a pretty good conclusion said whitten who 
ran the board of inquiry with two national transportation safety 
board investigators 
whitten said it would be six months before he finished a final 
report and ntsb investigators said theirs could take as long as 
nine months whitten said the biggest gap was lack of testimony from 
the captain 
testimony at the hearing showed that harbor pilots often board 
ships well past the point where state law requires them to board 
the chief mate georgios vlahos showed investigators a symbol on 
a british chart that corresponded to a pickup point for harbor 
pilots that was inside the line set by the state the world prodigy 
was well inside that line and had no pilot on board when it grounded 
vlahos also apologized for the accident 
i am very sorry for this happening i dont know what else to 
say i think it was a very bad time and all else is in your hands 
he told the board 
paraskevopulos said the captain was tied up with radio traffic to 
the harbor pilot just before the grounding 
the two men testified under federal immunity vlahos also 
testified before a grand jury investigating possible violations of 
the states harbor pilot and pollution laws 
state federal and university of rhode island scientists said 
there apparently had been little permanent environmental damage 
about 150 young lobsters 500 crabs 15 birds and numerous mussels 
have died they said but most small animals critical to the food 
chain such as zooplankton survived 
in new jersey the tanker presidente rivera leaked up to 1500 
barrels more oil while being cleaned and emptied but officials said 
most of the oil was mopped up with a boom and a skimmer 
officials anticipated lifting the emergency status from the 
delaware river over the weekend

a seaside long island village is scrapping plans 
to build a swimming pool and will return 1 million to the us 
department of housing and urban development that had granted for the 
project a newspaper reported today 
officials in island park requested earlier this week that their 
application for the pool be withdrawn citing local opposition to 
the project and rising costs the new york times reported 
the officials denied the cancellation was a response to a federal 
inquiry into hudsponsored projects on long island the newspaper 
said 
island park was awarded the funds for the pool last year after 
sen alfonse m damato a village resident personally lobbied 
thenhud secretary samuel r pierce 
the funds came from pierces discretionary fund in a letter to 
village residents last fall damato praised pierces wise 
decision to approve this grant 
an assistant to hud secretary jack kemp said kemp was pleased the 
pool project was dead 
we think the funds can be used for a purpose that will be more 
in line with assisting lowincome individuals said mary brunette 
the times reported that telephone calls to damatos office 
friday afternoon were not answered 
federal investigators are looking into allegations that 
hudsponsored houses went to politically connected residents in 
island park instead of minorities as had been planned

the posttraumatic stress defense used by 
some wives accused of killing their husbands also can apply to 
juveniles a judge ruled in finding a teenage girl innocent of 
killing her abusive father 
attorneys agreed the case set a legal precedent but 15yearold 
diana goodykoontz said she was surprised a judge rejected the 
prosecutions claim that she committed murder because she was 
influenced by heavymetal rock n roll music 
i thought they were going to do something to me anyway cause 
i like the music said ms goodykoontz its not fair to 
judge somebody just because of what they listen to 
circuit judge john kuder on friday ruled that the teenager acted 
in self defense when she shot her father navy chief petty officer 
dennis goodykoontz in the familys pensacola home 
the judge said ms goodykoontz suffered from batteredchild 
syndrome similar to the disorder that afflicts battleshocked 
veterans and wives who have been abused by their husbands she had a 
reasonable belief she was in danger although her father took no 
overt physical action just before he was shot with his own handgun 
kuder said 
im unaware of any decision by a judge thats set this 
precedent in florida said assistant public defender elton killam 
who represented ms goodykoontz 
his cocounsel paul mones of los angeles who is writing a book 
about abused children slaying their parents said he knew of no 
other similar decision by a juvenile court in a nonjury trial but 
he said juvenile court decisions arent always publicized 
kuder also said the state failed to prove any connection between 
heavymetal music and the july 23 shooting he took nearly two 
months to review the case 
during a fourday nonjury trial that ended may 4 ms 
goodykoontz testified her father had made sexual overtures and she 
was afraid he was going to rape her the judge also heard testimony 
that the father had a history of violence against his wife and three 
children including a threat to kill the entire family on the day he 
died

up a day in which he announced his proposed language for a 
constitutional amendment against desecration of the american flag 
spoke at a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the civil rights 
act and met with south african antiapartheid activist albertina 
sisulu 
bush will remain in kennebunkport until early wednesday he has 
no public events scheduled but plans to view the fourth of july 
fireworks display 
bush will be back at the white house for only a few days next 
week before leaving for poland on july 9 visiting eastern europe as 
a prelude to the economic summit of major western industrialized 
nations in paris 
in an independence day message to the nation released by the 
white house friday bush asked all americans to remember the 
precious legacy of liberty we enjoy 
kennebunkport was bustling with vacationers as the president 
arrived most of them strolling around the main town square where 
boutiques and curio shops abound a fairly steady stream of cars 
drove slowly past the secret service checkpoints on the narrow 
coastal road that passes bushs home 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the traveling white house 
was prepared to comment on the supreme courts scheduled decision 
monday on a landmark abortion case 
bush began the independence day weekend with a flagdraped event 
friday at the iwo jima memorial of marines raising the flag during 
world war ii where the president pushed for a constitutional 
amendment to allow laws against burning the us flag the supreme 
court ruled june 21 that the constitutions freedomofspeech 
guarantees protect people who burn the flag as a form of political 
protest 
the amendment crafted by the white house and republican 
congressional leaders reads the congress and the states shall 
have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the 
united states 
critics have said such an amendment would open the door for 
erosion of the first amendment to the constitution 
but bush said this amendment preserves the widest conceivable 
range of options for free expression

a us navy intelligence analyst who killed himself 
after defecting to the soviet union had missed his homeland and was 
irritated by moscows chronic shortages of consumer goods pravda 
said today 
but glenn michael souther still asked to be buried in his kgb 
officers uniform the communist party daily said 
the newspaper described the 32yearold souther who committed 
suicide in moscow on june 22 as a top soviet spy it said he had 
access to the most valuable documents on the topsecret plans for 
use of the us navy in a nuclear war against the soviet union and 
other socialist countries 
he belonged with such outstanding soldiers of the invisible 
front as kim philby and george blake pravda said naming two 
famous british intelligence service operatives who spied for the 
soviets 
the article did not say how souther died but it said colleagues 
had noticed his occasional bouts of depression but never thought it 
could lead to suicide 
the kgb chief gen vladimir kryuchko said on wednesday that 
souther committed suicide 
souther defected in 1986 when the fbi began investigating him at 
the time the hammond ind native was working as a satellite photo 
analyst in the navys 2nd fleet headquarters in norfolk va 
pravda indicated souther fled his native land with pain in his 
heart only because he feared the fbi investigation 
of course not everything glenn met in the soviet land was as 
he had expected the newspaper said for example he could never 
comprehend that it is possible to drop into a store and be unable to 
find some needed item 
the article also quoted a letter souther left to his colleagues 
at the kgb where he was given the rank of major last year 
justice demands that you hear my last words i do not regret 
our relationship it was a longstanding one and helped me grow as a 
person i wish to be buried in the uniform of an officer of the 
kgb 
the article did not say whether authorities complied with that 
request but kryuchkov said that souther was given a military 
funeral on monday and he was buried in the same section of kuntsevo 
cemetary as philby 
pravda said he took the name mikhail orlov after his arrival in 
the soviet union choosing the russian word for eagles for his 
last name because it symbolized freedom and strength

which called for reintegration of rebels into angolan society 
the rebel leader has agreed to sit out of angolan politics for 
two years before running in free elections against dos santos

socialist asae uemura a divorced mother of two 
trying to beat male incumbents and the party that has ruled japan 
for decades seems to have everything going for her politically 
until recently a candidate like ms uemura would not have 
generated much optimism but a series of scandals and an unpopular 
new tax have played into the hands of opposition officeseekers 
public opinion polls paint a dismal picture for the governing 
liberal democratic party in an election sunday for the 128 tokyo 
municipal assembly seats 
with 9 million eligible voters tokyo is being watched closely as 
an indicator of what could lie ahead for the liberal democrats 
japans governing party since it was formed in 1954 nationwide 
elections for half the upper house of parliament are scheduled july 
23 
only 25 percent of tokyo voters polled by the asahi shimbun 
newspaper said they plan to support liberal democratic candidates 
down from 34 percent who expressed support before the last such 
elections were held in 1985 
a kyodo news service poll released thursday showed 16 percent 
supporting the socialists the top national opposition party while 
support for the liberal democrats had fallen from 424 to only 132 
percent 
the increased chances for women may come from voters anger over 
a sex scandal involving prime minister sousuke uno who allegedly 
has kept several paid mistresses 
requests for uno to give speeches for the partys municipal 
candidates have dropped off at one rally he attended governing 
party supporters scuffled with women carrying placards that said 
we dont need a prostitution premier 
senior party officials are considering replacing uno after the 
tokyo polling if the liberal democrats lose badly because a loss in 
the upper house election then will be obvious due to unos 
womanizing scandal the mainichi newspaper said 
the uno cabinet now seems virtually dead it said in an 
editorial 
campaigning a few days before the election ms uemura rode 
through the streets of minato ward in a van waving and asking 
passersby for support 
like all candidates ms uemura wore white gloves and a large 
carnation in her lapel she said she spends 12 hours campaigning 
each day 
the ant has brought down the elephant ms uemura said 
referring to the upset victory of a female socialist in a 
parliamentary byelection on sunday in a traditionally conservative 
area in northern japan 
in the back of the van two attractive young women what 
japanese campaign managers call warbler girls waved and 
smiled one of them yukari hibiya said she was motivated by the 
177aday pay not strong political convictions 
but i wouldnt have accepted this kind of work from the ldp 
since theyre behind the tax she said 
the liberal democrats forced a 3 percent sales tax through 
parliament in december despite an opposition boycott the sales tax 
part of a controversial tax change took effect april 1 
alarmed by the losses at the polls and reeling from the recruit 
influencebuying scandal that brought down unos predecessor noboru 
takeshita the liberal democrats has pledged to clean up its image 
as head of the party id like to devote myself entirely to the 
party and political reforms uno said after he became prime 
minister june 2 
uno was chosen to head the party because he is one of the few 
senior liberal democrats untainted by recruit a publishing 
conglomerate accused of doling out millions of dollars in political 
donations and underpriced stocks in exchange for favors 
among the reforms announced by the liberal democrats are 
dissolution of party factions which create power blocs but force 
leaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers 
political activities nearly all liberal democratic lawmakers belong 
to one of six factions 
critics say the governing party is not serious about change 
their plans are full of loopholes said satsuki eda leader 
of the social democratic federation the fifthlargest bloc in 
parliament 
eda said selfrestraint is needed not legislation 
they dont need to spend so much money eda said i dont 
spend so much but i survive elections

a man who watched a coworker leap out a 
sixthfloor window as smoke filled a burning office building said he 
almost followed her but kept his poise and helped four others 
escape by ladder 
michael blackman smashed open a window to allow the group to 
breathe while they waited for rescue but one of them panicked and 
jumped and was in critical condition early today four other people 
were killed 
i wasnt calm i was scared to death i think i said were 
going to die blackman said 
the blaze friday at the 10story peachtree 25th building also 
left more than 20 people hospitalized including five firefighters 
officials said rescuers were hampered by panicking office workers 
my understanding is that some firefighters could have saved or 
helped more people if they didnt panic but some people did 
panic said sandra walker a spokeswoman for mayor andrew young 
the woman who jumped from the window identified as cassandra 
hayward 20 broke both legs and an ankle and underwent surgery 
friday night at piedmont hospital a spokesman said 
authorities said the fire started about 1030 am with an 
explosion at an electrical panel on the sixth floor of the 
darktinted glass building where workers were repairing a fuse 
authorities said they did not know what caused the explosion and 
fire which later spread two floors below and one above 
its simple speculation but it may have been a short said 
acting fire chief tom perrin 
the blast killed a maintenance worker who was thrown several 
feet and melted aluminum near the panel perrin said 
names of the maintenance worker and the other three dead one of 
whom was a woman were not released by authorities but the family 
of graphics artist clifton chandler 29 confirmed that he was one 
of those killed 
sgt steve martin of the fulton county medical examiners office 
said this morning that reports of a fifth death stemmed from an 
error in his office another unrelated death occurred about the 
time of the fire and for a time was mistakenly included in the fire 
toll he said 
blackman 30 said he heard a series of loud pops from an 
electrical panel outside the door of his office suite 
it hit me real quick that we were in real bad trouble 
blackman said it went from oh my god something really bad has 
happened to the guy working on the fuse box to oh my god 
something bad is happening to all of us 
i went running out there the maintenance guy was out there 
screaming for help blackman said we couldnt get to him 
blackman and five other workers from the private bureau of 
wholesale sales representatives including hayward fled back into 
his office where smoke began making it difficult to breathe 
blackman threw a chair through a window and a few minutes later 
hayward jumped 
she went right by me blackman said 
blackman who was hospitalized in good condition with smoke 
inhalation and cuts said he led the other workers one by one to the 
5footwide window for breaths of air until firefighters could reach 
the window with a ladder then blackman helped the others out 
it probably wasnt more than five or 10 minutes it seemed like 
about 30 years blackman said in a telephone interview from the 
hospital 
perrin said the fire was severe because the building has no 
sprinkler system it was built in 1962 before sprinklers were 
required 
about 200 people many of them rescued office workers with 
sootblackened clothing and skin gathered on the street outside the 
building as firefighters battled the blaze some sat down breathing 
from oxygen masks 
darlene dunn 57 said she was one of eight people in a 
sixthfloor office when the fire began she said she acted mainly on 
instinct before being rescued by the firefighters ladder she used 
her chair to break glass 
i busted out a couple of windows so we could breathe fresh 
air ms dunn said after being treated for smoke inhalation we 
tried to get out of the building but there was no way we were 
trapped 
harry komsky vice president of american management co of los 
angeles which manages the building said the cause of the fire will 
be investigated

a communistled coalition cast its support 
today with a conservative party to form an interim government and 
end a twoweek political standoff 
the historical alliance between the conservative new democracy 
party and the coalition of left and progress comes 40 years after 
the communists were defeated in a civil war by usbacked 
government forces 
leftist coalition head harilaos florakis emerged from a meeting 
today with new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis to announce 
he would support an interim government led by new democracy 
parliamentarian tzanis tzannetakis 
mitsotakis and florakis conferred with president christos 
sartzetakis to detail the agreement that allows their coalition to 
have a majority in the 300member parliament and end eight years of 
government by the panhellenic socialist movement of premier andreas 
papandreou 
besieged by a supportive crowd as he left the presidential 
palace mitsotakis said the negotiations had ended positively and 
that he had agreed on tzannetakis as premier designate 
the presidents office announced later that tzannetakis would be 
sworn in on sunday 
tzannetakis 62 is popular among his colleagues in parliament 
and known for his fervent belief in democratic institutions 
papandreou tainted by financial scandals and a highly publicized 
relationship with a woman while he was married had been asked by 
sartzetakis to remain as caretaker premier until the crisis was 
resolved 
parliament is scheduled to convene monday and elect a house 
speaker the next day the new government goes before parliament in 
two weeks to seek a vote of confidence 
mitsotakis and florakis agreed that the coalition would have a 
threemonth life span and that its work would be limited to 
restoring democratic institutions and cleaning up greek politics 
florakis said that at the end of the three months we will 
reexamine our position and act accordingly 
however one of the two parties could pull out of the coalition 
because of wide differences in political ideology if that happens 
the president would then appoint another caretaker regime consisting 
of nonparliamentarians to lead the country to national elections 
the new coalition accord followed five days of meetings between 
leaders of the two groups 
the conservativeleftist coalition would resolve the political 
crisis that followed general elections on june 18 
new democracy won 145 seats six short of a majority it thus 
needed to find a partner if it was to govern 
the coalition of the left and progress captured 28 seats while 
the larger panhellenic socialist movement took 125 seats 
two seats in this months elections were also won by the small 
conservative democratic renewal party and an independent 
todays agreement came after attempts by leaders of all three 
major parties failed to form a coalition government 
the new parliament is to form a 12member committee to 
investigate allegations that papandreou and at least 20 other former 
ministers from his party and officials were involved in 
multimilliondollar financial scandals papandreou has denied any 
wrongdoing 
the conservativeleftist alliance is considered a major blow to 
the socialists who called on the communists to cooperate in a 
government of progressive forces but florakis turned them down 
saying he would not join forces with a scandalridden group 
the coalition talks were the first time in the history of greece 
a nation of 10 million that the communists had been given the 
opportunity to help form a government

solidaritybacked lawmakers met today to 
decide who to back for president a powerful new post that communist 
party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski says he does not want 
solidarity has opposed a candidacy by jaruzelski who said on 
friday that he did not want to run because he was too closely linked 
to the 1981 martiallaw crackdown that crushed the labor union and 
forced it underground 
jaruzelski recommended interior minister czeslaw kiszczak for the 
office which is similar to the presidency created in the soviet 
union for mikhail s gorbachev 
solidarity leader lech walesa said today he believed czeslaw 
kiszczak had a better chance of winning the post than jaruzelski 
the president is to be elected next week by a simple majority of 
the national assembly authorities want to have the new president 
seated before president bushs scheduled threeday visit begins july 
9 
whether its jaruzelski or kiszczak is an internal problem of 
the government coalition it seems in this concrete situation that 
gen kiszczak has a better chance walesa told reporters before 
the meeting of prosolidarity lawmakers 
the general is paying now for everything bad that took place in 
poland guilty or not guilty let historians think about it 
thats how it is 
kiszczak helped negotiate the historic accord between the 
communistrun government and the solidarityled opposition that 
resulted in the legalization of the trade union opposition 
participation in elections and broad changes in the structure of the 
government 
the 259member solidarity delegation in the national assembly met 
behind closed doors a solidarity source inside the meeting 
lawmakers were discussing the possibility of finding a party or 
neutral candidate they could support the source said the 
legislators also debated nominating a solidarity candidate an idea 
the union so far has opposed 
at fridays meeting of the communist partys policymaking 
central committee officials neither accepted nor rejected 
jaruzelskis proposal that he not run for president 
but the committee did ask him to reconsider party spokesman jan 
bisztyga said party representatives to the national assembly did 
the same 
outside party headquarters about 500 young antijaruzelski 
demonstrators tried to march to the central committee meeting but 
riot police blocked them 
the youths hurled stones smoke bombs and firebombs at police 
who fired tear gas and bursts from a water cannon in encounters that 
lasted for hours the state news agency pap said 11 police were hurt 
and 14 demonstrators were detained 
jaruzelski 65 said he chose not to run because he was too 
closely associated with the crackdown on solidarity 
the key matter for poland now is national agreement 
when there is an obstacle to reconciliation and to the uniting of 
social forces there is only one possible solution even if that 
obstacle is wojciech jaruzelski he said in his statement later 
carried by state media 
endorsing kiszczak sitting a few seats away jaruzelski called 
him a soldier a politician a patriot and a man who has been 
close to me for many years in the eyes of society including 
opposition circles he is rightly considered a leading 
representative of the line of reconciliation 
jaruzelski said nothing about leaving his powerful post as party 
chief 
also friday the government announced a onemonth wageandprice 
freeze halting major price increases until after the new parliament 
and government are seated 
bisztyga indicated that some legislators in the communistled 
coalition fear that jaruzelski lacks enough votes in the national 
assembly for a safe election the coalition nominally has a 300259 
majority over solidaritybacked legislators but its internal 
discipline is wobbly 
bisztyga said a final decision on a nominee will be made at a 
later party meeting after consultations with the two junior partners 
in the coalition the peasant and democratic parties 
if decisions of those groups show a safe election calculation 
then there is a possibility jaruzelski would be the nominee after 
all bisztyga said otherwise kiszczak would be considered 
a jaruzelski loyalist kiszczak 63 is an army general who heads 
polands extensive police apparatus and helped wage the governments 
war against solidarity for most of the 1980s 
but he won the confidence of solidaritys leaders during 
negotiations that began last aug 31 during a national wave of 
strikes 
in parliamentary elections june 4 and june 18 solidarity got 99 
of its candidates elected to the 100member senate and it won all 
the 161 seats available to the opposition in the 460member sejm

surrounding mountains pounded the 310squaremile christianheld 
region northeast of the capital with 130mm howitzers and 107mm

identified said his gunners scored several direct hits on the 
syrian artillery emplacements in west beirut

syrian army ambulance rushing to a seaside syrian howitzer 
emplacement in west beirut shortly before dawn 
seconds later the ambulance sped out of the emplacement which 
is hidden behind sand ramparts i dont know what happened there 
one witness said 
the thud of exploding shells and the whistling of rockets echoed 
across beirut and its surroundings 
the intensity of the barrage sharply decreased around 8 am 
allowing people to leave underground shelters

which came a few hours before a scheduled meeting in the saudi town 
of jeddah by three arab foreign ministers to consider a mechanism 
for stabilizing lebanon 
a fullfledged arab summit in may urged a settlement to lebanons 
14yearold civil war by november 
the confrontation broke out two days after aoun blockaded illegal 
ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut to salvage about 
100 million in lost customs dues annually 
the syrians and their allies retaliated by besieging the 
christian enclave home for 1 million people

industries with the highest stakes in clean air 
legislation are lobbying to make sure stringent enforcement 
provisions arent slipped into the formal bill submitted to congress 
by the bush administration 
industry lobbyists say they believe some environmental protection 
agency officials want to be tougher on industry than does president 
bush who unveiled his clean air plan june 12 
lobbyists for the auto electric utility and petroleum industries 
say they are particularly concerned about tougher standards on acid 
rain additional curbs on motor vehicle pollution and the amount of 
flexibility that industry will be given to reduce pollutants 
the bill promises to be at the center of a major congressional 
struggle for at least the next six months 
were emphasizing the importance of sticking with the 
presidents program said dale brooks a chevron lobbyist who has 
participated in petroleum industry meetings with administration 
officials since bush outlined his plan 
if they start dragging in cats and dogs it will slow down 
the process considerably he said 
epa spokesman david cohen responded if the rumor is were 
going off in directions rejected by the administrations domestic 
policy council thats absolutely false were taking a very 
conservative approach to making the presidents idea work 
the industry lobbyists said their concern was inspired in part by 
an early epa draft of the legislation which contained measures 
industry didnt like but which preceded bushs announcement and is 
now everyone agrees outdated they added that administration 
officials listened but made no specific commitments on legislative 
language 
the industry executives pointed out that bush only revealed the 
broad outlines and goals of his plan while leaving the legislative 
drafting where a word or numerical change can make an enormous 
difference to technical and policy experts 
our concern is the epa will try to make the bill more stringent 
than bush indicated said one lobbyist for a large utility who 
participated in one meeting and was familiar with several others 
i would say the effort is lowkey fairly targeted and fairly 
discreet 
the lobbyist who spoke only on condition his name not be used 
said utilities are concerned with the acid rain reduction plan 
because bush did not use precise language on the amount of sulfur 
dioxide emissions to be permitted by coalfired power plants 
bush said his proposal envisions an emission standard of 25 
pounds per million btus through 1995 that would be tightened to 
approximately 12 pounds per million btus through the year 2000 
those words give epa room to wiggle around in achieving the 
soughtafter 10 millionton sulfur dioxide reduction the lobbyist 
said noting that epa has in the past discussed an even tougher 
standard for the 19952000 phase 
the industry official added that at a meeting with epa officials 
we didnt accuse them of subverting what the president said but 
epa knew why were were inquiring about some of these things 
the auto industry which says the replacement of old cars with 
new ones will lower motor vehicle emissions is wary of new tailpipe 
standards the petroleum industry is concerned about how far bushs 
plan for alternative motor vehicle fuels will go 
other industry concerns are that epa might try to impose strong 
permit requirements that would be a bureaucratic nightmare 
insert strong federal authority over state and local governments and 
give the epa administrator wider powers 
there has been no comparable lobbying effort by environmental 
organizations said casey padgett director of environmental action 
trying to lobby epa would be trying to lobby our friends 
padgett said and we dont have the access to omb office of 
management and budget that industry does 
richard ayres head of the clean air coalition composed of major 
environmental groups said hes willing to wait for the fine 
print before launching any lobbying campaign 
one oil industry lobbyist said however he thinks bush will keep 
his proposal free from tampering 
this president is handson and hes going to want to see it 
and understand it said marc himmelstein of the american petroleum 
institute

some heavyhanded third world leaders are 
scorned by the united states for human rights abuses then theres 
zaires president mobutu sese seko who turned up here last week and 
received a red carpet welcome 
for the past generation mobutu has been a source of both pride 
and anguish to washington it is hard to find a leader anywhere more 
willing to support washingtons policies than mobutu but he is a 
leader who tolerates virtually no dissent while presiding over what 
is widely regarded as one of africas most corrupt societies 
mobutu himself has accumulated vast personal wealth taking the 
form of a number of castles and palaces in europe and elsewhere and 
huge foreign bank accounts some estimates of these accounts run 
into the billions but mobutu has put the figure at less than 50 
million 
randall robinson an africa expert and liberal critic of mobutu 
derides zaire as a kleptocracy 
successive administrations in washington dating back to mobutus 
rise to power in 1965 have been willing to overlook mobutus 
perceived shortcomings and focus instead on his unswerving 
willingness to support us strategic objectives 
at a time when so many third world countries regardless of 
political system have shied away from supporting washingtons 
foreign policy agenda mobutu is an exception 
he has allowed the us military use of zairean territory to 
resupply anticommunist guerrillas in angola he played a major role 
in bringing about a ceasefire in angolas civil war on june 22 a 
goal that had eluded the efforts of others for 14 years 
he has been an outspoken opponent of libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi his representatives have lobbied hard against antiamerican 
resolutions in the organization of african unity and other third 
world groups 
a month ago he helped the bush administration fend off a bid by 
the palestine liberation organization to join the world health 
organization when the united states decided to boycott the 1980 
olympics in moscow mobutu ordered zaires athletes to stay home as 
well 
but then there is mobutus authoritarian side which was 
described recently by freedom house a new yorkbased group which 
attempts to promote democracy throughout the world 
in zaire the report said presidential elections are farces 
private newspaper ownership remains only in name broadcasting is 
government owned and directed censorship and selfcensorship are 
pervasive there is no right of assembly and union organization is 
controlled government has been arbitrary and capricious the 
judiciary is not independent prisoners of conscience are numerous 
and execution and torture common 
in terms of human freedom the report ranked zaire at about the 
same level as vietnam which like zaire is a oneparty state 
corruption in zaire the study said is pervasive many of the 
same criticisms are contained in the annual state department human 
rights report 
none of the supposed drawbacks appears to have had much impact on 
us aid programs in zaire hundreds of millions of us aid dollars 
have been earmarked for zaire under mobutus rule the aid levels 
recently have been averaging a shade under 50 million making zaire 
one of the largest aid recipients in africa 
when president bush received mobutu on thursday he skirted the 
human rights issue concentrating instead in his public remarks on 
the zaireans diplomatic achievements and his staunch backing for 
american policies 
during his visit mobutu dismissed questions about human rights 
abuses contending that he has the support of 100 percent of 
zaires 34 million people and for all the sympathy he has received 
from washington over the years mobutu indicated in an appearance 
friday that his friendship has not always been reciprocated 
seemingly more in sorrow than in anger mobutu said the sudan 
received eight times more us aid than zaire several years ago 
despite staking out antius positions 
we have been a steadfast friend he said i find this a bit 
confusing

a judge declared a mistrial in a murder 
case after learning that the jury foreman had brought a dictionary 
into the deliberations so jurors could look up words the judge used 
in his instructions 
it was highly improper david n cooper attorney for 
defendant moses davison said friday they were sitting in the 
jury room using a dictionary to determine the guilt or innocence of 
my client 
under questioning by superior court judge dominic cresto robert 
forest a pawtucket teacher who was the jury foreman admitted he 
brought a dictionary with him thursday 
one of the words he said jurors looked up was malice defined 
by the random house dictionary of the english language as a desire 
to inflict injury or suffering on another especially when based on 
deepseated meanness 
the law however defines malice differently blacks law 
dictionary says malice is not necessarily personal hate or ill 
will but it is that state of mind which is reckless of the law and 
of the legal rights of the citizen 
cooper said that if the jurors wanted the judge to repeat the 
legal definition of malice all they had to do was ask 
the mistrial friday allows the prosecution to bring davison 39 
a construction worker from houston to trial again in the slaying of 
carl williams also a construction worker from texas

for burmese students who saw their own 
dreams of democracy crushed last year the suppression of 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing conjures up bitter memories 
several thousand protesters were killed in burma when the 
military put down a nationwide uprising demanding political reform 
and an end to a quarter century of economic mismanagement and 
authoritarian oneparty rule 
we feel for the chinese students because the same things have 
happened to us said aung myint who was a university student 
during the burma uprising it seems that there isnt much 
difference between the military in china and the military in burma 
unlike people power struggles in the philippines and 
elsewhere in asia force has largely succeeded at least for the 
time being in stifling popular cries for democracy in burma and 
china 
but nine months after burma put down its uprising the political 
climate remains uncertain elections have been promised in the 
spring of 1990 and oppostion parties have been permitted 
but the opposition groups complain of harrassment and continuing 
arrests and many doubt the military will be willing to transfer 
power in the future 
what we saw in both countries was a challenge to established 
authority in a form that they were not willing to countenance 
said michael leifer a southeast asia expert in london 
he said a common factor in both countries which seemed to lead 
to the bloody climaxes was an older generation of leaders 
controlling the events 
burma expert joseph silverstein notes differences between the top 
leaders of the two countries deng xiaoping was a whole lot 
smarter and burmas ne win a whole lot crueler the american 
academic said in an interview noting chinas economic progress and 
burmas stagnation 
although brig gen saw maung is nominally burmas head of state 
western diplomats say 78yearold strongman ne win retains power 
despite his official retirement last july 
in china no promise of political change has been indicated but 
both countries have pledged to pursue domestic economic reforms and 
open doors to foreign economic influence which in burmas case had 
been closed since the early 1960s 
the international community was outraged by both crackdowns and 
announced economic sanctions but within a few months the boycott of 
burma began to erode critics say the revival of trade ties mostly 
by asian countries has boosted the military government and works 
against the democratic movement 
if maintained international economic sanctions were likely to be 
more damaging to chinas more sophisticated economy leifer said 
years of socialist mismanagement took burma once one of 
southeast asias richest countries to the brink of economic 
collapse 
silverstein believes it was because of this that burmas uprising 
attracted great popular support 
he believes the burma revolution was on the verge of success 
until the military became worried about splits within its ranks 
only then did it move decisively to crush the demonstrators some 
differences were also reported within the chinese military but if 
they existed they were finally overridden 
in burma students like aung myint are last years heroes while 
chinese dissidents are feted in the west and allowed generous visa 
extensions burmese students complain they are largely ignored 
aung myint was among the estimated 7500 students who fled the 
repression he said he decided to go after witnessing the killing of 
five close friends and many others at the gates of mandalay 
univerity 
he now lives at manerplaw the jungle headquarters of the karen 
national union an ethnic rebel group fighting for greater autonomy 
several hundred burmese students are fighting alongside the rebels 
us congressmen last week voted 2 million in humanitarian aid 
to the exiled burmese many of whom suffer harsh jungle conditions 
and have contracted malaria the students say more could be done for 
them and against the rangoon government by the international 
community 
silverstein said the political climate in burma is more volatile 
than in china i dont think for a moment there has been any 
settling down the heavy hand of the military has squashed but not 
eliminated he said 
i think that while deng has found his man and the system 
will go forward ne win has still to find his man and his system

buzz aldrin laments that the 
promise of apollo was never fulfilled that the american space 
program languished after he and neil armstrong left the first human 
footprints on the moon two decades ago 
he says he hopes the 20th anniversary of apollo 11 will become 
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human 
expansion outward 
but given todays political and tight budgetary climate aldrin 
is not too hopeful 
president bush is expected to voice continuing support for a 
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about 
nasas program when he meets with aldrin armstrong and their 
command module pilot michael collins on july 20 the anniversary 
of the moon landing 
but no matter how many nice things the president says about 
space the political truth is that congress must approve the money 
and with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut 
congress is not expected to give much support to new projects 
so the national aeronautics and space administration once again 
is at a crossroads as it was when the glory days of apollo ended 
president john f kennedy had committed this nation to landing a 
man on the moon in the 1960s the goal was to gain space superiority 
over the soviet union whose early feats had earned the russians 
worldwide respect and shocked americans 
when the united states won the race to the moon nasa laid out 
bold plans for the future 
to a presidential panel agency head thomas paine in 1969 
proposed a 12man space station and a reusable space shuttle in 
operation as early as 1976 followed by a station in moon orbit a 
base on the moon a 50man space station in earth orbit and a manned 
mission to mars in the 1980s 
but in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and 
involvement in vietnam costly plans to explore space were given low 
priority 
only the reuseable space shuttle survived and its proposed 
funding was cut deeply 
those were tough times said paine who resigned in 
frustration a year after apollo 11 
the ford and carter administrations were lukewarm toward the 
space program but the shuttle was built it performed capably as a 
space truck for 24 missions until jan 28 1986 when the challenger 
exploded killing its seven crew members and grounding the program 
for 32 months 
nasa had gained some hope from president reagans endorsement of 
a strong space program and from his 1984 state of the union message 
in which he backed building the space station freedom 
in 1985 congress created a commission to define longterm space 
goals its chief was thomas paine the former nasa administrator 
six months after challenger paine stood in the oval office and 
gave reagan a slick leatherbound volume that recommended the space 
station a lunar base and manned trips to mars essentially an 
update of paines 1969 plan 
reagan two years later signed a presidential directive on 
national space policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental 
objective it endorsed the space station and without being 
specific set a longrange goal to expand human presence and 
activity beyond earth orbit into the solar system 
reagans policy set in motion a nasa program named pathfinder 
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic 
exploration of the moon and planets advanced missions in orbit and 
on planetary surfaces extended human presence in space and space 
transportation to the moon and planets 
bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a 
space station he established the national space council headed by 
vice president dan quayle to recommend a comprehensive space policy 
quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for bushs 
anniversary meeting with the apollo 11 astronauts 
nasa needs a decision from congress soon on how much money it can 
spend next year on space station freedom a permanent orbiting space 
station is essential to those ambitious pathfinder dreams and would 
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into 
space 
bush has requested 205 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to 
continue work on the station predictions are that congress will 
trim that by 400 million to 700 million amounts that space 
officials say could further delay or even kill the project 
the space station project has gone through five tumultuous years 
reagan wanted it built in cooperation with americas major allies 
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10 
european nations japan and canada agreed to invest nearly 8 
billion to build sections of it 
nasa said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the 
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the us cost at 8 
billion in 1987 agency officials revised the pricetag to 146 
billion the new figure covered a suddenly scaleddown phase one 
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment 
modules would be attached the struts would be added in orbit under 
phase two 
shortly after that a national research council panel reviewing 
station costs and technical issues for the white house said the 
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be 2502 
billion with phase two raising the cost to 328 billion 
the schedule began slipping and nasa now says if it receives the 
proper funding it could begin assembling the station in 1995 
some in congress believe nasa should alter its plans and build a 
less complex station and instead of relying totally on the space 
shuttle develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting 
job 
orbiting at 250 miles freedom would be home to a crew of eight 
with astronauts rotating back to earth after four to six months 
the station would allow humans to study the stars and planets 
from the pollutionfree environment of space the weightless 
interior would permit manufacture of new contaminationfree 
medicines and other products impossible to create on earth 
astronauts would assemble service and repair satellites and send 
them out into space and the station could eventually be the staging 
point for mans return to the moon or a journey to mars 
no one can predict whether these grand plans will come about but 
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary apollo 11 flight to 
the moon 20 years ago think they should 
a permanent presence in space is a worthy objective and i hope 
that space station freedom becomes a reality neil armstrong said 
recently 
i strongly endorse the station a scientific base on the moon 
and eventually manned flights to mars said buzz aldrin 
michael collins who orbited the moon while armstrong and aldrin 
walked its surface envisioned setting up a colony on mars 
were a nation of explorers he said we started on the 
east coast we went to the west coast and then vertically starting 
with the wright brothers chuck yeager through the sound barrier 
armstrong and aldrin on the moon 
its in our tradition its in our culture

pope john paul ii has decided to send a 
diplomatic envoy to warsaw clearing the way for full relations 
between the vatican and the popes native poland according to a 
papal letter released saturday 
poland would be the first warsaw pact country to have full 
diplomatic ties with the holy see relations were cut by the 
communists who took power in poland in 1945 
in a letter to cardinal josef glemp the nations roman catholic 
leader the pope said he was ready to send a representative to 
warsaw 
the apostolic see wishes that the decision that it now takes 
can constitute the full continuation of diplomatic relations with 
poland the pope wrote 
a senior church official in rome speaking on condition of 
anomymity said the popes decision means that full diplomatic 
relations are imminent and its not going to be a matter of 
months 
the popes letter was dated april 11 the church official said 
the vatican chose to release it now so as not to link the diplomatic 
issue with the expected selection of a polish president later this 
week 
john paul said the polish government has been seeking 
normalization of relations with the vatican through the exchange of 
envoys and that polands bishops approved of the idea 
at the current state of affairs it seems possible and even 
opportune that the holy see send to warsaw a representative with 
appropriate characteristics the letter said 
the letter did not say who the vatican envoy would be or what 
diplomatic title he would hold 
the pope said the envoys presence in warsaw was also important 
because polish churchmen vatican representatives and government 
officials have been preparing a vaticanstate accord known as a 
convention that has been considered a condition for establishment 
of diplomatic ties 
in this phase of preparations the holy see would be ready to 
send its representative to poland even before the signing of the 
convention the letter said this is so the fulltime

two flight attendants were injured during a severe 
thunderstorm after an american airlines jetliner was denied 
permission by cuban air traffic controllers to change course 
officials said 
state department spokesman adam shub said officials were 
considering filing a formal protest with the cuban government he 
said the incident thursday night involving flight 1089 from miami to 
kingston jamaica apparently stemmed from cubas recently announced 
warning that it would shoot down unauthorized aircraft as part of 
its antidrug push 
we have urged the cuban government to exercise restraint in 
implementing its announced policy of shooting down unauthorized 
aircraft that do not land for inspection shub said while we 
welcome the increased efforts to interdict narcotics trafficking 
the loss of innocent life must be avoided 
about 930 pm thursday the pilot radioed havana air traffic 
controllers asking if the plane could steer away from the sudden 
storm in a 17milewide air corridor used by foreign carriers flying 
over cuba officials said 
he asked if he could deviate to the left or right american 
spokesman jim brown said they refused to let him do it 
no permission came and as a result they had to ride it on 
through they couldnt have made a uturn within the air corridor 
brown said 
the 180 passengers were told to buckle their seat belts the 
seven flight attendants were tossed by the storm and a lightning 
strike as they tried to put away food trays and other loose items 
officials said 
american is considering rerouting its caribbean and latin 
american flights around cuba brown said 
ken van auken area manager for miamis air route traffic control 
center said there normally is good cooperation between us and 
cuban air traffic controllers 
american spokesman john raymond said one of the injured flight 
attendants was treated at a kingston hospital but he had no

owners of small aircraft and several members of 
congress are trying to get the government to reconsider a new rule 
that leaves thousands of planes with no place to land near the 
nations biggest cities 
the federal aviation administration said the order requiring 
altitude signalling devices on all planes flying within 30 miles of 
the most congested airports should significantly reduce the danger 
of midair collisions the faa rule took effect saturday 
but pilots and small plane owners say it will clutter air traffic 
control screens effectively bar 40000 planes from 1200 airports 
near big cities and do nothing to enhance safety 
under the rule only planes carrying mode c transponders can fly 
within 30 miles of the nations 27 most congested airports mode c 
sends a signal telling air traffic controllers where the plane is 
and at what altitude 
the transponders have always been required for planes that use 
major airports but they have not previously been required for 
lowaltitude flights past the airports or for access to smaller 
general aviation airports that fall within the 30mile veils 
patricia weil spokeswoman for the 290000member aircraft owners 
and pilots association said the order will effectively put 
offlimits to nonmode c planes all the airports in the los angeles 
basin scores of public and private airports and helipads around 
washington dc and hundreds of airports near other cities that 
serve vital business and medical air traffic 
we can no longer fly under the wedding cake ms weil said 
referring to the air traffic control rules that previously allowed 
small planes to fly within progressively lower altitudes as they get 
nearer major airports like flying under an inverted wedding cake 
jerry walbrun of the 125000member experimental aircraft 
association of oshkosh wisc said the rule will overburden air 
traffic controllers 
its a little bit like trying to use computers to control 
traffic in downtown washington he said adding that the traffic 
control system is not geared to watch the scores of small planes 
flying well below the altitude of major airliners 
the faa has imposed a situation that will not enhance safety 
and put it into effect more quickly than their own system can 
handle he said 
many pilots are faced with the prospect of either spending from 
900 to 2000 to equip their planes with mode c or move their 
airplanes to moreremote airports 
the faa in justifying the new rule said it will have a major 
positive impact on safety by providing air traffic controllers with 
vital altitude information so potential conflicts between aircraft 
can be safely resolved 
but last week 18 house members sent a letter to transportation 
secretary samuel skinner calling for him to delay implementation of 
the rule until provisions can be made for access to smaller airports 
that fall within the veils 
the fact is that safety does not require universal installment 
of automatic altitude reporting transponders the lawmakers said 
adding that government should not impose unnecessary regulations 
that impose great cost on private individuals 
the congress members said that if the mode c requirement were 
limited to areas around major airports that are reached by radar 
rather than the arbitrary 30mile limit it would open up 600 to 700 
smaller general aviation airports 
the faa has exempted from the rule antique aircraft balloons and 
other aircraft without electrical systems necessary to run 
transponders 
the agency also acknowledged last week that many aircraft owners 
may have postponed purchase of mode c units awaiting the outcome of 
an aircraft owners challenge to the rule which the faa rejected 
only two weeks ago 
to accommodate them 90day exemptions are being granted over the 
phone pilots who want to fly within a restricted area can call air 
traffic control authorities at the individual airport to get the 
exemptions 
the faa also indicated longer exemptions could be given for some 
operators who regularly use airports on the fringes of the veil in 
areas without radar coverage or for aircraft that cannot be equipped 
to handle mode c but written requests are required 
the transponder rule is to be extended to 111 additional airports 
at the end of next year 
aviation maps printed by the commerce department already show the 
forbidden zones so pilots have known for some time where they wont 
be able to fly

thousands of people chanting we 
want religious freedom packed a prague square on saturday to mark 
the birthday of cardinal frantisek tomasek a critic of state 
control of the church 
about 3000 people gathered in the square outside tomaseks home 
following a special mass at nearby st vitus cathedral celebrating 
the roman catholic leaders 90th birthday 
long live our cardinal the crowd chanted as tomasek appeared 
on the balcony overlooking the square we want religious freedom 
czechoslovakia is the only soviet bloc country where communist 
authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious 
leaders for many of the countrys 13 dioceses 
tomasek is a strong advocate of less state supervision of church 
affairs church officials estimate that half of czechoslovakias 15 
million people are catholic 
earlier about 8000 people from across czechoslovakia filled st 
vitus cathedral for the mass also attending were highranking roman 
catholic clergy from the vatican poland hungary west germany and 
other nations foreign dignitaries included us ambassador julian 
m niemczyk 
during the mass a special envoy from the vatican read a letter 
from pope john paul ii applauding tomaseks work 
john paul praised tomasek for all that you have patiently 
endured and for devoting himself to the defense of the rights of 
the church and of mankind according to the letter read by italian 
archbishop francesco colassuono 
the popes letter also mentioned tomaseks pain and exile 
during his career an apparent reference to tomaseks 195154 
internment in a labor camp after a communist crackdown on religion 
in a short address tomasek stressed the importance of the church 
in czechoslovakia only christ can give an answer to the hunger of 
our minds for truth and to the thirst of our hearts for love 
tomasek said at the mass 
on the square some political activists circulated a human rights 
petition that has angered communist authorities 
the petition demands the right to hold political demonstrations 
freedom for all political prisoners and a reassessment by communist 
authorities of the 1968 prague spring reforms which were crushed by 
a sovietled invasion that year 
communist authorities have hinted that the signatories might be 
disciplined for their initiative the communist party newspaper rude 
pravo on saturday called the petition an appeal to disrupt the 
republic

after david martin his wife and his attorney 
gave up trying to audit the accounts he held as a private closing 
agent in atlanta for the department of housing and urban 
development the government decided to take a crack at it 
when hud auditors finished the math they said martin owed the 
government more than 16 million for the period 19841987 but had 
only half that in the separate accounts he was required to keep for 
proceeds from the sale of singlefamily homes for the agency 
martins story is like dozens of others tales that together show 
an agency with little control over its private agents and even less 
control over its own accounting for the hundreds of millions of 
dollars the agents handle 
in martins case the auditors decided 839812 was missing from 
accounts 
martins attorney protested reminding the auditors they had 
spent time at martins home and should be well aware of his modest 
lifestyle and extremely modest financial base 
the attorney eugene novy of atlanta said in a letter december 
1987 to hud that martin could no longer afford to pay for legal 
services and that the governments efforts to trace the money are 
fruitless 
the government disagrees and is trying to recover the money plus 
interest in a 75 million civil suit 
audits of closing agents in los angeles tampa buffalo phoenix 
and elsewhere produced similar findings most of the agents were 
sending hud its money late some werent sending it at all hud 
already strapped for funds because of reagan administration 
cutbacks was losing millions of dollars a year in interest 
delays by closing agents in remitting sales proceeds cost hud 
over 16 million in fiscal year 1987 the agencys inspector 
generals office concluded after a nationwide audit of huds sales 
and acquisitions of singlefamily homes one of numerous agency 
programs the same report said records for the singlefamily program 
had discrepancies involving 38000 properties and 834 million 
dollars 
the inspector generals report and related audits of closing 
agents in several areas of the country were obtained under the 
freedom of information act they are receiving close scrutiny by law 
enforcement officials and members of congress as part of 
investigations in hud mismanagement and influencepeddling during 
the reagan years 
the documents show closing agents although required to wire hud 
its money within a day of completing a sale routinely held the 
money in almost all cases at first for a few extra days and then 
as the mounting indiscretions went unnoticed for longer periods 
weeks then months and in many cases two or more years 
during a 31month period the escrow company remitted 109 
million of sales proceeds to hud an average of 47 days late a los 
angeles audit found the delays cost hud 11 million in lost 
potential interest income 
that company us escrow co of downey calif made just one of 
the 1576 payments it handled over the nearly threeyear period on 
time some were up to 258 days late hud records show 
the owner claimed he did not know about the payment deadline hud 
records show it was listed in his contract with the agency and had 
on other occasions explicitly discussed it with the company 
melvin parsons president of the us escrow said in a telephone 
interview that the company disputed the findings of the audit but 
settled the case last year for 250000 
it was cheaper for us to settle it than to go into court he 
said thursday 
a review of 37 cases in tampa fla found that late payments 
cost the government more than 18000 
in buffalo ny an audit of a onetime hud broker found that he 
withheld payments overbilled and paid himself advances from hud 
money when he died two years ago he was almost 73000 in arrears 
to the government and his widow later withdrew money from a hud 
escrow account according to department records she has agreed to 
repay the money hud officials say 
in montgomery ala auditors said ricks linddavis real estate 
co failed to pay hud 2 million and was late in remitting an 
additional 38 million from sales between august 1984 to november 
1987 costing the government more than 320000 in interest 
federal authorities still are trying to recover that money 
according to hud officials 
some of the agents mingled hud money with private and other 
checking accounts conceivably earning interest that should have 
been going to the government according to documents 
hud was not detecting the late payments because of sloppy or 
nonexistent recordkeeping some office kept records on index cards 
others had so few computers that workers had to go from the first 
floor to the ninth of a regional hud office to use one 
many offices accepted slips requesting wire time to transfer 
money to hud instead of actual transmittal receipts from closing 
agents many of whom never actually transferred the funds the 
documents show

the reformation liturgy of england will flicker 
briefly in a few hundred of the countrys 11000 anglican churches 
on sunday the 500th birthday of thomas cranmer architect of 
englands historic prayers 
at st gilesinthefields off charing cross road in london a 
special peal of bells is planned and the rector the rev gordon 
taylor will use cranmers book of common prayer as he does at all 
services 
taylor is one of the few clergymen of the state church of england 
who cling to the old prayer book that appeared in 1549 when cranmer 
was archbishop of canterbury 
the traditionalists scorn the alternative service book written 
in contemporary english and published in 1980 which was ordered by 
the general synod of bishops clergy and laity ruling the church 
the new book has almost entirely supplanted cranmers 
rapid social and intellectual changes have made it 
desirable that new understandings of worship should find expression 
in new forms and styles the editors wrote in the new books 
preface 
i wouldnt think of using anything else but the book of common 
prayer and i havent done so in the 51 years ive been a parson 
taylor said in an interview 
i dont understand why the old prayers were abandoned if some 
people want something else god bless em but not me he said 
anthony kilmister chairman of the prayer book society which has 
campaigned to keep the old prayers for most of 20 years said he 
doubted whether more than a few hundred churches would remember 
cranmer on sunday 
cranmer was a liturgical genius who encapsulated the church 
of englands doctrinal standard in a heightened english which has 
become timeless kilmister said 
it is sad indeed that we have not found another cranmer to 
write a modern prayer book perhaps it will take another 500 
years he said 
cranmer as archbishop of canterbury dissolved king henry viiis 
marriage to catherine of aragon in 1533 and crowned anne boleyn 
queen the divorce was forbidden by pope clement vii and cranmer 
became englands first protestant archbishop when the king broke 
with rome and set up the church of england the next year 
cranmer encouraged the translation of the bible from latin into 
english ordering a copy to be placed in every church and directed 
the translation and ordering of the litany from latin 
he lived in turbulent times and died a martyr 
cranmer stood by during the kings purges and killings he was 
hated by the roman catholic queen mary i for trying to block her 
accession under pressure he recanted his protestant beliefs but 
finally defied the queen and went to his death at the stake in 
oxford in 1556 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie has publicly gone on 
record as regretting the ouster of the old prayer book which he 
said was too hurried 
runcie told the associated press on friday cranmers prayers 
have consecrated the souls of englishspeaking people through the 
centuries and enriched our language his sense of the majesty of god 
and the mercy of christ never failed him it was that which with 
all his faults made him a great archbishop a true patriot and a 
sensitive christian 
runcie will open an exhibition about cranmer at the british 
library on oct 26 and preach at a commemorative service in 
westminster abbey on nov 7

imposing a more diabolical form of punishment on teenagers taking

drugs that includes stiffer prison terms and expanded education and 
treatment programs idaho and new mexico are imposing taxes on 
illegal drugs a ploy that is intended to take the profit out of 
drug trafficking according to idaho attorney general jim jones 
the new alcohol abuse laws are aimed primarily at keeping 
drinkers from operating vehicles on land on sea and in the air 
in virginia where drivers previously could sip alcohol behind 
the wheel so long as they didnt get drunk drinking while driving

chinas communist party celebrated its 68th 
birthday saturday by announcing an investigation into how its 
members behaved during the recent protests for democracy it said 
some could be severely punished 
thousands of people took vows as new party members in tiananmen 
square tourists flocked to the gate of heavenly peace which 
overlooks the square and was opened to civilians for the first time 
since the military crackdown last month 
with the partys image at a new low because of widespread 
corruption and the crackdown party leaders turned to aging veterans 
of the 1949 revolution to lead the internal investigation 
newly appointed party chief jiang zemin told a gathering of 
several dozen semiretired officials most in their 70s or older 
that they were expected to help in an earnest rectification 
extending from ideology to party organization 
the meeting was shown on national television not a single 
youthful official was seen as the camera panned the room many of 
those present wore hearing aids or slumped wearily in their chairs 
the party newspaper the peoples daily signaled in a frontpage 
editorial that the shakeup would not be restricted to the partys 
top levels where it began with the recent ouster of party chief 
zhao ziyang 
some party branches it said were weak and lax and did not 
carry out their roles as fortresses in battle 
the recent turmoil severely tested every party member 
the editorial said it is necessary to strictly check on the 
performance of every party member in the struggle 
those deserving criticism and education should be criticized 
and educated and those deserving sanctions should be punished it 
said adding that discipline should be severe the strength of the 
communist party is not in its numbers but in the quality of its 
members 
since the army entered beijing on june 34 and used tanks and 
machine guns to quell studentled protests for a freer society 
party units have held frequent meetings to study the new party line 
defending the crackdown 
however there have been no reports of party members being purged 
on the grassroots level many party members took part in the 
studentled marches and punishment has been expected 
the chinese communist party was founded in 1921 by a dozen men 
who gathered surreptitiously in a girls school and had flee to a 
rowboat in the middle of a lake when police learned of the session 
the peoples daily acknowledged that some chinese have lost 
confidence in the party in recent years partly because many members 
use their privileged status to sell favors or siphon off official 
funds strengthening the 47 millionmember party is a matter of 
life and death it said 
the party also celebrated its birthday in a more lighthearted 
manner with dancing and singing in tiananmen square which was 
opened to organized groups that had obtained permission from 
authorities the vast square where students demanding reform staged 
rallies in april and may was filled with people taking party vows 
and soldiers who sang without the communist party there would be 
no new china 
the ornate 17thcentury gate of heavenly peace tiananmen in 
chinese overlooking the square was reopened to all civilians for 
the first time since the crackdown more than 2200 tourists nearly 
all chinese flocked to the gate getting autographs from gen wang 
fuyi one of the army commanders who brought troops in to quell the 
protests 
plainclothes security men wearing straw hats or holding 
walkietalkies stood along the marble railing from which mao 
tsetungs portrait hangs 
the partys birthday celebration coincided with an american 
birthday party as the us embassy celebrated independence day early 
as it does every year the embassy threw a party american 
residents in beijing but many americans fled beijing when the army 
moved in and only about 200 people attended the bash compared with 
1500 last year 
eight chinese police with submachine guns took up posts outside 
the embassy but refused to say why they were there they may have 
hoped for an appearance by dissident fang lizhi and his wife who 
are wanted by police and have been hiding at the embassy 
education officials meanwhile said more attention would be paid 
to political attitudes when approving student applications to 
study abroad the official china daily reported the step appeared 
part of a series of measures to prevent people accused of joining 
the protests from leaving the country 
china sends about 8000 students abroad to study each year 
official newspapers also announced the start of the trial of 
three men accused of throwing paint may 23 on the portrait of mao 
that hangs from the gate of heavenly peace the peoples daily said 
they were charged with counterrevolutionary actvities 
the three a magazine editor a teacher and a factory worker 
were turned over to police by student protesters who condemned the 
defacing authorities hung a new mao portrait hours later 
the trial like most in china was closed to foreign media

when jiang zemin was named head of the worlds 
largest communist party he inherited more than a powerful position 
he inherited a load of serious problems 
jiang successor to the disgraced zhao ziyang must deal with the 
aftermath of the governments suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement and with an economy slipping out of control 
he also must live in the shadow of his two successors the late 
hu yaobang and zhao both purged for failing to clamp down on the 
democratic impulses of youth 
jiangs political future seems to rest on the health of 
84yearold senior leader deng xiaoping and the desires of other 
party elders who strongly believe in the communist ideology that has 
ruled china for 40 years 
it depends as so much has in the last weeks on what one old 
man decides to do thats where it becomes unpredictable because 
its one old man said an asian diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
jiang already is being compared to hua guofeng chinas titular 
head during the transitional years of political instability between 
the 1976 death of mao tsetung and the rise of deng 
there probably will not be more prodemocracy demonstrations in 
the near future like the one crushed when soldiers drove thousands 
of protesters from tiananmen square on june 34 
but the willingness of people to put up with political repression 
may be tied to how well the economy performs and to living standards 
premier li peng last fall announced a twoyear austerity plan 
designed to slow economic growth to curb inflation running about 30 
percent in urban areas 
industry was growing so quickly that it was taxing raw material 
and energy supplies also banks were issuing loans for new 
construction and expansion without getting old loans back adding to 
the inflationary pressures 
lis plan has had modest success the industrial growth rate has 
been shaved from about 20 percent last year to 11 percent and 
inflation has dropped slightly 
but factories cant pay their bills because credit has dried up 
and exporters are reneging on contracts because they lack the raw 
materials needed for production 
a deepening energy crisis is forcing factories to shut down for 
days each week and severe shortages of some raw materials have 
contributed to rampant corruption factories often have to pay off 
officials who obtain materials at low stateset prices and resell 
them for handsome profits 
unemployment which according to official estimates will rise to 
3 percent from 2 percent this year has caused great social despair 
millions of people mostly peasants from the countryside have been 
put out of work by the cancellation of construction projects and 
have been left to drift from town to town looking for work 
premier lis economic measures have all but stopped economic 
reforms particularly changes crucial to bringing prices in line 
with market values and easing serious supplydemand gaps 
the purge of zhao one of the pioneers of chinas marketoriented 
reforms and his followers will deprive the nation of some of its 
most innovative economists 
economic thinkers will at best be under a cloud said a 
western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity there will 
be a lot less intellectual energy 
diplomats also speculated that jiang will like premier li be 
more comfortable with central planning models that zhao tried to 
dismantle 
that would not bode well for flagging efforts to restructure 
chinas economic base 
in the first three months of 1989 before students took to the 
streets to demand political reforms 22 percent of staterun 
enterprises lost money the amount of losses made up by the state 
treasury was the equivalent of 1 billion up 120 percent from the 
same period in 1988 
foreign businessmen who fled when the crackdown began now are 
returning but the political turmoil could seriously affect chinas 
foreign business relations 
the us embassy says a travel advisory urging businessmen and 
tourists to stay away from china remains in effect one embassy 
official said safety concerns continue and cited a recent incident 
in which troops fired into the air when a car driven by an american 
businessman backfired as it pulled away from a military checkpoint 
jiang who worked to attract foreign investment to the city of 
shanghai where he was party chief before his promotion may have 
been picked by deng partly to reassure the outside world that china 
will keep its doors open to the west 
but new foreign investment which china badly needs for its 
modernization drive likely has been severely hurt by the crackdown 
the united states japan and the european economic community have

the navys oldest civilian employee an 
89yearold engineer has retired and is going back to germany 
where he launched a career in aviation that spanned six decades 
rudy ries came to this country in 1928 and worked for 35 years 
for companies that pioneered in aviation fairchild convair 
martin edo aircraft and for fokker in the netherlands he helped 
design pontoons for the planes flown by charles lindbergh to china 
and by adm richard byrd to the south pole 
ive enjoyed my work all of it he said sadly at a 
retirement ceremony at the naval training systems center on friday 
i will miss it 
he said he would fly to bonn west germany this weekend to live 
with his son a civil engineer posted with the us state department 
there 
the diminutive softspoken ries worked only 26 years for the 
navy department starting in 1963 
born in frankfurt he joined the german air force during world 
war i but he hadnt completed pilot training when it ended in 
1928 he saw the onset of nazism in his country and came to america 
he became a citizen in 1930 the year he joined edo on new yorks 
long island 
lindbergh and his wife were flying to china and he wanted 
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane with a motor in 
between in case he landed in the water ries said 
the lindberghs returned to edo after their flight to china and 
had lunch with ries and other company officials 
i loaned him my pocket knife to cut his onions with and ive 
still got that knife ries said 
another highlight of his two stints at edo was the design of an 
allmetal airplane designed to operate at 30000 feet a twoseater 
named the modelr in his honor the depression caused the company to 
cut back work on it and the modelr was never flown 
in 1936 ries went to work for consolidated aircraft in 
california which later became convair 
from there he and 20 other engineers and assistants were sent to 
the soviet union to help in setting up an assembly plant after 
spending more than a year in the ukraine he got a job at fokker 
aircraft co in amsterdam but ries european stay was cut short 
with the approach of world war ii and he returned to this country 
a handson mechanical engineer he admitted frustration with his 
professions increasing reliance on paperwork which he called 
letters to santa claus 
i enjoy engineering i think engineering is designing things 
creating things he said but one thing weve turned to now is 
just writing specifications for somebody else to build 
something i dont like this 
in recent years he has designed training simulators for the 
controllers who explode tomahawk and harm missiles when they fail to 
detonate or go off course he also is responsible for the design of 
a training aid for the militarys newest torpedo the mark 50 which 
can be dropped from an airplane or fired from land or ships at sea

two miles south of the border said he started getting frantic phone 
calls friday morning from residents reporting the monkeys on the 
loose 
the animals are mischievous but not dangerous he said

monkey invasion but could not spare any troopers to help round up 
the animals 
john gillen district ranger for the state department of 
environmental conservation said his office was leaving the roundup 
to the zoos employees 
whatever monkeys elude capture by zookeepers probably will return

after weeks or months in us 
government custody airborne central american deportees finally had 
a leisurely meal and a choice chicken or fish 
there were no more guards giving them five minutes to eat at the 
crowded us immigration and naturalization service detention camp 
near the mexican border city of brownsville texas aboard the taca 
international jetliner they enjoyed courteous service from flight 
attendants 
no more dressing like a carrot in the orange ins detainee 
jump suits issued at the corralon the big corral their 
nickname for the ins port isabel service processing center 
the 59 salvadorans guatemalans and hondurans devoured the 
airline food on the way to san salvador 
they clowned and laughed a lot for people who had spent 
everything for a better life in the north and failed 
the drudgery of detention made even the poverty and violence back 
home seem better 
these are the unfortunate people no money isidro ramirez 
an officer at the south texas immigration jail said while 
overseeing their departure from the camp the only place they got 
to visit in america was this 
they did not know when they would leave until their names were 
called on a recent day on the camp loudspeakers 
ins officials returned the clothes money and few possessions the 
aliens had when apprehended took a second set of fingerprints 
compared faces with booking photos and herded them onto a bus 
the ins harlingen district in southern texas is the closest us 
border crossing point to central america the district spent 18 
million last year to operate the detention camp not including 
salaries and another 425000 on deportations mostly on air fares 
to central america 
the deportees included 668 salvadorans 317 hondurans and 312 
guatemalans 
nationwide in fiscal 1988 the united states deported 2711 
salvadorans 2049 guatemalans 1312 hondurans and 36 nicaraguans 
on the sevenhour bus ride to houston manuel martinez 22 
lamented his failure to get a job in the united states but looked 
forward to seeing his daughter born during his threemonth detention 
thats why its not so bad to go back said martinez an 
exsoldier in the salvadoran army 
he said he fled his home in the eastern province of san miguel 
because he was desperate for work and because of threats from 
leftist guerrillas fighting the government 
few of the deportees had bothered to apply for political asylum 
in their appearances before an immigration judge because friends 
told them it was not worth suffering an even longer detention only 
to be turned down 
asylum is granted only to those judged to be fleeing political 
persecution 
this group of deportees had a false start their bus had to turn 
back halfway to houston because of flooding 
send the airplane here to pick us up shouted maria reyna 
quintanilla 24 another native of san miguel when ins officer 
joseph russell announced it would be impossible to get to the 
houston airport that night 
i have bad luck said jorge valencia marin 30 who lives 
near san salvador wondering why he could not even get deported when 
he was ready i was already looking forward to seeing my family 
again 
the next day the bus reached houston the deportees arrived 
about 130 am and slept on the floor of an area the ins leases in 
an industrial park near the airport 
the airplane flight was the first for most of them 
but not for juan montufar alvarez 29 a guatemalan who spent the 
trip reading his bible it was his third time to be deported from 
the united states and his third plane trip 
at the airport in san salvador the guatemalans and hondurans 
were transferred to flights for their countries 
the salvadorans waited in an immigration line near a wall with 
posters showing a little girl with one leg and the caption 
innocent victim of fmln guerrilla mines what about her human 
rights 
the more than 30 salvadoran deportees were told to wait at the 
immigration desk until the pilot brought their package of 
deportation papers then they were waved through without 
interrogation or a search of their luggage by the soldiers 
downstairs in camouflage gear 
several had no money and stood in front of the airport 
bewildered wondering how they would make it 20 miles to the capital 
and then home

americans in beijing celebrated an early fourth of 
july on saturday with a barbecue and imported beer but without the 
street dances and rock music that characterized previous years 
bashes 
only about 200 people showed up for the cookout on the patio of 
one of the three us embassy compounds in beijings main diplomatic 
sector that compared to the 1500 who attended the block party last 
year the 1988 bash featured rock bands as well as mcdonalds 
hamburgers that the fastfood chain flew in from hong kong 
many americans fled beijing when china declared martial law in 
may and when troops moved last month to crush studentled protests 
for democratic reforms 
at noon on saturday eight police guards armed with submachine 
guns appeared around the embassy complex but refused to say why they 
were there they may have hoped for an appearance by dissident fang 
lizhi and his wife who are wanted by police and have been hiding at 
the embassy 
it was the first time in weeks that guards outside the embassy 
had weapons police guards with handguns are stationed outside each 
diplomatic mission in beijing but since the military crackdown june 
34 their holsters have been empty 
i wouldnt read a lot into it said mckinney russell 
director at the embassy of the us information agency every time 
theres any kind of movement the police presence is stepped up 
the chinese outside the embassy gate were police normally 
assigned to the embassy according to a us marine guard who said 
he knows them well 
same guys new guns the marine said 
the guards were stationed around the us facility temporarily 
and will scale back their numbers after july 4 one of the guards 
said 
about 70 police showed up at the fourth of july party last year 
diplomats said 
i didnt think that was excessive said one foreign service 
officer speaking on condition of anonymity they were there to 
keep chinese from looking in at us through the bars but they ended 
up looking at us through the bars 
there was no extra security at the july fourth party in 1987 
according to diplomats who were in beijing then

antiabortion activists anxiously 
awaiting a possible supreme court decision monday on abortion rights 
are gearing up for what they see as the next phase of their campaign 
war in the states 
the national right to life committee which was winding up its 
threeday convention here saturday is hopeful the high court will 
at the very least return authority to the states to decide whether 
to restrict abortion 
if that happens theres a realistic expectation that 
pennsylvania wisconsin probably minnesota and possibly ohio could 
be among the first states to consider abortion curbs said burke 
balch the committees state legislative coordinator 
state action on abortion laws would depend on various issues 
including timing many legislatures dont convene again until 1990 
or 1991 what were talking about is an extremely long hard 
struggle here balch said 
a missouri case webster vs reproductive health services is 
pending before the supreme court and a decision is expected monday 
missouris law puts restrictions on abortions and defines life as 
beginning at conception upholding the missouri law or even parts 
of it could reverse or seriously erode the 1973 landmark decision 
roe vs wade legalizing abortion 
many abortion opponents here believe a total reversal of roe is 
highly unlikely but they feel this court is their best chance since 
1973 to return the issue to local lawmakers and thus give abortion 
opponents the chance to advance their goals on a statebystate 
basis 
restrictive steps that balch said would be most likely to be 
introduced are parental consent and notification laws and measures 
to give fathers a say in abortion decisions 
a parental consent law that was to have taken effect saturday in 
tennessee was struck down friday by a federal judge who declared the 
law unconstitutionally vague 
abortion foes say that if the supreme court upholds even part of 
the missouri law it would be a victory and a signal to forge ahead 
if it goes in any direction in our favor the first step 
youll see is politically and legislatively a great push in all 
50 states said paul odonnell a franciscan brother attending the 
convention the prolife movement is just going to move forward 
and intensify 
this is phase ii he said the first phase was 16 years 
ago when roe vs wade was decided 
its going to be a state fight whatever happens said sam 
lee a missouri antiabortion activist and an architect of the 
measure before the high court 
abortion opponents already are talking about special legislative 
sessions petition drives and increased lobbying efforts 
the legislators are feeling the faint heat coming down the pike 
and its just getting hotter said brenda hucks director of south 
carolina citizens for life theyre also going to feel heat from 
proabortion folks and the media theyll be in the spotlight 
lawmakers have had some easy dodges said roger mall 
director of the iowa right to life committee theyd say call me 
when we can start doing something now theyre going to have to 
come out of the closet one way or another 
the national abortion rights action league said in a june report 
that both legislative houses in nine states alaska colorado 
connecticut hawaii maine new mexico north carolina virginia and 
washington along with the city council in washington dc favor 
keeping abortion legal 
the report also said 24 legislatures favor making abortion 
illegal and governors in 15 of those states support such actions 
but abortion opponents wont make such distinctions 
were not counting any state as a loss said jacki ragan 
head of the committees state organizational developmental 
department were not counting any state as a given all will be 
battlegrounds were going to give it all weve got 
they also say theyre braced for the possibility of defeat but 
remain undaunted 
were not about to pack up and go away miss hucks said 
were in it for the duration its more than a passing interest 
its a bonedeep commitment 
its our belief that whatever the result in the webster case 
that the decision in roe vs wade is in fact doomed said james 
bopp jr the committees general counsel it is simply a question 
of when it will be reversed whether it will be in this case or the 
next case or the next case but it is inevitable

which sits on the squares northern end and is the main entrance to

toll could be as high as 3000 
everybody says it is all right now she said

square but were not allowed to stop 
students demanding democracy press freedom and a clean 
government demonstrated in the square for seven weeks until the 
military crackdown officials say there was no firing inside the 
square itself and that no deaths took place there but student 
witnesses dispute this 
the monument to the peoples heroes inside the square which the 
students used as a podium during their protests was draped saturday 
with two long crimson banners proclaiming long live the great 
chinese communist party and firmly support the communique of the 
fourth central committee 
it was at the party central committees fourth session last 
weekend that party secretary general zhao ziyang who sympathized 
with the students was ousted

a former us navy intelligence analyst who 
defected to the soviet union killed himself by inhaling carbon 
monoxide and his last wish was to be buried in his kgb uniform 
official media said saturday 
in providing details for the first time about glenn michael 
southers death june 22 the official tass news agency said he 
went to the garage started his car closed the garage door and 
lay down on the back seat of the car leaving the door half open the 
car filled with carbon monoxide 
his body was discovered the next morning when he failed to appear 
for a ride to work tass said 
the communist party daily pravda said souther 32 was considered 
a top soviet spy he belonged with such outstanding soldiers of 
the invisible front as kim philby and george blake british 
intelligence officers who spied for the soviet union 
souther defected in 1986 when the fbi began investigating him and 
joined the soviet secret police the kgb when he defected the 
hammond ind native was working as a satellite photograph analyst 
at the navys 2nd fleet headquarters in norfolk va 
pravda said he had access to the most valuable documents on the 
top secret plans for use of the us navy in a nuclear war against 
the soviet union and other socialist countries 
tass described souther as a man with a great soul a romantic 
who was very impressionable and sensitive 
it said as an intelligence officer he lived under constant 
strain he had a nervous breakdown tass said 
souther who took the soviet name mikhail orlov after he 
defected wrote a letter to his colleagues at the kgb containing his 
last request according to the news reports 
justice demands you hear my last words i do not regret our 
relationship it was a longstanding one and helped me grow as a 
person the letter said i wish to be buried in the uniform of 
an officer of the kgb 
neither tass nor pravda said whether the request was granted but 
kgb chief gen vladimir kryuchko said on wednesday that souther was 
given a military funeral monday 
previous soviet news reports said southers parents traveled to 
the soviet union for the funeral 
pravda said souther had become disillusioned with some aspects of 
life in the soviet union and that his colleagues noted he suffered 
occasional bouts of depression 
of course not everything glenn met in the soviet land was as 
he had expected the newspaper said for example he could never 
comprehend that it is possible to drop into a store and be unable to 
find some needed item

barbecues are easier still devoted 
new englanders scramble for the right seaweed the right rocks and 
the right canvas for a traditional july fourth clambake 
and a couple of hundred enthusiasts have even been willing to 
spend 50 and head back to college to learn how to do it right 
terry parker 48 said he signed up for the university of rhode 
islands clambake course because last year he had a july fourth 
clambake for about 100 people and it was a disaster 
with roughly 1000 invested in food they salvaged what they 
could and boiled it on a propane stove said his friend dana 
jones 32 
in contrast to a barbecue which in new england may simply 
involve throwing steaks onto a portable grill a clambake requires a 
pit with whitehot rocks on which a mix of seafood is steamed or 
baked with potatoes corn and other ingredients many people hire 
commercial bake masters 
to have a clambake that doesnt work is very embarrassing 
parker said 
the course offered for three years through uris narragansett 
bay classroom is hardly a typical academic experience 
while students arrive with pen and paper one even brought a 
video camera so he wouldnt forget a thing they also brought 
suntan lotion and cold beer 
nonetheless theyre really into it parker said people 
are here to learn how to do clambakes 
about 200 students have taken the noncredit class in the seven 
times it has been offered said sarah hickox bay classroom 
coordinator and assistant director of uri marine programs it is 
usually a full class she said 
at 9 am on a recent saturday on a hill overlooking 
narragansett bay class began 
the water was calm the sun was up and the beach was empty it 
was gorgeous parker said 
class began with a study of tide charts to determine where and 
when to collect the seaweed that will cover the rocks preparation 
of the pit was next then how to coordinate the fire and rocks 
he taught us what rocks to use and what rocks not to use i 
wasnt aware of it jones said the wrong type of rocks break 
apart under the intense temperature of the steaming food and release 
the heat 
there was a lengthy dissertation on seaweed parker said 
one can be used and is very effective while the other type 
doesnt generate enough steam to cook the food without scorching it 
the trick is to keep the seaweed from burning you want it to 
boil jones said its also important to get untreated canvas to 
cover the food as it bakes 
im really amazed its as scientific as it is parker said 
i guess there are a lot of things that can go wrong 
the class assignment was to find the right seaweed so 20 
students headed to the beach 
you should have seen us collecting the seaweed down there 
said carolyn gaudreau 45 of marlborough conn i thought eight 
bushel baskets would take us a couple of hours but it only took 
us about 20 minutes 
the steamers were purchased as were mussels fish fillets 
lobsters sausages sweet and white potatoes corn on the cob and 
onions 
my family did clambakes years ago but i never paid much 
attention to it said roberta baker 49 ive never put one on 
myself thats what id like to do 
a lot of new englanders are fascinated with the mystique of a 
traditional clambake hickox saidwhat this does is allow them to 
do something that appears very complex in their own back yard 
while the food cooks the students sample clam chowder and crab 
cakes made earlier in the day less than an hour later bake master 
thad gruczka tests the cooking time by sticking a knife in the

solidarity legislators decided saturday 
against offering lech walesa as a presidential candidate because the 
political system is not yet democratic enough a spokesman said 
the opposition lawmakers also decided to withhold taking a stand 
on the communist partys choice for president until just before the 
meeting of the national assembly which will choose the president 
that meeting is expected sometime this week 
the legislators said it would be best if there were more than one 
candidate 
we are waiting for decisions of the coalition around the polish 
united workers communist party as to what candidate it will 
recommend or rather what candidates parliamentary deputy 
bronislaw geremek told state television after the meeting 
the leader of the communist party gen wojciech jaruzelski 
announced friday he did not want to be a nominee and he endorsed 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak the party has asked 
jaruzelski to reconsider 
solidarity legislators met saturday to decide what stand to take 
in relation to the election 
as goes for the candidates from the coalition communist side 
we will assume our stand on the eve of the election that is on the 
eve of the first session of the national assembly solidarity 
parliament deputy janusz onyszkiewicz told a news conference 
during the daylong debate solidarity considered putting up its 
own candidate the obvious choice would be soldidarity leader lech 
walesa onyszkiewicz said but he added the time is not good for 
walesa now 
we are not in a democratic system and we dont think that lech 
walesa should be the president in this system which is not fully 
democratic he said walesa said in the past that he would not run 
for president 
the president who is limited to two sixyear terms will be 
commanderinchief of the armed forces and be responsible for 
foreign relations he may dissolve parliament for new elections and 
declare one 90day state of emergency 
the sejm or parliament and the senate will convene in separate 
sessions for the first time july 4 their first joint session as the 
national assembly is expected later in the week that is when the 
president will be chosen 
officials want the president in office before president bush 
arrives for a threeday visit july 9 
the communist coalition has a 300259 advantage but there are 
some internal divisions 
communist party spokesman jan bisztyga said friday a meeting will 
be held to choose between jaruzelski and kiszczak before the 
national assembly meeting 
among the options considered at the solidarity meeting were the 
possibilities of finding a party or neutral candidate the opposition 
could support 
some people at the meeting including walesa said it would be 
best if there were several candidates not one said onyszkiewicz 
who is also national spokesman for the solidarity trade union 
in an interview on state television saturday walesa said the 
president needed to be someone who could unite all poles 
jaruzelski is linked to the 1981 martial law crackdown in which 
thousands of union activists were interned solidarity was outlawed 
the following year the communist party chief cited this association 
in the public eye as his reason for not wanting to be a candidate 
kiszczak helped crush solidarity after martial law but he won 
back confidence from the opposition by leading the government in 
negotiations that led to solidaritys legalization and the elections 
for the national assembly 
the elections were the freest in poland since world war ii and 
included opposition candidates for the first time

the chairmans plan was simple let members of 
the house armed services committee load down the defense bill with 
so many porkbarrel amendments it would collapse under its weight 
such a bill never materialized 
the committee did vote to restore money for the v22 osprey 
helicopter and f14d tomcat fighter by reducing spending for the b2 
stealth bomber but it refrained from any other major additions and 
found the money by cutting other programs 
then against the advice of chairman les aspin dwis the 
committee chose a 295 billion defense bill that reflected its own 
procurement priorities rather than those proposed by defense 
secretary dick cheney 
a leaner meaner version aspin said a day after the 
wednesday vote as he compared the final committee package to the 
71 billion in addons members had originally sought 
members of the panel explained that their plan remained within 
cheneys budget numbers they also expressed dismay with pressure to 
rubberstamp a proposal crafted by a defense secretary just 39 days 
on the job 
rep curt weldon rpa joined with thomas foglietta dpa and 
norman sisisky dva to save the v22 the tiltrotor aircraft 
that is manufactured by boeing helicopter co in pennsylvania and 
bell helicopter textron inc in texas 
their amendment also restored money for the f14d which is built 
by grumman corp on long island 
to get 157 million for the marine corps v22 and about 1 
billion for the navys f14d the lawmakers reduced spending on the 
mh53 helicopters and canceled multiyear purchases of the e2c and 
fa18 aircraft 
the other amendment approved by the committee provides about 12 
billion for the national guard and reserves by reducing 500 million 
in procurement money for the air forces b2 and 524 million that 
had been earmarked for air force aircraft spares and repair parts 
cheney commenting in a statement the day after the vote said 
congress wants to cut defense spending but doesnt want to cancel 
any systems 
we must not preserve the fiction that we can keep all the 
weapons and bases everyone wants and still spend less money the 
defense secretary said 
weldon disagreed saying his amendment does not affect the 
bottom line of cheneys budget 
the pennsylvania republican said it was unfair to cancel the v22 
on the eve of testing the aircraft which is designed to take off 
like a helicopter and fly like a plane 
i like dick cheney but he got advice from pencilpushers 
weldon said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said that based on the dollar 
amount cheney got 95 percent of what he wanted 
but the ranking republican on the armed services panel rep bill 
dickinson of alabama criticized the vote calling it a bad day 
for good government because the panel failed to face the reality 
of a budget crunch and allowed business as usual 
dickinson expressed the hope that this will change when the full 
house takes up the defense bill 
but rep ron dellums dcalif who voted against the cheney 
budget objected to the good government argument 
its incumbent upon me to exercise my judgment not acquiesce to 
the secretary of defense dellums said ive been on the job 
more weeks than he ive written nine military budgets 
dellums said there was some resentment among democrats on the 
committee that the chairman suggested his own membership should 
not have a right to assess a budget 
only nine of the panels 31 democrats supported aspins amendment 
to accept the cheney budget

new york citys famed five boroughs could 
someday become four 
the legislature working into early saturday morning in an 
endofsession marathon voted to give staten island residents a 
chance to say whether they want to secede from new york city 
if gov mario cuomo signs the bill residents of the smallest 
borough might be able to vote in november 1990 on whether to take a 
bite out the big apple cuomo said saturday he hadnt decided what 
to do 
polls say staten island residents overwhelmingly favor secession 
an issue tied up with a courtmandated restructuring of the largest 
us city government 
we didnt start out with the idea of leaving the city said 
state sen john marchi a staten island republican we just wanted 
to maintain our voice in the city we didnt have anything against 
the city of new york i ran for mayor there twice 
the secession movement gathered steam after the us supreme 
court ruled in march that the board of estimate which governs city 
spending and construction was unconstitutional because it gave 
staten islands 400000 residents equal representation to the more 
populous boroughs such as brooklyn with more than 2 million people 
staten island residents fear the city charter revision 
commissions plan for revamping city government will shortchange 
their borough 
it would reduce us really to colonial status marchi said 
cuomo said he believed the legislators action was not an 
approval of secession but simply a political statement what they 
are saying is staten island ought to be protected cuomo said he 
shared those sympathies but wasnt sure how to go about providing 
such protection 
cuomo is from queens manhattan and the bronx are the other two 
boroughs 
residents of staten island have never considered themselves true 
new york city residents said elizabeth connelly a staten island 
democrat who shepherded the secession bill through the state 
assembly 
she noted though that the boroughs more upstate character has 
lessened since the verrazanonarrows bridge linked it with brooklyn 
and it began absorbing people fleeing high housing costs and other 
urban woes in other boroughs 
many leaders from the other boroughs including mayor edward i 
koch a manhattanite fear the loss of tax revenue to the city if 
staten island secedes 
lawmakers who opposed the bill also argued that all new york city 
residents should have the right to decide if part of the city should 
break away 
its fundamentally unfair to all the other residents of the 
city of new york said assemblyman anthony genovesi a 
powerful brooklyn democrat i dont think that anyone has 
considered the ramification of how it all works out 
connelly argues that staten island residents never had a say in 
the 1898 decision by the legislature that made the island a borough 
of new york city 
the 1989 bill calls for staten island voters to decide two 
questions whether staten island should break from new york city and 
whether it should form a county or city type of government the 
legislation wont allow a secession vote unless a charter revision 
is voted on in a citywide referendum this november 
even if the secession decision is a long way off and by no means 
a certainty its already unifying a borough thats been the butt of 
jokes marchi said 
there is a lot of excitement he said im telling you it 
doesnt make any difference rich or poor black or white fat or 
skinny it doesnt make any difference

president mikhail s gorbachev appealed saturday 
for an end to ethnic strife among soviet nationalities and said the 
state will not tolerate those who stir up unrest 
gorbachev spoke for the first 25 minutes of the nightly 
television news show vremya in a rare personal appeal to the nation 
that is home to more than 130 nationalities 
gorbachev called on all soviet citizens to bring an end to ethnic 
strife that has emerged in several soviet republics over the past 
two years 
as president of the ussr supreme soviet i consider it my 
duty to warn you about the mounting danger of exacerbating ethnic 
tensions gorbachev said in the speech he also warned of related 
consequences for society for every family and every person 
gorbachevs appeal follows outbreaks of violence in the republics 
of kazakhstan uzbekistan and georgia last year ethnic clashes 
erupted in the republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
the most recent violence was in kazakhstan four people died in 
the city of novy uzen last month when rioters attacked immigrants 
from the caucasus region accusing them of setting up private 
business and finagling privileges in housing and other benefits 
in june violence between ethnic meskhi turks and native uzbeks 
in the republic of uzbekistan left about 100 people dead officials 
said josef stalin ordered the migration of the turks to the 
republic in 1944 
in april 20 georgians died in clashes with soviet troops sent in 
to end a a proindependece demonstration 
gorbachev whose own policies of tolerating greater openness and 
dissent have emboldened groups seeking more autonomy blamed ethnic 
violence on the forced migrations of ethnic groups ordered by his 
predecessors 
today we are reaping the fruits of lawlessness in preceding 
decades the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the 
burying in oblivion of the national intersts of small ethnic 
groups gorbachev said 
he said that all people had to obey the laws of the land that 
guarantee a citizens rights and warned that the state will uphold 
these rights by all means at its disposal 
gorbachev said some people were taking advantage of ethnic 
frictions for personal gain this is playing with fire those who 
have embarked on this path are assuming gravest responsibility 
before their own people and before society as a whole he said 
gorbachev said most of the violence had taken place in instances 
where ethnic groups constitute a minority in small communities 
what will happen if interethnic discord spreads over to regions 
where millions of people of other nationalities live along with 
people of the indigenous nationality he asked 
he said every citizen regardless of nationality should have their 
rights protected ethnic groups should be allowed to freely develop 
their own language and culture and political and ethnic reform is 
needed in the 15 soviet republics 
gorbachev said communist party members and intellectuals should 
use their influence to quell ethnic passions 
all of us indeed cannot but be disturbed by the interethnic 
intolerance frictions and even conflicts eupting lately now here 
and now there disrupting peoples lives and resulting in a number 
of cases of human tragedies gorbachev said

provisions of a new utah law prohibiting 
cigarette vending machines were put on hold by a federal judge less 
than 12 hours before the law was to have taken effect saturday 
us district senior judge aldon janderson issued a temporary 
restraining order banning enforcement of the challenged section of 
the law after an emergency hearing friday 
sales until this matter is resolved will be the same as under 
the old law anderson ruled 
four vendingmachine companies had filed suit against the state 
friday morning requesting that the adolescent tobacco prevention 
act passed by this years legislature be declared unconstitutional 
andersons ruling prevents the vendingmachine provision of the 
law from taking effect for at least 10 days 
the vending machine ban which won widespread support from 
lawmakers is aimed in part at curbing uncontrolled access to 
cigarettes by minors it would prohibit all cigarette 
vendingmachine sales except in bars private clubs or offices and 
other work areas not open to the public 
a second hearing was scheduled for july 7 to determine whether a 
preliminary injunction should be issued until the laws 
constitutionality can be tested 
the plaintiffs claim a ban on vending machines will drive them 
out of business without restricting sales to minors any more than 
current law which already requires employees of businesses having 
cigarette machines to check customers ages before enabling the 
machines to work by remote switch 
the restraining order presented no threat of change in the sale 
of cigarettes to minors since a cashier must still check the age 
of the person buying cigarettes anderson said 
the judge made his decision despite the states claim the lawsuit 
is not a proper question for a federal court 
we do not feel there is a constitutional issue and therefore 
the plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits said assistant 
attorney general linda luinstra who argued the case involved 
questions that should be challenged in a state court 
but plaintiffs lawyer richard rappaport said the law deprives 
his clients of business without any rationale 
there is a public interest in having children not smoke he 
said theres no public interest in having adults buying 
cigarettes handtohand over the counter instead of having adults 
buy cigarettes from a machine after the business owner determines 
they are adults 
over the past week and before fridays ruling many of utahs 
vending machine companies were busy removing cigarette machines from 
restaurants hotels and other public places in anticipation of the 
new law

when martin alsobrooks was hired as an 
animal technician at a research laboratory here nobody told him the 
monkeys hed handle likely would carry a virus that could kill him 
less than three months later one of his coworkers is dead a 
former coworker is hospitalized and alsobrooks and about 30 current 
or former colleagues are on an experimental antiviral drug they 
hope will stem the rare disease in case they too have been 
infected 
the herpes b virus better known as the monkey virus is found in 
more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys a type of macaque the virus 
is harmless to the animals but more than half of the 30 cases 
documented in humans since the disease was first reported 57 years 
ago have been fatal its commonly transmitted through bites and 
scratches 
i try not to worry about things i have no control over but my 
family is worried my mother is lighting candles said alsobrooks 
33 whose blood test results were inconclusive 
thousands of these monkeys are being used daily in laboratory 
experiments nationwide while progress is being made in the area of 
animal welfare rights the conditions in which lab employees work 
are largely unregulated by federal or state law 
officials at international research and development corp say 
they have complied strictly with guidelines set by the centers for 
disease control in atlanta and that the two technicians who were 
infected did not report their wounds 
tom mcgeorge a 23yearold technician died june 20 just a few 
days after the virus was diagnosed the hospitalized former 
employee whose name is being withheld is in serious condition he 
worked at the company only one week before quitting this spring 
early detection was impossible since neither man reported his 
injuries which is required by the company said francis x wazeter 
iii irdc vice president 
when an employee reports being bitten or scratched by a monkey a 
disinfectant is promptly applied to the wound to kill the virus 
wazeter said 
some employees said bites and scratches were so common and the 
pressure to complete studies so great that it was nearly impossible 
to report each wound to the company nurse 
wazeter denied there was pressure on employees to work fast and 
said reporting wounds is mandatory he also denied allegations by 
several employees that the leather gloves used by monkey handlers 
part of the extensive protection gear usually had holes and took 
months to replace 
the cdcs guidelines which are not enforced by any regulatory 
agency were created two years ago after a herpes b outbreak in 
pensacola fla killed two monkey handlers and infected two other 
people 
some current and former employees at the lab believe a high 
turnover rate poor training and heavy workloads played a part in 
the outbreak of the rare disease which has been documented only 30 
times since the first case was reported in 1932 said dr gary 
holmes a cdc epidemiologist 
the disease which attacks the brain and central nervous system 
frequently leads to encephalitis an inflammation of the brain and 
then to death since the virus has been documented 16 of the 24 
patients who have shown symptoms have died holmes said in one case 
in pensacola the virus was spread persontoperson 
of about 135 blood tests conducted on current and former irdc lab 
employees who had contact with the monkeys in the last two months 
81 were negative and five were inconclusive michigan department of 
public health officials said the rest of the results are expected 
this week 
the company which employs 350 people does animal research for 
medical pharmaceutical veterinary and agricultural companies

a tanker carrying badly needed fuel broke 
through syrias blockade of the christian enclave sparking a fierce 
artillery duel that killed three people and wounded 16 police said 
saturday 
iraq syrias main arab rival said it was ready to cut off vital 
arms supplies to the christians to help arab league peace efforts 
there was no immediate reaction from christian leader gen michel 
aoun the army commander and head of a christian cabinet vying with 
a moslem cabinet to lead the government 
the official iraqi news agency in baghdad quoted a foreign 
ministry spokesman as warning the syrians not to take advantage 
of the iraqi move or commit any aggression against other parties 
in lebanon 
there was no immediate comment from syria 
the christians have relied heavily on the iraqi arms shipments 
including t54 tanks and multibarreled rocket launchers in their 
confrontation with the syrians and their moslem militia allies 
the arab league so far has failed to halt the fighting which 
began march 8 
the syrians and their allies imposed the land and sea blockade on 
the 310squaremile christian enclave on march 14 the blockade has 
caused a serious shortage of gasoline and oil and has turned the 
oncebustling area into a ghost town 
aouns cabinet has been buying gasoline abroad and shipping it to 
the christian enclave in small tankers syrian artillery pounds the 
christian coastline daily to stop the ships and one was hit and set 
ablaze a few weeks ago 
police declined to say how much fuel was aboard the ship that 
made it through saturday 
a christian source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
small tanker ventured through syrian shellfire friday night to 
anchor in a small bay about 15 miles north of beirut 
he said the tanker unloaded its cargo of gasoline and sailed out 
before dawn saturday he declined to identify the ship 
the syrians opened fire at the departing tanker aouns gunners 
fired back to provide the ship with cover the ship made it through 
the blockade and headed to cyprus but the exchange escalated and 
spread the source said 
a spokesman for aoun refused to comment on the fighting 
the casualties brought to 385 the number of people killed since 
the fighting began in march 1515 have been wounded 
a police spokesman said syrian forces were firing six shells and 
rockets a minute for some periods before dawn 
the barrage hit the ashrafiyeh and ein rummaneh districts of 
christian east beirut the coastline north of the capital and wooded 
valleys east of the waterfront where aouns artillery batteries are 
deployed the spokesman said 
he said aouns gunners retaliated with 155mm howitzer fire on 
syrian artillery emplacements along west beiruts seaside boulevard 
and the mountains overlooking the city 
the spokesman said the christian gunners scored several direct 
hits on syrian artillery emplacements in west beirut 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity reported seeing a 
syrian army ambulance rushing to scene shortly before dawn 
syrian headquarters in beirut refused comment 
as the firing intensified around daybreak families rushed for 
cover in underground shelters and basements 
the barrage eased about 8 am and police said hundreds of 
families left west beirut for safer areas in southern lebanon and

neighbors of the uranium processing plant in 
fernald said they were pleased with the governments proposal to pay 
a 73 million settlement in a lawsuit charging the plant polluted 
the environment 
but leaders of the fernald residents for environmental safety and 
health said friday that the plants owner the us department of 
energy must still be watched to ensure it continues to clean up the 
1050acre site 
were not done yet said lisa crawford spokeswoman for the 
citizens group it took us 4 years to win this battle this is 
just the first part the next step is to get it cleaned up 
terms of the settlement approved by energy secretary james d 
watkins late friday will be the subject of a hearing scheduled aug 
24 before us district judge s arthur spiegel in cincinnati it 
calls for the government to pay at least 73 million and no more 
than 78 million 
mrs crawford who lives two miles from the plant said the 
settlement provides funds for medical monitoring of the residents 
and their children to track any adverse effects of radioactive 
pollution 
for all of us its very important to have medical monitoring 
after all that weve been put through she said the biggest 
thing is that weve shown the world that the doe is wrong that what 
they did to these people was wrong 
stanley m chesley the lawyer who negotiated the settlement for 
the neighbors said money is also included for studies to analyze 
the extent of cancer in the area and help residents detect it as 
early as possible 
early detection is early cure in cancer chesley said now 
we can afford an opportunity for everyone to have early detection 
chesley filed a 300 million classaction lawsuit in spiegels 
court on behalf of 14000 people living within five miles of the 
38yearold plant where the government processed uranium used in 
making nuclear weapons 
the residents alleged in their suit that pollution from the plant 
18 miles northwest of cincinnati caused them mental stress and 
devalued their property 
spiegel presided over an unusual mock trial that ended june 15 
when a jurys nonbinding verdict recommended the residents be 
awarded 136 million chesley credited the mock trial for 
encouraging the settlement 
the defendant in the case was national lead of ohio the 
contractor that operated the plant for the government from 1951 
through 1985 the current operator westinghouse materials co was 
not involved in the suit 
chesley said the settlement is significant because it kills the 
energy department claim that national lead of ohio was not liable in 
the case because it took its actions on orders from the us 
government 
under the contract the government was required to pay damages 
assessed against nlo said energy department lawyer henry gill jr 
the energy department has admitted that the plant has released 
more than 300000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the 
atmosphere through faulty exhaustair filters during its history 
but the department denies that pollution from the plant has hurt 
neighbors property values 
a lot of that is hysteria said deputy energy secretary 
henson moore there really wasnt judging by what i heard a 
lot of hard evidence of anybody losing anything as a matter of 
fact almost none 
if spiegel approves the settlement the government must deposit 
the money into four cincinnati banks no later than oct 15 said 
louise roselle one of the lawyers who represented the neighbors

traveling shows featuring dwarftossing contests 
are the latest outrage dwarfs find themselves fighting to preserve 
their dignity and safety officials of the little people of america 
inc said saturday 
dwarftossing may help financially the person who does it 
however it tears down the structure and the esteem that little 
people are trying to gain said association spokesman ernie ott 
florida gov bob martinez signed a state law last week banning 
the barroom sport helping shortstatured people fight a lingering 
perception that they are nonpersons angela van etten a member 
of the committee to ban dwarf tossing said at the associations 
annual conference 
it occurs in a bar and a consenting adult little person allows 
a stranger in the bar to pick him up and see how far he can throw 
him the persons in the bar get prize money for throwing him the 
farthest ms van etten said 
the people in the bar all stand around laughing and think 
this is one huge joke she said 
dwarf tossing and dwarfbowling in which a helmeted dwarf 
strapped to a skatebard is used as a human bowling ball have been 
made part of traveling entertainment shows and have been reported in 
south carolina north carolina new jersey and new york she said 
efforts to outlaw the practice in several states are under way 
the association also issued a statement opposing the use of 
bonelengthening surgery to make dwarfed children taller the 
association said bungled surgery has crippled patients and forced 
amputations 
a record 1000 dwarfed people and their families were expected at 
the conference that began saturday to attend clinics on medical 
treatments watch a dwarf fashion show compete athletically and 
dance nearly every night of the week 
during the year you go dancing with your husband and youre 
the only little person on the floor you end up with a jab to the 
right and a jab to the left as well as curious stares said 
conference cochairwoman dee miller so dancing is very important 
to us 
kristen pohlman 17 said dwarfs travel across the country to 
attend the conference because it is their only chance to socialize 
with others who understand and accept them 
its a dream world its a real shock when you get back home 
said miss pohlman who believes she is the only dwarf in panama 
city fla 
its hell sometimes once a kid in a toy store came up to me 
and said oh you can talk she went up to her dad and said 
daddy buy me one of those she said 
the association was founded in 1957 by entertainer billy barty 
an actor who recently was featured in the movies willow and 
legend the organization bills itself as the largest national 
organization representing people of short stature 
most dwarfism is genetic but it usually does not strike all 
members of a family and it can be caused by more than 100 
disorders ott said

the 5608ton west germanflagged seacrest pioneer which came 
from bombay india was earlier reported by west germanys zdf 
television network to be carrying thionyl chloride a component used 
in manufacturing deadly mustard gas 
dubai is a major transshipment point for iranbound cargo 
zdf said the ship would be stopped before reaching iran quoting 
unidentified government sources in bonn but shipping executives 
reported no moves to seize the freighters cargo in dubai 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus saturday denied that a 
shipment of chemicals to manufacture chemical weapons was bound for 
iran it said the reports were perpetrated by the united states and 
indicated renewed american hostility toward the islamic republic 
west german prosecutors announced saturday they opened a criminal 
investigation into the rheineisen chemical products co of 
dusseldorf which reportedly contracted to deliver 257 tons of 
thionyl chloride to iran the firm is run by an iranian family 
the shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the seacrest pioneer discharged containers at hamriya the 
smallest of dubais three ports they said that at dusk the vessel 
would be reloaded with a new unidentified cargo and would prepare to 
sail back to bombay 
they described the new cargo as normal containers but said 
they could not identify the goods being loaded 
the discharged containers were stacked at the port without any 
apparent restrictions one source said on condition of anonymity 
the unloading and loading operations went smoothly to all 
appearances 
the source also said port officials told him they had received no 
orders from the government to confiscate any of the cargo 
the seacrest pioneer docks in dubai about once every two weeks on 
regular runs across the indian ocean 
rheineisen chemical products officials said earlier they halted 
the alleged shipment of thionyl chloride that arrived in bombay on 
wednesday they deny any wrongdoing and say they have government 
approval for the shipment to india 
the new york times saturday quoted an indian government official 
as saying the new delhi governments state trading corp sold iran 
60 tons of thionyl chloride in march 
the official was quoted as saying the chemical was shipped from 
bombay he said the sale did not violate indian laws because the 
chemical is a freely traded commodity often used in pesticides but 
is also a component of socalled mustard gas which is used in 
warfare because of its irritating blistering and disabling effects 
the reports follow an international uproar six months ago over 
the involvement of west german companies in building a factory 
outside tripoli libya washington said the factory would be used to 
make poison gas but libya said the plant will produce

protest liberalization of their austere order ended the standoff 
saturday a diocesan spokesman said 
the fourth woman whose temporary vows expired earlier in the 
year remained in the infirmary at the monastery of the most blessed 
virgin mary of mount carmel said timothy manning of the paterson 
diocese 
five of the 13 carmelite nuns at the monastery barricaded 
themselves in the infirmary oct 4 saying they feared eviction for 
protesting a new prioress introduction of television and sweets 
manning said saturdays action was a surprise were presuming 
that the realization finally hit them that if they wanted to save 
their vows they were going to have to leave 
manning said the diocese had planned to deliver an order monday 
demanding the nuns leave the monastery 
the nuns had maintained they would not leave the building until 
they were ordered to by the apostolica signatura the highest court 
of the vatican 
the nuns have twice ignored orders from lowerlevel vatican 
officials 
lynn williams formerly sister teresita was the only nun 
remaining at the infirmary saturday she hung up the telephone when 
reached by a reporter seeking comment there was no answer at the 
main monastery number 
the location of the other nuns was not known manning said 
betty sutton a lay person who has acted as a spokeswoman for the 
nuns said she did not know where they went 
this came as a total surprise to me ms sutton said i 
didnt know they were leaving 
she said she spoke to the rebel nuns two days ago and they said 
they were frustrated the case had dragged on so long the remaining 
nun had shared that attitude ms sutton said 
i cant imagine what theyre thinking she said unless 
their parents influenced them but thats just a supposition 
ms sutton said she had spoken with sister eliane who lives in 
the monastery and has been a spokeswoman for the nuns 
its very disturbing she said we just dont understand 
how this happened so quickly 
sister eliane said in an interview last week that she believed 
the nuns would remain until the apostolica delivered its ruling i 
dont see any movement or anything that theyre leaving she said 
the last vatican letter received may 31 told two of the nuns to 
seek another monastery informed one that her temporary vows had 
expired and allowed a 71yearold nun to stay on the condition that 
she obey the monastery prioress

police clashed with residents 
holding a community meeting in the black homeland of bophuthatswana 
on saturday and nine officers and two civilians were killed local 
news reports said 
officers in the town of leeufontein 150 miles northwest of 
johannesburg were investigating an alleged illegal gathering when 
they were attacked by a large crowd of people with petrol bombs 
axes and stones the south african press association quoted police 
officials as saying 
in an earlier report the press association said the deaths 
occurred when police fired on the meeting with automatic rifles and 
people at the meeting retaliated 
clashes between local citizens and police have been reported in 
leeuwfontein and nearby braklaagte since they were incorporated into 
bophuthatswana last year in march police in braklaagte were 
accused of beating people who refused to declare themselves citizens 
of bophuthatswana 
critics say such boundary changes in south africa have deprived 
thousands of people of south african citizenship and the job 
opportunities and other advantages that go with it 
police col da george was quoted by the press association as 
saying he was unsure what the meeting in leeuwfontein was about but 
that it probably concerned the incorporation issue 
george said that in the unprovoked attack four officers were 
trapped in a police vehicle and burned to death and five others were 
killed by stones and axes the two civilians were killed by police 
gunfire when the officers tried to defend themselves he said in a 
statement 
george said an unspecified number of arrests were made and police 
were patrolling the area on foot and in helicopters 
a spokesman for the transvaal rural action committee quoted a 
community leader dadelik majasa as saying police opened fire 
during the meeting killing two or three civilians and that four or 
five officers were killed when the crowd retaliated 
some of leeuwfonteins 1500 people have gone to court to contest 
the incorporation on grounds it was done without prior notice a 
similar legal appeal by braklaagte involving 9000 rural blacks was 
rejected by a regional court in march 
bophuthatswana is one of several tribal areas within south africa 
that the whitecontrolled government has encouraged to become 
nominally independent a strategy that in effect helps control the 
size of the countrys 28 million blacks however the homelands are 
not recognized internationally as separate countries 
bophuthatswana located in the northcentral part of the country 
has an estimated 17 million people

president bush back at his beloved 
vacation home for an extended holiday weekend spent a vigorous 
saturday recreating by the sea entertaining family and encouraging 
neighbors to watch his fireworks show monday night 
beautiful day he called out cheerily to neighbors out 
walking their dogs when he took his 630 am jog on dirt roads near 
his family compound at walkers point 
the president was accompanied on the run by daughter dorothy 
leblond first dog millie a couple of secret services agents and a 
reporter 
he advised the neighbors he jogged past not to miss a fireworks 
display to be set off on monday night over walkers point site of 
the bush home 
the presidents fiveday stay was billed as a mostly private time 
for recreation but he said he would be going over briefing 
materials for the upcoming european summit 
bush was accompanied on the sunny holiday weekend by wife 
barbara some of his young grandchildren and other relatives 
after his twomile jog bush headed for the sauna and pool and 
his daily intelligence briefing on world events 
he then took his boat fidelity out on the sea whizzing by the 
shawmut hotel just as white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
finished telling reporters the president would have no other public 
activities for the day 
however bush later played golf at cape arundel golf course with 
longtime friend spike heminway and club pro ken raynor as they teed 
off bush wearing carnary yellow pants was asked by reporters if 
he was getting tired from the days activities 
what do you mean he asked laughing were just beginning 
a fiveday marathon 
bush played 18 holes in less than two hours and credited his 
improved game to a new type of putter 
fitzwater said there has been no resolution of the flap over who 
will pay an estimated 40000 per year that local police must spend 
to accommodate the presidential visits 
bush has been visiting kennebunkport since his boyhood but new 
security demands since he has become president have prompted 
complaints from local authorities and a letter from sen george 
mitchell dmaine seeking federal financial help 
fitzwater said the president wants to help and feels very 
strongly for kennebunkport but there is no legal way to spend 
federal funds to help the local governments 
it would take an act of congress that would allow us to give 
money for that said fitzwater adding that he was unaware of any 
special federal help provided other small towns that have served as 
presidential vacation spots in past administrations 
meanwhile crowds of tourists crowding the quaint 
boutiquefilled center of town appeared to be oblivious to the 
presidents visit 
one of the unsolved mysteries this weekend in kennebunkport is 
the identity of the mysterious benefactor paying for what promises 
to be a spectacular fireworks show monday night 
the show will be produced by pyrotechnics specialist george 
zambelli who counts the president among his fans 
the state fire marshalls office said the permit was issued in 
bushs name at the request of the secret service but no one is 
saying who will pick up the tab estimated at 5000 
fitzwater said only that it is an anonymous donor

sudans new military leader on saturday 
pledged to end the 6yearold civil war peacefully promising to 
make contacts with rebels fighting the moslemdominated government 
twentyeight army generals were fired 
our primary goal is peace and we the army are the people 
mostly suffering from war brig gen omar hassan ahmed elbashir 
told a government meeting broadcast on official radio i will 
enlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace 
elbashir said the peace overtures begun last month by prime 
minister sadek elmahdi whom he toppled friday were political 
machinations and not serious 
the war with the mainly christian and animist rebels in the south 
has crippled the economy and led to widespread famine that has 
claimed hundreds of thousands of lives 
elbashir led 15 military officers in the bloodless coup the 
fourth military takeover in sudans 33 years of independence the 
junta known as the national salvation council imposed a state of 
emergency suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament 
political parties and unions 
hundreds of troops guarded the streets on saturday stopping and 
searching cars and manning barricades tanks and armored cars 
guarded the presidential palace army headquarters and bridges 
spanning the white nile and blue nile that bisect the city 
telex and telephone communications with khartoum cut immediately 
after the coup were restored however reporters wanting to send 
stories by telex were ordered to submit their copy for 
verification by officials 
the new regime also imposed an indefinite ban on traveling 
abroad the move was believed aimed at curbing the spending of badly 
needed hard currency 
khartoum airport reopened for eight hours saturday for planes 
carrying moslem pilgrims to saudi arabia for the annual pilgrimage 
but it was closed to other international traffic 
egypt on saturday became the first country to recognize the new 
regime relations were strained during most of elmahdis three 
years in power elmahdi had accused egypt of meddling in sudans 
internal affairs by giving shelter to gaafar nimeiri the president 
ousted in 1985 and approving nimeiris political activities in 
cairo 
in neighboring chad the official radio on saturday welcomed the 
military coup saying it was for the greatest good of sudan and 
the sudanese people 
elbashir 44 consolidated his power on saturday by sacking 28 
army generals including gen fathi ahmed ali the commander in 
chief and gen babu nimir the chief of staff and a reputed 
elmahdi supporter 
the junta promoted elbashir from brigidier to lieutenant 
general he earlier named himself prime minister defense minister 
and armed forces commander 
sources close to the junta said the army detained dozens of 
political figures after the coup but there were conflicting reports 
about elmahdis whereabouts egypts middle east news agency 
reported saturday that elmahdi was in custody 
the sources did not verify that report but said the army is 
holding hassan alturabi head of the fundamentalist national 
islamic front idris albanna a member of the disbanded state 
council and mohammed ibrahim nugud secretary general of the 
communist party 
at the meeting elbashir put government undersecretaries in 
charge of ministries pending appointment of a new cabinet 
he said he would scrap the peace process begun by elmahdi and 
launch his own peace strategy but he gave no details 
in may elmahdi opened peace talks with representatives of the 
sudan peoples liberation army led by former army col john garang 
the leader of the antigovernment rebellion the rebels demand more 
autonomy from the mainly moslem northernercontrolled government 
one rebel demand was the permanent removal of harsh islamic laws 
introduced by nimeiri and suspended by mahdi earlier this year 
talks were to have been resumed tuesday in addis ababa ethiopia 
but the junta on saturday indefinitely banned all official missions 
abroad 
the talks were based on a tentative peace accord concluded in 
november and later endorsed by elmahdi under pressure from the army 
and the unions 
rebel leaders have not commented on elbashirs coup 
also saturday the junta released more than two dozen officers 
whom elmahdis government arrested two weeks ago and accused of 
plotting a coup 
elmahdis civilian government took power in 1986 replacing a 
transitional military government that had been in place since the 
1985 coup that ousted nimeiri 
nimeiri last month said he would return from exile in cairo and 
regain power elbashir said in a statement on friday that his coup 
had nothing to do with nimeiri

conservative and communist parties ended a 
twoweek political deadlock saturday and agreed to form a coalition 
government it was the first time communists have played a role in 
determining the formation of greeces government 
it appeared however that the coalition would govern only three 
months and that its sole task would be to clean up greeces 
scandalridden political system 
the decision by the communistdominated coalition of the left and 
progress to join with the conservative new democracy party gave that 
partys premierdesignate tzannis tzannetakis the support needed 
for a majority in the 300member parliament 
president christos sartzetakis announced that tzannetakis a new 
democracy parliamentarian since 1977 would be sworn in sunday 
in the june 18 general election new democracy won 145 seats the 
coalition an alliance of the greek communist party disenchanted 
socialists and the eurocommunist greek left won 28 places 
premier andreas papandreous panhellenic socialist movement or 
pasok lost after eight years in power taking only 125 seats 
late saturday night the 62yearold tzannetakis announced the 
first of his cabinet posts only two of those he appointed the 
justice and interior ministers were nonparliamentarians 
affiliated with the leftist coalition most others were from the new 
democracy party 
named as deputy foreign minister was george papoulias currently 
the envoy in washington 
in negotiations leading up to the agreement new democracy leader 
constantine mitsotakis had offered the coalition the justice and 
interior ministries 
the agreement came 40 years after the communists in their bid to 
seize power were defeated in a civil war by usbacked government 
troops 
papandreou 70 who was in a hospital for treatment of a heart 
and kidney condition reacted bitterly to the pact between the two 
political forces 
this alliance is without principles it violates the popular 
will he said 
papandreou had called on the coalition to join pasok so the two 
parties could set up a government but coalition leader harilaos 
florakis said he didnt want to be associated with a scandaltainted 
group like the socialists 
a multimilliondollar scandal allegedly involving key ministers 
in papandreous government and his open affair with a woman half 
his age while he was married contributed to papandreous downfall 
mitsotakis and florakis agreed that their coalition would have a 
threemonth life span and that its work would be limited to 
restoring democratic institutions and cleaning up greek politics 
florakis said at the end of the three months we will 
reexamine our position and act accordingly 
but because of the wide gap in the two sides political 
ideologies it appeared unlikely the coalition could survive after 
its task of purging former pasok ministers and officials accused of 
involvement in scandals 
if the coalition falls apart the president will appoint a 
caretaker regime to lead the country to natonal elections 
a newly elected government is needed to deal with pressing 
economic problems and complete negotiations with the united states 
over the future of its four major military bases in greece the 
defense pact expired last december but a clause gives the united 
states 17 months to either close down the bases or renegotiate a new 
agreement 
the two members of the new coalition differ over the presence of 
the us bases the coalition has strongly opposed the four bases 
and called for their removal but the new democracy party favors 
negotiating a new agreement

a former exxon computer operator said he 
accidentally erased computer copies of thousands of documents on the 
alaskan oil spill according to the new york times 
an exxon spokesman confirmed the destruction but said company 
lawyers believe other copies exist either on paper or in other 
computer files the newspaper said in sunday editions 
computer operator kenneth a davis who worked at exxons houston 
office told the times it would be difficult and possibly impossible 
to determine which documents were destroyed 
davis 33 was fired june 8 the day after the destruction was 
detected he told the times his superiors had been negligent in 
safeguarding the records and said he contacted the newspaper 
because they are making me the scapegoat 
however davis said i have no reason to believe that anyone at 
exxon wanted these records to be destroyed 
exxon has been under a federal court order to preserve the 
computer records and all other material concerning the march 24 
shipwreck oil spill and cleanup in prince william sound at nearly 
11 million gallons it was the nations worst oil spill 
exxon spokesman les rogers said the company instructed employees 
to preserve documents even before the court order though no checks 
had been made to see if employees complied 
rogers said no search had been conducted to determine which files 
were destroyed when a court determines what documents are needed 
and appropriate they will be produced he said 
the material destroyed included all internal communications from 
the exxon shipping co owner of the tanker exxon valdez and exxon 
usas executive offices the times said 
as is their routine davis and other technicians spent three 
nights reusing monthold computer tapes not realizing they were 
valdezrelated he said davis said the tapes were not dated or 
marked do not destroy as they should have been and should have 
been stored elsewhere 
stephen d sussman a lawyer representing fishermen alaska 
natives and others in a lawsuit against exxon said the incident 
means exxon may have been negligent even in the handling of its 
own documents 
alaska attorney general douglas bailey said that if these 
records have disappeared it will be a substantial loss to any 
effort to reconstruct what actually happened

also saturday israel television reported that israeli embassies 
have been ordered to refuse to accept information from the united 
states and other nations concerning their talks with the plo

public transportation ground to a halt for the second consecutive 
day as palestinians observed a commercial strike to protest israels 
deportation of eight arabs 
in the strips jabaliya refugee camp arab reports said troops 
opened fire on a group of mourners visiting the family of mohammed 
abu alnasr a palestinian who kidnapped american relief worker 
chris george last week 
george was released unharmed after almost 30 hours of captivity 
the army said alnasr was gunned down last wednesday by troops after 
he hijacked an arab taxi 
arab reports said troops on saturday shot tear gas and later live 
ammunition after dozens of mourners standing outside alnasrs home 
began throwing stones at soldiers 
the reports said at least six palestinians were wounded in the 
incident including alnasrs 60yearold uncle hassan abu alnasr 
arab hospital officials said three other palestinians from 
jabaliya were wounded saturday but could not say whether the

refused to confirm or deny the reports but said embassies have 
standing orders not to receive such information

a huge cargo plane 
that arose from the antarctic ice like a frozen phoenix after being 
buried in drifts for 16 years returned to its home base saturday 
today we are celebrating a triumph a triumph of technology a 
triumph of knowledge and skill and a triumph of courage national 
science foundation spokesman jack talmadge said after the lc130 
hercules and its ninemember crew landed 
lockheed engineers and navy personnel worked in subfreezing cold 
heavy snow and windstorms for 42 days to excavate the icebound 
40ton aircraft the 98footlong plane was flown out of the crash 
site in january 1988 and was renovated in christchurch new zealand 
the lc130 returned to its hangar at the navys antarctic 
development squadron 6 the puckered penguins who fly seven 
cargo ships owned by the foundation and used to supply its polar 
missions 
the hercules was abandoned in december 1971 at a remote site 
about 700 miles from mcmurdo sound the us ice station on the 
antarctic after an aborted takeoff that damaged its landing ski and 
nose 
the aircraft was designed for use in polar climates and has 
oneton tefloncoated wheelskis to break the grip of ice on 
takeoff 
the loss of the hercules hurt the foundations ability to conduct 
field research in antarctica foundation officials have said 
a salvage crew worked in minus 30degree temperatures heavy snow 
and 20knot windstorms to excavate the damaged aircraft repair it 
and fly it out all but the top 3 feet of the planes 38foothigh 
tail had been buried in snow 
the plane was made by lockheed aeronautical systems co in 
marietta ga lockheed engineers involved in the salvage found many 
hydraulic and electronics systems still working after the long 
hibernation 
there was still air in the tires and gasoline in the tanks 
apparently preserved by the frigid temperatures and dry polar 
climate 
foundation officials say about 42 million was spent to excavate 
and overhaul the plane the estimated cost of a replacement plane is 
35 million

at least three of the four people killed in the 
worst atlanta fire in nine years would probably have lived if 
sprinklers had been required in the 27yearold office building the 
citys top fire official said saturday 
in this instance i guarantee you there wouldnt have been four 
deaths if sprinklers had been in there said acting fire chief tom 
perrin 
the 10story peachtree 25th building which housed 1200 office 
workers including those from six federal agencies was built in 1962 
12 years before city codes required sprinkler systems in new 
buildings taller than eight stories perrin said 
no laws were passed to force the owners of older buildings to 
install the sprinklers he said 
building owners say it costs too much but how much are these 
four lives going to cost perrin said you know there are going 
to be lawsuits filed in a fire like this 
a series of powerful electrical explosions apparently set off 
when an electrical worker was changing a fuse triggered the blaze at 
1030 am friday much of the building was evacuated quickly but a 
number of workers were trapped and broke out windows to escape 
choking plumes of smoke 
they were rescued by firefighters using ladders but one woman 
20yearold cassandra hayward leaped from a sixthfloor window to 
escape the fire she suffered broken legs a broken ankle and hand 
injuries and was in critical but stable condition saturday at 
piedmont hospital seven others remained hospitalized saturday one 
in critical condition 
sgt steve martin with the fulton county medical examiners 
office identified two of the dead as clifton c chandler 29 of 
decatur a graphic artist with an office in the building and victor 
tinubu 36 of atlanta martin said tinubus reason for being in the 
building was not immediately known 
sgt richard eskew of the medical examiners office said 
autopsies revealed all four victims died of smoke inhalation with 
the electrician also suffering severe burns 
investigators were puzzled about the identity of the woman eskew 
said no one had even telephoned authorities with a missing person 
report and she apparently did not work in the building 
it was the worst atlanta fire since 1980 when five people 
including four children were killed in an explosion at a daycare 
center 
although thick smoke rather than flames was likely to blame for 
the deaths in fridays fire perrin said a sprinkler system would 
have certainly saved three people whose bodies were found some 
distance from the initial blast 
even the workman who was fatally injured by the explosion was 
able to stagger or crawl down a hall away from the fire and might 
have lived had a sprinkler system put out the blaze he said 
it might have even saved that fourth guy perrin said i 
feel like we probably wouldnt have had any deaths if wed had the 
sprinkler system 
fire officials were focusing their investigation saturday on 
whether extensive electrical work being done in the building played 
a role in the fire and whether some of that work violated city codes 
perrin said an electrical contractor received a city permit in 
may to renovate the first floor but fire investigators found 
evidence of largescale work on the sixth and other floors 
there were ladders in there and they had heavy conduit pulled 
out he said such work without a permit would be a violation 
he said 
the building is managed by american management co of the los 
angeles suburb of torrance harry komsky vice president of the 
company said an investigation would begin into the fire but he 
would not comment on the lack of sprinklers 
komsky said the company is shocked beyond words at the loss of 
life and the injuries 
six federal agencies have offices in the building located north 
of midtown atlanta including the department of agriculture 
department of the treasury department of health and human services 
and the national transportation safety board 
none of those offices is on the sixth floor where the damage was 
the worst and where the people were trapped perrin said 
perrin said he hoped the fire would result in legislation 
requiring sprinkler systems in all buildings beyond a certain 
height regardless of their ages he said he planned to send 
information about the blaze to congressmen interested in fire safety 
issues 
there were reports by some agencies friday that a fifth person 
had died in the fire but martin said that stemmed from confusion 
over the unrelated death of a construction worker who fell from a 
construction site a few miles away at about the same time as the 
fire

about 80 japanese monkeys were on the 
loose saturday after escaping from their compound at a safari park 
and some were sighted across the border in new york state zoo 
officials said 
officials discovered the monkeys had escaped thursday morning 
said danny kyle an owner of parc safari about 56 miles southeast 
of montreal 
apparently they managed to find or create a faulty hinge on the 
door to the compound where they were housed kyle said in a 
telephone interview 
most of them on saturday were in a large wooded area surrounding 
the reserve but 10 or 12 broke away from the group and made it over 
the border to the united states 
some were seen by local residents and state troopers at perrys 
mills ny a town three miles south of the park 
the small primates called snow monkeys come from the mountains 
of japan and weigh between 15 and 20 pounds the animals are 
mischievous but not dangerous said kyle 
park employees formed a human chain to try to force the monkeys 
back into the reserve and stop them from reaching the border about a 
mile away they also tried to entice them back into the compound 
by means of apples oranges and bananas kyle said but the attempt 
was unsuccessful 
apparently they got lost or separated said kyle 
the group includes males females and babies he said they 
tend to stick together in groups led by one dominant male they 
were all born in captivity so thats in our favor too they are not 
used to having to look for food themselves

a man whose antiwar bomb shattered a 
fivestory campus building said he regrets the 1970 blast killed 
someone but still feels he was right to protest the vietnam war 
david s fine a university of wisconsin student at the time was 
among veterans of the 1960s protest movement who gathered this 
weekend for a reunion 
he and three other men were put on the fbis list of mostwanted 
fugitives after their homemade bomb damaged a campus building 
killing a student and injuring several other people on aug 24 
1970 several other people were injured 
fine karleton armstrong and his brother dwight armstrong were 
eventually arrested and received prison sentences leo burt 
identified as the fourth participant was never captured 
the building had formerly housed the army mathematics research 
center and was frequently a target of campus antiwar demonstrations 
fine and other participants denied intending to harm anyone 
regardless of why the bombing happened and the feelings people 
had about the center and the war in vietnam that in no way 
justifies the death and destruction fine said in an interview 
published saturday 
so i have a lot of regrets about that always have always 
will im sure he said 
weekend events included discussion groups with topics ranging 
from women in the 1990s to the decline and fall of civil rights 
fine 37 who works in a law office in portland ore said he 
worried about what kind of reception he would get in madison 
im not going to come back and attempt to justify things i was 
convicted of which were very tragic he said 
i probably wouldnt contemplate doing something like that now 
under the same circumstances karleton armstrong said but for 
where i was at and where people were at the time i thought it was 
right 
the madison native said he had no plans to attend the reunion but 
would be on the campus selling fruit juice from a stand he has 
operated for several years 
dwight armtstrong is in prison in indiana on a drug charge 
madison fbi agent john frazer said burt was dropped from the 
mostwanted list years ago but remains a federal fugitive asked if 
authorities would watch for burt during the reunion university 
security chief ralph hanson said im looking for him i dont 
expect him to show up

striking united mine workers members blocked 
coal trucks and damaged two vehicles friday in an attempt to halt 
shipments by nonunion coal companies authorities said 
gov gaston caperton said he had not heard from the pittston co 
parent company of pittston coal group about his latest offer to let 
the umw and pittston use his home or office for negotiations to 
settle the strike 
they have obviously decided they dont want to respond 
affirmatively to the letter i sent caperton said declining 
further comment 
caperton twice in the past week has invited the two sides to meet 
in charleston and settle the strike the umw has accepted both times 
and pittston now has rejected both offers 
after a closed meeting of about 1000 umw members in logan on 
friday morning about 150 miners drove to kenova where they blocked 
trucks trying to leave a nonunion coalloading terminal on the big 
sandy river 
many miners wore bandanas over their faces despite state law that 
prohibits west virginians from covering their faces in public state 
troopers showed up but made no arrests warning to the miners of 
heavy traffic on us 52 
about 1900 umw members are on strike against pittston in 
kentucky virginia and west virginia and their strike that began 
april 5 has spawned wildcat walkouts by at least 37000 miners in 
eight states 
in alabama on friday bullets apparently were fired at a coal 
barge and a coal truck in walker county a coal barge moving along 
the warrior river near cordova reportedly was fired on and a truck 
received gunshot damage while parked near jasper sheriffs deputies 
said no one was injured 
in west virginia four men who identified themselves as 
furloughed miners were arrested thursday night after power was cut 
to the new elk mining co mine near horse creek while miners worked 
inside state police said friday 
federal charges of cutting power to an operating mine were 
pending troopers said 
on friday 300 members of the oil chemical and atomic workers 
union walked off the job at an alloy metals plant for half an hour 
in support of the pittston strikers 
it was the first walkout by another union in support of the umw 
in this strike members of the united steelworkers in pennsylvania 
have refused to cross umw picket lines however 
and with an eye to shootings and rockthrowing incidents that 
have marred the strikes in recent days umw officials in pikeville 
ky banned strikers from setting off fireworks on the picket lines 
over the fourth of july weekend 
just to preserve our image that this is a peaceful picket it 
would be in our best interest not to have any fireworks on the 
picket line said glenn stanley president of umw local 5737 
the sounds could be confusing 
the pittston strike began peacefully but there has been 
scattered violence since the wildcat strikes began including some 
shootings in west virginia and alabama

jim dial the rigid humorless anchorman on 
cbs murphy brown is really a romantic at heart 
the public side that hes developed is armorplated says 
charles kimbrough who ought to know he plays the coanchor on the 
shows fictional tv newsmagazine fyi which also features 
murphy brown candice bergen frank fontana joe regalbuto and 
corky sherwood faith ford 
inside hes a dreamer he probably grew up reading richard 
halliburtons travel adventures and wanting to be just like edward 
r murrow he seems older because his values are those of an older 
time it makes him uncomfortable to have to share the show with a 
former beauty queen like corky sherwood 
he seems gruff with no sense of humor but he can loosen up 
with his friends the comedy comes from the fact that hes such 
a stiff i have a fondness for that part of him thats loving and 
vulnerable 
the thing kimbrough says he dreads most is the comparison of dial 
to ted baxter on the mary tyler moore show 
jims a good journalist ted baxter was a very bad journalist 
jims a smart guy ted was pretty dumb 
the role is the first real television exposure for kimbrough he 
has spent most of his acting career on the stage in regional and 
repertory companies and got his big break with his broadway 
debut in copout he also was in company and sunday in the 
park with george 
i was mostly working in the theater and making money doing 
commercials id occasionally do a movie or a part on television 
when i was asked to do an audition tape for murphy brown i figured 
it was just a ticket to oblivion you sit in front of a camera and 
they put a bright light in your face 
i loved the script and i wanted to do it after the audition 
tape i walked in the rain feeling very depressed three weeks later 
they asked me to fly to los angeles i found out i was competing 
against one of my best friends they put us up in the same hotel and 
we laughed about it we both wanted it a lot i flew back to new 
york and was doing a commercial on location in long island when they 
called and said i had the part 
kimbrough grew up in the chicago area where his only early 
connection with the theater was an aunt emily kimbrough who with 
cornelia otis skinner wrote our hearts were young and gay the 
book about two young women traveling in europe was adapted for the 
stage and was made into a movie in 1944 
i grew up listening to music and doing a lot of drawing and 
painting i went to indiana university and ive never told this to 
anyone because they had a great opera department i thought it 
would be wonderful to go to a school where i could go to the opera 
on saturday night 
i tried out for a school play and got a part my grade average 
went from a b to a c overnight because i was closing the 
pizzeria every night with people who liked what i liked 
i was in a lot of plays but it was too scary to call myself an 
actor when i went to the yale drama school i took directing 
instead but i spent most of my time acting 
kimbrough met his wife mary jane wilson at yale after 
graduating they landed roles in all in love a musical 
adaptation of richard sheridans the rivals i was making 
equity scale and taking home 3732 jane was nonequity and took 
home 10 a week they paid us in cash so it seemed like more after 
that we got out of the business for a while 
wilson taught college and kimbrough worked at a record club but 
they both returned to the stage in the chicago version of a julius 
monk revue that was followed by three years with the hartford stage 
co and six in milwaukee 
despite directing classes at yale kimbrough says he hasnt spent 
much time in that capacity i directed a few plays but i hated to 
be the unpopular one in the company if you tell an actor what to do 
id always worry about it

while millions of americans twirl sparklers set off firecrackers 
and ooh and aah over fourth of july fireworks displays us 
importers are getting headaches worrying about future festivities 
there certainly is considerable concern for the 1990 season 
says john conkling executive director of the american pyrotechnics 
association everybody is awaiting word from factories in china 
about the status of future deliveries 
so before the last wisp of smoke has cleared on july 4 many 
fireworks firms will have placed next years orders in anticipation 
of a possible shortage due to chinas precarious political and 
economic situation 
the chinese credited with inventing fireworks about 1000 years 
ago make the bulk more than 75 percent of the stuff us 
consumers use during independence day celebrations 
giving people such fleeting thrills as they get from lighting 
roman candles takes us companies months of planning negotiating 
and waiting for shipments even in the best of circumstances 
us fireworks firms normally have their overseas ordering done 
by the autumn of each year to allow enough time for foreign 
factories to manufacture and ship the goods early enough for 
distribution in the united states before july 
now however the uncertainty of chinese supplies has companies 
scrambling to keep from being caught short next fourth of july by 
far the biggest time of year for the fireworks business 
current supplies should be enough to satisfy this seasons 
demand most imported chinese fireworks had already arrived in the 
united states or left chinas shores before the beijing governments 
bloody crackdown on prodemocracy activists 
the shipments for this year started arriving in the united 
states back in november of 1988 observed john d rogers a 
fireworks expert at the consumer product safety commission so the 
majority of them were already here or on the water 
phil grucci a member of the family that runs one of the 
countrys biggest organizers of fireworks shows says intermediaries 
that handle his companys purchases abroad have advised grucci not 
to panic nonetheless the bellport nybased fireworks by grucci 
inc expects a slowdown in chinese production 
weve already placed our purchase orders to china now to try 
to beat the rush grucci said we usually dont make big orders 
until august or september to overseas 
firms like grucci that specialize in aerial displays dont rely 
on china as much as companies do that primarily provide fireworks 
for consumer use besides what it imports from china grucci 
supplements its own products with fireworks from numerous foreign 
sources including japan taiwan and other far eastern countries as 
well as ones in europe 
royce trout of atlas enterprises inc in fort worth texas a 
fireworks maker and importer that ships throughout the country says 
manufacturing in chinas northern provinces is more likely to be 
affected by political unrest than factories elsewhere in the country 
this is because most of the turmoil seems to have flared up 
around chinas economically developed areas and educational centers 
he says 
potential production snarls wont hit all types of fireworks 
factories assembling firecrackers a highly laborintensive task 
mainly are located in the more rural part of chinas southern 
provinces so firecracker shipments arent likely to be disrupted 
says trout 
adding to problems that might arise from developments on the 
political front trout says hes been informed that several chinese 
factories are facing financial trouble 
a lack of credit to cover material and other costs has put three 
or four factories in hunan province in danger of closing the 
southeastern province annually accounts for about 15 percent of 
chinas total fireworks shipments to the united states which came 
to more than 50 million pounds in 1987 the most recent year for 
which us government figures were available 
tightness in availability of one of atlas enterprises most 
popular items probably reflects these financial difficulties the 
item is a type of ground spinner a category of fireworks that 
china created that spews fiery blossoms as it gyrates on the 
ground ground spinners are tubes packed with a an assortment of 
fireworks producing multiple effects 
im very very worried about what kind of supply well get from 
some provinces both from a political standpoint and a financial 
standpoint says trout 
people in the fireworks business say there are only a few 
countries that could help fill a potential shortfall in chinese 
shipments and there are limits to how much places such as hong 
kong taiwan and macao the portugueseadministered territory off 
chinas southeastern coast could compensate 
conkling of the pyrotechnics trade group says fireworks are an 
important export for china 
the country was becoming a powerful force in fireworks just 
before former president richard nixon reopened trade with the 
country in the early 1970s it has come to dominate the industry 
today largely because its factories turn out products of acceptable 
quality at unbeatable prices due to low labor costs 
fireworks is a legitmate science in china universities do 
research into pyrotechnics and fireworks and this translates into 
big business for the country says conkling 
for years china has kept fireworks prices down very close to 
the cost of production to attract customers but us businesses 
say that even before the political problems they were told to expect 
price hikes of 15 percent to 30 percent for next seasons orders as 
the chinese try to eke out more profit 
us retail sales of fireworks will total about 200 million this 
year the industry says 
government figures indicate china supplies about 76 percent by 
weight of all fireworks brought into the united states but the 
industry says the figures probably understate chinese imports 
as chinas shipments have grown the quality has been slipping 
possibly because newer factories arent as familiar with us 
regulations all imported fireworks must meet the same safety 
standards as domestically made products 
trout who also is president of the industrys trade association 
says the group has been working on a sort of selfregulatory program 
to promote consistent quality partly to account for advances in 
fireworks since government regulations were written 
because of chinas trade dominance the us industry has been 
taking special care to see that the chinese know whats expected of 
them the industry is preparing an improved translation into chinese 
of all the requirements set down by several us agencies 
as part of the quality campaign us industry representatives 
had scheduled a trip to china in late july and early august now the 
campaign may have to be put on hold 
we are quite concerned at this point as to how the situation in 
china will affect our efforts to get this quality assurance program 
in place said conkling the meeting in china he says is very 
much up in the air at this point

recessions or economic downturns of the kind 
wall street is now worrying about have a terrible and welldeserved 
reputation but is there anything nice to be said about them 
lots they remove excesses like severe inventory pileups from the 
economy they remind sellers that the consumer is still boss they 
might even be accompanied by or cause lower prices and borrowing 
rates 
what they do best perhaps is remind both sellers and buyers 
that the old law of supply and demand is still on the books in boom 
times the seller usually has the upper hand in bad times the 
consumer ascends 
this pervasive impact may have shown up already in lower housing 
and stock prices and it could make even bigger inroads into the 
automobile market which for a year has been fighting its own 
private battle with a slowdown 
the automotive market in fact has been a display case of the 
strategies that come into play when the demandsupply balance is 
changing demand for cars has been ebbing for at least a year 
supply however has remained high 
under such conditions the suppliers must make concessions which 
they did in the form of rebates and belowmarket borrowing rates 
while the federal reserve attempted to ease the economy into a 
slower pace by raising borrowing rates the automakers sought to 
challenge them by lowering their own rates 
it was a battle the automakers were destined to lose because the 
fed had the ultimate power it had the option of raising rates until 
it won its way the automakers in contrast could lower their rates 
to zero but not beyond 
conceding defeat the automakers have sharply reduced production 
in an attempt to restore sellerbuyer balance scheduled output for 
july is at an annual rate of 5 million units or roughly half the 
annual selling rate 
the question now is whether the balance can be restored in time 
to avoid price cutting if demand remains low the possibility 
exists that companies may be unable to reduce inventories 
sufficiently before new models are announced if so more automobile 
bargains might be available consumers will have won 
over the past year housing has also demonstrated the power of 
supply and demand demand was down due to high prices and interest 
rates in response and despite a recent and probably temporary 
upturn prices stagnated or fell 
a housing market of that sort is a warning to makers of 
appliances furniture and other items associated with housing such 
as lawn products to lower their inventories or else be forced to 
lower their prices 
if a recession does develop and there is still no proof that one 
will there could other consumer benefits 
credit card issuers for example have clung to high interest 
rates some of them charging more than 20 percent preferring 
instead to attract customers through contests lowcost merchandise 
travel discounts and the like 
however such incentives lose their drawing power when people are 
in a recession mode waiting and watching their dollars the biggest 
incentive in such an atmosphere might be lower interest charges 
sellers of nonessential purchases might be forced to win 
customers through price cuts among them are airlines resorts 
hotels various entertainment outlets and restaurants all of which 
have been raising prices 
eating out for example already has suffered a hit as economist 
edward yardeni points out from 1982 to 1987 restaurant meal sales 
rose from 1129 billion a year to 1334 billion a year they 
peaked at a 139 billion rate in january of this year by may the 
rate was down 14 percent to 132 billion 
when restaurateurs see figures such as these they know what must 
be done cut prices true they have the option of dramatically 
improving the quality of food and service but in a recession price 
cuts are much better 
price cuts are nice but not the recession that produces them 
most people it seems safe to say without a survey would opt for 
expansion and pay raises instead 
that leads to the ultimate good thing to be said about a 
recession it is the base for the next expansion for more jobs 
higher pay and lots of spending options

investors have been pouring money into junkbond 
mutual funds in recent months as interest rates available elsewhere 
have fallen but they may be unaware of the danger lurking in these 
tempting highyield investments 
many people hear the word bonds and they think safe 
conservative said neal litvack of fidelity investments operator 
of one of the largest junkbond funds junk bonds have a tendency 
to dance to a different drummer 
that drummer is the state of the economy unlike investmentgrade 
corporate bonds junk bonds face a greater danger of plummeting in 
price in a recession 
junk bonds are bonds that carry a low credit rating as determined 
by creditrating agencies their low rating reflects the fact that 
the companies that issued the bonds may be deep in debt or otherwise 
poor credit risks 
junk bonds also are used to raise cash for many leveraged 
takeovers where the corporate raider takes on a great deal of debt 
in order to pay for the target company 
in contrast investmentgrade corporate bonds are considered a 
conservative safe investment because the issuing company is rated 
financially sound and considered able to meet its debt obligations 
even in a downturn 
to make up for their extra risk junk bonds pay a higher interest 
rate junk bond mutual funds have been yielding 12 percent or more 
recently compared with about 9 percent for investmentgrade bond 
funds and 8 percent for treasury bond funds 
litvack said the assets of fidelitys junkbond mutual fund 
surged from 17 billion at the end of march to about 2 billion 
last week 
while most investment companies would be happy to see their 
investment funds grow bostonbased fidelity is concerned it 
believes many of the new investors some of whom pulled money out 
of other safer fidelity mutual funds dont know what theyre 
getting into 
right now there is a misperception about what drives the 
performance of these securities said litvack fidelitys vice 
president of marketing interest rates are not the primary driver 
of these funds its much more a function of the economy 
with investmentgrade bonds declining interest rates usually 
lead to higher bond prices thats because bonds keep paying the 
same fixed interest while rates available elsewhere are becoming 
less attractive 
but junkbond traders are more concerned about the financial 
health of the companies that issued the bonds if the economy sours 
these companies would be at risk of not earning enough to pay the 
interest on the bonds or even of outright default 
a lot of these junk bonds havent been tested in a down 
market said brian s mattes a spokesman for the vanguard group 
another major mutualfund operator 
there could be a stampede out of the fund in a recession he 
said there will be a lot of people running for the door at the 
same time in fact the price may go down more because of that 
vanguard has seen the assets of its junkbond fund grow 13 
percent in the past two months from about 114 billion at the end 
of april to about 129 billion last week some is from appreciation 
and the rest from new investors 
mattes said vanguard based in valley forge pa sent brochures 
to its customers to warn them of the risks of its junkbond fund 
it should not be viewed as a shortterm investment at all he 
said longterm investors would be at a lesser risk of losing 
principal because they could ride out an economic downturn 
investors expecting declining interest rates should put their 
money in treasury funds litvack said 
in fact total return on treasury bonds the total interest paid 
plus any change in the bond prices exceeded that of the 
higheryielding junk bonds in the first five months of this year 
the januarymay return on sevenyear treasury bonds exceeded 6 
percent while fidelitys junkbond fund returned only 226 percent 
and vanguards returned 212 percent due to major declines in the 
price of these bonds as the economy slowed according to lipper 
analytical services corp 
litvack said junkbond funds are not for investors saving for 
retirement or other needs 
one major mutualfund company dreyfus corp said it is so 
concerned about the risks of junkbond funds that it doesnt sponsor 
one 
the underlying basis for junk bonds is that economic expansion 
will continue forever enabling highly leveraged companies to meet 
their heavy debt burdens said howard stein dreyfus chairman and 
chief executive 
dreyfus he said is not that optimistic

recent events show that in modern business 
unlike modern warfare defeated soldiers often rise to fight again 
another day 
indicted but undaunted junkbond king michael milken announced 
june 15 the day of his resignation from drexel burnham lambert 
inc that he was striking out on his own in a new firm 
milken might have trouble getting clients since he faces 185 
billion in forfeitures and a lengthy jail term if convicted on fraud 
and racketeering charges but at age 42 hes willing to give it a 
shot 
t boone pickens is another resilient loser after being told 
repeatedly that he could not have three seats on the board of a 
japanese auto parts maker the texas oilman went to the companys 
annual meeting in tokyo anyway the answer remained the same no 
but he said he would press on 
arthur goldberg spent this past week trying to extricate himself 
from what he called an embarrassing situation his company 
integrated resources inc had just defaulted on 955 million in 
shortterm debt by the end of the week he had patched together a 
refinancing plan with the help of drexel that just might win 
grudging approval of creditors 
even those prophets of cold nuclear fusion martin fleischmann 
and stanley pons showed it was too soon to write them off entirely 
general electric co announced this past week it would collaborate 
with the university of utah on tabletop fusion in spite of 
scientists widespread skepticism 
there are other irrepressible figures out there bennett s 
lebow the oftdefeated bidder for prime computer inc and jerry 
tucker the oftdefeated leader of the new directions dissident 
movement of the united auto workers 
what unites the diverse characters is a fine understanding of the 
nature of capitalism which may be the greatest recycling machine 
ever invented 
as long as an enterprise or an idea has any value speculators 
and entrepreneurs will find a way to extract it like a scavenger 
who strips the battery from an abandoned car there is money or a 
reputation to be made 
people like milken and pickens know the odds against them are 
long but that just makes the potential returns sweeter the same 
goes for ge which undoubtedly is getting a cheaper deal with utah 
than if other companies were also clamoring to get in on cold 
fusion the investment might just pay off big thats capitalism 
charles darwin wrote in the origin of species that the tree 
of life fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the 
earth if darwin had worked on wall street he might have gone on 
to observe that those dead branches sometimes carry the seeds for 
even taller trees 
in other business news this past week 
stock investors changed their minds about the economy signs of 
an economic slowdown used to cheer investors by raising prospects 
for lower interest rates but this past week fears of recession 
spread especially after the government reported a 
largerthanexpected decline in the index of leading economic 
indicators for may 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 9181 points in the 
week its biggest weekly drop since 10842 points the week of march 
2125 1988 
the biggest takeover fight of the moment headed into the weekend 
with time inc shareholders reelecting a slate of directors who 
oppose a 122 billion bid for time by paramount communications inc 
the directors instead favor a 14 billion offer by time for warner 
communications inc which they say would create a powerful 
communications company 
and finally the bank of canada stopped issuing dollar bills 
friday in the latest step of a program to phase in the 11sided 
goldcolored loonie coin

whether they are out in yachts or rowboats this 
july fourth weekend a lot of stockmarket investors are surely 
wondering whether the currents have shifted on wall street 
in the last few days leading up to midyear the negative economic 
news that has been enthusiastically received for months in the 
financial world suddenly wasnt so welcome any more 
what appeared to be the turning point was the governments report 
wednesday that the index of leading economic indicators a primary 
statistical tool for measuring future trends took a 
largerthanexpected 12 percent drop in may 
that reinforced the prevailing view that the economy was slowing 
fulfilling a primary goal of recent federal reserve policy and it 
seemed to increase the chances that the fed would move more 
aggressively to ease credit conditions before long 
following the standard script interest rates fell in the bond 
market reducing the competitive appeal of bonds and moneymarket 
investments in comparison to stocks 
but the stock market instead of rising embarked on a steep 
decline that lasted through the end of the week maybe traders 
seemed to be thinking the slowdown is happening too fast 
it didnt help much that several technical analysts who 
concentrate on trends within the market itself rather than 
developments in the economy were warning that stocks were ripe for 
a setback 
the stock and bond markets and the us dollar are about to 
enter into a prolonged consolidation phase that could drag through 
the entire third quarter said joseph barthel technical analyst 
at butcher amp singer inc 
the end result of these expected consolidations will be to 
relieve the overbought and overbelieved conditions now surrounding 
the three markets 
the markets headed for a fall declared joseph feshbach at 
prudentialbache securities our caution flag for the second half 
is at full staff 
investors didnt wait for the second half to act on those 
warnings and fears in the last week of what had been a robust 
prosperous first half for the bulls stocks took their sharpest drop 
in more than a year 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 9181 points to 
244006 for its largest weekly loss since it tumbled 10842 points 
march 2125 1988 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 496 to 
17790 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
slumped 1307 to 43529 and the american stock exchange market 
value index was down 528 at 35897 
volume on the big board averaged 16215 million shares a day 
against 16849 million the week before 
to some observers the flareup of recession worries was actually 
a positive for the markets longerterm prospects 
the soft landing thesis that all would go well for the 
economy had acquired too many believers they said and it was 
inevitable that money managers at investing institutions would begin 
to question what might go wrong 
not to worry advised stephen leeb editor of the advisory 
letter indicator digest in postwar history we have never had a 
broadbased correction in stocks when prices of bonds were in an 
uptrend 
nevertheless the recessionornot debate seems likely to have 
climbed to a spot high on wall streets agenda for the immediate 
future 
if the pattern established this past week holds that could mean 
that the bond and stock markets diverge from the parallel paths they 
have followed for much of the 1980s 
fears of deflation prevailing over fears of inflation might fuel 
strong demand for highquality interestbearing securities like 
treasury bonds while leaving investors leery of stocks and 
lowerquality debt such as junk bonds

fear that discord among the worlds major coffee producers will 
spark a collapse of the markets 26yearold pricesupport machinery 
kept the coffee futures market on edge this past week 
traders caffeine jitters were tempered late in the week by hopes 
that members of the international coffee organization will find a 
way to avert a crisis 
on other markets precious metals slumped but ended the week on a 
strong note energy prices seesawed in volatile trading wheat 
started strong but dipped by weeks end corn and soybean prices 
were mostly stronger and meat and livestock prices were mixed 
the latest signal of hope in the coffee market unconfirmed 
reports that the ico may decide to postpone a vote on whether to 
extend the agreement with some sort of pricesupport mechanism in 
place sent prices soaring friday at new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange 
the current sixyear pricesupport deal is due to expire sept 
30 and member nations of the ico composed of 74 major coffee 
producers and consumers are at odds over proposals for a new 
agreement 
members of the ico are scheduled to vote monday on two 
pricesupport proposals one would extend the existing agreement as 
is with no change in quotas the other calls for extension with 
changes that would increase the availability of mild arabica coffees 
one of the most popular varieties 
adding to the confusion is a recommendation from the icos 
executive board to extend the pact for two years but to abolish its 
pricestabilizing quota machinery the result would leave coffee 
prices after sept 30 subject to freemarket forces for the first 
time since 1963 
the board which met thursday and friday also called for an ico 
vote on immediate suspension of the quota system if it rejects the 
two proposals as some analysts have predicted it will do 
the executive board acts merely as an advisory group and the 
full ico is not bound by its recommendation 
its a very nervous market simply because it is being pushed 
around by these very contradictory statements arthur stevenson 
an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york said 
friday prices have been extremely erratic he said 
the reports that the ico may postpone the vote for several weeks 
was considered bullish because it would imply that if they do 
then the producers and the consumers will have more time to reach a 
compromise stevenson said 
but the week opened on a bearish note with reports that 
colombia the worlds second largest coffee producer would move to 
abolish all export quotas unless the ico can agree on one of the two 
proposals 
that sent coffee futures prices plunging 163 cents to 605 cents 
monday with the july contract at 111 a pound the markets 
lowest close since aug 2 1988 
but they rebounded wednesday on vague hopes for a solution and 
again on friday settling 50 cent to 325 cents higher with the 
july contract at 11137 a pound
