white house and congressional budget 
negotiators reached a tentative agreement thursday night on a 
framework for the fiscal 1990 budget that sidesteps political pain 
for members of both parties 
bargainers worked until after 11 pm alternatively thrashing 
out the details behind closed doors in a capitol office and 
shopping around parts of the tentative deal to their colleagues 
sources said the participants had reached a consensus but did 
not completely rule out a lastminute snag before presenting it to 
president bush at a white house meeting set for friday morning 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash told reporters as 
thursdays session ended that the negotiators would reconvene in 
the morning shortly before the session with bush 
im fairly optimistic well have something he said 
its likely there will be agreement sometime prior to the 
white house meeting said rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking 
republican on the house budget committee in fact id say im 
almost certain 
the monthlong talks have been aimed at reaching agreement on a 
plan that would slice the deficit for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 to 100 billion as required by the grammrudman balanced 
budget law 
because the bush administration and congressional leaders have 
agreed to use optimistic economic projections they have said they 
can hit the target by agreeing to 28 billion worth of savings 
the fiscal 1989 deficit is expected to exceed 170 billion and 
many economists and others believe that the budget negotiators 
would have to find billions of dollars more in savings if they used 
more realistic assumptions the optimistic projections negate the 
need for even tougher savings decisions 
negotiators have been discussing splitting the savings evenly 
between spending reductions and new revenues 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways 
and means committee confirmed thursday that the bargainers had 
agreed to pick up 53 billion in additional taxes 
bush has insisted often that he will live up to his campaign 
pledge of opposing what he calls new taxes the agreement 
which leaves the decisions on the types of taxes for later allows 
bush to claim he has honored that promise 
bush favors raising 48 billion by cutting capital gains taxes 
which he says would prod the economy democrats oppose the idea 
the rest of the revenue would come from selling federal assets 
and raising fees the government charges for certain services 
on the spending side about half the savings would come from 
restraining the projected growth in benefit programs that are 
automatically paid to recipients such as the medicare health 
program for the elderly and disabled 
negotiators have discussed gimmicks such as claiming up to 2 
billion in savings by moving the us postal service 
offbudget and close to 1 billion by shifting some farm 
subsidy payments planned for 1990 into this year 
even if an agreement is announced congress will have to enact a 
budget resolution reflecting the pact the legal deadline for that 
resolution is april 15 and as usual lawmakers will miss it by at 
least several weeks spending and tax legislation reflecting the 
budgets strictures then follows

insects they crawled over the ground laying the track and rolling 
on it and picking it up diesel tractors puttering while they 
stood idle they thundered when they moved and then settled down 
to a droning roar john steinbeck the grapes of wrath 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
finished this day and i hope its good john 
steinbeck wrote in his journal in 1938 
the book he had just completed was the grapes of wrath a 
novel that would awaken the social conscience of americans in a way 
that uncle toms cabin the jungle and few other works f 
fiction have 
viking press which published the grapes of wrath on april 
14 1939 is marking the 50th anniversary of the book with a 
commemorative edition containing an introduction by studs terkel 
it is also publishing working days journals steinbeck kept 
during the research and writing of what critics consider his 
greatest work 
when he sat down to write his saga of the joads a dust bowl 
family migrating to california for a new life steinbeck 36 had 
already attained celebrity with tortilla flat of mice and 
men which had been made into a longrunning broadway play and 
four other novels 
he wrote what he called his big book in a fivemonth 
marathon scribbling a prodigious 2000 words a day steinbeck 
scholar robert demott who edited the journals for publication 
notes that the manuscripts strikingly show little revision 
but the author had already laid much groundwork having studied 
the migrant farmers from oklahoma texas kansas and arkansas 
derisively dubbed okies for a series of articles that 
appeared in the san francisco news he had bought an old bakery 
truck and equipped it with blankets food and camping equipment and 
spent time in a migrant resettling camp contrary to popular myth 
he never made the trek from oklahoma to california as did his 
fictional joads 
steinbeck had also written a 70000word precursor to the 
grapes of wrath that he destroyed saying the novel was too 
vicious and smartalec too much of a political tract but it 
rid him of some of the venom he felt against the associated farmers 
inc and others he felt responsible for the workers plight and 
allowed him to write what he thought was a more rounded novel 
indeed the question most frequently debated about the grapes 
of wrath which won a pulitzer prize is whether it is art or 
firebrand propaganda

sure cried the tenant farmers but its our land we were 
born on it and got killed on it and we died on it even if its 
no good its still ours thats what makes it ours that makes

</TEXT>

immediately after its release newspaper editorials legislators 
and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant 
life the book was burned in several cities including salinas 
calif steinbecks hometown and was banned in many libraries and 
schools 
eleanor roosevelt defended the book in her weekly column and in 
1940 a congressional committee held hearings in oklahoma to find 
out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the 
workers recounted in the novel were accurate the committees 
findings vindicated the author 
upon steinbecks death in 1968 the new york times wrote the 
following about the book the timorous and savagely reactionary 
among us were fretfully afraid that steinbeck had gone too far in 
his novels portrayal of the desperately distressed in america 
bless their hearts they were dead right he was out to rouse not 
to soothe us into asking human beings to starve quietly and 
inconspiculously during those years of depression and despair 
terkel said he finds modernday critics who call the grapes of 
wrath propaganda pretty tiresome 
you can can say moby dick is propaganda the author and 
radio raconteur said in a telephone interview from his chicago 
office 
terkel who toured the midwest in 1987 when family farms were 
foreclosing one after another and who witnessed the drought of 
1988 played out on the six oclock news finds steinbecks words 
startlingly relevant today 
its as though we never experienced the depression and hadnt 
learned anything from it said terkel who planned to mark the 
anniversary by reading from the novel on his radio show 
interspersed with selections from dustbowl ballads by woody 
guthrie 
it should be noted that while critics hashed out the literary 
merits of the book the public snapped it up in droves it was the 
bestselling book of 1939 and one of the top 10 bestsellers in 
1940 it also prduced a successful movie adaptation starring henry 
fonda that won director john ford an academy award 
the grapes of wrath remains one of vikings alltime 
bestsellers today and has sold some 14 million copies worldwide 
said viking spokesman paul slovak

in awarding steinbeck the nobel prize for literature in 1962 
the swedish academy cited the towering standard the author set 
in the grapes of wrath more than two decades earlier although 
he had produced more than a dozen novels and plays since that work 
demott founder of the steinbeck quarterly and an english 
professor at ohio university in athens ohio says in the preface 
of working days that steinbecks legacy was his willingness 
to risk everything to write the best he could with what what gifts 
he had and in doing so to reveal unblinking the enduring human 
spirit among the ruthless shapes of paradise

violence and human sacrifice among believers in 
occult religions usually involve a mixture of pantheistic beliefs 
that often are distortions of ancient rituals 
that kind of mingling and twisting of strange heterodox ideas 
and practices seemed apparent in the gruesome killings of at least 
13 people near matamoros mexico across the rio grande from 
brownsville texas 
there were hints of assorted primitive religions and 
superstitions perhaps stemming from traditions such as these or 
aberrations of them 
satanism is characterized by its antagonism toward the 
christian deity and worship of the adversary satan devotees 
consider him a supreme being of evil rivaling god 
their rites consist of mockery or perversion of christian 
ritual sometimes called the black mass at which satan is believed 
to preside ritual killings sometimes have been associated with the 
cult 
it also has been linked to assorted sexual sadomasochistic and 
psychopathic activities including grave robberies and 
bloodletting both animal and human 
symbols of the cult include the pentagram a fivepointed star 
with the single point down and the horned god in the form of a 
goat 
voodoo is a set of animistic beliefs and rites stemming from 
africa and sometimes interweaving roman catholic practices in its 
form that became pervasive in haiti 
voodoo worshipers believe in one god but also in numerous 
spirits or lesser deities magic and witchcraft have proliferated 
in relation to voodoo including casting of spells and fates on 
others good or ill this often involves use of effigies of 
another along with bits of clothing or hair from the person 
certain advanced practicioners or houngans are considered 
healers also enabled to take posssession of the spirit of others 
singing and dancing are part of the rituals 
the chief deity is called damballah sometimes symbolized by 
a serpent 
santeria is an offshoot of voodoo that has spread into latin 
america and which calls its main god chango a god of fire and 
stone santeria like voodoo involves use of various botanical 
ingredients and other items considered magic 
related cults have derived from santeria with pantheons of gods 
such as elegba god of luck ogun god of metal ifa god of 
divination and eshju the trickster 
practices of santeria and its related cults include animal 
sacrifice polygamy ecstatic dancing and the appeasement of gods 
by various offerings 
derivatives of these cults and aberrations of them also have 
turned up in various parts of the united states

villagers in southern lebanon got their 
wish the irish government has decided to keep its 750man 
batallion in the united nations peacekeeping forces here 
the government in dublin had been reconsidering the irish 
battalions presence in lebanon because four of its soldiers had 
been killed and one wounded in three attacks in the past three 
months three of them were killed by a landmine march 21 
we greatly need the irish contingent in south lebanon said 
abbas fawaz the mayor of tibnin a town 11 miles north of the 
israeli border 
the estimated 100000 shiite moslems living in 20 hamlets around 
tibnin the irish headquarters enjoy their protection fawaz 
said 
before making the decision the irish cabinet reviewed a report 
by lt gen tadhg oneill chief of staff of the irish army who 
had come here to investigate the landmine explosion march 21 
the cabinet renews irelands commitment every six months and 
the irish political opposition had called for a policy review after 
the deaths the fourth death occurred earlier 
our presence here is very vital to the security of the area 
and to the locals who depend on our humanitarian aide said lt 
col pat mcmahon commander of the irish contingent in the united 
nations interim force in lebanon unifil 
on march 30 hundreds of tebnins 5000 residents participated 
in a memorial ceremony for the three irish soldiers killed by the 
landmine 
the irish contingent lives among its people in the south 
said one of the banners at the ceremony aggression against it is 
aggression on the southerners 
the un peacekeeping force made up of 5800 personnel from 
nine nations has monitored a narrow strip of 65towns and villages 
in south lebanon since march 1985 
the population in the forces area of operation increased from 
about 50000 when the force first arrived to about a half million 
people today 
before unifil came to south lebanon the area was a free 
terrain to militiamen and terrorists who spread fear and death 
everywhere said fawaz 64 who has been mayor for 20 years 
now everyone is moving around here peacefully and freely 
thanks to the irish battalion 
an irish sergeant about to be moved out on routine rotation said 
he was leaving with mixed feelings 
there are a lot of poor people here who are in great need of 
our humanitarian work which is worth risking my life for said 
the sergeant who could not allow his name to be used because of 
standing regulations 
an irish major at headquarters in tebnin said it would be a 
fire zone without us 
when the irish battalion first came here the villagers did 
not have any electricity and had shortages of water he said 
but we helped them and now they are confident in their future 
because of us 
the irish battalion has lost 30 soldiers in attacks by various 
groups over the years 
investigations were still under way to determine who planted the 
landmine that exploded under a unifil jeep near haddatha on march 
21 and killed the three soldiers lt col patrick hayes said 
the other two recent attacks were carried out by the 
israelibacked south lebanon army sla militia which controls a 
narrow strip of lebanese territory that israel refers to as its 
security zone 
israel maintained the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its 
invading army from south lebanon in the summer of 1985 ending a 
threeyear occupation 
the terrain which extends from the mediterranean sea in the 
west to the slopes of snowpeaked mount hermon in the east serves 
as a buffer against crossborder infiltrations by palestinian 
guerrillas into northern israeli settlements 
col mcmahon blamed israel for the south lebanon army attacks on 
the irish battalion he said such hostilities were due to the 
lack of control from the israeli army command on the sla 
militiamen 
hassan fawaz the son of tebnins mayor who owns a gift shop 
near the irish battalion headquarters said tebnin residents 
notify the irish command about the possibility of any attack on 
them that we come to know of 
the younger fawaz stressed the economic value that the irish 
battalion represents to the area the troops spend at least 
500000 annually on souvenirs and goods they buy dutyfree from 
local stores

abbie hoffman the yippie who clung to his 60s 
ideals amid an onslaught of 80s yuppiedom was remembered thursday 
as a radical and a joker who could provoke a laugh even as he 
outraged and informed 
its like a hallucination jerry rubin said of hoffmans 
death i still dont believe it frankly i still think its an 
abbie media event 
hoffman 52 years old and still antiestablishment as ever died 
peacefully in his bed wednesday according to michael waldron his 
landlord in new hope pa 
an autopsy to determine the cause of death was inconclusive and 
bucks county district attorney alan rubenstein said toxicological 
tests would begin friday 
hoffmans mother said the family assumed hoffman had committed 
suicide he had sounded very depressed in recent telephone 
conversations with his brother jack she said 
he had to do what he had to do florence hoffman 83 said 
from her worcester mass home i dont know why i dont know 
what happened 
rubin who cofounded the youth international party with hoffman 
during the heyday of drugs sex rock n roll and piethrowing 
recalled that abbie was a very very serious person but he did 
it all with a smile 
during the chicago seven trial he got the prosecution 
laughing he got the judge laughing he got the jury laughing he 
blew kisses to the jury he was extremely disarming said rubin 
now an entrepreneur 
his hair a tangle of long wild curls hoffman could be seen 
with the word free written on his forehead he was arrested 42 
times the last two years ago when he protested cia recruitment at 
the university of massachusetts 
in a satiric gesture he threw dollar bills on the floor of the 
american stock exchange in the late 60s and people scrambled to 
pick them up he went on television in the early 70s and talked 
about censorship while his upper body was blacked out because he 
was wearing an american flag shirt 
he wrote books revolution for the hell of it and steal 
this book 
he was always thinking ahead and always laughing agreed 
folk singer pete seeger who most recently worked with hoffman on 
environmental causes 
hoffmans chutzpah also carried him through 6 years on the run 
in september 1980 he turned himself in to new york authorities 
on a 1973 charge of selling 3 pounds of cocaine for three years 
he had lived as screenwriter barry freed in fineview ny 
playing on a softball team against the us customs service and 
speaking on local television and radio shows about environmental 
issues 
as freed he even testified before senate subcommittee hearings 
and posed for a picture with an unaware sen daniel patrick 
moynihan 
the humor promoted the message said fellow 60s denizen 
mark rudd now an author and lecturer living in albuquerque nm 
he was a genius at crystallizing peoples feelings 
once in 1968 we are at a movement conference that was 
getting too serious he got up while i was talking and put on a 
great show of skill with his electric yoyo 
but there was a darker side as well 
friends reported that hoffman had seemed depressed before his 
death according to bucks county district attorney alan m 
rubenstein 
a longterm depression was the flip side of his high the thing 
about abbie is that he was a visionary possibly because he was 
manicdepressive rudd said 
he was 52 years old and i think he gave up said his 
brother jack hoffman of framingham mass i know he was 
disappointed in the young people of today he didnt feel he was 
getting through to them he was disenchanted 
the question of disillusionment never never never rudd 
said he had never given up he was very hopeful 
i think he felt more disappointment than bitterness rubin 
said i think he was disappointed that the social excitement of 
the 60s did not continue 
just last week hoffman who criticized college campuses in 
recent years as bastions of rest said while appearing at 
vanderbilt university that he was saddened by the interest todays 
young people have in the 1960s 
when you see young people nostalgic for a youth they didnt 
even experience its a little sad he said during the appearance 
with timothy leary theyre supposed to be out making one for 
themselves 
on another occasion he said 1968 was a great wonderful 
year they dont make years like that anymore and if it werent 
for our efforts wed have a president today sending troops off to 
exotic countries like lebanon and grenada and bombing cities like 
tripoli 
hoffman made the most out of his own life compatriots said 
he caused millions of youths to unite behind him to protest 
this war in vietnam said bobby seale the former black panther 
leader 
he was an important person of my generation and he will be 
dearly missed said california assemblyman tom hayden a chicago 
seven defendant 
he embodied the great american virtue of protest and 
dissidence and speaking truth to authority rudd said he was 
kind of like our thoreau 
jack hoffman borrowed a quote from his brother to praise his 
iconoclastic life 
abbie would probably like to be remembered in these his own 
words there is absolutely no greater high than challenging the 
power structure as a nobody giving it your all and winning

the failure of three candidates for federal 
judge to answer whether the white house screened them on how they 
would rule on cases has frozen senate committee action on the 
nominations for at least a week 
we have a responsibility to advise and consent to the 
selection of judges and to know what the process was in that 
selection sen edward m kennedy dmass said thursday after 
calling for a halt in judiciary committee action 
responding to kennedy chairman joseph biden ddel postponed 
for one week consideration of district judge pamela ann rymer of 
los angeles as an appellate judge and robert c bonner of pasadena 
calif and melinda f harmon of houston as district judges 
none of the three responded to written questions from kennedy on 
whether they had been screened by the administration on how they 
might decide cases that could come before them 
some lawmakers also were critical of a letter on the subject 
sent by the justice department on wednesday it is one of the 
most dramatically inept letters i have ever seen come before this 
committee said sen patrick leahy dvt 
kennedy had asked judge rymer to list all interviews or 
communications you had with the white house staff or the justice 
department regarding your nomination and the dates of such 
interviews or communications and identify all persons present or 
participating in such interviews 
his questions submitted in writing by biden asked if she had 
any communication with any member of the white house staff or the 
justice department referring or relating to your views on any case 
issue subject or area of the law that could come before the court 
to which you have been nominated 
they also asked for names and dates as well as any 
communication relating to your judicial philosophy or your legal 
writings or judicial opinions similar questions were put to 
harmon and bonner 
biden said that when there was no response to the questions he 
contacted the justice department and received a draft letter 
replying to the queries the letter was a draft and not the 
finished product because attorney general richard thornburgh could 
not show the letter to each of the candidates before sending it to 
the committee the chairman said 
phrased as if written by a nominee the letter said 
1 i did not make any commitments with regard to how i might 
rule on any specific case or issue nor were any such commitments 
sought 
2 my personal views on controversial cases or issues were not 
solicited in a manner to suggest that it should commit myself to 
rule in a particular way on issues or cases to advance my nomination 
3 i do not believe i have been subjected to an ideological 
litmus test 
4 i have no doubt that everyone who interviewed me expected 
me if nominated and confirmed to exercise my best independent 
judgment on every matter brought before me 
david runkel a spokesman for the attorney general said we 
think the letter is responsive 
kennedy said that he had not heard of the letter until he was on 
his way to the judiciary committee session and wanted more time to 
consider the issue

a contest billed as the nations first 
indoor croquet tournament will include the use of balls that dont 
need grass to slow them down 
at least 50 players from 14 colleges have signed up for the 
third national collegiate croquet tournament at the former bible 
speaks headquarters in lenox 
the threeday tournament which began today marked the us 
debut of croquet balls invented 18 months ago by townsend croquet 
ltd of england said organizer xandra kayden of cambridge 
the hollow balls filled with fluid and glass beads create an 
internal resistance that slows them as if they were on grass 
company owner charles townsend said in a transatlantic call 
thursday the insides swish around and absorb the energy of the 
ball on a hard surface he said 
theyre wonderful said croquet coach steven sprague of 
lenox whose mother discovered the balls in a christmas catalog 
it slows the ball down a little differently than balls slowed by 
grass but you get used to it 
townsend said he invented the balls at the request of several 
britons who wanted to use village halls for croquet matches during 
their wet winters he also invented spikeless wickets that can be 
taped to floors 
the balls have been used in a few small tournaments in england 
but not to townsends knowledge in the united states ms kayden 
said the lenox tournament is the first to be played indoors and to 
use the balls

portauprince haiti ap the failure of an attempted coup 
against lt gen prosper avril has left the haitian leader in a 
stronger position to carry out his usbacked program of 
democratic reform and drug busting 
but events of the past two weeks exposed the continuing threat 
to stability posed by the impoverished caribbean nations poorly 
trained and corruptionridden army 
it is a question now of whether avril a former adviser to the 
duvalier family dictatorship who became president in a military 
coup seven months ago has the power and the will to fulfill his 
pledge of irreversible democracy 
so far all we have are his democratic promises said a 
western european diplomat haitians have grown skeptical of such 
promises 
diplomats said the trigger for the april 2 coup attempt was 
avrils dismissal the previous week of four army colonels accused 
of drug running loyal troops rescued the president as he was being 
driven handcuffed to the airport to be deported 
the government said the plot was hatched by former haitian 
interior minister and longtime avril foe roger lafontant who 
lives in the neighboring dominican republic and other exiles 
linked to jeanclaude baby doc duvalier who fled into exile in 
france in february 1986 
four officers not those dismissed earlier were identified as 
ringleaders col guy francois commander of the 750man dessalines 
battalion col himmler rebu commander of the 400man leopards 
corps col phillipe biamby commander of the 1100man 
presidential guard and col qualo leonce an administrative 
officer and godson to lafontant 
avril deported rebu biamby and leonce to new york where they 
were detained by us immigration officials and francois 
subsequently was given asylum by the vatican embassy in 
portauprince 
no sooner had avril escaped the coup attempt than the leopards 
and dessalines rebelled loyalist troops crushed the mutiny in a 
twoday assault on the dessalines barracks adjoining the national 
palace the leopards ended their revolt with no further fighting 
defeat of the dessalines battalion the armys second biggest 
unit and traditional maker and breaker of haitian presidents would 
appear to remove one of the most serous threats to avrils 
authority 
the battalion widely regarded as the most repressive and 
corrupt in the army was previously led by col jeanclaude paul 
who was indicted on drug charges in miami and died last november 
reportedly after drinking poisoned soup 
nobody has been as powerful as avril is now said pierre 
raymond dumas a prominent haitian author and military expert 
he said avril still faces the task of training the army into a 
disciplined force what we have is an armed gang not a real 
army 
during their 29year rule jeanclaude and his father francois 
papa doc duvalier who died in 1971 corrupted the officers 
corps and encouraged rivarly among units they promoted zealots 
regardless of merit and created a private militia of thugs known as 
the tonton macoute 
avril has fired or forced into retirement more than 140 officers 
since coming to power in a sept 17 coup led by noncomissioned 
officers preaching democracy and respect for human rights 
he has partially restored the 1987 constitution suspended by 
his predecessor the tyrannical lt gen henri namphy and 
approved the establishment of an electoral council to organize 
elections of a civilian government 
democratic reform and a crackdown on drug trafficking are among 
conditions set by the united states for restoring 70 million in 
aid suspended after the abortive elections of november 1987 in 
which thugs supported by the army massacred 34 voters at polling 
stations 
us ambassador brunson mckinley said the prospects for 
democracy are good provided avril can hold together and continue 
to move toward the goal of elections 
although humanrights organizations have accused avril of 
continued abuses us officials have said they are satisfied with 
progress he has made in moving toward democracy 
i expect that within weeks the state department will announce 
a resumption of aid said larry birns director of the 
washingtonbased council on hemispheric affairs which has been 
critical of us policy on haiti 
im extremely skeptical about avril as a person but this 
whole affair may force him to accelerate democratization because 
he needs us aid birns said 
avril now realizes that without a civilian political base he 
is vulnerable to coups he will likely speed up the democratic 
process not out of any noble cause but for his own survival

house democrats are girding for a bruising 
battle over the ethics case of their speaker jim wright of texas 
and acknowledging that the worst may be yet to come 
we havent hit bottom yet said rep charles wilson a 
fellow texan who is among wrights most battleready defenders 
wilson said he expects more damage to wright when the house ethics 
committee releases its report monday and formally charges the 
speaker with several dozen rules violations 
but even before the charges were lodged wright was beginning 
his counteroffensive in a carefully scripted and sometimes 
emotional speech on thursday he vehemently denied any intentional 
wrongdoing 
i am confident that in the 34 years ive served in the 
congress i have not violated any of those basic rules nor any 
commonly accepted standard of ethical behavior wright told a 
packed room of reporters and television cameras 
with his top leadership lieutenants and many texas colleagues at 
his side wright grew emotional as he defended his wife against a 
charge she did not do adequate work for the 18000ayear salary 
she was paid by a fort worth business partner 
my wife is a good decent caring thoroughly honorable 
person he said his voice choking ill damned well fight to 
protect her honor and her integrity against any challenge by any 
source whatever the cost 
the defense buoyed democrats who already support the speaker 
and many seemed prepared to fight 
if you live in a glass house you shouldnt throw rocks 
said rep charles stenholm dtexas most of us in the house are 
prepared to eat a steady diet of glass for the next few weeks 
but others were dreading the battles to come and some expressed 
doubts whether the party could afford politically to maintain 
wright as its most visible spokesman particularly if the case 
leads to punishment 
the ground would start to move under him if he were 
reprimanded said rep pat williams dmont 
the mood is bleak rep robert mrazek dny told the new 
york times there is recognition by virtually all of the people i 
would consider professional politicians that he will not survive 
and he added for the first time a couple of texans have said to 
me they think its all over 
the ethics committee six democrats and six republicans put the 
final touches on its report late thursday and scheduled a monday 
morning news conference to release it the report will include a 
statement of alleged violations enumerating several dozen 
specific violations of house rules said sources familiar with the 
investigation 
under the rules the panels standard for issuing such a 
citation the equivalent of an indictment is that it has found 
reason to believe the violations occurred for the committee to 
prove those charges requires the more difficult standard of clear 
and convincing evidence 
wright asked that he be allowed as soon as possible to go before 
the ethics panel and present his defense and begin offering 
rebuttal evidence 
along with the concern over wrights standing came worry that 
the ethics committee might be setting a new and more difficult 
standard for congressional behavior particularly in calling a 
spouses income a gift and in determining that the business 
partner who paid mrs wright george mallick had a direct interest 
in legislation before the congress 
mallick paid mrs wrights salary and gave the wrights free use 
of a condominium in fort worth and a 1979 cadillac under the 
rules a lawmaker can accept no more than 100 a year in gifts from 
a person with direct legislative interests 
on that issue the most potentially damaging to wright among all 
the charges the ethics committee voted 84 to find reason to 
believe the gifts to the wrights were improper with democrats 
chet atkins of massachusetts and bernard dwyer of new jersey siding 
with the six committee republicans 
one source said the panel based its finding not on any specific 
interest mallick had but on the more general grounds that as an 
investor in real estate and oil and gas ventures he had an inherent 
direct interest in congressional action on matters such as savings 
and loan regulation and taxation 
the other issues were more clear cut the source said on 
whether the car and condominium constituted unreported gifts the 
panel was unanimous the vote was 102 to place mrs wrights 
salary in that category and it also was 102 to hold that wright 
sought to evade outside income limits through bulk sales of his 
book reflections of a public man

cable television executives have for the first 
time publicly demonstrated their ability to transmit a 
highdefinition tv signal completely through a typical cable 
system 
the test was carried out thursday on jones intercable facilities 
in anne arundel county md northeast of washington and on media 
general cable equipment in fairfax county va last week 
the demonstration was designed to show that regular coaxial 
cable can carry an hdtv picture to a tv receiver with existing 
technology and without significant loss of quality 
officials of the national cable television association declared 
the test a success and said it shows that it is not necessary to 
have expensive fiberoptic cable systems to provide advanced 
television service 
telephone companies currently barred from providing cable 
programming or cable service in their telephone areas are seen as 
having a potential major role in the market and are advocating use 
of glass fiber cables that transmit voice video and data signals 
on laser beams 
brenda fox ncta vice president and general counsel told 
reporters at thursdays demonstration that it shows coaxial or 
bundled wire cables can retransmit the quality of picture and 
sound that everyone talks about in highdefinition television 
she said the 40channel jones intercable is a typical cable 
system and the successful test shows we can transmit an hdtv 
signal on classic systems around the country 
proponents of highdefinition television say it can provide 
pictures with the quality of 35mm film and sound equivalent to 
compact disc recordings 
thursdays demonstration did indeed show very highquality 
images of ice skaters the 1984 los angeles olympics movie clips 
and boxer mike tyson on three separate receivers a 50inch 
projection tv a 32inch cathode ray tube set and a smaller crt in 
which the hdtv signal was converted to the socalled ntsc signal 
that standard sets display 
the demonstration utilized a japanese musee hdtv signal that 
was sent from home box office facilities in long island ny to 
the satcom k1 satellite and relayed to a jones intercable receiving 
dish on the ground 
from there the signal was sent through 28 miles of coaxial 
cable including 26 amplifiers and then displayed on the three tv 
sets ncta said 
cable executives said it was the first endtoend hdtv test 
in which all elements of a delivery system from program 
origination point to the tv set were used 
paul heimbach hbos vice president of engineering said the 
test provided a very acceptable signal at the end 
hbo may be one of the first companies in this country to provide 
hdtv programs particularly if the japanese as expected begin to 
introduce hdtv receivers vcrs and video discs into this country 
the japanese already are far ahead of us companies in 
developing hdtv and made a smallscale test of a 
satellitedelivered system earlier this month 
heimbach said that since most of hbos programs already are 35mm 
films it would be a natural progression for hbo to enter the hdtv 
arena once the demand is there 
hdtv wont be cheap tv sets are expected to be in the 
30004000 range initially and it is possible that programming 
will cost more than at present 
but heimbach said preliminary results of a recent survey of 
consumers in kansas city mo showed about a third of those who 
viewed an hdtv test said theyd willing to pay more to receive hdtv 
ncta will continue to test hdtv systems as they become 
available a number of american japanese and european systems have 
been proposed but so far only japan has developed equipment 
capable of testing 
the federal communications commission ruled last year that any 
us hdtv system cannot make existing ntsc tv sets obsolete the 
musee system is not compatible with current sets 
fox said cable executives want to try to reach agreement with 
overtheair broadcasters on a common hdtv standard 
were not trying to beat the other guy she said

in newspaper columns and editorial 
pages alaskans are unleashing their fury at the oil spill that has 
defiled prince william sound and imperiled livelihoods drawn from 
the sea 
the volume of letters to newspaper editors in some areas remains 
high even three weeks after the spill that sent 101 million 
gallons of oil into the sound and at least two editorial boards 
have recast their positions on a tax change for oil companies 
editors of the two anchorage daily newspapers said they can 
think of no other issue that has generated so much mail much of it 
has hammered the oil industry 
were busier than weve ever been said michael carey 
editorial page editor of the anchorage daily news which on april 9 
devoted a section front and inside space to letters about the spill 
anchorage times editor in chief william j tobin said most of 
his instate mail has condemned exxon the owner of the tanker 
involved in the spill 
the tone of the letters from outside the state says in 
effect alaska we mourn with you in this terrible tragedy 
tobin said 
i really havent seen a letter yet that was favorable to the 
oil companies said andy williams editorial page editor of the 
fairbanks daily newsminer 
even industry friend val molyneux president of the alaska 
support industry alliance was cautious in a letter sent to the 
homer news and several other papers 
we as alaskans share in a collective sense of loss and shock 
as a result of the tragedy in prince william sound molyneux 
wrote there must be a lesson learned 
in a telephone interview wednesday molyneux said that despite 
the exxon accident alaskans should not forget the good things the 
oil industry has brought 
i still believe the longterm future of the state is in the 
resources and the major resource is oil molyneux said 
that is apparently on the minds of few letter writers 
the oil industry has created a system that is a disaster 
waiting to happen wrote lara purtel in the anchorage daily news 
another reader james sykes said oil companies had little 
incentive to guard against spills or conduct speedy cleanups 
because of liability limits spillrelated tax writeoffs and the 
ability to raise gasoline prices 
among the few letters supportive of the oil industry was one 
from suzanne mclaughlin of anchorage 
oil really does feed my family and pay my taxes she wrote 
in a letter in the anchorage times and dont kid yourself it 
does yours too 
oil finances 85 percent of alaskas state budget and it was oil 
wealth that created the permanent fund a state savings account 
that generates annual dividends for alaskans the 1988 payment for 
every qualified man woman and child in the state topped 800 
to most editorial writers the figures behind the industrys 
impact on alaska wealth are as familiar as their home phone 
numbers but two newspapers say the statistics are no longer 
sufficient to support positions they held less than a month ago 
giving tax breaks to the oil industry 
the tax structure was altered to reduce the burden on oil 
companies as marginal oil fields declined but the stillrich 
prudhoe bay region was inadvertently included as well an effort is 
underway to revise the structure which now provides oil companies 
with a 150 million annual tax break 
the ketchikan daily news modified its position on the proposed 
revision and the juneau empire reversed its stand 
ketchikan daily news publisher lew williams said his newspaper 
had been wavering on the tax issue but theres no wavering 
now weve got to make some changes and get some money from the 
oil companies 
before we felt as though the oil industry had been paying its 
share of the cost of running state government said carl sampson 
empire managing editor two and a half weeks ago though we 
started thinking about some of the nonmonetary costs that 
would come out of the oil spill 
we felt as though there had been a betrayal of trust between 
alaskans and the oil companies

the ohio democratic party chairman put the 
best political face on the nervewrenching drama surrounding the 
speaker of the house my candidate for mayor of toledo isnt 
going to be hurt by jim wright he said 
but many democrats fear wrights troubles are their troubles 
the texas congressman is the partys highest ranking elected 
official and one of its most visible spokesmen 
as such he is an easy target for republicans their house 
leadership sharpened by the recent selection of wright tormentor 
newt gingrich as gop whip 
among house democrats as well as among party officials across 
the country the concern was palpable thursday as it became clear 
the house ethics committee was prepared to charge wright with 
violating house rules 
im not hearing much said iowa democratic party chairman 
bonnie campbell when asked if wright was becoming a political 
issue in her state to the extent i do its democrats fearing 
the worst 
the speaker went on the offensive declaring that he was 
confident that in the 34 years i have been in the congress i 
have not violated those basic rules nor any commonly accepted 
standard of ethical conduct 
he vowed to fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy 
that i possess to clear my good name 
watching on television as wright defended himself was charles 
whitehead chairman of the florida democratic party 
it certainly doesnt help us whitehead said later it 
gives the republicans an awful lot of openings 
jim ruvolo whiteheads ohio counterpart said it obviously 
depends on the extent of the charges how seriously theyre 
perceived in terms of his personal integrity if he makes a 
convincing case that these are minor infractions and he regrets 
them then they may not have long repercussions 
if hes unable to do that clearly then its a problem for 
democrats and some democrats have to sit down and talk to him about 
it ruvolo said the next couple of days will tell because its 
going to be on the news tonight 
rep dale kildee dmich said i think theres deep concern 
both as to the person of the speaker and the congress itself agony 
is probably the best word 
but greg schneiders a democratic political consultant 
questioned whether there would be much political impact from 
wrights problems 
voters are so cynical about politicians in general that 
whenever they hear about a politician doing something or being 
charged with unethical activity they say so what else is new 
they assume that about politicians until it gets to a point where 
it is really unacceptable schneiders said 
he said he does not believe the allegations against wright have 
captured the public imagination 
whitehead disagreed about the depth of cynicism 
i dont think its gotten that bad yet he said theyre 
cynical yes they expect some wrongdoing and in wrights defense 
i think this will be played out of proportion 
when the speaker appeared before reporters to defend himself he 
was flanked by the house democratic leadership 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash next in line to 
wright said the speakers arguments were very moving and very 
persuasive support for the speaker remains very very strong 
indeed among many democrats 
asked whether hed be more comfortable with wright or foley 
speaking for his party whitehead replied 
at this particular time i would feel much more comfortable if 
it was tom foley and i would think that any democrat who would be 
honest and candid would say that

house democratic whip tony coelho blames an 
error by an investment firm for records listing his campaign 
committee as the buyer of a 100000 junk bond when in reality he 
purchased it himself 
i borrowed the money made the investment sold it made a 
profit and reported the transaction on my financial disclosure 
statement for 1986 as i am required to do the california 
lawmaker said thursday in a statement 
conversion of campaign funds to personal use is against house 
rules 
the thirdranking democrat in the house acknowledged that 
records of the brokerage firm of drexel burnham lambert listed 
coelho for congress as the purchaser of the bond on april 10 
1986 
an aide david dreyer said it remains unresolved why coelhos 
records show he bought it the following month 
were going by our records dreyer said the bond was sold 
in october on the vice of coelhos accountant the statement said 
at a profit of 6882 
drexel propelled itself into the vanguard of the 1980s corporate 
buyout binge by developing the technique of financing such 
operations with junk bonds so called because they pay high 
interest but also represent high risk since then however the 
firms beverly hillsbased junk bond operation has been rocked by 
scandal 
drexels junk bond king michael milken and two others were 
indicted march 29 by a federal grand jury in new york on fraud and 
racketeering charges 
coelhos statement said that as the result of an error made by 
drexel burnham lambert inc my campaign committee was 
inaccurately carried as the purchaser even though it provided no 
money for the investment 
repeated efforts by my staff to correct what i now believe to 
be a computer error made by drexel finally resulted in my name 
being accurately listed he said he said his decision to buy 
had nothing to do with either drexel mike milken or an employee 
of drexel and neither drexel nor milken recommended it to me 
the purchase was reviewed and approved by my accountant as 
reasonable and prudent and i relied on my accountant for that kind 
of advice he said 
it was this kind of situation he said among other 
reasons that prompted me to put my investments in a blind trust 
a letter to harris trust and savings of chicago made public by 
coelhos office said drexel erroneously set this account under 
coelho for congress 
it has since been changed to tony coelho and i would 
appreciate it if you would reissue the check to tony coelho 
personally said the letter dated oct 21 1986 and signed by 
coelho administrative assistant fred hatfield 
aides to coelho and sen alan cranston dcalif said that 
cranston at the urging of coelho wrote to the securities and 
exchange commission to warn of the harmful effect on the los 
angelesarea employment situation if the agency went ahead with a 
plan to close milkens beverly hills headquarters 
coelho himself however did not write such a letter dreyer 
said

the house ethics committee will have 
considerable work to do on the jim wright case even if it grants 
the speakers request to appear quickly to defend himself against 
allegations he broke house rules 
there could be weeks and even months of committee legal 
proceedings before the panel officially called the committee on 
standards of official conduct would make a recommendation to the 
full house 
those recommendations could include no punishment a fine a 
reprimand a censure or in the most extreme case expulsion a 
reprimand involves a house vote a censure requires the additional 
step of calling the member to the front of the chamber to have the 
censure resolution read to him 
the next step for the committee in the wright case will come 
next week when it issues a statement of alleged violations 
this is similar to an indictment and based on a finding that 
there is reason to believe violations occurred each alleged 
violation must be listed as a separate count 
the statement will then trigger other proceedings 
the accused would have at least 21 days to provide a response 
which must be in writing 
wright could object to any count on the grounds that it fails 
to state facts which constitute a violation 
if wright files any motions such as a motion to dismiss the 
committee would have 30 days to make a ruling the speaker would 
then have 14 days to respond to each count not dismissed 
any of these timetables can be changed by the panel chairman 
rep julian dixon dcalif who can make proceedings go faster or 
slower 
after the timetables expire the committee would vote either to 
hold a disciplinary hearing or to defer action the latter course 
is reserved for cases where a judicial proceeding is pending 
failure to achieve a majority for either action would constitute a 
dismissal of the statement of alleged violations 
a disciplinary hearing is held in two parts 
the first phase would determine whether or not the counts have 
been proved counts are considered proved by a majority vote 
during this phase witnesses for and against the person charged 
could be heard and crossexamined the burden of proof rests with 
committee staff 
the second phase would determine what action to recommend to the

the investigation into the militarys 
150billionayear purchasing system is exanding and 
continuing a prosecutor said after the first jury convictions in 
the pentagon procurement scandal 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica said thursday after 
guilty verdicts were obtained against california businessmen george 
kaub and eugene sullivan that his office is moving ahead with the 
investigation into kickbacks and payoffs 
kaub and sullivan former vice presidents of teledyne 
electronics of newbury park calif were the first people to go 
trial as a result of the investigation which began in mid1986 
about a dozen people and defense contracting firms had pleaded 
guilty including three men who were indicted with the teledyne 
executives in january teledyne industries the parent of teledyne 
electronics had also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and filing false 
statements in advance of the trial the company paid about 43 
million in fines penalties and damages 
a jury deliberated nearly 36 hours over four days before finding 
both men guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud in a scheme 
prosecutors said involved paying a private consultant who in turn 
bribed a navy engineer for illegal assistance in helping teledyne 
win a lucrative contract 
kaub was also convicted of filing false statements a charge 
that derived from providing documents to the defense department 
which omitted information about private consultants 
the jury failed to reach a verdict on the conspiracy and wire 
fraud charges against dale schnittjer another former teledyne 
executive us district judge richard williams then dismissed the 
charges all the defendants were found innocent of bribery 
aronica called the convictions significant and said they 
marked only the start of the prosecutorial phase of the ill wind 
investigation the investigation is expanding and continuing 
he said 
mark tuohey kaubs attorney said he would appeal the guilty 
verdict against his client who faces a maximum sentence of 40 
years in jail and a fine of 2 million for conviction on eight 
counts kaub hung his head and stared at the defense table after 
the bailiff read the verdict 
sullivan whose lawyer george oconnell said he would also 
appeal could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined a maximum 
of 1 million he appeared impassive after hearing he had been 
convicted on four counts 
williams set sentencing for june 7 
aronica argued during the trial that the defendants knew private 
consultant william parkin engaged in illegal practices when 
teledyne electronics hired him in november 1985 to help secure a 
24 million contract for handheld radar equipment 
parkin who had already pleaded guilty and was cooperating with 
the government was paid an initial 10000 after teledyne won the 
contract in july 1987 he began receiving payments on an additional 
150000 that the company had promised him 
defense attorneys however said their clients were the victims 
of a conspiracy devised by parkin consultant fred lackner navy 
engineer stuart berlin and michael savaides another former 
teledyne employee who worked in washington and had pleaded guilty 
like parkin lackner and berlin were indicted at the same time 
the executives were and entered guilty pleas 
much of the evidence in the case came from wire taps on parkins 
telephone the wire fraud counts stemmed from those taperecorded 
conversations 
schnittjers attorney stanley mortenson said his client came 
to teledyne electronics after the company had been awarded the 
radar contract 
but aronica said schnittjer was the person who paid parkin about 
18000 he was to receive once the pentagon ordered the equipment 
from teledyne 
the jury found schnittjer innocent of four wire fraud counts 
but it could not reach a unanimous decision on whether schnittjer 
was guilty of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud 
williams dismissed those counts 
the pentagon procurement investigation was publicly disclosed in 
june 1988 when federal agents armed with search warrants descended 
on defense contractors from coasttocoast

aerosol makers in european economic 
community nations have agreed to sharply reduce the use of 
chemicals that harm the earths protective ozone layer the eec 
commission has announced 
the commission said the federation of european aerosol 
manufacturers will voluntarily reduce the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs in aerosol cans by 90 percent by dec 
31 1990 
since the use of cfcs in aerosols accounts for about 45 
percent of the total use of cfcs in the community we will be 
achieving with this voluntary agreement a higher reduction than 
the 20 percent reduction required under the 1987 montreal 
protocol the commission said in a statement thursday 
the montreal treaty signed by 40 nations is aimed at lowering 
the use of chlorofluorocarbons which have been blamed for the 
deterioration of the ozone layer that protects the earth from the 
cancercausing effects of ultraviolet rays and increases the 
greenhouse effect or heating of the environment 
exempted from the voluntary accord with the eec commission 
however are aerosols used in electronics and pharmaceuticals and 
some specialized industrial uses the eec commission said 
it said it will seek similar accords with other trade groups 
that use cfcs in their industries such as makers of refrigerators 
air conditioners solvents and foam plastics 
when released into the environment cfcs rise into stratosphere 
where ultraviolet rays break them up releasing chlorine and bromine 
atoms that can keep destroying the ozone layer for years

an advisory board to the pentagon is fueling 
new debate on mobile nuclear weapons by saying at least some mx 
missiles should travel on their railcar launchers at all times if 
that mode of basing is adopted 
the air force previously has sought to ease public concerns 
about nuclear weapons on the rails bysaying such missiles would 
leave their armed garrisons only in times of crisis 
but the influential defense science board said that plan would 
be more likely to provoke the soviets or any other adversary 
the problem with keeping them in the garrison at all times is 
that a president could raise tensions higher simply by sending the 
trains out and wouldnt be prepared to take that risk one 
source said thursday 
that doesnt help your nuclear deterrent any but if you have 
at least a few out there all the time the soviets know youre 
serious and that youve got a mobile missile that they cant strike 
first 
the review by the science board was first reported thursday by 
the los angeles times the defense department declined public 
comment on the matter 
the bush administration like reagan administration before it 
is struggling to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile 
to americas arsenal the idea is to make it more difficult for the 
soviet union to target us forces and thus deter russia from ever 
considering a firststrike attack 
the air force and pentagon have told congress they would like to 
buy 50 more huge mx missiles and place them on railcar launchers 
congressional democrats however would prefer to see the 
development of a small onewarhead midgetman missile that could be 
deployed on a truck launcher 
proponents and critics alike agree that placing 50 new mx 
missiles on rail cars would be vastly less expensive about 12 
billion compared with almost 25 billion for 500 midgetman 
missiles but there is also agreement that a midgetman force would 
probably be more survivable against attack 
that is because the air force in pushing for mobile mx 
missiles has always stressed it would mollify public safety 
concerns by keeping the missiles inside armed garrisons ready for 
dispersal on the regular rail network only at times of high tension 
it is that assumption that the science board is preparing to 
challenge said one source 
the board comprised of respected civilian scientists and 
engineers along with former defense officials has not submitted 
a final report yet and probably wont for awhile said one source 
but it does look like theyre raising an issue that gets 
people excited up on capitol hill 
sen john mccain rariz a member of the armed services 
committee said thursday he already had heard rumblings about 
the proposal 
its a way of justifying rail mobile mccain said the 
complaint has been that they dont have enough warning time by 
keeping some of them in motion theres much greater flexibility 
mccain who opposes the idea of trying to fund both the mx 
missile and the midgetman said the proposal will likely surface in 
the first debate to lend support to rail garrison

four of nine clean coal technology projects 
financed by the federal government are so far behind schedule the 
energy department cant estimate when they might be done and three 
others are suffering delays the government says 
but it is too soon to tell whether the delays will affect the 
timing of the commercial availability of the clean coal 
technologies keith fultz an energy expert with the general 
accounting office told a house subcommittee thursday 
in his report to the energy and power subcommittee fultz blamed 
coordination equipment and financing problems for delays in 
demonstration projects that account for about 8 million of the 42 
million spent so far by the federal government 
four clean coal technology projects are in trouble at this 
point he said 
ohio ontario clean fuels incs coaloil coprocessing project 
at warren ohio was about 13 months off track because of difficulty 
in getting environmental permits when it experienced economic 
problems the energy department could not provide new estimates for 
when the project might be completed 
energy international incs underground coal gasification 
project at rawlings wyo has postponed its completion date by 15 
months because the company has been unable to get private financing 
mw kellogg cos advanced coal gasification project proposed 
for new york is nine months off schedule because of problems 
finding buyers for the power the project would generate 
energy and environment research corps gas reburning project 
was delayed for a year because of problems coordinating with 
utilities participating in the project complying with 
environmental requirements and needed costcutting measures 
fultz said hes concerned that the clean coal demonstration 
projects having the most difficulty are the ones in which the 
federal government has agreed to pick up a large share of the costs 
these four projects have the highest rate of federal money 
he said two of them are 50 percent taxpayer backed and the 
other two are 38 percent thats an average of 43 percent to 44 
percent which is far above the overall average of about 30 percent 
to 31 percent 
the government utilities and other private industries are 
sharing the cost of developing new ways of burning coal so the 
plentiful fuel can provide more power with less pollution 
gasses from coalburning power plants help cause both acid rain 
and the greenhouse effect or overall warming of the globe

a used car dealer and a federal employee who 
handled oliver norths expenses were being brought in as witnesses 
to shore up the prosecution claim that north misspent profits from 
arms sales to iran 
the witnesses were summoned to rebut testimony north gave during 
his six days on the witness stand in us district court the last 
of those six days was thursday when the defense rested its case 
the suburban washington used car dealer sold north a heavy duty 
station wagon in 1985 for 8038 under crossexamination from 
prosecutor john keker north said he helped pay for the gmc 
suburban out of a 15000 fund he kept in a metal box bolted to a 
closet floor at his house 
north paid off the 3038 balance on the 8038 vehicle four 
days after making the down payment keker asked north whether he 
got 3000 in cash that day from richard secord whose office is a 
mile or two from the car lot in virginia 
north said he got a lot of money from gen secord on a lot of 
occasions and didnt remember that particular day 
north had enlisted secord to run arms secretly to the contras 
and north replenished a fund kept in an office safe with 150000 
to 200000 in cash from secord a codefendant in the irancontra 
affair 
the prosecution is calling the former national security council 
employee who reimbursed some of norths travel expenses to 
reinforce the charge that north converted to his own use 4300 in 
travelers checks from contra leader adolfo calero 
north maintains he used the checks to reimburse himself for 
outofpocket costs in question are more than 2000 in expenses 
for which north sought reimbursement from the government after 
paying for business trips with travelers checks 
calero gave north travelers checks to help the contras and the 
iran arms initiative and over time 90000 to 100000 from calero 
was funneled through norths office safe 
as norths criminal trial draws to a close his lawyers are 
trying to introduce evidence showing that in all his actions north 
was only doing the bidding of top administration officials 
one document shows that north and cia director william casey met 
at least 26 times and talked by phone on at least 157 occasions 
from jan 3 1984 through nov 24 1986 
the defense also wants to introduce a document showing that 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane was completely in charge 
of responding to a series of questions on norths contra 
activities north is now accused of making false statements in 
connection with those responses which denied he was helping the 
rebels 
the document is a computer note saying that mcfarlane received 
congressional letters and he finally sent them to ollie and asked 
for draft letters mcfarlane made himself the action officer on 
this and i think this is one issue he wants to do his way 
the computer note was written by the nscs legal counsel 
north faces 12 charges including lying to congress and 
obstructing a presidential inquiry

president bush is weighing a visit to poland 
and hungary in july as opportunity beckons for the united states to 
promote political reform and capitalism in eastern europe 
the two countries are at the head of the pack poland in 
recognizing the trade union movement solidarity hungary in raising 
living standards and even permitting a stock exchange to operate 
secretary of state james a baker iii in a speech last month in 
vienna called on the soviet union to scrap the brezhnev doctrine 
that is the principle that moscow has the right to dispatch the red 
army to protect an endangered communist government in any east 
european country 
bakers speech shows the bush administration is not sure soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev is willing to accept radical change 
in eastern europe the soviet invasions of hungary in 1956 and 
czechoslovakia in 1968 were on bakers mind 
but times and the soviet leadership have changed gorbachev is 
determined to improve political and economic conditions at home he 
may want to encourage similar reforms among the east european 
allies 
baker who is starting to feel his way in foreign policy was 
impressed by the reports of reform he received in vienna from the 
foreign ministers of poland and hungary the pace in poland has 
picked up since and bush is preparing to announce on monday a 
major program of economic benefits 
looking for opportunities to make a difference the president 
and the secretary of state hope to encourage further cautious 
applications of american capitalism and westernstyled democracy in 
eastern europe 
it is a policy that is bound to play well in the united states 
one of every eight americans has roots in central and eastern 
europe in many cases the ethnic and cultural affinity is strong 
after the passage of two or three generations conservatives 
especially would like to liberate eastern europe from what they 
call the soviet empire 
symbols are important a bush trip after his summit meeting in 
july with the leaders of britain canada france italy japan and 
west germany could enhance his political standing at home while 
emboldening the east europeans 
president nixon visited poland and romania president carter 
went to poland otherwise us presidents have not been to the six 
countries poland hungary czechoslovakia east germany romania 
and bulgaria allied to the soviet union since world war ii 
the trick in considering highlevel political visits is to 
arrange them in a way that encourages change instead of appearing 
to endorse the local government 
mark palmer the us ambassador to hungary suggests one way is 
to be sure to meet with church and opposition figures as well as 
the party leadership that is what former secretary of state george 
p shultz did in the ukraine and in soviet georgia 
the peoples of eastern and central europe want the kind of 
political institutions taken for granted in the west palmer 
wrote in a recent eastwest forum publication eastern europeans 
want newspapers that print news not propaganda trade unions that 
represent workers not a single political party universities that 
are free to develop ideas and innovation and governments elected 
by the people 
the american diplomat suggested a presidential visit to all six 
countries he said the united states is probably more popular in 
eastern and central europe than in any other part of the world 
but palmer wrote it is up to the peoples of the region to 
insist upon progress toward pluralism and openness 
the united states and other western countries the us 
ambassador said can play a broad and important secondary role with 
diplomatic exchanges and clever private initiatives 
among palmers suggestions 
credits from the international monetary fund the world bank 
and other institutions that are tied to specific reforms 
including sharp cutbacks in the role of ministries the communist 
party and the government in the east european economies 
western investments that encourage a diversification of 
manufacturing and a greater emphasis on consumer goods 
agricultural commodities and tourism 
expanded contact between western and eastern political parties 
and trade unions 
sending 1000 english teachers a year to high schools in 
central and eastern europe and admitting 2000 students from there 
to study annually in the west 
it is time palmer said for the west to perceive this 
region as a new frontier one in which a new level of effort and 
perseverance will yield substantial results in the long term

a cia officer publicly condemned former white 
house aide oliver north for his actions during the irancontra 
affair but the agency says he was not espousing an official cia 
position 
the agency doesnt comment on a current matters in 
litigation said cia spokesman bill devine 
cia officer arthur s hulnick speaking at american university 
on tuesday condemned norths actions and said the covert operation 
should have been handled by the cia 
you shouldnt use a bunch of amateurs to try to carry out a 
covert action when they dont know what theyre doing and that you 
shouldnt use guys at the national security council staff willing 
though they may be because as ollie north admitted the other day 
he wasnt trained for it and we are hulnick said 
following his speech in remarks to an associated press 
reporter hulnick compared norths defense that he was just 
following orders to the defense used by nazi war criminals at the 
nuremberg trials 
i thought we settled this 40 years ago he said 
hulnick said norths defense is also the same one used by army 
lt william calley which didnt wash when the vietnam war officer 
said he had massacred civilians at my lai because he was following 
orders 
devine said hulnick is a fulltime agency officer and the cias 
coordinator for academic affairs but hulnick is not exactly in 
the loop regarding the irancontra affair devine would neither 
confirm nor deny if hulnick is an active case officer 
hes a man with a long career in the agency devine said 
during his speech hulnick said the reagan administrations 
irancontra program was bad policy badly carried out weve 
learned a lesson from that 
hulnick said such covert actions in the bush administration 
would likely be carried out by cia not the nsc 
theres an interesting signal being sent hulnick said 
when the bush administration came into office they selected an 
officer to serve as intelligence manager in the national security 
council staff who is not a covert action guy in fact hes not even 
an agency cia officer 
the appointee is bill working the nscs senior director for 
intelligence programs 
hes a former air force officer whose job on the intelligence 
community staff was to deal with the budget and management what 
this tells me is that the administration is going to be more 
interested in longterm planning to deal with things like the start 
treaty rather than in covert action of some kind or another 
hulnick said

governors can encourage more international 
trade by businesses within their states and should appoint 
toplevel trade czars to give exports a higher priority a 
group of the nations governors said today 
the national governors associations task force on foreign 
markets said in a report that states must develop new links with 
foreign countries if their citizens are to succeed in a future 
economy that will be increasingly dependent on international trade 
while the federal government sets the rules on trade success 
in developing and expanding foreign markets depends on the 
decisions of thousands of corporations and business people said 
virginia gov gerald baliles a democrat and chairman of the 
governors association state governments are positioned to 
help 
the task force of governors which included unsuccessful 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis the threeterm 
governor of massachusetts was releasing the report at a news 
conference today 
the governors have made international trade a focus of their 
gatherings this year in february the governors association 
released a report calling on states to require more international 
instruction in public schools and to offer foreign languages to 
students as early as the first grade 
the report said each state should come up with its own realistic 
and innovative plan for finding new markets and developing new 
products that will be in demand by foreign nations governors can 
elevate foreign trade to a top priority and increase public 
awareness of the connections between their own economy and 
international markets it said 
we can do something about international competition baliles 
said we can develop an export culture we can develop programs 
that identify markets 
the report suggested governors appoint a trade czar an 
official with state cabinetlevel rank who would direct and 
coordinate the state plan for encouraging international trade 
it said state governments should help firms obtain financing for 
export deals either through direct loans and loanguarantee 
programs or by serving as brokers and clearinghouses to match 
commercial lenders with businesses 
the report recommended groups of states consider pooling 
resources for trade and tourism promotion and strengthen cultural 
exchanges with foreign countries 
states and governors have looked for ways to increase 
international trade in recent years and many governors have gone 
on foreign trips to promote trade 
the report cited recent successes in new markets such as the 
sale of mississippi catfish to the soviet union it said virginia 
chicken processors have begun exporting chicken feet once 
discarded as waste to the far east where they are considered a 
delicacy 
business as usual is just not enough the report said as 
the world gets smaller state initiatives must become more 
farreaching

the ruling sandinista party says it 
will build up its defenses in response to congress decision to 
give 50 million in humanitarian aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
the sandinista national liberation front on thursday issued a 
statement after the senate vote saying its members repudiate the 
approval of these new funds by the us congress for the mercenary 
forces 
both houses voted overwhelmingly thursday in favor of the new 
aid 
this has violated one more time the rights and the order of 
international justice and makes fun of the will of the central 
american presidents as expressed in the document of costa del sol 
el salvador on feb 14 the sandinista party said 
the statement referred to an agreement by the presidents of el 
salvador nicaragua guatemala costa rica and honduras to come up 
with a plan by midmay to dismantle the nicaraguan rebel force 
known as the contras 
the statement signed by the fronts nine commanders called the 
humanitarian aid package threats by the us government to apply 
new forms of force against the leftist nicaraguan government 
the sandinista party said it would build up its military 
defense plans taking into account that the war is not over 
despite advances reached in the deepening strategic defeat of the 
mercenary forces 
it also called the contras an instrument of yankee imperialist 
aggression 
an estimated 11000 contra rebels have lived with their families 
in honduran border camps since congress cut off military aid in 
february 1988

after clearing its first two hurdles 
relatively intact president bushs 90 billion plan to bail out 
and reform the savings and loan industry is gaining momentum in 
congress 
the package survived its biggest challenge so far on thursday 
when congressional democrats capitulated to bushs financing 
scheme which is designed to keep the 50 billion taxpayer cost 
from showing up in the federal deficit 
the house banking committees financial institutions 
subcommittee a legislative safehouse for the savings industry in 
the past approved the overall plan after amending it to let sampl 
owners put up less money to stay in business than bush had wanted 
a day earlier the senate banking committee approved the package 
after also weakening but to a lesser degree the capital standards 
that thrifts must meet in the future to qualify for federal deposit 
insurance 
the federal sampl insurance fund is now more than 25 billion in 
the hole because of loans that turned sour and in many cases 
fraudulent lending and accounting practices using 
governmentinsured deposits 
another 50 billion in uncovered loan losses loom just over the 
horizon for 350 more insolvent thrift institutions that the 
government is keeping open now only because it doesnt have the 
money to close or merge them 
the full senate plans to take up the bill monday with the aim of 
passing it wednesday before recessing for passover in the house 
the bill now goes to the full banking committee where bush may win 
back some of the tougher capital and regulatory requirements he 
lost in the subcommittee 
the senate gave bush about 80 to 85 percent of what he wants 
and we gave him 60 to 65 percent said rep charles schumer 
dny a subcommittee member who was on the losing side of a 2423 
vote to cut bushs proposed capital requirements 
by the time its all over he may get 90 to 95 percent of what 
he wants schumer said referring to the 6 that sampl owners would 
have to have in capital for every 100 they lend the same level 
now required of banks 
the subcommittee on an amendment by its chairman rep frank 
annunzio dill and rep stan parris rva voted to keep the 
present requirement 3 in capital for every 100 of lending 
but it also tightened the standards in one significant way by 
saying at least half that amount or 150 for each 100 in loans 
must be in tangible assets or real money that the owners could 
lose 
the administration and congressional auditors have blamed part 
of the sampl crisis on smoke and mirrors accounting practices 
that congress and regulators authorized allowing thrifts to count 
noncash items such as good will and deferred loan losses as 
capital 
the administration is still unhappy with house and senate 
provisions that would permit capitaldeficient thrifts to continue 
growing under its proposal capitalweak institutions would have 
been required to shrink their operations or merge with a healthier 
partner 
its really building the skyscraper on quicksand said l 
william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
which under the bill will have expanded responsibility to insure 
deposits in sampls as well as commercial banks 
the house panel also voted to increase from 50 million to 75 
million the amount bush had requested for the justice department to 
pursue criminal fraud and conspiracy charges against sampl executives 
who loaned or invested deposits illegally 
and it amended bushs plan to allow banks to begin buying up 
both insolvent and healthy thrift institutions immediately in 
deference to small banks and the thrift industry bush had proposed 
allowing banks to buy only ailing sampls for the next two years and 
healthy ones as well after that 
the one question we are repeatedly asked is what are we doing 
to bring more capital into a capitaldeficit industry said rep 
doug barnard dga this is the one thing we can do 
opponents however fear that change will increase taxpayer 
costs because banks will buy only healthy sampls leaving the 
government stuck to pick up all the losses of the insolvent ones 
while the banks won that issue they lost another one to the 
insurance industry the subcommittee voted to declare a 2year 
moratorium on allowing more than 100000 of multimilliondollar 
bank investment certificates to be covered by federal insurance 
in the past two years banks have started using the certificates 
offering fixed interest rates to lure pension plan funds away from 
insurance companies which have no federal deposit insurance 
the real estate industry also won a major victory in both house 
and senate versions through amendments that would require state 
licensing of appraisers that legislation had been stalled for 
years out of fears that real estate brokers would use it to 
monopolize and sharply increase appraisal fees

once the monday deadline for filing 1988 
federal incometax returns passes the average worker still will 
have to toil an additional 17 days before having earned what 
government tax collectors will demand for 1989 
tax freedom day arrives this year on may 4 it has not been 
later since the tax foundation began calculating this measure of 
the burden imposed on workers by federal state and local 
governments it was feb 13 in 1930 
by the foundations calculations the average worker will work 
124 days this year just to pay taxes so if the government 
demanded its money up front it would take all of the average 
workers income through may 4 
that is the same as the last two years in fact it is the same 
as in 1981 when congress and president reagan agreed on the 
biggest tax cut in the nations history 
americans are not better off than they were in 1981 
despite economic growth cuts in income tax rates and repeated 
claims that government spending has been cut to the bone the 
foundation said thursday in announcing tax freedom day 
the reasons 13 federal tax increases enacted since 1981 the 
giant 1986 tax overhaul which to millions of taxpayers took away 
more than it gave social security taxes that have been growing 
more rapidly than the economy and steady state and local tax 
increases caused in part by a reduction in federal aid 
if you prefer worrying about your taxes on the installment plan 
the foundation offers this option the average worker will put in 1 
hour and 46 minutes each 8hour day this year to pay federal taxes 
and another 56 minutes for state and local taxes the federal take 
is down by a minute from 1988 the statelocal burden is unchanged 
the foundation a washingtonbased research organization 
assumes for the purposes of its calculation that all taxes are paid 
by individuals including those collected from corporations 
as the foundation offered its unique look at the tax system 
there were these developments 
the internal revenue service geared up for the last three work 
days of the 1988 returnfiling season promising its tollfree 
telephone system will be open to answer questions saturday morning 
and until 7 pm local time monday irs offices offering advice to 
walkin taxpayers plan extended hours on monday 
the irs earlier projected that 32 million couples and 
individuals out of 109 million expected to file sometime this 
year would wait until the final two weeks of the season 
the deadline this year is monday midnight because the statutory 
deadline april 15 falls on a saturday because monday is a 
holiday patriots day in massachusetts where one of the irss 10 
service centers is located filers in new england and most of new 
york state have until midnight tuesday 
groups opposed to current levels of military spending prepared 
to demonstrate in more than 50 cities in a protest dubbed build 
homes not bombs tax day actions the actions range from urging 
late filers at the post office in milwaukee to attach protest 
stamps to irs envelopes to construction of a cardboard tax 
shelter in santa rosa calif 
the coalition against regressive taxation composed of special 
interests fighting any rise in excise taxes to fight the federal 
deficit released a study indicating that over the past 10 years 
the share of all federal taxes falling on the poor has risen by 12 
percent while the burden on upperincome americans has dropped by 
43 percent the group says this would be worsened by higher taxes 
on gasoline alcohol or tobacco 
the 50 percent of taxpayers considered to have middle income 
between 20000 and 60000 saw a 34 percent rise in their share 
of the burden those with incomes under 20000 constitute 
aboutonethird of the population those over 60000 about

organizers of a convention of newspaper 
editors intended to embarrass israel when they arranged 
backtoback appearances by prime minister yitzhak shamir and a plo 
representative says israels ambassador to the united states 
shamir spoke to the american society of newspaper editors on 
thursday two hours later the asne heard from nabil shaath the 
political adviser to palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat 
shamir had originally been scheduled to appear immediately after 
shaath but organizers rescheduled at the last minute to 
accommodate the israelis desire that shamir and shaath not bump 
into each other said james squires editor of the chicago tribune 
and one of the organizers of the annual meeting 
ambassador moshe arad said squires had failed to inform him 
until this week of the invitation extended to the plo and an 
attempt to put them on the same platform in direct sequence to each 
other reflected an attempt to embarrass us 
arad said he could not imagine that squires had not known 
shaath would appear so closely following shamir still you 
preferred to withhold this information he said i find the 
entire handling of the invitation most inappropriate and 
unethical 
squires insisted that arad was given no misleading 
information about the speaking engagements saying its 
ridiculous for them to dictate to us how we run our meeting 
its none of mr arads business who we choose to invite to 
the asne meeting squires said its exactly the kind of 
absurdity that this middle east conflict is producing

the exxon corp is releasing a 15 million 
down payment for the alaska oil spill in an agreement announced one 
day after interior secretary manuel lujan publicly complained about 
delays 
i am pleased that exxon has acknowledged its longterm 
responsibility to provide not only for the cleanup but for the 
farreaching effects of the spill lujan said thursday when the 
agreement was announced 
the up front money is to help assess the environmental 
damage caused by the exxon valdez oil spill and plan for a recovery 
on wednesday lujan had complained that exxon was not moving as 
fast as he would like in providing the money he said government 
and exxon attorneys had been negotiating for 10 days without an 
agreement 
but the department announced late thursday that the oil company 
had earlier in the day agreed on procedures for transferring the 
15 million to the government with about half of that immediately 
to be distributed to four federal agencies already working in 
alaska 
the government has said it wants the 15 million in advance so 
authorities including the state of alaska can develop a longterm 
recovery plan and assess the extent of damage along alaskas 
southern coast to wildlife waterfowl fish and public lands 
lujan has said that eventually these costs separate from the 
direct cleanup costs are likely to be in the tens of millions 
of dollars 
lujan said he considers the money an initial step in exxon 
paying for the environmental damages caused by one of its tankers 
when the vessel ran aground in prince william sound spilling more 
than 10 million gallons of oil into the pristine waters 
exxon spokesmen said in response to lujans complaints that they 
were perplexed by his remarks the spokesmen said the oil company 
all along has been willing to provide the money although 
procedures had to be worked out

here are excerpts from house speaker jim 
wrights statement thursday as he defended himself against ethics 
charges 
it appears from news accounts that the committee on standards of 
official conduct has made a decision that there may be some reason 
to believe that i in my personal business dealings could have 
violated some rules of the house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i have asked the committee for the opportunity to appear to 
answer every question they may wish to ask and to demonstrate that 
there is clear and convincing proof that i have not violated those 
rules of the house 
i am confident that in the 34 years ive served in the congress 
i have not violated any of those basic rules nor any commonly 
accepted standard of ethical conduct 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i think i am the most fortunate of men to have been privileged 
to serve in this institution 
and certainly under no circumstances would i knowingly or 
intentionally violate any of its rules 
and i am convinced that i can demonstrate that to the 
satisfaction of the committee or of any other reasonable person 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
im not accused of any personal immorality or of any dishonesty 
or of misusing tax dollars 
were dealing here with three issues concerning my personal 
finances and the technical reporting requirements of the congress 
 
questions concern whether my wifes employment at a salary 
of 18000 a year for a small corporation in which we provided 
half the capitalization and owned half the stock was truly and 
properly employment or whether it was some concealed gift 
the second question involves whether or not my business partner 
george mallick had a direct interest in legislation as defined 
under the rules of the house 
and the third question involves whether royalties that i 
received from a book that i wrote were properly received as 
royalties or whether they actually should have been reported in 
some other way as a gift or an honorarium 
i am prepared to demonstrate that in each of these instances no 
rule has been violated 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i must say that i do find that personally offensive for anyone 
to suggest that my wife betty did not perform services worth 
18000 
it is quite interesting to observe i believe that both before 
and after the few years that she worked for our small investment 
corporation betty made considerably more money than the 18000 a 
year that she accepted from the corporation for serving it in many 
many capacities

those who are married to people in public office in the 
congress are entitled to lives of their own 
perhaps half of the wives of members of congress spouses of 
members of congress are engaged or employed in a professional or 
business relationship on their own 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i want to say to you that my wife is a good decent caring 
thoroughly honorable person 
ill damned well fight to protect her honor and her integrity 
against any challenge by any source whatever the cost 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ive known mr mallick and hes been a personal friend of mine 
for the better part of 30 years more than a quarter of a century 
in all the years that ive known him he has never once asked me 
to intercede in his behalf with any branch of government any 
agency of government to do anything for him personally in my 
official capacity 
not one time has he ever asked me to vote for or against any 
piece of legislation any provision of law any amendment 
it just never has happened not one single time 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i have not received gifts of the type forbidden from mr mallick 
and even if i had they would not be forbidden because he has 
never had a special interest in legislation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
now the third question involves the publishing of books that i 
wrote a little book called reflections of a public man 
i have written other books that have been published and i got 
advance payments for the other books and relatively smaller 
royalties 
but the rules of the house do not stipulate what size royalty 
you should get 
the rules clearly exempt royalty income from books from the 
outside earning limitations that are imposed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ive abided by the rules 
i have been interested in a widespread distribution of the book 
yes 
i want people to buy the book yes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it has been suggested that because one or more organizations to 
which i had made a speech had seen fit to purchase copies of the 
book distribute them among their members or students or others 
that therefore i was trying to avoid the outside earning 
limitations imposed on honoraria and actually was receiving a 
honorarium for the speech 
well that was never my intention 
i never asked anybody to buy books in exchange for my making a 
speech 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ive reported my wifes source of income ive reported every 
penny of income that i made from the sale of the books and from the 
corporation in which we own half interest 
the question involves whether i should have reported them in one 
column or in another column 
and i believe i reported them in the right column 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i am 66 years of age 
sixtysix years of living and giving striving and sometimes 
failing and sometimes succeeding treating my fellow man with 
decency and dignity and respect i believe have earned me a 
reputation as a person of decency and as a person of honor and as 
a person of integrity 
i know that my wife deserves to be known in that way and that 
to me is the most important thing and the only really important 
thing and for my good name which is the legacy i intend to leave 
my children and my grandchildren 
i will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that i 
possess

the spread of aidsvirus infections in the united 
states could trigger dramatic increases in tuberculosis cases 
according to federal health officials 
the national centers for disease control responding to an 
increasing link between aids and tuberculosis urged doctors 
thursday to give tb tests to patients infected with the aids virus 
and to make aids testing available to tb patients 
the number of the nations 20000 annual tuberculosis patients 
who are also infected with the aids virus is unknown but one study 
cited by the cdc matching reported tb cases with aids cases in 43 
states found that 4 percent of aids patients also were listed as 
tb patients 
the cdc also reported thursday that the focus of aids in the 
united states is shifting away from the northeast as more and more 
cases are showing up in smaller cities 
only 32 percent of the nations aids cases in 1988 were reported 
from new york new jersey and pennsylvania compared with 54 
percent four years earlier 
its moving outside of the major metropolitan areas and 
outside the northeast said cdc aids specialist dr jeannette 
stehrgreen noting that the proportion of cases in urban areas 
under 500000 population increased from 12 percent in pre1986 
years to 19 percent in 1988 
tuberculosis is one of a number of opportunistic infections 
which can prey on the weakened immune systems of aids patients and 
can serve as an early indicator of the disease 
but tuberculosis is one of the few infections associated with 
hiv thats transmissible by the airborne route so there are 
public health implications here said dr carol a ciesielski a 
cdc tuberculosis specialist 
the cdc in a report from its advisory committee for the 
elimination of tuberculosis said all patients diagnosed with 
tuberculosis should be offered aids testing and counseling 
likewise aidsinfected persons should be given tuberculosis tests 
the reason ciesielski said is that tb unlike many infections 
that can plague aids patients is curable and preventable by 
testing early you can give them medicine to prevent them 
developing it preventing a new case from occurring 
tuberculosis a bacterial infection of the lungs can be cured 
or prevented in most cases with drugs studies have suggested that 
a latent infection with tb bacteria may often progress to 
clinical tb early in the course of a persons infection with the 
aids virus the cdc said 
in some areas the link between tb and aids can be high a 
florida study found that 10 percent of aids patients were also tb 
patients a study at a new jersey hospital found a connection in 21 
percent the cdc said 
minority populations in some highaids areas have been at 
particular risk of aidsassociated tb the cdc said studies in 
new york city florida and newark nj found that blacks and 
hispanics accounted for more than 80 percent of the tbaids cases 
in its report thursday on the eight years since aids was first 
reported the cdc said the rate of increase in the number of 
documented aids cases has declined 
the number of aids cases as compared with the year before shot 
up 215 percent between 1982 and 1983 since then the increase has 
slowed up 117 percent in 1984 84 percent in 1985 60 percent in 
1986 60 percent again in 1987 and 34 percent last year when 
32311 cases were reported said stehrgreen chief of the cdcs 
aids reporting and analysis section 
in the latest monthly count from the cdc the nation has 
reported 90990 aids cases and 52435 of those patients or 58 
percent have died

a suspected member of a drugsmuggling 
cult was forced to dig up the remains of the 13th victim of revenge 
and sacrificial killings as public officials decried the 
massacre 
authorities are looking for the sects alleged ringleader 
adolfo de jesus constanzo whom members called godfather the 
five men in custody said constanzo 26 and sara maria aldrete 24 
called the witch believed human sacrifices protected the cult 
from harm 
cameron county sheriffs lt george gavito in texas said that 
constanzo a cuban who has contacts in miami was last seen in 
brownsville 
in matamoros city council members and civic leaders issued a 
declaration against drug trafficking on thursday that said 
those connected to the massacre who poisoned the public should be 
prosecuted 
state attorney general anibal perez vargas talked with matamoros 
authorities then said we will not rest until we uncover all the 
vermin that use legal activities as a front to break the law 
using a pick and shovel and his hands sergio martinez 22 dug 
alone for more than an hour thursday afternoon to uncover the body 
on the ranch near matamoros where authorities unearthed a dozen 
bodies tuesday including that of university of texas student mark 
kilroy 
martinez turned to police at one point and asked to be allowed 
to rest and then asked for a tractor to dig the hole come on 
use your hands policemen yelled at him 
the 13th victim about 30 years old had a rectangular cut over 
the left side of his chest which showed signs that his heart had 
been ripped from his body authorities said 
federal judicial police commander juan benitez ayala said they 
fear there are more bodies to be found 
one investigator said some bloodstained childrens clothing has 
been found at ms aldretes house but they have received no 
reports of missing children 
helen kilroy the mother of mark kilroy asked 1200 people at a 
mass in brownsville on thursday to pray for the dead and the men 
who killed them 
pray for the people who have done these things mrs kilroy 
said at st lukes catholic churh pray that they are caught and 
that the lord will enter their hearts and they will know what they 
have done is wrong 
in a dramatic public confession wednesday some of the five men 
in custody were paraded onto a balcony where they told reporters 
the slayings were intended to provide a magical shield for 
members of a drugsmuggling ring 
a cauldron with a turtle brains and other items were found near 
the graves at the ranch along with bowls containing burned goats 
heads and a mutilated rooster 
so far the only victim to be publicly identified was kilroy 
who was abducted from the streets of matamoros last month during 
spring break 
the search for constanzo has been focused on the miami area 
where his family lived in a middleclass neighborhood in the late 
1970s and early 1980s authorities said 
those who know ms aldrete say her alleged ties to the sect have 
taken them by surprise 
apparently sara was leading a double life as a witch in 
mexico and as a deans honor roll student at texas southmost 
college said cameron county sheriffs deputy carlos tapia in 
texas 
texas southmost college is a twoyear college in brownsville 
with an enrollment of 6500 
a search of her home in matamoros revealed an altar and 
bloodspatters but no bones or bodies gavito said 
the bodies of the victims were at funeral homes pending 
identification authorities said 
officials said the sect was shipping more than a ton of 
marijuana to the united states each week and that us 
investigators are helping mexican authorities in the investigation

the major bribery scandal shaking the japanese 
government widened further today as the countrys second most 
powerful leader admitted his wife was paid about 60000 by recruit 
co 
shintaro abe secretary general of the governing liberal 
democratic party acknowledged earlier news reports that recruit 
co paid his wife yoko about 2300 monthly as a consulting fee 
from february 1986 to august 1988 
i put my secretary entirely in charge of my fundraising 
affairs and neither my wife nor myself knew anything about it 
said abe in a news conference this morning but i have found such 
a deal took place and i admit it was a result of my ignorance 
abe refused to give any further details he said the fees 
totaling about 60000 were deposited into a bank account of his 
secretary who has been sick and hospitalized 
abe the second most powerful liberal democrat after takeshita 
was foreign minister and secretary general of the party when his 
wife was paid the money his disclosure followed statements by 
takeshita in parliament tuesday that he received about 1 million 
from recruit an information services conglomerate 
both abe and takeshita are among 17 politicians and about 150 
other influential people known to have bought at discount prices 
hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a subsidiary of recruit 
transactions that generated substantial profits when the share 
price soared after overthecounter trading began 
the stock transactions were not considered illegal but recruit 
also paid hundreds of millions of yen to dozens of influential 
politicians as political contributions raising suspicions that it 
was seeking favors in return 
so far 14 people including two former vice ministers and an 
exchairman of nippon telegraph and telephone corp hisashi 
shinto have been arrested on charges of bribery and securities law 
violations in connection with the affair and three cabinet 
ministers including former finance minister kiichi miyazawa have 
been forced to resign due to their links to the scandal 
todays disclosure showed abe continued to receive funds from 
recruit even after the scandal surfaced last summer and 
contradicted a declaration by the liberal democratic party earlier 
this year that no members of the current takeshita administration 
received donations from recruit after last summer 
opposition parties which are stalemating parliamentary debate 
on the national budget for the fiscal year that began april 1 
quickly stepped up their criticism of takeshita and his 
administration 
how can he not know about the deposits said yukihisa 
yoshida a official of the democratic socialist party a major 
opposition group it is extremely serious that he was receiving 
money even after the recruit scandal surfaced 
shun ohide a official of the japan socialist party the largest 
opposition group said abe has been reported to be closely 
linked to recruit and i think it todays revelation was only part 
of it after all these revelations the liberal democratic party 
should resign 
despite media surveys showing his public support rate has 
dropped below 10 percent to 78 percent in a poll by the 
nationwide television network tvasahi takeshita has refused 
calls for his resignation vowing to carry out political reforms 
and restore public trust in his administration

a man suspected of leading a cult that performed 
human sacrifices on a mexican ranch was exposed to secretive 
afrocaribbean religions that ritually slaughter animals and rely 
on magic 
but a santeria priest and others familiar with the practices of 
santeria voodoo and other obscure religions likened the mexican 
drugsmuggling cult more to the mass suicide in jonestown led by 
jim jones 
at least 13 bodies have been found this week in shallow graves 
in matamoros mexico suspects in the slayings have said they 
killed at the demand of adolfo de jesus constanzo whom they called 
godfather 
they said constanzo 26 and sara maria aldrete 24 called the 
witch believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult 
protection from harm and helped them in a drugsmuggling operation 
constanzo a cubanamerican who grew up in suburban miami is 
still being sought 
hes had some sort of exposure to santeria i wouldnt deny 
that but i wouldnt say hes a santeria priest said willie 
ramos of miami a santeria high priest 
santeria is a largely underground religion that melded the 
beliefs of slaves from presentday nigeria with hispanic culture in 
the caribbean and parts of south america 
lets compare it to jonestown in the sense that the guy in 
jonestown was deranged and demented he got all these people to 
follow him to the extent that he got these people killed ramos 
said 
human sacrifice has never been practiced in the approximately 
400 years that the afrocaribbean cults have survived in the new 
world he said 
mercedes sandoval a professor at miamidade community college 
who has studied santeria for nearly 40 years said religious 
beliefs could not be blamed for the slayings 
it was not the religion that got them into drugs it was the 
drug dealing that led them to try to get protection through 
religion ms sandoval said 
dr charles wetli dade county deputy chief medical examiner who 
has studied the religions for a decade as part of his work agreed 
with ms sandoval 
the drugsmuggling activities and the homicides are totally 
unrelated to the religion wetli said if youre a drug 
smuggler you can pray to some of these gods to help you with your 
drug smuggling 
blood from santeria animal sacrifices can form an alliance with 
gods of nature and protect the believers a reason offered by 
mexican authorities as a motive for the killings at the ranch 
across the border from brownsville texas ms sandoval said 
constanzo probably was seeking assistance from magical systems 
to get protection and then he himself developed his own ritual 
ms sandoval estimated as many as 25000 people in south florida 
are regular santeria followers and they also can be found in new 
york new jersey california venezuela colombia and spain 
constanzos family which lived in a middleclass neighborhood 
west of miami until 1984 left headless chickens geese and goats 
animals used in santeria rituals on doorsteps and street corners 
said neighbors 
ms sandoval said symbols of santeria were present in the farm 
shack where investigators believe the victims were killed but 
television pictures also revealed human skulls commonly used in the 
practice of palo mayombe 
palo mayombe with origins in congo uses human skulls in its 
rituals but ms sandoval and wetli said they are obtained through 
medical supply stores from medical school students and only 
occasionally through grave robbing 
i think what we have here is a case of some very sociopathic 
people that may have been exposed to santeria or some other 
magical system ms sandoval said i think we are dealing with 
a deranged person 
former neighbors recalled the constanzos as santeria followers 
and referred to constanzos mother as a witch 
norma brito who bought the constanzos house after a bank 
foreclosed on it in 1984 said she found the remains of an altar 
with candles wax and fruit when she moved in

the ritualistic killings of at least 
13 people in matamoros and the recent slayings of 12 in this 
usmexican border town are linked only by drugs not cults an 
authority said 
police this week were investigating the discovery of at least 13 
bodies in shallow graves in matamoros just south of brownsville 
texas suspects in the slayings have said they killed at the demand 
of adolfo de jesus constanzo whom they called godfather they 
said constanzo 26 and sara maria aldrete 24 called the 
witch believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult 
protection from harm and helped them in a drugsmuggling operation 
earlier this month authorities in agua prieta discovered the 
bodies of three women and nine men in a bloodsplattered well and a 
limetreated spectic tank on an abandoned ranch about 1000 yards 
from the us border police said the killings were believed to be 
drug related 
there is a special motive involved in the agua prieta case 
which has nothing to do with voodoo or witchcraft or religion or 
satanism pima county sheriff clarence dupnik said in tucson 
ariz on thursday the mutilation of the bodies in my judgment 
the killings were torture killings as a result of retaliation a 
squabble amongst dopers 
dupnik would not elaborate on the motive but it has nothing 
to do with cults or religion or satanism

some countries now support the 
vietnamesebacked government in cambodia a change that poses the 
greatest danger to our nation cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk said 
a text of the princes statement seen today in bangkok was 
made wednesday during a cambodian new years day message over 
resistance radio 
sihanouk leads a threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting 
vietnamese forces that invaded cambodia in 1978 and installed an 
allied government in phnom penh vietnam announced last week it 
will withdraw its remaining 50000 troops by sept 30 and asked 
other countries to abide by pledges to stop aiding the guerrillas 
the occupation of cambodia by vietnam has been along with the 
soviet presence in afghanistan one of the major eastwest issues 
china had vowed not to improve relations with moscow until the 
vietnamese left cambodia and vietnams own efforts to obtain aid 
and recognition from the united states in the aftermath of the 
vietnam war were frustrated by washingtons insistence that hanoi 
withdraw its troops from cambodia first 
the prince previously has criticized thailand which gives 
sanctuary to his guerrillas for hosting cambodian prime minister 
hun sen for an unprecedented visit to thailand in january 
sihanouks son prince norodom ranariddh said recently that he 
was saddened because thailand and its allies in the association of 
southeast asian nations have lessened their oncefirm support for 
key resistance proposals on ending the war 
in the broadcast sihanouk said some foreigners governments 
and some major newspapers of the western world have currently 
changed their attitude to wanting to embrace vietnams colonialism 
and the heng samrin government in phnom penh this poses the 
greatest danger to our nation 
these groups the prince said are doing what they can to make 
us remain vietnams slaves all our lives 
some governments and groups have been kept a distance from the 
resistance because of sihanouks alliance in the guerrilla 
coalition with the fanatical communist khmer rouge the khmer rouge 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in cambodia before vietnams 
invasion toppled it with 3000040000 troops it is the mightiest 
of the guerrilla groups 
apparently in response to this sihanouk said we do not need 
to love the khmer rouge however if we do not fight within this 
tripartite framework it is impossible because we need to have 
strength and unity among the three parties to fight the vietnamese 
enemies 
sihanouk is to meet with hun sen prime minister of the phnom 
penh government next month in indonesia for their fourth round of 
bilateral peace talks 
in the broadcast sihanouk said he agreed to the meeting because 
otherwise he would be accused of blocking the peace process and 
because french government emissaries told him on march 26 that hun 
sen had two concessions to make the prince said he did not yet 
know what these concessions were

a citizens group says it plans to challenge 
the nuclear regulatory commissions decision permitting the 
operator of the three mile island nuclear plant to boil away 23 
million gallons of radioactive water 
some of the water is left over from the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident which occurred at the middletown pa 
plant on march 28 1979 
in a 50 vote the commission on thursday upheld a february 
decision of its atomic safety and licensing board which concluded 
that the evaporation plan will have extremely small radiation 
exposure consequences both to workers and the general public 
however a citizens group based near the plant said it would 
continue to fight the plan 
frances skolnick of the susquehanna valley alliance said the 
decision isnt unexpected 
it enables us to go outside of the nuclear regulatory 
commission and to the courts she said we will definitely seek 
relief 
she said it had not decided where the challenge would be filed 
the alliance joined a second group three mile island alert as 
an intervenor in the nrcs review of the matter last year the 
groups had asked general public utilities nuclear the plant 
operator to consider other alternatives including storing the 
water in tanks for perhaps 30 years to allow radiation to decay 
but the licensing board which studied the issue on behalf of 
the commissioners found on feb 3 that the storage plan is not 
obviously superior to the evaporation proposal 
the nrc vote clears the way for issuing an amendment to the 
plants operating license permitting gpu nuclear to begin 
evaporating the water the amendment is to be issued by the 
commission staff but nrc spokesman john kopeck said he did not 
know when 
about 260000 gallons of water was contaminated in the plants 
unit 2 reactor building basement as the result of the 1979 
accident the rest of the water was used in cleanup operations 
afterward 
gpu nuclear proposed to dispose of the water by boiling it into 
steam released from a 100foothigh stack and packaging impurities 
for shipment to a lowlevel radioactive waste dump 
last spring gpu nuclear raised eyebrows among local citizens by 
spending 800000 on the evaporation system even before the 
licensing board had held hearings to decide whether the system 
could be used 
the 7 million evaporation process is part of the 1 billion 
cleanup of unit 2 during the accident uranium fuel was allowed to 
lose the vital cooling water that normally covers it causing 
material in the radioactive core to melt

the social security administration will stop 
verifying citizens social security numbers for credit bureaus and 
financial institutions because of a recent supreme court ruling on 
the privacy of government records 
commissioner dorcas r hardy announced the decision late 
thursday days after a senator called the verification practice for 
private businesses the largest breach of privacy in the history 
of the program 
the social security administration takes very seriously its 
important responsibility of protecting the privacy of the records 
it maintains on over 200 million americans hardy said in 
announcing the change 
she said a supreme court decision march 22 significantly 
narrowed the circumstances under which information on individuals 
can be released under that 90 decision the court said the fbi 
may withhold its rap sheets on 24 million americans from public 
disclosure 
the move will stop the ssa from verifying 140 million names and 
social security submitted by trw credit data hardy said the firm 
made the huge request last year prompting hardy to order a review 
of the legal status of the release of such information 
sen david h pryor dark who raised the issue monday at a 
hearing of the senate committee on aging hailed the decision but 
he told the washington post this action comes too late to 
protect some 150000 people whose files were violated during a test 
run conducted for trw and for more than 3 million people on whom 
verifications were conducted for citibank and other firms in past 
years 
pryor this week wrote secretary of health and human services 
secretary louis w sullivan to investigate verifications by trw and 
citicorp pryor had called them the largest breach of privacy in 
the history of the program 
since the late 1970s social security has routinely performed 
negative verifications by telling businesses upon request 
whether a name and social security do not match it would not say 
whether a name and number match 
no other information such as wages and benefits was given 
without the individual persons permission and the agency would 
not grant requests for a persons social security number 
the verifications were made under an interpretation of the 
freedom of information act 
the agency will continue to verify social security numbers for 
employers who must have the correct numbers for workers hardy said

maronite catholics are locked in a 
civil war with their moslem countrymen in lebanon but they live in 
peace with moslem neighbors on this mediterranean island itself 
divided by another war 
yet both maronite communities are struggling for survival 
those in lebanon against political domination by syrianbacked 
forces and their brethren in cyprus against shrinking numbers 
cyprus lies only 100 miles northwest of lebanon where a civil 
war between christians and moslems has raged for 14 years 
some 5000 maronites live in cyprus divided since 1974 when the 
turkish army invaded in the wake of a shortlived coup by 
supporters of union with greece 
only 350 maronites still live in northern cyprus controlled by 
turkey and largely populated by moslem turkish cypriots 
clustered in four villages on the northwestern tip of the 
island the community is dwindling as young people move to the more 
prosperous greek cypriot sector in the south which is mainly 
christian 
as the community in kormakiti asomados karpacha and ayia 
marina dwindles so does the culture their ancestors first brought 
to cyprus 900 years ago when they fled moslem persecution in syria 
and parts of lebanon 
the main maronite sect named after the 5th century monk st 
maroun whose monastery in syria was destroyed in 938 ad by 
moslem invaders lived in the mountains 
the new generation is going to greek cypriot schools and they 
dont speak arabic only the old people speak arabic now said 
archbishop butros gemayel a relative of former lebanese president 
amin gemayel 
he was elected last june in lebanon and is the first 
cyprusbased maronite archbishop in 300 years 
the maronites have remained neutral in the conflict between the 
islands turks and greeks and are the only people outside the 
united nations peacekeeping force allowed to cross the islands 
dividing green line unhindered once a month 
we have nothing against the turks we saved many turkish lives 
during the war said john mavrides the parliamentary 
representative of the maronite community 
special sentiments link us to lebanon but the people of 
kormakiti are the only ones who still speak some arabic said 
mavrides 
kormakati population 230 is the main maronite village 22 
miles northwest of the capital nicosia 
it has a school with 18 pupils under age 10 a church run by 
94yearold father antonios terzi and the lebanon cafe but no 
hospital 
the sick have to go to kyrenia or nicosia but if its very 
serious we call the doctor from a nearby turkish cypriot 
village said amida hannarusso who runs kormakitis only cafe 
in the 16th century 80000 maronites lived in 70 villages in 
cyprus but like other groups on the island they suffered 
persecution and massacres by the various invaders including the 
moslem turks 
they survived but when the turks invaded in 1974 many of the 
young people moved south with 200000 greek cypriots who either 
fled or were expelled by the invaders some 70000 turkish cypriots 
fled north 
most of the maronites remaining in the north are old people who 
mainly work the land 
the greek cypriot authorities send food supplies twice a month 
to the maronite villages and provide free education for maronite 
children whose parents live in the north maronites in the greek 
cyriot sector also provide financial assistance 
those who moved south have largely integrated scattered over 
the greek sector rather than living in exclusively maronite 
neighborhoods 
valentino piribitsi a maronite born in cyprus three years 
before the turkish invasion said were all cypriots 
piribitsi has lived in nicosia since his parents left kormakiti 
in 1980 so he and his sister could attend a christian secondary 
school 
however another young maronite kyriakos who declined to give 
his family name said he feels his brethren are discriminated 
against by the greek cypriots who are mainly greek orthodox 
if a maronite and a greek cypriot with the same qualifications 
apply for a job the greek cypriot would be chosen in most cases 
said kyriakos 22 
gemayel acknowledged his community now faces an identity 
crisis in cyprus 
the maronite link with lebanon is still strong because thats 
where their roots are thats the religious center he said 
but if the island was reunited and the cypriot national identity 
becomes stronger than loyalty to the community the maronites 
longing for lebanon will only be religious rather than ethnic 
he lamented 
kyriakos noted i dont care much about lebanon like the 
older generation does i dont identify with the lebanese im 
cypriot

two graduate students says they detected 
indications of cold fusion in an experiment they conducted with 
heavy water while georgia tech researchers now are saying their 
own results may have been flawed 
van l eden and wei liu physics students at the university of 
washington said thursday they failed to duplicate exactly the 
highly publicized experiment by university of utah chemist b 
stanley pons and martin fleischmann of englands university of 
southampton but they did get indications fusion may have taken 
place in their experiment last week 
pons and fleischmann said they apparently produced nuclear 
fusion in a tabletop experiment using ordinary lab equipment 
meanwhile georgia tech researchers disclosed on thursday their 
experiment may have been skewed by inaccuracies in a key piece of 
equipment that measured an emission of neutrons a sure sign of 
fusion the researchers said their probe may give false readings 
caused by heat at low temperatures 
its not as sure a thing as it was senior researcher james 
mahaffey said in atlanta it seemed like a sure thing now im 
getting nervous 
mahaffey said the experiment would be run again to determine if 
the equipment caused error in the projects results 
he acknowledged that mondays announcement of success might have 
been premature 
normally a nuclear fusion reaction requires extreme 
temperatures and pressures fusion at low temperatures socalled 
cold fusion could mean a cheap clean and nearly inexhaustible 
power source 
the georgia tech experiment and another announced monday by 
researchers at texas aampm appeared to confirm a march 23 reaction 
obtained by pons and fleischmann 
in eden and lius experiment a mass spectrometer detected a 
possible indicator of tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
commonly produced in fusion reactions 
the indicator was found when the experiment was run using 
deuterium a hydrogen isotope and component of deuterium oxide or 
heavy water eden said the indicator was not detected when the test 
was repeated with ordinary water 
both researchers cautioned that the results were preliminary and 
needed review by other scientists they also said they had not 
ruled out other explanations for what they observed 
we knew we had seen something that was exciting eden said 
it is open to alternative interpretation there is no question 
about that 
eden he and liu put together the experiment with existing lab 
equipment metals in stock and some heavy water sitting around 
the lab 
he said their major outofpocket expense was for about three 
pizzas bought by liu

afghanistans ambassador to india 
speaking on the first anniversary of the geneva accord that led to 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from his country accused the 
united states today of ignoring the spirit and the letter of 
the unsponsored agreement 
the geneva accord is fully implemented by afghanistan and the 
soviet union but unfortunately the other parties concerned have 
not implemented it and the situation has gotten more tense than 
ever before abdul samad azhar told reporters 
he repeated his governments accusations that the united states 
and pakistan were continuing to arm moslem guerrillas who have 
trying the past decade to overthrow the sovietstyle party that 
took power by coup and assassination in 1978 
afghanistan and pakistan pledged in the geneva accord not to 
interfere in each others internal affairs the soviet union whose 
troops fought alongside afghan government troops against the 
guerrillas for nine years and the united states one of the 
guerrillas staunchest backers signed as guarantors 
under the accord moscow withdrew its 115000 soldiers from 
afghanistan in phases the last soviet soldier left afghanistan on 
feb 15 
the soviets continue to supply president najibs army with 
weapons including longrange scudb missiles now used by 
government troops against the guerrillas besieging the strategic 
eastern city of jalalabad 
the soviet union fully implemented the accord they withdrew 
their troops azhar said but the other side the united states 
of america did not respect the letter and spirit they are 
continuing supplying weapons to the rebels every day more 
sophisticated weapons are being supplied 
asked what these weapons were the ambassador listed 
antiaircraft stinger missiles and surfacetosurface missiles that 
he said had ranges of 18 to 50 miles 
azhar also criticized the slowness with which foreign aid is 
arriving for the reconstruction of his country a year ago he 
said there had been talk of an international program similar to 
the marshall plan for europe after the devastation of world war ii 
unfortunately in practice we see a marshall plan for the 
destruction of afghanistan not the reconstruction the 
ambassador said 
western nations have been reluctant to send aid that could help 
prolong the longevity of the najib government in addition with 
civil war raging throughout much of afghanistan relief agencies of 
the united nations and other international groups say they are 
hamstrung in operating outside kabul 
the ambassador reiterated his governments position that it was 
willing to call new elections under un supervision the 
mujahedeen guerrillas whose name means islamic holy warriors have 
refused to participate in any election while najib and his peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan remains in power

a proposal to place video surveillance 
cameras on bridges leading to their ritzy island is winning support 
from residents despite warnings it would focus a spotlight on the 
towns elitist image 
more than 40 residents turned out in support of the plan to 
record every car truck bicycle and pedestrian heading to the 
island when it was discussed wednesday by the public safety 
committee 
but others recalled negative national publicity the town 
received about a law requiring bluecollar workers to carry 
identification cards declared unconstitutional by a federal judge 
in 1985 
this type of situation might work against us in our public 
image phillip radlauer said weve been taking a terrible 
beating as an elitist community 
robert oreck a landlord proposed the plan to increase security 
lets put the criminals on notice palm beach florida is 
not the place to ply their trade oreck said 
town attorney john randolph said the plan does not appear to be 
unconstitutional 
there is no expectation of privacy in ones use of a public 
street he said 
security concerns have been heightened after a woman from nearby 
lake worth was killed feb 6 and her body was dumped in the road 
next to the bath amp tennis club 
proponents of the plan also cited the case of mark baltes who 
was run over and killed in 1986 by a car driven by a man who lived 
in west palm beach 
under the plan police officers would review tapes made during a 
specified period before and after a crime 
the committee sent the proposal to the town council which meets 
monday

a bored firefighter who jokingly told two 
teenagers calling the station to set a fire must pay for the 
damage to a vacant house which the youths subsequently torched a 
judge has ruled 
barry scott mcdonald 21 was found guilty of storefront burning 
and ordered to pay for the 1630 damage the blaze did to the 
houses front porch 
under maryland law someone who incites such a crime can be 
punished the same way as the person who commits it 
apparently they the teenagers knew some of the guys at the 
station and were joking back and forth people in the background 
were shouting addresses and places to set fires mcdonalds 
attorney barry diamond said thursday in recounting the telephone 
call 
but the kid who actually set the fire pointed his finger at my 
client he said 
in anne arundel county circuit court on tuesday diamond told 
judge bruce c williams that the july 31 call to the orchard beach 
fire station came on a night when the firefighters on duty 
including mcdonald had nothing to do 
soon after the fire department was called to a fire at an 
abandoned house a few blocks away 
mcdonald thought the teens could tell he was kidding diamond 
said 
but mcdonald told colleagues after the fire was reported see 
i told you he would do it assistant states attorney philip 
caroom said 
mcdonald a volunteer with the 45member company since 1985 was 
suspended from firefighting duties after the blaze said company 
chief walt snyder 
both mcdonald and the teenagers live in orchard beach a tiny 
community about 10 miles south of baltimore 
williams sentenced mcdonald to probation before judgment which 
allows him to keep a clean criminal record if he completes his 
three years of probation without incident 
he also will have to pay court costs and perform 50 hours of 
community service although he is barred from taking part in any 
firefighting work 
the names of the teenagers and the status of their cases were 
withheld because of juvenile court confidentiality rules however 
caroom said they were ordered along with mcdonald to pay for damage 
to the house 
storefront burning refers to arson at an unoccupied building 
under maryland law it is less serious than arson but still carries 
a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison 
i would say hes extremely lucky that the kids did select an 
unoccupied structure and that there was minimal damage done to 
it caroom said

the us drug enforcement administration has 
reduced its operations in perus cocaineproducing jungle for 
security reasons us officials said 
the cutback began two months ago after the security chief of the 
us embassy received a minor leg wound in january by gunmen firing 
at a us helicopter from the ground said embassy spokesman 
charles loveridge 
the violence occurred in the upper huallaga valley near tingo 
maria 240 miles northeast of lima officials say more than 60 
percent of the worlds coca the raw material of cocaine is grown 
in the region 
operation snowcap under which dea agents advise perus civil 
guard on eradicating coca fields and cocaineproducing 
laboratories was suspended in midfebruary said catherine shaw of 
the departments office of international narcotics matters in 
washington 
theyre regrouping looking for ways to make the base camp 
more secure she said 
the united states has been slowly building up its antidrug 
force in the region the last two years but violence stemming from 
an alliance between drug traffickers and maoist shining path 
guerrillas has recently increased security risks us officials 
said 
loveridge said the united states was temporarily halting its 
coca eradication program and interdiction efforts to allow time to 
analyze the effectiveness of the antidrug effort 
he declined to say exactly how many us officials have been 
withdrawn but said about 12 still are stationed in the region 
it certainly is not an end to our efforts we will be out 
there and fighting drugs for a long time to come loveridge said 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty said in washington the 
decision does not mean a reduction in the number of us agents in 
peru only a reassignment 
there are other kinds of work that can be done down there 
such as intelligence that sort of thing he said 
loveridge said construction is continuing on a fortified 
helicopter base near tingo maria and us agents are continuing to 
train and advise peruvian police in antidrug operations 
nine us helicopters rented from private companies and loaned 
to the peruvian government are still in operation in the region 
loveridge said 
ms shaw who said she was not aware of any particular threats 
against the agents added there have been over the years many 
threats against the eradication workers

thousands of sinhalese in the port of 
trincomalee took refuge in a navy dockyard today after 41 people 
were killed in a car bombing military officials said 
indian peacekeeping troops patrolling the city reported no new 
violence but a curfew imposed after thursdays blast remained in 
effect indian and sri lankan officials blamed the bombing on tamil 
militants 
sri lankan military officials in colombo said three people died 
in hospitals today of injuries suffered in the blast thirtyeight 
others died on thursday and at least 54 were injured 
most of trincomalees estimated 12000 sinhalese residents were 
evacuated to the dockyard for their safety the sri lankan 
officials said speaking on condition of anonymity 
tamils account for about 60 percent of the citys 35000 people 
while sinhalese make up 35 percent there also is a small moslem 
minority 
nalin seneviratna head of the provincial council in 
northeastern sri lanka said the car that exploded outside a hotel 
and shopping arcade was packed with an estimated 110 pounds of 
explosives hidden under a pile of coconuts 
he said all but two of those killed were sinhalese who were 
shopping for gifts and sweets to mark their new years day which 
was celebrated thursday the others were members of the tamil 
minority which observed the new years day today 
shortly after the explosion angry sinhalese attacked tamils at 
least four tamils were stabbed to death and seven were wounded 
said seneviratna 
sri lankan military officials blamed a group of tamil 
extremists the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front for 
the blast indian officials blamed the largest tamil rebel militia 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
a spokesman for the tigers in colombo denied responsibility for 
the explosion 
the bombing was linked to the killing of six tamil villagers on 
tuesday in remote kurinchkerni village in trincomalee district 
about 145 miles northeast of the capital colombo military 
officials said 
indian peacekeeping troops have been in northern and eastern sri 
lanka since july 1987 to disarm tamil rebels and enforce a peace 
accord aimed at ending the tamil insurgency that began in 1983 
at least 12500 people mostly sinhalese have been killed in 
the tamil insurrection and the backlash from sinhalese extremists 
opposed to the peace accord 
sinhalese militants claimed the accord gave too many concessions 
to the tamil minority and began a bloody campaign to dislodge the 
government for signing the agreement with india 
india became involved in the ethnic troubles of its southern 
neighbor because of 60 million politically powerful tamils in south 
india 
tamils mostly hindus comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people militants have waged a war against the government 
for an independent state in the north and east of the island 
nation where they are a majority 
they claim they are discriminated against by the mostly buddhist 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population 
president ranasinghe premadasa had ordered a oneweek truce and 
offered amnesty to sinhalese and tamil rebels willing to surrender 
arms the explosion occurred on the second day of the ceasefire 
that began to coincide with the local new year

a man who fails to support his childs 
mother emotionally and financially prior to birth loses his 
standing in an adoption case the florida supreme court has ruled 
because prenatal care of the pregnant mother and unborn child 
is critical to the wellbeing of the child and of society the 
biological father wed or unwed has a responsibility to provide 
support during the prebirth period justice leander shaw wrote 
for the majority in a 61 opinion thursday 
failure to provide that support can constitute abandonment 
normally a fathers consent is required for adoption but a father 
who abandons his unborn child loses that right the high court held 
the ruling is important because it sets the precedent that the 
fathers level of prebirth support can be considered by a judge 
to determine his standing in an adoption case 
the ruling came in the case of an infant identified only as john 
doe to protect his identity a judge in orange county rejected the 
request of the biological parents dubbed richard and mary roe to 
regain custody from the adoptive parents bob and jane doe 
the roes were unwed when the baby was born sept 12 1986 
the 5th district court of appeal in daytona beach reversed the 
decision but allowed the baby to stay with the adoptive parents 
pending the supreme court ruling 
in a sharply worded dissent justice parker lee mcdonald wrote 
that the majority has deprived the biological parents now married 
of their child without a finding that the natural parents are 
unfit in the slightest i think it is a sad day 
when mary roe became pregnant the father said he wasnt ready 
to commit to marriage in part because of financial pressure and 
urged her to have an abortion shaw wrote 
she refused lost her job and lived off public welfare and 
charity while roe failed to provide support they continued to see 
each other and he initially voiced no objection to adoption 
although never giving formal consent 
the supreme court also ruled the mother couldnt withdraw her 
consent to the adoption although she attempted to do so only a few 
days after the child was given to the does three days after the 
baby was born 
she contended her consent had been given under the duress of her 
personal circumstances but those circumstances changed when roe 
agreed to marry her 
the high court held a mother can revoke her consent after 
adoption only if another person had exerted coercion duress or 
fraud to procure that consent

today he will give up his seat in the national assembly to head the 
french conservative campaign in elections june 18 for the european 
parliament

becoming speaker of the 518member parliament made up of 
representatives elected from the 12 countries of the european 
economic community 
the national council of the centerright union for french 
democracy udf voted thursday night to join the rightist rally for 
the republic rpr in backing a list of candidates headed by the 
former president 
one of the component parties of the udf the union of the 
center is expected to decide later this month to back a separate 
list led by simone veil a former speaker of the european 
parliament rather than the joint udfrpr list 
the udf council rejected 4913 a proposal from a group calling 
itself the renovators for calling a joint convention to try to 
put together a list of younger candidates who might unite the 
conservative and centrist forces 
the renovators who include some of the most popular younger 
leaders of both the udf and rpr have made a move in recent weeks

very involved in this european affair 
he said he would urge the centrists not to run a competing list 
of candidates

midjune for a fiveyear term using its own election laws in 
france the system of proportional representation is used the 
socialists have chosen former premier laurent fabius speaker of 
the national assembly to head their list

the un world food program is sending 
an emergency shipment of 5500 tons of rice to laos to make up for 
severe food shortages caused by drought an official said today 
the shipment is only enough food for a fraction of the more than 
730000 people affected by last years drought said jane blaxland 
director of operations of the agencys office for thailand and laos 
a study by the world food program and the un food and 
agriculture organization estimated the drought caused a shortage of 
68200 tons of rice she said 
the un agency paid for the rice from emergency money and is 
calling on the international community to finance further 
shipments miss blaxland said 
the drought severely affected about 60 percent of the population 
in savannakhet champassak and khammouane provinces which a world 
food program news release said normally account for 40 percent of 
the countrys rice 
it said laos is expected to face an acute food shortage 
beginning this month as stocks from the 1988 growing season become 
exhausted 
some people have been selling their buffalos since january to 
buy rice said miss blaxland who visited champassak two weeks 
ago we saw trucks full of buffalos leaving those districts to be 
sold 
we think weve seen the effects of malnutrition just about to 
start among the children she said 
laos which has been under communist rule since 1975 is one of 
the worlds poorest nations with a per capita income estimated at 
135 in 1985

a fierce shelling duel between syrian and 
christian gunners kept civilians off the streets today and delayed 
a french humanitarian mission to lebanon 
only a handful of people ventured out of basements and 
underground bomb shelters early in the day to shop for food 
supplies after the clashes subsided into sporadic mortar exchanges 
by police count 215 people have been killed and 727 wounded 
since the current confrontation between gen michel aouns 
christian troops and an alliance of syrian and druse forces started 
march 8 
a police spokesman said 25000 shells and rockets slammed into 
beiruts moslem and christian sectors in the 20hour duel that 
coincided with the 14th anniversary of the outbreak of civil war in 
1975 
the exchange eased hours after an arab league panel meeting in 
kuwait issued its third ceasefire appeal the past month 
the committee repeats its calls for a cease fire and 
continues its intensified efforts to put an end to the suffering of 
the lebanese people said a statement by the sixmember panel 
headed by kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed sabah 
the statement also noted the failure of the warring sides in 
lebanon to abide by their pledges to consolidate the ceasefire 
the committee formed in january earlier wrapped up talks with 
a delegation of rightwing christian lebanese politicians on ending 
the current violence and solving a sixmonth political crisis that 
threatens to cement the nations de facto partition into sectarian 
cantons 
two french navy vessels the hospital ship la rance and a 
tanker the penhors remained outside lebanese territorial waters 
awaiting sailing orders from french humanitarian assistance 
minister bernard kouchner who is in beirut 
the hospital ship was due to drop anchor in lebanese waters 
thursday and take moslem and christian wounded on board but the 
shelling forced postponement of the operation until further 
notice said a source with the moslem cabinet of acting prime 
minister salim hoss 
the tanker was to deliver fuel oil to moslem and 
christiancontrolled ports so that power stations can continue 
providing electricity 
the main power distribution plant in beiruts christian jamhour 
suburb was struck in a rocket barrage thursday blacking out the 
city and surrounding areas 
the frenchdonated supplies of fuel oil will help us generate 
power but it cannot be distributed unless the jamhour distribution 
station is repaired the electricity authority said in a 
statement 
repair work cannot be launched unless a ceasefire is 
reached the statement added

two guerrillas were killed by security 
forces this week after negotiators had worked out a plan for the 
insurgents to withdraw safely to angola a territorial official 
said today 
gerhard roux spokesman for the south africaninstalled 
administrator of namibia confirmed the deaths which were reported 
by a south african newspaper thursday he said details would be 
available later today 
south african foreign minister pik botha said about 350 
guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization had 
withdrawn and about 900 remained in namibia as of today a day 
before a deadline for them to leave 
he said about 1600 guerrillas infiltrated into northern namibia 
beginning april 1 the first day of a ceasefire and a yearlong 
unsupervised process to make the territory independent during 
the next eight days 263 guerrillas and 27 members of the south 
africanled security forces reportedly were killed in fighting 
bothas estimate of swapo infiltrators was lower than previous 
south african estimates of 1900 he said 22 had been captured 
last weekend south african cuban and angolan officials worked 
out an arrangement guaranteeing safe passage for guerrillas to 
angola if they reported to unmonitored checkpoints as of this 
morning however only five guerrillas had reported to the 
checkpoints the others who withdrew apparently did so on their 
own 
a un official cedric thornberry said thursday the insurgents 
probably were reluctant to surface because of the menacing 
presence of security forces near the assembly points 
the ceasefire has not been reinstated since last weeks 
fighting although south africa has said its forces would fire at 
guerrillas only if attacked 
the deadline for the withdrawal is saturday but botha said his 
government is prepared to extend it 
botha also agreed with the united nations that south african 
soldiers would not be allowed to interrogate guerrillas who report 
to the checkpoints territorial officials said wednesday that such 
interrogation would take place and some south african soldiers 
tried to get access to four guerrillas at a checkpoint thursday but 
were rebuffed by australian and british members of the un 
moinitoring force 
un investigators have supported south africas contention that 
the guerrillas incursion violated an accord requiring they stay at 
angolan bases at least until may 15 when they could enter namibia 
as unarmed refugees 
swapos exiled president sam nujoma has called on his fighters 
to withdraw but has not told them to report to the checkpoints an 
undetermined number have gone back into angola on their own and 
police say others are likely to try to remain in namibia in 
civilian guise 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i in december 
it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for 
cuba withdrawing its estimated 50000 troops from angola 
swapo has been fighting against south african rule since 1966 
and is favored to get the most votes in preindependence elections 
scheduled for november there is uncertainty whether it will get 
the twothirds support needed to have full control over formation 
of a new government

coronary bypass surgery may not be the best 
solution for everybody but it still offers greater benefits to 
nearly all heartdisease patients than drugs and diet alone 
according to a study published today 
if youre an 80yearold who isnt terribly active but want 
to see your grandkids grow up medical treatment may be 
sufficient said dr robert califf of the duke university medical 
center and principal author of the study 
but if youre an 80yearold who enjoys playing golf and other 
exercise then surgery may very well be worth it he said 
thursday in a telephone interview from his office in durham nc 
blockages of the coronary arteries lead to heart attacks which 
claim about 500000 victims each year and are the leading cause of 
death in the united states 
debate has raged within the medical community in recent years 
over the most efficient and costeffective manner of treatment 
this message is that while bypass leads to a better outcome 
were not prescribing surgery for every patient with blocked 
arteries califf said 
califf said the new research published in todays editions of 
the journal of the american medical association better defines the 
relative benefits and risks giving doctors and patients more 
information on which to base a decision 
currently about half of all new cases of heart disease are 
treated with drugs and diet and lifestyle management which usually 
involves weight loss exercise and lowering such risk factors as 
cholesterol intake and stress 
treatment of the remaining cases is split about evenly between 
coronary bypass a procedure in which doctors surgically attach new 
blood vessels to improve blood flow and angioplasty which 
involves surgical insertion of a balloon to widen narrowed arteries 
the scientists limited the study group to 5809 coronary disease 
patients who received either medical treatment 2847 or bypass 
surgery 2962 between 1969 and 1984 
the study found that the greater benefits afforded by coronary 
bypass surgery applied across the spectrum of patients regardless 
of age or degree of heart dysfunction and that both the oneyear 
and fiveyear survival rates after surgical treatment climbed 
dramatically between 1970 and 1980 
but califf said researchers determined that all methods of 
treating coronary disease had improved so much in the 15year 
period that bypass surgery ultimately may be the best course of 
treatment only for those patients with the most severe coronary 
blockages 
coronary bypass procedures cost about 30000 compared to an 
absolute maximum of several thousand dollars for drug diet and 
lifestyle therapy 
the study did not measure the costeffectiveness of the two 
treatments although califf is involved in several of a number of 
ongoing studies that will do so 
the study also did not examine angioplasty average cost 
12000 as an alternative and in an editorial in the same issue 
dr j willis hurst suggested the time had come for a comparative 
study including angioplasty 
just as general agreement is reached regarding the value of 
bypass surgery compared with medical management we now must 
consider the indications for coronary angioplasty said hurst of 
the emory university school of medicine in atlanta

there should be room on broadway for a brash 
boisterous musical that doesnt aspire to more than a few laughs 
and a good time 
but welcome to the club the new cy colemanae hotchner 
musical sets its sights low and delivers just that if it werent 
for colemans thoroughly professional score welcome to the 
club would be the most horizontal musical in town 
the setting is a new york city alimony jail and the subject is 
divorce four men and one woman a countrywestern star not unlike 
dolly parton languish in this prison for nonpayment of alimony 
hotchner best known for his autobiography of ernest hemingway 
has devised the most minimal of stories a collection of stock 
situations that emphasize crude and rude stereotypes not people 
theres the jewish drugstore owner played by the evermugging 
avery schreiber his gorgon of a wife marilyn sokol wants his 
money so she can find happiness in miami beach he plans to escape 
to brazil where american law cant reach him 
another member of the club is an insurance man whose wife 
suffers from bmania caused by excessive shopping at such 
places as bergdorfs bendels bonwit teller and b altmans 
then theres the cynical writer getting back at his wife by 
putting her in his latest magazine article and of course the plot 
needs the naive young couple whose marriage is falling apart 
because of a meddling motherinlaw 
the best thing about welcome to the club is colemans score 
the man who wrote sweet charity little me and barnum 
is an expert craftsman capable of the breeziest of melodies if 
anything makes this musical move its the music 
his score is a series of pastiches that includes a 
countrywestern lament a rossinilike number for the entire cast 
a sexy double entendre song and one of those big belting ballads 
here called the name of love that can rouse any audience to 
applause of the other numbers a sweet love song called at my 
side also lingers after the show it is done with charming 
innocence by scott waara and jodi benson the young lovers 
the show has been cast with strong performers the classiest is 
marcia mitzman playing the writers exwife she manages to 
project a sympathy that isnt apparent in the book terri white 
growls her way through the bluestinged piece of cake and then 
doesnt have anything to do for the rest of the show 
sally mayes wails effectively as the country singer done wrong 
and she has an amusing musical battle with scott wentworth as they 
sing about the merits and demerits of the north and south 
hotchners book collapses in act 2 forcing coleman to devise 
numbers that kill time rather than advance the plot the ending 
also is unsatisfactory for a musical about divorce its strange 
that almost everybody ends up back together at the final curtain 
despite colemans flavorsome score welcome to the club is a 
bargainbasement revue masquerading as a musical 
in other new york reviews frank rich wrote in the new york 
times that the play offers less in the way of gritty domestic 
reality than most television commercials for leading headache 
remedies reflecting the absence of credible characters or drama or 
emotions mr hotchners book dispenses with scenes and story for 
idle song cues 
this show was a miscalculation from the very second it was 
conceived wrote howard kissel in the daily news a full 
evening of spitefulness and recriminations is unimaginably gross 
clive barnes wrote in the new york post there are just so 
many jokes or jokevariants available about wives motherinlaws 
divorce and assorted marital unhappenings that hotchner can make 
and he probably makes most of them but this remains a onejoke 
revue in search of a story

the parents of two czech teenagers 
who hijacked a hungarian plane last month have asked west german 
authorities to extradite their children the communist party daily 
rude pravo reported today 
stefan macicko and dusan styk aged 16 and 17 years 
respectively shot their way onto a malev airlines jetliner march 
29 and commandeered the plane to frankfurt after the plane crew 
told them the plane was incapable of flying all the way to the 
united states 
czechoslovakia and west germany have no extradition treaty and 
on past occasions of airline terrorism hijackers were always 
prosecuted under west german law 
the parents are aware of the seriousness of criminal acts 
committed by their children as well as the ensuing consequences 
the newspaper quoted foreign ministry spokesman ivan kulhanek as 
saying 
although this is a very serious criminal act the emotions of 
parents cannot be overlooked the daily added 
the request should be judged from the point of view of good 
neighhborly relations between czechoslovakia and west germany our 
side has also confirmed the principle of reciprocity in case a west 
german plane would be hijacked to czechoslovakia kulhanek said 
letters in which the parents ask for extradition of their 
children to czechoslovak authorities were handed over to the west 
german embassy on thursday the paper reported

a resolution from a black legislator 
that tiptoed through the alabama house kicked up a roar when 
lawmakers realized they had agreed to remove the confederate battle 
flag from the capitol dome 
the unsuspecting lawmakers on an uncontested voice vote 
approved a resolution by democratic rep demetrious newton to 
remove the confederate banner 
but the lawmakers quickly reversed themselves when they found 
out what they had done 
the flag has been a source of controversy for black leaders who 
have described it as a symbol of bigotry and oppression 
the resolution proposed by newton said the confederate flag atop 
the dome was in deplorable condition and called for it to be 
taken down for complete repair and not returned to its position 
until inspected and approved by the sponsor of this resolution 
several minutes after the house approved newtons resolution a 
white lawmaker republican rep arthur payne discovered its 
contents and asked that the vote be reconsidered 
the house voted 6015 to reconsider the resolution and send it 
to the rules committee a traditional graveyard for such flag 
resolutions 
newton said that he had never seen a voice vote reconsidered 
before 
i think it was not fairly done but that is the way the old 
cookie crumbles newton said 
newton added he would have returned the flag to the capitol dome 
at such time as it looked good and was attractive to all 
alabamians 
last year former state rep thomas reed and 13 other black 
legislators attempted to remove the flag but were blocked by law 
enforcement officers and arrested they were convicted of 
trespassing and fined 
later reed state president of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the naacp sued to remove the 
banner us district judge robert varner ruled last month the 
banner did not violate the constitutional rights of blacks 
gov guy hunt the states first republican governor this 
century has said repeatedly he thinks the confederate flag is a 
historic symbol and he will not remove it unless instructed to do 
so by the legislature

congressional approval of a compromise 497 
million package of nonmilitary aid for the nicaraguan rebels gives 
president bush bipartisan support to pressure the sandinista 
government into keeping its promises on instituting democratic 
reforms lawmakers say 
i think weve made a step in the right direction senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan said thursday moments after the 
senate voted 899 to approve the plan now we can be an active 
player in that part of the world 
secretary of state james a baker iii who hammered out the plan 
with senate and house leaders has said the history of disagreement 
between the democraticcontrolled congress and the republican white 
house over central america has hamstrung us policy toward the 
region 
the accord provides an opportunity to put behind us one of the 
most divisive foreign policy issues in postwar history and embark 
on a new more hopeful diplomacy toward central america baker 
said earlier in the week 
the overwhelming senate vote came thursday night just a few 
hours after the house passed the plan by a similarly decisive 
margin 309110 house speaker jim wright of texas said the 
legislation sets in motion a united singlevoice policy 
in nicaragua on thursday the ruling sandinista party condemned 
the contra aid package saying it threatens the nicaraguan 
government and makes fun of the will of the central american 
presidents nicaraguan president daniel ortega also promised to 
push for democratic reforms in his country and moved up elections 
by 10 months to february 1990 
despite the strong support on both sides of the aisle in 
congress the plan had its critics 
sen jesse helms rnc one of the strongest supporters of the 
contras attacked the plan as little more than seven months of 
beans and bandaids he objected unsuccessfully to an unusual 
feature effectively giving congress veto power over further aid 
after nov 30 
helms and others conservative senators were upset because baker 
agreed not to spend any money on the contras after that date if 
just one congressional committee withheld consent 
helms charged that the agreement amounted to an unconstitutional 
legislative veto and produced a letter he received from former 
us court of appeals judge robert bork supporting his argument 
some have defended this arrangement by asserting that while 
it would clearly be illegal if written into a statute it is all 
right as a gentlemans agreement bork said that observation 
in no way alters the fact that constitutional processes are being 
circumvented 
bork a supreme court nominee of former president reagan was 
rejected by the senate in august 1988 
the compromise plan represents a truce in the rancorous 
8yearold fight between the white house and congress over aid to 
the rebels 
the plan would give the contras food clothing and medical 
assistance to sustain them through next february but it would bar 
aid for weapons and ammunition to renew the guerrillas fight 
against the government 
supporters of the compromise said it would put nicaraguas 
sandinista leadership under intense international pressure to keep 
its promises permit free national elections next february and 
observe other deadlines for democracy set by agreements among 
central american presidents over the last two years 
although the aid package includes money for the contras through 
february congress will be given an opportunity in november to 
review the situation and halt the aid if it sees fit 
in debate on the house floor republican leader bob michel of 
illinois a supporter of the agreement told his colleagues that 
what it lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective help 
for the cause of progress and democracy in nicaragua and central 
america 
i wish we could do better but as legislators its not given to 
us to act only when conditions are perfect michel said 
rep henry hyde rill a longstanding contra supporter said 
he would go along with the compromise 
i support this bill on the theory that if you cant get 
dinner take a sandwich and keep hope alive hyde said 
its a crow sandwich replied rep barney frank dmass a 
consistent contra aid opponent 
my problem is that price of crow has gone up were paying too 
much here to allow the architects of a disastrous contra policy to 
save face

the prosecution rested its case against 
defendant richard ramirez after a witness said ramirez displayed 
gruesome photographs of a murder victim and boasted theres 
blood behind the night stalker 
the close of the prosecutions case was far ahead of schedule 
we had less actual testimony than we had at the preliminary 
hearing deputy district attorney p phillip halpin said outside 
court thursday he said he had dropped some witnesses in order to 
present all of the evidence in 31 days of testimony over two months 
ramirez 29 a drifter from el paso texas is charged with 13 
gruesome murders and 30 related felonies in a string of nighttime 
attacks that terrified southern californians in the summer of 1985 
superior judge michael tynan scheduled the trial to resume may 1 
with defense testimony 
the final prosecution witness was david laws a sheriffs deputy 
who guarded the defendant in his highsecurity area of the county 
jail for a year and a half 
laws said that on oct 30 1986 ramirez summoned him and showed 
him two grisly pictures of a murder victim 
he said people come up here and call me a punk and i show 
them the pictures and say theres blood behind the night 
stalker and they go away all pale laws testified 
he identified one of the pictures he said ramirez had displayed 
it showed victim maxine zazzara who was stabbed and had her eyes 
gouged out 
gerald newbold a sheriffs deputy who guarded ramirez shortly 
after his aug 30 1985 arrest testified he saw ramirez drawing 
666 and a pentagram symbols of devil worship in his own blood 
on his cell floor 
after six months of jury selection testimony in the nearly 
4yearold case began jan 30 by the time the prosecution case 
wound up thursday halpin had called 137 witnesses and presented 
521 pieces of evidence including many gruesome photographs of the 
night stalker victims 
at one point the trial was recessed for three weeks when 
defense attorney daniel hernandez said he was too exhausted by 
stress to continue another attorney ray clark was then appointed 
to assist him and the trial went on 
clark has said the defense case will take two to four weeks if 
the estimate is correct the trial could wrap up in far less than 
the two years jurors had been told to expect

a 28yearold insurance 
executive who served with the army in namibia was sentenced today 
to 18 months in prison for refusing to complete his military 
service 
saul batzofin is the fourth conscientious objector sent to 
prison in the past 13 months military service is mandatory for all 
ablebodied white men in south africa 
batzofin completed his initial twoyear service in the army 
seven years ago but last year he refused to report for a required 
callup camp 
he said a major factor in his decision was his army service in 
the ovambo region of northern namibia where south african troops 
were fighting black nationalist guerrillas 
the army does not act in the interests of the people of 
namibia batzofin said in a statement prior to his trial 
residents of ovamboland were treated with disrespect and 
contempt 
he also said corpses of slain guerrillas were kicked and put on 
public display at army bases then buried in shallow graves so that 
wild animals could dig up the bodies 
my response as a young conscript to incidents of this type was 
an absolute horror and abhorrence of war in general batzofin 
said 
fighting between guerrillas and security forces in namibia 
flared up again april 1 at the start of unsupervised transition 
period that is to end with territory becoming independent of south 
africa 
batzofin pleaded guilty and his attorneys asked the presiding 
magistrate to sentence him to community service rather than prison 
but magistrate ph bredenkamp said today he had no option 
because the law mandates a prison sentence for all draft resisters 
equal to 1 times the amount of service they still faced 
batzofins company liberty life has pledged to let him return 
to his job as a career development officer when he gets out of jail 
last year david bruce 25 and charles bester 18 were 
sentenced to six years in prison for refusing to enter the 
military dr ivan toms who ran a clinic in a black squatter camp 
was sentenced to 21 months for refusing to report to a callup camp 
batzofin was a member of the end conscription campaign a 
nationwide group opposed to mandatory military service that was 
banned by the government last year the organization was critical 
of the armys role in namibia and also in black townships where 
troops have been used to control antiapartheid unrest 
in august batzofin and 142 other young men publicly stated that 
they would refuse military service 
batzofins supporters in the courtroom showered him with yellow 
flowers as he was led away by wardens after the sentencing the 
supporters lingered in the chamber and sang god bless africa 
an antiapartheid anthem after the magistrate left

a prosecutor has appealed a court decision 
clearing financier carlo de benedetti of wrongdoing in connection 
with italys biggest banking scandal in decades news reports said 
today 
banco ambrosiano italys largest private bank collapsed in 
1982 after it was unable to collect 13 billion in loans made to 
10 dummy companies in latin america the loans were issued after 
letters of assurance were received from the vatican bank 
de benedetti was notified in 1987 he was under investigation for 
possible extortion in connection with his sale of banco ambrosiano 
shares shortly before it went bankrupt last week two milan 
magistrates indicted 35 people in connection with their 
investigation of the scandal they cleared de benedetti of any 
wrongdoing in connection with the bank failure 
de benedettis economic empire includes the olivetti computer 
group and mondadori one of italys giant publishing houses 
italian news agencies and state television said prosecutor pier 
luigi dellosso disagreed with the magistrates conclusion about de 
benedetti and had asked the court of appeals to indict the 
financier for alleged extortion of roberto calvi the banco 
ambrosiano chairman whose body was found hanging from a london 
bridge in 1982 a court ruled in january that calvi was murdered 
de benedetti was vice chairman of the bank for 65 days when 
calvi was chairman 
last week de benedetti said he was satisfied because he had 
always acted in the full respect of the law 
those indicted last week included licio gelli a financier who 
was charged with complicity in fraudulent bankruptcy gelli has 
been accused in other investigations of masterminding a ring of 
rightwing terrorists 
he was grandmaster of a secret lodge that investigators linked 
to a plot to topple the government

federal drug and perjury charges against a 
friend of mayor marion barry jr are prompting critics to raise new 
questions about the mayors ability to lead the citys antidrug 
war 
charles lewis 48 a former city employee was charged in a 
10count indictment thursday with lying to a grand jury seven times 
about whether he used bought shared or offered to sell cocaine 
he also faces three counts of cocaine possession 
it is the second time in five years that an associate of the 
mayors has faced drug charges 
it heightens the circumstantial perception that theres more 
there than weve been told said rep stan parris rva an 
outspoken critic of the barry administration when do you reach 
the point where you can conclude that where theres smoke theres 
fire 
one of the perjury charges alleges that lewis lied about whether 
he possessed cocaine on dec 22 a day that barry has acknowledged 
visiting lewis hotel room at a ramada inn in the city 
what was the mayor doing with mr lewis asked council 
chairman david clarke 
lewis also is charged with lying about whether he bought or used 
drugs with two companions on dec 21 a day on which barry 
reportedly visited his room twice 
the us attorney for the district of columbia jay b stephens 
stressed that the indictment does not accuse the mayor or anyone 
but lewis of wrongdoing 
but one top city official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said i wouldnt rest easily if i were the mayor 
stephens made clear he isnt done which could mean a lot more can 
happen 
lewis indictment marks the second time barrys reputation has 
been clouded by charges that his friends use drugs in 1984 
convicted cocaine dealer karen johnson spent 11 months in jail on 
contempt charges after she refused to tell a grand jury whether she 
used drugs with barry and other top city officials 
barry who is married acknowledged having a personal 
relationship with johnson but denied using drugs with her 
the lewis indictment which comes as barry is struggling to slow 
a drugfueled record murder rate threatens to further undermine 
the mayors leadership and credibility on drug issues 
the mayors attorney kenneth mundy said of the indictment 
it does not refer to any allegedly perjurious statements by mr 
lewis to the grand jury which involve the mayor mundy said that 
left the message that the mayors conduct whatever else it might 
have been was nothing criminal 
mundy also confirmed that he had met with barry on thursday but 
declined to discuss their conversation 
barry has repeatedly asserted that lewis never used drugs in his 
presence 
the us attorneys office began its probe dec 22 when city 
police officers were called off an attempt to make an undercover 
drug purchase from lewis after barry showed up at his hotel room 
stephens said the investigation has cleared police of any 
misconduct but continues to focus on the ramada inn episode and 
other related events including a 260000 joint personnel project 
involving the city and virgin islands governments lewis was fired 
from the project a year ago amid concerns about cost overruns 
although lewis checked out of his hotel room dec 23 before 
police could search it or officially link traces of cocaine found 
in the room to him stephens said investigators may have gathered 
physical evidence that will stand up in court 
barry who found out about the indictment while testifying on 
the citys drug problem before a house panel refused to comment 
if convicted lewis faces a fiveyear maximum penalty on each 
perjury charge plus up to one year for each cocaine possession 
charge lewis is already under indictment in the virgin islands 
he is awaiting trial there on april 17 on two counts of 
possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute 
after he allegedly tried to sell crack cocaine to an undercover fbi 
agent

a gene that is thought to be responsible for 
the development of colon cancer has been identified by researchers 
in a study published today in the journal science researchers 
from maryland texas and utah reported that a gene called p53 tends 
to be found in a mutated form in colon cancer tumors 
the discovery eventually could lead to specific tests to detect 
the disease before other symptoms occur and while the cancer is 
still curable the study said 
the researchers said they also found that almost all colon 
cancers lose additional genetic material as the tumors progress 
several genetic changes are probably required for the 
development of these cancers said bert vogelstein an associate 
professor at johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore 
the report said that 53 of 56 colon tumors excised by surgery 
and analyzed showed the loss of genetic material and that patients 
with the most genetic changes were those most likely to experience 
a return of their colon cancer 
the study said the p53 gene is a suppressor gene that can 
inhibit tumor growth normal cells have two such genes colon 
cancer cells however have no normal copies of the gene one copy 
is lost and the other is mutated 
studies suggest that mutation of suppressor genes remove part of 
the bodys resistance to tumor growth 
colon cancer is diagnosed in 147000 people a year in the united 
states and about 61000 die of the disease it ranks second in 
frequency and death among the types of cancers 
the research for the report was performed at johns hopkins the 
university of utah and at md anderson hospital and the baylor 
college of medicine in houston

contractor has been accused of defrauding the army by providing 
inferior parts for m16 rifles and other weapons 
douglas w mordal formerly a supervisor at jc manufacturing 
inc in surburban spring lake park is charged in a federal 
complaint filed thursday in us district court in st paul 
mordal is accused of using inferior and softer metals and 
testing procedures to fill seven orders of parts for m16s m60 
machine guns and m203 grenade launchers 
some gun experts say that rifle and gun bolts manufactured with 
softer steel are subject to backfiring or jamming theyre also 
subject to faster wear 
the contracts filled between january 1983 and march 1987 were 
worth a total of more than 22 million 
the complaint says mordal is scheduled to plead guilty wednesday 
before federal judge robert renner 
mordals attorney joseph friedberg declined to comment mordal 
did not immediately return a telephone message left today at his 
home in surburban elk river 
joseph walbran an assistant us attorney handling the case 
said the charges against mordal are an event in a continuing 
investigation he declined to say whether other company officials 
will be charged 
the company is alleged to have sold the weapons parts 
fraudulently by using a softer alloy steel than call for in their 
contracts with the us armament munitions and chemical command 
experts on guns asked to explain the possible effect of using 
softer metals said it could cause problems the star tribune 
reported today 
wade hanson a salesman for burger brothers sporting goods in 
bloomington said weapons made parts of with softer metals may be 
subject to a dangerous blowback effect that could send the 
shell backward

the nations radio talkmasters who discovered 
their clout in the drive to kill the congressional pay raise will 
meet in june to do what they do best talk and organize their 
budding political power 
what were going to do is see what things we all have in 
common and try to get people to participate at the appropriate 
moment said bostons jerry williams of wrko an old hand at 
generating a public furor via the airwaves and the host of the 
conference here 
a good many people who listen to talk radio feel frustrated 
that they never knew what to do in responding to issues williams 
said in a recent interview we just lead them down the path 
telling them here are the principles 
beginning june 9 williams will have most of the visiting talk 
show hosts on his afternoon program among those expected to attend 
are michael siegel of king in seattle roy fox of kfyi in phoenix 
tom leykis of kfi in los angeles al rantel of wnws in miami and 
former philadelphia mayor frank rizzo now a talk show host on wcau 
in philadelphia 
radio hosts have long used the airwaves to stir up interest in 
local issues but last february they took the technique nationwide 
led by talk show hosts listeners flooded congress with a 
torrent of tea bags bearing the message read my tea bag no 50 
percent raise the public pressure helped quash a salary hike for 
congressmen judges and others on the federal payroll 
now siegel in seattle is trying to generate national interest 
in a campaign to boycott exxon to protest its response to the exxon 
valdez oil spill he has been interviewed on other radio stations 
around the country and says he is receiving 200 letters a day many 
containing demolished exxon credit cards 
the entertainment media have gone far in the past year with the 
radio talk show host the 1988 film talk radio depicted a 
badgering texas talk show host and the televsion series midnight 
caller features on an excop who uses the airwaves to fight crime 
the talk show hosts have loosely formed a federation but as 
yet it has no name williams is considering vox pop short for 
the latin phrase vox populi or voice of the people 
williams and other radio hosts say they are lobbyists for their 
listeners 
but others see them as demagogues who gloss over the 
complexities of issues and sell a largely conservative brand of 
conventional wisdom to their audiences 
rep vic fazio dcalif a supporter of the payraise bill 
spoke out against the radiodriven pressure against the measure 
we became cartoon cannon fodder for trash televison and for talk 
radio fazio said from the house floor we fell prey to the 
deception of the rabble rousers 
im a little bit concerned that the local disc jockeys and 
talk show hosts are using serious national issues for 
audiencebuilding said james h quello a member of the federal 
communications commission some of them remind me of college 
sophomores at a rally 
for sophomores the radio hosts make good money a host in a 
major market can easily make more than 100000 a year and 
sometimes much more according to phoenix radio host barry young 
and they can be worth that to their stations in a random 
sampling talk shows on three am stations rated by the arbitron co 
all increased their market share by last fall compared to the 
previous year in less than a year in 1988 the jerry williams show 
went from a 79 percent share to a 93 percent share 
murry levin a political science professor at boston university 
and author of talk radio and the american dream listened to 
700 hours of local talk radio programing and is convinced of its 
power 
talk radio he said is the only medium that provides an 
outlet for workingclass people 
siegel despite his success in getting support on the oil spill 
issue says the audience not the host sets the agenda we dont 
have control over these people

shotguns and rifles 
opponents said the bill approved thursday would not deter the 
use of powerful weapons in crimes and could interfere with citizens 
and hunters 
and it could face opposition in the senate where the chairman 
of the judiciary committee suggested an alternative that would 
require owners of assault rifles to register with police 
several representatives said the legislation was a reaction to 
the shooting deaths of five stockton calif schoolchildren in 
january 
its not a stocktonrelated issue said democratic rep 
nicholas tsiongas we have a very aggresive and violent society 
and thats why we had problems with guns 
i dont think its going to deter crime said rep michael 
zanni also a democrat a number of these weapons that are 
mentioned are very expensive hunting rifles 
the house legislation passed 6330 after nearly two hours of 
debate 
house members approved on a 7018 vote a measure extending the 
waiting period on handguns from 72 hours to one week and 
implementing a oneweek waiting period on shotguns and rifles 
a gun control bill is pending in the senate but no vote has 
been planned 
meanwhile in michigan a bill was introduced in the legislature 
on thursday to regulate the sale of semiautomatic weapons 
including assault rifles 
the bills sponsor sen nick smith a republican said it would 
keep the weapons away from criminals while protecting the rights of 
private citizens 
the measure drew support from the state sheriffs association 
but was opposed by a representative of the national rifle 
association

a government advisory body has called 
for a review of the show trial of former premier imre nagy who was 
executed in 1958 the state news agency mti reported 
meanwhile the government daily magyar hirlap reported today 
that premier miklos nemeth plans to reshuffle the government next 
month 
nagy a critic of the soviet union was ousted and arrested in 
1956 after soviet soldiers and tanks crushed a revolt that demanded 
red army forces leave hungary he was executed on charges of 
conspiracy and creating a secret organization aimed at forcibly 
seizing power and overthrowing the hungarian peoples democracy 
the decision to reassess nagys and other stalinist show trials 
of the 1950s is widely seen as the first step toward nagys 
rehabilitation which is being demanded by several independent 
political groups in hungary 
political rehabilitation would involve communist party officials 
saying it was a mistake to try him and that he was an honest man 
but communist party chief karoly grosz recently ruled out nagys 
political rehabilitation saying that during the 1956 revolution he 
made too many mistakes 
a purely legal rehabilitation would be a different matter grosz 
added under that form of rehabilitation judicial authorities 
would say that a person convicted on a given charge should not have 
been convicted 
the bodies of nagy and four of his associates have been exhumed 
from their unmarked graves in recent weeks the government has 
given permission for a funeral to bury nagys remains june 16 the 
31st anniversary of his execution 
acting on information from justice minister kalman kulcsar the 
advisory body said judicial authorities should look into the nagy 
trial in line with an earlier government resolution to review the 
show trials 
they want the review to be thorough but done as fast as 
possible so that a satisfactory general solution can be found after 
the examination of other trials conducted in the same period mti 
reported thursday 
it said the body would welcome a decision to review the penal 
code regarding antistate offenses and would propose abolition of 
capital punishment in such cases 
the abolition of capital punishment for antistate crimes would 
pave the way for the summary rehabilitation of the revolutionary 
leaders 
nemeths plans to reshuffle the government follow wednesdays 
toplevel changes in the communist partys ruling politburo 
a necessary harmony in outlook and unity of action was 
missing in government in recent months nemeth was quoted as 
saying in magyar hirlap this situation cannot continue any 
longer 
nemeth did not mention any names with the exception of minister 
of health and social care judit csehak who had asked not to be 
renominated for politburo membership wednesday

a pair of toy pistols grounded three international 
flights and hundreds of passengers when officials at logan 
international airport decided to err on the side of caution 
officials halted flights for several hours after a security 
agent checking hand luggage and passengers thursday night spotted 
two guns among the bags moving through her xray machine 
when the agent looked up she thought she saw someone take the 
handbag and run into the crowded concourse phil orlandella 
spokesman for the airport said 
we went into an emergency procedure and sealed off the area 
orlandella said better safe than sorry 
a british airways 747 carrying 356 passengers was backing away 
from the gate at about 915 pm when the pilot was signaled to 
return 
we decided we would take the conservative approach said 
denis campbell an assistant manager for the airline 
campbell said passengers were asked to deplane and undergo a 
security check a second time the check turned up two toy guns in a 
cellophanecovered package that a 12yearold girl had carried onto 
the plane in her bag 
orlandella said the security agent who spotted the suspicious 
items was asked to try to identify the woman she thought had made 
off with the bag 
the agent at one point identified a passenger on the british 
airways flight but a second security check of the woman and her 
traveling companions revealed nothing he said 
but we decided she could have passed the guns on to somebody 
else so we ran the whole group through again orlandella said 
we also checked the whole aircraft from front to back and side to 
side 
orlandella said air france and swissair also had a jumbo jet 
each held back but that all three flights had departed by 1130 pm

a huge convoy carrying muchneeded 
food and fuel to kabul broke through a guerrilla blockade along a 
major supply route today 
the convoy of up to 100 trucks and tanks pushed down the salang 
highway running south from the soviet border to the capital the 
strategic road 260 miles long has been closed for a week by 
moslem insurgents 
the guerrillas are hoping to starve the capital until it 
surrenders 
as the convoy moved down the highway soldiers fired from tanks 
and machine gun posts into the surrounding mountains where the 
insurgents are hiding 
the firing continued for nearly two hours with thick black 
smoke billowing from the hills about six to 10 miles away 
helicopter gunships provided protection for the convoy several 
trucks appeared to have been damaged and one truck was carrying 
several wounded men 
a second military convoy moved out of the capital overnight and 
down another vital road used to carry supples to the city of 225 
million people diplomats said government soldiers have been 
trying to clear the road to the besieged city of jalalabad the 
road has been closed to routine traffic for nearly two weeks the 
guerrillas said they control about 20 miles of the highway the 
major route to the border with pakistan 
one diplomat said the guerrillas had seized a convoy of empty 
trucks returning to jalalabad parked them along the road and then 
placed mines inside 
the soviet union has been airlifting food and military equipment 
to kabul to help the government of president najib hold out against 
the rebels 
supplies also are being airlifted into the strategically 
important cities of jalalabad and khost said one senior soviet 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the diplomats said the salang highway had been cut by rebel 
commander ahmad shah masood and his jamiatiislami group which 
has struck deals in the past with the prosoviet government to 
allow some convoys through 
the guerrillas have made blockades a primary tactic in their 
fight to overthrow the marxist government that seized power in an 
april 1978 coup 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said thursday 
that also said fighting had eased around jalalabad a provincial 
capital 70 miles east of kabul 
he added however that fierce fighting continued near the 
southern towns of khost and ghazni 
amani said six government soldiers died while beating back 
guerrillas on three fronts around khost at least 185 guerrillas 
were killed he said 
the moslem insurgents based in pakistan and supported by the 
united states saudi arabia and china launched their offensive 
around jalalabad on march 6 but have not succeeded in dislodging 
government troops 
the soviet source said about 2000 government troops had died 
since the guerrillas began bombarding the city with tens of 
thousands of rockets he said 8000 rebels had been killed in 
retaliatory strikes 
he did not know how many civilians have died in the siege 
the afghan armed forces are equipped with sophisticated weapons 
from the soviet union 
they can have the hardware at our disposal in any numbers they 
want the official said jalalabad must be held it will be 
held 
soviet officials have denied moscow sent arms since the troop 
pullout but that soviet weapons left are not affected by the geneva 
accord which prohibits any outside interference 
still the soviets have continued to supply president najibs 
army with weapons including longrange scudb missiles now used by 
government troops against the guerrillas besieging jalalabad 
in new delhi afghanistans ambassador today accused washington 
of violating the accord by arming the guerrillas 
the geneva accord is fully implemented by afghanistan and the 
soviet union but unfortunately the other parties concerned have 
not implemented it and the situation has gotten more tense than 
ever before abdul samad azhar told reporters 
if jalalabad falls it would be the largest city captured by the 
rebels in the decadelong civil war and would give them a base to 
set up their interim government formed in february in pakistan 
the soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from 
afghanistan on feb 15 ending more than nine years of direct 
involvement in the civil war

most members of the house ways and means 
committee are sponsoring a bill by chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill to simplify rules that prohibit employerfinanced health 
insurance plans from discriminating against lowerpaid workers 
the rules aimed at encouraging extension of medical insurance 
to a greater number of employees were enacted as part of the 1986 
tax overhaul they have been assailed widely on grounds they impose 
a heavy burden of paperwork on employers some businesses say the 
rules are so onerous that they have threatened to drop all employee 
health insurance 
it is my hope that recordkeeping and data collection 
requirements of employers particularly small employers will be 
significantly reduced rostenkowski said in introducing his 
modification bill thursday 
although he remains firmly committed to seeing that higherpaid 
employees do not get a disproportionate share of benefits 
rostenkowski said those requirements should not be so 
administratively burdensome on small or late employers that they 
discourage the establishment and maintenance of fringebenefit 
programs for broad classes of employees 
the disputed rules generally require employers to conduct 
detailed complicated tests to determine whether their 
fringebenefit plans principally health insurance discriminate 
against those making less than 50000 a year 
the rules went into effect on jan 1 but the internal revenue 
service waived them until july 1 and agreed that no employer would 
be penalized if a goodfaith effort to follow the rules were made 
the remainder of 1989 
rostenkowskis bill stops short of repealing the rules which 
are known by their location in the tax code section 89 many 
members of congress have endorsed repeal 
under rostenkowskis bill employers that provide a health plan 
would have to offer coverage costing workers 10 a week or less 
25 or less for a family plan to 90 percent of employees 
higherpaid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that 
was better than provided other employees 
the bill is being sponsored by 28 members of ways and means 
including all democrats on the panel

more than 200 paintings and sculptures many 
never before exhibited and only recently rescued from decades of 
neglect have gone on display in a show that encompasses 164 years 
of american art 
the show which opened today in manhattan before beginning a 
sevencity national tour is composed almost entirely of works 
donated by the artists to the national academy of design as a 
requirement for membership 
its interesting because our artists choose differently than 
curators would choose said john dobkin director of the academy 
these are works i would hope that the artists feel very strongly 
about 
the academy was formed in 1825 by a group of artists as a 
school rather than a museum to elevate the character and 
condition of the arts of design in our country 
from the beginning artists were required to submit a 
selfportrait or other likeness upon their election as an associate 
member and an example of their work upon induction as an 
academician 
the artists have been remarkably generous dobkin said in an 
interview thursday before a preview showing in a fifth avenue 
mansion donated to the academy in 1940 
but as the collection grew over the years the academy was 
unable to keep up with it 
dobkin said that when he became director in 1978 the storage 
facility was so inadequate and the conditions for the paintings 
were so lamentable that scholars hadnt been able to look at the 
collection for years 
funds were solicited from such sources as the national endowment 
for the arts and the new york state council for the arts 
and now we have felt ready after being in business since 1825 
to have this large exhibition dobkin said 
about half of the more than 150 paintings and 50 sculptures 
chosen from the 2000item collection have never before been on 
public exhibition 
included in the show are works by such artists as thomas eakins 
winslow homer william merritt chase philip pearlstein and 
alexander stirling calder whose son also named alexander is a 
famous abstract sculptor of mobiles and stabiles 
dobkin estimated the total collection to be worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
no attempts were made to organize the show chronologically or by 
style which can make for somewhat jarring juxtapositions muted 
pastoral scenes are hung next to bold abstracts a study of a row 
of 1950sstyle cars is across the room from tiny portraits and 
stilllifes 
they arent all masterpieces by any means dobkin admits 
but he adds the artists gave these pieces and these are the 
pieces they wanted their fellow artists to judge them by

three bombs exploded today at 
the house of vice presidentelect francisco merino injuring one 
child and causing extensive damage authorities said 
merino and his wife maria antonieta were visiting in the 
united states and were not present at their home in the affluent 
maquilishuat neighborhood of san salvador when the house was 
attacked at dawn 
the couples four young children and three friends were asleep 
in the house when four bombs were thrown over the wall surrounding 
the garden 
one bomb did not explode and experts later defused the device 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack 
but presidentelect alfredo cristiani who visited merinos 
house shortly after the attack blamed the farabundo marti national 
liberation front a leftist rebel organization that has waged a 
civil war against the usbacked government for the last nine 
years 
cristiani told reporters the attack demonstrates that they 
the guerrillas are savages who are not interested in peace but 
only in terrorizing the civilian population i think very little 
can be achieved as far as pacifying the country through dialogue 
with these kind of people 
the master bedroom and dining room were heavily damaged by the 
blasts 
cristiani said one of the friends visiting the merino children 
suffered cuts from the explosions he described the injuries as 
slight 
cristiani and merino both of the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance were elected march 19 and are due to take 
office june 1 from president jose napoleon duartes christian 
democratic administration 
merino was due back in el salvador later today

secretary of state james a baker iii today 
praised the economic reform program in the soviet union but said 
mikhail s gorbachev could be in trouble unless there are 
consumer goods on the table and in the markets 
baker told the american society of newspaper editors that the 
risk to the soviet leader could come from opponents of change 
entrenched elements of the bureaucracy and from sources of 
nationalistic discontent 
he said gorbachevs economic program known in russian as 
perestroika is in the best interest of the united states and the 
world because it would lead to a more secure and stable soviet 
union 
we very much want perestroika to succeed baker said in 
response to a question after a speech we very much want the 
general secretary to succeed 
but baker said political reform in the soviet union is 
proceeding faster than economic reform that might trigger 
something he said these things generally have to proceed 
apace 
baker due to meet with gorbachev and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in moscow may 1011 said there is some 
risk to the soviet leadership 
if they are unable to get the economic part of this going and 
going well so there are consumer goods on the table and in the 
markets thats going to give rise to some feeling on the part of 
some that this idea of perestroika doesnt mean much to the common 
man in the soviet union he said 
baker added i see a chance of it and i think it would be 
unfortunate 
in his speech the us official mixed praise of gorbachev with 
criticism he called again for renunciation of the brezhnev 
doctrine which asserts moscows right to intervene militarily on 
the side of east european governments under internal attack and 
for destruction of the berlin wall which divides east and west in 
europe 
baker also criticized soviet military support to nicaragua and 
the sale of new bombers to libya which he said supports terrorism 
there remain too many areas where the slogans of new thinking 
lack content he said

inconclusive but officials hoped toxicology tests would determine 
how the 1960s radical died friends and family said he had been was 
depressed and may have committed suicide 
hoffman 52 was found dead in his bed by his landlord wednesday 
night 
kate fluehr a spokeswoman for bucks county district attorney 
alan rubenstein said today that the laboratory tests to find the 
cause of death had begun but the results would come sometime next 
week at the earliest 
hoffmans mother said at first that the family assumed hoffman 
had taken his life he sounded very depressed in recent telephone 
conversations with his brother jack 83yearold florence hoffman 
said thursday night 
he had to do what he had to do she said from her worcester 
mass home i dont know why i dont know what happened 
but today she said she was encouraged that the initial autopsy 
was inconclusive and added its very possible that he had a 
heart attack 
rubenstein said an autopsy performed thursday night at 
doylestown hospital failed to uncover the cause of hoffmans death 
mark broderick director of student activities at loyola college 
in baltimore said he also believed hoffman sounded depressed when 
he called to cancel a speaking engagement hours before he was to 
arrive on tuesday 
he said that his mother was dying that he really couldnt 
leave her broderick said 
but mrs hoffman said she had not seen her son in weeks she 
also said she was under treatment for breast cancer but did not 
consider the condition terminal 
michael waldron who rented hoffman an apartment in a 
400footlong converted turkey shed in new hope said hoffman was 
busy with projects and concerned about the environment through his 
last few weeks 
hoffman was very upset about the recent oil spill off the coast 
of alaska and he talked about organizing a boycott of exxon corp 
which is responsible for the massive slick until the spill was 
cleaned up waldron said 
hoffman rose to prominence with the chicago seven a group of 
radicals who stood trial on charges of conspiring to disrupt the 
1968 democratic national convention in chicago he was acquitted of 
conspiracy and a conviction of crossing state lines with intent to 
riot was overturned

the nations worst oil spill is provoking boycotts of some exxon 
stations galvanizing protests from enraged citizens and talk 
jockeys and leading to reports of bomb threats 
its also inspiring some slick jokes 
but the shiploads worth of exxonbashing during the past three 
weeks isnt funny to some gas station operators who quickly point 
out that the public shouldnt equate them with the giant oil 
corporation 
and many station operators maintain theyve witnessed few if 
any effects of organized efforts against exxon corp 
a phoenixbased group calling itself friends of prince william 
sound where the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a charted reef 
and spilled some 101 million gallons of oil turned out about 50 
marchers on tuesday outside a phoenix exxon station carrying signs 
with slogans such as 
exxon sign of the double cross 
an estimated 2000 people held a twohour rally wednesday at 
seattles alki beach to protest the oil spill forcing seattle 
police to close alki avenue the thoroughfare that provides the 
only access to the beach 
radio station kubefm created and promoted the event announcers 
charlie brown and ty flint spent 12 hours broadcasting calls from 
the public about the oil spill four other radio stations joined in 
a simulcast 
on thursday more than 500 people jammed a national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration hearing in seattle that became a forum 
to vent anger over the spill the public meeting was the last of 
four called by the agency to identify issues pertinent to the 
establishment of a national marine sanctuary along the northwest 
coast 
im heartbroken over what happened in alaska said john 
church who pasted up bright red remember valdez signs 
throughout the building i used to fish in cordova and to see 
pictures of those sea otters floating dead in the water is 
heartbreaking i dont want this to happen in washington 
meantime michael siegal of king in seattle is trying to 
generate national interest in a boycott against exxon he has 
appeared on other radio stations around the nation and said he is 
receiving 200 letters a day many with cutup exxon credit cards 
at radio station karn in little rock ark talk show host pat 
lynch said thursday that he has had guests on twice this week to 
discuss the alaska spill and he found listeners were livid 
listeners are just plain upset and there is i think an 
unusual sense of rage he said i think it hinges on two 
things one of which is the out and out undisguised greed of price 
increases coming at this time and also the certain knowledge that 
the consumer will bear the cost of the valdez cleanup 
in los angeles morning show host peter tilden of klsxfm a 
rock n roll station solicited volunteers to help in the cleanup 
he also asked listeners to slice exxon credits cards and boycott 
the oil company 
to others in radio and television the issue has been a laughing 
matter 
exxon sprung into action immediately and sent in their crack 
cleanup crew a guy named raoul with a squeegee and a dirty rag 
johnny carson joked recently on nbctvs the tonight show 
he also quipped i dont think exxons new slogan helps at 
all exxon were not as bad as union carbide 
but all joking aside wayne konitshek managing director of the 
colorado service station dealers association said three bomb 
threats and two protests have been reported at exxon service 
stations since last weekend 
he said the association is attempting to make the public aware 
of the difference between independently owned stations and company 
owned stations 
independent dealers he said are as innocent as the otters in 
alaska 
nonetheless many station operators from maine to california 
said it was business as usual in the wake of the spill others 
attributed any decline in sales to a recent increase in prices at 
the pump 
richard brown manager of an exxon station in suburban new 
orleans said some customers have threatened to stop buying gas in 
protest of the oil spill and the rising price of fuel 
but theres really been no decrease in business he added 
tom hamilton a mechanic at daves bustleton exxon in 
philadelphia said some customers have asked about a recent 6 cents 
per gallon increase in the price but none has commented seriously 
about the spill 
they say some things about it in jest he said 
for its part exxon responded to two consumer groups boycott 
call earlier this week with a statement issued from its new york 
headquarters reiterating its regret about the oil spill 
all of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that 
our effort in alaska will convince them that we continue to be a 
responsible company and one people like to do business with 
exxon said

chads government says it thwarted a rebellion 
against president hissene habre and sudan said the three leaders 
of the attempted coup escaped to the neighboring african nation 
sudanese soldiers were moved to the border with chad and were 
disarming chadian troopers who had crossed the border a sudanese 
official said 
chads government identified the plotters as hassan djamous 
commanderinchief of the armed forces idriss debi his 
predecessor in the post and interior minister ibrahim mahamat itno 
the government in a communique released thursday night through 
the chadian embassy in paris said the coup leaders entered into 
rebellion against the institutions of the republic on the night 
of april 12 
the communique said the armed forces were ordered to destroy 
the plotters and put an end to the rebellion by annihilation 
it described the coup leaders as individuals motivated and 
manipulated by overwhelming ambition 
asked about the fate of the ringleaders the chadian embassy 
only would say the plot had been uncovered and its authors and 
accomplices rendered harmless 
diplomatic sources in ndjamena capital of the northern african 
nation said april 5 that itno was arrested and that djamous and 
debi had disappeared 
the sources also said military movements occurred in the capital 
the weekend of april 13 and that people trying to get in or out of 
the city were stopped at roadblocks 
in a report from ndjamena the french news agency agence 
francepresse quoted unidentified sources as saying djamous and 
debi were wounded tuesday in fighting with troops who had pursued 
them across the border into sudans darfur province it said 
djamous was taken prisoner but debi escaped in a statement 
released thursday night in khartoum the governor of the province 
tigani sysi said the itno djamous and debi crossed into sudan a 
week ago 
the sudanese armed forces general command issued a statement 
saying chadian soldiers had intruded into darfur and that sudanese 
soldiers were sent there for security and to expel the chadians 
the statement gave no number for the chadian intruders but a 
magazine aladwaa said 2000 chadian soldiers crossed over 
following the coup attempt 
the sudanese governor confirmed the presence of chadian forces 
in his region but said sudanese troopers were disarming the 
chadian soldiers 
itno took a leading role in negotiations which led to the habre 
governments reconciliation with numerous political oppponents who 
had been engaged in a drawn out civil war with the government 
itno also joined in negotations that led to the 1987 pact with 
rebel leader acheik ibn omar who was appointed foreign minister 
earlier this year 
habre has ruled chad since 1982 when he ousted a libyanbacked 
government led by goukouni oueddei 
libya maintained troops in northern chad and supported chadian 
factions opposed to habre until 1987 when a stunning chadian 
military offensive drove the libyans out 
col moammar gadhafi libyas leader then recognized habres 
government and agreed to a ceasefire although a permanent 
settlement has proved elusive and occasional clashes have been 
reported 
habre has tried to unite the many rebellious factions in the 
country sometimes through repression and sometimes by making pacts 
that gave the rebel leaders important posts in his government

the communist party chief of soviet georgia 
resigned today in an emergency meeting about violent nationalist 
demonstrations in the southern republic and he was replaced by the 
local kgb chief officials said 
gennady gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman told 
reporters in moscow the georgian party leader first secretary 
dzhumber i patiashvili offered his resignation and the central 
committee accepted it 
givi g gumbaridze 45 who has been georgias kgb chief for two 
months was named to replace patiashvili said zhorab lomidze 
deputy director of the official georgian news agency gruzinform 
the committee also removed two other members of georgias ruling 
politburo premier zurab chkheidze and president otari cherkeziya 
gerasimov said 
that means they lose their seats on the top party body but they 
remain premier and president he said they voiced a desire to 
leave their government posts but it is not a question that is to 
be resolved by the plenary party meeting gerasimov said 
however lomidze said cherkeziya had not been removed from the

drexel burnham lambert inc faces federal 
supervision and a future without financier michael milken in its 
outofcourt settlement with the securities and exchange commission 
over wall streets biggestever securities fraud case 
the agreement thursday resolved civil charges that included 
insider trading in more than 20 alleged fraud schemes and marked 
another milestone in the governments crackdown on whitecollar 
corruption 
it also cleared the way for drexel to plead guilty to six felony 
counts and pay a record 650 million in fines and restitution in a 
separate settlement of criminal charges with the manhattan us 
attorneys office 
separately milken agreed today to set aside more than 600 
million in assets that could be forfeited if he is found guilty of 
charges in a sweeping fraud and racketeering charges that names 
him his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce newberg 
the assets are being set aside under an agreement between 
defense attorneys and federal prosecutors who could have sought to 
freeze all of the milkens assets pending the outcome of their 
trials 
michael and lowell milken who himself agreed to set aside 50 
million in assets also each agreed to post 1 million bail 
secured by other assets in order to remain free pending trial 
newberg is scheduled to be arraigned april 25 
on thursday sec chairman david s ruder called the drexel 
settlement reached after four months of oftenbitter negotiations 
the most farreaching relief ever obtained by the commission 
against a major regulated entity 
drexel the nations fifthlargest securities firm agreed to 
submit to extensive monitoring by the sec for three years set up a 
securities compliance watchdog committee and a disciplinary panel 
and appoint a new chairman general counsel ombudsman and 
accounting chief subject to sec approval 
in addition drexel agreed to terminate all relations with 
milken who helped transform drexel into a wall street powerhouse 
by peddling highrisk securities known as junk bonds and to bar 
its employees from direct or indirect business dealings with him 
the settlement also ensures drexels cooperation in any future 
government investigations 
we think it achieves everything thats needed for the 
protection of the investing public sec enforcement director gary 
lynch said it will also give us the ability to bring other 
people to justice that might not be brought to justice if we had 
stayed at war for another three to five years 
milken could be rehired only if he is exonerated of all 98 
racketeering and fraud charges filed by the government in a 
separate indictment that seeks 18 billion in forfeitures from him 
and two others 
drexel and milken have been the main government targets since 
the ivan boesky insider trading scandal of 1986 boesky now in 
federal prison has been a leading source of evidence against 
drexel milken and others 
drexel said in a summary of the agreement that it was paying the 
largest penalties ever in a securities case and making 
comprehensive and unprecedented structural changes that place 
the private firm under tight scrutiny 
we expect that as a result of this settlement agreement and 
other steps we will take drexel will become the standard in the 
securities industry said drexel chief executive frederick h 
joseph 
drexel which said it lost an estimated 2 billion in business 
during the governments investigation and spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars defending itself also immediately named as its 
chairman john sr shad who started the drexel probe during his 
198187 term as sec chairman 
in addition drexel will pay 15 million in civil penalties an 
amount already accounted for under the total 650 million in 
penalties it has agreed to pay the government 
the 184page sec complaint filed last september described 21 
alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 and portrayed 
drexel milken and others as systematic cheaters who engaged in 
stock manipulation insider trading and other frauds 
the pact still must be approved by us district judge milton 
pollack who temporarily has been barred from any rulings in the 
case while the us supreme court considers whether to hear a 
defense request to remove him because of an alleged conflict of 
interest

several members of the senate foreign 
relations committee have privately raised doubts with the bush 
administration about the nomination of donald gregg to be 
ambassador to south korea because of his possible role in the 
irancontra affair congressional sources friday 
however secretary of state james baker iii has reiterated his 
support for greggs nomination to the highprofile diplomatic by 
president bush greggs former boss 
greggs nomination which will be debated by the senate 
committee next month is one of several that have run into 
opposition in the light of disclosures about the irancontra affair 
that have surfaced in the trial of former white house aide oliver 
north 
on thursday michael armacost bushs nominee for ambasasdor to 
japan ran into questioning about documents indicating he attended 
a 1985 meeting at which it was decided to release military aid to 
honduras in return for that nations continued backing of the 
nicaraguan contras 
armacost denied attending that meeting but promised to search 
his records and report back to the panel the congressional sources 
said friday that armacost who served in the no 3 post at the 
state department in the reagan administration will tell the 
committee he was invited to attend the white house meeting but did 
not go 
also on thursday sen alan cranston dcalif called baker to 
ask that greggs nomination for south korea be withdrawn said 
congressional sources commenting only on condition they not be 
named margaret tutwiler bakers spokeswoman confirmed that 
cranston called the secretary but declined to say why 
baker then talked to gregg and the status of the nomination 
remains the same the president supports his nominee she said 
friday 
when bush was vice president gregg was his national security 
adviser his name is mentioned in several documents that became 
public during the 1987 congressional investigation of the 
irancontra affair 
the final report from that investigation says that gregg a 
former cia official knew that north was directing the contra 
supply effort at a time when official us aid was banned but 
that he contended he did not tell bush 
another nomination facing some opposition is that of john 
negroponte as ambassador to mexico negroponte was ambassador to 
honduras from 1981 to 1985 and some democrats want to know whether 
he was involved in the inducements promised the honduran government 
in exchange for its support of the contras

the prosecution rested today without 
calling a key witness in the trial of a christian science couple 
accused of murder and abuse in the death of their daughter from 
untreated diabetes 
william and christine hermanson are charged with thirddegree 
murder and felony child abuse in the sept 30 1986 death of 
7yearold amy after seeking the aid of spiritual healers but not 
doctors 
defense attorneys were successful today in blocking the 
testimony of a witness who had said with the jury out of the 
courtroom that the hermansons had gotten medical help when they 
needed it but didnt seek insulin injections that could have saved 
their daughters life 
attorney charles arnold said the surprise testimony late 
thursday violated state rules of discovery requiring lawyers to 
notify the other side of damaging testimony expected to be 
introduced 
after the prosecution acknowledged the defense hadnt been told 
about the witness sarasota circuit judge stephen dakan reversed 
himself and ruled today that the testimony was inadmissible 
the witness mary christman said thursday that she visited the 
hermansons three days after amys death and learned william 
hermanson previously had taken novocain for a tooth problem 
his wife suggested she had anesthesia during childbirth mrs 
christman testified without the jury present 
i said god chris if bill had novocain and you had two 
caesarean sections which ive had myself how could you have done 
that without any anesthetic mrs christman testified 
mrs hermanson replied well that was a different 
situation she said 
the couple is accused of thirddegree murder and child abuse in 
amys death in 1986 prosecutors say the parents turned to 
spiritual healing and prayer instead of medical attention that 
could have saved amys life 
the defense says the issue is religious freedom and cites a 
state law exempting parents who have religious beliefs against 
medical treatment from neglect charges the hermansons say they 
were following christian science doctrine when they relied on 
practitioners of spiritual healing for the childs recovery 
i was frustrated and baffled when a simple shot of insulin 
would have saved her life she looked like a refugee from a 
death camp mrs christman said mrs hermanson said amy felt 
no pain there was no illness it was negative transfers that she 
was picking up from other people 
mrs hermanson contended amys body would have rejected insulin 
because her husbands body rejected novocain mrs christman 
testified 
three times thursday mrs hermanson broke down and cried 
quietly at the defense table during the testimony of her daughters 
teacher laura kingsley the teacher said amy was once bright and 
creative but turned lethargic 
another witness helen falb an employee at the hermansons 
academy said that amy looked skeletal a few weeks before her 
death and said she had been vomiting and unable to sleep ms falb 
said she did not tell the parents about the conversation 
i knew about their religion and i know they wrote my paycheck 
and i didnt want to create a stir she testified 
a 1975 florida law states that parents who withhold medical 
treatment for religious reasons cannot be considered abusive or 
neglectful to their children 
five similar cases are pending nationwide

lend you a coat when you go in without one 
the lawmakers garish coats ranged from red plaids to greens to 
a sky blue number with navy velvet collar and lapels that was worn 
by rep jerry yost 
all provided fodder for jokes 
i had a 1948 ford when i was in high school these were the 
seat covers rep richard smith said of his red plaid jacket he 
later admitted to having worn it while being sworn in as a city 
councilman in the 1970s

sport coat problem he said i can understand looking at some 
of these sport coats why you all are wearing dark blue all the

the state department responding to a call by 
a group of senators today registered its opposition to any effort 
to grant the palestine liberation organization membership status in 
the united nations 
in our view the selfdeclared palestinian state which we do 
not recognize does not meet the generally accepted international 
law criteria for statehood a department statement said it added 
that the plo does not qualify for membership in un agencies 
the 38 senators had urged secretary of state james a baker iii 
on thursday to oppose un recognition of the plo as a member 
state an upgrading of its current observer status 
any successful move by the un or related agencies to 
recognize the state of palestine would force us to seriously 
consider a range of punitive action including withholding us 
financial participation from those agencies the lawmakers said 
in a letter 
sen robert w kasten jr rwis and those who joined him said 
the plo was engaged in a public relations ploy to make 
headlines rather than confidencebuilding measures to make 
progress 
the senators said yasser arafats group should not be treated as 
a state because it does not control territory or any population and 
is not a government 
the state department responded today that the united states is 
ooposed to efforts to grant the plo rights and privileges exceeding 
its status as an observer organization within the un system 
the statement which was issued by the press office said the 
united states does not recognize the selfdeclared palestinian 
state 
to gain recognition as a member state the plo would have to 
apply to the security council where the united states is one of 
the five permanent members with veto power 
if the united states did not block the plos application 
twothirds of the 159 general assembly members would then have to 
vote for its admission as a member state 
baker testifying thursday before a senate appropriations 
subcommittee told kasten he had not seen the letter he said the 
united states would continue its talks with the plo despite 
statements by some plo elements that appeared to challenge israels 
right to exist 
baker also said the willingness of israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir to consider holding elections on the west bank and 
in gaza followed by negotiations on a permanent settlement was a 
new and hopeful idea that should be fully explored 
sen warren rudman rnh read several recent statements by 
plo officials that he said seemed to suggest they remain committed 
to the creation of a palestinian state and the destruction of 
israel 
statements such as those are clearly not helpful baker 
said we do look at statements such as that very carefully 
because we want to continue the dialogue with the plo under the 
conditions under which they were started 
but he said that the plo is composed of many dissident 
elements some of which are opposed to any dialogue with the united 
states and some which have not renounced terrorism 
to date we are satisfied that the plo is committed to what it 
has told us that it recognizes israels right to exist and that it 
has renounced terrorism in all of its forms baker said 
baker said shamirs proposal to hold elections among palestinian 
arabs on the west bank and in gaza was new different and 
significant 
he said the united states would encourage shamir egyptian 
president hosni mubarak and jordans king hussein who will be here 
for talks next week to preserve flexibility so that the options 
may be explored and if possible capitalized upon 
responding to questions baker said it would be difficult to 
conduct elections if the violence associated with the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories continues 
surely there has to be a greater degree of calm or tranquility 
before you get to elections he said 
bakers chief deputy meantime told a jewish audience the plo 
may be sincere in its declaration that it no longer seeks to 
destroy israel 
the evidence is mixed deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger told leaders of the united jewish appeal 
at the moment the jury is out he said when asked at a 
luncheon whether he believed statements by arafat in december that 
the organization supported israels right to exist 
there are questions that need to be answered it is no longer 
clear in either direction said eagleburger traditionally a 
strong supporter of israel

the house of yves saint laurent is undergoing a 
major managerial restructuring but company officials say the 
king of couture will remain in control of creation if not in 
top form 
company chairman pierre berge said the reorganization will give 
him absolute management authority while saint laurent himself 
stays on as the couturier 
in an interview friday berge brusquely dismissed rumors about 
the health of the 52yearold saint laurent 
i give you my word of honor that he has neither cancer nor 
aids for which he is not even seropositive berge said he is 
working at home in paris right now 
berge said the company is being restructured to avoid any 
possibility of an unfriendly takeover well into the next century 
overall with couture readytowear perfume and accessories 
sales the ysl empire is estimated to be worth nearly 2 billion 
we have an eye on the future hoping to go public on the 
french stock market by 1990 berge added 
for several seasons the reclusive saint laurent has been 
refusing interviews and looking lessthanhealthy as he walks or 
sometimes staggers on runways after shows 
saint laurents swollen appearance facial tics and difficulty 
walking have given rise to speculation about his health 
theres nothing new about saint laurents illness berge 
said its been talked about for 15 years everyone knows he has 
had psychological problems that he takes too many tranquilizers 
and that he sometimes looks somewhat confused 
the company has a big insurance policy for him and four times 
a year he must have a complete physical checkup basically he is 
ok 
berge confirming a report in the wall street journal said that 
when the saint laurent company goes public on the french stock 
market it will in effect create a new company 
management will be headed by four men saint laurent berge 
alain minc head of italian financier carlo de benedettis french 
holding company and jeanfrancis bretelle managing director of 
yves saint laurent sa 
i have a special role said berge 58 in france we will 
have a legal status that does not exist in america i believe it 
will be a societe en commandite par actions that basically means 
that no matter what stockholders vote i alone will have the last 
word 
when asked if that means he will he become the absolute dictator 
of the ysl operation in france berge replied thats right at 
last at last 
at the moment saint laurent and berge are majority 
shareholders which they became when they bought back the saint 
laurent perfume business two years ago from the squibb corp 
backed by de benedetti and his associates 
berge and saint laurent have been associated since they started 
their fledgling fashion house in 1961 
they first met and became friends after saint laurents 
sensational 1958 trapeze line collection for christian dior as 
saint laurent age 21 took over designing for the dior empire 
following the couturiers death in 1957 
saint laurent came to paris in 1954 from his birthplace in oran 
algeria and was soon introduced by michel de brunhoff the editor 
of vogue to christian dior he was so impressed by saint laurents 
sketches he hired him on the spot as an assistant 
since the beginning saint laurent has had a powerful impact on 
fashion he was the first couturier to make elegant trousers for 
women starting with the tuxedo suits of 1966 still a saint 
laurent trademark 
since then he has put women into sophisticated versions of 
russian fete clothes chinese arab or indianinspired styles 
ruffled babydoll dresses outfits based on works by modern painters 
like mondrian and picasso and more 
from his youthful days he became a classic designer with an 
unerring contemporary fashion sense a feeling for what chic women 
want to wear

a national council of churches delegation 
met with pope john paul ii on friday capping five days of talks 
aimed at strengthening relations between the roman catholic church 
and other christian denominations in the united states 
the 11member delegation representing various anglican 
protestant and orthodox churches included four ordained women 
the roman catholic church bars women priests and the pope on 
several occasions has warned that ordination of women in the 
anglican communion which includes the us episcopal church poses 
serious obstacles to christian unity 
delegation leaders said ordination of women was not raised in 
the meetings noting there are divisions among the noncatholic 
us churches themselves on the issue they said however that the 
women delegates were treated with respect by the pope and other 
vatican officials 
we have been treated very well said the president of the 
council the rev patricia a mcclurg an ordained presbyterian 
minister we found that we all share the same faith 
noting that the pope cited the angels message to the women at 
christs tomb mcclurg said i found that as a sign of respect 
for women 
the pope recalled his meeting with christian leaders in 
columbia sc during his 1987 visit to the united states and said 
all christians must walk the path of reconciliation 
i am confident that as we seek to remain ever faithful to the 
lord the cause of ecumenism in the united states will steadily 
progress he added 
delegation leaders said the visit the first by the council to 
the vatican since 1969 was intended primarily to strengthen 
relations between the group and the us catholic bishops 
conference and to learn how the vatican curia the churchs central 
administration works

a county judge today ordered east st 
louis mayor carl officer and the city attorney to jail after 
finding them in contempt of court for failing to appear at an 
earlier hearing 
your honor i was suffering from the effects of the flu 
officer said attempting to explain to st clair county judge 
sheila obrien why he did not appear before her march 31 to discuss 
his citys leaking sewer system 
the jailing order was the latest in a series of confrontations 
and financial problems for the povertystricken city of 55000 
across the river from st louis 
this is the most bizarre and outrageous situation i have ever 
seen in a court of law city attorney eric vickers said shouting 
as he challenged the judges order it is obvious this court has 
no sense of fairness and decency 
dont fight with me mr vickers the judge responded 
youre picking a fight you will not win she set bond at 3500 
for each of the two men on the sixmonth jail sentence 
accusing east st louis officials of callous disregard for 
the courts orders ms obrien also reinstated an order of march 3 
that the city post a 500000 bond to guarantee that its sewers 
will be fixed in 90 days 
the order also requires the city to pay the costs of the lawyers 
who took the sewage system complaints to court earlier she had 
dropped those requirements at vickers request 
at the heart of the controversy is a twoacre pond at the villa 
green housing project which has filled with raw sewage and was 
ordered drained by the judge by early march 
at the march 31 hearing however east st louis public works 
director jesse walker told ms obrien that his employees were 
pumping sewage around the clock to keep it from backing into the 
villa griffin pond but a shortage of machines and manpower was 
hindering progress 
sheila shunick a lawyer for tenants at the villa griffin 
housing project requested that the city show cause why it should 
not be held in contempt ms obrien granted her request 
ms obrien has been holding hearings at twoweek intervals on 
the citys progress in stemming the flow of sewage from leaking or 
blocked pipes

the agriculture department said friday it has 
approved the first field test of a genetically engineered cotton 
plant that protects itself from destructive insects 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said permission was given to the 
agracetus co middleton wis for testing the new cotton variety 
in starkville miss beginning immediately 
glosser said the testing procedure was reviewed by his agency 
and determined to be well designed and environmentally safe 
the companys scientists inserted a gene into the cotton plant 
from a common soil bacterium bacillus thuringienensis the gene 
produces a protein that is toxic to caterpillartype insects but 
not to humans mammals or most other insects 
glosser said if the cotton performs as the company hopes it 
would mean the plants are protected against such pests as the 
bollworm tobacco budworm and armyworm the department estimates 
these pests cost us cotton producers about 128 million in 1988 
including lost yields and costs of insecticides

un agencies are preparing a 40 million 
program to assist 70000 somalis displaced from their homes by war 
officials said friday 
un agencies have been asked to submit a report on the program 
to the office of undersecretarygeneral abdulrahim farah by april 
24 said agency officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
somalia has a population of 53 million and is one of the 
poorest nations in the world 
the government of president mohammed siad barre has been 
battling a rebellion by the somali national movement for seven 
years in the north of the country 
in addition a war broke out between ethiopia and somalia in 
1977 for control of the ogaden region 
about 70000 somalis are displaced in their own nation 
because they have not crossed any borders they have not been 
assisted by the un high commissioner for refugees 
that genevabased un agency has spent 60 million to 70 
million in each of the last 10 years to assist ethiopians in 
somalia and somalis who sought refuge in ethiopia 
somalia says there are 840000 refugees in ethiopia some 
refugee officials believe the true number is closer to 400000 
somalia also receives much us aid expected to reach 55 
million in fiscal year 1989 because the united states has signed 
agreements under which the us military may use somali bases in 
the event of conflict in the middle east 
the united states already has a large naval base at the somali 
port of berbera on the gulf of aden

education secretary lauro cavazos on friday 
urged newspaper editors to support public school improvement 
efforts saying such help is vital 
im really here to enlist your help cavazos told the 
american society of newspaper editors we must have your support 
in these endeavors if they are to be successful 
cavazos said high dropout rates low test scores drug abuse and 
a high degree of adult illiteracy mean the nation is beyond the 
at risk description in a 1983 report and already in trouble 
newspapers should urge more parental involvement in school 
management and educational decisions more teacher responsibility 
and more focus on early childhood education he said they should 
also insist on curricular reform and should promote university 
efforts to help primary and secondary schools he added 
cavazos also urged the editors to support some of the education 
priorities of the bush administration among them educational 
deregulation that would allow the waiving of federal regulations 
in some districts with innovative reform plans and public school 
choice programs that let parents decide which school their children 
will attend 
the secretary said open choice and competition have helped 
higher education in the united states and could do the same at 
lower levels 
but he cautioned that any public school choice program must be 
very very sensitive to equity in the system particularly 
concerning minorities and the disadvantaged who may live near 
substandard schools by improving ghetto schools and making 
transportation available to students who opt to go elsewhere 
where schools are clearly unacceptable cavazos said during 
questioning the state ought to take them over get them in 
better shape or close them down this country should not tolerate 
thirdrate schools 
in response to a question from asne president john seigenthaler 
editor and publisher of the nashville tennessean cavazos stressed 
that the schoolchoice plans favored by the administration involve 
competition only among public schools 
we are not prepared to move ahead in the federal 
government into giving parents vouchers which they could use at 
private schools he said at this time we have not moved into the 
private school area

tanks and armored vehicles rumbled through three 
restive cities in the baltics this week frightening residents 
already shaken by a fatal clash between the military and 
demonstrators in soviet georgia activists and journalists said 
friday 
military officials said it was only a training exercise and the 
heavy armor did nothing more threatening than drive around but the 
timing frightened and infuriated residents of riga tallinn and 
tartu journalists said 
in addition a monstrous number of troops appeared monday 
and tuesday in tashkent the capital of uzbekistan in soviet 
central asia following a nationalist meeting sunday according to 
moscow activist viktor rezunkov there were no tanks and no curfew 
he added 
residents of downtown riga the capital of latvia woke up 
monday to the thunder of tank treads on the cobblestones said alex 
grigoriev editor of the popular front newspaper atmoda or 
awakening they looked out their windows to find 1020 tanks and 
other armored vehicles rolling down the street at full speed with 
guns aimed both forward and sideways at them grigoriev said 
there was panic and indignation he said it was seen as a 
provocation and an effort to exert pressure 
ivar kezbers a secretary of the latvian communist party 
appeared on television in riga on thursday to join the public 
complaints and deny military claims that local officials had been 
warned about the maneuvers said mikhail bonden correspondent for 
unofficial journal expresskhronika 
five tanks were seen thursday on the streets of tartu estonias 
university city shortly before a large student demonstration 
against military service said tartu resident petr vikhalem 
fridays tartu newspapers said the tanks had lagged behind their 
unit which passed through the city during the night vikhalem 
said but people assumed the tanks appearance was related to the 
demonstration he said 
armored personnel carriers were seen in the estonian capital of 
tallinn on friday about three miles from downtown said tarmu 
tammerk of the newspaper kodumaa or homeland 
estonian radio journalist sulev hallik said he had seen no 
unusual military activities even though his office is located near 
tallinns tank regiment its warm here but without tanks he 
said 
no explanation was given immediately for the vehicles tammerk 
reported but hallik said military vehicles sometimes pass through 
the citys outskirts 
an editor at estonian tv said friday he had heard nothing of any 
tanks foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said he knew 
nothing about it 
all three cities have had demonstrations drawing tens of 
thousands of people demanding greater autonomy estonias 
parliament last fall declared the republic sovereign and gave 
itself the right to overturn soviet laws 
but activists in the baltics have taken great pains to prevent 
violence that could be used to justify the imposition of martial 
law there have been tense moments between baltic natives and 
russians but no violence for at least six months 
the tanks in riga were the most obvious taking up stations at 
major downtown intersections for two days grigoriev said lt gen 
fyodor kuzmin commander of the baltic military district said on 
latvian tv the tanks were on maneuvers grigoriev reported 
the general said they were training but for what would they 
be training in downtown riga asked grigoriev people feared the 
troops might be preparing to put down demonstrations in riga as 
they did in georgia he said 
on sunday troops charged georgian proindependence 
demonstrators rallying in the capital of tbilisi and at least 19 
people were killed 
its rather strange that right after georgia there would be 
tanks on the streets of riga for the first time since the 1940s 
said bonden 
the tanks appearance coincided with a discussion by the latvian 
government of a proposed law requiring public sector workers to 
speak latvian that bill is opposed by the interfront movement 
a group of russian nationalists who successfully backed kuzmins 
election to the new soviet parliament bonden said 
kuzmin said the tank exercises had been planned for some time 
and local authorities had been forewarned grigoriev said but 
kezbers the party official denied that on latvian tv thursday and 
called the action a mistake by the soldiers grigoriev said 
kezbers called the presence of troops in riga the day after the 
tragedy in georgia and parliamentary runoff elections 
unhealthy bonden said 
the dozen armored personnel carriers appeared briefly in tartu 
shortly after noon thursday hours before a longplanned student 
demonstration demanding the right to do their military service in 
estonia tammerk said such protests have been held almost daily in 
estonia recently due to growing maltreatment of estonian 
conscripts in the army 
they are being labeled fascists even by officers he said 
letters in newspapers have offered horrific accounts of 
torture sexual abuse and beatings he said 
estonian president arnold ruutel and premier indrek toome wrote 
thursday to the soviet presidium and defense minister dmitri t 
yazov proposing that estonians be permitted to perform their 
military service in one of the baltic republics tammerk said

testimony in oliver norths irancontra trial 
ended today and the judge said the jury will be isolated when it 
starts considering norths fate toward the end of next week 
it seems to us both sides feel its appropriate to sequester 
during the deliberations said us district judge gerhard a 
gesell 
opening statements in the trial took place feb 21 and 48 people 
have testified since then gesell said final arguments will begin 
tuesday with the jury to be sequestered starting wednesday night 
at the earliest 
one of the prosecutions final witnesses today was a former 
national security council official who said north then an nsc 
aide was so pinched for money that he complained about not having 
enough to buy lunch and gasoline 
but norths complaints suddenly stopped in mid1985 said mary 
dix who was the nscs director of administration by that time 
north was controlling a secret cash fund run out of his office safe 
intended to provide covert aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the fund was financed by contra leader adolfo calero and former 
air force maj gen richard secord 
the prosecution is seeking to portray north as a career military 
officer who became moneyhungry while working at the nsc 
north is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 home security 
system from secord in 1986 and of converting to his own use 4300 
in travelers checks out of the secret stash he kept in the office 
safe 
ms dix testified that north then a marine lieutenant colonel 
complained on five occasions through mid1985 that he was strapped 
for cash 
on a few occasions in the hallway as she was going home north 
would run after her yelling mary mary she recalled she said 
that he would need cash to go home complaining that he didnt 
have enough to buy gasoline 
in other instances colonel north would get very upset if 
the petty cash box for paying cab fare was empty ms dix said 
when north wasnt reimbursed rapidly enough for office expenses 
he would be pretty frantic in trying to get nsc staffers to 
process his expense accounts to turn them around as soon as 
possible 
he said his credit cards were charged to the max she said 
on a few other occasions while she was in her office he would 
run by his face was red he was very upset with my 
staff about not being reimbursed fast enough 
i would herd him from my area she recalled 
north said at one point that there was not enough for cash to 
go home and not enough for lunch money she testified 
prosecutor david zornow asked if norths complaining stopped 
it stopped to the best of my recollection in mid1985 ms 
dix replied 
north testified monday that the 3000 balance on a used gmc 
suburban vehicle he bought in october 1985 was paid from money he 
kept in a metal box in a closet at his home 
but the salesman who sold the vehicle william howell testified 
today that north said he was going to get the money from the white 
house credit union 
it was my understanding that the money was to come from the 
white house credit union the balance howell said 
from february to may 1985 secord who had been enlisted by 
north to run weapons to the nicaraguan rebels arranged four 
private sales of arms for the contras 
some 90000 to 100000 from calero was funneled through 
norths office safe as well as 150000 to 200000 in cash from 
secord north said he destroyed the ledger detailing how the money 
was spent on orders from cia director william casey 
in testimony monday north said he paid off the 3038 balance 
on the 8038 vehicle four days after making the down payment 
prosecutor john keker asked north whether he got 3000 in cash 
that day from secord whose office is a mile or two from the car 
lot in virginia 
north said he got a lot of money from general secord on a lot 
of occasions and didnt remember that particular day

exxon corp has sent the alaska public 
radio network more than 32000 for expenses the 24station network 
has incurred in news coverage of the exxon valdez oil spill 
the checks in the mail exxon spokesman jan cool said 
thursday aprn will decide how the money will be distributed to 
the stations that covered it 
susan braine acting executive director said network officials 
decided it was ethical to accept exxon money for coverage of a 
story in which the oil company is involved 
exxon has underwritten our programs in the past she said 
a lot of the oil companies have supported us it doesnt mean 
that we wont report anything negative about them 
in many of alaskas small towns and villages the networks 
member station is the only or primary source of news the stations 
are heavily subsidized by the state through the alaska public 
broadcasting commission and also rely on underwriting and 
donations 
but unlike underwriting in which a company or other benefactor 
provides money for the network to spend as it wishes exxons 
contribution is being made after the fact for coverage of a 
specific news event involving the company 
thats an interesting ethical question that i havent ever 
heard of before said frank wetzel ombudsman for the seattle 
times 
wetzel said in a telephone interview that the ethical dilemma is 
eased somewhat by the fact that network reporters already have 
covered the spill without knowing that exxon would be paying for 
the coverage 
but i wonder about the future he said will there be some 
very subjective withholding of criticism of exxon now that the 
reporters and producers know that their work is being financed by 
exxon its a pretty close question i think 
cool said that while the situation is unique exxon 
considers the money just one contribution out of many it makes 
routinely she discounted suggestions that the networks 
objectivity might be compromised 
they certainly havent been proexxon in their coverage 
cool said we did this really as a public service for the people 
of alaska who wanted to know the state of the oil spill 
exxon made the contribution after officials learned the network 
had asked rep mike davis to submit a supplemental state budget 
request for the 32283 cool said 
the network has maintained roundtheclock coverage of the 
spill sending six reporters and one technician to prince william 
sound in the three weeks since the tanker exxon valdez ran aground 
braine said the network would welcome additional money from 
exxon if it was offered 
wetzel however questioned the wisdom of accepting exxons 
money when its earmarked for spill coverage 
if exxon wanted to make a general contribution that would be 
one thing he said but it has the earmarks of financing 
coverage of your own mess

adm william j crowe chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said friday he will travel to the soviet union in 
june the first modernday visit by such an officer 
us and soviet officials are still working on the exact date 
and other details according to crowe who made the announcement 
during testimony to the senate armed services committee 
the visit is part of an exchange in which marshal sergei f 
akhromeyev the soviet unions first deputy minister of defense and 
chief of general staff traveled to the united states last july 
akhromeyev visited north carolina texas oklahoma and south dakota 
this is a very positive development said sen john warner 
of virginia ranking republican on the committee he noted that the 
panel has advocated more exchange between our senior military 
officers in terms of visits and meetings with the senior soviet 
military 
in the past high us and soviet military officials have met in 
connection with world war ii conferences in berlin and yalta said 
pentagon officials 
during fridays hearing on a wide range of issues crowe also 
said defense secretary dick cheney is facing some gutwrenching 
decisions on the budget meanwhile congressional leaders joined 
president bush at the white house to announce a 28 billion 
deficitreduction plan 
the agreement calls for restraining overall fiscal 1990 growth 
in military programs to below the rate of inflation the pentagon 
would be held to about 299 billion in outlays virtually the same 
as this year military spending authority which includes 
commitments that span more than one fiscal year would be about 
3055 billion 
this is going to be a tough tough puzzle for the defense 
department and it is going to require some reductions in some of

in the three weeks since the alaskan oil spill irate consumers 
have been cutting up their exxon cards comedians have been 
savaging the petroleum giant and environmental groups have used 
the disaster to galvanize protest 
many gas station operators say however that theyve witnessed 
few effects of an organized boycott against exxon corp they are 
quick to add that the public should not hold them responsible 
radio announcers have been particularly vocal about the spill 
and encouraging listeners to take action 
station kubefm for example organized and promoted a twohour 
rally wednesday at seattles alki beach to protest the spill 
announcers charlie brown and ty flint spent 12 hours broadcasting 
calls from the public about the oil spill four other radio 
stations joined in a simulcast 
an estimated 2000 people attended the rally forcing seattle 
police to close the only access to the beach 
meantime michael siegal of king in seattle is trying to 
generate national interest in a boycott he has appeared on other 
radio stations around the nation and said he is receiving 200 
letters a day many with cutup exxon credit cards 
elsewhere in seattle more than 500 people jammed a national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration hearing thursday that became 
a forum to vent anger over the spill the meeting was the last of 
four called by the agency to identify issues pertinent to the 
establishment of a national marine sanctuary along the northwest 
coast 
im heartbroken over what happened in alaska said john 
church who pasted up bright red remember valdez signs 
throughout the building valdez is the exxon tanker that ran 
aground on a charted reef march 24 in prince william sound 
spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil 
at radio station karn in little rock ark talk show host pat 
lynch said thursday that he has had guests on twice this week to 
discuss the alaska spill 
listeners are just plain upset and there is i think an 
unusual sense of rage he said i think it hinges on two 
things one of which is the out and out undisguised greed of price 
increases coming at this time and also the certain knowledge that 
the consumer will bear the cost of the valdez cleanup 
in los angeles morning show host peter tilden of rock station 
klsxfm solicited volunteers to help in the cleanup he also asked 
listeners to slice exxon credits cards and boycott the oil company 
to others in radio and television the issue has generated slick 
jokes 
on nbctvs the tonight show host johnny carson said i 
dont think exxons new slogan helps at all exxon were not as 
bad as union carbide 
but joking aside wayne konitshek managing director of the 
colorado service station dealers association said three bomb 
threats and two protests have been reported at exxon service 
stations since last weekend 
he said the association is trying to make the public aware of 
the difference between independently owned stations and company 
owned stations 
independent dealers he said are as innocent as the otters in 
alaska 
nonetheless many station operators from maine to california 
said it was business as usual in the wake of the spill others 
attributed any decline in sales to a recent increase in prices at 
the pump 
richard brown manager of an exxon station in suburban new 
orleans said some customers have threatened to stop buying gas in 
protest but said there has been no decrease in business 
for its part exxon responded to two consumer groups boycott 
call earlier this week with a statement issued from its new york 
headquarters reiterating its regret about the spill 
all of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that 
our effort in alaska will convince them that we continue to be a 
responsible company and one people like to do business with 
exxon said

critics have complained the show focuses on sex rather than

the government reported friday that business 
inventories rose 05 percent in february while sales fell 09 
percent a combination that analysts said could point toward 
production cutbacks if it continues 
inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 7636 billion in february following a 08 percent 
increase in january the commerce department reported 
sales meanwhile dropped to a seasonally adjusted 5073 
billion in february after rising 11 percent in the previous month 
the decline was the first since sales fell 02 percent in november 
1987 the month after the stock market crash and marked the 
steepest drop in more than two years 
februarys report was consistent with a host of other 
indications that economic growth is slowing as the record peacetime 
expansion extends into its seventh year 
if increases in inventories are not accompanied by rising sales 
analysts say the result could be production cutbacks that hold down 
economic growth 
robert g dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said the inventory buildup isnt alarming yet but 
unless we can get some sales they are quickly going to be at a 
disturbing level 
the accumulation rate really has been heavy enough that we 
could develop excesses rather quickly if sales did soften 
dederick said i view this as a danger area 
februarys business activity produced an increase in the ratio 
of inventories to sales to 151 to 1 meaning it would take 151 
months to exhaust inventories at februarys sales pace the ratio 
had been 148 to 1 in january 
februarys increase in inventories was led by a 08 percent rise 
in stocks held by retailers followed by a 05 percent gain in 
manufacturer inventories and a 02 percent gain at the wholesale 
level 
in the retail category stockpiles of unsold cars were up 04 
percent as sales declined 24 percent auto sales have been weak 
this year and carmakers are offering new incentive programs in 
hopes of luring more people to dealerships 
februarys decline in business sales included a 17 percent drop 
in manufacturer sales a 06 percent drop in retail sales and a 
virtually unchanged level of sales activity for wholesalers 
analysts have blamed februarys poor sales figures on harsh 
weather that followed a warmweather surge in january marchs 
advance report on retail sales showed purchases edged up 01 
percent

the us merchandise trade deficit widened 
sharply in february the government said friday bolstering 
economists belief that improvement in the nations trade 
performance is fizzling 
the commerce department said the monthly seasonally adjusted 
deficit swelled 209 percent to 105 billion up from a revised 
868 billion in january the deterioration reflected a 53 percent 
increase in imports which swamped a slight 06 percent improvement 
in sales of us goods abroad 
the trade gap for the first two months of the year is running at 
an annual rate of 115 billion scarcely below the 11976 billion 
deficit for all 1988 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said i continue to be 
encouraged that the annual deficit will show further improvement in 
1989 but most private economists disagree 
the rise in oil prices to the 20abarrel level will inflate 
imports while the strength of the dollar will make the price of 
american goods more expensive discouraging export sales they say 
trade fizzled some time ago and this fits in with the theme 
that were still on an unacceptably high plateau said robert 
dederick chief economist at northern trust co in chicago 
the good news is that after worsening in the fourth quarter 
the trade deficit seems to have narrowed a bit but the bad news is 
that still leaves us no better off than last spring he said 
a dramatic 21 percent decline in the trade gap last year from a 
peak of 1521 billion in 1987 accounted for nearly half of 
overall economic growth as measured by the gross national product 
the bush administration is counting on further trade improvement to 
bolster the economy and help it meet its pledges to reduce the 
federal budget deficit without new taxes 
the february performance reflected a 53 percent jump in 
imports which rose to a seasonally adjusted 394 billion the 
higher figure included increases of 10 billion in sales of 
foreign capital goods to businesses and 800 million in purchases 
of foreign cars 
its clear that major improvement in trade continues to be 
held captive by our addiction to imports said economist jerry 
jasinowski of the national association of manufacturers the us 
continues to suck in industrial materials parts and 
equipment 
us oil imports managed to decline 72 percent in february to 
324 billion despite the third consecutive increase in the price 
of a barrel of oil 1508 up from 1446 a month earlier 
we know that has to go up because oil prices are now about 20 
a barrel thats going to add 1 billion a month to the deficit 
said economist michael k evans who owns a washington consulting 
firm were going to have a lot more increases in the trade 
deficit its going to go to 12 billion a month pretty soon and 
its going to stay there 
us exports were up a lackluster 06 percent as drops in 
agricultural and manufactured products nearly offset gains in sales 
of industrial products and autos 
as usual the united states posted its largest trade deficit 
with japan in february 465 billion up 317 percent from a 
threeyear low of 353 billion a month earlier 
the deficit with western europe was 624 million a 
deterioration from januarys rare 46 million surplus 
willard a workman director of international policy for the 
us chamber of commerce said the february report indicates that 
the drop in the deficit with japan in january was only a blip on 
the trade radar scope 
the stall in trade fits in with other evidence of slower growth 
in reports released friday including two consecutive flat months 
of industrial production in february and march a moderation in 
wholesale price inflation and the sharpest drop in business sales 
in february in more than two years

prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
friday he rejects trading land for middle east peace despite an 
earlier government statement that israel is willing to discuss any 
option with the palestinians 
i dont accept it it is not necessary it is not relevant 
he told a news conference on his return to israel from a 10day 
visit to the united states 
shamir 73 described his visit as a success and added there 
is an understanding between the us and israel about our 
fourpoint peace initiative 
shamir met last week with president bush who supported shamirs 
idea for elections in the occupied territories but said the united 
states could not accept permanent israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip which israel seized in the 1967 middle east 
war 
earlier friday israeli sources confirmed a jerusalem post 
report that a cable with shamirs proposal was sent to israeli 
embassies abroad 
shamirs plan offers elections to choose representatives from 
the occupied territories to negotiate an interim settlement with 
israel 
in later negotiations on a final status for the territorities 
israel will be prepared to discuss any option which will be 
presented a source quoted the cable as saying the source spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the government statement appeared to leave open the possibility 
that israel would be willing to consider plo demands for a 
palestinian state despite israels stated opposition to such 
proposals 
several west bank palestinians have offered a counterproposal 
that says residents should elect members of the plos palestine 
national council instead of representatives for talks with israel 
israel radio and palestinian sources said 
at a later stage three of those elected would be nominated to 
negotiate a twoyear interim agreement with israel according to 
the reports 
palestinians see shamirs plan as an attempt to bypass the 
plo said palestinian journalist daoud kuttab but we are ready 
to consider elections to the council this would neutralize the 
problem we have with shamirs idea 
the palestinian plan also calls for partial israeli army 
withdrawal before elections are held under international 
supervision 
in the last stage the plo and israel would negotiate the final 
status of the occupied lands in the framework of an international 
peace conference 
shamir has rejected international supervision of elections 
talks with the plo and an international conference 
shamirs peace plan essentially repeats the 1978 ussponsored 
camp david accords which led to peace with egypt but have been 
rejected by the palestinians because they promise only limited 
selfrule but it adds the elections for palestinian negotiating 
representatives 
like the camp david accords the new plan would leave 
negotiations on the final status of the territories until the third 
year of a fiveyear period of autonomy 
the territories are home to 17 million palestinians

a convoy bringing food and fuel to 
kabul broke through a guerrilla blockade friday with afghan 
soldiers and helicopter gunships providing cover as the trucks 
rolled down the salang highway 
the government said another major highway was reopened friday 
allowing trucks to carry supplies to jalalabad which has been 
under rebel fire for more than five weeks 
fighting continued on the salang highway for nearly two hours 
and thick black smoke billowed from the mountains a few miles 
away the highway a vital supply route leading into the deprived 
capital was closed a week ago by moslem guerrillas who are hoping 
to starve the city into surrender 
the convoy comprised up to 100 vehicles as it moved slowly down 
the highway soldiers fired from tanks and machine gun posts into 
the surrounding mountains where the guerrillas are hiding 
several trucks appeared to have been damaged and one was 
carrying several wounded men diplomats who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said about 600 trucks were still stranded along the 
salang 
another convoy moved out of the capital and down the highway 
linking kabul and jalalabad a provincial capital about 70 miles 
away 
the government said the convoy took supplies to government 
soldiers who had been depending on air drops the road which also 
is used to ferry supplies to kabul was closed to routine traffic 
almost two weeks ago 
the guerrillas say they control about 20 miles of the highway 
the major route to the border with pakistan 
the guerrillas have made blockades a primary tactic in their 
fight to overthrow the marxist government which seized power in an 
april 1978 coup 
the soviet union has been flying food and military equipment to 
kabul supplies also are being flown to jalalabad and khost said 
one senior soviet source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the source indicated moscow would send the afghan government any 
arms it needed to hold jalalabad 
they can have the hardware at our disposal in any numbers they 
want the official said jalalabad must be held it will be 
held 
the source said about 2000 government troops had died since the 
guerrillas began bombarding the city he said 8000 rebels had been 
killed in retaliatory strikes 
if jalalabad falls it would be the largest city captured by the 
rebels and would give them a base to set up an interim government 
the afghan armed forces are equipped with sophisticated weapons 
from the soviet union including longrange scudb missiles 
soviet officials have denied moscow has sent any new arms to 
afghanistan since the red army pullout was completed feb 15 a 
un accord that mandated the withdrawal prohibits outside 
interference but the various signatories have accused each other 
of violating that provision 
at the united nations afghan foreign minister abdul wakil said 
us industrialist armand hammer has offered to act as a gobetween 
to foster peace in afghanistan 
wakil who addressed the security council this week said 
hammer chairman of occidential petroleum invited him to los 
angeles in the next few days to discuss peace prospects but he 
said the state department prohibited the meeting 
we received his invitation and communicated it to the state 
department to get a travel permit however this was denied 
wakil said it was quite strange to see in this advanced and very 
civilized nation where americans speak of democracy and free 
movement that such rights are denied 
the us government routinely restricts the travel of officials 
of communist countries and those with which the united states has 
no diplomatic relations 
hammer known for his efforts to establish ties between the 
united states and the soviet union has visited afghanistan several 
times in the past two years

a pentagon research official said friday that 
the us defense industrial base is being hurt by american 
companies increasing shift of research and development activities 
overseas 
im very concerned about the movement of research and 
development offshore said craig i fields deputy director for 
research of the defense advanced research projects agency 
fields said that while companies may have made the right 
business decision in the short run such a trend is likely to 
have an adverse impact on this countrys longterm military and 
economic capabilities 
he also expressed concern about the increasing dependency of 
the defense department on foreign components and technologies 
darpa has sought to bolster us capabilities by channeling 
research funds into key technologies including advanced 
semiconductors supercomputers and socalled artificial 
intelligence with both military and civilian applications 
fields speaking at a conference sponsored by the american 
association for the advancement of science said much more needs to 
be done to coordinate us longerterm defense research aims with 
programs of civilian agencies such as the commerce department 
it has to be a governmentwide posture not a defense posture 
alone he said 
jacques gansler a former pentagon official called for the 
formulation of an overall defense industrial technology 
strategy to guide military research and development efforts 
currently us weapons are being designed so that they are 
incredibly expensive and so complex that they wont work said 
gansler senior vice president of analytic sciences corp a 
research company in suburban arlington va 
he said that with greater emphasis on manufacturing process 
technology the nations defense industries should be able to 
achieve higher quality production at lower cost 
also speaking at the conference was john pike associate 
director for space policy of the federation of american scientists 
a washingtonbased public interest group 
pike a longtime critic of the star wars missile defense 
effort said that the program formally called the strategic 
defense initiative now appears to be firmly entrenched and on the 
verge of demonstrating real technological results 
with the scalingdown of star wars goals from a complete nuclear 
shield to defense of selected us military targets pike said 
at least were dealing with a system whose cost and performance 
goals are not obviously absurd 
reagan announced the research effort in a televised speech in 
march 1983 for the current fiscal year 41 billion is provided 
for sdi reagans last budget requested an increase to 59 billion 
for the 1990 fiscal year 
beginning this year we are going to start seeing real tests of 
real hardware including highpowered lasers pike said

about 60 miles south of valdez ed 
morris walks a sad beat on beautiful but hauntingly empty green 
island 
morris is a regular visitor to this and other oilstained 
islands in prince william sound his job is to collect dead animals 
and birds and occasionally a halfdead sea gull or otter so mired 
in oily goo that it cant float or fly 
since he began the job eight days ago hes recovered 100 dead 
creatures 12 maybe 15 live ones that is a small fraction of the 
thousands that have died or been contaminated since the exxon 
valdez went aground three weeks ago spewing 101 million gallons 
of oil into sounds bountiful marine habitat 
morris rides to the unpopulated islands in an orange zodiak 
rubber boat watching both the edge and top of the shoreline 
the dead ones are usually up here in the oily grass he 
says pointing to the hightide mark of greasy seaweed they just 
roll up there with the tide 
the living ones are down by the waters edge they stay there 
in case they feel threatened so they can try to get away in the 
water he says 
if they swim away it will mean death their fur and feathers 
are coated with oil they can no longer float or keep their body 
warmth 
animals still living are flown to valdez where they are cleaned 
and rehabilitated the dead ones are collected by a shuttle 
boat 
its all pretty sickening says morris a cordova resident 
who normally fishes for salmon in the adjacent oilfouled waters of 
knight island 
morris was wintering in california when he heard about the 
spill he hurried home i wanted to take care of whatever had to 
be taken care of he says 
so morris was hired by veco a subcontractor of exxon helping to 
conduct the cleanup he is one of the hundreds signed on during the 
employment boom created by the spill 
the money at a base wage of 1669 an hour is good and it is 
steady jobs are likely to last a long time in the aftermath of the 
spill morris is doing his part but he doesnt like what he sees 
on the quiet shorelines 
i dont enjoy it but somebodys got to do it i guess he

army gunfire friday wounded more than 20 
palestinians in the occupied lands including a 3yearold girl 
during protests of the bloody raid by border police in the village 
of nahalin arab hospital officials said 
the army said a 14yearpalestinian died of a bullet wound in 
the head sustained last week during clashes with troops in the west 
bank town of jenin an army spokeswoman said 
in jerusalem police barred residents of the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip from entering the al aqsa mosque islams third 
holiest site 
the army launched an investigation friday into the raid before 
dawn thursday at nahalin in which at least five palestinians were 
killed the national itim news agency reported it said two 
brigidier generals were leading the inquiry 
in geneva the red cross said six arabs were killed in the west 
bank village near bethlehem and accused israeli paramilitary border 
police of firing without discrimination and without restraint 
the clash was one of the bloodiest in the 16month palestinian 
uprising during which 430 palestinians and 18 israelis have been 
killed 
maj gen meshulam amit commander of the border police told 
the associated press the dimensions of the killings underscore 
the need to thoroughly examine the incident 
if there were irregularities or mistakes made by the border 
policemen the appropriate action will be taken he said 
the border police have recently been given the prime role in 
searchandarrest raids and riot control with the army working as 
backup the army commands border police in the occupied territories 
at least 11 refugee camps towns or villages in the west bank 
and occupied gaza strip had demonstrations or were shut down by 
general strikes called to protest the slayings

a century after onetenth of the united 
states army converged on a parcel of land in indian territory to 
oversee the regions first great land run the blue coats are 
returning to fort reno 
about 500 reenactors including 150 military hobbyists from 
five states will take part in a weekend encampment organizers 
hope will authentically reproduce the excitement of the days before 
the run of 89 in which settlers stampeded the area to claim land 
that was free for the taking 
the goal is to give a good history lesson said deborah 
foreman who with her husband gary helped organize fort reno and 
indian territory days 
participants representing cavalry and infantry units of the 
period are coming from illinois arkansas louisiana and texas as 
well as oklahoma mrs foreman said 
spectators at the fort reno parade grounds saturday and sunday 
will see cavalry competition infantry drills indian dancing a 
wagon demonstration a frontier fashion show period music and 
simulated gunfights she said 
about 120 indians will show how their ancestors lived before the 
land run and will participate in ceremonies during the 
reenactment mrs foreman said 
she said organizers were careful to consider the feelings of 
tribal officials who see no reason to celebrate the centennial of 
another episode in which the government took away indian land 
this event is a living history demonstration this is not a 
land run celebration mrs foreman said 
the events at the historic fort west of el reno constitute the 
largest authentic reenactment in the state it is a prelude to 
events in guthrie where the centennial of the land rush will be 
observed the following weekend 
a century ago thousands of settlers gathered in camps around 
the unassigned lands in the days before the run collecting 
supplies and girding for a mad dash for land 
about 2500 soldiers were stationed in and around the 2 million 
acres of the unassigned lands in what is now central oklahoma 
their job was to help federal marshals keep the peace and to keep 
out the sooners who tried to sneak in early 
most of the trouble encountered was evicting squatters 
rounding up cattle rustlers timber thieves hunters and notifying 
ranch owners to vacate their cattle prior to april 20 sgt john 
brandt trumpeter of troop l 5th cavalry wrote 
at noon on april 22 1889 the boom of cannon from fort reno and 
gunshots and bugles elsewhere signaled the beginning of the run for 
more than 40000 settlers 
there were sounds of a mighty roar and cheer whips cracking 
and men shouting to their horses said brandt who was stationed 
near purcell one of eight major starting points for the run 
the saddle horses plunged and raced by at top speed the 
lighter vehicles and faster horses stretched out towards the river 
then the slower horses and heavier wagons thundered by 
while there were more than a dozen other land openings through 
lotteries and runs before statehood in 1907 historians say it was 
the first land run that started the inevitable movement toward 
statehood

the state department on friday praised 
congressional approval of new aid for the contra rebels and warned 
the nicaraguan government that the deadline for fulfilling its 
commitment to political reforms was only 11 days away 
the state departments statement appears designed to use the 
leverage it was granted by congress to prod the sovietbacked 
nicaraguan government into giving the contras a share in the 
political process 
vice president dan quayle meantime told the american society 
of newspaper editors convention he hopes the american press will 
watch nicaraguan president daniel ortega closely to see if he keeps 
his commitments to democratic reforms 
are the sandinistas finally willing to take the course that 
all the central american governments committed themselves to 
are they prepared to negotiate with the internal opposition and the 
nicaraguan resistance in order to promote national reconciliation 
among all nicaraguans he asked we will know the answers to 
these questions and we will know them relatively soon 
congress on thursday approved a 497 million package of food 
and medical aid for the contras to last them for 10 months until 
they can return to their homes in nicaragua and be assured 
participation in a democratic political system 
the compromise package was worked out by secretary of state 
james a baker iii to avoid the kind of divisiveness with the 
democraticcontrolled congress which derailed past administration 
attempts to aid the contras 
we welcome passage of the legislation said spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler approval of this assistance is a tangible 
manifestation of bipartisanship 
at the same time the sandinista government must now comply with 
an agreement by the central american countries which calls for 
nicaragua to create the conditions which will allow for the 
reintegration of the resistance into a safe democratic 
nicaragua she said 
we are deeply concerned by the refusal thus far by the 
sandinistas to negotiate with the internal opposition on the reform 
of electoral laws ms tutwiler said 
on thursday the ruling sandinista party condemned the contra 
aid package saying it threatens the nicaraguan government and 
makes fun of the will of the central american presidents 
the presidents of el salvador honduras guatemala and costa 
rica signed a pact on feb 14 in el salvador agreeing to draft a 
plan by midmay to dismantle the contras most of whom are in 
jungle camps in honduras near the nicaraguan border 
in the pact ortega promised legal reforms to guarantee fair 
general elections which he moved up by 10 months to feb 25 
1990 the first stage of the reforms is supposed to be in place by 
april 25 
only 11 days remain before the deadline established at the 
el salvador meeting the state department said in a statement 
we hope the government of nicaragua will engage in a genuine 
dialogue to achieve a national consensus on necessary reforms 
the statement said 
it is increasingly clear that the sandinistas conduct must be 
closely scrutinized by all who care about the future of democracy 
in nicaragua it said 
such scrutiny was one of the main motives cited by supporters of 
the compromise contra aid package in congress who hope it will put 
the sandinista leadership under intense international pressure to 
keep its promises

government and military 
thursdays blast came on the second day of a oneweek truce 
offered by president ranasinghe premadasa to sinhalese and tamil

ivana markovics high school record is good 
enough for her to be accepted by five topnotch universities but 
not good enough for the state board of education to give her a 
diploma 
the board says she finished her high school work too quickly 
miss markovic 16 will enroll this fall at the massachusetts 
institute of technology turning down vanderbilt duke emory and 
georgia tech 
but shell do so without her parkview high school diploma 
thanks to a 72 vote this week by the state school board which 
refused to bend its rule requiring all high school credits to be 
earned in high school 
miss markovic a yugoslavian native who speaks three languages 
took two of her high school courses in middle school so they dont 
count even though she made as in both 
the funny thing is that i have all the academic courses 
required for high school graduation said miss markovic i need 
just two electives to earn my diploma 
i understand she is a brilliant student but she simply 
doesnt have enough credits to earn a high school diploma said 
board member hollis q lathem 
larry a foster sr another board member said the boards 
philosophy is that students miss markovics age are better off in 
high school 
miss markovics father milan said the ruling illustrates how 
georgia fails its gifted students 
they have options for students who failed that allow these 
students to go to summer school or take class at night so they can 
graduate on time he said but they dont have any policy in 
place to help students who are motivated and complete the 
requirements ahead of time 
markovic said he might appeal the decision to the state supreme 
court he has a daughter in the eighth grade who could face the 
same dilemma in a few years 
meanwhile mit has said it would admit miss markovic without her 
parkview diploma 
all my plans are just as they were before the boards 
ruling said miss markovic who wants to be a genetic researcher 
i know i can handle college i know what i can do

doctor instead he became the wisecracking founder of the radical 
yippie movement horrifying his father as he ducked underground in 
skirmishes with the establishment 
having abbie hoffman as a son could be difficult but it was a 
relationship spiced with adventure and an indomitable humor his 
mother recalled friday 
he had a wonderful sense of humor he loved every funny book 
he could put his hands on she said 
i never thought he was going to become famous i never had 
that in mind mrs hoffman 83 said in a telephone interview 
from her home in worcester 
hoffman 52 was found dead wednesday in his bed at his 
apartment in new hope pa 
an autopsy on hoffman was inconclusive and officials said they 
would not know the results of toxicology tests until next week at 
the earliest 
mrs hoffman said her son had been troubled but she didnt 
believe he had killed himself 
my son knew that he had problems mrs hoffman said they 
found no drugs around him i think suicide may be ruled out 
a memorial service was planned for wednesday at temple emanuel 
in worcester the synagogue hoffman attended as a child 
hoffman became famous with the chicago seven a group of 
radicals who stood trial on charges of conspiring to disrupt the 
1968 democratic national convention in chicago he was acquitted of 
conspiracy and a conviction of crossing state lines with intent to 
riot was overturned

international party in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest 
the government and the vietnam war

mrs hoffman said 
my husband took it really hard she said when he was 
underground my husband just couldnt take the news when this 
happened he died while his son was in hiding to avoid trial on 
cocaine charges 
of course everyone has ambitions i wanted him to be a good 
student and be able to make it in life maybe i was over ambitious 
maybe we both were mrs hoffman said 
the hoffmans drove abbie to brandeis university for an interview 
at the medical school but instructors advised that he was better 
at mathematics than medicine at brandeis hoffmans interests 
turned to psychology 
mrs hoffman credited brandeis a cradle of 1960s activism with 
hoffmans emergence as a radical leader 
hoffman never followed the conventional path his parents had 
envisioned but mrs hoffman said she was always sure of his 
affection 
yes he did love me and i loved him too she said but what 
can you do things happen in your life

un officials and namibias south 
africanappointed administrator extended to april 21 the deadline 
for 900 black nationalist guerrillas to withdraw to angola to 
salvage an independence plan 
a prolonged stalemate in the affected areas is in no ones 
interest said a joint statement 
also on friday territorial officials said 13 guerrillas have 
been killed in battles with security forces 
it was the first official report of fighting between south 
africanled security forces and guerrillas of the southwest africa 
peoples organization since last weekend when the two sides agreed 
swapo fighters would safely withdraw from namibia 
gerhard roux spokesman for administrator louis pienaar said 
security forces also found the bodies of another six insurgents in 
the bush of northern namibia this week but he said it is not known 
when they died 
paramilitary police and soldiers killed five guerrillas in a 
thursday confrontation and two on tuesday roux told reporters 
fighting erupted april 1 the first day of a ceasefire starting 
a yearlong un process to make namibia independent since then 
territorial officials say 276 guerrillas and 27 security force 
members have been killed swapo says its losses are much lower and 
charges onefifth of those killed were civilians 
south african foreign minister pik botha said friday that 1600 
guerrillas have infiltrated into northern namibia from angola since 
april 1 and must be accounted for before the independence process 
can move ahead 
of those about 350 have withdrawn from namibia 22 have been 
captured and about 900 remain in the territory botha said 
no explanation was given for his new estimate of 1600 
infiltrators down from 1900 
the incursion has jeopardized plans to hold independence 
elections in november botha has said 
last weekend south african cuban and angolan officials 
negotiated safe passage back to angola for guerrillas who report to 
unmonitored checkpoints 
the previous deadline for the guerrilla withdrawal was saturday 
as of friday evening however only five guerrillas had 
reported others who withdrew apparently did so on their own 
un official cedric thornberry said thursday the insurgents 
probably are reluctant to surface because of the menacing 
presence of security forces near un assembly points 
the ceasefire has not been reinstated since last weeks 
fighting the fiercest in the 23year war although south africa 
says its forces will fire at guerrillas only if attacked 
botha also agreed with the united nations that south african 
soldiers not be allowed to interrogate guerrillas who report to the 
checkpoints some south african soldiers tried to get access to 
four guerrillas at a checkpoint thursday but australian and 
british members of the un monitoring force rebuffed them 
un investigators have supported south africas contention that 
the guerrillas violated an accord requiring they stay at angolan 
bases at least until may 15 when they could enter namibia as 
unarmed refugees 
exiled swapo president sam nujoma has called on his fighters to 
withdraw but has not told them to report to the checkpoints 
south africa has ruled this mineralrich territory since it 
captured it from germany in world war i in december it agreed to 
begin a transition to independence in exchange for cuba withdrawing 
50000 troops from angola 
swapo has fought south african rule since 1966 and is favored to 
get the most votes in independence elections but it is uncertain 
whether it will get the twothirds support needed to win full 
control of a new government

a soviet nuclearpowered submarine was testing 
deep sea dives and conducting scientific experiments when it caught 
fire and sank off norway tass said friday 
the official news agency said investigators have come up with 
four probable causes of april 7 disaster which killed 42 of the 69 
sailors aboard but it did not list them it also said a decision 
on whether to salvage the submarine could take months 
in oslo norwegian experts said the subs nuclear reactors and 
weapons are apparently intact in the vessel on the ocean floor 
eight water samples collected near the sunken vessel 5000 feet 
beneath the ocean surface detected no radiation leakage said 
norways national institute of radiation protection 
tass said the submarine was an experimental vessel that was 
testing deep dives and unusual materials when the accident happened 
the test program covered a total of 12 scientific and 
technological problems and even in the short time during which the 
submarine was put through its paces it produced exceptional 
research results it said without elaboration 
the soviet nuclearpowered vessel is thought to be one of that 
countrys most advanced submarines 
a decision on whether to attempt to raise the submarine will not 
be made for several months tass said quoting deputy prime 
minister igor belovsov 
several officials at a news conference thursday for soviet 
journalists blamed the severity of the fire on the flow of 
highpressure air into the burning compartment tass said but the 
cause of the fire is unknown 
experts have identified four most probable causes of the subs 
loss but wont yet make the final conclusion tass said it 
quoted belovsov as saying the government commission investigating 
the accident agreed on the need to develop new sea rescue 
techniques and lifesaving equipment 
the norweigan institute said the vessel apparently withstood 
tremendous water pressure and explosions that sank the ship 
the soviets have said the submarines two reactors were shut 
down before the crew evacuated and that neither of the two 
nucleartipped torpedoes was armed for combat they said there was 
no danger of radioactivity being released from the sunken vessel 
but the institute said it may collect more water samples 
deepwater currents may have prevented accurate detection of 
radioactivity said johan baarli director of the government 
institute 
earlier tests taken near the sub 310 miles off norways 
northern coast showed no atmospheric contamination from the 
sinking

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
friday that mikhail s gorbachevs critics may try to stifle his 
economic reform program unless he succeeds in getting consumer 
goods on the table and in the markets 
baker said that the political reforms gorbachev has pushed as 
part of perestroika or resturcturing are progressing faster 
than his economic reforms 
that might trigger something he said these things 
generally have to proceed apace 
addressing the american society of newspaper editors the 
secretary commented 
if they are unable to get the economic part of this going and 
going well so there are consumer goods on the table and in the 
markets thats going to give rise i suppose to some feelings on 
the part of some that this idea of perestroika doesnt mean much to 
the common man or woman in the soviet union 
baker said gorbachevs program entails risks to him from 
opponents of change entrenched elements of the soviet bureaucracy 
and sources of nationalistic discontent 
the secretary who will meet with gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze next month in moscow said that a 
reversal of perestroika would be unfortunate 
unless the west adopts an obstructionist approach to the 
soviet union he said its our view that whether or not 
perestroika succeeds will depend on what happens in the soviet 
union and not on what we in the west might do or might not do 
answering a subsequent question baker said 
we very much want perestroika to succeed and we very much want 
the general secretary to succeed we think thats in the best 
interest of the united states and the best interest of the world 
 
just this week a moscow newspaper said sugar rationing would 
begin in the soviet capital for the first time since world war ii 
and the daily socialist industry said earlier this month that 
many soviet citizens can expect that the year 1989 will be the 
most unsuccessful of all those we have lived through the bony 
hand of hunger for products is quite capable of strangling 
perestroika 
addressing the editors baker mixed praise of gorbachev and 
perestroika with a complaint that there remain too many areas 
where the slogans of new thinking lack content 
for instance baker said he intended to confront the soviet 
leaders with their recent sale of highperformance bombers to libya 
repeating us charges that the north african country supports 
terrorism baker asked how does this sale assist in the 
worldwide efforts supposedly supported by moscow to control 
chemical weapons that libya is developing at its rabta plant 
he also renewed us demands that the berlin wall be torn down 
and that the soviets repudiate the brezhnev doctrine which asserts 
a right to intervene in east european countries

three bombs exploded friday in 
the master bedroom and dining room of vice presidentelect 
francisco merinos home slightly injuring a child and causing 
extensive damage police said 
merino and his wife maria antonieta were visiting the united 
states but the couples four young children and three friends were 
sleeping in the house in affluent maquilishuat suburb when it was 
bombed at dawn the injured child who was cut by a piece of 
debris was a friend of merinos children 
seven or eight men raced up in two cars lobbed 2pound blocks 
of tnt over a wall surrounding the garden and sped away a 
policeman quoted witnesses as saying three bombs exploded and the 
other was deactivated later he said on condition of anonymity 
presidentelect alfredo cristiani blamed the leftist farabundo 
marti national liberation front when he visited the house afer the 
attack an anonymous caller told a radio station the rebels were 
not responsible 
the caller said they had nothing to do with the attack even 
though merino is one of those who is promoting terror repression 
and slaughter of our people and we consider that he deserves this 
and much more 
the marxistled insurgents have fought nine years against the 
usbacked government 
cristiani said the bombing demonstrates that they are savages 
who are not interested in peace but only interested in terrorizing 
the civilian population i think very little can be achieved as 
far as pacifying the country through dialogue with these kind of 
people 
cristiani and merino of the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance were elected march 19 they take office june 1 from 
christian democratic president jose napoleon duarte

after 48 witnesses and nearly 11 weeks 
testimony ended in the oliver north trial friday with a witness 
describing a pretty frantic north so strapped for cash in 1984 
that he complained of not having enough for lunch or gasoline 
but said mary dix who controlled expense money at the national 
security council all that stopped in 1985 a time when north had 
in his office safe a huge revolving fund for expenses having to do 
with the nicaraguan contras 
after hearing her and four other rebuttal witnesses the judge 
sent jurors home for a long weekend and told them to return tuesday 
for final arguments expected to take most of two days he said they 
would be sequestered as soon as they begin deliberations 
mrs dix said north in 1984 was after her to reimburse him for 
taxi fares and other expenses quickly 
he would run by and his face was red and he was very upset 
with my staff if for some reason they didnt have money she 
said he would say he didnt have enough cash to go home or he 
didnt have lunch money he was pretty frantic that we turn them 
the expense accounts around as fast as we could because his 
credit cards were charged to the max 
once she said he ran after her in a hallway yelling mary 
mary 
her description of north then earning 50000 as a marine 
lieutenant colonel was at odds with norths own testimony he said 
that since he was a midshipman at the us naval academy he had a 
family fund of as much as 15000 stashed in a metal box bolted to 
the floor in a closet at home 
north is charged with profiting illegally from his irancontra 
dealings including an accusation that he diverted contra 
travelers checks to his own use he is also accused of lying to 
congress and the attorney general about his activities 
the jury which had heard a succession of witnesses who included 
a congressman an attorney general a national security adviser a 
contra leader and a number of cia agents in an eightweek period 
also heard friday from a used car salesman 
william howell also contradicted a north account in this case 
in connection with how north came to buy a used car in october 1985 
for 8038 for cash north said he went to the lot in tysons 
corner va to buy a station wagon then saw a heavier vehicle and 
settled on that paying 5000 down and the balance four days 
later all in cash from the box 
howell recalled however that north telephoned him three times 
responding to a newspaper ad for the car a 1982 chevrolet 
suburban a heavyduty vehicle with 51000 miles 
he inquired about the vehicle indicating he had a necessity 
to tow a horse trailer howell said the oldest daughter of 
norths four children rode horses in competitions 
to a question by assistant prosecutor david zornow about what 
north said about paying the balance howell said it was my 
understanding the money was to come from the white house credit 
union 
howell said north later gave him his wife daughter and parents 
a tour of the white house when it was decorated for christmas 
willard zucker who previously testified was brought back for 
further questioning friday he is an american living in switzerland 
who set up bank accounts for albert hakim a business partner of 
norths codefendant richard secord zucker said he was asked by 
hakim to sound norths wife out about helping his children with 
their education 
north had explained that hakim had wanted to provide for his 
family if something happened to him on his dangerous clandestine 
mission to tehran in 1986 and had told him only that mrs north was 
to meet hakims lawyer 
i said to her i have been requested by some of our clients i 
didnt identify them to obtain certain information from her about 
her children for the purpose of seeing whether there was some 
possibility of being some assistance with respect to their 
education zucker testified 
also testifying friday was stephen e berry associate counsel 
in 1986 of the house intelligence committee he said north had told 
a meeting of the committee in august that year that he had 
installed a security system at his home at his own expense 
one of the charges against north is that he accepted an illegal 
gratuity the 13800 system which was paid for by secord and 
then tried to hide that fact by backdating two letters to the 
contractor

just as george bush refused to discuss his 
private chats with president reagan vice president dan quayle 
wouldnt say friday what he and bush talk about in the white house 
inner sanctum 
but during a questionandanswer session with members of the 
audience at the american society of newspaper editors convention 
quayle did provide some insights into how bush conducts himself 
during these highlevel meetings 
he enjoys the give and take quayle said he enjoys having 
ideas put forward whether it be by me or by others he enjoys the 
competition of ideas and discussion of policy and where we ought to 
be going 
quayle however declined to respond when asked to cite what 
differences he may have had with the president in the nearly three 
months theyve been in office 
im not going to get into private conversations that i have 
with the president and what kind of influence and how i think i can 
influence his decisions quayle said it wouldnt be 
appropriate ive decided not to do it and if i did engage and 
do it i would lose my effectiveness 
when he was campaigning for the presidency bush steadfastly 
refused in debate and in exchanges with reporters to discuss 
whatever he might have said to reagan or what reagan might have 
said to him 
this question arose frequently in the context of what bush knew 
about the irancontra scandal and what role he might have played in 
it 
quayle also said friday hes pleased with the access he has to 
the president 
i have the right to go into his office anytime he said 
adding that he has had several oneonone meetings with bush in 
addition to their regular thursday lunches 
asked to compare his vice presidential style with that of bush 
quayle told the audience that from the operational point of view 
it is essentially the same type of vice presidency 
now obviously im a different individual than president 
bush and obviously in a period of time you will have a quayle 
model of the vice presidency he said were just starting 
i would say from a philosophical and an ideological point of 
view that there is from a practical point of view no difference 
at all he said but quayle also said obviously in style in 
rhetoric things of that sort we will approach the job in a 
different manner

the state department spokeswoman said friday 
that the united states still views jewish settlements in the west 
bank and gaza as impediments to peace and urged palestinians and 
israelis to refrain from exacerbating their tensions 
the comments by department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
followed thursdays clash in the occupied west bank village of 
nahalin in which israeli forces shot and killed at least five 
palestinians in one of the bloodiest incidents of the 16month 
palestinian uprising 
an estimated 80000 jews live in settlements among an estimated 
17 million palestinians but settlement construction has been 
scaled back in recent years by budgetary and political constraints 
under an agreement reached by partners in israels coalition 
government last year the first of eight new settlements went up 
last week in the west bank not far from the village 
in response to reports that the united states had changed its 
policy on jewish settlements ms tutwiler said there is no 
change in our policy our policy remains what it has been 
we continue to believe that new settlements do not contribute 
to a climate that can promote the peace process she said 
ms tutwiler said the loss of life and injuries which occurred 
yesterday is tragic we urge all sides to refrain from engaging 
in confrontations that lead to the unnecessary loss of life 
the united states she said wants to see the violence stopped 
and see steps taken that can begin to defuse the tension on the 
ground 
secretary of state james a baker iii passed a similar message 
to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir during shamirs recent 
visit shamir proposed holding elections among the palestinians as 
one tensionreducing step 
but the palestine liberation organization has rejected any 
slowing of the palestinian uprising until israel withdraws from the 
lands it captured in the 1967 war 
meantime the state department registered opposition to any 
effort to grant the plo membership in the united nations 
in our view the selfdeclared palestinian state which we do 
not recognize does not meet the generally accepted international 
law criteria for statehood a department statement said it added 
that the plo does not qualify for membership in un agencies 
the statement responded to a letter by 38 senators urging baker 
to oppose un recognition of the plo as a member state an 
upgrading of its current observer status 
in new york the plos permanent observer zuhdi labib terzi told 
the associated press that his organization was not considering 
applying to the un for membership now that would be 
premature he said 
we have not yet gone to the security council to apply he 
said we are not that stupid when the us holds a veto over 
the councils decisions 
the state department also addressed the latest violence in 
lebanon 
in a departure from previous statements the state department 
named syria as one of the parties being urged to cease fire in 
beirut until now repeated us urgings for calm in lebanon have 
failed to name syria referring to it only as a warring party 
we condemn the savage shelling in beirut on thursday it was a 
reprehensible reminder that 14 years of armed conflict have failed 
to solve lebanons problems said a department statement 
we reprove all participants in yesterdays fighting both 
lebanese and nonlebanese we call on all combatants including the 
lebanese armed forces the different militias and the syrian army 
to cease fire it said 
the statement also called on christian leader gen michel aoun 
to pursue his recent proposal for powersharing talks with 
lebanons moslem majority saying moslem prime minister salim 
alhoss should take aoun up on his offer 
in an apparent reference to aouns stated intention of expelling 
the 40000 syrian troops from lebanon the statement said that 
force will not unite the lebanese neither will it cause foreign 
troops to withdraw

a 16th round of talks on the future of 
us military bases in greece ended friday without making any 
progress a government spokesman said 
the talks on a new defense and economic cooperation agreement 
which began monday stumbled on greeces insistence the united 
states help athens solve differences with neighboring turkey 
spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said 
us negotiators said they dont want regional disputes wound 
into the bilateral talks 
greece and turkey have longstanding quarrels over seabed mineral 
rights military control of the aegean sea and the wardivided 
mediterranean island of cyprus 
another issue clouding the talks is greeces reluctance to 
extradite a suspected palestinian terrorist mohammed rashid 
wanted by the united states for the 1982 bombing of a pan am jumbo 
jet kostopoulos said the blast killed a japanese teenager and 
injured 15 other passengers 
rashid is in athens topsecurity prison awaiting a decision on 
the extradition from greeces supreme court the decision has been 
delayed three times since the 34yearold palestinian was arrested 
at the athens airport 
the united states may cut its military aid to greece if rashid 
is not extradited us diplomats have said 
the fiveyear base agreement expired dec 20 under the accord 
the united states has 17 months to leavrsal from the reagan 
administration raised environmental concerns about the sale of oil 
and gas leases in the three offshore areas off the southern and 
northern california coastlines and off southern florida in the gulf 
of mexico 
in each case environmentalists have vigorously fought oil 
exploration arguing the lease sites are too close to 
environmentally fragile and important ecosystems 
the president directed that the lease sales which were 
scheduled to begin this year and next be put on hold until a 
further environmental impact study by the task force can be 
completed the group plans to report to the president by the end of 
the year 
lujan rejected suggestions by some environmental groups that the 
task force is biased toward oil development environentalists had 
wanted environmental groups fishermen and the florida and 
california state governments represented but were rebuffed 
we think it very well balanced said lujan the task force 
includes representatives from the interior and energy departments 
as well as the environmental protection agency and national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration the national academy of sciences 
serves as a consultant 
lujan said that the alaska spill has made it imperative to take 
a close look at transportation and emergency response issues in 
considering the environmental questions surrounding oil drilling in 
the three lease areas 
robert kallman executive director of the task force said in 
some cases the government might require pipelines to be built 
instead of using supertankers such as the one that ran aground in 
alaska 
kallman said that while the southern california area is most 
suited for transporting oil through pipelines the industry likely 
would want to opt for tanker transportation in the northern 
california and florida fields 
kallman recently resigned as director of the minerals management 
service at the interior department where he was responsible for 
managing the federal offshore oil and gas leasing program he 
described himself friday as a supporter of offshore drilling as 
long as its environmentally possible and feasible 
the three lease areas were to be put up for sale this year or 
early next year until bush called for additional environmental 
studies officials acknowledge that opposition is likely to become 
more intense after the alaska spill 
in the lease area under review off the florida coast oil 
companies already have purchased 73 leases for more than 100 
million but have been prevented from drilling by a moratorium 
imposed by congress the task force study covers only leases that 
have not yet been sold so oil companies would be free to drill on 
the 73 leases they already own when the congressional moratorium 
expires in october 
but lujan said friday he would be strongly opposed to any such 
drilling prior to completion of the task force report he suggested 
that anybody with an ounce of brains would think twice before 
going ahead with drilling before the task force report is completed 
and a decision is made by the president on whether to go ahead with 
selling additional leases

the united states on friday urged india and 
nepal to resolve their differences at the negotiating table and not 
to endanger stability in the volatile region 
we are urging both countries to begin meaningful talks and to 
recognize that a quick and amicable resolution is in their own 
interests and that of regional harmony and stability said a 
statement issued by the state department 
we have no comments on the relative merits of this bilateral 
issue said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler reading the statement 
india on friday accused nepal of violating a 39yearold 
friendship treaty and said it might have to review its relations 
with its tiny landlocked neighbor 
relations between the two countries soured earlier this year 
after nepal bought arms from china which india views as an enemy 
in the latest development india stopped trade with nepal march 19 
after the two countries treaties on trade and transit expired 
what is important is that nepal and india decide what kind of 
relationship these two sovereign and independent countries want 
with one another and to make arrangements to facilitate talks in a 
way which is least disruptive to those concerned the department 
said

a 14nation commission friday wrapped 
up eight years of work on international disarmament suggesting 
expanded un operations against terrorism environmental disaster 
and civil conflict 
the palme commission which included former us secretary of 
state cyrus vance soviet communist party central committee member 
georgi arbatov and norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland 
suggested the united nations establish a peace fund to pay for its 
new duties 
the commission praised disarmament progress since the 
organizations founding in 1980 and said international emphasis was 
shifting from confrontation to cooperation 
up to the nuclear age people thought you have to be strong to 
survive in the best possibility you could beat your enemy said 
egon bahr a member of west germanys parliament 
this is finished said bahr we have not completely 
succeeded but we have gone along the way 
the independent viennabased commission founded by the late 
swedish prime minister olof palme and others in 1982 proposed the 
idea of common security it was one of the early proponents of a 
european zone free of tactical nuclear weapons and a stronger 
united nations 
it decided two years ago to disband but to continue disarmament 
work in smaller groups 
a final statement blamed inadequate funding for hampering un 
operations in namibia and threatening peace in the territory which 
gained independence from south africa on april 1 
it suggested a special 2 billion reserve fund be set up for 
expanded peacekeeping work paid by mandatory contributions from 
all members 
a world that spends the equivalent of nearly 1 trillion each 
year to prepare for war should be able to afford the comparatively 
small sums required for peacekeeping the document said 
it suggested un forces be given roles in 
maritime peacekeeping in situations such as the dangers to 
shipping in the persian gulf stemming from the iraniraq war 
antiterrorist actions david owen a former british foreign 
secretary said storming a hijacked aircraft or diverting a nuclear 
terrorist threat were examples of how such a force could work 
especially in countries too small to have antiterror units of 
their own 
environmental cleanups in countries that do not have the 
expertise to cope with disasters 
prolonged conflicts within a state especially when 
international relief efforts are threatened

secretary of state james a baker iii defended 
on friday a decision to keep presidents fidel castro of cuba and 
daniel ortega of nicaragua from speaking to the american society of 
newspaper editors 
baker said the government was exercising a certain amount of 
discretion when it informed an invitation commitee that visas 
would not be issued for the two marxist leaders 
i hope its not the use of censorship baker said in 
response to a question from james squires editor of the chicago 
tribune who had sought clearance for castro and ortega to appear 
before the convention in washington 
baker said the united states could not have normal relations 
with the two nations until us leaders are convinced they observe 
basic standards of human rights have democratic procedures and do 
not interfere in the affairs of neighboring countries 
once you start making exceptions you are on a very slippery 
slope he said 
vice president dan quayle also appearing before the editors 
was asked to explain why ortega was not allowed to come 
you are not going to learn very much from ortega coming up 
here and responding to your questions and making promises quayle 
said what we will learn by is going down and monitoring in 
nicaragua and seeing if youre going to have an electoral process 
established that will allow fair free elections 
you have the opportunity clearly to ask him questions in 
managua quayle said but as far as coming up here i really 
dont think that it would be that beneficial 
the united states has strained relations with nicaragua and no 
relations with cuba 
squires and other members of the editors group decided not to 
invite castro and ortega to speak to the convention after they were 
told by state department officials the two leaders would not be 
permitted to enter the country 
after bakers comments friday margaret tutwiler the department 
spokeswoman cited a presidental proclamation and us policy as 
grounds to deny visas to senior officials of the cuban 
government given ongoing cuban support for external subversion and 
internal repression 
she said she did not know why ortega would not be eligible for a 
us visa

to most of her classmates sara 
aldrete was a cheery wellgroomed honor student but some said the 
woman accused of being part of a murderous drugsmuggling cult had 
exhibited some bizarre behavior 
ms aldrete a resident alien was believed to be on the run in 
the united states she may be alone or with cult leader adolfo de 
jesus constanzo a 26yearold cuban who headed the drugsmuggling 
operation and committed many of the acts according to suspects in 
custody for the slayings 
by most accounts ms aldrete was a respected student at texas 
southmost college who dreamed of getting a degree in physical 
education but one student told the brownsville herald she 
sometimes wore necklaces which she told people not to touch because 
something bad might happen to them 
she would wear these metal medallions and she wouldnt let 
anybody touch them the unidentified student said as he spoke 
other students nodded their heads in agreement but they all refused 
to give their names the herald reported friday 
police say that in mexico she also was known as the witch 
one of about 10 members of a cult that kidnapped tortured and 
killed at least 13 people for revenge or in rituals aimed at 
protecting the groups members from harm 
she had one life in matamoros with what she was doing with 
these people in narcotics and worshiping said cameron county 
sheriffs lt george gavito and in the united states she was a 
student at tsc and all the sports she was involved in activities 
and was on the honor roll 
the friends over here didnt know much about what she was 
doing in mexico gavito said 
even her parents in matamoros knew nothing of the activities of 
their daughter who was president of the tsc soccer booster club 
and won the schools outstanding physical education award last year 
israel and maria teresa villareal last saw their daughter when 
she left the house a week ago earlier this week police raided the 
daughters upstairs room and found an altar with candles blood 
splattered on the wall and a burnt floor 
we were ignorant of this the parents told the houston 
chronicle 
one of the cults victims was mark kilroy a 21yearold 
university of texas premed student whose disappeared from 
matamoros during spring break kilroy was among those kidnapped 
killed and mutilated by the cult at the santa elena ranch about 20 
miles west of matamoros 
ms aldrete who often drove a 1988 model car equipped with a 
cellular telephone had received 855 in financial aid to attend 
the community college this semester she was in a workstudy 
program attending classes and also earning 335 an hour school 
records show 
ms aldretes teachers also were stunned by the allegations 
against her 
this whole thing is unbelieveable if anybody would have 
picked up on some of those occult characteristics in class i think 
it would have been me said tony zavaleta an anthropology 
professor who also specializes in folk medicine research and taught 
ms aldrete in several classes 
she was striking always wellgroomed neatly dressed always 
present in class she was the perfect student if i had a room full 
of students like her id be happy zavaleta said 
police were not sure how ms aldrete became involved with the 
cult and drugsmuggling group 
we know she is a major player and we are trying to find her 
said oran neck agentincharge of the us customs service in 
brownsville 
mexican and us authorities also were trying to piece together 
how others in the cult were recruited and zavaleta said it may 
lead back to ms aldrete whose striking features may have been 
used to lure other members into the flock 
mexican police say cult members took some orders from ms 
aldrete 
i just really will not believe all this until i hear it from 
saras own lips said marvine wallace a tsc physical education 
teacher

chinas population has reached 11 billion and 
officials said friday that the nations population growth is out of 
control despite a government policy allowing only one child per 
family 
chinese leaders in meetings publicizing the new figure said 
china will have difficulty feeding and housing itself if population 
growth is not checked 
the peoples daily said in an editorial that the large 
population has become the main obstacle to the development of the 
economy 
china reached the 11 billion figure a little more than seven 
years after becoming the worlds first nation with 1 billion people 
the government had wanted to limit the population to 12 billion 
in the year 2000 but officials and experts now acknowledge the 
goal is impossible 
estimates for the number of chinese at the turn of the century 
have jumped to 13 billion which would be about 20 percent of the 
total world population 
china daily quoted vice premier tian jiyun as saying 20 million 
more chinese would be born every year over the next decade if 
recent birth rates remain unchanged 
in 1988 china recorded 23 million births and 7 million deaths 
as a baby boom generation from the 1960s entered its childbearing 
years and defiance of state birth control policies spread 
china in 1980 adopted a policy calling for late marriages and 
one child per family couples giving birth to more than one child 
are fined or lose various social benefits 
it is estimated that chinas population would have grown by an 
additional 100 million during the past decade without the state 
policy the nationwide population growth was held to only 11 per 
1000 in 1985 a figure well below those of most developing 
countries 
however the growth rate rose to 14 out of 1000 in 1986 and 16 
out of 1000 in 1987 because of the second wave of the baby boom 
and the unpopularity of the onechild policy in rural areas 
the return of family farming has made farmers rich enough to pay 
fines for having extra children and has increased the need for 
children particularly boys to help cultivate the land 
according to one recent survey since 1980 about 9 million 
babies a year have been born outside the state plan and less than 
60 percent of women of childbearing age practice birth control 
tian noted the recent relaxation of the onechild policy in the 
countryside saying families who experience difficulties including

president bush and congressional leaders 
friday announced a showpiece budget compromise to reduce the 1990 
federal deficit to under 100 billion without raising taxes 
but the pact puts off most hard decisions and democratic leaders 
suggested it could open the way to tax increases next year 
bush flanked by top lawmakers at a white house ceremony 
boasted they had accomplished the first such agreement reached 
ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of a crisis he 
called it a first manageable step in the deficitfighting 
journey 
the plan would enable bush to say he is holding to his no new 
taxes campaign pledge while trimming the budget deficit to 994 
billion just within the 100 billion target set by the 
grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
under the agreement bush would be forced to accept lower 
defense spending and more spending for domestic programs than he 
initially sought in exchange congressional leaders pledged to 
abide by bushs antitax stance at least for one year 
but even as the accord hammered out the night before between 
administration and congressional negotiators was announced with 
great fanfare key participants conceded that it was only a 
skeleton that fell short of spelling out where specific programs 
should be cut to accomplish the savings it trumpeted 
no one should be deluded into thinking that this is the end of 
a process said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
it is the beginning of a process very hard choices lie ahead 
and another leading democrat senate finance committee chairman 
lloyd bentsen dtexas boycotted the rose garden session entirely 
although he joined other congressional leaders in attending a 
preceding white house session with bush to go over the compromise 
he declined to go out into the rose garden and have his 
picture taken because he doesnt like the agreement said bentsen 
spokesman jack devore 
the texas democrat told bush that hes concerned that it 
depends on wildly optimistic economic assumptions and there remains 
a great gulf between the congress and the administration on how you 
raise the 53 billion in new taxes bush is calling for the 
spokesman said 
still bush his top lieutenants and most congressional leaders 
were upbeat 
it is a major step toward a balanced budget said house 
republican whip newt gingrich rga 
major elements of the agreement include 
total deficit reductions of about 28 billion for the fiscal 
year that begins next oct 1 the projected 1990 deficit of 994 
billion comparesto a 1989 deficit estimated by the administration 
at 1633 billion 
defense outlays of 2992 billion down from 3006 billion 
proposed by bush in his feb 9 budget message to congress 
a level of discretionary domestic spending of 1813 billion 
up from the 1759 billion proposed by bush and spending in social 
programs in which benefits to individuals are mandated by law of 
5564 billion up from bushs proposal for 5314 billion 
a decision to adhere without specifying in what manner to 
bushs call for 53 billion in new tax revenue without enacting 
what the president considers a tax increase 
lawmakers said that newrevenues measure could prove to be the 
most thorny to negotiate 
in bushs budget much of this would come from additional 
revenues he expects to be gained from business growth spurred by a 
reduction in the tax on capital gains 
in my view the capital gains tax which was advanced by the 
administration has two chances of passage by this congress slim 
and none senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
told a later news briefing 
but budget director richard darman retorted i think if you 
had asked several people here what the chances would have been that 
we would be here in agreement on a budget resolution before april 
15th in the first year of the bush presidency the answers would 
have been slim and none 
the budget agreement deliberately puts off most decisions on 
specific spending increases and cuts for instance nowhere does 
it suggest where the money would come from to pay for bushs 
proposals to increase spending for educational programs for the 
homeless and for more environmental protection 
this is not an heroic agreement said house speaker jim 
wright dtexas if we begin with the assumption that there can 
be no significant major increase in revenue this agreement is 
about as good as we could do 
it cannot be emphasized enough that this is a first step no 
more and no less said house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif 
asked whether the nonewtaxes agreement was only a oneyear 
pledge panetta said that beginning with the fiscal 1991 budget 
i think everything has to be on the table taxes entitlements 
and defense 
sasser agreed saying next time were going to have to start 
looking for some revenues 
bush said the budget agreement does not complete the whole 
deficitreduction job but i am convinced that we will only be 
able to complete that job if we tackle it in manageable steps on an 
orderly basis in a constructive bipartisan spirit

soviet georgias communist party chief and premier 
were removed friday five days after they ordered troops to 
disperse a crowd of protesters in a bloody melee that killed 19 
people the kgb chief was named party leader 
nobody and nothing can justify the deaths of absolutely 
innocent people foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze himself 
an ethnic georgian said in a speech to the local party plenum that 
made the leadership changes 
he said in remarks later broadcast on soviet television that it 
was impossible to tolerate blunders by officials that led to 
death and loss 
shevardnadze party chief in the southern republic from 1972 to 
1985 and a member of the ruling politburo in moscow was dispatched 
to his homeland after sundays bloodshed 
the resignation of communist party first secretary dzhumber i 
patiashvili who had accepted responsibility for the tragedy was 
unanimously accepted by the partys central committee after 
heated discussion foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov told a news briefing in moscow 
givi g gumbaridze who has been georgias kgb chief for two 
months was elected to replace patiashvili gumbaridze 45 
previously served as party leader in tbilisi georgias capital 
city of 12 million people 
premier zurab chkheidze also was removed at a separate meeting 
of georgias presidium or top government body the official tass 
news agency reported nodari chitanava a central committee 
secretary was named the new head of the republics government 
tass said 
georgias president otari cherkeziya also offered to resign 
and the matter will be considered at the next session of georgias 
supreme soviet parliament which is empowered to remove him tass 
said 
tass quoted shevardnadze as telling the meeting that lessons 
from the incident were difficult and bitter adding that the 
events were detrimental to president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reform policies 
gerasimov gave no reason for the georgia shakeup but said 
earlier that leaders in georgia accepted responsibility for 
directing troops to clear a square of proindependence 
demonstrators in tbilisi on sunday at least 19 people were killed 
by official count 
the republics communist party newspaper zarya vostoka said 
local party leaders couldnt escape responsibility when a 
political decision taken by the leadership was carried out 
unfortunately in such a way that it led to heavy moral ethical 
and human losses 
signs posted at tbilisi state university after the clash outside 
local government headquarters called patiashvili a killer the 
49yearold georgian was elected first secretary in july 1985 
succeeding shevardnadze 
in shaking up their leadership georgian party officials were 
following a pattern set last year in the neighboring republics of 
armenia and azerbaijan after four months of nationalist protests 
there the armenian and azerbaijani party chiefs were fired 
apparently for their inability to halt unrest 
tass described the situation in georgia as stable friday with 
all enterprises in the capital working at full blast 
however the deputy director of georgias official gruzinform 
news agency zhorab lomidze said some businesses were not 
operating at normal levels because of a strike that began a week 
ago in tbilisi 900 miles south of moscow and the georgian partys 
politburo described the situation as strained with 
universities and schools still closed by boycotts 
leda archvadze sisterinlaw of arrested georgian human rights 
activist zviad gamsakhurdia said that outside government house 
the site of the confrontation a memorial has appeared 
spontaneously 
there are mountains of flowers every day people place fresh 
flowers she said by telephone 
an estimated 2000 people marched through the streets thursday 
for the first funeral for one of the victims psychiatrist zia 
djinjaradze according to a tbilisi human rights activist more 
funerals were planned for saturday and sunday said lomidze and ms 
archvadze 
a commission is investigating whether soldiers who broke up the 
protest had short metal shovels customarily used for digging 
trenches gerasimov said thursday he said the troops were not 
supposed to be carrying the shovels and that they could be 
punished if the commission finds they used them to beat protesters 
patiashvili has said he did not expect fatalities when troops 
were ordered out because they were equipped only with nightsticks 
and shields but several georgians who spoke in telephone 
interviews said the soldiers also had shovels 
in his televised remarks shevardnadze said it was georgians 
supreme duty to establish the truth about how their countrymen 
died 
in broadcast remarks blaming local officials as well as protest 
organizers for the weekend fracas he said 
one should not remain indifferent to any threats from 
irresponsible people who too freely interpret the notions of 
democratization and openness or people who occupy important posts 
but are not capable of giving up false principles of the past to 
any miscalculations and mistakes in implementing this policy 
especially when it is connected to death and loss

the government should get involved in 
investigating suspected scientific fraud by university researchers 
only after institutional procedures have been exhausted the head 
of an association representing 56 major us research universities 
said friday 
to hold open the threat of an office of government that can 
march in at any time and take over an ongoing investigation is both 
unnecessary and harmful said robert m rozensweig president of 
the washingtonbased association of american universities 
he said that as with government regulations on testing of human 
subjects and animal research the government can help to 
encourage and buttress institutional responsibility 
it is essential that there be clear statements that reinforce 
the primacy of the institutions role and that there be equally 
clear statements specifying the conditions under which the 
governments authority will be invoked 
in general that ought to be only after the institution has 
completed its work or if the institutional processes are found to 
be defective or if the institution itself asks for help 
rozensweig told a conference sponsored by the american association 
for the advancement of science 
rep john d dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee is planning to introduce legislation that would 
set up a special federal office to oversee the integrity of 
research activities 
in addition an institute of medicine panel recently proposed a 
series of recommendations to the national institutes of health to 
help deal with the problem of fraud and misconduct in biomedical 
research 
paul j friedman a member of the medical panel told the 
conference that the group urged lessening of the competitive 
pressures that encourage abuses of good research and authorship 
practices 
institutions were asked to give serious consideration to 
proposals to limit the number of publications reviewed for 
advancement instead of stressing productivity institutions would 
really concentrate on determining the quality of a small number of 
papers he said 
friedman associate dean of the school of medicine of the 
university of california at san diego said the panel recommended 
that by 1992 institutions receiving federal research funds be 
required to develop appropriate scientific and ethical 
standards 
he noted there have been proposals by congressional committees 
and the inspector general of the department of health and human 
services to conduct data audits on randomly selected scientific 
research experiments 
but friedman said the institute of medicine panel came out 
squarely against this idea regarding it as not likely to catch any 
determined cheaters but very likely to lead to interminable 
arguments about the selection and interpretation of research data 
it would inevitably be extremely costly in professional time 
and would pit a new investigative bureaucracy against the 
scientific community he said

the operating rate at the nations factories 
mines and utilities declined in march for the second consecutive 
month the government said friday in a report read as a sign that 
inflationary pressures are easing 
the federal reserve board said us industry used 84 percent of 
its capacity last month down from 842 percent in february and 
844 percent in january 
it was the first backtoback decline in the operating rate 
since augustseptember 1986 
i think this is unambiguous confirmation that the economy is 
slowing due to high interest rates a slowdown in trade improvement 
and some tapering off of the capital investment boom said 
economist jerry jasinowski of the national association of 
manufacturers 
the closer factories get to full capacity the greater the fear 
they will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand 
leading to shortages and price increases economists consider an 
operating rate of 85 percent as a clear sign that inflation will 
accelerate 
this report will help to alleviate the inflationary pressures 
that come from bottlenecks and shortages and excess demand it will 
certainly take some pressure off said economist cynthia latta of 
data resources inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
stock and bond prices rose sharply in early trading after the 
release of the report and another by the labor department which 
said wholesale prices in march had risen at a moderate 04 percent 
rate 
in a related report indicating sluggishness the federal reserve 
said the pace of industrial production was flat for the second 
month in a row in march leaving its industrial production index at 
141 percent of its 1977 base 46 percent higher than a year ago 
jasinowski said that although the central banks reports showed 
the economy slowing they did not yet presage a recession 
production dipped 01 percent at manufacturing plants after an 
identical rise a month earlier output at mines and oil wells rose 
05 percent after a sharp 15 percent decline a month earlier 
production at utilities dropped 05 percent after a large 23 
percent jump in february 
the output of automobiles and light trucks fell in march to an 
annual rate of 71 million units down from 72 million a month 
earlier however output of business equipment and construction 
supplies rose 
the operating rate at manufacturing plants dipped to 844 
percent last month from 847 percent in february and 849 percent 
in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years fell to 83 percent 
from 833 percent reflecting declines in fabricated metal products 
and automobiles and parts it was the third consecutive decline at 
auto plants to 824 percent in march the auto industry has been 
hit with slow sales this year 
at plants manufacturing nondurable goods the rate slipped from 
866 percent to 863 percent last month 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate rose from 812 percent to 816 percent at 
utilities the rate fell from 823 percent to 818 percent

two jailed terrorists ended a 
72day hunger strike friday after refusing a compromise offered by 
state authorities said a lawyer for the inmates 
several hours earlier supporters of the hunger strikers 
firebombed two banks in west berlin and smashed windows at a car 
dealership in hamburg 
damage was minor in the predawn attacks and there were no 
injuries police said 
sympathizers of the inmates members of the leftist red army 
faction have carried out at least six such attacks in the past 
three days 
attorney johannes pausch said christa eckes and karlheinz 
dellwo announced they were ending their hunger strike after they 
turned down a government offer to be housed in small groups with 
other imprisoned members of the terrorist group 
ms eckes and dellwo had refused all but water and vitamins 
since feb 1 in demand of a special cell block for all 28 convicted 
red army faction terrorists 
authorities have declined to provide specific information about 
the condition of the two 
at least 30 other inmates were taking part in the hunger strike 
but only ms eckes and dellwo had refused food continuously 
it was not immediately known whether the other hunger strikers 
would continue their action 
in a statement released by pausch ms eckes and dellwo said 
they were ending their strike to remove the tensions for a time 
the statement indicated the prisoners would resume the strike if 
they saw no signs that officials would seriously consider their 
demands 
at the prison in celle where 37yearold dellwo is serving a 
life sentence for murder and kidnapping an emergency medical team 
had been standing by to render aid said hartmut moellring 
spokesman for the lower saxony state justice ministry 
moellring said dellwo was weak but still able to walk at times 
he said dellwo had refused to be weighed or treated by doctors 
the red army faction has been responsible for carrying out 
assassinations and bomb attacks on west german businesses and on 
government and nato military targets since the early 1970s 
dellwo took part in a 1975 attack on the west german embassy in 
stockholm in which two embassy employees were killed he was 
convicted in 1977 and sentenced to two life terms 
ms eckes 39 was convicted in 1986 of belonging to a terrorist 
organization forgery and illegal possession of weapons she was 
sentenced to eight years in prison and is being held at the 
froendenberg prison hospital near dortmund 
a spokeswoman for a hungerstrike monitoring office set up in 
hamburg said ms eckes was in reasonably good condition 
considering the circumstances but she was placed in the prison 
hospital against her will 
the spokeswoman declined to be identifed by name

the communist party newspaper pravda accused the 
new political group democratic union on friday of seeking to remove 
the communist party from power and change the soviet unions social 
system 
it said there should be a law against such activities 
pravda said it was natural that in the process of perestroika 
or restructuring such organizations would emerge what is needed 
is legislative protection for perestroika and glasnost greater 
openness it said society should be guaranteed protection 
against extremism 
it said organizations like the democratic union which was 
formed last may can only harm the perestroika drive 
yuri mityunov a spokesman for the democratic union called 
pravdas allegations ridiculous 
ours is a very ordinary program mityunov said in a 
telephone interview we want pluralism equal opportunities for 
all 
he said that if the communist party had a better program to 
offer when voting time came we will vote for the communist 
party 
the democratic union says it wants elections with competing 
parties independent trade unions a new constitution and 
withdrawal of soviet troops from east europe and areas taken by the 
soviet union in world war ii 
the group has affiliates throughout the country but no 
membership count was available 
pravda said an analysis of democratic union documents circulated 
in leningrad showed the organization lifted more than twothirds of 
its program straight from the communist party itself on human 
rights political and economic reform questions of education and 
culture and relations with the church 
all this however is nothing more than camouflage it said 
the true aim of the democratic union as follows from its 
documents is to remove the soviet communist party from the 
political scene and change the social system 
the newspaper said that when new laws are drafted on the status 
of public organizations they should incorporate the right to take 
legislative steps to ban the activities of extremist organizations 
like the democratic union 
the pravda article said leningrad leaders of the democratic 
union which claims about 2000 members were of dubious character 
it said one leader once served prison time for burglary and a 
second was convicted of extortion swindling and currency 
violations 
mityunov said the pravda article is very weak there are no 
facts to substantiate its allegations

the secretarygeneral of japans governing party 
acknowledged friday that his wife was paid about 60000 in 
consulting fees from recruit co the firm at the center of a 
bribery scandal shaking the government 
shintaro abe also told a news conference i put my secretary 
entirely in charge of my fundraising affairs and neither my wife 
nor myself knew anything about it but i have found such a deal 
took place and i admit it was a result of my ignorance 
he confirmed news reports that recruit co a publishing 
conglomerate paid his wife yoko about 2300 monthly as a 
consulting fee from february 1986 to august 1988 he said the money 
was deposited into a bank account of his secretary who has been 
sick and hospitalized 
abe secretarygeneral of the liberal democratic party is 
considered japans most powerful poltician after prime minister 
noboru takeshita 
abe was foreign minister at the time the consulting fee was paid 
by recruit 
on tuesday takeshita told parliament that from 1985 to 1987 his 
political support groups had received 1 million from recruit and 
its subsidiaries with the money coming in the form of donations 
and purchases of party fundraising tickets 
takeshita was at that time the liberal democrats 
secretarygeneral 
about 17 politicians and 150 other influential people are known 
to have bought at discount prices hundreds of thousands of unlisted 
shares in a subsidiary of recruit and then received substantial 
profits when the share price soared after trading began takeshita 
has denied any personal involvement such stock transactions are 
not considered illegal 
but opposition leaders say recuit also paid millions to 
influential people as political contributions and expected favors 
in return 
fourteen people including two former vice ministers and an 
exchairman of nippon telegraph and telephone corp have been 
arrested on charges of bribery and securities law violations in 
connection with the affair former finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
and and two other cabinet members resigned after being linked to 
the scandal 
abes disclosures friday contradicted a declaration by the 
liberal democratic party earlier this year that no members of the 
current takeshita administration received donations from recruit 
after last summer 
opposition parties increased their criticism 
how can he abe not know about the deposits said yukihisa 
yoshida of the democratic socialist party it is extremely 
serious that he was receiving money even after the recruit scandal 
surfaced 
shun ohide a leader of the socialist party japans largest 
opposition group said abe has been reported to be closely 
linked to recruit and i think it fridays revelation was only 
part of it after all these revelations the liberal democratic 
party should resign 
takeshita has refused calls for his resignation vowing to carry 
out political reforms and restore public trust in his 
administration

mozambiques premier said friday the 
rebels fighting his marxist government receive aid from within 
south africa but did not accuse the south african government of 
providing it 
mario de graca machungo said the mozambique national resistance 
known by the acronym renamo has killed more than 100000 people 
and caused 6 billion in damage 
we know that most of their aid comes from inside south 
africa he said we are not sure whether south africa serves as 
a source or a transit point 
south africa and mozambique agreed in 1984 not to support rebels 
fighting each others governments mozambique closed african 
national congress bases on its territory and south africa pledged 
to stop supporting renamo 
government officials and private agencies held a pledging 
conference friday with a goal of 382 million in money and goods 
for mozambiques emergency needs in 198990 un spokesman salim

a judge blocked prosecutors friday from 
presenting key testimony in the trial of a christian science couple 
charged with murder for allowing their young daughter to die of 
diabetes without treatment 
former banker william hermanson 42 and his wife christine 38 
are charged with thirddegree murder and felony child abuse in the 
sept 30 1986 death of 7yearold amy the couple sought the aid 
of spiritual healers but not doctors 
defense attorneys successfully blocked the testimony of a family 
friend who said out of the jurys presence that amys parents 
obtained medical care for themselves but didnt get amy the insulin 
injections that could have saved her 
attorney charles arnold said the surprise testimony thursday 
violated state rules of discovery requiring lawyers to notify the 
other side of damaging testimony expected to be introduced 
the state acknowledged its inaction but gave no explanation and 
circuit judge stephen dakan ruled that the testimony was 
inadmissible dakan dismissed the sixmember jury until monday when 
the defense will present its case 
the judge reserved a ruling on a defense motion for an acquittal 
on grounds that the state had failed to prove anything other than 
that the couple were practicing their religion 
christian science doctrine relies on prayer and spiritual 
practioners rather than medicine to heal illness there are no 
sanctions however for followers who seek medical aid 
at issue the defense maintained is religious freedom 
the hermansons defense rests on a 1975 florida law that 
protects parents who withhold medical treatment from their sick 
children if the parents are legitimately practicing their 
religious beliefs 
assistant state attorney deno economou however insisted the 
hermansons knowingly let their daughter die 
in the disputed testimony family friend mary christman said she 
visited the hermansons three days after amys death and learned 
hermanson once had taken novocain for a tooth problem 
his wife suggested she had anesthesia during childbirth mrs 
christman testified 
i said god chris if bill had novocain and you had two 
caesarean sections how could you have done that without any 
anesthetic mrs christman told the judge and attorneys 
mrs hermanson replied well that was a different 
situation the friend said 
mrs hermanson also contended amys body would have rejected 
insulin because her husbands body rejected novocain mrs 
christman testified

winstonsalem nc ap a jury ruled friday that a 
25yearold man was insane when he shot four people to death in 
their cars and wounded five others while sheriffs deputies watched 
and waited for orders from superiors 
michael charles hayes 25 a former moped shop operator from 
davidson county was found innocent on four counts of firstdegree 
murder and eight counts of assault in the july 17 shooting rampage 
the verdict from the forsyth county jury was announced after 14 
hours of deliberations over four days 
superior court judge james beaty ordered that hayes be taken 
into custody and brought to the john umstead hospital in butner 
where he will undergo psychiatric treatment before a hearing 
the court finds reasonable grounds that michael charles hayes 
would probably be dangerous to himself and to others beaty said 
before sending him to the hospital theres a substantial risk 
that he would commit bodily harm to others 
hayes put his hand on his forehead and cried when the verdict 
was read in the halffilled courtroom family members of victims 
and some of the survivors also sobbed others reacted with anger 
there wasnt one crazy person in there there were 13 and you 
know who the other 12 are said gary hull brother of ron hull 
who was killed in the shooting spree 
nick nicholson father of one of the dead thomas nicholson 
said the families of the victims were shocked by the verdict i 
have no idea why they went the way they did he said 
after the shooting spree county sheriffs deputies were 
criticized for waiting for permission to shoot hayes as he 
brandished a 22caliber rifle ranting and flagging down cars 
dispatchers were criticized for telling deputies to stand by 
all the victims people making their way home on a welltraveled 
road at the end of the day were shot at close range before 
deputies finally wounded hayes in a hail of gunfire 
on the day before the rampage hayes family had tried to have 
him committed to a mental hospital 
this is the only verdict that should have been delivered in 
this case any other would have required that the jury did not 
follow the letter of the law defense attorney mike grace said 
prosecutor warren sparrow said the case was difficult

president ibrahim babangida appealed to 
nigerians friday to observe a government recommendation that 
families have only four children but he said no force would be 
used to limit births 
the west african nations population is estimated at 114 million 
with an annual growth rate of 33 percent the present average is 
six children per family 
let me stress that the policy is not a coercive measure and 
as such no special legal provisions for its enforcement have been 
made babangida said 
but he added if women space their child bearing at intervals 
of two or three years or they decide not to give birth after 35 
then they would probably bear not more than four children 
health minister olikoye ransomekuti has said nigeria seeks to 
reduce the growth rate to 25 percent in 1995 and 2 percent in 2000

pulitzer prizes dont impress national 
advertisers but fourcolor graphics and younger readers do 
newspaper editors were told friday by ad executives who said 
editors must show that newspapers are not dinosaurs but are a 
hot visible advertising medium 
newspapers must spruce up their images and use innovative ad 
campaigns if they want take ad dollars away from television and 
magazines the executives told a session of the american society of 
newspaper editors convention 
robert wehling vice president marketing services at the 
nations second largest advertiser procter amp gamble said surveys 
show that newspaper readers tend to be over 40 whereas advertisers 
want to reach under40 audiences 
magazines he said have better fourcolor printing capability 
and magazines tend to be read more than once newspapers he said 
get thrown out with the next days trash 
newspapers also are cluttered and their ads dont show products 
being used as well as television does wehling said 
most national advertisers see a significant cost 
disadvantage in using newspapers when compared with television 
and magazines he said 
there is simply no compelling reason for national advertisers 
to redirect dollars to the newspaper medium wehling said 
newspapers could help themselves by emphasizing regional ad 
campaigns by giving advertisers better positions and by trying to 
link local and national advertising campaigns wehling said 
he said one bright star for national newspaper advertising has 
been usa today where procter amp gambles ads have increased for the 
past three years and will continue to do so 
marianne caponnnetto senior vice president and media director 
at lord geller einstein oneill and partners in new york said 
usa today sales people were extremely aggressive 
but that was the exception she said adding that even though 
her jobs have included placing 50 million a year in ads for the 
international business machines corp she could count on one 
hand the number of newspaper sales executives shes ever met 
advertisers perceive newspaper sales personnel as order 
takers dull not creative and just looking to sell 
space she said 
part of the problem is that young ad agency executives are 
products of the tv age they dont read newspapers as much they 
want exciting ad campaigns and they dont want to expend their 
energies on quarterpage newspaper ads 
she also pointed out that a majority of americans no longer get 
most of their news from newspapers 
advertisers she said are indifferent to pulitzer prizes 
newspapers need to target special segments of their audiences 
geographically and demograghically she said 
added value approaches such as joint promotions research 
crossmedia programs and merchandising are being used by magazines 
to protect their rate cards 
all of your major competitors are adapting to the requirement 
of mixed marketing it is time for you to do the same she said 
she said newspapers have the potential to launch a strong and 
unified strategy that could open up significant opportunities for 
sustained growth 
it also is time for editors to take more aggressive roles she 
said and convince advertising craftsman that newspapers are a 
hot visible medium 
while you cant take the show biz away from tv you can make 
newspapers more appealing by demonstrating the inroads made in 
areas like reproduction in fourcolor by making newspapers more 
profitable for agencies by standardizing contracts invoices rate 
structures and by being more flexible with new positioning and 
layout ideas she said 
she urged editors to support your ad sales efforts to entice 
new and repeat business with special incentives be innovative 
the church and the state must work together to ensure the 
preservation of the species that doesnt mean that anyones 
integrity must be compromised but in a fierce survival battle 
youve got to operate as a team and understand one anothers 
business the best way to protect your credibility and integrity is 
to secure a sound business future

executives of three of the nations largest 
newspaper chains said consolidation in the newspaper business isnt 
necessarily bad and that it may help protect the industry from 
hostile takeovers by the apostles of greed 
the presidents of knightridder inc timesmirror and gannett 
co inc addressed the issue of public versus private ownership of 
newspapers in a session of the american society of newspaper 
editors convention 
they said that although those running publicly owned newspapers 
have to pay attention to the stockholders the financial bottom 
line wasnt managements only consideration 
we have a fine line to walk knightridder president james 
batten said weve got very solemn responsibilities to our 
shareholders because finally its their money 
times mirror president david laventhol said theres no 
question that we have to have some sense of responsibility to our 
shareholders and investors 
but he said the idea that new owners come in and the first 
thing they do is cut the editorial budget i would say is not a 
realistic view of what has happened to newspapers in this country 
that have been taken over by public owners 
the biggest impact that public ownership has probably had on 
newspapers is the ability of newspapers to invest much more 
extensively than in most cases they would ever do under private 
ownership laventhol said 
he said times mirror agonized over the sales of the dallas 
timesherald and the denver post but he said there have been large 
increases in editorial staffs at the newspapers that have been 
acquired by timesmirror 
in many instances despite all the rhetoric and clear pressure 
on profits there is another part of the newspaper business 
which is news and information to make this a better world and i 
think even in our giant public companies of the people sitting up 
here i think thats still a very primary motivation laventhol 
said 
gannett president john curley said the takeover threat was 
not from not the major players in the business but from 
people who are looking toward getting in deeper in the media 
business 
he said there also were apostles of greed who will try to 
break up big companies and sell off their assets to pay the junk 
bond deals that increasingly are financing large mergers 
the entrepreneuers however overlook the fact that once you 
sell some of the assets of some company there wouldnt be 
enough left to meet their drexel burnham bills curley said 
curley said there was too much emphasis on increasing profit 
margins to service debt from acquisitions 
in running the paper you ought to focus on the advertising 
side what the market can do realistically and then not try to 
penalize the news side if it cant be done at a level that lets 
say they can do in the sun belt curley said 
on the other hand i think weve got to be realistic that some 
markets arent ever going to grow and editors cant expect to add 
10 to 15 percent editorial costs annually just to do nice things 
when theyre not ever going to see that growth curly said 
laventhol said the news media will be takeover targets as long 
financing is available 
i dont think its going to go away but in a way many 
newspaper companies have gotten themselves in stronger position now 
to fight that kind of thing than say they were four or five years 
ago laventhol said 
batten noted entertainment mogul burt sugarmans failed attempt 
to acquire media general and rumors that the bass brothers of texas 
were moving around tribune stock 
there are a lot of straws in the wind that are worrisome 
batten said 
laventhol noted however that new owners are keeping 
newspapers alive and i dont know if thats a terrible thing

ahmed jabril leader of a group suspected of 
bombing pan am flight 103 denies that his organization had any 
role in the attack that killed 270 people in december 
while denying any connection with the bombing jabril 
acknowledged that his group routinely used the same kind of bomb 
investigators say was used to blow up the pan am jumbo jet 
a total of 259 people on the plane and 11 people on the ground 
perished when the bomb blew the aircraft out of the skies over 
lockerbie scotland 
in an interview broadcast friday jabril told abcnews that his 
first lieutenant hafez dalkamoni commonly built and used the type 
of explosive device that downed the pan am flight 
dalkamoni is in jail in germany after a police raid last october 
that netted weapons and three bomb devices like the one used to 
blow up flight 103 
jabril insisted that his group the syriansponsored popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command did not 
plant the bomb on the airliner 
jabril also denied that his group receives money from iran but 
said he shared irans outrage at how the united states last year 
shot down an iran civilian passenger plane 
i see now that the incident of the pan am is neither worse nor 
uglier than the destruction of the iranian air bus jabril told 
abc both of them are crimes against civilians whether by the 
us administration or by terrorist groups who may have blown up 
the pan am they are equally barbaric 
while denying his groups involvement jabril issued a warning 
should the united states or israel strike his camps in syria we 
shall not remain still our response shall be equal if not more 
violent he said 
despite jabrils denials investigators suspect that his group 
planted the bomb on an unwitting pan am passenger at the behest of 
iran 
and although he said the barometer type bombs were used only in 
the middle east german police found three toshiba radiocassette 
players similar to the one used to blow up flight 103 when they 
arrested dalkamoni last october

warning labels on cigarette packs do not 
give tobacco companies blanket immunity from lawsuits by victims of 
lung cancer and other smokingrelated ailments the minnesota 
supreme court ruled friday 
the ruling required a lower court to reconsider a lawsuit by the 
wife of a man who died of cancer four years ago after smoking 
filterless camel cigarettes for 30 years 
most lawsuits against tobacco companies have been dismissed 
before going to trial michael weiner an attorney for plaintiff 
ann forster called the decision against rj reynolds tobacco co 
maker of camels a major victory 
cigarette companies have been putting warning labels on their 
products since the 1965 cigarette labeling and advertising act but 
reynolds set out to do everything it could to show that that 
warning label is not true weiner said in arguing the case feb 
8 
jim fyock a reynolds spokesman in winstonsalem nc said the 
court had upheld the adequacy of the warnings and said he was 
confident the remaining points raised by the forsters would be 
rejected at trial 
when the case is returned to the trial court a central 
element of the proceedings will be the established adequacy of 
federally mandated warnings as a matter of law fyock said 
john forster a businessman who died at age 46 in june 1985 
sued a few months before his death 
he testifed that he began smoking partly because advertisements 
suggested that it was a grownup manly thing to do during the 
1950s cigarette companies advertised the socalled health benefits 
of smoking 
forster said he had been able to overcome a drinking problem 
but could never quit the highly addictive leaf despite hypnosis 
and acupuncture treatment 
weiner said that even after warnings appeared on cigarette 
packs forster continued relying on claims by the tobacco industry 
that cigarettes were safe 
john strauch a lawyer representing reynolds had argued that 
congress created the federal trade commission to regulate cigarette 
advertising and that it had not intended individual courts and 
juries to do it 
but legal consideration of the case does not conflict with ftc 
regulation so long as plaintiff does not claim the advertising 
was deceptive because it did not adequately warn associate 
justice john simonett wrote in the opinion 
weiner said thursday that the courts ruling leaves most of his 
case intact 
although the ruling states that reynolds warning is adequate 
it permits us to say what reynolds did do is misleading and 
thats the major thrust of the case weiner said 
the state of minnesota american cancer society american lung 
association american public health association and minnesota trial 
lawyers association joined his wifes case as friendsofthecourt 
forsters suit was dismissed in 1987 by hennepin county district 
judge jonathan lebedoff who ruled that the federal law preempted 
such claims 
last year the state court of appeals reversed lebedoff and 
ordered a trial saying it could not immunize the tobacco 
industry from lawsuits reynolds had appealed that ruling to the 
supreme court

robbie knievel soared easily over the caesars 
palace fountains friday night safely finishing the same motorcycle 
jump that nearly killed his daredevil father 22 years ago 
thousands of people who jammed the front of the resort cheered 
as knievel jumped his red motorcycle over the fountains and made a 
perfect landing on a ramp about 180 feet from his takeoff point 
the motorcycle landed at some 70 mph and he managed to avoid a 
nearby concrete pillar and stop the bike before hitting a wall in 
an underground parking garage less than the length of a football 
field away 
knievel triumphantly rode out of the garage and back up the 
landing ramp where his father evel knievel ran out to hug him 
that was for you dad i love you knievel said to his 
father who spent 30 days in a coma after missing the same leap in 
1967 
knievel landed just short of a huge white x on the 14footwide 
landing ramp and kept his hands on his handlebars as he soared over 
the fountains 
i thought i was going to land short like my dad and have to 
deal with that the daredevil said i wanted to do it with no 
hands but i held on because i thought i wasnt going fast enough 
knievel became the first stuntman and possibly the last to 
negotiate the fountains that critically injured his father and gary 
wells who crashed in 1980 
make it or miss it there will be no more jumps after this 
rich rose a caesars executive said earlier 
the daredevil was guaranteed 250000 for the jump but his take 
could be much higher depending on the payperview profits 
evel knievel watched from only a few feet away as his son landed 
easily and sped into the underground garage where a brain surgeon 
and a dozen paramedics were waiting for the worst 
im not the greatest daredevil in the world im the father of 
the greatest daredevil in the world the 50yearold knievel said 
it was the older knievel who made the jump famous and turned 
himself into a household name in the process when he crashed on 
landing and flipped like a rag doll through the parking lot and 
broke nearly ever bone in his body 
but robbie knievel made it easily much to the delight of the 
crowd of some 20000 people who jammed the las vegas strip and 
cheered as he made the leap 
im going to have to make the perfect jump he said this 
week i cant afford to be off even an inch 
and perfect it was as knievel after several aborted runs made 
the final run 
the jump capped a festive evening that featured willie nelson 
singing america the beautiful

families who traveled hundreds of miles 
from across mexico viewed mutilated corpses on friday to learn 
whether their missing loved ones were among the 13 victims of a 
cults human sacrifices 
from all over the country families have been coming here 
theyre still coming said hector olvera garcia an employee of a 
funeral home el rosario where seven bodies were taken after being 
dug up at a ranch west of this border city 
authorities found 12 bodies buried there tuesday and forced one 
of the five suspects in custody to dig up the 13th victim on 
thursday 
investigators have used bulldozers and other heavy equipment to 
excavate more of the ranch but did not find any more bodies said 
juan benitez ayala chief of the mexican federal judicial police in 
matamoros 
the suspects told police they killed 14 people because they 
believed it would protect them from harm authorities say they 
belonged to a bizarre cult that smuggled more than a ton of 
marijuana into the united states each week 
five of the 13 victims had been identified by friday and 
federal charges were filed against four men in custody in mexico a 
man and a woman thought to be the cult leaders and believed to be 
in the united states and two newly indentified suspects also 
believed to be in the united states 
the four at large in the united states were adolfo de jesus 
constanzo 26 nicknamed the godfather sara maria aldrete 24 
the godmother olvidio hernandez rivera 26 and alvaro de 
leon in his early 20s 
police on both sides of the border searched for the constanzo 
and aldrete the suspected leaders of the cult who last were seen 
in brownsville tuesday 
illinois state police were given a description of the car friday 
after authorities in brownsville texas just across the border 
from matamoros learned the pair have friends in the chicago area 
we think they might be coming this way said illinois state 
police master sgt clifford mann who added that constanzo known 
as the cults godfather and ms aldrete its witch had 
not yet been seen 
constanzo has homes in miami and mexico city 
the pall cast by the discovery of the gruesome human sacrifices 
remained most evident at the funeral homes in matamoros 
more than 60 people came in search of missing relatives olvera 
garcia said his clothes smelled of decomposing flesh after he 
showed the bodies to several people looking for relatives who had 
disappeared in recent months 
the worst fears of the family of ernesto rivas diaz 23 came 
true 
its something very sad said rivas diazs brother efrain 
who was picking up a death certificate for the young man who was 
exhumed from a shallow grave at the santa elena ranch 20 miles west 
of matamoros 
the certificate listed the cause of death as irreversible 
lesion to a vital organ brain 
police said most of the cults victims either died from blows 
with a machete or a hammer some suffered horrible mutilations 
including the removal of brains and other organs in what suspects 
have described as sacrificial rites of a cult seeking magical 
protection for their drugsmuggling activities 
the body of mark kilroy a 21yearold university of texas 
student was returned to the united states on thursday officials 
said his family returned to their hometown santa fe where a 
funeral mass is planned for saturday

rolled off the barge paul bunyan without incident said tom bauman 
a spokesman for the us department of energy 
friday the trailer will be moved about 13 miles and into a 
40foot deep trench where the reactor vessel will be left for 
burial bauman said 
the reactor vessel arrived at the port of benton on wednesday 
completing an 8100mile 44day waterborne journey from the 
shippingport atomic power station about 35 miles northwest of 
pittsburgh 
the station was built by the us atomic energy commission and 
commissioned in 1957 it was operated jointly with duquesne light 
co to provide power for the pittsburgh area 
shut down in 1982 the reactors dismantling and burial has been 
a pilot project for the decommissioning of other aging reactors 
because the reactor is owned by the federal government it was 
slated for burial at hanford 
hanford best known as a site where plutonium is produced for 
nuclear weapons is also the burial ground for the reactor 
compartments from four us navy submarines 
the reactor vessel which federal officials have said is 
lowlevel radioactive waste and not considered very dangerous went 
down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico through the 
panama canal and up the pacific coast to the mouth of the columbia 
protesters gathered at bridges above the columbia to say they do 
not want the river to become a highway for radioactive waste 
the reactor vessel is 45 feet high and 18 feet across and 
contained the nuclear fuel during operation the fuel was removed 
in 1984 and a nuclear reaction is no longer possible it is filled 
with concrete and placed in a 6inchthick stainless steel box

progesteronereleasing and coppercontaining 
intrauterine devices can provide safe and effective contraception 
for women in monogamous relationships during their middle or late 
childbearing years a medical study panel finds 
an estimated 60 million women worldwide use iuds the number in 
this country is about 2 million and only two companies market them 
in the united states after a series of expensive and 
wellpublicized productliability trials 
its a limited endorsement but on the other hand theres a 
large number of women who fit the criteria we set out for patient 
selection said dr william scott who chaired the american 
medical association panel that reviewed medical literature on iuds 
and released its finding in fridays journal of the ama 
we found the iud most useful for women in stable monogamous 
relationships who have already had their families and dont want to 
take the oral contraceptive pill either because of inconvenience 
or for fear of complications he said 
they iuds were not recommended however for women with 
multiple sexual partners those with a history of pelvic 
infections bleeding disorders or previous ectopic pregnancies 
progesteronereleasing iuds secrete the hormone progesterone 
which in turn prevents a fertilized egg from attaching itself to 
the uterine wall researchers believe copper as an iud component 
similarly inhibits implantation 
while iuds are ranked among the most effective means of 
contraception potential complications include perforation of the 
uterus and pelvic infection which can result in infertility 
quite frankly the severe health risks far outweigh the 
benefits gained especially with so many other effective methods 
of birth control already available in the us said guerry 
thornton jr an atlantabased attorney and productsliability 
specialist 
but if the medical profession is going to comment on this 
their warnings should be as explicit as possible said thornton 
who represented women in a lawsuit against dalkon shield 
manufacturer ah robins co which declared bankruptcy three years 
ago citing iudrelated litigation 
the panels findings were welcomed however by rod mackenzie 
chairman and chief executive officer at gynopharma the somerville 
njbased firm that last may began marketing the only copper iud 
sold in the united states 
were heartened mackenzie said but not at all surprised 
this has basically been the opinion of the medical profession for 
some time 
mackenzie declined to provide exact sales figures but said that 
75 percent of gynecologists in this country have bought the 
product from us and most have repurchased 
that fact and this report are two very encouraging comments 
he added

once the monday deadline for filing 1988 
federal incometax returns passes the average worker still will 
have to toil an additional 17 days before having earned what 
government tax collectors will demand for 1989 
tax freedom day arrives this year on may 4 it has not been 
later since the tax foundation began calculating this measure of 
the burden imposed on workers by federal state and local 
governments it was feb 13 in 1930 
by the foundations calculations the average worker will work 
124 days this year just to pay taxes so if the government 
demanded its money up front it would take all of the average 
workers income through may 4 
that is the same as the last two years in fact it is the same 
as in 1981 when congress and president reagan agreed on the 
biggest tax cut in the nations history

a century after earlham college started 
training quaker missionaries bound for asia its ties with japan 
are paying off as indiana maneuvers to cash in on that countrys 
growing us investments 
japan is the excuse but international education is the 
goal said jackson bailey founder of earlhams institute for 
education on japan we are very careful not to say come on get 
on the japanese bandwagon thats not the idea at all five years 
from now it could be something else 
meanwhile earlham has trained hoosier businesspeople in 
japanese language and customs and has helped 16 school systems 
introduce japanese curricula 
in gary school officials expect 300 students including 100 
fourthgraders to enroll next fall in introductory japanese a 
survey showed 512 of the 713 high school language students would 
like to study japanese 
theres an extraordinary interest said anne thompson 
supervisor of foreign languages for the gary community school corp 
japan is in the news this is a steel community the fact that 
america has lost the edge in the steel world and automobile world 
to japan is recognizable in this community 
subaruisuzu automotive will open an assembly plant with 
japanese management this year in lafayette the lafayette west 
lafayette and tippecanoe county school systems which have 
international students connected with purdue university have taken 
part jointly in earlhams program four high schools now offer 
firstyear japanese and study japan in art english and social 
studies 
it was certainly a welltimed opportunity for us to be 
involved in this project we spend a lot of time with the people 
from japan said charlotte mcgaw assistant principal at 
lafayette jefferson high school 
state superintendent of public instruction h dean evans and 
thengov robert d orr asked earlham four years ago to design an 
international education program earlham through a grant from the 
lilly endowment already had a pilot program that sent 
richmondarea teachers to japan for six weeks it now chooses five 
systems a year to send people for two weeks here and three weeks in 
japan 
for earlham its the manifestation of a centuryold 
relationship with what was once one of the worlds most closed 
cultures from 1893 when it graduated its first japanese student 
until world war ii earlhamtrained missionaries and educators 
headed for japan one as tutor to the empires crown prince 
the ties grew after world war ii when some of the 
japaneseamericans who had been interned chose to study at the 
indiana college they had learned about from the quaker 
conscientious objectors that also had been jailed 
bailey a conscientious objector who served in the army medical 
corps spent a year in japan during the occupation he later 
returned for three years with his wife and children as part of the 
quakers american friends service committee doing relief work in 
orphanages schools and neighborhood centers 
the immersion in the foreign culture converted me to 
international education you enrich your definition of what it is 
to be human said bailey who in december received japans order 
of the sacred treasure 
within four years of his 1959 return to earlham the college was 
operating a japanese exchange program for a group of midwestern 
colleges other programs were added in 1973 and 1979 and theres 
now talk of adding a fourth program so the school can accommodate 
all of its students who want to study in japan this year earlham 
a school of 1200 students had 65 studying firstyear japanese 
about 10 percent of the earlham faculty is bilingual in japanese 
and nearly onethird have worked there many through the 
sponsorship of the college which seeks out a japanese background 
in prospective faculty members japan pervades the curriculum from 
social sciences to fine arts and the school has adopted management 
methods that have proven successful in japanese industry 
that isnt to say however that earlham excludes other 
cultures more than half its students study abroad for at least six 
months compared with 1 percent of us college students who study 
abroad before graduating 
nonetheless school president richard j wood is counting on 
earlhams friends in japan to raise 1 million for an endowed chair 
in japanese studies we think it will be a recognition of the 30 
years of work weve done to raise the level of japanese studies in 
the united states 
because we were there long before there was a wave of 
interest we are trying to take advantage of that wave of interest 
the importance of japan to the american economy will not go 
down in the next 10 to 15 years

the left that startled the nation with its 
unity and a strong second place showing in last summers 
presidential election has tumbled back into disarray 
the fragile coalition has been unable to turn an outpouring of 
support for presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas into a solid 
front and has come out of a series of state and local elections as 
divided losers 
leaders say theyre not suprised but theyre not giving up 
they were four parties that had a single candidate for the 
presidency but nothing more said heberto castillo the mexican 
socialist partys presidential candidate who threw his support to 
cardenas a month before the july election and has worked with him 
ever since 
we could unite around a candidate for president but not for 
deputies and senators thats why we lost 
the four parties parties ranging from centerleft to left that 
were the core of the national democratic front have balked at 
giving up their names platforms claim to congressional seats 
share of government funds and privileges for the sake of a larger 
potentially more effective opposition 
one has effectively reallied itself with the longgoverning 
institutional revolutionary party pri in march a move leaders 
say broke the alliance 
the leftist parties engage in public and private infighting 
regional frictions add to national ones when the parties try to 
agree on joint candidates for state and local races further 
weakening their image 
although the front is still mentioned in connection with 
possible joint candidacies for state or local elections leaders 
say it was formed to fight the pri and likely will be replaced by 
another alliance 
we need a more suitable discreet type of conduct said 
sen porfirio munoz ledo a former head of the pri who became a 
leader and strategist of the leftist opposition if were allies 
we need to overlook many differences 
some members of the opposition applied march 31 to register the 
democratic revolution party which is to absorb the socialist 
party socialist leader castillo said the party is having a 
painful birth none of the others have agreed to join 
the democratic front came about because cardenas was a reformist 
who was shut out of the pri after he became the presidential 
candidate of a small leftist party and his popularity soared 
bringing endorsements of two similar parties and the socialists 
the largest leftist party 
in dealing the pri one of its worst blows in its 60year 
history cardenas took 31 percent of the vote the victor the 
pris carlos salinas de gortari was held to just over 50 percent 
the slimmest presidential victory ever for the pri the 
conservative national action party long the main opposition 
received 17 percent 
on cardenas coattails the left captured four of the senates 
64 seats the first ever won by the opposition and expanded its 
bloc in the chamber of deputies 
with national action it held the pri to a 10seat margin in the 
500seat chamber small parties at least one in danger of losing 
its registration gained needed votes 
the left blames the pri government known for coopting and 
manipulating the opposition for some of its troubles 
in addition to pressuring parties the government is using its 
strong influence over the news media and changes in local election 
laws to thwart the left castillo claimed 
the opposition was not allowed to register joint candidates in 
veracruz state elections in october but has had trouble even when 
permitted 
in baja california where cardenas won last year only cardenas 
party and one other could agree on a candidate for the upcoming 
governors race two others decided to back another or possibly 
the pri nominee there is even talk of an alliance with national 
action 
at the same time salinas has strengthened his image with 
attacks on union corruption and drug trafficking although his 
toughest tests will be foreign debt negotiations and electoral 
reform both under way 
lorenzo meyer of the colegio de mexico a graduate school said 
the left is going through what could be a healthy siftingout 
process but needs to offer a concrete program for the country 
with a mixture of good luck intelligence and will the 
hardships of today can be not the beginning of the end for the 
centerleft opposition but its difficult but necessary purgatory to 
achieve internal cohesion meyer wrote recently in a frontpage 
column in excelsior one of mexicos leading newspapers 
castillo said the new party wants political competition and 
better distribution of wealth but would respect the private sector 
at least 4 million of the 6 million votes officially registered 
for cardenas came from people outside the registered parties 
castillo said 
the political culture of this country is changing 
substantially he said before the july elections people 
thought it was impossible to defeat the pri now the people 
think it is possible

blair brown throws open the door of her dressing 
room et voila the pale blue dress she has just taken off is 
standing upright on the floor as if someone were still in it 
its been a long time since you wore clothes that could do 
that brown says of the polyester frock her attire for a 50s 
sitcom dream sequence in an episode of the days and nights of 
molly dodd being filmed on a soundstage in astoria queens 
thirteen new episodes of the offbeat comedydrama that left nbc 
last summer begin airing on the lifetime television cable network 
tonight 
in the episode being filmed the 12th of the 13 molly thinks 
she might be pregnant but isnt sure which beau is the father in 
the dream sequence molly is a sitcom mom flitting from tv to baby 
carriage to kitchen serving the demands of three undershirtclad 
husbands bookseller moss goodman david strathairn turned 
construction worker black detective nathaniel hawthorne richard 
lawson as grocer and doorman davey james greene still a 
doorman 
the cast is the same the look is the same but its a big jump 
from the no 1 network to a small cable channel 
if one more person comes up to me on the street and says i 
love your show when is it going to be on again or i love your 
show but i dont get cable brown said with a sigh i mean i 
feel were a little early in that sense for cable i bet in a 
couple of years this will all be very different 
its really disheartening that because you think well our 
work is better this year and yet fewer people can possibly see it 
nevertheless she and producer jay tarses are happy enough just 
to be in production 
theyve been unbelievably nice tarses said of lifetime i 
mean they want us they make us feel as if were the answer to 
whatever prayers they have and its a terrific feeling to not feel 
like somebodys stepsister at nbc they just kept putting up as 
many obstacles as they could hoping someday wed trip over one and 
eventually we did lifetime just wants us here theyre happy were 
here 
the series did well in the ratings and received raves from 
critics when it first appeared as a spring replacement on nbc in 
1987 the premise was simple brown as a divorced new york woman 
struggling with an irresponsible exhusband a fretful mom and a 
nonexistent career it wasnt mary tyler moore 
nbc didnt bring the show back until the following spring and 
then it got a slot in the boffo thursday comedy lineup following 
the cosby show when it landed only in the top 20 instead of 
the top 10 it was moved to another time period where its ratings 
dwindled before it was canceled 
lifetime which caters to female viewers with health and 
lifestyle shows and reruns of such series as cagney amp lacey 
picked it up last summer and tarses moved the production from los 
angeles to queens 
we figure next year well be working offshore brown said 
laughing well be the first offshore television show outside the 
20mile limit shooting on a boat and sending it back because they 
cant get rid of us try as they may 
ironically she noted the show is now shot on a soundstage next 
door to the cosby show 
tarses had complained at times bitterly about the way molly 
dodd was treated by nbc entertainment president brandon 
tartikoff who thought it too weird for a mass audience 
tartikoff stopped by the set recently and joked that he was 
announcing a network pickup tarses shrugged i like him he 
said hes got a job to do his job is to be no 1 
tarses will find out in may if lifetime wants to continue the 
costly production of molly dodd if not hes reluctant to 
return to a network nevers a long time he said but i hope 
i dont have to go back and do that again im willing if they 
give me a 66show commitment 
the split with nbc wasnt necessarily permanent even if it did 
get a little vitriolic in the press tarses does have an in at the 
network his daughter jamie is director of comedy development 
i did say i wasnt going to do anything for a while but 
theyd be crazy not to come back to me said tarses with a grin 
im a genius

the 101 milliongallon oil spill in alaskas 
prince william sound where emergency teams were unprepared and 
slow to respond has drawn attention to preparedness in california 
and the gulf of mexico where oil rigs and tankers make similar 
disasters possible ap writers janet mcconnaughey in new orleans 
and jeff wilson in los angeles found that a spill there the size of 
the one from the exxon valdez would be just as hard to handle 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the exxon valdez spill has focused the nations attention on 
alaskas oilfields but rigs are pumping crude and tankers plying 
the waters off other us shores that could be just as devastated 
and just as hard to clean 
and while cleanup companies backed by the oil industry say 
theyre poised to respond on a moments notice to spills along 
the california and gulf of mexico coasts state officials are leery 
of such claims and say the only way to prevent damage from oil 
spills is to prevent the spills 
the lesson of the valdez is clear we cannot rely on oil 
company representations that they can handle a spill said 
california controller gray davis who wants the coast guard in 
charge of directing cleanups to avoid the type of disorganization 
which seriously delayed action in alaska we cannot afford to 
sacrifice our coastline to bureaucratic bickering davis said 
more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled on good friday when 
the exxon valdez hit a reef near valdez alaska because a response 
team was disbanded in 1982 it took 11 hours before booms were 
placed around the fractured tanker and only about 8 percent of the 
spilled crude has been recovered 
i dont know as anybody would ever be totally prepared to deal 
with that quantity of oil said coast guard lt cmdr bob pond in 
new orleans 
i feel very strongly that if we had a spill of that magnitude 
we would not be able to contain it said bruce hammett emergency 
response coordinator for the louisiana department of environmental 
quality the thing we would have to look at is trying to minimize 
damage 
i just dont think we have the necessary booms manpower 
equipment and expertise to try to contain something like that 
hammett believes that planners along the gulf have grown 
complacent in the five years since the last major spill 27 
million gallons from the alvenus a tanker that ran out of a 
shipping channel and cracked open on a mud bottom near cameron la 
oil from the spill washed onto galveston texas beaches 
in the gulf of mexico three cleanup companies under contract to 
the coast gaurd have a total of 4600 feet of containment booms 
along with several boats pumps and skimmers to clean oil from 
water clean gulf associates a consortium of 166 oil and gas 
companies has 5000 feet of booms more than 39300 gallons of 
chemical dispersant and boats with equipment to suck up oil clean 
gulfs members must practice at least once a year with the cleanup 
equipment 
a spill of any size in the gulf would be fought under a plan 
developed by the states coast guard interior department and the 
environmental protection agency in california the coastal 
commission is responsible under state law for containing and 
cleaning spills it admitted in 1986 that it cant 
in the past two years the southern california coastline was 
polluted by 67510 gallons of oil of which 16035 gallons were 
never recovered more than 1150 tankers dock in los angeles every 
year and dozens of drilling platforms have raised concerns over 
federal plans to lease additional oil reserves an improperly cased 
well was blamed for a 1969 spill off santa barbara of more than 
325 million gallons of oil that dirtied 100 miles of coastline 
californias three industryfinanced cleanup cooperatives have a 
dc4 aircraft on standby in mesa ariz equipped to spray 2000 
gallons of chemical dispersants they also have a total of 100000 
feet of booms 30000 gallons of dispersants and about two dozen 
boats of various sizes equipped for cleanups 
but that equipment is in san francisco santa barbara and los 
angeles so the northern part of californias 800mile coast 
remains at risk that is the most vulnerable spot in terms of 
equipment said cmdr scott porter chief of environmental 
protection and port safety for the 11th coast guard district 
jack mortenson of clean bay conceded it would take a day for 
boats from his san franciscobased cleanup company to arrive in 
eureka near the oregon border 
whether we could arrive in eureka in time to be effective is a 
question of which direction the wind is blowing said mortenson 
adding there was some leeway because tankers travel at least 50 
miles offshore 
having no response ships in the north is one indication the 
oil companies arent as prepared as their public relations 
departments would have us believe said california lt gov leo 
mccarthy 
in the gulf louisianas fragile marshes are of great concern 
planners would rather see oil wash onto a beach than onto marshes 
where shrimp and fish spawn oysters are harvested and nutria and 
otter are trapped youre going to do more environmental harm by 
cutting out grasses and mucking through the estuary than you are 
going to help by cleaning the oil up said pond 
prevailing currents and winds that would steer most spills away 
from the marshes are the best protection louisiana has he said 
cleanup planning is harder in the gulf than alaska which 
exports just a few types of oil hammett said here in the gulf 
we receive just about every variation on crude oil imaginable 
and each crude oil is different from the next you have to look at 
the toxic effects of each oil and what is at risk at various 
times of the year whether seabirds are nesting mammals having 
young whether its shrimp season oyster season what have you 
in addition the gulfs shipping hazards production platforms 
and crowded shipping lanes dredged through shallow bottoms can 
hamper cleanup the rigs can snag and tear booms which dont work 
too well unless the water is calm 
if you dont have booms there very quickly the oil is going 
to spread quickly in all directions on the surface pond said 
youd just need an enormous amount of boom to even think of 
containing it 
california coastal commission documents show that skimmers the 
main mechanical tools for cleaning up oil work best in absolutely 
calm waters but even then skimmers pick up only about 50 percent 
of the oil they can reach as waves reach about 2 feet the 
recovery rate drops to between 20 percent and 30 percent with 
sixfoot waves skimmers are virtually useless 
the other method for breaking up oil spills pouring 
dispersants into the water is controversial because of the 
toxicity of the chemicals 
i think there is no question that a large incident such as 
occurred offshore in alaska could occur off shore in california 
said peter douglas executive director of the california coastal 
commission 
we are at risk said kim mccleneghan of californias fish 
and game department

they are former radicals whose thriving career as 
a bestselling team of authors is testament to their rebirth as 
conservatives 
and their impassioned defense of the right is not unlike their 
crusade on behalf of the left two decades ago 
but given their dramatic change in politics and lifestyles 
peter collier and david horowitz may have a more highly developed 
sense of irony witness the tshirt horowitz wore during a recent 
publicity tour to promote their latest book destructive 
generation second thoughts about the 60s summit books 
1995 
the words in russian emblazoned above a red star translated to 
god bless america 
collier 49 and horowitz 50 became friends while graduate 
students at the university of california at berkeley and later 
edited the leftist magazine ramparts they are the authors of 
three successful books the rockefellers an american dynasty 
the fords an american drama and the kennedys an american 
epic 
collier does the majority of the writing and horowitz does much 
of the legwork their most successful book was the kennedys 
which was also the most controversial its 1984 publication 
coincided with the drug overdose death of david kennedy 
now comes the nagging destructive generation which makes 
tom haydens transition from fiery radical to california 
legislator or jerry rubins transformation from yippie to 
corporate networker seem mild by comparison 
collier and horowitz who bill their new book as the first to 
examine the 1960s in a critical light are not unlike unruly 
schoolboys who have suddenly surfaced as hall monitors 
in their own words they see themselves as spokesmen for a 
generation of people who refuse to be responsible for what theyve 
done 
the 60s were a great party now its the big hangover said 
collier most of whats been written up to now have been attempts 
to romanticize the 60s were trying to provide an antidote to 
that 
their thesis is stern and unyielding the 60s was a time of 
naive idealism rooted in an inherent destructiveness 
collier and horowitz argue that the antiwar antiauthority 
prodrug culture of the 60s resulted in a breakdown of the system 
and the destruction of authority far from offering concrete 
remedies for society 60s leftists came up with jerrybuilt 
solutions that turned out to be disastrous 
there was a basic social lawlessness in the 60s collier 
said we romanticized crime figures we romanticized drugs we 
attacked authority at every level the epidemic of crime is 
directly related to drugs 
when youre young you have great optimism said horowitz 
who recalls being taken to many sovietmade movies by his parents 
both avowed communists its naivete at one point and then it 
becomes destructive 
destructive generation much of which originally appeared in 
magazines such as playboy rolling stone and california chronicles 
what are seen as the ultimately ineffectual lives and times of 
black panther defense attorney fay stender and the weather 
underground 
the personal odyssey of collier and horowitz from zealous 
marxists to staunch reagan supporters is tacked onto the end of the 
book 
when they talk politics now they praise authority figures 
rather than revile them 
we saw what reagan did said horowitz explaining their long 
evolution from left to right he restored pride in this country 
reagan helped people who were looking for freedom all over the 
world 
as part of the publicity tour for the book collier and horowitz 
already have engaged in several television debates with prominent 
members of the left the exchanges have been heated 
the two are quick to point out that they have lost many friends 
since joining the conservative cause they also are prone to 
defensiveness when asked questions they perceive imply that they 
sold out for the sake of writing lucrative best sellers 
they claim they paid a high price for their journey from humble 
radicals to popular authors were stigmatized as troglodytes 
said collier 
when i lived inside the marxist myth it made me very 
strong said horowitz when i lost my faith i lost my 
confidence i was no longer part of something which gives you 
strength 
next on the collierhorowitz agenda a biography of the 
roosevelts

on april 25 1974 soldiers under the 
command of young leftleaning army captains toppled a 48year 
dictatorship and were showered with red carnations by rejoicing 
civilians 
fifteen years after the revolution of the carnations the 
portuguese armed forces are back under rightwing leadership 
facing flagging popularity and an urgent need for reform 
the decision by prime minister anibal cavaco silva a social 
democrat to name the conservative gen antonio soares carneiro as 
armed forces chief over the armys own more moderate candidate has 
stirred discontent even within the military 
the controversy comes at a time when cooperation between 
generals and politicians is seen as important for the success of a 
fouryear plan to trim military manpower and modernize equipment 
soares carneiro was not chosen by the army it was obviously 
some sort of political compensation said maria carrilho a 
leading sociologist and author of the armed forces and political 
change in 20th century portugal 
it shows party politics and the military are still too closely 
interconnected in portugal something that shouldnt be the case in 
a consolidated democracy 
in 1980 soares carneiro ran for president as the candidate of 
the conservative alliance that joined the social democrats with the 
rightwing social democratic center 
his campaign collapsed after reports were published that he had 
authorized the internment of opponents of the portuguese 
dictatorship in a recuperation camp in angola toward the end of 
portugals african colonial wars in the early 1970s 
former officers who took part in the 1974 revolution say a 
traditionalist resurgence in the military is likely to further 
taint the forces already flagging prestige among portuguese youth 
in the period following the revolution soldiers were the only 
ones the people would trust said lt col vasco lourenco a 
revolutionary captain in 1974 today the armed forces are almost 
ashamed to have had anything to do with april 25 and have withdrawn 
into a shell 
ms carrilho said that since the abolition in 1982 of the 
governing revolutionary council which was dominated by the 
military politicians have moved anybody linked to april 25 out of 
influential positions 
lourenco who now heads the private april 25 association he 
cofounded after military and government formally split in 1982 
complains that military men today havent been able to make 
civilians understand the role of the military in democratic 
portugal 
nowadays the armed forces sense a certain rejection in 
portuguese society said lt col otelo saraiva de carvalho the 
mastermind of the 1974 coup who was sentenced last year to 15 years 
in prison on charges of being the leader of a leftwing urban 
terrorist group 
although the masses still have a soft spot for the soldier of 
april 25 he said in a prison interview people are now asking 
why do these guys exist portugals not at war so what are they 
doing they dont produce anything 
a recent survey by lisbon university indicated that 66 percent 
of recruits performing obligatory military service think the draft 
should be done away with and that service in the armed forces 
should be voluntary 
with relations improving between the united states and the 
soviet union its natural that young people all over the world are 
asking themselves what the armed forces are for said gen amadeo 
garcia dos santos who sees reform long overdue 
the army today is more or less what it was before the 
revolution in terms of structure mentality and equipment 
military analysts say portugals 90000member armed forces are 
still large for a small country of just over 10 million people 
even though it is a member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the need for large land forces to fight the colonial wars in 
africa has left an imbalance among the three service branches 
the army has about 45000 active soldiers making it three times 
larger than the air force and the navy 
but this could change as portugal strives for a more active role 
in nato 
according to alvaro vasconcelos at lisbons institute for 
international and strategic studies portugals aim is to play a 
more important role in antisubmarine warfare which would require 
greater naval and air strength

christian protesters claim to have 
increasing influence on commercial advertisers on television 
the american family association based here called off its 
boycott of the pepsi cola co after the company dropped plans to 
run more ads featuring segments of pop star madonnas video like 
a prayer 
the christian association had called for a pepsi cola boycott to 
protest what it considered sacrilegious imagery in the sensual 
video roman catholic bishop rene h gracida of corpus christi 
texas also had urged people to boycott pepsi products 
we think pepsi has made a very wise business and moral 
decision the rev donald e wildmon afa executive director 
said after the ad was withdrawn 
in announcing the move pepsi cola did not acknowledge that the 
christian protests influenced its decision the company said 
however that many people seemed to be confusing the video and the 
pepsi ad which did not include the video segments most objected to 
by those protesting the performance 
wildmon also noted that some advertisers canceled ads on the 
show saturday night live after protests of the programs 
contents by the association 
more and more corporations are beginning to say no to the 
exploitative and antichristian programming of the networks he

measured by the emotions generated the minimum 
wage bill now being refined by senatehouse conferees is a 
significant legislative effort a threatened veto by president bush 
adds to that impression 
measured on its potential economic impact on the national 
economy however it may be a far less important piece of 
legislation to some extent it is merely recognizing what already 
has occurred 
in large areas of the country for instance employers long ago 
gave up efforts to hire unskilled help at the minimum wage of 
335 for many months they have been offering considerably more 
even double the minimum 
the 335 wage has been in place for eight years a period 
during which almost every fulltime worker received some sort of 
raise if only to keep pace with inflation in effect the minimum 
wage went backward during this time 
the senate and house bills that have just been passed would 
raise that wage to 455 an hour by october 1 1991 or more than 
two years from now but even then it would hardly match the wages 
available today in many states 
that is not the only reason why the impact might be muted 
another is that 11 states already have higher minimums than the 
federal rate still another is that many companies have the option 
of automating instead of employing 
in fact one of the sturdiest arguments against raising the 
minimum wage rate is the belief that small companies will simply 
eliminate minimum wage jobs and large companies will seek to 
automate such positions out of existence 
further support for the minimum wageminimum impact argument is 
evidence that workers with potential seldom stay at the lowest wage 
anyway usually advancing to higherpaying jobs or quitting 
in spite of this evidence great emotions are generated whenever 
the minimum wage is discussed and sometimes they are justified 
a higher minimum wage costs jobs says the minimum wage 
coalition to save jobs selfdescribed as a broadbased 
organization opposed to any increase in the federal minimum wage 
it also generates inflation the group says 
one of the more disturbing contentions is that the minimum wage 
is promoted as something it is not it cannot improve the lot of 
the poorest workers it is said because minimumwage jobs often go 
to higherincome families 
according to this argument many of the lowest paid positions 
are occupied not by the unskilled but my secondary earners often 
women and teenagers whose incomes merely add to a households 
primary income 
in retailing says economist william dunkelberg 70 percent of 
minimumwage recipients are from families with incomes more than 
200 percent above the poverty level lowincome workers he says 
make up 10 percent of the total 
but while the impact on the economys direction might be almost 
imperceptible and the goal of helping the neediest might be 
missed the bills passed by the house and senate might very well 
have serious impact 
very small businesses are concerned because small increases can 
represent a large percentage of earnings depressed economic areas 
where wages are lower than the minimum would feel a greater impact 
than would stronger regions and businesses everywhere might find 
more paperwork and compliance worries 
but the impact on the economy as a whole isnt likely to be 
impressive and there might be no impact at all if president bush 
does indeed veto the matter before it is enacted

the jagged reef that ripped open the wandering 
exxon valdez and dirtied prince william sound also reopened the 
debate on requiring a second layer of steel as an added safety 
factor on supertanker bottoms 
this spill raises a red flag we may not have sufficiently 
stringent design requirements said clifton curtis president of 
the oceanic society based in washington dc 
its a worldclass catastrophe a benchmark for the worstcase 
spill ever curtis said it does call again for reexamination 
of tanker design theres lots of support to require double 
bottoms 
a double bottom is a second skin covering a ships underbelly 
it creates several feet of insurance space that must be penetrated 
before cargo holds leak 
but it would have also reduced the capacity of the exxon valdex 
and added an extra 1015 percent to the 125 million cost of the 
tanker launched with a single hull in 1986 in full compliance with 
us and international law 
industry analysts argue that double bottoms work if a ship runs 
aground on a softer sandy bottom but are ineffective against 
treacherous outcrops such as bligh reef the extra bottom when 
breached can also fill with seawater and cause a tanker to capsize 
and break apart 
double bottoms are not the cureall people think it possibly 
could lead to a worse spill said sean connaughton of the 
american petroleum institute 
you can have the best designed ship with the most modern 
equipment and best trained crew in the world and you can still 
have accidents like this he said if you want to get rid of 
the problem of oil tankers dont ever use any oil 
the force of the good friday accident would not have kept the 
exxon valdez from hemorrhaging oil even if it had a double bottom 
although some officials believe it could have curbed the amount of 
goo lost 
the ship longer than three football fields cruised through the 
calm night on a routine run carrying 52 million gallons of oil a 
31650horsepower engine pushed it at 15 miles an hour 
it had magnetic and gyroscopic compasses an electronic 
direction finder two radar systems a satellite navigation system 
and two steering systems that work independently in case one fails 
everything necessary to keep a proper course 
but its captain joseph hazelwood who had lost his privilege to 
drive cars on land because of two drunken driving convictions had 
too much liquor in his blood and was in his private cabin 
in the hands of an unqualified third mate the supertanker 
strayed more than a mile out of shipping lanes and rammed an 
undersea mountain 
holes as wide as 20 feet rent eight cargo holds but even if a 
double bottom were mandatory the damage would have penetrated the 
6 feet of space required for the exxon valdez officials said 
i dont think we could have designed any vessel to withstand 
the kind of catastrophic damage this vessel was subjected to 
said cmdr mike williams of the us coast guard 
we would have had pollution even if the vessel had a double 
bottom williams said nothing weve ever done has taken human 
error out of the loop 
in a touch of haunting irony an exxon official discussed human 
error in george sullivans 1978 book supertanker which 
described the design and construction of the thennew and 
astonishing megaships being built specifically for the oil trade 
accidents are the direct results of people on ships william 
o gray a former senior adviser in exxons transportation 
operations division said in a chapter on accidents 
in 1977 president carter advocated double bottoms for 
supertankers but was willing to accept alternative ways to limit 
oil pollution 
the next year a compromise with international shippers kept the 
extra bottom from becoming us law the intergovernmental marine 
organization a un agency based in london adopted segregated 
ballast as a safety feature that would reduce the incidence of oil 
slicks 
the ballast tanks empty when a ship is fully loaded carry 
water when it is empty this ended the practice of filling cargo 
tanks with water for ballast and then flushing the gloppy residue 
into the ocean the segregated tanks which are placed around a 
tankers sides serve as cushions in case of collision 
the side tanks were desired because accidents were 15 times 
more likely to damage a ships side than its bottom according to 
coast guard studies side damage came from collisions with other 
ships which often resulted in fires and explosions 
whats more a national academy of sciences study in 1973 said 
80 percent of oil pollution came from operational practices such as 
flushing tankers with sea water accidents made more headlines but 
did only 20 percent of the environmental damage 
the imo requirements were contained in the us port and tanker 
safety act of 1978 so far 55 countries representing 81 percent of 
the worlds merchant tonnage have complied 
worldwide 3200 oil tankers sail the oceans bearing 24 million 
barrels on any given day each of them is a potential disaster 
the oilthirsty united states which has 200 commercial tankers 
imports 8 million barrels a day about 80 percent of it by water 
of the 72 us flagships that have operated in alaska about 25 
percent have double bottoms the coast guard said 
before the alaska pipeline was built to terminate in valdez 
thensecretary of interior cb rogers morton promised congress in 
1972 that double bottoms would be a safety feature 
newly constructed american flag vessels carrying oil from port 
valdez to us ports will be required to have segregated ballast 
systems incorporating a double bottom morton said 
the promise wasnt kept but groups such as the oceanic society 
the environmental protection institute and friends of the earth 
hope the spill has the same impact on tanker regulations that three 
mile island had on the nuclear industry 
in the wake of the spill they favor double bottoms on all us 
tankers by the year 2000 
environmentalists also have an ally in arthur mckenzie director 
of the tanker advisory center in new york he spent 11 of his 40 
years as an exxon corp employee on tankers 
if a double bottom is strong enough it may eliminate or 
reduce a spill mckenzie said you can never stop catastrophes 
but you can minimize them

reiko sekiguchi a 55yearold college professor 
went to court when her employer ordered her to use her husbands 
name 
just a few years ago in japan that would have been unheard of 
women never went to court 
my name is my right said ms sekiguchi who has published 
scholarly works under her maiden name for 20 years 
women increasingly are using the legal system to press for 
changes in japans maledominated society their demands include 
the right to retain their maiden names to receive joint property 
and child support after divorce and to equal treatment in the work 
place 
by choosing the courts they might change the way disputes are 
settled in japan 
in general lawsuits are increasing because everyone is 
starting to think more about ways to improve their lives said 
mizuho fukushima ms sekiguchis lawyer in the name case 
more women are filing lawsuits than ever before and with more 
women working and more in executive positions they will be able to 
better afford the costs of lawsuits in the future 
a group of lawyers and professional women led by ms fukushima 
is lobbying the justice ministry and the diet japans parliament 
to change a law that requires married couples to take the last name 
of one or the other spouse more than 98 percent of wives take the 
husbands name 
ms sekiguchis suit which is against the university of library 
and information science in tsukuba challenges that law 
ms fukushima expects it will take five to 10 years for the 
lawsuit to proceed through the court system and for her groups 
lobbying efforts to bear fruit 
she pins more hope on the changing practices of some of japans 
leading companies which are starting to allow women to use their 
maiden names 
women also are taking the lead in divorce cases until the early 
1980s most divorce actions were begun by men but in 1985 women 
filed 74 percent of the divorce actions in the tokyo family court 
middleaged women who have spent 15 or more years caring for 
working husbands and raising children have become the 
fastestgrowing group to initiate divorce actions 
because of the lack of closeness in their marriages middle 
age women have become emotionally independent said sumiko iwao 
a psychologist at tokyos keio university but japanese men are 
emotionally dependent on women they still believe that when they 
retire they will be waited on by their wives as a reward 
lawyer kurumi nakamura of tokyo said lots of women wanted 
divorces 10 years ago too but they thought they were supposed to 
be patient about an unhappy marriage nowadays they dont care 
what other people think about divorce its more acceptable to 
fight back 
almost all divorces are resolved by agreement between the 
spouses or through arbitration although 80 percent of women win 
custody of their children few get their share of either the 
couples property or child support 
almost 95 percent of separated divorced or unmarried mothers 
received no financial support from the husband or father of the 
child according to a survey in 1986 by the tokyo bureau of social 
welfare 
ms nakamura conceded that despite stronger demands by her 
clients for half of the couples property at divorce they rarely 
get it but property awards to women are gradually increasing 
the tendency is for women to question what their rights are 
and to examine how to attain happiness ms nakamura said one 
day it will seem very natural for them to go to court 
in another case 33yearold librarian hisako kawaguchi is suing 
her employer for transferring her husband who is employed by the 
same company to a city 170 miles away 
in japan company transfers are common and families are often 
divided for years because of them 
mrs kawaguchi argues in her suit that the teikoku hormone 
manufacturing co violated a legal right for married couples to 
live together and jointly care for their children 
when mrs kawaguchi told the company that her health would not 
allow her to keep her job and care for her three children alone it 
replied that family circumstances were irrelevant she said 
mrs kawaguchi told kyodo news service she believed the real 
reason for the transfer was to force her to resign since the 
company preferred a younger woman for her job

put some racy glittery commercials with lots of 
naked bodies on movie screens in france and the audience goes wild 
but do the same thing in the united states with the glitz but 
without the nudity and the ads go over as big as sticky floors 
stale popcorn and overpriced candy 
richard dodderidge senior vice president for corporate 
marketing at amc entertainment in kansas city mo said when amc 
tried the ads in theaters audiences went beserk 
there was public displeasure indicated by throwing popcorn 
boxes at the screen and people wanting their money back he said 
they left home to avoid commercial television they paid money 
and expected relief 
ive been in theaters where people booed said barbara 
lippert advertising critic for ad week magazine on paper they 
sound great but they can only be successful if theyre really 
artfully done and surprising 
in france audiences get about 30 minutes of commercials which 
must by law be 90 percent entertainment in american theaters 
though audiences who are often asked to pay as much as 10 a 
ticket resent the intrusion 
the ads would have more staying power if they helped lower 
ticket prices said ed swanson senior vice president of sales and 
marketing for modern talking picture service in chicago which 
distributes corporatesponsored films he recalled a recent movie 
outing with his family in which he paid 22 for four tickets 
after a 50 dinner check if id have sat there and seen a 
commercial id have been peeved 
nobody likes commercials said terry laughren president of 
screenvision cinema network a new yorkbased company that 
distributes commercials but theres a tremendous fascination in 
this country for good advertising 
the clutter of commercials on television has been one force 
behind the advertisers quest for a more captive audience toyota 
motor corp general motors corp 7up dr pepper lee jeans 
pepsi co memorex and the us marines have reeled out dollars to 
give movie advertising a try 
it seems to be growing pretty steadily said larissa 
alexandra vice president of screenvision in los angeles with 
tv what you are trying to do is talk through clutter to get some 
attention theres no chance to get the emotional aspects of the 
product 
creators insist the ads are distinctly different from typical tv 
commercials and some of them can be edited for television 
dave danzer national advertising manager for toyota said the 
directors hired to do the ads often have experience with feature 
films and stunts such as car chases he refused to divulge how much 
toyota spends on theater ads 
one of screenvisions most recent commercials features toyota 
it is hard to find anybody who reacts negatively said 
laughren about the ad to the concept yes there is negative 
reaction but then they say oh god that was a great 
commercial 
in the toyota ad which danzer likens to the adventure formula 
of raiders of the lost ark a man dreams hes being chased 
through a jungle in his toyota fourwheeler by an imaginary threat 
theres no dialogue until he wakes up looks out his window and 
sees his toyota sitting outside then an announcer says toyotas 
new v64x4 get it before it gets you 
danzer didnt know if the ads helped sales but he said they 
were especially good at reaching males 18 to 34 years old who are 
typically light tv viewers 
in the theater 95 percent of the people see your ad danzer 
said they might be eating popcorn but they see the ad with 
television you have no idea whether they are going to look at it 
michael bernacchi a professor of marketing at the university of 
detroit has studied theater advertising and thinks companies 
increasingly will want to see their products featured on the big 
screen 
right now its an outstanding way to communicate with 
consumers he said viewers will tend to receive them with 
more interest and maybe chagrin they may reject them in their 
hearts but they are probably going to stay in the saddle and 
witness them 
the reason is a moviegoers state of mind bernacchi said the 
expectation is much different when people actually seek 
entertainment 
few people go to the movies with the idea of just sitting and 
casually attending you go there with a purpose he said 
bernacchi thinks the ads will thrive because in theaters there 
is much less competition for a viewers attention and because the 
cinema unlike vcrs dont offer the option of handheld controls 
however some theater chain executives are less optimistic they 
say reaction from audiences has been so overwhelmingly negative 
they risked losing business if they didnt pull the ads 
weve tried it from time to time in different parts of the 
country said russ duncan chicago regional manager for general 
cinema the company felt the good will between the patrons and 
the company was somewhat compromised and we valued the good will 
of the patrons more than running the ads

a usiraeli team with 
remotecontrolled yellow submarines the size of sea turtles is 
searching the bottom of the sea of galilee for underwater salt 
wells 
but they also have taken the time to look for remnants of a 
battle between jews and romans in 67 ad when 6700 jews were 
believed to have been killed 
the submarines were brought to israel by us marine scientists 
its the first time we can see for ourselves what the bottom 
of the lake looks like said tom berman director of the kinneret 
laboratory for limnology on galilees northern shore kinneret is 
the hebrew name for the sea of galilee 
project director richard cooper a marine scientist from the 
university of connecticut said submarines are superior to divers 
because they go as deep as 1000 feet and more importanly in this 
case can stay under water for as long as 10 hours 
one recent day aboard the projects control boat anchored a 
little over a mile offshore cooper lowered one submarine equipped 
with a tv camera still camera and strobe light into the lake to 
look for salt water craters 
geologists biologists and marine scientists gathered around a 
small monitor on deck to analyze the tv cameras pictures from the 
rocky bed of the lake which about 140 feet at its deepest point 
the 64squaremile sea of galilee is about 700 feet below sea 
level and is israels major source of fresh water providing nearly 
onethird of the nations supply 
salt levels are now at an acceptable level but might increase if 
water levels drop because of scant rainfall berman said 
data collected by the submarines could help scientists lower the 
lakes salt levels by determining what activates the salt wells 
nobody understands the mechanisms whereby these salt sources 
begin to flow berman said 
scientists also got a closer look at a threefoothigh ridge on 
the lakes bottom indicating recent earthquake activity the sea 
of galilee is part of an active rift valley extending from the 
jordan valley and the dead sea to the red sea in the south 
the 15member crew of the control boat spent one day during the 
twoweek project looking for what they might find from the lake 
battle in 67 ad said shelley wachsmann inspector for underwater 
antiquities in the israel department of antiquities and museums 
the battle took place during the roman conquest of galilee when 
the romans overran the town of migdal on the western shore of the 
lake jews fled in boats the romans pursued them in hastily 
constructed rafts and killed about 6700 in the battle 
one could see the whole lake stained with blood and crammed 
with corpses for not one man escaped wrote the jewish historian 
and soldier flavius josephus who took part in the battle 
wachsmann said the submarines probed several areas in the 
northern part of the lake where initial research indicated boats 
from the battle might have sunk 
the submarines came up with nothing but wachsmann said they 
would be useful tools in future research 
the submarine project is part of a us national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration longterm study comparing large lakes 
around the world including lake victoria and lake malawi in africa 
and the great lakes in the united states 
the submarines are going back to the united states when the 
project ends but the scientists will return next year for further 
studies berman said

corporations from florida to california are 
plunging into the political arena to lobby for sweeping changes in 
public education and sometimes even the tax increases to pay for 
them 
the feelgood era is over say those leading the charge it is 
no longer enough to pledge jobs hold career days provide mentors 
or adopt a school 
weve learned to say no to the altruistic warm fuzzy 
stuff were not going to do that says john cairns a lawyer and 
former director of the minnesota business partnership inc it 
doesnt accomplish enough it doesnt represent enough change in 
the system it doesnt return enough on the investment were being 
asked to make 
the new types of activism range from cairns minnesota 
coalition which helped push through the state legislature a 
pioneering statewide choice program giving parents a say in 
where their children attend school to a chicago business group 
instrumental in winning state legislative approval for radical 
changes in their citys school system 
they include business campaigns for education tax increases and 
bond issues in new orleans cincinnati miami south carolina and 
california and a successful drive to remove school board members 
in detroit theres also the georgia alliance for public education 
which is convening 200 ceos from around the state in june to talk 
about education and business and politics and the boston compact 
which started by offering job placements in exchange for school 
improvements but has evolved into a citywide restructuring plan 
there certainly are more and more examples of the business 
community getting involved in some of the tougher political issues 
confronting schools says michael usdan president of the 
private nonprofit institute for educational leadership which is 
examining trends in the relationship between education and business 
theres a tendency now to move into the political arena away 
from the tiny programs that collectively may not have meant 
much at a time when the whole enterprise was facing such terrible 
terrible problems usdan said 
personalized corporate involvement in schools became highly 
visible in 1981 when new york philanthropist eugene lang 
adopted a class of sixthgraders at his alma mater promising 
them counseling support and college scholarships if they went on 
to graduate 
another boost came in 1983 after the release of a nation at 
risk the gloomy report that detailed profound shortcomings in 
us education 
from 1983 to 1987 the education department reports the number 
of education partnerships in public schools rocketed from 42200 to 
140800 more than half of them sponsored by businesses 
but the department also found that the most frequent types of 
support provided by education partnerships were special awards 
scholarships or incentives for students and guest speakers 
special demonstrations or use of the partners facilities or 
equipment the offerings suggest some of the limitations inherent 
in the approach 
some of those involved with adoptaschool programs speak 
bluntly about the problems 
some corporations may consider this the least expensive way to 
satisfy their obligation its far more difficult to run a 
complex jobs placement program where there are quid pro quos with 
the school system says gene cartwright community affairs 
manager for the amoco corp which was heavily involved in this 
years successful drive to revamp chicagos schools 
cartwright and others also noted that adopting schools the most 
popular form of partnership often means adopting survivors not 
those students most at risk 
basically most of the businesses dont want to deal with the 
more difficult students says sandra hamburg of the committee for 
economic development a group of business executives and educators 
that has issued influential reports on the need to invest in 
disadvantaged children they only want the best students to come 
in to their business for a career day program or they dont want to 
deal with pairing a company employee with someone whos not really 
motivated 
the national alliance of business a nonprofit group financed 
half by the federal government and half by the private sector has 
undertaken a major effort to widen and deepen business impact by 
sponsoring programs modeled on the boston compact in 12 cities 
across the country the premise is that local businesses pledge 
jobs to high school graduates in exchange for school improvements 
such as a reduction in the dropout rate 
however the boston compact achieved mixed results in its first 
five years and a private evaluation of the first 18 months of the 
nab project in seven cities found the same uneven pattern 
the best evidence we have points to the usefulness of these 
compacts in the areas of targeted jobs scholarships and 
modestlyscaled collaborative programming for atrisk youth 
wrote gary walker of publicprivate ventures the philadelphia firm 
that did the february 1989 evaluation 
the elusive element of these systemwide collaborations 
however continues to be the very thing that underlies their 
origination and continuing popularity school improvement 
walker wrote schoolbusiness compacts may be no more than one 
important piece of a much larger puzzle 
that view came through strongly at an nab conference last week 
among business officials involved in the political arena 
cartwright called compacts a natural and reasonable entry point 
for business to interact with the schools but added dont 
assume that they alone will remodel the infrastructure of a failing 
school system 
cartwright and cairns participants in a panel on state action 
contended that businesses can significantly influence education 
only by becoming active in the state legislative process because 
most education funds come from states 
if youre not a player with the state on many of these 
programs youre really not playing where most of the decisions are 
made cairns said 
some supporters of the compact concept disagreed a lot of 
change in large city systems is going to happen in cities 
themselves said jim vollman executive director of the detroit 
compact they are managed by local elected boards and if they 
dont buy it its not going to happen you cant expect the state 
to do it 
but even the compacts are finding they must get involved in 
politics school board or city council to win real change in 
boston for example businesses were highly successful at placing 
high school graduates in jobs but test scores improved only 
slightly and dropout rates proved intransigent in the compacts 
second phase business leaders are working with the mayor elected 
education officials and teacher unions to achieve specific reforms 
schoolbased management and a school choice program 
the common ground among forwardthinking business leaders is 
that whether their playing field is a city a state or a district 
they must move beyond a oneschool approach 
adoptaschool served a very important historical role 
says eve hoffman president of the georgia alliance a nonprofit 
group formed to educate and activate the business community on 
education issues there are a lot of people who have a lot 
invested in adoptaschool and what we have to do is encourage 
these people to look beyond that at bigger issues

many japanese workers transferring to 
their companies us branches have a problem american schools 
dont prepare their children for the tough competition to get into 
a japanese university 
japans solution and a testament to the growing japanese 
presence in this country is tennessee meiji gakuin high school 
which will be the first fully accredited japanese high school in 
america when it opens may 10 
our goal is to give education to the children of overseas 
assigned business people though the first class of 25 includes 
only one student whose family lives in the united states said 
director hiroshi jo 
although we said it will be for americanbased people it will 
be two to four years before we have enough enrollment to operate 
that way jo said he said families in japan may have been more 
familiar with the parent school meiji gakuin university than 
workers already in the united states 
nothing is more important to japanese families than the 
education of their children said former gov lamar alexander 
president of the university of tennessee and scheduled keynote 
speaker for the opening college entrance is very competitive and 
determined almost exclusively by results 
if they fall behind while theyre in the us that is a very 
dramatic problem for a japanese family 
owned and operated by the tokyo university with the support of 
japans ministry of education the coed school will open with 
grades 10 11 and 12 on the japanese school year april through 
march with 250 days of class 
school was to start saturday but students and teachers ran into 
problems getting visas jo said i think maybe because this is 
the first japanese high school immigration officials are 
carefully handling reviewing this matter 
sending a student to tmg as its called will cost about 
19000 a year 
it may be more expensive than some can afford but many send 
kids to colleges that are quite expensive jo said i also 
think some companies will begin to subsidize overseas education 
that need is more and more confirmed by both the people of japan 
and the government 
the academic life will be pretty restrictive he said they 
will have to check out of the dorms if they want to leave and they 
will have a lot of study requirements that will take a lot of their 
time 
but the students expected to number around 200 within two 
years will be encouraged to take advantage of being in another 
country they will go to class six days a week as in japan but 
the sixth day will be for outside activities 
the students will certainly have a lot of contact with the 
community jo said the students can do regular high school 
studies plus have such a valuable experience as living in this 
country 
for sweetwater a town of 5310 between knoxville and 
chattanooga it could be sort of a stayathome cultural exchange 
program 
it will be a culture shock both ways for the japanese coming 
here and for the community their philosophies of education and 
living are different so i think it will be an educational 
experience for all of us said sweetwater chamber of commerce 
president charles chamberlain 
meiji gakuin paid 24 million for 144 rolling acres and 13 
buildings including two gymnasiums a library and three 
dormitories that can house a total of 220 students it spent 15 
million on renovation 
tmg recruited in japan and hired 12 teachers four of whom two 
single people and a married couple will live on campus the 
teachers will be paid what their counterparts in japan are paid 
there were many applications for every subject jo said 
alexander who as governor from 19791987 heavily recruited 
japanese businesses said the school could be a magnet for 
industry and i think it will be a wonderful thing for our own 
educational system because it will give us a basis for comparison 
i think its healthy to have it means we dont have to go half way 
around the world to discover what the competition is doing 
there are 71 japaneseowned businesses in tennessee employing 
12600 the largest is the nissan truck plant in smyrna others 
include acom which makes panasonic electric components in 
knoxville sharp matsushita and komatsu 
tmg will employ 12 people from sweetwater and the surrounding 
area eight of them fulltime including two cooks 
they are in america jo said so they should eat some 
american food spaghetti cheeseburgers

question how do you contain 10 million gallons of oil 
answer you keep it in a tanker 
a joke making the rounds in valdez 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the three weeks since the nations 
biggest oil spill gushed from the hull of the exxon valdez 
millions of dollars thousands of manhours and tons of the most 
advanced equipment have been marshaled against the black tide in 
prince william sound 
dozens of skimming vessels more than a million feet of 
containment boom and uncounted quantities of oil suckers soakers 
and squeegees have been committed to the fight 
but despite the money manpower and machines the effort has 
scarcely dented the spill and the damage it has wrought by friday 
exxon estimated it had recovered only about 20000 of the 240000 
barrels spilled 
while plenty of blame can be shared among exxon and government 
officials for the accident and the chaos that followed those 
familiar with the science of oil spills say the enormity of 10 
million gallons of crude unleashed on the vast alaskan wilderness 
overpowered the available technology 
imagine the spill is the size of madison square garden said 
todd nelson a coast guard petty officer who specializes in oil 
spills throw a bandaid on it and thats all your containment 
boom throw a paperclip on it and thats all your skimming 
capacity the dimensions are mindboggling 
the first line of defense in an oil spill is the containment 
boom a cylindrical inflated float up to 4 feet in diameter that 
can have an attached skirt extending several feet under water 
anchors or boats hold the boom in place 
the 11hour delay in getting booms around the stricken tanker 
doomed chances of controlling the spill which eventually scattered 
over hundreds of square miles of islands inlets and bays by wind 
and waves 
its like trying to get the toothpaste back into the tube 
said nelson 
the next method considered was chemical dispersants sprayed 
from the air dispersants break up the molecular bond of oil much 
the way kitchen detergent scatters the grease in a sinkful of dirty 
dishes the tiny droplets sink to the bottom where critics say the 
oil particles will contaminate the environment for years 
but the use of dispersants has been opposed by biologists who 
fear their toxicity and there is also doubt about their success 
they must be applied under ideal conditions of moderate wave 
action and they wont work if sprayed too fine or too thick 
there have been many dispersant applications that have been 
inconclusive and a lot that just didnt work said john robinson 
chief of the hazardous materials response branch of the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration 
but there was never a chance to use them here exxon had only 
3000 gallons of chemical on hand at the time of the spill and it 
would have taken 500000 gallons to do the job in addition seas 
were either too calm or too rough in the days following the wreck 
the next possibility was to recover the oil a process involving 
a wide range of options from huge vessels to hightech mops 
the workhorse of the task is the oil skimmer an openmouthed 
boat or barge that sluices oil up a conveyer belt where it is then 
scraped or vacuumed into a holding tank 
also in the arsenal are super suckers trucks on floating 
barges that gulp oil off the surface a variety of materials can 
also sponge oil from the water 
in the exxon valdez spill the skimming operations were slow to 
start and have been frustratingly small in impact almost twice as 
much oil has disappeared through evaporation as has been picked up 
whatever success the recovery operation enjoyed is being 
credited to local fishermen who encircled the oil with booms in 
much the same way they use nets to trap herring and salmon 
experts say the continued snails pace of recovery is to be 
expected few skimmers can gather more than 40 barrels of oil over 
a few hours the nearfreezing temperature of water in the sound 
turns the oil into a squishy puddinglike consistency hard to 
collect once the skimmers are full the oily water in their holds 
must be pumped into a barge or floating tanks 
while the skimmers have struggled to collect a thousand barrels 
a day much more of the slick has been broken up by wind and wave 
action 
skimmers are a very inefficient method of recovering the oil 
they take in a lot of water with the oil said john whitney a 
science support coordinator for noaa its a very slow process 
while nature works very strongly 
the final battle against the spill is being fought on the island 
shorelines crews are trying to remove the oil from the shore 
often wiping or scraping it off rock by rock a process known 
derisively as rock waxing 
the process requires lots of people with lots of time other 
solutions like the use of highpressure hoses spewing hot water 
have been turned down as too harmful to the ecosystems on the 
beaches 
weve seen from other spills that if we hit it too hard with 
things like steam cleaning well kill everything there said 
robinson 
ed owens an exxon consultant on shoreline cleaning said 
workers will be washing down the beaches with sea water from 
lowpressure hoses 
the water washes the oil and carries it into the water where 
it is contained and then removed he said it is the least 
damaging ecologically 
while the weeks following the exxon valdez accident were marked 
by mistakes and technical problems oil spill experts says it is 
simply a very tough job to contain and recover millions of gallons 
of oil from the water 
the situation here weve seen here is not atypical robinson 
said but it doesnt relieve anybody of the responsibility of 
trying to get it done

can a romance magazine publisher find happiness 
cranking out a weekly supermarket tabloid full of celebrities and 
gossip 
national enquirer readers may soon find out 
macfadden holdings inc whose titles include true story true 
confessions and modern romance said thursday it has agreed to pay 
4125 million for the company that publishes the national 
enquirer the saucy scandal sheet put on the auction block nearly 
four months ago 
macfadden said it had formed a partnership that made the winning 
bid for gp group inc which publishes the enquirer from lantana 
fla 
the definitive sales agreement caps an auction process launched 
in middecember after the october death of generoso pope jr who 
owned gp group 
macfadden officials said the deal could be completed in may 
it sounds like a good solid price said john reidy a media 
industry analyst for the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
but he noted there was little financial information available 
publicly about either gp group or macfadden because they are both 
privately held 
some of the biggest names in the media business including 
british publisher robert maxwell frances hachette sa and west 
german publisher heinrich bauer were reportedly among the bidders 
at one time or another 
reidy said he suspected however that macfadden felt its 
properties could benefit from a link to the enquirers supermarket 
distribution system 
in a statement announcing the agreement late thursday macfadden 
said it had formed a partnership to make the bid with media 
investment fund boston ventures limited partnerhip iii which is 
financing the purchase 
macfadden will have responsibility for operating gp groups 
holdings which include the enquirers sister publication weekly 
world news 
the national enquirer has an average paid circulation of about 
43 million per week while the circulation of weekly world news is 
about 1 million 
the two publications offer considerable advertising power and an 
attractive franchise in the supermarket checkout lanes 
we are delighted we are the successful bidder for the gp 
group said peter callahan chairman of macfadden 
we have great respect for all of the employees who have helped 
build the company we are enthusiastic about the companys 
management and its prospects he said 
iain calder chairman and president of gp group said the 
entire gp group family welcomes this opportunity we will have with 
the new owners and are pleased with their commitment to us and 
their desire to continue to build and grow the company 
the blackstone group a private new york investment bank was 
retained last december to conduct the auction one of blackstones 
partners peter g peterson was one of three trustees for popes 
estate 
peterson could not be reached for comment and the firm declined 
to comment on how many bidders actually participated 
but it was understood that the auction was conducted in two 
phases with the first cut in potential candidates coming about two 
months ago the deadline for final bids was wednesday and the 
decision on a winner was completed thursday 
michael boylan macfaddens president said he and callahan met 
with gp group employees thursday in florida and told them they 
considered the employees as among the most valued assets of the 
company 
he said that while there may be some changes in how the 
publications are marketed the prospective new owners dont plan to 
change their operations gp groups headquarters will remain in 
lantana he said 
macfadden was founded in 1975 when callahan acquired several 
unprofitable romance publications for an investment of 800 
today macfadden publishes a group of seven romance magazines 
with a combined monthly circulation of about 2 million led by true 
story at 13 million boylan said 
in addition macfadden publishes teen beat magazine with a 
circulation of 250000 a month and two special interest magazines

traditional academic openness is going by the 
boards in the race to understand cold nuclear fusion as scholars 
withhold findings that could make them big money 
a broad patent on cold nuclear fusion could be worth billions of 
dollars if the invention turns out to provide a new way of 
producing cheap clean and abundant energy 
but the lure of money is inhibiting exploration of cold fusion 
claims by making researchers withhold information to protect their 
patent positions lawyers and scholars said thursday 
there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that once you dangle 
out that pot of gold called a patent it causes people to publish 
less and disclose less said donald chisum a patent expert at 
the university of washington 
scientists trying to test the cold fusion claims announced at a 
press conference last month have been stymied because the two 
researchers have withheld important details of their work 
the university of utah applied for three patents even before the 
march 23 news conference featuring its own b stanley pons and his 
coinvestigator martin fleischmann of the university of 
southampton in england 
massachusetts institute of technology said this week it has 
applied for patents on work done by a researcher named peter 
hagelstein 
brigham young university plans to apply for patents as well 
although mainly to establish the credibility of its researcher 
steven jones rather than to make money spokesman paul richards 
said 
pons and fleischmann announced they had achieved fusion using 
ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature socalled cold 
fusion they said their device produced four watts of energy for 
every watt it used 
previously it was believed that fusion would have to take place 
at extremely high temperatures the announcement stunned scientists 
worldwide who had worked for years to achieve fusion 
widespread skepticism about their findings has continued despite 
partial confirmation by other researchers still the stakes are so 
high that virtually every major chemical research laboratory is 
believed to be looking into it 
its almost unknowable unthinkable how much it would be 
worth said john bockris a chemistry professor at texas aampm 
bockris also said he was upset by the way the focus on patents 
had disrupted the normal scientific disclosure process 
patent lawyers usually advise clients to file for patents before 
they disclose anything publicly secrecy helps even after a patent 
application is filed because it gives the inventors time to modify 
their application with new findings or to file for more patents 
the more information you give out the more can be used 
against you chisum said from a patent law perspective 
publication is bad 
richards the brigham young spokesman said the school applied 
for patents mainly so the patent and trademark office has a chance 
to sort out what he called false allegations that its steven jones 
stole fleischmanns and pons work richards said brigham young did 
not believe cold fusion was likely to be very valuable commercially 
richards claimed that university of utah officials held their 
march 23 news conference despite an agreement with brigham young 
officials that the schools would keep quiet about their work until 
march 24 the day they had agreed to ship backtoback papers on 
cold fusion to the british journal nature 
richards and several patent lawyers said the university of 
utahs unusual press conference appeared to be more of a grab for 
publicity than anything 
i think they just naively thought they could pull this off 
and go down in history as the first ones to have done this 
richards said 
james brophy the university of utahs director of research 
said the school held the news conference because there had been 
leaks and i was concerned and others were concerned that the 
story would get out in an uncontrolled fashion 
any royalties from utahs patents will be split evenly three 
ways between fleischmann and pons the chemistry department and 
the university as a whole that is the usual procedure brophy said 
the concern for profit on campus accelerated in the 1970s with 
biotechnology which made a fast transition from pure research to 
product stanford university and the university of california at 
berkeley earn millions of dollars a year on the socalled 
cohenboyers atent on genesplicing techniques 
the revolution in hightemperature superconductivity dragged 
universities even closer to the commercial sphere 
superconductivity is the ability to transmit electricity through a 
substance without any loss of power or resistance 
last year for example du pont co paid 15 million to the 
university of houston for exclusive rights to paul chus 
superconductivity patent applications

the us dollar slipped against the japanese yen 
friday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange also were 
lower in morning trading 
the dollar which opened at 13200 yen down 080 yen from 
thursdays close rose slightly to 13230 yen by late morinig it 
moved in the range of 13192 to 13237 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 19251point 
loser thursday shed another 13867 points or 042 percent to 
finish the morning session at 3292527 
the decline was precipitated by a retreat in new york linked to 
the dollars weakness in currency markets said yoshiro inouye an 
analyst with nomura securities 
but participants were inclined to remain on the sidelines 
today due to concerns over the release of us economic indicators 
later friday he said 
the united states was to announce major economic figures 
including the nations trade figures for february and wholesale 
prices for march 
japanese stock investors expect the us trade deficit to widen 
to around 99 billion from 95 billion in january inouye said 
political uncertainty over a widening stock profiteering and 
bribery scandal here has chronically discouraged trading he added 
in the currency market traders said the dollar fell after 
slipping in new york to 13206 yen down 099 yen from its 13305 
yen close wednesday 
the us currency weakened following a rise in swiss interest 
rates and the appointment of a new west german finance minister 
the traders said 
nervousness over us trade figures was also discouraged trading 
in the foreign exchange market a dealer at a japanese commercial 
bank said on condition of anonymity

burlington resources inc which itself was spun 
off from burlington northern inc last year said thursday it 
intends to divest its timber and wood products operation plum 
creek timber co 
burlington resources said plum creek timber co lp a master 
limited partnership had registered with the securities and 
exchange commission for an initial public offering with proceeds 
to be used to acquire and run plum creek 
plum creek has approximately 14 million acres of timberland and 
about 96 billion board feet of salable softwood timber in the 
pacific northwest it employs about 1800 people in washington 
idaho and montana and in 1988 had a profit of 574 million on 
revenues of 3328 million 
burlington resources said the current management of plum creek 
would remain in place and that no changes in employment levels 
would result from the establishment of the partnership 
in its registration statement with the sec the partnership 
seeks an initial public offering of 1235 million depositary units 
each with a proposed maximum offering price of 2050 the units 
represent an 88 percent interest in the limited partnership 
immediately before completing the public offering the 
partnership and its 95 percentowned subsidiary plum creek 
manufacturing inc would borrow about 325 million which with 
the proceeds of the offering would be used to buy plum creek 
the combined aquisition price is expected to be about 575 
million burlington resources will keep a 12 percent interest in 
the partnership along with some of plum creeks assets 
burlington resources said its decision to divest plum creek was 
consistent with its plans to concentrate on its gas oil and 
natural gas pipeline businesses 
it said it plans to distribute at least 60 cents per unit each 
quarter and if necessary burlington resources would make cash 
payments to the partnership to support such distributions 
last year burlington northern spun off burlington resources to 
encompass burlingtons oil mineral timber and pipeline segments 
burlington northern kept the burlington northern railroad and moved 
its headquarters from seattle to fort worth texas

if the development of the atomsplitting 
fission process is any guide decades may pass before exciting new 
fusion experiments lead to the commerical production of power by 
combining atoms westinghouse electric corp officials say 
as a rule of thumb wed say its probably 20 to 30 years 
away said j robert maxwell manager of strategic programs for 
westinghouses energy business its virtually a test tube 
experiment a benchtop experiment 
from the manhattan project in the early 1940s it took until 1957 
to build the first experimental fission power plant at 
shippingport pa widespread commericial use of the process to make 
electricity took another decade 
maxwell and another top official at the nations leading 
producer of nuclear power plants say fusion also may pose 
significant radiation hazards although probably not as severe as 
those from splitting atoms in fission reactors 
fusion is not a piece of cake maxwell said if this turns 
out to be successful then well switch to fusion then well have 
to find the new demons and solve them 
nonetheless maxwell and the companys top scientist said 
reports from the university of utah georgia tech texas aampm and 
elsewhere of what appears to be a cold fusion process may bring a 
tidal shift in energy production but not anytime soon 
the three universities have not even demonstrated a theory of 
how the process works 
they have developed an experiment which suggsts there is a 
principle that can be demonstrated maxwell said probably it 
is an advance but it causes us some problems of its own that we 
have not explored 
fusion could eliminate the problem of spent radioactive fuel 
that must be sealed in storage indefinitely but fusion may have to 
take place behind heavy shielding to protect power plant employees 
and it may irradiate power plant components to the point where they 
must be handled like the radioactive scrap from todays fission 
plants he said 
westinghouse is one of about 10 companies that signed agreements 
to review the university of utahs patent applications on condition 
that the lab results remain confidential james brophy university 
vice president for research said thursday 
westinghouse will evaluate utahs patent applications while 
searching for commercial applications for its fusion experiment r 
d dee haun jr westinghouses chief scientist said wednesday 
in an interview 
its very tantalizing said haun who describes himself as 
an enthusiastic skeptic about cold fusion 
utahs chemistry department chairman b stanley pons and his 
colleague martin fleischmann of the university of southampton 
england announced march 23 that they had replicated at room 
temperature the process that powers the sun and hydrogen bombs 
amid great skepticism among scientists georgia tech and texas 
aampm said this week that their separate experiments appear to 
confirm the work of fleischmann and pons 
they passed electricity through palladium while the metal was 
immersed in heavy water which differs from regular water in that 
its hydrogen component has a heftier nucleus than the lone proton 
at the heart of a regular hydrogen atom 
the heavy hydrogen atoms bond in pairs to create a bigger atom 
that releases energy in the form of speeding neutrons as it 
deteriorates haun said 
unfortunately thats as far as classical explanations will 
get you he said wednesday 
the experiments do not precisely fit existing fusion theories 
because far fewer energybearing neutrons are being detected than 
predicted haun said 
but if this works like hightemperature fusion it could 
generate a lot of neutrons comparable to the number of neutrons in 
fission and those neutrons are going to activate the surroundings 
so youd have a waste disposal problem a shielding problem he 
said 
however the neutrons detected in the lab experiments appear to 
be roughly 10 billion times fewer than commercial fission haun 
said 
a westinghouse scientist began work march 24 trying to duplicate 
the utah experiment results so far are inconclusive he said

securities analysts say texaco inc is a 
dramatically changed company a year after emerging from bankruptcy 
and completing a major restructuring 
at a meeting with analysts thursday texaco officials said the 
company is approaching the future with optimism after recording a 
13 billion aftertax profit from the sale of texaco canada inc 
there is a kind of change from big revenues and an 
empirebuilder to a costconscious company said one securities 
official who asked that his name not be used 
texacos chief financial officer allen j krowe told the 
analyst group that the 13 billion firstquarter profit would be 
slightly offset by restructuring expenses 
texaco sold its 78 percent stake in the lucrative canadian 
subsidiary to exxon corp in january for 324 billion the deal 
was one of the final steps in a massive restructuring following the 
companys emergence from bankruptcy last april 
the company realized nearly 7 billion in total proceeds from 
the asset sales more than the company and analysts had expected 
krowe said texaco revenue would decline slightly in 1989 from 
3514 billion in 1988 reflecting divestments although revenue 
from continuing operations was expected to rise about 5 percent 
the financial officer also said texaco had reduced its debt to 
about 71 billion at the end of the first quarter from 79 
billion at the end of 1988 and expects a reduction to 65 billion 
by years end 
on another matter texaco president james w kinnear said the 
oil industry needed to strengthen its efforts to prevent another 
spill like last months disaster off the alaskan coast in which a 
grounded exxon tanker spilled about 250000 barrels of oil into 
prince william sound 
we have to redouble our efforts to be safe and to make certain 
that this in fact was only an isolated incident kinnear told 
reporters 
kinnear said he met thursday with the heads of several other 
major oil companies including exxon the largest us oil company 
for the first time to begin discussions on how to prevent a similar 
disaster and improve response time 
texacos restructuring has helped boost the companys share 
price from 38 a year ago to 5362 at thursdays close on the new 
york stock exchange 
despite the changes analysts agree that texaco still must make 
a big oil discovery if it intends to compete in the future 
although texaco is focusing more capital expenditures on 
exploration and production about 80 percent of its efforts involve 
going back into old wells using improved technology 
kinnear has delivered on many things that he said he would 
stephen smith analyst for bear stearns amp co said before the 
meeting but as far as future performance that will take time 
in april 1987 texaco filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a 
potentially ruinous multibilliondollar security bond in its fight 
with pennzoil co 
pennzoil had sued texaco claiming texacos 1984 acquisition of 
getty oil co interfered with pennzoils prior contract to buy part 
of reserverich getty 
in 1985 a houston jury awarded pennzoil a 103 billion 
judgment texaco appealed the judgment but eventually settled with 
pennzoil for 3 billion amid heavy shareholder pressure to do so

oil billionaire marvin davis has been told to 
keep his distance from northwest airlines pilots a group playing 
an important role in the takeover battle for the carrier involving 
davis and other suitors 
us district judge harry maclaughlin issued a temporary 
restraining order thursday preventing davis colorado partnership 
from disrupting current contracts or contract negotiations at 
the nations fourthlargest airline most important to northwest 
are its ongoing negotiations with the 5000member air line pilots 
association 
the mediated talks are being held to merge the separate 
contracts that existed when northwest acquired republic airlines in 
1986 the former republic and northwest pilots contracts have 
expired 
kurt rivard a securities analyst for minneapolisbased dain 
bosworth inc said it is important for northwest to keep the 
pilots happy davis or other suitors could gain leverage in their 
takeover bids by getting the pilots on their side he said 
whoever ends up owning northwest they have to be on good 
terms with the pilots and the pilots know that rivard said 
davis who has offered 262 billion or 90 a share for 
northwest said maclaughlins ruling will not affect him his bid 
has been rejected by nwa inc the parent of northwest and there 
is speculation a higher bid is on its way 
nwa stock closed thursday at 9025 down 50 cents 
since all of our past and planned communications with union 
representatives are in full compliance with the limitations 
outlined by the judge todays ruling will not have any effect on 
our future actions a spokesman for davis said in a statement 
in its lawsuit northwest contended that davis was violating the 
railway labor act by seeking information from the unions about 
contract proposals davis says his representatives have contacted 
the unions representing 34000 of northwests 38000 employees but 
only to create an open dialogue with them 
edward glennon a lawyer for davis said all nwa suitors should 
be allowed to meet with the airlines unions to dispel fears the 
unions may have about possible new owners the same principle was 
at work when peter ueberroth recently met with the unions of 
eastern airlines in a failed bid to buy that carrier glennon said 
a dispute arose thursday between northwest based in suburban 
eagan and davis over the nature of davis previous contacts with 
the unions for instance glennon denied a statement from a 
northwest staff lawyer that davis has met in person with union 
officials maclaughlin said he would not attempt to settle the 
dispute 
the temporary restraining order is good for 10 days and could be 
extended the judge said 
the ruling is limited to davis and his associates even though 
there have been reports that at least two other investment groups 
are interested in buying northwest 
one of the groups identified in newspaper reports is wesray 
capital corp a new york investment company founded by former us 
treasury secretary william simon the second is a group that 
includes gary l wilson a walt disney executive who left 
northwests board in november al checchi a los angeles 
businessman and frederick malek a former member of the nixon 
white house and campaign adviser to president bush 
three phone calls to wesray capital went unanswered thursday and 
a woman who answered the phone in checchis office would not 
comment on the report 
jim halvorson a spokesman for the pilots said thursday the 
union is some distance apart on key contract issues he said a 
negotiating subcommittee has been formed to discuss the possibility 
of creating an employee stock ownership plan analysts have said 
such a plan would help northwest defend itself against a takeover 
by putting more stock in friendly hands 
meanwhile northwest is facing lawsuits from dissident 
shareholders and davis that seek to invalidate the companys 
poison pill antitakeover plan a hearing on davis lawsuit is 
scheduled for april 24 in the court of chancery in wilmington

twoweekold incentives apparently drew some car 
buyers into showrooms in early april when vehicle sales soared 
283 percent over last year but some in the industry wondered if 
car sales really are rebounding 
automakers who reported their april 110 sales figures thursday 
have been banking on strong results to put off speculation that 
largescale production cuts may be down the road 
the eight companies that make cars and trucks in the united 
states said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 36967 
during early april compared with a 28811vehicleaday rate 
during the same time last year 
car sales shot up 301 percent and truck sales were up 252 
percent over last years levels 
automakers and some analysts said the results were positive 
signs that the industry was back on track 
these sales look pretty strong said analyst scott merlis of 
morgan stanley amp co of new york it represents a normal and 
healthy response to the latest round in sales incentives 
our dealers tell us there is strong consumer interest in and 
floor traffic from our new incentive program robert rewey vice 
president for ford motor cos north american sales operations 
said in a statement 
but spot checks by the associated press late wednesday and 
thursday of dealers in ohio louisiana connecticut washington 
illinois and arizona showed no consumer rush to buy new cars 
i think people are washed up with incentives said sales 
manager mark baudean of sewell cadillacchevrolet in new orleans 
march and april typically are big months for automakers as 
americans prepare for summer vacations and weekend road trips but 
sales during march and the entire first quarter of 1989 were lower 
than expected meantime ambitious production schedules continued 
and inventories rose leading to speculation that without a sales 
boost summertime production cuts and layoffs are growing 
possibilities 
all that led to the latest round of buyer enticements which 
included cutrate financing and bigger cash rebates on more cars 
and trucks 
on march 29 ford opened the gates by offering 29 percent 
financing for twoyear loans along with the rebates 
general motors corp matched the offer a day later and on april 
3 chrysler corp undercut its competitors by offering 
interestfree financing on twoyear deals 
while detroit is likely to put a brave face on this sales 
report management has to be disappointed said analyst ron 
glantz of montgomery securities inc in san francisco some sales 
have been deferred from late march and sales are normally 
strongest in the first two selling periods after a major increase 
in incentives 
tom webb a senior economist for the national automobile dealers 
association in mclain va said it appeared the gain was due more 
to the weak period last year than a strong period this year 
big incentives last year expired at the end of march consumers 
attracted by them pushed their buying plans into march in effect 
borrowing sales from later months 
this year the situation was reversed anticipation of big 
incentives began growing in march prompting some car buyers to 
delay purchase plans until they were announced 
despite the increase in early april numbers car and truck sales 
through april 10 this year were running 5 percent behind last year 
the secondbest in the industrys history for months company 
executives and analysts have been predicting that sales in 1989 
would be lower than 1988 
car sales for the year so far were down 71 percent and truck 
sales were off 11 percent 
merlis of morgan stanley predicted that mid and lateapril 
sales figures may not be as strong as the ones reported thursday 
but it will still be a scenario that it was much better than 
generally expected he said

burlington resources inc which itself was spun 
off from burlington northern inc last year says it plans to 
divest its timber and wood products operation plum creek timber co 
burlington resources said plum creek timber co lp a master 
limited partnership registered with the securities and exchange 
commission for an initial public offering with proceeds to be used 
to acquire and run plum creek 
plum creek has approximately 14 million acres of timberland and 
about 96 billion board feet of salable softwood timber in the 
pacific northwest it employs about 1800 people in washington 
idaho and montana and in 1988 had profits of 574 million on 
revenues of 3328 million 
in a news release thursday burlington resources said the 
current management of plum creek would remain in place and that no 
changes in employment levels would result from the establishment of 
the partnership 
in its registration statement with the sec the partnership 
seeks an initial public offering of 1235 million depositary units 
each with a proposed maximum offering price of 2050 the units 
represent an 88 percent interest in the limited partnership 
the combined acquisition price is expected to be about 575 
million 
immediately before completing the public offering the 
partnership and its 95 percentowned subsidiary plum creek 
manufacturing inc would borrow about 325 million which with 
the proceeds of the offering would be used to buy plum creek 
burlington resources will keep a 12 percent interest in the 
partnership along with some of plum creeks existing assets 
burlington resources said its decision to divest plum creek was 
consistent with its plans to concentrate on its gas oil and 
natural gas pipeline businesses 
last year burlington northern spun off burlington resources as 
a separate company encompassing burlingtons oil mineral timber 
and pipeline segments burlington northern kept the burlington 
northern railroad 
for 1988 burlington resources had net income of 721 million 
or 46 cents a share on revenues of 217 billion

wholesale prices despite a big jump in home 
heating oil costs rose a moderate 04 percent in march as 
inflation eased somewhat after steep increases of 1 percent in each 
of the previous two months the government said today 
the boost in the labor departments producer price index 
reflected higher costs for both food and energy although the 
increases in both categories were smaller than those registered in 
the first two months of the year 
the overall gain was close to analysts expectations and helped 
calm wall streets inflation fears causing a sharp rally in early 
trading today 
the stock market staged a sharp rally encouraged by the 
apparent easing of inflationary pressures the dow jones average of 
30 industrials climbed 2145 to 231745 in the first half hour of 
trading 
while marchs increase was much more restrained than the strong 
jumps of the previous two months wholesale prices one stop short 
of retail have risen at a compound annual rate of 102 percent over 
the past three months 
that is the largest quarterly increase since prices rose at a 
compound annual rate of 132 percent during the first three months 
of 1981 
should the first quarters rate be sustained for the rest of the 
year it would far exceed the increase registered for 1988 when 
wholesale prices rose 4 percent in what was the steepest gain in 
seven years prices had risen 22 percent in 1987 
financial markets had been fearful that further bad news on the 
inflation front would prompt the federal reserve board to step up 
its campaign to slow economic growth and restrain inflationary 
pressures by pushing up interest rates 
dirk van dongen president of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors said the latest report was good news but 
doesnt totally put to rest worries about accelerating inflation 
i dont think at all that this suggests that the inflation 
watch should be terminated he said i dont think this battle 
is over 
wholesale food prices rose 08 percent last month after jumping 
12 percent during february last months increase in food costs 
was led by a 388 percent gain in prices for eggs while vegetable 
costs dropped 116 percent after surging 353 percent during 
february 
energy prices meanwhile rose 09 percent in march following a 
24 percent increase during the previous month last months 
increase was led by a 168 percent rise in home heating oil prices 
while gasoline costs rose 35 percent and natural gas prices 
declined 54 percent 
excluding the volatile food and energy categories prices rose 
03 percent in march down from a 06 percent increase a month 
earlier 
the overall march increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1122 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11220 last month 
that was up 50 cents from february and 56 percent above march 
1988 
the troubling inflation reports at the start of 1989 had come 
even as signs emerge that the economy is cooling off in response to 
the feds antiinflation campaign 
three other government reports released today added to growing 
evidence that the economy is slowing down 
the us merchandise trade deficit swelled by 209 percent to 
105 billion in february as americans increased their appetite for 
foreign goods the commerce department reported 
the operating rate for us factories declined for the second 
consecutive month in march to 84 percent the first backtoback 
declines in nearly three years the federal reserve board said 
business inventories rose 05 percent in february while sales 
plunged 09 percent the steepest decline in more than two years 
commerce reported 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said in advance 
of todays reports that while the economy does seem to be losing 
steam it may take awhile for that to translate into inflation 
relief 
there is a tendency to expect inflation to weaken as soon as 
the economy starts to slow but more often than not it doesnt 
happen that way sinai said more often than not it takes a 
weak economy for quite some time before inflation begins to peak 
and then drop 
despite the moderate price hikes last month for finished goods 
such as bread and clothing the index for prices at earlier stages 
of production demonstrated stronger inflation 
prices at the intermediate level for items such as flour and 
cloth rose 07 percent while the cost of crude goods such as 
cotton and wheat was up 23 percent 
marchs figures on increases in consumer prices which so far 
this year have been smaller than those at the wholesale level will 
be released on tuesday the consumer price index rose 04 percent 
in february and 06 percent in january 
sinai and many others are forecasting a mild recession by the 
first half of 1990 but other analysts still are hopeful that the 
fed can slow the economy just enough to restrain inflation and 
produce a soft landing in which growth slows but the economy 
avoids an outright downturn

the banking industry may have a staid image but 
recent times have demonstrated that investing in bank stocks can be 
a real adventure 
consider what has happened with bankamerica corp which 
operates the third largest bank in the country 
after trading close to 30 all through the late 1970s and early 
1980s it embarked on a long slide to just above 5 in late 1987 as 
losses mounted and the company stopped paying dividends 
since that time as bankamerica has straightened out some of its 
problems and returned to profitability the shares have soared back 
to a recent high of 25 the first dividend since 1985 was paid in 
march 
bankamerica may be an extreme example but stocks of other large 
money center banks as opposed to regional or local 
institutions also have had their share of ups and downs of late 
in recent weeks the emphasis has been on the ups thanks to 
widespread hopes that the earnings outlook for most banks will 
improve under the bush administrations new plan for dealing with 
the debt problems of third world countries 
new yorkbased citicorp for example has racked up a gain of 
some 66 percent since early 1988 climbing from 18 to a shade 
above 30 
over the same span chase manhattan has risen from around 21 to 
past 35 for a similar percentage gain manufacturers hanover has 
rallied from around 19 to the mid30s 
the recent sharp rise in the group underscores the great 
volatility of these stocks says chris kotowski an analyst at 
oppenheimer amp co in a current report on the industry 
while the debt problems of lesserdeveloped countries have been 
a touchy issue for a long time and banks are in the center of a 
stormy interestrate environment kotowski says he doesnt believe 
it is just news in itself that makes the big bank stocks so jumpy 
instead he says we believe the volatility is caused in 
large part by the very narrowly based institutional ownership of 
these shares 
the 25 investing institutions that represent the biggest owners 
by themselves hold 28 percent of all the shares of the six major 
moneycenter banks kotowski notes 
this narrow base of ownership in our opinion accentuates all 
major moves in the group both positive and negative 
in rally phases such as the present one most institutions 
not among the 25 major moneycenter bank stock owners discover that 
they are substantially underweighted in the group and then rush in 
to the stocks in fear of missing a great historical move 
in downward moves the slide can be very sharp because most 
institutions do not like to own the stocks and those that do 
already own very high concentrations in the group 
the pattern has been evident for some time kotowski observed 
in 1987 after citicorp took the dramatic step of setting aside a 
big reserve against its loans to lesserdeveloped countries 
moneycenter bank stocks jumped 20 percent to 25 percent in six 
weeks 
that rally subsequently collapsed leaving the group with a net 
loss of 35 percent for all of 1987 true there was a market crash 
that autumn but measures of bluechip industrial stocks still 
finished the year showing a small overall gain 
it may be that venturesome investors in this group will benefit 
handsomely in the future from some ultimate resolution of the third 
world debt snarl alternatively speculators may find themselves in 
for a long wait 
either way however the record of the past several years makes 
it plain that money in bank stocks is very different from money in 
the bank

president bush and congressional leaders 
announced today a nearly 28 billion deficitreduction plan that 
bush said would be a first manageable step toward stemming the 
tide of red ink 
the agreement thrashed out in more than a month of talks that 
concluded late thursday night minimally meets next years goal of 
reducing the deficit to 100 billion while putting off the tough 
choices until later 
it allows the president to claim he wont violate his campaign 
pledge against new taxes and he agreed to lower his defense 
spending plans so that congress could avert a squeeze on popular 
domestic programs 
the budget agreement does not complete the whole 
deficitreduction job but i am convinced that we will only be 
able to complete that job if we tackle it in manageable steps on an 
orderly basis in a constructive bipartisan spirit bush said 
and this is a first manageable step 
this is not an heroic agreement said house speaker jim 
wright dtexas if we begin with the assumption that there can 
be no significant major increase in revenue this agreement is 
about as good as we could do 
no one should be deluded into thinking that this is the end of 
the process said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine much sterner measures will be required in the future 
bush and the house and senate leadership sealed the deal in a 
morning meeting in the cabinet room and then announced it at a 
rose garden ceremony 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the chairman of the senate finance 
committee attended the meeting with the president but refused to 
join in the announcement 
he declined to go out in the rose garden and have his picture 
taken because he doesnt like the agreement said jack devore 
bentsens spokesman 
the senator told the president that he thought the budget was 
marginal that hes concerned that it depends on wildly optimistic 
economic assumptions and there remains a great gulf between the 
congress and the administration on how you raise the 53 billion 
in new taxes bush is calling for devore said 
the plan claims to reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit to about 994 
billion meeting the goal of the grammrudman law of a deficit no 
larger than 100 billion in the year beginning oct 1 
the deficit next year would be about 1266 billion under 
current government policies compared with about 163 billion this 
fiscal year according to administration estimates 
about half of the deficit reduction 142 billion would come 
from a combination of increased revenues including 58 billion in 
taxes 27 billion in fees for government services and 57 
billion from selling government assets according to sources 
familiar with the package 
details of the revenue sources were left unspecified to be 
worked out later as congress and its committees draft the 
legislation to implement the pact the budget agreement itself does 
not have the force of law but it will provide a framework for the 
actual spending bills passed later 
the tax figure includes 500 million through increased 
enforcement of the tax code but achieving the other 53 billion 
will either mean finding taxes that bush doesnt believe violate 
his campaign pledges or congress acceding to bushs claim that 
cutting the capital gains tax rate will bring in more revenue not 
less 
bush wants a lower capital gains tax and says it would actually 
increase revenue in fiscal 1990 because of an increase in that type 
of financial activity democrats argue that the plan is a big 
revenue loser in the long run with the wealthy sopping up most of 
the benefits 
on the spending side the plan would restrain overall growth for 
fiscal 1990 in both domestic and military programs to below the 
rate of inflation 
the pentagon would be held to about 299 billion in outlays 
virtually the same as this year military spending authority which 
includes commitments that span more than one fiscal year would be 
about 3055 billion 
current cost controls in the medicare health plan would be 
extended and other restraints would be imposed on that fastgrowing 
entitlement without cutting benefits overall spending by 
government agencies would be increased with the rate of inflation 
although the congress and bush would presumably cut some programs 
to make room for additional spending in others 
even before the agreement was announced negotiators were saying 
that more needed to be done especially if the deficit path is to 
continue downward and reach the 64 billion goal for fiscal 1991 
deep spending cuts or significant tax increases would be needed to 
meet that goal the negotiators concluded and they decided against 
tackling it in the current round of talks 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on the house 
budget committee called the result something of a 
disappointment 
it does not make substantial reductions in our spending 
although it slows the upward trend it isnt what i had hoped 
for he said 
its going to make the work for next year very difficult he 
said 
a big chunk of the deficit plan is made up of oneshot savings 
and accounting gimmicks that dont lessen the longterm deficit 
problem 
sales of government assets which are frequently loan 
portfolios often cost the treasury in the long run 
the plan lists 19 billion in savings from reduced payments to 
farmers but more than half of that would be by paying farmers 
early so the checks are written this fiscal year instead of next 
more than 3 billion of the other savings in the plan come from 
accounting changes such as moving the postal service off 
budget 
the plan also claims that by rejecting its pay raise earlier 
this year congress saved 100 million 
more than 1 billion of the deficit reduction is calculated 
because the government would pay less interest because of the 
savings in the rest of the plan 
although the plan claims to reduce the deficit to slightly below 
the 100 billion grammrudman ceiling the law does not count the 
57 billion in asset sales toward that target 
the plan also relies on administration economic assumptions 
which are widely regarded as too optimistic if the economy does 
not meet those expectations of strong growth and low interest 
rates the real deficit will exceed the one calculated in advance 
for the purposes of the grammrudman law 
if congress and the president fail to enact spending and tax 
bills that at least on paper bring the deficit to within 10 
billion of grammrudmans 100 billion target the law requires the 
administration to cut military and domestic spending across the 
board only social security and welfare programs are exempt from 
such cuts

the head of the coast guard acting on 
stern orders from president bush has given exxon until saturday to 
produce a cleanup plan for the nations largest oil spill 
as the remainder of the oil slick from the exxon valdez 
continued to break up attention turned to the long task of 
cleaning up prince william sound one of the worlds most 
untarnished waterways until the supertanker ran aground 
exxon announced thursday that it would make a 15 million down 
payment on a fund for studies of the impact of the spill and 
federal investigators announced hearings next month into the cause 
of the disaster 
coast guard commandant paul yost set the deadline for the oil 
companys cleanup plan including details on the number of workers 
equipment and logistics after he arrived thursday to take charge 
of the operation 
it had been feared that oil might move around gore point 
southwest of prince william sound and north into cook inlet where 
a lucrative halibut fishery is scheduled to open in a month but it 
appeared today that choppy seas were continuing to disperse the 
spill churning parts of it into a chocolatemousselike substance 
its mostly due to the weather its breaking up coast 
guard chief petty officer roy compton said this morning theyre 
seeing patches of sheen and a little bit of mousse in the gore 
point area 
compton said damage was still not completely assessed on the 
exxon valdez which was nestled in a cove on oilblackened naked 
island repairs were under way but its going to be a while 
before theyre all finished he said 
yost indicated that he believed the company already a week late 
in meeting a similar deadline set by the state would now produce 
the plan 
but he described the magnitude of the 101 milliongallon spill 
as overwhelming 
theres not a contingency plan whether its san francisco 
bay whether its new york harbor whether its puget sound 
theres not a contingency plan that exists that would have 
addressed a spill of 10 million gallons yost said 
the coast guard has been given final authority over the cleanup 
of the oil that poured from the tanker which veered sharply out of 
shipping lanes march 24 and slammed into a treacherous reef 
yost said president bush sent him to take personal oversight 
of the coordination of this cleanup that exxons doing 
things are getting better and were going to do everything we 
can to expedite the cleanup yost said after flying over the area 
yost said he considers his relationship with the oil company to 
be adversarial 
i have some marching orders from the president of the united 
states and it means it is not a happy or cozy relationship with 
exxon he said 
exxons failure to produce a plan has angered state officials 
who earlier requested a coast guard takeover of the cleanup state 
environmental chief dennis kelso said thursday he still had not 
received such a plan even though he requested one weeks ago 
jan cool an exxon spokeswoman said the company had no comments 
on yosts statements 
while the cleanup of oilsoaked beaches has just begun the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced thursday 
that exxon has contributed 15 million for the agencys cost of 
assessing the spills longterm impact interior secretary manuel 
lujan had complained wednesday that exxon was slow in making the 
payment 
noaa administrator william evans said the money was just a 
down payment for money already spent by his agency in the 
attempt to fight the spill 
thousands of sea birds and mammals have already died in the oily 
muck that washed up on beaches following the spill there are also 
fears of the oils impact on the rich fisheries of the sound 
splotchy remainders of the spill some no bigger than a table 
top meandered west of gore point and the edge of the chugach 
islands on the edge of cook inlet on thursday 
but officials attention turned to the oiled beaches where 
damage was the greatest 
kelso said the state has identified 3000 separate cleanup areas 
on islands in the sound he said 44 of those sites are now ready 
for cleanup crews 
cleanup crews were at some of the beaches on thursday shoveling 
up oil scraping rocks and using lowpressure water hoses to flush 
the oil back into the water where it was trapped and recovered 
exxonpaid cleanup workers have filled hundreds of bags a day 
with thick crude oil and gravel on naked island were doing good 
enough that every day its harder to find oil to pick up that 
means something said dean carl a wood boat refinisher from 
valdez 
as the cleanup began in earnest the national transportation 
safety board announced it will hold four days of public hearings 
beginning may 16 in anchorage to determine the probable cause of 
the accident

bond prices rebounded sharply in heavy trading 
today following several government reports suggesting an easing of 
inflationary pressures 
the treasurys bellwether 30year issue jumped 1 316 point or 
about 12 for every 1000 in face amount as its yield which 
moves inversely to price fell to 903 percent from 915 percent 
late thursday 
the labor department reported that the producer price index of 
finished goods rose 04 percent in march better than the 05 
percent many had expected the index which measures inflation at 
the wholesale level had increased 1 percent in each of the two 
previous months 
the worst fears that some market observers had expressed 
regarding the possibility of a big increase in the producer price 
index were soundly refuted said marshall b front economist at 
the chicago investment and mutualfund management firm of stein roe 
amp farnham 
the government also said the us merchandise trade deficit for 
february widened by 209 percent to 105 billion from januarys 
898 billion 
and the government reported a 02 percent decline in the 
operating rate for us factories last month to 84 percent the 
second consecutive monthly decline business inventories rose 05 
percent in february while sales plunged 09 percent in their 
steepest decline in more than two years the government said 
the reports were consistent with expectations analysts said 
and fit in with other evidence of slower growth including 
lackluster retail sales and a slackening of employment growth in 
march 
other concerns about rising inflation and the possibility of 
the fed tightening seem to be less of a reality than before these 
figures were released front said 
inflation and high interest rates erode the value of 
fixedincome securities such as bonds 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
notes were up between 1332 and 1732 point intermediate issues 
were point to 2732 point higher and longterm issues rose as 
much as 1 132 point according to telerate inc a financial 
reporting service 
the movement of a point equals a 10 change in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer jumped 694 to 112523 
in corporate trading prices also advanced moodys investment 
grade corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer rose 088 
to 30002 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile declined to 
889 while the discount fell 17 basis points to 859 percent 
yields on sixmonth bills declined to 916 percent as the discount 
also dropped 17 basis points to 867 percent yields on oneyear 
bills fell to 935 percent as the discount lost 19 basis points to 
863 percent

firstquarter profits at merrill lynch amp co 
plunged 46 percent despite a 25 percent jump in revenue as the 
nations largest brokerage continued to be plagued by a weak 
business environment 
for the period ended march 31 merrill reported net earnings of 
372 million or 31 cents a share down from 683 million or 62 
cents a share in the yearago period 
revenue during the quarter jumped to 3 billion from 24 
billion in the first quarter of 1988 primarily due to a 60 percent 
increase in interest and dividend revenue the company noted that 
exclusive of these increases however revenue increased just 5 
percent 
these results reflect the continuing weakness in the market 
environment for many of our core business activities said 
merrill chairman william a schryer 
but he noted that a strong capital base growing client assets 
diversification of businesses and gains in institutional market 
share will help merrill prosper when market conditions 
improve 
merger and acquisition advisory services and corporate bond 
underwritings boosted investment banking revenues by 10 percent to 
248 million although a decline in equity underwritings partly 
offset the gain 
asset management and custodial fee revenue rose along with 
insurance revenue and real estate revenues generated by fine homes 
international but commission revenue declined 5 percent to 417 
million because of a continued lull in stock trading volume 
principal transaction revenue also declined down 15 percent to 
348 million 
at the end of the quarter merrill reported 290 billion in

michael milken agreed today to set aside more 
than 600 million in assets and post a 1 million bond in 
connection with wideranging racketeering and fraud charges against 
the former drexel burnham lambert inc financier 
saying milken was not a threat to flee the country before an 
expected trial us district judge kimba m wood denied the 
governments request that milken post 250 million in bail money 
in addition milkens brother lowell who also faces fraud and 
racketeering charges agreed to set aside 50 million in assets in 
the face of the racketeering statutes and was ordered to post a 1 
million bond secured by other assets 
the milkens left the courthouse to applause from about 100 
supporters who attended the hearing but did not comment 
the ruling means the milkens will be free pending a trial 
prosecutors say is expected to last more than six months and should 
mark a high point in the governments nearly threeyear crackdown 
on wall street fraud 
the milkens and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg were 
charged in a 98count racketeering and fraud indictment handed up 
march 29 that seeks some 18 billion in forfeitures 
under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
act the government could have sought to freeze all of the 
defendants assets before a trial as a guarantee they wouldnt sell 
or otherwise dilute them to avoid massive penalties if convicted 
the agreement announced at a manhattan federal court hearing 
requires michael milken to place 300 million cash in an account to 
be monitored by the government and to sign a note securing 300 
million more in less liquid assets 
milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdings 
in drexel which total 6 percent of the investment firm and are 
estimated at about 100 million as soon as the firms settlement 
of separate civil charges with the securities and exchange 
commission officially takes effect 
that deal announced thursday resolves a range of separate civil 
charges against drexel and requires the wall street giant to 
dismiss milken sever all business dealings with him and force him 
to give up his drexel holdings 
in substance your honor we expect the security for 
forfeiture in this case will amount to 700 million assistant 
us attorney john k carroll said 
flanked by a group of defense lawyers milken and his brother 
attended the hearing but did not address the judge 
the defendants not only contest the indictment but they 
seriously expressly contest the governments theories on 
forfeiture said arthur l liman michael milkens attorney 
defense lawyers and prosecutors have grappled over the terms of 
the bond package since the longawaited milken indictment was 
handed up the government reportedly initially sought 1 billion in 
pretrial asset holdings 
milken who reportedly made more than 1 billion between 1983 
and 1987 under the deal also is barred from transferring any 
assets out of the country and must gradually sell assets to convert 
the 300 million note to cash milken also surrendered his passport 
carroll sought 250 million in bail claiming the potential 
racketeering forfeitures gives the milkens powerful incentive 
to absent themselves should they choose to do so 
should they flee to someplace where they could not be 
extradited they could live comfortably the rest of their lives 
he said 
liman asked judge wood to free milken without having to make 
bail saying he was a homebody who posed no threat to leave the 
country if the milkens had sought to flee they would have done so 
long ago their attorneys said 
wood ruled that the brothers who both have lived near los 
angeles most of their lives were excellent candidates for bail 
but she set 1 million bail for each of them because of the scope 
of the indictment and the asset retention package 
the bond which will be secured by other assets must be posted 
by monday 
newberg who also faces a racketeering indictment in a related 
case agreed to set aside 16 million in assets he has yet not 
been arraigned because of a skiing injury and no bail terms were 
set 
michael milken 42 has been the main target of the governments 
crackdown on whitecollar crime he is widely credited with 
reshaping corporate america in the 1980s through the sale of 
highyield junk bonds from drexels beverly hills calif office 
the probe of drexel and milken is based in large part on 
information by jailed inside trader ivan boesky whose revelations 
stunned wall street in 1986 boesky has completed one year of a 
threeyear jail term

shareholders of holly farms corp voted 
today on the poultry processors proposed 11 billion merger with 
conagra inc but the results of the ballot were not expected to be 
known until monday 
shareholders met at a memphis hotel to consider the conagra 
proposal which is backed by holly farms management conagra 
shareholders were scheduled to vote on the proposal later in the 
day in omaha where that company is headquartered 
after the holly farms vote was taken officials adjourned the 
meeting until monday 
conagra has threatened court action if parts of a merger 
agreement reached with holly farms last november are not honored 
however tyson foods inc the rival poultry processor that has 
tried since last october to take over holly farms has vowed to 
continue its court fight to block the proposed merger with conagra 
tyson headquartered in springdale ark has made a cash offer 
of 6350 a share to holly farms stockholders for a deal worth 
about 115 billion buying holly farms would permit tyson to 
remain the largest poultry processor in the country 
the proposed conagraholly farms merger calls for a stock swap 
valued at 60 a share for holly farms stockholders holly farms 
shareholders would get 1875 shares of conagra stock for each share 
of holly farms stock traded 
a major point of argument in the conagraholly farms proposal is 
a provision allowing conagra to purchase major holly farms assets 
should the merger fall through 
tyson has filed suit in chancery court in delaware attacking the 
provision as an unfair attempt to block a buyout by anyone else 
the judge handling the suit has said the socalled assetoption 
agreement appears to be unenforcable and has issued a temporary 
injunction blocking it 
under the agreement conagra would be allowed to buy holly farms 
subsidiary harkers inc of lemars iowa for 1488 million holly 
farms of texas inc for a like amount and holly farms facilities in 
wilkesboro nc for 1275 million 
those purchases would cover some 34 percent of holly farms 
total assets 
meanwhile executives of tyson foods entertained shareholders of 
holly farms thursday night a day before the critical vote 
don tyson president of the arkansas firm made a formal pitch 
today to the shareholders 
prior to the meeting of holly shareholders tyson said it had 
been tendered more than 10 million or about 55 percent of hollys 
184 million shares

sources said billionaire hotelier jay pritzker 
joined the wrangling for eastern airlines today in a meeting laden 
with uncertainty following the failed deal to peddle the 
strikedogged carrier to former baseball boss peter ueberroth 
the sources close to the situation said pritzker who reportedly 
has offered 500 million for eastern was among those attending a 
meeting of lawyers for creditors the unions and the airlines 
management at a manhattan law firm the sources asked not to be 
identified 
pritzker owner of the hyatt hotel chain had been interested in 
buying eastern but withdrew after ueberroth announced his agreement 
to buy it april 6 the deal collapsed wednesday because of an 
intractable dispute over whether an outsider would run the airline 
until his group could assume control 
easterns unions have been on strike since march 4 and the 
moneylosing airline has been under federal bankruptcy court 
protection since march 9 
the unions have insisted that frank lorenzo head of parent 
company texas air corp surrender management authority to a 
courtappointed outsider no matter what happens to eastern 
on thursday lorenzo said he is turning attention to his plan to 
reorganize eastern as a much smaller airline 
in miami meanwhile american airlines chief robert crandall 
said american is interested in such eastern assets as its latin 
american and canadian routes american one of easterns leading 
rivals already is expanding to capitalize on the embattled 
carriers problems 
while lorenzo seemed to rule out the possibility of a sale 
federal bankruptcy judge burton lifland moved late wednesday to 
lure other buyers raising the possibility of an auction 
supervised by his court 
and some union leaders at eastern insisted that lorenzos deal 
with the former baseball commissioner could still be revived 
anyone familiar with these situations will tell you that deals 
get done and undone many times almost with predictable regularity 
before being finalized jack bavis head of the pilots union at 
eastern said thursday we believe that mr ueberroth is not 
totally out of the picture yet and there are other potential 
players as well 
eastern machinists leader charles bryan in a speech today in 
fort lauderdale fla said ueberroth had called him this morning 
bryan wouldnt disclose the nature of the call but said he doesnt 
consider ueberroth out of the game 
in addition to ueberroth and pritzker another potential suitor 
is takeover strategist carl icahn owner and chairman of trans 
world airlines inc who said wednesday he is still interested in a 
possible bid for eastern 
under lorenzos new plan eastern will be a lot smaller 
said the chairman of easterns parent texas air corp however he 
asserted we are not going to have any difficulty over time 
building back 
at a separate speaking engagement ueberroth said in response to 
a question on the eastern situation were out of there for 
sure 
the former olympics organizer said he had not been in touch with 
any of the parties involved including lorenzo texas air and 
bankruptcy court officials he would not try to get in touch with 
them and did not expect to hear from them ueberroth told a 
reporter after his speech on sports issues 
the deal is now dead and there are no further negotiations 
because were not prepared to turn over interim control of the 
company to a courtappointed trustee the texas air chief said 
the trustee was a condition easterns unions demanded before they 
would accept ueberroths bid 
the statements by ueberroth and lorenzo came a day after they 
announced their deal had fallen apart thwarting efforts to restore 
eastern to a full flight schedule 
lifland immediately ordered the parties in the case to explain 
on monday why he shouldnt invite other bids for eastern that would 
include major assets it owned before lorenzo bought the airline in 
1986 
the judges move could put pressure on lorenzo to revive his 
deal with ueberroth

lincoln savings and loan association 
which has been up for sale while its arizonabased parent prepared 
to file for bankruptcy protection was seized by federal regulators 
today 
the action against the 29branch sampl was taken on the legal 
grounds that the institutions assets had been substantially 
dissipated and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsound 
condition according to a news release issued by the federal home 
loan bank board 
on thursday the american continental corp the luxury resort 
developer that owns lincoln announced in phoenix ariz it was 
seeking federal bankruptcy protection 
martha gravlee a spokeswoman for the bank board said business 
was being conducted as usual at all lincoln branches she said 
representatives from the bank board the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp and federal deposit insurance corp were in the 
administrative offices here and in los angeles 
but aside from a sign on the door there was no noticeable 
change in operations she said 
the fslic will act as conservator and the fdic will provide a 
managing agent to oversee the associations operations 
f roger clark was appointed by the bank board to serve as chief 
executive officer john h rousselot named lincolns chairman and 
chief executive officer on tuesday resigned those posts today 
rousselot led a group of investors negotiating to buy the 
savings and loan which lost 36 million in the first nine months 
of 1988 but their offer was turned down because it failed to 
include enough cash 
management appeared to operate lincoln mainly for the benefit 
of american continental corp at the expense of the institution 
has repeatedly violated regulations relating to transactions with 
affiliates used poor underwriting and has refused to follow 
supervisory directives the bank board statement said 
lincoln savings operates 29 branches in southern california the 
association has 54 billion in assets 51 billion in liabilities 
and 20 million in regulatory capital the bank board said as of 
mid1988 it was the states 18thlargest thrift measured by assets 
the bank board said lincolns financial troubles started in 
february 1984 when it was bought by american continental 
management abandoned the thrifts traditional operations to 
pursue a rapid growth strategy based on soliticing brokered 
deposits to purchase real estate and to fund high risk acquisition 
development and construction loans equity securities and junk 
bonds the bank board said 
american continental chairman charles h keating said thursday 
the bank board had changed rules as his company tried to sell 
lincoln and finally demanded that the company yield control of 
lincoln to the fslic

in a sprawling warehouselike building 
jerry oleksiw presides over machines that simulate sweat testrip 
bluejeans and generally perform the industrial equivalent of trying 
to gauge how many angels can dance on the head of a pin 
oleksiw recently recounted what he called a perplexing incident 
at the jc penney co quality assurance center set in an 
industrial park on the outskirts of dallas 
pink plastic bags containing ladies imported raincoats had left 
a residue of a powdery pink substance on the garments 
penney inspectors went to work knowing that if any of the 
30000 coats reached customers in that condition the companys 
reputation could be soiled their first thought was dry cleaning 
but oops the cleaning chemicals damaged the waterresistant 
fabric coating 
plan b went into action all the coats would have to be 
laundered and pressed little labels would have to be sewn inside 
advising proper care 
such is a typical headache for an arbiter of quality standards 
to many suppliers this place is known as the graveyard of 
many hopes said oleksiw manager of quality assurance and 
product service for jc penney and a 28year veteran of the 
retailer 
members of his domain include whitecoated laboratory 
technicians who measure almost every conceivable thing that can go 
wrong or wear out 
they stretch and tug jeans to the ripping point they plunge 
boots into a subfreezing chamber to simulate winters worst they 
suck oil out of shoe leather toast toast in toasters and zap food 
in microwaves 
there are devices to duplicate everyday conditions that can 
cause problems for clothing appliances and other goods simulated 
sweat and fake pollution are just two of the hazards these testers 
throw at merchandise guinea pigs 
one machine has been designed to measure the durability of 
clothing material in an unprecedented way oleksiw said during a 
tour it could be said to place penney on the cutting edge of 
fabric tearing 
elsewhere overallclad mechanics scrutinize gardening tools and 
other gear theyve rigged a strobe light to calculate how fast the 
tip of a lawn mower blade spins because a federal safety 
regulation requires blades to rotate less than 19000 feet per 
minute 
outside a lush acre of fescue and bermuda grass stands ready to 
put the mowers through their paces 
much of the work that goes on here duplicates testing done by 
manufacturers penney has developed a reputation in the retail 
industry for being unusually scrupulous about testing outside 
analysts say 
the quality control center is due to move to plano texas in 
late 1992 when penneys corporate offices are scheduled to leave 
intermim headquarters in dallas to take up residence at a new 
429acre site there will be plenty of grass for lawn mowers to mow 
and a pond with ducks to feed the toast

fears that drought conditions could persist for 
another year in the midwest drove grain and soybean futures up 
sharply friday on the chicago board of trade 
despite the fact that spring planting of corn and soybeans has 
not yet begun bullish speculators seized controlled the futures 
markets for those crops amid news reports of belownormal 
springtime precipitation in some western corn belt states 
iowa is the real problem said cathy leow a grainmarket 
analyst in new york with thomson mckinnon securities inc during 
the past month or so theyve only had about 50 percent of normal 
precipitation 
states east of the mississippi river have fared much better 
though and some analysts said traders were simply looking for an 
excuse to bid prices higher 
the wheat market gained on rumors that the united states will 
offer to sell the soviet union more wheat at subsidized prices 
although agriculture department officials said no such decision had 
been made 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 412 a bushel corn was 2 cents

it may not have the glitz of the eastern 
airlines saga but the battle for control of northwest airlines is 
every bit as bitter and much more expensive 
a 26 billion offer already has been made and rejected for 
nwa inc parent of the nations fourthlargest airline and 
several more potential suitors are waiting in the wings amid 
speculation the bidding will top 3 billion 
while the eastern story features such names as former baseball 
commissioner peter ueberroth former defense secretary frank 
carlucci and texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo the northwest 
cast includes oil and movie mogul marvin davis and nixon white 
house staffer frederick malek among others 
the primary shark circling northwest has been davis the former 
owner of 20th century fox film corp who made his fortune 
wildcatting in oil and is worth an estimated 16 billion 
davis proposed board of directors for northwest includes audrey 
meadows six who played alice kramden on the honeymooners 
television show 
leading the charge for northwest the nations fourthlargest 
air carrier is its 42yearold chairman steven rothmeier a former 
notre dame fullback and army lieutenant in vietnam who gives ground 
grudgingly if at all 
the dollars in the northwest deal dwarf those offered for 
eastern which is ranked seventh among air carriers ueberroth led 
a 464 million bid to acquire eastern from its parent texas air 
while davis and northwest battle toe to toe other investment 
groups await an opening 
one group wesray capital corp was founded by former treasury 
secretary william simon the other which northwest has said holds 
49 percent of its 291 million shares includes gary l wilson a 
walt disney co executive who left northwests board in november 
al checchi a former associate of the wealthy bass family of fort 
worth texas and malek who also was a campaign adviser to 
president bush 
the crowd eyeing northwest and its assetrich balance sheet have 
swung the odds against rothmeiers efforts to keep the airline 
independent 
no less an authority on hostile takeovers than minneapolis 
financier irwin jacobs a friend of rothmeier says the airline is 
definitely in danger of a takeover 
northwest has a lot of honey and marvin davis is only the 
first bee said kurt rivard an analyst for minneapolisbased 
dain bosworth inc i think there will be others 
the honey was cured by a string of managers who hated debt and 
managed conservatively texas airs lorenzo may be legendary for 
his antiunion rhetoric and action but he cant compare to a 
costcutting predecessor of rothmeier named donald nyrop who once 
removed the doors from the stalls in the mens room because he 
thought executives were spending too much time reading there 
the stingy leadership has given northwest ownership of 222 of 
its 312 airplanes well above the industry standard if northwest 
is sold the new owners could sell part of the fleet and lease it 
back earning more on the planes than northwest originally paid for 
them the revenue could be used to repay debt incurred in a 
takeover 
also attractive to raiders are northwests domination of gates 
at airports in the twin cities and detroit its downtown tokyo real 
estate holdings that could fetch 500 million its rank as the 
largest cargo carrier among us passenger airlines and its no 1 
position in the worlds fastestgrowing airline market the 
pacific rim 
rivard said there is room to expand the airline internationally 
and nationally domestically northwest is strongest in the 
midwest where rothmeier grew up 
rothmeier was raised by a germanamerican father and 
danishamerican mother in faribault a town of about 17000 some 50 
miles south of minneapolis 
his football career at notre dame was cut short by a knee injury 
his sophomore season and he turned to business academics with such 
spartanlike intensity that he earned the nickname sparty 
before going on to earn an mba at the university of chicago the 
6foot 190pound rothmeier commanded a supply company for the army 
in vietnam his first job after graduation was at northwest 
not known for flair rothmeier chose a neighborhood steak house 
in st paul to finalize northwests 884 million deal to acquire 
twin cities rival republic airlines in 1986 after weathering more 
than a year of labor turmoil and a spate of passenger complaints 
stemming from the merger northwest emerged with record profits for 
1988 of 1351 million up 31 percent from 1987 
when he gets up to go to the bathroom at night he probably 
makes the bed william genoese director of the airline division 
of the international brotherhood of teamsters said of rothmeiers 
need for order 
rothmeiers defense against davis and the others so far has been 
to adopt a poison pill antitakeover defense that davis and 
dissident shareholders are challenging in court northwest also has 
won a temporary restraining order preventing davis from making 
disruptive contacts with the three labor unions representing 
34000 of nwas 38000 employees 
rothmeier is negotiating a new contract with his 5000 pilots 
whose loyalty will be important to thwart a takeover a negotiating 
subcommittee has been formed to discuss the creation of an employee 
stock ownership program which would act as another antitakeover 
measure by putting more stock in friendly hands 
meanwhile davis has said he will spend up to 2 million to 
stage a proxy fight for control of the nwa board of director at a 
may 15 meeting if he attracts enough followers he could gain 
control of the board and throw rothmeier out

three years after ah robins co filed for 
bankruptcy court protection in the face of thousands of claims from 
women who used its dalkon shield birth control device the 
pharmaceutical company is still in court 
but buoyed by sales of products like chap stick and robitussin 
cough medicine robins earnings have soared to record levels and 
its stock prices have quintupled 
the richmondbased company reported record sales of 9338 
million in 1988 up 9 percent from a year earlier its operating 
earnings 1844 million were also up 9 percent from 1987 giving 
the company net earnings of 584 million or 242 per share 
after accounting for bankruptcyrelated expenses 
robins financial success during its reorganization under 
bankruptcy laws shows good management and the power of brand names 
wilbur ross of rothschild inc financial consultants for robins 
stockholders said friday 
the fellow buying chap stick doesnt really care if the parent 
company is bankrupt or not he said 
robins is currently awaiting a ruling on the appeal of its 
chapter 11 reorganization plan which calls for it to be acquired 
by american home products corp of new york for 32 billion 
while most companies file for bankruptcy protection because of 
debt robins filed under chapter 11 in 1985 because of dalkon 
shield litigation ross said at the time of the filing robins had 
already paid 520 million on 9400 claims from women who used the 
intrauterine device 
robins removed the dalkon shield from the market in the 
mid1970s after it was shown to cause sterility birth defects and 
other serious injuries 
the whole bankruptcy was very unusual ross said the 
normal business was fine stayed fine and presumably will continue 
to be fine if we ever get the deal with american home 
whats amazing is that the rest of the management didnt get 
too distracted during bankruptcy he said the case was always 
mainly about dalkon shield problems and the management did a very 
good job isolating those problems from the rest of the company 
the controversy over the dalkon shield and the bankruptcy court 
filing apparently has not affected the companys sales which have 
climbed steadily throughout the decade 
i dont really think its been a factor robins spokesman 
roscoe e puckett jr said the fact that sales have increased is 
ample evidence that consumers have not had any worries about the 
companys products 
stockholders initially sold their shares when the company filed 
for bankruptcy protection bringing stock values as low as 550 
robins stock is now worth about 26 
american home products has the option to pull out of the merger 
if the appeals process is not completed by this july 26 one year 
after the plan was confirmed in bankruptcy court but given that 
robins value has continued to increase since the deal was made 
ross said that possibility is slim 
the least likely thing in the whole world is that american 
home will back out he said thered be a line of other people 
from richmond to new york wanting to buy robins

a cloud hangs over the junkbond market where 
prices have fallen 2 percent and more in the past week ahead of a 
flood of new issues and amid fears that a recession could push some 
companies to the brink of default on their interest payments 
by friday traders said some junk bonds had touched new lows 
falling as much as 40 to 50 per 1000 in face value in some 
cases 
without the magic wand of junkbond pioneer michael milken the 
180 billion market cant seem to shrug off a sense of impending 
doom milken who was indicted last month on 98 racketeering and 
fraud charges had the ability to calm the highyield highrisk 
market in times of turmoil 
he was the biggest factor in keeping stability in the 
market said one trader who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there was a feeling among dealers that milken would make sure the 
market wouldnt go to hell in a hand basket 
much of the markets concern centers on solomon asset 
management whose founder david b solomon has been cooperating 
with the government in its investigation of milken and drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
solomon is leaving solomon asset and there is concern that the 
firm might be forced to sell its huge portfolio of junk bonds to 
meet cash demands from nervous pension clients 
it also is rumored that a dozen or more junkbond fund managers 
have been subpoenaed in connection with the drexel case it 
doesnt take much to make life miserable said advest inc trader 
john moran 
in terms of prices its a really bad market all throughout 
he said some issues had strengthened slightly friday but even 
many of the better junk bonds were unable to recoup earlier losses 
moran pointed to duracells 13 percent bonds due in the year 
2000 which were up point from fridays low but still down 2 
points from a week ago 
fundamentally traders bemoaned redemptions by junkbond mutual 
funds small investors started pulling out of the funds a week ago 
but nervousness spilled over to institutional portfolio managers 
who also began withdrawing funds 
upcoming issues of 9 billion in new junk bonds led by 5 
billion in new debt to finance the megabuyout of rjr nabisco inc 
also weighed heavily on the market 
people are in a cautious frame of mind and may not be a good 
audience for those issues one trader said to lure reluctant 
investors underwriters might have to up yields on those issues 
which likely would depress prices of existing debt securities 
also dogging the market are fears of recession which could make 
it tough for companies laden with highinterest debt to make 
interest payments to bondholders 
many companies with a great deal of debt may be very 
vulnerable if there is a decline in business activity one trader 
said companies havent been tested with all this debt before 
several companies with outstanding junk bonds already are 
experiencing difficulties analysts point to wickes cos and 
interco which they say are having trouble selling certain assets 
as planned to help pay off their junk bonds and junk bonds of 
resorts international whose cashflow from operations is not 
sufficient to meet its interest obligations have been weak 
traders also were talking about reports of an unpublished study 
led by a harvard university professor that tracked junk bonds 
issued a decade ago and found the default rate was 34 percent far 
higher than other studies had shown 
in the past when a study like that would come out mike 
milken did a good job of tearing it up moran said 
analysts were debunking the study but none seemed to have 
milkens clout michael dahood a managing director at smith 
barney harris upham amp co noted that the study only tracked a 
dozen or so issues and that it was sensational to conclude that 
of 100 nowoutstanding issues 34 will default 
its clear that theres going to be over time a greater loss 
experience associated with below investmentgrade bonds than what 
historically the numbers might suggest but even if a company 
does default it does not necessarily mean a loss of value that the 
word default conjures up dahood said

junk bond dynamo michael milken agreed friday to 
set aside more than 600 million of his assets to guarantee payment 
if he is convicted of fraud and racketeering charges in the 
governments largestever securities prosecution 
the former drexel burnham lambert inc financier also was 
ordered to post a 1 million bond and surrender his passport in 
exchange for his freedom until an expected trial later this year 
culminating wall streets insider trading scandals 
prosecutors said the agreement to place 600 million in accounts 
to be monitored by the government was believed to be the largest 
pretrial asset restraint ever under federal racketeering statutes 
the defendants not only contest the indictment but they 
seriously expressly contest the governments theories on 
forfeiture arthur l liman milkens attorney said at the 
hearing in manhattan federal court 
us district judge kimba wood turned down a government request 
that milken post an additional 250 million in bail money saying 
the 42yearold former broker was unlikely to flee the country 
before a trial 
in addition milkens brother lowell who also faces fraud and 
racketeering charges agreed to set aside 50 million in assets and 
also was ordered to post a 1 million bond secured by other assets 
by monday 
the milkens left the courthouse to applause from dozens of 
supporters who attended the hearing including some wearing caps 
reading mike milken we believe in you the brothers did not 
comment 
the milkens and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg were 
charged with defrauding clients through insider trading and stock 
manipulation in a 98count indictment handed up march 29 
the racketeering charges seek 185 billion in forfeitures from 
each man and they could be forced to pay double that in fines if 
convicted 
under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
the government could have frozen all of the defendants assets to 
ensure they wouldnt liquidate them or transfer ownership in 
anticipation of a guilty verdict 
instead prosecutors and defense lawyers hammered out a bond 
package that requires michael milken to place 300 million cash in 
an account to be monitored by the government and to sign a note 
securing 300 million more in less liquid assets 
he is not prohibited from making investments or otherwise 
managing his money 
milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdings 
in drexel which total 6 percent of the investment firm and are 
estimated at about 100 million as soon as the firms settlement 
of separate civil charges with the securities and exchange 
commission officially takes effect 
in substance your honor we expect the security for 
forfeiture in this case will amount to 700 million assistant 
us attorney john k carroll said 
assistant us attorney bruce baird who heads the office 
securities and commodities fraud section said the restraints were 
the largest for a securities case and likely the largest ever 
i dont know of one with numbers like this he said 
the drexelsec deal announced thursday resolves a range of 
charges and forces the nations fifthlargest investment firm to 
dismiss milken sever all business dealings with him and make him 
relinquish his drexel holdings the firm also will be subject to 
rigorous federal supervision for three years 
milken who reportedly made more than 1 billion between 1983 
and 1987 under the deal also is barred from transferring any 
assets out of the country and must gradually sell assets to convert 
the 300 million note to cash 
carroll sought 250 million in bail claiming the potential 
racketeering forfeiture gives the milkens powerful incentive to 
absent themselves should they choose to do so 
should they flee to someplace where they could not be 
extradited they could live comfortably the rest of their lives 
he told the judge 
liman asked wood to free milken without bail saying he was a 
homebody who posed no threat to leave the country if the 
milkens had sought to flee they would have done so long ago their 
attorneys said 
wood said the brothers who both have lived near los angeles 
most of their lives were unlikely to flee but she set the 1 
million bail because of the scope of the indictment and the asset 
retention package 
the probe of drexel and milken is based in large part on 
information by jailed inside trader ivan boesky whose revelations 
stunned wall street in 1986 boesky has completed one year of a 
threeyear jail term 
the one thing you can bet on is that our clients are going to 
be in court liman said there is nothing that will keep them 
from coming to this court and confronting boesky 
newberg who also faces a racketeering indictment in a related 
case agreed to set aside 16 million in assets he has yet not 
been arraigned because of a skiing injury and no bail terms were 
set 
michael milken has been the main target of the governments 
crackdown on whitecollar crime he is widely credited with 
reshaping corporate america in the 1980s through the sale of 
highyield junk bonds from drexels beverly hills calif office

steel imports in february were the lowest of 
any month since october 1985 and were well within the limits of the 
nations steel import quotas two industry groups said friday 
the american iron and steel institute representing domestic 
producers from its base in washington dc said foreign producers 
are shipping less steel to the united states because they can get 
higher prices elsewhere 
februarys tonnage was 134 million tons down from 178 million 
tons in january and 191 million tons in february 1988 the aisi 
said 
major countries who participate in the voluntary us trade 
system shipped only threequarters of the metal authorized by their 
negotiated quotas the organization said 
us producers to lobbying the bush administration to extend the 
fiveyear quota plan beyond its sept 30 expiration even though 
their profits have surging over the last two years the companies 
say they need continued trade protection to recover fully from 
massive financial losses from 1980 to 1986 
the lightest monthly import total before february was 130 
million tons or 173 percent of the market in october 1985 
the february tonnage represented 168 percent of the domestic 
market the quotas were intended to limit imports to about 20 
percent of the market 
the rival american institute for imported steel a new 
yorkbased association of importers said that februarys imports 
represented 14 percent of the us market not counting 188000 
tons of semifinished products ordered by us steelmakers for 
further processing on their mills the quotas goal for finished 
steel is 185 percent 
the increasing volume of semifinished steel imports badly 
needed by domestic rolling mills themselves continues a trend 
evident since the beginning of 1988 aiis president john griffin 
said in a statement 
both organizations interpret information supplied by the 
commerce department

continental airlines decision to raise some of 
its fares at the start of the busy summer tourist season prompted 
several of its competitors friday to match the increases 
braniff airways said it would go along with continentals 
increases announced thursday in markets where the two carriers 
compete twa and america west said they also would go along with 
the higher fares effective in late may 
united delta usair and southwest airlines said they had not 
yet decided whether to join in the price increases while american 
airlines said it had no immediate plans to concur 
braniff spokesman rick boubelik said the increases which apply 
to socalled max saver fares affect about 85 percent of the 
dallasbased airlines schedule 
cities where braniff would hold the line on fares primarily 
would be in the midwest like topeka and salinas kan on flights 
both east and west he said 
we do pricing for smaller commuter markets and some of those 
markets have already gotten high and we dont think they can take 
another hike he said 
the braniff increases will affect advancepurchase tickets will 
range from 20 to 80 and will begin with those placing 
reservations on may 28 
well match them twa spokesman bob blattner said but we 
wont touch business fares 
continental said thursday its increases ranged to 20 each way 
depending on the market the boosts would not apply to first class 
and fullfare coach tickets 
continental spokesman ned walker said the increases were made in 
anticipation of the prime summer tourist season 
as an example of the new price plan for tickets bought after may 
26 a continental roundtrip flight from newark to los angeles will 
increase from 298 offpeak and 398 peak to 358 offpeak and 438 
peak 
summer is the busiest time and this modest increase reflects 
that demand walker said 
however one airline spokesman speaking on the condition he 
would not be identified said while fares often increase during the 
summer due to greater demand the continental increase was not 
modest but was the largest hed seen in at least seven years 
he speculated it was related to the troubles of sister carrier 
eastern 
eastern crippled for a month by a strike and continental both 
are owned by houstonbased texas air corp 
continental has tried to place itself as a pricing leader but 
its usually in the other direction the spokesman at a 
competing carrier said now theyre trying to recoup some of 
those low fares 
at american airlines spokesman jim brown said the carrier had 
no plans to immediately follow its competition 
we are still studying the proposal and its likely we will not 
make a decision for several days brown said 
we have not made any decision delta spokeswoman jackie tate 
said were just analyzing what happened

lowell jay milken is two years younger than his 
betterknown brother michael he never traded junk bonds he isnt 
michaels righthand man he prefers the background and he faces 
85 fewer charges of committing criminal acts 
friends dispute the perception of lowell milken as the guy in 
the back room hunched over a ledger wearing a green eyeshade 
toiling away for his brother as he was described in a 1988 book 
about milken and drexel the predators ball 
lowell has been very much his own man said martin klein a 
new york lawyer and friend of lowells younger by two years but 
certainly not any less creative or any less dedicated or any less 
hardworking 
but as michael milkens star rose in the late 1970s and 1980s as 
the architect of drexel burnham lambert incs highyield bond 
department lowells climbed with it and the brothers earned 
hundreds of millions of dollars 
now their fates are inextricably linked in the governments 
massive racketeering and fraud indictment which defense lawyers 
contend includes the other milken only to pressure michael into a 
settlement 
friends describe lowell milken as a devoted family man 
hardworking modest in taste and lifestyle despite his wealth 
devoted to running a charitable foundation formed four years before 
the government began probing drexel and the milkens 
lowell milken 40 looks nothing like his brother who stands 
over 6 feet tall wears black curly hair and has an angular face 
and narrow eyes lowell has straight sandy hair and is shorter 
and bespectacled both are described as sometimes abrasive at work 
like his brother lowell graduated from the university of 
california at berkeley in 1970 winning the business departments 
top student award that eluded michael two years earlier 
michael went east to the university of pennsylvanias wharton 
school but lowell attended the university of california at los 
angeles law school where he was an editor of the law review he 
joined the los angeles firm of irell amp manella where he is 
remembered as assiduous and creative in the fields of tax and 
corporate law 
but he left the firm in 1978 to join his brother at drexels 
highyield bond department in beverly hills calif where michael 
had moved the group from the investment firms new york 
headquarters 
while michael ran the xshaped trading desk lowell worked in an 
office on the other side of the floor michael won fame for 
reshaping american business through the issue of highyield 
highrisk bonds lowell worked on other less public tasks 
to be sure lowell earned less than michaels gargantuan 1 
billion in compensation from 198387 but his 100 million hardly 
could be considered a slight he lives in a sevenbedroom home in 
encino calif with his wife and three young sons friends say 
family photos not expensive artwork fill the walls of the posh 
suburban home 
drexel spokesman steven anreder and lowells attorney michael 
armstrong said lowells job at drexel involved administrative 
matters such as finding and buying the junk bond headquarters some 
research duties on real estate and bankruptcy laws and reviewing 
personal investments by drexel employees 
his duties involved administrative and other duties that 
simply were not involved with the matters the government has 
mischaracterized in order to make its charges armstrong said 
hes in this case primarily to put pressure on his brother in 
our view he said 
the 98count indictment of the milkens and former drexel trader 
bruce lee newberg describes lowell as his brothers principal 
adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy he also is said to be 
the administrator of certain investment partnerships created by the 
junk bond department 
lowell is charged with two counts of racketeering and 11 counts 
of fraud in what prosecutors describe as a longterm scheme that 
swindled clients and investors by manipulating stocks and skirting 
laws during planned mergers or takeovers 
according to the indictment lowell played no formal role in 
making allegedly fraudulent stock transactions in fact he doesnt 
even have a license to trade securities but he allegedly 
participated in the racketeering enterprise in other ways 
in one count lowell is alleged to have joined a march 1986 
telephone call regarding a 53 million payment with ivan boesky 
who provided much of the information leading to the milken 
indictment as part of a plea deal to settle fraudulent dealings 
and then lied to accountants to cover it up 
lowell also is named along with michael in the securities and 
exchange commissions civil suit charging them with insider trading 
and securities fraud 
associates said lowell milken spends much of time administering 
the foundations of the milken families which were set up in 1982 
and have donated millions of dollars to city and state programs and 
charities in education human rights and health and welfare 
the market value of the foundations assets grew from 439 
million in 1985 to more than 193 million in 1987 in which it 
handed out 15 million in donations lowell and his wife sandra 
set up their own charitable foundation in 1986 
recipients of milken foundation money said that lowell like 
michael has taken personal interest in the charities and not 
merely doled out the money 
he really cares and believes in the things hes doing said 
nancy honig president of the quality education project in 
california which works with nonenglish speaking and disadvantaged 
parents in poor areas hes very clear about what he expects to 
have happen 
critics of the milkens said they have played up their charitable 
roles to try to counter the impression left by the governments 
charges but friends of the milkens including a public relations 
firm they hired to speak for them say the foundation contributed 
millions before the government began its investigation 
said attorney armstrong its hearts and flowers and i know 
its the old violin but thats the fact

johnson a vice president at harris trust and savings bank in

wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 percent 
in march the government said friday in a report that buoyed 
spirits on wall street where fears of spiraling inflation had 
risen in tandem with earlier steep price increases 
analysts said that while last months restrained gain in the 
producer price index for finished goods should allay fears that 
inflation will skyrocket it does indicate that price rises persist 
marchs 04 percent gain combined with steep gains of 10 
percent in january and february works out to a compound annual 
inflation rate of 102 percent for the first quarter of 1989 
that is the largest quarterly increase in eight years and 
represents a sharp escalation from the 1988 inflation rate of 40 
percent 
nevertheless the stock market cheered by the apparent easing 
in inflationary pressures was up sharply gaining 4106 points to 
close at 233706 
the market appeared to shrug off fridays merchandise trade 
report which showed the deficit widening 209 percent in february 
to 105 billion 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington 
mass noted that while the trade gap widened the change was in 
line with what analysts had expected and amounted to moderately 
good news 
the deficit is not shrinking but we didnt expect it to 
anyway she said we dont see it improving this year by any 
significant amount 
analyst latta said the combined effect of fridays reports was 
to suggest the economy is definitely slowing and inflation is a 
problem but its not necessarily a worsening problem 
for a year the federal reserve board has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and thus dampen 
inflationary pressures analysts are divided over whether the 
central bank will be able to slow the economy just enough to check 
inflation without unintentionally pushing the country into a 
recession 
two other economic reports friday provided signs of a possible 
easing of inflationary pressures and a slowing of the economy as it 
enters the seventh year of its record peacetime expansion 
those reports showed 
the operating rate for us factories declined for the second 
consecutive month in march while the pace of industrial production 
was flat for a second straight month as well when factories have 
excess capacity there is less likelihood that they will have 
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand which could lead to 
shortages and price increases 
business inventories rose a moderate 05 percent in february 
while sales plunged 09 percent the steepest decline in more than 
two years when increases in inventories are not accompanied by 
rising sales the result could be production cutbacks that hold 
down economic growth 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm said the 
underlying rate of inflation probably remains around 4 percent 
although some further sharp price increases may occur 
we have a couple of bad reports to go but the key is that 
underlying trends show no acceleration he said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said officials were 
happy to see a moderating influence on inflation it seems to 
indicate the economy is slowing to the point where inflationary 
fears are subsiding 
analysts expected no immediate new credittightening from the 
fed as a result of the latest economic reports further information 
about the price increases in march will be known tuesday when the 
labor department releases its consumer price index for the month 
last months rise in wholesale prices one stop short of retail 
reflected higher costs for both food and energy although the 
increases in both categories were smaller than those registered in 
the first two months of the year 
wholesale food prices rose 08 percent last month after jumping 
12 percent in february last months increase in food costs was 
led by a 388 percent gain in prices for eggs vegetable costs 
dropped 116 percent after surging 353 percent in february 
energy prices increased 09 percent in march following a 24 
percent increase in the previous month last months increase was 
led by a 168 percent rise in home heating oil prices while 
gasoline costs rose 35 percent natural gas prices declined 54 
percent due to the mild january weather and swelling stocks of 
natural gas 
excluding the volatile food and energy categories prices rose 
03 percent in march down from a 06 percent increase a month 
earlier 
the overall march gain left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1122 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11220 last month that 
was up 50 cents from february and 56 percent above march 1988 
dirk van dongen president of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors said the latest report was good news but 
doesnt totally put to rest worries about accelerating inflation 
i dont think at all that this suggests that the inflation 
watch should be terminated he said 
he pointed to steeper price increases last month at earlier 
stages of production prices at the intermediate level for items 
such as flour and cloth were up 07 percent while the cost of 
crude goods such as cotton and wheat rose 23 percent

international business machines corp said 
friday its firstquarter profit rose 18 percent excluding an 
accounting change and the stock market responded favorably to the 
news 
the gain came in spite of a chip problem that caused a delay in 
shipment of mainframe computers the biggest and most profitable 
part of ibms product line 
ibms stock rose 162 to 11087 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading contributing to wall streets best day 
since october 
ibms showing some great progress said don young an 
analyst at sanford c bernstein amp co 
the worlds biggest computer company said it earned 950 million 
in the three months ended march 31 ibm earned 933 million a year 
earlier from normal operations but final net income in 1988 was 
125 billion after inclusion of a 315 million gain from the 
accounting change 
including the effect of the onetime gain in 1988 net income 
fell 239 percent the accounting change related to the treatment 
of deferred taxes 
earnings per share were 161 that was up from 157 in 1988 
before the accounting change but down from the 210 recorded 
after the accounting change 
revenue rose 56 percent to 127 billion from 1206 billion 
ibms product and service offerings continue to grow stronger 
and we are benefiting from our improving customer partnerships as 
well as our restructuring actions john f akers the chairman 
and chief executive said in a statement 
our expectations for 1989 remain unchanged akers said 
young said he was impressed that revenue grew 56 percent in 
spite of the mainframe delivery problem and the rise in the dollar 
which makes revenue earned overseas worth less in dollars 
ibm is successfully stretching out the life of its 4yearold 
mainframe line while benefiting from strong sales of its new 
as400 midrange computers and increasing acceptance of its personal 
system2 personal computers young said 
if not for the shipment shortfall on 3090s mainframes we 
would have had a very superior quarter said jay stevens a dean 
witter reynolds inc analyst 
ibms results have been hurt by the slow growth in demand for 
big mainframe computers which are being overtaken by speedy 
personal computers and workstations 
sanford c bernstein estimates that worldwide sales of 
microcomputer hardware will surpass worldwide sales of mainframe 
hardware for the first time this year 49 billion to 45 billion 
but ibm is wellpositioned to cope with the changing technology 
because of its strength in pcs young said its hard to say this 
is a mainframe company theyre the worlds largest pc supplier

the alaskan oil spill

deliveries 
the market didnt respond immediately so the news had more of

holly farms corp shareholders voted 
friday on a proposed 11 billion merger with conagra inc as holly 
farms managers continued efforts to block a takeover by rival 
poultry processor tyson foods inc 
r lee taylor ii chief executive officer of holly farms said a 
preliminary vote count was expected monday 
if the merger is turned down then the holly farms board of 
directors will have to review all of the alternatives available to 
the company taylor said declining to outline what those 
alternatives might be 
meanwhile conagra stockholders backed the merger plan by a 96 
percent to 4 percent margin during a special meeting friday in 
omaha 
charles m harper conagras chairman and chief executive 
officer said he was hopeful but not optimistic the merger 
plan would receive the required twothirds approval of holly farms 
shareholders 
holly farms has about 5500 stockholders with 181 million 
shares about 200 people attended holly farms shareholder meeting 
with much of the voting conducted by proxy 
no matter how the holly farms shareholders voted the merger 
proposal is expected to end up in court but harper said he was 
confident his companys plan eventually would prevail 
i would be optimistic about the outcome in normal 
circumstances but these circumstances have become abnormal i 
might even say bizarre he said 
since tyson learned on nov 17 that conagra had the highest 
and best bid tyson has consistently tried to undermine the merger 
and conagras contract rights harper said 
tyson the nations largest poultry processor is offering 115 
billion for the memphisbased holly farms a national leader in 
fresh poultry sales 
taylor and tyson president don tyson of springdale ark 
addressed the holly farms shareholders prior to the vote both men 
promised to make good use of the stockholders money 
the scramble for holly farms began last october when tyson 
offered a cash and stock swap valued at 4950 a share for holly 
farms stockholders 
tysons current offer is 6350 a share in cash and although 
holly farms shareholders did not vote on the bid directly don 
tyson urged them to keep it in mind 
the conagra merger a stock swap arrangement would be worth 
about 60 a share to holly farms stockholders 
tyson and holly would be a perfect fit tyson said that 
is why we are offering more money for your stock than anyone else 
in urging stockholders to approve the merger with conagra 
taylor praised his companys performance and promised continued 
good business 
holly farms expects average earnings per share of 611 for 1989 
through 1993 at a time when chicken prices are expected to decline 
taylor said 
were looking at some strong performance he said we hope 
you will keep our outlook for the future in mind 
market analysts have said holly farms would likely retain much 
of its independence with conagra while the same is not assured 
with tyson 
a chancery court in delaware dealing with a suit brought by 
tyson is reviewing an assetoption agreement in the proposed 
conagraholly farms merger that would allow conagra to buy prime 
holly farms assets should the deal fall through 
tyson contends the agreement is an illegal attempt to make holly 
farms unattractive to any buyer other than conagra conagra has 
vowed to defend the agreement in court 
tyson has conditioned its buyout offer on the removal of the 
asset agreement and that in turn has led holly farms to portray 
tysons bid as unassurred 
we would like our stockholders to receive a clean and clear 
proposal from tyson taylor said 
under the asset agreement conagra would be allowed to buy holly 
farms subsidiary harkers inc of lemars iowa for 1488 million 
holly farms of texas inc for a like amount and holly farms 
facilities in wilkesboro nc for 1275 million 
those purchases would cover some 34 percent of holly farms 
total assets 
natalie cockrell a holly farms stockholder since the 1950s 
pulled taylor aside after the meeting to ask about the assetoption 
agreement 
he explain to me that it was the only way they could get the 
offer from conagra but i still dont understand what will 
happen if the judge says its illegal she said 
harry kingston a holly farms stockholder with 1440 shares 
said he voted for the merger since the conagra stock swap is 
nontaxable 
if you take the cash money its going to throw you in a higher 
tax bracket and i cant see giving the government that much 
money kingston said 
in his pitch to holly farms stockholders tyson said his company 
has been good to its shareholders 
if you bought 100 shares of tyson when it went public in 1963 
it would have cost you 1050 today that 100 shares through 
stock splits would be 12000 shares worth 180000 tyson said

securities in the governments first fraud investigation emanating 
from the october 1987 market crash

pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities and 
mail fraud and obstructing an investigation by the securities and 
exchange commission 
he faces a maximum 10 years in prison and 500000 in fines a 
sentencing date was not set by us district judge thomas p griesa 
lorin also agreed to cooperate with the governments continuing 
investigation of haas securities corp a brokerage house that 
collapsed nine days after the oct 19 1987 stock market crash 
prosecutors maintain the firms alleged scheme to artificially 
raise the prices of penny stocks inexpensive securities traded 
over the counter couldnt be maintained after the market drop and 
share prices tumbled 
eugene laff former haas chairman was charged last month with 
15 counts of conspiring to mainipulate the prices of the same three 
stocks to increase their value in a scheme that included lorin 
both cases are based on the confessions of stanley a aslanian 
jr a former haas securities trader and president who pleaded 
guilty in january to conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the 
government he has not been sentenced 
laff and aslanian were listed as coconspirators in the 
twocount criminal information to which lorin pleaded guilty 
lorin admitted to conspiring with laff and aslanian from july 
1986 until haas securities went out of business to manipulate the 
stock prices of flores de new mexico inc ts industries inc 
and big o tires inc 
the information states that the three through haas securities 
raised the stock prices at a time when sell orders exceeded buy 
orders and cornered the market on the stocks by accumulating 
hundreds of thousands of shares in haas inventories and setting 
artificially high prices 
i knew the prices were artificially high prices and helped to 
maintain the prices lorin told judge griesa 
laff and aslanian allegedly sought to create the appearance of 
demand for the three stock by selling some of the stock to accounts 
controlled by lorin listed in other peoples names 
the value of the deals and profits from the manipulations have 
not been listed in any court papers in the haas securities case 
lorin also admitted to giving false and misleading testimony to 
the sec in july 1987 when he denied placing stock orders for big o 
tires 
the investigation began when investors demanded information 
about the stocks after the crash haas securities allegedly was 
able to sustain the prices for several days after the crash until 
it filed for bankruptcy and the manipulated share prices plunged 
assistant us attorney bruce baird said the case was the first 
alleged fraud brought to light because of the crash 
the things haas was doing began before the crash but it was 
the crash that resulted in the downfall of haas and all these 
things came to life baird said

freesenotis for at least another week of belownormal 
precipitation in the corn belt and they ignored or downplayed the 
national weather services 30day outlook for normal precipitation 
in the midwest

have another drought said cathy leow a grainmarket analyst 
with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york when you have 
that kind of mentality going on then of course the price is going 
to go up

illinois northern missouri nebraska and southern minnesota 
but he said there still was plenty of time for soil moisture to 
improve before planting begins in earnest

the midwest for the second half of next week

sales of washington apples are returning to 
normal levels following the recent controversy over the use of the 
growthregulating chemical alar an industry official said friday 
outofstate apple shipments rose 18 percent in the past week 
to 141 million boxes from 119 million the week before said bill 
dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association 
thats approaching the 156 million boxes shipped the week of 
march 9 just before three consecutive weeks of sliding sales 
prompted by consumer fears last year at this time warehouses 
shipped 12 million boxes 
a report released by the natural resources defense council in 
late february indicated that eating apples treated with the alar 
increased cancer risk in children 
the report was denounced by the apple industry which said only 
about 5 percent of the crop is treated with the chemical and 
several federal agencies declared apples safe to eat 
an nrdc attorney who coauthored the alar report friday offered 
an olive branch to growers of the nations largest apple crop 
we want to make peace with growers janet hathaway of the 
washington dcbased environmental group said it would be very 
useful if growers started to see we are on the same side 
dewitt said exports were up 13000 boxes to 119000 shipped 
with 57000 of those sent to taiwan taiwan had been the most 
visible foreign market to drop washington apple imports after the 
controversy started 
apple shipments to retailers exporters and institutional users 
are considered an accurate measure of consumer sales 
i think fortunately the people have short memories and maybe 
they are coming back to buying apples said dewitt whose group 
collects shipment from washington warehouses gathered by state 
government 
people are beginning to realize that if there really was a 
problem theyd be taking them off the market like chilean 
grapes he said 
prices remain soft with the top grade of red delicious apples 
bringing just 11 to 12 per 42pound box 2 to 3 below the level 
prior to the alar flap and barely above the cost of production 
alar is the marketing name for daminozide which is mostly used 
on red apples to improve color firmness and increase shelf life 
its use still is legal but the federal environmental protection 
agency has proposed banning it next year

belgian endive the butt of jokes during the 
presidential campaign is gaining respectability in massachusetts 
where researchers are developing new varieties and promoters call 
it the white gold of the vegetable kingdom 
more than 150 chefs and restaurant owners gathered thursday for 
a sumptuous repast of belgian endive with caviar cold cream of 
endive soup and braised endive with veal 
though he did not attend the toast of the 15000 party thrown 
by belgian produce shippers was gov michael s dukakis who 
appears to have nearly as devoted a following among endive sellers 
as among greekamericans 
hes certainly done a lot for us in publicity said franz 
dahlem director of the belgian endive marketing board and host of 
the leafy fete 
when dukakis suggested during the iowa caucuses that 
hardpressed corn and soybean farmers try growing the yuppie 
produce it was a debacle for his democratic presidential campaign 
his farm policy is the belgian endive dan quayle later told 
a crowd in des moines and his defense policy is the belgian 
waffle 
dukakis may have bristled but the belgians were grateful 
its like we say it doesnt matter whether people tell good 
things about you just that they tell about you dahlem said in a 
heavy flemish accent 
indeed these are salad days for belgian endive a relative of 
chicory with blanched leaves lettucelike texture and a tangy 
flavor 
thanks both to dukakis and the trendiness of exotic produce in 
general us sales shot up from 300 tons in 1981 to 3000 tons 
last year according to the marketing board 
at an average supermarket price of 2 to 3 a pound belgian 
endive sales total about 15 million a year but on a per capita 
basis americans are still microconsumers of the vegetable eating 
less than one ounce per person per year compared to 20 pounds per 
person in belgium 
belgians are also the dominant growers producing about 80 
percent of the worlds crop but scientists at the university of 
massachusetts at amherst are hoping to change that 
their research which began three years ago and has received 
170000 of funding from the us department of agriculture is 
aimed at developing new varieties and hydroponic or waterbased 
growing techniques it could turn a corner next year when farmers 
start growing experimental batches 
the chinese may not be far behind professor kenneth a corey 
who is supervising the research has two postdoctoral students 
from the peoples republic of china who are interested in taking 
the crop to their homeland 
for chefs belgian endives allure is that it does not fall 
apart in cooking farmers can charge top dollar because it requires 
a laborintensive growing process in which the white roots are 
harvested and then placed in pitchdark rooms to force the growth 
of the tender leaves

about the executive changes compared to other types of 
acquisitions of companies our turnover was very very low because

a creditor payback plan proposed by the bankrupt 
hunt brothers amounts to blackmail an attorney said friday 
during a hearing in the bankruptcy petitions of the two former 
billionaires 
willam herbert hunt and nelson bunker hunt filed bankruptcy last 
september after minpeco sa a peruvian mining company won a 1346 
million judgment against them minpeco claimed the brothers had 
conspired to commit fraud during their silver dealings in 1979 and 
1980 
the brothers also face multimillion dollar tax claims by the 
internal revenue service 
details of the brothers plan remained under seal until late 
friday but were discussed during a hearing before us bankruptcy 
judge harold abramson 
under the plan the hunt brothers largest creditor the irs 
would receive half of the proceeds from liquidation of assets over 
and above those set aside for the brothers 
the brothers each would retain 10 percent of the proceeds from 
the sale of their assets in bunker hunts case that 10 percent is 
estimated to be 15 million the brothers would also keep 
possession of their dallas homes and life interests in trusts 
left to them by their father hl hunt their other holdings would 
be liquidated and the proceeds split among about 4000 creditors 
each 
but major creditors including the irs minpeco and 
manufacturers hanover trust co of new york which has a 36 
million claim opposed the hunts plan 
the irs claim about 900 million against bunker hunt and 300 
million against his brother is the main sticking point in debt 
settlement negotiations 
a trial currently is scheduled for july on the irs contention 
that each brother owes 300 million in taxes from 1982 
they proposed blackmail to creditors said barbara howse a 
minpeco attorney criticizing the part of the hunts plan that 
includes proceeding to trial with the 1982 tax case 
should the brothers lose that case it would wipe out virtually 
all their assets leaving nothing for other creditors which 
include silver speculators and people who say they lost money in 
land deals involving the brothers 
the irs minpeco and manufacturers hanover together have 
proposed an outline of liquidation plan they would like other 
creditors to consider 
the major difference between the two plans according to 
manufacturers hanover attorney hugh ray involve who is in charge 
of the liquidation 
the real creditors dont want the hunts managing this ray 
said the question is who do you want running this the 
creditors who are owed the money or those who ran it into the 
ground 
we may not be sage we may not be wise but we can do better 
than this ray said 
the hunts asked abramson to extend the period that they alone 
may negotiate with creditors

the stock and bond markets rallied impressively after the 
government released economic data suggesting that inflationary 
pressures are subsiding and the economy is taking a breather from 
the brisk pace of the last few years 
on wall street the stock market turned in its best showing in 
nearly five months the dow jones industrial average jumped 4106 
points friday to 233706 for its best singleday gain since it 
rose 4392 points last oct 20 
in the credit markets bonds scored their biggest gains since 
early december the treasurys bellwether 30year issue jumped 
1250 for every 1000 in face amount as its yield dropped to 
903 percent from 915 percent late thursday shortterm interest 
rates were also sharply lower 
the government reported friday that wholesale prices climbed 
more slowly in march than in the previous two months while the 
operating rate at the nations factories slowed business 
inventories rose and sales plunged 
at the same time the government said the nations trade deficit 
widened in to 105 billion in february from a rtevised 898 
billion in january 
the reports were either better or consistent with expectations 
what we have here is what federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspan and the fed have been working for an economic 
pause that refreshes as opposed to a severe slowdown or 
recession said thomas f carpenter economist with asb capital 
management in washington 
the labor department reported that the producer price index of 
finished goods rose 04 percent in march the index which measures 
inflation at the wholesale level had increased 1 percent in each 
of the two previous months 
also in march the nations factories operated at an 84 percent 
rate 02 percent slower than in february and the second 
consecutive monthly decline according to the federal reserve board 
the commerce department said business inventories rose 05 
percent in february while sales plunged 09 percent in their 
steepest decline in more than two years 
with the exception of the trade figure analysts said the 
reports pointed to a slowdown in the growth of economic activity 
and fit in with other evidence that the economy is easing off the 
vigorous pace of recent years including lackluster retail sales 
and a slackening of employment growth in march 
we expect a slowdown in the economy and possibly a resurgence 
in growth later this year at that point people will be concerned 
about the economy again but now with the economy slowdown being 
confirmed with retail sales and other numbers the pendulum is 
beginning to swing back to a more balanced view and less 
inflationary fears said marshall b front economist at the 
chicago investment and mutualfund management firm of stein roe amp 
farnham 
carpenter cautioned however that it is premature to get on 
the bandwagon and suggest that the economy is going to slow in a 
meaningful way with most of the weakness concentrated in the 
automobile sector the slowdown could be temporary as dealers add 
incentives during the second quarter to help boost sales he said 
but fridays data could fuel a reversal in interest rates 
predicted peter greenbaum bond market analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co how much lower depends on what happens with 
the dollar greenbaum said he expects the yield on the 
governments longterm bond to decline to 875 percent by the end 
of the year from a peak of about 95 percent in the first quarter 
in other economic news a federal home loan mortgage corp 
survey showed that fixedrate home mortgages are currently 
averaging 1111 percent up from 1107 percent last week 
on oneyear adjustable rate mortgages lenders were asking an 
average initial rate of 941 percent this week up from 939 
percent the week before freddie mac said

american airlines fresh from a recent airplane 
buying binge and already casting an eye toward troubled eastern 
airlines found itself the target of informational pickets at 
numerous airports friday as union members began clamoring for a 
piece of the companys profits 
american has become the biggest carrier in the country they 
are the most profitable in the country and the workers weve 
worked hard youve made a lot of money off our labor and we want 
to share in that profit said jim gannon a spokesman for the 
transport workers union which represents 22000 of americans 
67000 employees 
union officials said a couple of hundred pickets were at 
americans home terminal at dallasfort worth international 
airport while a similar number were at ohare in chicago small 
numbers were reported at other airports where american operates 
the pickets did not disrupt the airlines flight schedule 
in new york meanwhile about 100 mechanics and ground service 
workers demanding a new contract picketed americans terminal at 
kennedy international airport port authority police said 
the unions contract with american was up for renewal on march 
1 but a proposed new pact was turned down by a 12143to5140 
vote last month 
the company and union will sit down next week with federal 
mediator harry bickford in an attempt to resolve the dispute which 
centers on wage scales and health benefits 
if no agreement is reached and bickford declares an impasse 
there is then a 30day cooling off period after which the union 
can strike and the company impose new contract conditions 
ed koziatek twus international vice president for american 
said he was not optimistic the mediation will be successful 
we spent eight weeks in direct negotiations and the parties 
are locked up on some real major concerns he said 
were frankly puzzled at the unions decision to picket 
american spokeswoman mary oneal said 
the rejected contract was worth 610 million over four years 
more than anyone has offered for example to buy eastern 
airlines ms oneal said 
it guaranteed raises for all employees ranging from about 28 
percent over four years to about 100 percent during the contract 
that seems pretty generous she said 
gannon said the union objected to the wage scale under which it 
takes new employees 12 years to reach top pay the union wants that 
reduced to five years 
also at issue he said is the companys plan to have employees 
pay 10 per person and up to 30 per family toward health 
insurance each month the company previously has paid the entire 
premium 
ms oneal said the company was asking only for employees to pay 
a part of increases with rising health costs the change is 
inevitable for all employees at american she said 
fort worthbased american just completed its most profitable 
year ever with parent company amr corp posting 1988 net income of 
4768 million a 1403 percent increase from 1987 and 379 percent 
higher than the previous record of 3458 million in 1985 
american president robert crandall said in miami thursday his 
airline was considering buying some routes belonging to eastern 
airlines which has filed for bankruptcy after a machinists strike 
essentially grounded the carrier 
last month american also announced two plane purchases a 309
