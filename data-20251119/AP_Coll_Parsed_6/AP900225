california attorney general john van de 
kamp formally launched his campaign for governor sunday in rival 
dianne feinsteins political backyard with a scathing attack on her 
record as mayor of san francisco 
van de kamp began with a rally at the mission high school boys 
gymnasium in the heart of the city where feinstein served nine 
years as mayor and ripped into feinsteins fiscal management and 
her record on civil rights insurance the environment and womens 
issues 
dianne feinsteins budget mismanagement turned the city by the 
bay into the city that could not pay van de kamp said accusing 
her of being evasive on how she would balance the state budget 
van de kamp describing himself as a candidate who is going to 
change california with environmental political ethics and drug 
reforms 
a spokesman for feinstein called van de kamps attack a sign of 
desperation in the wake of the most recent poll on the june 5 
democratic primary in which the former mayor pulled ahead of the 
attorney general 
the kickoff announcement is only a formality since van de kamp 
like feinstein has been actively campaigning for a year and leads 
feinstein in fund raising by 46 million to 23 million 
the winner of their june 5 primary will face the expected 
republican nominee us sen pete wilson in november incumbent 
gov george deukmejian a republican is retiring 
van de kamps campaign for governor is tied closely to three 
ballot initiatives he is sponsoring on the environment legislative 
ethics and crime the content of van de kamps initiatives has also 
stirred controversy part of his crime initiative duplicates an 
initiative sponsored by wilson except for deletion of privacy 
language which van de kamp claims could undermine a womans right 
to abortion and his political ethics initiative contains a 
controversial limit on the terms of legislators 
the ethics proposal has strained van de kamps relations with 
legislative leaders of his own party not only because of the 
proposed limit on their terms but especially because of a 
supporting article van de kamp wrote in which he said of the 
legislature if we want clean government its time to drain the 
swamp 
van de kamp 54 is a member of the wealthy pasadena family 
which formerly owned the frozen food company and the southern 
california bakery chain which still carry the family name 
before his election as attorney general in 1982 van de kamp 
served seven years as los angeles county district attorney five 
years as federal public defender and two years as assistant federal 
public defender in los angeles

nicaraguans voted sunday in a 
peaceful orderly manner key international observers said 
it was very fair former president jimmy carter told the 
associated press after the polls closed 
the head of the un 230member observer mission agreed 
i think things have been going very smoothly said former 
us attorney general elliot richardson he said none of the un 
observers deployed nationwide had reported irregularities in the 
voting 
carter richardson and organization of american states 
secretarygeneral joao baena soares also were monitoring the 
counting of the votes 
observers from smaller missions said they were more than 
satisfied with what theyd seen 
we have been out touring polling places since 545 am and we 
havent seen a single irregularity said guatemalan congressman 
edmond mullet 
mullet was one of 20 observers from the washingtonbased center 
for democracy which monitored the 1986 elections in the philipines 
and the 1989 elections in panama for the us senate 
erin saberi of the southwest voters registration project said 
she was impressed with the seriousness with which people exercised 
their franchise 
political agreements between the ruling sandinista government 
the domestic opposition and central american countries laid the 
groundwork for what has been not only nicaraguas freest election 
but also one of the worlds most closely observed 
there were so many observers monitoring the voting that one 
group decided to observe other observers 
the supreme electoral council said it had issued credentials for 
more than 3000 international observers or one for every 550 or so 
registered voters 
its great for nicaragua to have all these people spending all 
these dollars said humberto s dona as he stood in line to vote 
there are some people who say we should have an election every 
year 
carter perhaps the single most crucial observer was at a 
polling place at 6 am a hour before opening time to watch 
preparations for the vote 
the quality is very high said carter in heavily accented 
spanish we need an election like this in the united states 
at the instituto loyola the biggest precinct in nicaragua 
voters waiting in line mistook the horde of reporters accompanying 
carter for international observers 
observers observers people shouted let them in let 
them in 
they broke into cheers whistles and applause when guards 
relented and opened the doors 
members of the biggest observer teams 230 people from the un 
and 430 from the oas seemed to be everywhere 
the oas and un missions have been in nicaragua for months as 
part of a monitoring effort that spanned voter registration and 
campaigning to balloting and counting the vote 
but since neither the oas nor the united nations planned to 
issue a quick assessment carters verdict took on even more weight 
a victory without his endorsement he said saturday would be 
hollow 
carter played a key role last year in panama publicly 
denouncing election fraud while the votes were still being counted 
his group includes a dozen senators and congressmen 
carter baena soares and richardson the personal representative 
of un chief javier perez de cuellar all praised the safeguards 
in place for the voting on the eve of the election 
one of those safeguards a nearly indelible blue ink turned out 
to be flawed but richardson discounted the importance of the fact 
that it could be removed with laundry bleach 
i dont think its fraud he told the associated press it 
would have to be a pretty elaborate scheme 
competing political parties also had observers stationed at the 
polls and in the regional and national votecounting centers 
the un and oas teams include everyone from political analysts 
to statisticians to communications technicans 
the smaller observer groups span the political spectrum 
in a scenario reminiscent of mad magazines spy vs spy one 
liberal group bostonbased hemisphere initiatives decided to 
monitor observers from the more conservative center for democracy 
after nicaraguas leftist government refused to issue visas for 
more than a score of center for democracy observers its president 
allen weinstein questioned the credibility of the entire election 
monitoring effort 
hemispheres president ralph fine said some of his people were 
observing the center observers so they could set the record 
straight if need be

president bush said sunday that whoever 
wins the election in nicaragua will find a better climate 
with the united states so long as the balloting is certified as 
free and fair and the resulting government maintains a democratic 
system 
fair elections would be very very helpful even if the 
sandinista government wins sundays balloting bush said 
the united states has supported political and military 
opposition to the daniel ortegas sandinista government and bush 
said he thought victory by the opposition would be for the best 
meanwhile nbc news reported the bush administration already has 
had direct highlevel contacts with the sandinistas making it 
clear the united states would open the door to normalizing 
relations if the sandinistas fulfilled certain conditions 
nbc said both sides agreed to basic terms including 
certifiably free and fair elections cessation of arms export by 
the sandinistas to leftist guerrillas in the region and increased 
democracy in nicaragua 
according to the report bush would resume official highlevel 
talks allow the current us economic embargo to expire and resume 
normal diplomatic relations 
asked about high level talks between us and nicaraguan 
officials bush attending an official dinner with the nations 
governors sunday night said better not be i dont believe 
it 
asked about former president carters criticism that the us 
role in nicaragua has not been constructive in recent yeras bush 
said only interesting 
on another topic bush said his upcoming meeting in palm springs 
fla with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu is very 
improtant now that hes solidfied his position the united 
states as fascinated as we are with changes in europe and even 
south america does not want to send a signal to our friends in the 
pacific that we are neglecting them 
in addition bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for 
latin american affairs denied direct contacts between highlevel 
us and nicaraguan officials 
he said that while us embassy officials in managua talk daily 
to the sandinista government the only contact of the level nbc 
reported was made last novemeber when the organization of the 
american states sponsored talks in washington between the contras 
and sandinistas aimed at reinstating a ceasefire in the contra 
war 
the notion theres been some kind of negotiations or quid pro 
quo dealing with postelection agreements is just total 
fantasy aronson said in a telephone interview 
he noted that secretary of state james a baker iii has publicly 
stated that in the event of a sandinista victory the united states 
would consider normalizing relations if the election is fair the 
sandinistas stop exporting revolution and show commitment to 
democratic principles 
aronson speculated that the managua government is falsely 
telling reporters it has made agreements with highlevel us 
officials to bolster ortegas election bid 
this is just an effort to make the sandinistas look like 
winners he said 
despite his difficulties with the sandinista government bush 
earlier said let me say this if these elections are certifiably 
free and fair whoever wins the election will find a better climate 
in which to improve relations with nicaragua 
asked earlier what the us policy would be if ortega the 
sandinista leader was kept in power in the historic nicaraguan 
voting bush said he would not accept the premise of the questions 
he also refused to talk extensively about nicaragua for fear it 
might influence the balloting then under way 
but he said the government that wins the elections must prove it 
supports democracratic principles there has got to be a period 
of establishing bona fides he said 
while elections are important what follows in terms of 
freedom of the press freedom of institutions there freedom to 
protest freedom to speak their mind is also crucial he said 
i would love to see nicaragua living peacefully within its own 
borders not trying to subvert its neighbors and giving its people 
a shot at democracy he said 
once all that was sorted out i can guarantee you that there 
would be better relations with nicaragua he said

the national institutes of health is 
investigating allegations that the aids virus first discovered in 
the united states six years ago is the same virus discovered nearly 
a year before in france a newspaper reported 
the inquiry also is examining much of the related research 
conducted in recent years by dr robert c gallo the nations most 
prominent aids researcher according to the report published in 
sunday editions of the chicago tribune 
gallos laboratory at the national cancer institute in bethesda 
md reported discovery of the virus in may 1984 it was alleged 
that gallo accidentally or deliberately claimed the first sample of 
the virus isolated in france as his own 
the scientist is quoted in the current issue of science magazine 
as welcoming an inquiry into questions about his research 
these allegations have been going on too long gallo said in 
science i have done nothing wrong and i have no apprehension or 
anxiety about the review 
at issue is gallos recognition as codiscoverer with a team of 
scientists from the pasteur institute in paris of the human 
immunodeficiency virus known as hiv which most scientists believe 
causes aids 
the achievement has earned him numerous scientific honors and 
prizes and more than 300000 in personal royalties made from the 
blood test with the gallo virus 
another potential issue is the ultimate ownership of the patent 
now held jointly by the us government and pasteur on the test 
that has been used to check millions of individuals and units of 
stored blood plasma for exposure to the aids virus 
the us and french governments in 1987 settled a longrunning 
dispute when franch agreed to drop a lawsuit on the patent and the 
two nations set up a plan for sharing proceeds 
domestic sales of the test are estimated at 175 million a year 
the tribune said the nih started its probe nov 29 10 days 
after the newspaper published an article that recounted the history 
of hiv and raised questions about the accuracy of gallos published 
research 
to assist the nih investigation dr william raub the 
institutes acting director has asked the national academy of 
sciences to help assemble an advisory panel of scientists from 
outside the government with expertise in virology and related 
fields 
nih officials said friday that they had not yet received the 
names of any potential candidates the tribune reported 
an academy spokeswoman said she could not recall a previous 
request to assemble a panel of experts in a case of scientific 
misconduct the tribune said

its the time of year when winds over the south 
china sea blow north so hong kong is bracing for tens of thousands 
of vietnamese expected to set sail on the treacherous journey to 
its already overcrowded shores 
more than 35000 vietnamese swamped the british colony seeking 
asylum in 1989 if a similar wave of boat people arrives this year 
were going to be in trouble said mike hanson who coordinates 
government policy on boat people in hong kong 
about 55000 vietnamese already are languishing in hong kongs 
cramped prisonlike camps some will be resettled overseas as 
refugees but most will be deported as illegal immigrants because 
they cannot prove persecution back home 
on sunday local newspapers reported that a vietnamese refugee 
30yearold nguyen ho challenged the screening policy and appeals 
procedure by filing a lawsuit in the high court of hong kong on 
saturday government radio earlier said six refugees challenged the 
screening but it did not elaborate 
the new yorkbased lawyers committee for human rights said it 
helped prepare the lawsuit filed saturday and that more such action 
was forthcoming no court dates were given 
the refugee screening procedure that hong kong has used since 
june of 1988 is cursory and filled with potential for error the 
group said in a statement interviewers seem intent on 
establishing solely economic reasons for departure from vietnam 
even some people who have endured harsh reeducation programs or 
forced labor in vietnam have been rejected 
it will only take a few thousand more boat people to fill hong 
kongs existing camps to capacity then the government faces bleak 
options 
local lawmakers angered by the financial burden created by the 
boat people have delayed approval of a proposed 30 million 
detention center on a remote outlying island 
lacking new facilities hanson said the governments contingency 
plan calls for squeezing more vietnamese into the existing camps 
he conceded this would likely exacerbate tension in the camps 
where factional fighting is common and a handful of boat people 
facing repatriation have attempted suicide police in riot gear 
already have had to fire tear gas on several occasions to quell 
clashes 
other steps the government might have to take include placing 
new arrivals on ferries moored in the harbor which was done at the 
height of last years influx and erecting makeshift camps of 
little more than barbed wire enclosing flat space said a western 
diplomat who has been following developments 
the real crunch comes in july when youve run out of 
everything available and still they are coming said the 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
so far the government has resisted calls to push arriving boat 
people back out to sea but community pressure to take such action 
is sure to increase if this years influx is heavy 
it is impossible to estimate how many additional boat people 
will show up during the spring sailing season in hong kong a tiny 
territory on the south china coast about 500 miles northeast of the 
vietnamese port city of haiphong 
security secretary geoffrey barnes said he was encouraged that 
only 244 boat people had arrived this year through feb 22 a 45 
percent decline from the same period last year only eight of the 
1990 arrivals had sailed from northern vietnam the region from 
which most of last years boat people set sail 
barnes said the figures were too small to be regarded as 
significant but he attributed the decline in part to vietnamese 
efforts to prevent people from setting sail 
vietnamese officials in haiphong city and the northern province 
of quang ninh told the associated press in january of intensified 
efforts to apprehend organizers of sailing journeys to hong kong 
and to increase security along the coast 
they also have launched a media propaganda campaign to explain 
the tough living condition in the hong kong camps 
i think that the number of people that are going to leave 
vietnam will be limited to the minimum said hoang ngoc tri a 
haiphong official in charge of receiving repatriated boat people 
its very difficult to predict a figure but we want to stop 
it immediately absolutely all we can do is try our best he 
said 
hanson said one worrying development is that many of the 
vietnamese who have arrived in hong kong this year first traveled 
to china by land before setting sail the open border makes the 
trip very easy and very cheap he said 
he believes a key to keeping the influx to a minimum lies with 
continued repatriation of boat people against their will 
the hong kong government adopted a tough policy in june 1988 
under which boat people are considered illegal immigrants subject 
to repatriation unless they can show a wellfounded fear of 
persecution in their homeland 
an initial group of 51 boat people denied refugee status were 
sent home against their will in december although hanson believes 
the move had a deterrent effect no more vietnamese have been 
forced back since largely because of us demands they be given 
until next year to consider going home voluntarily 
the failure to get an international consensus on when to resume 
deportations has been distinctly unhelpful hanson said 
hanson believes that because washington delayed the deportation 
program it has a responsibility to help bear the cost of housing 
the boat people

tony conigliaro whose brilliant baseball career 
was cut short when he was hit in the face by a pitched ball at age 
22 died saturday of kidney failure the former boston red sox 
outfielder was 45 
vinnie martelli conigliaros uncle said conigliaro died at 
salem hospital in salem mass he entered the hospital thursday 
and had been in poor health since suffering a heart attack in 1982 
hes been in a bad way since the attack several years back 
martelli said he never quite recovered 
his mother theresa conigliaro said conigliaro required 
constant care after his heart attack 
we lost him after eight years hes never really been back 
mrs conigliaro said saturday the only consolation is he didnt 
know what he was going through 
red sox spokesman dick bresciani said it was a very tragic 
finish for tony the red sox are deeply saddened 
the man the fans called tony c was at age 22 the youngest 
major league player to hit 100 career home runs 
he was probably most widely known however for the beaning that 
tragically cost him his career on aug 18 1967 during a game 
with the california angels a pitch by jack hamilton hit conigliaro 
on the left side of the face leaving him with a fractured 
cheekbone a dislocated jaw and blurred vision 
the crowd fell silent at the sound of the pitch hitting 
conigliaros face recalled dick dew who was a sportswriter 
covering the game 
it stopped everybody in the place because of the sound of it 
it was unmistakable said dew you knew the injury was serious 
the moment you heard it 
conigliaro sat out the rest of the 1967 season and all of 1968 
with vision problems 
but in the fall of 1968 he attempted a comeback as a pitcher in 
the florida instructional league at age 23 his vision sharpened 
and the 1969 season found him back with the red sox in his familiar 
right field position 
at the end of the 1970 season conigliaro was traded to the 
angels after having belted 36 homers and driving in 116 runs both 
career highs 
citing recurring vision problems he retired after half a season 
with california the following year 
in 1975 conigliaro again attempted a comeback with boston but 
it ended after 21 games 
johnny pesky a former red sox coach who managed the team when 
conigliaro joined the club in 1964 said he was so good and you 
could see it you knew he was going to be a great player 
it was a shame he got hurt when he did pesky said of the 
pitching accident with a few more years he could have made the 
hall of fame 
after the heart attack pesky said he visited conigliaro several 
times 
when i went over to see tony id end up crying pesky said 
he was such a big strong kid you would have never thought that 
something like that could have happened 
born in revere mass on jan 7 1945 conigliaro made a splash 
as a rookie in 1964 when he hit 24 homers and batted 290 despite 
missing six weeks with two broken bones and other injuries 
a year later he led the american league with 32 homers a wrist 
fracture that sidelined him for 24 games kept him from hitting 
more still at age 20 he was the youngest major leaguer ever to 
win a home run crown 
his lifetime major league batting average was 264 with 516 
runs and 166 home runs 
after his baseball career ended at age 30 conigliaro worked as 
a sportscaster for television stations in providence ri and san 
francisco he also worked for a sports agents firm in los angeles 
and ran a health food store north of san francisco 
on jan 7 1982 conigliaro auditioned for a spot on the red sox 
telecasting team joseph dimino station manager of wsbktv said 
conigliaro had been a leading candidate for the job 
two days later conigliaro suffered a heart attack which put 
him in a coma for four months it also left him brain damaged and 
affected his speech 
he never recovered fully but was able to walk with the aid of a 
walker in his final years 
martelli said funeral arrangements were being planned

the launch of the shuttle atlantis 
on a secret military mission was scrubbed with 31 seconds left in 
the countdown early sunday following three days of delays caused 
by weather and the mission commanders health 
we have scrubbed for today said lisa malone the launch 
control center commentator 
nasa tentatively rescheduled the launch for monday at about 1 
am pending resolution of a computer problem that caused the 
postponement 
launch director bob sieck briefly considered trying to launch 
the craft which carries a spy satellite later sunday morning but 
after assessing all their options he and his aides decided they did 
not have enough time to reschedule it so soon 
the countdown had reached the 4minute mark when the range 
safety monitor team detected a problem with one of its computers 
the clock was counted down to 31 seconds a point where the 
spacecraft computer takes control and was held there while experts 
investigated the problem 
the range safety monitor is responsible for sending a radio 
signal to destroy the shuttle if it strays too far off course and 
threatens populated areas 
there are two range safety computers a primary and a backup 
and launch rules require both be operating officials said they 
said the backup failed but they did not know why 
they said that while the count was being held temperatures on 
the main engines became too cold forcing sieck to call off the 
effort for the day 
the five astronauts who had been lying on their backs in the 
spacecraft for nearly five hours departed the launch pad an hour 
after the scrub and returned to the crew quarters seven miles away 
prior to the lastminute scrub the clock had been stopped since 
wednesday but with the sky clear and navy capt john o creighton 
over his cold shuttle managers gave the goahead to pick up the 
count at midmorning for a sunday morning launch 
technicians pumped half a million gallons of volatile fuel 
consisting of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into atlantis 
tanks at midafternoon 
a van carrying the five astronauts drove past the press viewing 
area accompanied by security vehicles and a helicopter about 10 
pm an hour later the launch control center reported the 
astronauts were aboard the spaceship 
earlier a red team of four technicians moved onto the 
mobile launch platform to check out a problem with a fuel valve 
they found a leak fixed it and the countdown continued 
uninterrupted 
because the mission is classified the countdown and precise 
launch time are secret until the final nine minutes but nasa said 
liftoff would be between midnight and 4 am 
forecasters said hours before the planned launch that there was 
an 80 percent chance the weather would be favorable at launch time 
this was up from a 70 percent prediction made earlier in the day 
the shuttle was expected to fly northeastward a few hundred 
miles off the east coast if the weather was clear the launch 
could be visible for hundreds of miles as far north as new jersey 
weather officers said the temperature at launch time would be in 
the mid40s the coldest since challenger was launched in 36 
degrees on jan 28 1986 and exploded 73 seconds later after 
flames escaped through a joint in one of the two solid fuel booster 
rockets 
a presidential commission said the cold weather was a 
contributing factor because it prevented a rubber oring in the 
joint from sealing properly the joints have been redesigned and a 
heater has been added to each one 
nasa has said it would not now launch a shuttle in a temperature 
below 47 degrees if the wind were less than 6 mph the forecast was 
for winds of about 16 mph gusting to about 25 mph a higher wind 
is an advantage when temperatures dip because it keeps frost from 
forming 
atlantis launch path would put it in an orbit that reportedly 
would cover a greater area of the globe than any other shuttle so 
that the reconnaissance satellite once released by the fivemember 
crew can gather intelligence over northern areas of the soviet 
union where there are numerous military bases and missile sites 
creightons allmilitary crew includes air force col john h 
casper the pilot and three mission specialists marine lt col 
david c hilmers air force col richard mullane and navy lt cmdr 
pierre j thuot 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported that the 
astronauts were to deploy on the second day a 37300pound 500 
million spy satellite capable of taking supersharp photos and 
listening in on military and diplomatic communications around the 
world 
in covring most of the soviet union the satellite would be 
important in verifying soviet compliance with current arms 
agreements and others still being negotiated 
nasa and the pentagon planned to maintain a news blackout 
throughout the flight unless there was a major problem two 
announcements were planned one about three hours after liftoff to 
report that orbital operations had begun and another 30 hours into 
the flight with the date and time of landing 
the flight was expected to last four days with landing at 
edwards air force base calif 
military officials said the secrecy surrounding defense 
department shuttle flights is necessary to make it more difficult 
for soviet reconnaissance satellites and spy ships off cape 
canaveral to track the spacecraft 
critics argue that soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly 
already know a great deal about atlantis mission and that once 
the shuttle is in orbit they will be able to track it precisely 
and know what it is doing 
it will be the sixth classified military mission and fourth 
afterdark launch in 34 shuttle missions

a rising demand for oil could push oil prices up 
by 50 percent in the next five years a published report said 
the cost of oil could rise from the present average of 20 a 
barrel to 30 a barrel by 1995 oil executives and analysts told 
the new york times 
opec nations may not be able to pump enough oil to meet the 
growing call from east asia and newly independent eastern european 
nations the experts said 
expectations for increased demand come as output in the united 
states and the soviet union is declining according to the report 
in saturdays editions of the times 
by 1995 it is more than likely that we would have 30 oil 
said mehdi varzi chief of energy research at kleinwort benson 
securities in london 
the swiftness of the increase will catch a lot of people by 
surprise he said 
there are a lot of imponderables but i would say the risk of 
oil prices spiking is greater now than at any time in the last 10 
years said george f friesen an analyst at the deutsche bank 
capital corp in new york he also expected the price per barrel 
will reach 30 in five years 
about two dozen executives securities analysts and economists 
agreed that oil prices could rise faster than had been predicted 
six months ago 
a few disagreed arguing that middle eastern producers of oil 
would be able to expand production to meet the demand and that 
many nations are taking steps to reduce their demand for oil

sandro pertini a highly popular former socialist 
president of italy and world war ii hero died saturday night at 
age 93 the italian media reported 
the blunttalking pertini imprisoned by the fascist government 
during the war served in the largely ceremonial presidential post 
from 1978 to 1985 while italy defeated urban terrorism and moved to 
become one of the worlds economic powers 
the italian news agency ansa said pertini died in his sleep 
after dining with his wife carla in their apartment facing the 
famous trevi fountain in central rome 
the exact cause of death was not immediately known but pertini 
had not been well since early this month after he fell in the 
apartment and hit his head 
pertini had expressed the desire to die at home and not be 
admitted to a hospital he had asked for a private funeral at his 
birthplace in northern italy followed by cremation 
francesco cossiga who succeeded pertini in the presidency paid 
a halfhour visit to the apartment sunday morning 
pertini elected by parliament after giovani leone was forced to 
resign during a scandal was credited with boosting the morale of 
italians during the dark days of terrorism and instilling a sense 
of pride 
born in the italian riviera town of savona on sept 25 1896 
pertini studied law and political science before fighting in world 
war i 
in 1916 he helped found the socialist party in italy with pietro 
nenni but he never allowed himself to be restricted by party lines 
during the rise of fascism after world war i pertini was 
imprisoned but managed to escape to france in 1929 during the 
regime of dictator benito mussolini he was captured in northern 
italy and sentenced again 
pertini spent nearly 10 years in mussolinis prisons before he 
escaped again to lead a resistance movement in northern italy the 
nazis sentenced him to death in 1943 but again he escaped and 
became socialist party secretary in 1945 
pertini was elected to parliament after the wars end and 
reelected continually in the decades that followed serving two 
terms as president of the chamber of deputies for a while he 
edited the party newspaper lavanti 
his independent line made him acceptable to an array of parties 
of the left and right and as twoterm president of the lower house 
of parliament from 1968 to 1975 he was a noted mediator whenever 
tempers flared in the chamber 
pertini had hoped to win the presidency in 1971 but lost to the 
christian democrat leone after leones fall and the assassination 
of aldo moro whom many believed to be next in line for the 
presidency pertini emerged as a compromise candidate after 15 
ballots in parliament 
he immediately brought an open style to the post refusing to 
live in the pomp of the quirinal palace on the advice of his 
independentminded wife 
the couple who had no children kept their apartment 
overlooking the trevi fountain and during his frequent walks to 
work or his favorite cafe pertini often stopped to talk to 
passersby a nightmare for his security detail 
the elegantly dressed whitehaired dignitary enjoyed joking 
about his agehis gallantry to women and his spontaneity with 
journalists were proverbial 
he irked some parliamentarians by his use of presidential powers 
that had previously been neglected 
in 1979 he employed his littleused authority as head of the 
armed forces to end a strike by air traffic controllers who worked 
for the military at the time 
when political bickering caused the downfall of prime minister 
giovanni spadolinis coalition in august 1982 pertini angrily 
expressed the nations exasperation when he told reporters they 
have ruined my vacation he then called the partners together and 
convinced them to accept an identical government for another try 
receiving palestinian leader yassir arafat in rome in 1982 he 
vigorously supported the palestinian claim for a homeland but with 
the same ardor vowed to combat antisemitism in italy 
pertini often demonstrated his affection for the united states 
in speeches and welcoming toasts recalling us aid during and 
after world war ii when he visited the united states in 1982 he 
kissed the american flag and exchanged an emotional greeting with 
president reagan 
pertini formed a friendship with pope john paul ii and kept a 
vigil outside the pontiffs hospital room after john paul was shot 
in may 1981

thousands of police and troops turned out sunday 
to control masses of prodemocracy demonstrators in the soviet 
capital but first indications were that many heeded official 
warnings and stayed away 
rumors of impending violence swirled around plans for nationwide 
demonstrations on sunday and for days in advance authorities 
warned of danger and appealed for responsible action 
thousands of people gathered on the broad garden ring road in 
front of the soviet foreign ministry and thousands more marched 
peacefully along the road that encircles the downtown area 
were fed up with how we live said one moscow demonstrator 
celestine langovaya a music teacher in her 50s when mikhail 
s gorbachev first came to power i believed in him but things 
have gotten worse for millions of people 
gorbachev who came to power in 1985 has been attacked by 
communist hardliners and reformists alike for political and 
economic perestroika or restructuring that has yet to bring 
prosperity 
in leningrad riot police thwarted an unsanctioned 
demonstration dragging people aboard waiting buses before the 
protest began 
members of the democratic union a selfstyled opposition 
political party were surrounded by about 100 uniformed police as 
they prepared to stage their protest in a city square 
a senior police officer speaking through a megaphone ordered the 
people to disperse saying their demonstration was not sanctioned 
by authorities about a dozen whitehelmeted riot police in 
bulletproof vests then dragged wouldbe protesters away and loaded 
them onto buses 
among those taken into custody were two candidates in local 
elections to be held march 4 in the baltic port city the two were 
later released 
one protester climbed atop a metal construction crane and 
unfurled a yellow cloth banner that read boycott its your 
first step to freedom the demonstrator showered leaflets 
repeating the message on people below before five policemen climbed 
the crane and dragged him away 
the interior ministry which includes riot squads and police 
canceled days off sunday and said it was placing onethird more 
police on duty nationwide during the rallies 
in moscow alone 17000 police officers were to be on duty 
officials said saturday 
the government has in recent days called for calm and restraint 
amid rumors that violence could break out during sundays planned 
rallies and counterdemonstrations hundreds of thousands of people 
in cities across the nation were expected to turn out 
several demonstrations were canceled because organizers feared 
violence or official reprisals 
the demonstrations grew out of the success of a protest feb 4 
when tens of thousands of people paraded through moscow demanding 
the communist party give up its grip on power 
three days later the party central committee voted to renounce 
its constitutional monopoly on power 
sunday is also the anniversary of the february revolution 
the 1917 populist uprising that drove czar nicolas ii from the 
throne for many russian progressives opposed to the communist 
party it marks the the shortlived triumph of russian democracy 
the bolsheviks seized power eight months later 
during the leningrad incident associated press photographer 
dominique mollard was grabbed by uniformed police as he took 
pictures he was taken to a bus where police checked his 
documents informed him the demonstration was unsanctioned and 
released him 
earlier in the week authorities told prodemocracy groups that 
wanted to demonstrate in leningrad they would not be permitted to 
hold their rally on the streets but would have to assemble inside a 
sports complex the groups refused and announced they would not 
hold any demonstrations in the city

protesters shouting antigovernment 
and antius slogans tried to stone a us diplomats residence 
sunday in the southern city of kwangju and clashed with police in 
four other cities reports and witnesses said 
police fired tear gas to break up the protests by students and 
dissidents in kwangju inchon taegu pusan and taejon and arrested 
some 100 people about 3000 people were involved the protests 
reports said 
about 50 students chanting yankee go home were stopped 
about 10 yards from the main gate of the residence of carlton ames 
director of the us cultural center in kwangju on sunday morning 
reported the south korean news agency yonhap 
about 40 riot police fired tear gas to disperse the students 
and two bottles of red paint were hurled at the gate of the kwangju 
mayors house across the street as the protesters fled yonhap said 
it was not known if ames was home at the time of the incident or 
if there was any damage to his residence police said there were no 
arrests or injuries 
almost simultaneously two separate groups of about 30 radicals 
attempted to attack two police substations in kwangju but also were 
dispersed by tear gas firing police said yonhap 
radical students hurling rocks and firebombs later fought police 
in two areas of kwangju for about 30 minutes yonhap said it said 
the students protested the dictatorial merger last month of 
president roh taewoos governing party with two centrist 
opposition groups 
radicals and dissidents a small but vocal minority claim the 
new giant governing party is a return to authoritarian control and 
a ploy to stall democratization 
kwangju 150 miles south of seoul is the stronghold of 
opposition leader kim daejung whose party for peace and democracy 
was left isolated as a result of the merger 
antius sentiment in kwangju is strong because of belief among 
its citizens that washington condoned the harsh military crackdown 
on a prodemocracy movement in the city in 1980 which resulted in 
some 200 people killed and more than 1500 others injured 
the us cultural center in kwangju was temporarily closed last 
may after having been attacked 28 times since 1980 us officials 
have indicated they would open the center this summer

the us invasion of panama succeeded not 
only because the enemy was outnumbered and outgunned but because 
the attack was carried out primarily by one branch of the service 
say three former combat commanders 
the singleservice philosophy was shunned in the failed iran 
rescue mission and the attack on grenada 
the military didnt make grenada mistakes in panama because 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff made it an 
army show said retired col david h hackworth said you 
didnt have everybody getting their share of the action for the 
glory train afterward 
in grenada everybody was trying to get a piece of the pie 
retired lt gen henry e emerson agreed in a recent interview 
the 1983 invasion of the caribbean island of grenada and the 
hostage rescue mission in 1980 that left the iranian desert strewn 
with wrecked us aircraft were joint operations of all the 
services that experts say suffered from blurred command lines and 
poor coordination 
the grenada invasion although successful in ousting a leftist 
regime required more than 7000 soldiers to subdue about 700 cuban 
construction workers and soldiers 
grenada which was planned in two days was a military comic 
opera characterized by bad intelligence critical equipment 
breakdowns and tactical blunders hackworth said in a telephone 
interview from his home in maleny australia 
a report by the congressional military reform caucus said an 
early plan for the grenada strike calling for the use of only navy 
and marine forces was overruled by the joint chiefs of staff who 
demanded that all four services be involved just as in the iran 
rescue mission 
the dec 20 assault on panama that ousted dictator manuel 
noriega was planned and polished for months the 13000 us troops 
based in panama were at wellstocked bases and provided 
intelligence on the panamanian defense forces and protection for 
the 14000 invading troops 
because most of the troops were from the army the only others 
were two companies of marines and 20 navy seal commandos the 
invading force had the advantage of a streamlined command structure 
and uniform procedures 
harold g moore also a retired lieutenant general who like 
hackworth and emerson was an infantry commander in korea and 
vietnam said unity of command was exercised very efficiently and 
effectively in panama 
the attack by light infantry units rangers and 3000 
paratroopers making the largest combat drop since world war ii 
staggered the pdf soldiers many of whom ran away 
they went in with sufficient force to overwhelm them said 
hackworth psychologically in battle this is a very important 
thing 
powells influence on the planning and execution was evident 
said hackworth and emerson who retired in 1977 and lives in 
helena mont 
i see powell as a quiet military reformer he knows how to 
make reforms diplomatically said hackworth one of the nations 
most decorated soldiers who broke with the army in 1971 when he 
publicly criticized the use of conventional tactics to fight a 
guerrilla war in vietnam 
hackworth said the militarys performance in panama demonstrated 
that the us army has greatly recovered from the trauma of 
vietnam the army has taken remedial action to get itself 
straightened out 
nevertheless the officers cautioned the army against glorying 
too much in its panama success 
it was a very very easy operation a very very soft 
target said hackworth who holds two distinquished service 
crosses nine silver stars eight bronze stars and eight purple 
hearts 
i feel the operation could have been done by 100 special 
forces guys who could have gotten noriega this big operation was a 
pentagon attempt to impress congress just when theyre starting to 
cut back on the military 
moore noted also that 23 american soldiers died in the attack 
there are 23 families whose lives and hearts were shattered he 
said 
moore and hackworth said the principal flaw in the invasion was 
the loss of surprise huge c141 transport planes were landing at 
10minute intervals at howard air force base in panama city as the 
invasion hour approached 
it seemed to me that the operation was compromised when it 
started moore said from his home in auburn ala

the first of three social workers goes on 
trial monday on charges of failing to report suspected child abuse 
before the death of a toddler who allegedly was dunked in the 
toilet for soiling his pants 
until the death july 28 of 2yearold bradley mcgee state 
childprotection workers in florida had never been criminally 
charged for their handling of a case 
kenneth houk 39 is the first of the department of health and 
rehabilitative services workers set for trial in the case which 
focused attention on abuse and its reporting and prompted more 
spending on child welfare 
the blond blueeyed lakeland boy came into state custody as a 
newborn when his mother abandoned him to a woman she barely knew 
who sold pretzels at a mall 
hrs eventually gave the boy back to his mother two months 
later he suffered fatal head injuries from being repeatedly shoved 
headfirst into a toilet and beaten with pillows for soiling his 
pants authorities say 
his mother and stepfather sheryl mcgee coe 21 and thomas coe 
22 are charged with murder and aggravated child abuse and face 
trial this summer 
hrs program administrator houk case worker margaret barber 
case worker shirley duboise and supervisor judy ross were charged 
with failing to report child abuse an offense punishable by up to 
60 days in jail 
prosecutors two weeks ago dropped the charges against ms ross 
saying she was incorrectly identified as having received a report 
of suspected abuse on the boy 
ms barber who directly supervised the mcgee case was also 
charged with child abuse which carries up to five years in prison 
the bottom line is that the tools rules and procedures were 
in place to save bradleys life and they were not used said the 
hrs report on which the charges were based 
weeks before bradleys death houk and barber received calls 
that his mother had forced him to eat feces for soiling his 
diapers but they did not call hrs abuse hot line to report the 
incident as required investigators said 
in december 1988 according to the hrs probe houk received a 
call contending the mother was unfit because she was drinking and 
using cocaine houk did not call the hotline the investigation 
found 
in both instances houk contended he acted in good faith by 
telling the caller to notify the toddlers case worker 
further trials could bring out other allegations among them 
that ms barber knew a psychological evaluation concluded the coes 
were incapable of ever being good parents yet never told the 
judge who gave the toddler back to his family 
attorneys for the indicted hrs workers have maintained that they 
performed their jobs in good faith and were under tremendous 
stress the hrs inspector noted that ms barber was handling 47 
cases when 20 was considered a full load 
in november all the defendants except ms barber were offered a 
plea bargain to dispose of the case for a 100 fine they refused 
opting instead for trials to clear their name 
these charges were brought for pure grandstanding purposes 
hrs spokesman steve konicki said recently 
houk ms barber 61 and ms ross 46 returned to hrs after 
suspensions ms duboise 43 resigned and faces trial next month 
no date is set for ms barbers trial

tar balls washing up on east coast 
beaches may be the legacy of a longago war and longlost oil 
tankers a reminder of yesterdays pollution at a time when 
todays spills have the nation on guard 
a halfcentury ago german uboats stalking their prey close by 
the us gulf and east coasts sank 148 petroleum tankers and 
countless other ships spilling or sending to the ocean bottom 
millions of gallons of oil and gasoline 
recent big spills off alaska and california recall those world 
war ii disasters and invite a basic question what has been the 
lasting impact 
the government studied the pollution potential two decades after 
the war and judged it to be minor but conclusive answers still 
remain sketchy 
nazi germany unleashed its uboats in january 1942 weeks after 
the united states entered world war ii unarmed ships traveling 
along the east and gulf coasts sometimes silhouetted by shore 
lights at night were sitting ducks 
in his 1978 book uboats offshore when hitler struck 
america edwin p hoyt estimated that in one month in early 1942 
five german submarines cost the allies hundreds of thousands of 
gallons of gasoline 
on feb 19 1942 the tanker pan massachusetts was sunk off cape 
canaveral followed by the sinking of the cities service empire 
the republic and the w d anderson along the florida coast off 
jupiter and palm beach 
the night prowlers soon grew bolder on may 7 near jupiter 
inlet a uboat torpedoed the amazon in daylight the same day in 
the same area the halsey and the java arrow went down the three 
tankers carried 76 million gallons of petroleum said joe pickett 
a historian at mayport naval station 
the amount of petroleum carried by world war ii tankers was 
relatively small when compared with modern tankers like the exxon 
valdez which was carrying 53 million gallons of crude when it went 
aground last march 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons off 
alaska 
oil spills were reported up and down the coast during the war 
oil washing ashore was a nuisance for florida tourists and a 
headache for resort operators but there is no evidence any major 
cleanup efforts were undertaken 
the national focus was on the war effort not on the 
environment in fact the government censored information on such 
sinkings 
in an april 1942 story on a ship sinking off jacksonville beach 
witnessed by crowds attending a dance the florida timesunion said 
newspapers were requested to withhold the name of the ship its 
tonnage cargo and ports of departure and destination 
the uboat threat gradually subsided as us forces adopted 
better evasive and antisubmarine tactics 
environmental officials agree the world war ii spills without 
doubt caused shortterm damage and in some cases sensitive shore 
areas may have been permanently damaged or destroyed 
but as one specialist noted oil usually degrades over two to 
three years 
thats not to say that we want oil spills in the environment 
because theres always a certain amount of toxicity said the 
specialist fred stroud a senior onsite coordinator for oil 
spills for the us environmental protection agency 
oil can be devastating to mangrove stands and coral reefs like 
those in south florida said stroud who is based in atlanta 
a spill can also harm seabirds and colonies of oysters clams 
and shrimp in oceanside marshes although stroud said the shellfish 
usually recover within three years but if it is serious enough 
they may not bounce back he said 
temperatures and natural ocean action aid the degradation 
process he said in warm temperatures such light products as 
gasoline evaporate and oil degrades quickly heavy oil sinks to the 
bottom in the form of sticky tar 
many tar balls that wash up on the beaches of florida and the 
rest of the southeast could be the result of slow leakage from some 
of the germansunk tankers stroud said 
in alaska however the cold has slowed the degradation of the 
exxon valdez spill explained the epa official 
the federal government in 1967 studied the potential pollution 
threat from the world war ii sinkings 
coast guard divers examined four tankers sunk in less than 200 
feet of water off new york and new jersey and found tanks mostly 
emptied of oil in some cases apparently because of seepage in 
others apparently because of the original torpedoing or metal 
corrosion 
at the site of the sunken british tanker coimbra 30 miles 
southeast of fire island ny intermittent oil seepage was 
observed on the surface of the water but its source could not be 
located the report stated 
nevertheless the study concluded evidence gathered from this 
project indicates that tankers sunk during world war ii do not 
present a potential pollution threat to the american coastline

we know were at sea with cocaine treatment said dr john 
p morgan director of the pharmacology department at city 
university of new york medical school the truth is were at sea 
with most drug programs 
rick harwood of the office of national drug control policy led 
by william j bennett gave a more optimistic assessment saying 
treatment helps even without any known cure but he acknowledged 
that cocaine addiction is a special problem 
theres recidivism with every kind of drug use but more with 
cocaine than with heroin people using amphetamines marijuana pcp 
or a variety of other things harwood said recently 
harwood said researchers are trying to develop medications to 
control the craving but they are not yet ready for use in 
addition bennetts office is trying to get congress to approve 
rules that would require treatment facilities to provide data that 
would reveal what efforts produce success 
the nations largest alcohol and drug treatment chain 
careunit run by compcare corp of st louis recently conducted a 
study of recovery rates for its patients the study deemed a 
patient recovered if he or she either had abstained from all 
mindaltering substances for at least a full year or had abstained 
for at least six months and was abstinent when the survey was taken 
and the relapse was limited said ken estes a spokesman for the 
national association of addiction treatment providers 
the overall recovery rate for cocaine abusers was 54 percent 
careunit found but that rate dropped to 34 percent for those who 
had remained abstinent for a full year estes said 
by comparison for patients using a single substance alcohol 
in most cases the recovery rate was 66 percent estes said 
careunit is an inpatient facility where the average length of 
stay is about 22 days with followup care involving group therapy 
sessions at the clinic once a week for six months supplemented by 
attendance at alcoholics anonymous narcotics anonymous or cocaine 
anonymous meetings estes said 
the national drug control strategy that the bush administration 
issued last september said drug addiction treatment often works 
and it cited a major study of users who received treatment for 
three months or longer 
about half of those treated for cocaine or heroin addiction 
were not using these drugs one year later and an additional 20 to 
30 percent had reduced their drug use about half of those who 
remain a year or longer in a residential treatment program stay off 
drugs for at least seven years 
however the strategy notes that treatment for many works only 
partially or not at all like other chronic diseases drug 
addiction has no permanent cure and relapse is always a real 
possibility for those who have undergone treatment 
for fiscal 1991 the bush administration is seeking 15 billion 
for treatment efforts a 12 percent increase over the 13 billion 
to be spent this year that will include 183 million for drug 
treatment research says the strategy update released in january 
which notes we need a great deal more information about 
treatment methods for cocaine and crack addiction 
estes whose irvine califbased organization represents some 
700 private drug treatment providers said clinics recently have 
added separate cocaine tracks to their programs 
what stimulated that was you could tell cocaine patients 
werent doing that well when they were lumped together with 
general alcohol abusers even though cocaine addicts often also use 
other drugs such as alcohol and marijuana estes said 
theyre a different breed of cat real jumpy real hyper 
he said 
james n hall executive director of the up front drug 
information center in miami said some cocaine abuse treatment does 
work especially longterm treatment that allows brain chemicals 
the many months needed to return to normal levels and he 
contended that relapses arent failures 
its considered by some therapists almost a natural course in 
recovery he said if an individual relapses it doesnt mean 
the individual has failed you have to consider the time before 
relapse and how short the relapse is we tend to take a criminal 
justice model in looking at this medical problem viewing a 
relapse in the same terms as a recidivist criminal who must be sent 
back to jail 
in addition he said people from lower socioeconomic 
communities hard hit by crack epidemics have little chance to fight 
their addiction when they return home with no prospects for 
alternatives to drugs 
for many crack addicts the issue is habilitation not 
rehabilitation he said

unless birth control becomes available to 
everybody by the end of the decade the number of people on this 
already overcrowded planet will double before a baby born today 
reaches middle age according to a study released sunday 
this is a preventable disaster said sharon l camp vice 
president of the private population crisis committee a 
washingtonbased advocacy group that released the report 
we have what it would take the financial resources and the 
know how to solve the problem and to do so in our childrens 
lifetime 
but we have to act immediately we cannot dither away another 
decade she said 
there are about 53 billion people in the world a figure that 
the united nations says could rise to 14 billion before stabilizing 
in the next century the committee said todays population could 
double in 39 years and reach 27 billion by the end of the 21st 
century if present birth and death rates continued unchanged 
stopping population growth at about 9 billion to 10 billion 
people would require use of contraceptives by some 75 percent of 
couples the study estimates but to accomplish that the products 
would have to be available to everyone by the end of this century 
so the average family size could fall to about two children per 
couple early in the 21st century 
the report goes on to estimate the cost of such an effort 
105 billion per year by the year 2000 currently 32 billion is 
spent on family planning in developing countries where most 
population growth is taking place 
to finance this effort the report calls for increased aid from 
industrial nations including 12 billion from the united states 
4 billion from other developed nations 1 billion from 
development banks 500 million from private philanthropists and 1 
billion from consumers of family planning services 
universal family planning is a bargain compared to the costs 
of delaying world population stabilization camp said 
the analysis found 29 countries including the united states 
japan and most of europe well on the way to ending population 
growth 
in addition a dozen countries were making good progress 
the report said these included argentina poland israel turkey 
and thailand 
but 18 nations were rated poor and 45 as very poor in 
encouraging birth control

the term hanging judge may have to be 
rethought more people convicted of felonies by state court juries 
wind up in prison than those found guilty by judges and they spend 
a longer time incarcerated says a study released sunday 
at the same time the overwhelming majority of convicted felons 
89 percent plead guilty and those who own up to their misdeeds 
spend a shorter time in prison than those convicted by a judge or a 
jury the justice department reported 
the penalties of life in prison or death are meted out to 47 
percent of those convicted by juries of murder or nonnegligent 
manslaughter meanwhile only 15 percent of those who pleaded 
guilty to such charges and 12 percent of those found guilty by a 
judge received those penalties said the report by the departments 
bureau of justice statistics 
it is unclear why defendants convicted by juries were more 
severely punished the study said but it noted that a higher 
percentage of the convictions by juries were for violent offenses 
within each type of offense ranging from murder to drug 
trafficking to larceny a higher percentage of particularly 
serious cases may have been decided by juries the study said 
defendants in such serious cases violent and nonviolent may 
have been less willing to plead guilty because they expected very 
severe penalties it added in addition prosecutors may have 
recommended and judges may have imposed shorter sentences for those 
who pled compared to those found guilty by trial 
the study based on information from 100 counties in 37 states 
regarding all convicted felons sentenced in 1986 cautioned that 
the findings should be considered preliminary because of the 
limited sample size the next survey is to cover 300 jurisdictions 
of the estimated 583000 people convicted of a felony in state 
courts in 1986 89 percent pleaded guilty 8 percent were convicted 
by a jury and 3 percent were found guilty by a judge the report 
says 
but many of the guilty pleas were for lesser offenses with 92 
percent of the larceny convictions and 90 percent of the burglary 
convictions based on guilty pleas but only 58 percent of the 
murder convictions and 68 percent of the rape convictions based on 
such pleas 
felons convicted by a jury were sentenced to an average of 159 
months in prison compared with 103 months when felons were 
convicted by a judge and 72 months for those who pleaded guilty 
also 84 percent of felons convicted by a jury were sentenced to 
prison or jail rather than probation or other types of sentences 
while 71 percent of those convicted by a judge were incarcerated 
and only 65 percent of those who pleaded guilty were incarcerated 
prison sentences not including jail terms were handed down to 71 
percent of those convicted by a jury 50 percent of those found 
guilty by a judge and 44 percent of those who pleaded guilty

riot police armed with rifles arrested at 
least 150 people sunday to prevent marches by prodemocracy 
demonstrators demanding the government lift its 29yearold ban on 
political parties 
the protesters shouting long live the revolution were 
taken into custody as they entered katmandus main shopping 
district of new road to begin marching said witnesses who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the planned march was one of several scheduled around nepal by 
two banned political groups the nepali congress party and a 
leftwing coalition who are leading a movement for more political 
freedom 
political demonstrations are not allowed in nepal 
according to the government at least 12 people have been killed 
since feb 18 when the movement was launched to demand restoration 
of a multiparty democracy 
activists say the death toll is nearly double the government 
figure 
activists said at least 1000 people were taken into custody 
sunday mostly in the capital but the witnesses who have proved 
reliable in the past said they only saw about 150 people being 
herded into a police station 
the police refused to give any figures 
residents contacted by telephone said police also arrested 
demonstrators in the southeastern town of dharan on sunday but 
they had no details 
the outcome of the other planned marches was not immediately 
known 
the staterun news agency said without elaborating that some 
persons who tried to raise undesirable slogans were arrested in 
the southern town of nepalganj the report was the only reference 
by the government to any demonstration in the himalayan kingdom 
one of the worlds oldest monarchies 
witnesses said those arrested in katmandu included hari bol 
bhattarai former mayor of the city and a senior member of the 
nepali congress and padma ratna tuladhar a leftwing member of 
the national assembly 
both were waving the black flags adopted by the new 
prodemocracy movement and were shouting antigovernment slogans 
when policemen tore the flags from their hands and took them away 
said witnesses 
earlier sunday more than 100 doctors and nurses in the 
countrys largest hospital walked off their jobs for more than one 
hour in support of the prodemocracy movement they gathered 
outside the 300bed bir hospital in the capital wearing black 
armbands over their white jackets 
we mourn the death of our people said one doctor who 
refused to give his name for fear of reprisals this is a protest 
against the governments violation of human rights 
medical students said in a statement they supported the movement 
in katmandu hundreds of steelhelmeted policemen wearing chest 
pads and carrying rifles batons bamboo shields and teargas 
canisters patrolled the 2squaremile new road area watched by 
reporters and throngs of tourists 
shops were closed and only police vans and a few private 
vehicles were allowed in the usually bustling area 
the government has accused the demonstrators of trying to impose 
their brand of democracy on a country which it says already has a 
working democracy 
power in nepal is shared between the king and the national 
assembly onefifth of the assemblys 140 members are nominated by 
the king the rest are elected on a nonparty basis advocates of 
multiparty democracy say the elections are a farce and that the 
only candidates allowed are those approved by king birendra or his 
associates 
nepals twoyear experiment with westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when thenking mahendra the present monarchs father 
dissolved the government of the nepali congress party accusing it 
of corruption and poor administration

the justice department is weighing whether to 
farm out to private business the work of government historians who 
furnish research ammunition for the agencys special nazihunting 
unit 
the proposal is being studied as part of the bush 
administrations effort to save money by privatizing certain 
functions performed by government workers but it has caused alarm 
in some circles that the work of the unit the office of special 
investigations will be undermined 
an official of the simon wiesenthal center the leading research 
center on the mass extermination of jews before and during world 
war ii criticized the idea saying it comes at a time when changes 
in eastern europe will give unprecedented access to nazi records 
it is absolutely beyond belief that a diminution of the work 
of osi would be considered at this point said rabbi abraham 
cooper associate dean of los angelesbased center 
he said changes in east germany make it likely that the justice 
department will be able for the first time to study the files of 
the gestapo in east berlin and that this opportunity must be 
seized 
contracting work to the outside im afraid might be the 
signal that the government is looking to begin the process of 
paring back the work of the osi cooper said 
justice department spokesman doug tillett denied that saying 
we obviously want to make sure there is no diminution in the 
level of services provided by the osi employees 
tillett said the department is only studying the feasibility of 
hiring a private contractor to do the work the study was 
undertaken to comply with a white house office of management and 
budget directive that all agencies identify jobs that could be 
contracted out to private companies he said 
government historians are listed by omb as positions that could 
be turned over to private contractors he said 
tillett said contractors must show they can do the work for a 
price that is 10 percent lower than what it now costs the 
government 
the plan envisions using a private company to do the work of six 
government historians these government employees over the years 
have read german russian and other east european languages 
authenticated and interpreted world war iiera documents that 
prosecutors used to prove involvement in nazi persecution of jews 
and other war crimes 
they are described by former justice department officials as key 
participants in the investigations conducted by the osi since it 
was founded in 1979 that unit has investigated more than 1300 
cases of suspected nazis living in this country 
during the last 11 years 27 former nazis have been deported or 
extradited to other countries after the justice department 
unearthed proof they were involved in nazi war crimes 
the typical nazi war criminal identified by justice department 
investigators was a former guard at a concentration camp or the 
member of an ss militia that persecuted jews or other ethnic groups 
in nazioccupied countries they came to this country by concealing 
their nazi past to us immigration authorities 
martin mendelsohn a washington attorney who helped set up the 
unit when he worked at the justice department also criticized the 
plan 
given the fact that office has been understaffed for years 
they shouldnt be further reducing the number of people that they 
have said mendelsohn 
the department would be losing many experienced people he said 
most of them have been there for some time 
jeffrey n mausner a former justice department lawyer who 
worked in the unit said the six employees serve both as 
historians and investigators 
they locate documents determine the historical significance 
of the documents mausner said they also help locate witnesses 
to bolster the justice departments evidence he said 
besides german and russian the historians are expert in baltic 
and balkan languages he said

when joseph hazelwood became the target 
of criminal charges in the exxon valdez oil spill the tanker 
captain turned to a former maritime college classmate who had 
become a lawyer 
the lawyer brought in a friend from his law school days and 
they then turned to a former law partner of alaskas governor for 
help 
theyll all be on center stage this week to open their defense 
of hazelwood portrayed in three weeks of prosecution testimony and 
questioning as a drunk who let his ship get away from him 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with a felony and 
three misdemeanors in the march 24 grounding that caused the 
nations worst oil spill he could receive up to 7 years in prison 
and 61000 in fines 
his ship struck a reef outside normal shipping lanes and gushed 
nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude oil into scenic prince 
william sound coating hundreds of miles of shore with black goo 
hazelwood is the only person criminally charged in the disaster 
at the counsel table with hazelwood in superior court is michael 
chalos 42 an exuberant advocate whose knowledge of nautical 
terminology and navigational logic has proved invaluable 
chalos was born in chios greece when he was 8 his family 
moved to long beach ny he attended the state universitys 
maritime college at fort schuyler where he met hazelwood 
he was in the class of 68 and i was in the class of 70 
said chalos we both played lacrosse they became friends and 
stayed in touch 
chalos worked as a seaman for three years before entering 
fordham university law school from which he graduated in 1975 his 
new york firm chalos english amp brown now has 20 lawyers he has 
used hazelwood as an expert witness in maritime cases 
a member of the firm and of the hazelwood defense team is thomas 
russo 43 a former chief assistant district attorney in new york 
russo and chalos met at fordham and kept in touch 
mike and i had talked for many years about working together 
russo recalled he thought i might like the change of working in 
a nice quiet maritime practice they joined forces two years 
ago then he calls and tells me were representing captain 
hazelwood 
they needed an alaska lawyer to augment the team and after much 
research chose dick madson of fairbanks 
madson 54 a native of keewatin minn and a 21year resident 
of fairbanks brings to the defense knowledge of alaska law and an 
insiders view of the states political backbone his longtime 
partner was steve cowper alaskas governor 
madson moved to alaska with his wife and three children after 
graduating from william mitchell college of law in st paul minn 
he has an undergraduate degree in mining engineering 
he was one of alaskas first public defenders and since has 
handled a wide array of criminal cases 
we recognize this is a case in alaska and you cant get more 
alaskan than dick said russo he has the alaska perspective 
madsons folksy witticisms often amuse the jury while bringing 
stern reprimands from judge karl johnstone 
russo said he sees the hazelwood trial as a diversionary tactic 
by state and federal agencies to play down their own potential 
culpability he calls hazelwood a scapegoat 
its about money chalos said theres a lot of money 
involved youve got plaintiffs with lawsuits involving billions of 
dollars 
madson said the heart of it is a political trial 
chalos would not discuss the financial arrangement the lawyers 
have with hazelwood 
hazelwood has been reviled by alaskans because of the spill but 
his lawyers see a shift in attitude 
i was walking down the street with him this week madson 
said and a woman stopped her car and yelled out is that captain 
hazelwood i said no thats not him then she shouted i love 
him i shouted back thats him

steps toward economic and monetary union that are proposed for the 
period immediately following the elections in the gdr on march 18th 
if events are moving faster than we expected it just means 
that our common goal for all these years of german unity will be 
realized even sooner than had been hoped we share a common belief 
that a unified germany should remain a full member of the north 
atlantic treaty organization including participation in its 
military structure now we agreed that us military forces should 
remain stationed in a united germany and elsewhere in europe as a 
continuing guarantor of stability 
the chancellor and i are also in agreement that in a united 
in a unified state the former territory of the gdr should have a 
special miliary status that would take into account the legitimate 
security interests of all interested countries including those of 
the soviet union at the same time the chancellor and i agree that 
we must continue to press hard for arms control efforts which would 
sharply reduce military forces in europe from the atlantic to the 
urals we want to work together to have a cfe agreement ready for 
signature this year at a summit meeting of all 35 csce member 
states the summit could also endorse our proposal for csce 
guidelines on free elections to help show the way and protect the 
emerging democratic institutions of eastern europe 
chancellor kohl and i had a good discussion on eastwest 
relations we both support chairman gorbachevs program of 
perestroika his efforts to reform his countrys political and 
enomic system chairman gorbachev has shown true statemanship in 
respecting the will of the people in eastern europe in trying to 
build new relationships based on cooperation instead of coercion 
since those difficult days following world war ii when america 
joined hands with the german people in their effort to build a new 
state and a new society the united states has been their partner 
in a common dream and that dream was to build a free democratic 
and prosperous german republic committed to peace and working in 
close harmony with its closest neighbors that enduring 
germanamerican partnership has never been stronger as chancellor 
kohl the leader of one of the worlds great democracies steps 
toward a golden moment in the history of his nation mr 
chancellor it was a pleasure to have you with us and now for your 
statement sir

president felix houphouetboigny 
once praised as a peacemaker and the driving force of an 
agricultural power increasingly has been targeted in complaints 
about police repression and a souring economy 
police in the past week have beaten and arrested hundreds of 
demonstrators who demanded the ouster of africas longestserving 
president and an end to his oneparty conservative rule 
the official media which have built a personality cult around 
houphouetboigny have made no mention of the protests 
houphouetboigny chaired a cabinet meeting during last weeks 
unrest but state media reported only that officials discussed the 
west african nations economic crisis 
austerity measures that helped provoke the unrest were required 
by western donors who already have rescheduled the countrys 12 
billion debt 
our cup of anger overflowed when the last drop of water 
dribbled from the tap a law student said describing the scene 
one night last week in the communal bathroom of a student residence 
darkened by power cuts 
the staterun power company said the cuts feb 19 were caused by 
an explosion at a transformer no mention was made of the water 
shortage 
students and radio treichville the name given to the 
wellinformed rumor network said workers forced to take 30 percent 
pay cuts caused the service disruptions as a protest 
the methods used against protesters are not in the usual style 
of the 84yearold president who has led this nation of 11 million 
people since its independence from france in 1960 
he has perfected the art of coopting the opposition said 
laurent gbabgo an opposition leader 
in the past people did not feel badly governed because if 
there was a problem the government just bought it out they had 
lots of money and just doled it out he said 
houphouetboignys government has not been above tough tactics 
when it felt threatened by criticism from the university 
lecturers union in 1987 it simply hijacked the body office 
holders were arrested for alleged embezzlement of funds and drafted 
into two years military service a handpicked committee replaced 
them 
but the economic problems have unearthed such dissent that 
houphouetboigny called a national dialogue in september and told 
delegates no holds were barred 
it brought at least one demand he could not stomach again from 
the university lecturers union union president marcel ette urged 
creation of a multiparty democracy 
the president responded that there would be no multiparty 
democracy in ivory coast at least not in his lifetime as other 
african dictators have done he argued that a multiparty system 
would endanger national unity in a country still beset by tribal 
rivalries 
the ivory coast constitution allows political opposition but 
things start happening if you try to insist on your rights 
gbagbo said in an interview you and your friends get arrested 
your bank account gets frozen suddenly business isnt good 
houphouetboigny vigorously encouraged agricultural production 
of the cash crops pushed by western institutions in the 1960s and 
1970s 
while most of black africa became net food importers following 
independence from european colonial powers his efforts spurred 
ivorian farmers to record production 
last year amid a continuing slump in commodity prices ivory 
coast produced a record 820000 tons of cocoa nine times what it 
produced in 1960 and nearly a third of world production it is the 
worlds biggest cocoa producer 
but cocoa prices were slashed to half those of 1985 in october 
houphouetboigny was forced to abandon his promise to support 
prices for farmers and he cut promised producer prices for cocoa 
and coffee in half 
critics like gbagbo say the president is too old and set in his 
ways to look to industrialization and other routes to revive the 
economy 
but houphouetboigny looks more like a man in his 70s and 
appears alert astute and far from ready to retire 
the old regime is dying but its dying badly gbagbo 
complained 
its dying throes will come because ivorians are being hit where 
it hurts most in their pockets he said 
when wealthy ivorians go to the bank to cash a 17500 check 
the liquidity crisis forces the banks to tell them to make the 
check out for 88 he said 
a government clerk feeling the pinch of a pay cut expressed it 
another way last year i gave my son a few francs for lunch and 
he could have a hot stew and grilled bananas the same money today 
buys only the bananas and i dont have the extra money to buy him 
the stew

x x x statement sir 
chancellor kohl through interpreter translator starts in 
progress the reception here in camp david the atmosphere the 
climate of our meeting is symbolic of the excellent germanamerican 
relations in particular now when the day of unity is drawing near 
for us germans we are conscious with profound gratitude of the 
fact that all of this would not have been possible without the 
close friendship and the confident partnership with the united 
states of america 
in the spirit of this friendship the two of us mr 
president in the course of these hours in camp david we have 
discussed a vast list of political issues in the center of our 
conversations was the future of the transatlantic relations and 
embedded therein the path of the germans towards national unity 
against the background of historic changes on the european 
continent we have reconfirmed our common beliefs first the 
alliance of the free democracies in europe and north america and 
included therein the germanamerican partnership are of 
fundamental importance for peace and security this is true now 
this will be true in future second the security link between 
north america and europe is and continues to be and in the future 
for us germans that is to say also for a united germany of 
vital importance that is why we need the presence of our american 
friends in europe in germany and that includes the presence of 
american forces also for a united germany in the future 
maintaining the friendship with the united states of america and 
the expansion of relations with them will be an important task 
we are happy about the ever closer economic cooperation and 
economic exchange exchange in the fields of science and culture 
and about the ever more meaningful meetings between people in 
particular of the young generation we are convinced that 
transatlantic relations must systematically be expanded in all 
fields it is the common security in the alliance which is part of 
this of the ever closer contacts between the european community 
including political cooperation and the united states and this 
includes also our joint efforts to make our way towards a european 
peace order within the framework of the csce seeing the major 
changes in central europe east europe southeast europe the 
european community continues to be an indispensable anchor of 
european civility 
that is why we the federal republic of germany in particular 
myself do not only want to expand european integration but we want 
to accelerate this process wherever possible beyond the big 
internal market which is to be achieved on the 31st of december 
1992 beyond the economic and monetary union our primordial aim 
continues to be political union in europe that was the objective 
of the treaties of rome and nothing has changed in that area it is 
our joint interest that the reform policy in central east and 
southeast europe and in particular the policy led by secretary 
general gorbachev and the soviet union will be successful europe 
and north america are and continue to be open for cooperation as 
partners in particular with the reform states and i welcome 
particularly what you have just said about the subject mr 
president 
and because of our conversations were also agreed that 
disarmament negotiations must energetically be pursued and be led 
to a success on the path towards german unity ladies and 
gentlemen what we need in particular now is reason and good 
judgment we germans walk along this path with a particular 
responsibility in the center of europe and were doing so if you 
like along two tracks which are of equal importance on the one 
hand we are leading intensive talks with gdr and at present we 
will in particular have to concentrate on the customs union and 
the economic community on the other hand we do have to consider 
that the link with our transatlantic partners that european unity 
and comprehensive cooperation between east and west are being 
linked up with the development we do respect the legitimate 
security interests of all states and we respect peoples feelings 
especially the feelings of our neighbors 
and i am saying this particularly addressing our polish 
neighbors the border question will be settled definitely by a 
freely elected allgerman government and a freely elected 
allgerman parliament but let me repeat here what i have recently 
said in paris already it was in january of this year nobody 
has any intention of linking the question of national unity with 
changes of existing borders

louis sullivan after a shaky start as the 
nations top health official has seized the antismoking campaign 
as his own winning kudos from congress and grabbing headlines with 
talk of blood money and trading death for corporate profits 
following the wellworn path of previous federal health 
officials sullivan the secretary of health and human services 
has cranked up the war of words against tobacco companies to new 
heights 
he certainly has found an area where he has been willing to be 
outspoken and has taken the leadership said rep henry waxman 
dcalif chairman of the house energy and commerce health 
subcommittee 
but some say smoking is a safe issue since sullivan isnt 
attacking tobacco subsidies or proposing a ban on advertising and 
they say sullivan who for nearly a year has run the federal 
department with the largest budget has yet to show such bold 
leadership on the larger issues confronting the administration 
including the nations soaring healthcare bill 
sullivan first stepped out on the smoking issue jan 18 when he 
criticized rj reynolds tobacco cos plan to target blacks with a 
new cigarette brand called uptown the next day the company 
canceled plans for the new product but sullivan promised to 
continue his attack on the tobacco industry 
last week sullivan called on athletes and athletic associations 
to reject tobacco company sponsorships and he didnt mince words 
this blood money should not be used to foster a misleading 
impression that smoking is compatible with good health 
appearing before the senate labor and human resources committee 
a few days earlier he said it is morally wrong to promote a 
product which when used as intended causes death trading death 
for corporate profits 
in the wake of reports that reynolds had considered marketing a 
new cigarette brand called dakota to young women with no more than 
a high school education sullivan said such advertising was 
dishonest irresponsible and unconscionable 
before he seized the antismoking issue sullivan had been on 
the defensive for most of his first year on the job first he 
angered righttolife groups with comments implying that he 
supported abortion rights he quickly retreated and said he 
supported president bushs antiabortion stand 
later he raised another storm when he endorsed local community 
efforts to experiment with needleexchange programs to help stem 
the spread of aids he later backed off that statement as well 
his bold antismoking campaign however is helping to turn 
around his image as a fumbling newcomer to washington politics 
it increases his profile in the administration and in 
congress and that can do nothing but help said edmund 
haislmaier health care policy analyst at the heritage foundation 
a conservative think tank 
the real test though is how effective hes going to be 
in advocating reform in the programs in his department 
haislmaier said the effects of an antismoking effort are very 
small it will have a positive impact but how much and when is a 
very debatable question and does not really deal with the major 
health care financing issues hhs is involved in 
on the tobacco issue sullivan is following a trail blazed by 
previous public health officials dating back to the first surgeon 
general luther terry who put out the initial surgeon generals 
report on smoking in 1964 
former surgeon general c everett koop before he left office 
last summer was the nations leading antismoking crusader for 
most of the 1980s with no statutory authority or budget koop used 
his post as bully pulpit to preach the dangers of smoking 
endorsing a ban on cigarette advertising and declaring nicotine to 
be as addictive as heroin 
before him joseph califano secretary of what then was called 
the department of health education and welfare campaigned 
aggressively against smoking and drew a lot of fire in the process 
he angered many members of congress from southern tobaccogrowing 
states 
sullivan said he has gotten not one iota of pressure from 
the administration to back off from his campaign 
ive gotten support and commendations from not only members of 
congress but also members of the administration he said 
but sullivan has refrained from being anything more than an 
antismoking advocate asked whether the government should cut off 
subsidies to tobacco growers or whether cigarette taxes should be 
raised he says those are not decisions for him to make 
my role is to put the facts out to advocate he said 
waxman said that while he applauds sullivans antismoking 
leadership i hope now to see him follow up his statements with 
support for legislation 
the california democrat plans to introduce a bill focusing on 
regulation of tobacco promotions and advertising along with 
stronger warning labels on cigarette packages 
sen edward kennedy dmass introduced an antismoking measure 
that focuses chiefly on education efforts and regulation of tobacco 
product ingredients 
sullivan said that while he supported the intent of most of the 
legislation he believes it duplicates efforts already under way 
though sullivan has always opposed smoking his campaign against 
tobacco companies is relatively new for him 
in september 1987 while serving on an advisory board of the 
national cancer institute sullivan presented to the board a report 
on a national black leadership initiative on cancer that advised 
education as the key weapon rather than a frontal attack on the 
tobacco companies 
asked about this change of strategy sullivan pointed to a new 
government report estimating that smoking costs the nation about 
52 billion annually largely in increased healthcare and 
insurance costs

x x x existing borders 
in the course of our talks i have informed president bush about 
the situation in gdr and the talks i have had a couple of days ago 
only with secretary general gorbachev and i wish to seize this 
opportunity mr president to thank you publicly today and here 
before the press that on the eve of my trip to moscow you sent me 
a letter which did not only speak about supporting our policy and 
was not only backed by the habitual friendship but which will be 
going down in history as an important document of germanamerican 
friendship let me conclude by thanking you very much again for 
your friendship and for the lovely hours we have been able to spend 
with you here i think this will mark our future cooperation as 
well 
president bush helmut if its agreeable to you might i 
suggest to the press that we alternate the questions between us is 
that agreeable with you sir 
q question in german partially translated do you consider 
the question of borders 
chancellor kohl my answer is very clear and i assure you 
translation off mike correctly according to the legal 
situation in our country it is a freely elected parliament the 
sovereign of the people which has to decide this question and 
this is laid down also in the treaties of 1970 and has been 
mentioned in the conversations which took place in those years 
again and again past months that and i do want to repeat 
nobody wants to link the question of national unity with changes in 
existing borders and nobody is permitted to doubt my attitude 
there 
q do you consider it excluded that before german unity a treaty 
be concluded with the poles about the polish border do you 
consider this excluded 
chancellor kohl if i interpret the wish of the polish 
government correctly and i think i do then the polish government 
does have a very national wish that the competent sovereign the 
legally competent sovereign take that decision in poland there 
are certain circles who wish that before such a decision to be 
adopted by an allgerman parliament decisions be taken in the two 
german states in the federal german west german parliament 
we have already pronounced ourselves and confirmed our line about 
the nonchanging of borders 
president bush might i just add the us permission sic us 
position with your permission mr chancellor the us respects the 
provisions of the helsinki final act regarding the inviolability of 
current borders in europe and the us formally recognizes the 
current germanpolish border i just wanted to get that in yes 
craig 
q do you think there is some difference between what you have 
just said and what the chancellor said there seems to be some lack 
a bit of equivocation on his part do you think there is any 
difference in the us view and what the chancellor is saying today 
president bush i think were in alignment i did not i would 
not interpret what he said as equivocating at all and i have just 
given you the us position 
q mr president can you explain for us 
president bush okay lets take this then well be two each 
and then i think out courtesy we should alter them yeah charlie 
q can you explain for us at this stage precisely how the 
twoplusfour works what the sequencing is whether they are 
consecutive and inaudible theres been so much confusion 
about that whos got what rights 
president bush no that those details have not been fully 
worked out in terms of timings of meetings and things of this 
nature they have not been worked out this formula was approved by 
the foreign ministers in ottawa and we simply have not tried to 
sit here in camp david and fine tune the procedures for the 
twoplusfour you got a followup im not sure i was responsive 
charlie 
q well im not sure that i know any more than when you started 
and that may be part of the problem here that it is not clear 
whether the germans hold their meetings simultaneous with you 
whether youre in adjacent rooms whether you run back and forth

free speech advocates say access to the public 
soapbox is at stake monday in a case before the us supreme court 
involving two lyndon larouche followers who tried to solicit 
support on a post office sidewalk 
the courts decision will either broaden access to government 
property for the purpose of free speech or further restrict what 
constitutes a public forum 
the case will also allow the court to clarify conflicting 
rulings from federal appeals courts on the governments ban on 
soliciting on postal service property 
groups such as the hare krishnas conservative christians the 
aflcio and newspapers have filed friendofthecourt briefs urging 
that free speech rights be expanded 
the public forum doctrine is for the little person said 
attorney jay sekulow missionaries and evangelicals cannot afford 
fullpage newspaper ads they can afford a sidewalk to talk to 
people about the gospel 
sekulow represents marsha kokinda and kevin pearl larouche 
volunteers who were convicted of violating a regulation against 
soliciting electioneering collecting debts vending and 
advertising on postal service property 
larouche a political extremist and sometime presidential 
candidate is serving a 15year prison term for his 1988 conviction 
on fraud and conspiracy charges prosecutors accused him of 
conspiring to accept millions of dollars in loans from political 
supporters he had no intention of repaying 
courts have wrestled with a number of cases in recent years 
seeking to define a public forum where speech cannot be 
unreasonably restricted judges have been asked to decide for 
example whether taxpayerfinanced airline terminals or private 
shopping malls can bar people from handing out leaflets or asking 
for contributions 
kokinda and pearl chose as their soapbox a narrow strip of 
sidewalk leading between the parking lot and the doors of the tiny 
post office on a busy highway in this washington suburb they were 
arrested in 1986 after they refused to stop soliciting 
contributions and distributing literature from a table 
kokinda was fined 50 and sentenced to 10 days in jail pearl 
was fined 100 their convictions were thrown out by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals in 1989 
the supreme court will hear arguments monday and is expected to 
issue a decision by july 
in appealing to the high court the government argues that there 
is a difference between a city sidewalk and one located entirely on 
postal service property it also argues that picketing handing out 
pamphlets and soliciting interfere with postal business and a 
justice department attorney will argue monday that free speech is 
limited to some extent on all government property 
the 4th circuit ruling is binding in maryland north carolina 
south carolina virginia and west virginia 
but two other appeals courts have upheld the ban on soliciting 
on post office property so there is no nationwide standard for the 
postal service to follow 
david liberman an attorney for the international society of 
krishna consciousness said the postal service is isolating its 
property from other government buildings that are considered public 
where do you find the people these days a suburban post 
office is where you find the people if this is not a forum then 
the government can exclude everything from that place he said

x x x and forth 
president bush no no those details have not been worked 
out and it would be wrong for the united states to try to sit on 
its own and work out with the german chancellor all these technical 
matters that involve others so we did not get into those details 
here today 
chancellor kohl i would like to make a brief remark about the 
subject all the more so since i dont believe that there is any 
reason for considering the situation with inaudible first 
im very happy with the decision adopted in ottawa 
twoplusfour it is only natural that the two states in germany 
in particular after the 18th of march elections in gdr will be 
discussing the subject in a particular way this is a subject which 
concerns the germans in particular but i spoke about the two 
tracks a moment ago along which things have to proceed we will 
then at the level of twoplus four have to discuss things very 
frankly and were not trying to exclude anybody that was sort 
of the background of what you were saying but we will have to 
discuss things in every necessary detail and i think that is 
possible within a reasonable time frame 
q in german 
chancellor kohl if we talk to one another this is a we have 
a good chance of understanding one another 
q mr president inaudible how do the poles come into 
this so that are they just one of the 35 at the end of it 
president bush well there was i know of polands feeling to 
want to make twoplusfour into twoplusfive is that what youre 
asking about the twoplusfour has been agreed upon clearly no 
agreement would ever be reached that affects the polish borders 
without polish involvements but there is no change we dont sit 
up here and try to change an agreement that was taken by several 
countries at ottawa but there will be a lot of consultative 
mechanisms 
chancellor kohl ja 
president bush to deal with the interests not just of 
poland but of our allies and everyone else and the chancellor is 
very good about that and i hope weve been good about it and it 
is essential that we stay on the same wavelength with our allies 
and friends excuse me helmut i interrupted you sir 
chancellor kohl let me underpin what the president just said i 
do realize that there is a particular interest on the part of the 
poles and im certain that in the course of this process we will 
find ways and means of adopting solutions satisfactory to 
everybody i think everyone of us has a feeling that there is a 
particular situation there but i dont consider it useful that the 
two of us while nobody else from among our partners is here try 
and decide about things and make declarations today 
q off mike europe from poland to britain and our own 
former director of intelligence mr helms has called the german 
unification march a runaway freight train given the history that 
the role that germany played in the two wars in this century 
shouldnt there be some assurances before this marriage takes place 
on borders and security 
president bush i think all those matters will be discussed in 
the various consultative mechanisms that we brought up but i 
prefer to look at germanys 45 years of contribution to democracy 
and to the security of the west and thats what we are focusing 
on i have stated the us position which is not to be afraid of 
german reunification but to understand when peoples brother on 
one side brother on another want to get together as one 
country as they were before this artificial division that was 
that was resulted as out of world war ii so weve already 
crossed that bridge we welcome reunification but its not for the 
united states to set a timetable its not for us to say how fast 
it is for us to guarantee as best we can in consultation with our 
allies that whatever evolves will be stable and that peace will be 
the result so i ive already given you the view in my 
statement about the us toward unification and we are not in a 
process of trying to speed it up or slow it down its a matter for 
the german people matter for the discussions that that will be 
taking place in multilateral fora

guerrilla commanders admitted 
sunday they have suffered major battlefield losses to government 
troops and blamed a halt in weapons shipments from china their 
main supplier 
it remains unclear if the cutoff confirmed by western 
diplomats in bangkok is because of logistical problems or a policy 
decision by the chinese government 
on friday government troops rolled into the strategic 
guerrillaheld town of svay chek guerrilla leaders said sunday 
they were unable to make a stand at a second important town tmar 
puok because of a shortage of ammunition 
we cannot defend tmar puok it looks very bad right now 
said a senior commander of the khmer peoples national liberation 
front the front is allied with the communist khmer rouge and a 
group loyal to guerrilla coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk 
the commander said the front abandoned its civilian 
administration headquarters in tmar puok which had served 50000 
civilians as a liberated zone since guerrillas seized it in 
september 
the guerrilla coalition stepped up its offensive against the 
government in the fall after vietnam claimed to have withdrawn its 
last troops and ended an 11year military intervention 
repeated attempts to establish a formula for peace have failed 
a plan that would have the united nations run cambodia until 
elections is expected to be discussed in three days of informal 
talks that begin monday in jakarta indonesia 
a western analyst on the thai border estimated 15000 civilians 
would flee to the thai frontier if tmar puok fell thousands have 
already left areas of fighting and were moving closer to the 
border analysts said 
the guerrillas seized a large swath of territory along the thai 
border following the vietnamese withdrawal the reversal came as 
sihanouk ended 11 years of exile on friday saying he would live in 
villages northeast of the current fighting 
officials and refugees at site b located along the 
thaicambodian border said sihanouks return was a boost to morale 
among the more than 50000 camp residents 
well win now 51yearold refugee kim lay said sunday at 
site b the principal refugee camp for sihanouks followers 
but a recent defector from khmer rouge forces at the camp said 
the groups fighting ability was hurt by a sharp drop in weapons 
and other supplies from china about two months ago 
before china used to support us 100 percent now its only 50 
percent there is even a lack of food its not like it was 
before said hem khaem a 25yearold former khmer rouge company 
commander we were told in meetings that we had to save 
everything the principle was one bullet should kill one person 
and if you couldnt get a good shot dont shoot 
the front received its last shipment of chinese weapons in early 
december according to diplomatic and guerrilla sources some 
guerrilla commanders have said the cutoff was to force the 
coalition to work more closely together 
the front and sihanouks forces are deeply suspicious of the

people have been moving into mountain lion country 
in coal creek canyon west of boulder for 30 years but now there 
are enough people there that the big cats are becoming accustomed 
to them and getting bolder 
pets have been killed there before but so far this winter 
mountain lions have killed three dogs on their owners property 
one was leashed and one was in an enclosure one of the dogs was a 
labrador retriever and one a german shepherd 
the owner of a doberman pinscher heard a commotion behind his 
house and found a mountain lion attacking the dog when confronted 
by the human the cat calmly walked away the dog was hospitalized 
twenty miles from the canyon a mountain lion last week 
apparently killed three llamas at a ranch a private hunter killed 
a mountain lion in the canyon 
residents fear the next victims may be children walking to 
school bus stops before sunup prime hunting time for the big 
cats also known as cougars or pumas 
were not trying to get people paranoid but they are living 
in lion habitat they can be taught to be lion smart just as city 
kids have to be taught to be street smart if kids are too young to 
be lion smart they shouldnt be outside alone said kathi 
demarest a state wildlife biologist 
we are not going to kill lions just because people are afraid 
of them we are not going back to the 1870s when lions were killed 
for a bounty 
several hundred people live in the canyon on scattered home 
sites wildlife officials have begun a series of meetings with them 
to educate them about living in lion country 
people tell us they live in the colorado mountains because of 
the wildlife my goal is to teach people to appreciate the wildlife 
and live with it demarest said 
she estimated five to 45 pmas remain in the canyon area 
the cats are tawny colored with a black tip on the tail an 
adult can grow to more than 7 feet from nose to tip of tail and 
weigh upwards of 150 pounds its method of attack is to lie in 
ambush then leap on the back of its prey and bite through the 
skull or neck for the kill their main prey is deer 
kristi coughlon a state wildlife manager in the boulder 
district said there have been three confirmed mountain lion kills 
of dogs another dog injured and several unconfirmed pet kills and 
missing pets this winter however coyotes also take dogs and cats 
and landowners kill dogs she said 
if any of the mountain lions become aggressive toward humans 
state trackers can be brought in to kill them she said some 
people have obtained special state permits to kill cougars that 
have killed dogs 
until recent years there had never been a confirmed unprovoked 
mountain lion attack on a human in this country 
that changed with mass human encroachment upon lion habitat a 
child was killed by a lion in montana and a child was injured and 
another killed in an orange county calif wildlife refuge 
authorities said there have also been mountain lion attacks in 
arizona and texas 
parents must start taking their kids to the bus stop install 
a light at the bus stop clear brush away from the area dont let 
kids play alone near brush and install fenced play areas for 
kids demarest said 
many city people unwittingly do things that put them on a 
clear collision course with wildlife such as putting out salt 
blocks for deer she said 
theyre just setting themselves up for lion trouble she 
said 
mountain residents should bring their pets in at night along 
with pet food and not leave out garbage because it attracts wild 
animals she said 
we hope to develop a system that has lions tolerating people 
and people tolerating lions demarest said

richard v secord refers to the irancontra 
prosecutors as this gang and yearns to go after the lawyers who 
prosecuted him for his role in setting up a private network to 
supply arms to the nicaraguan contras 
the prosecutors are none too fond of the retired air force major 
general either and would like to reinstate charges dropped in a 
plea bargain agreement 
still unclear is what impact the mutual rancor will have on 
secords role in the case against former national security adviser 
john m poindexter 
as far as i know im not on the witness list yet secord 
said in an interview in which he vented his anger at irancontra 
independent counsel lawrence walsh and his staff 
a day of reckoning is coming for this gang said secord 
but the retired military officer also conceded hes had little 
success raising money for the fund he established to go after 
walsh and challenge the ethics in government act secord said his 
ultimate goal is to overturn the law which authorizes appointment 
of special prosecutors 
secord 57 a native of columbus ohio flew bombing missions in 
southeast asia during the vietnam conflict he held a number of 
highranking positions at the pentagon before he retired a short 
squarejawed man with a wry sense of humor and a blunt way of 
talking secord can also be pugnacious when challenged 
after he pleaded guilty to making a false statement to 
congressional investigators he was expected to play a role in the 
prosecution of poindexter on charges of concealing facts from 
congress and lying about a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
a shipment in which secord was involved 
as part of a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors secord 
agreed to cooperate fully on future cases eleven other criminal 
charges were dropped and he walked away from the federal courthouse 
on jan 24 with a suspended sentence after paying 50 in court costs 
the day after secord was sentenced by us district judge aubrey 
robinson he filed an appeal on the grounds that walsh didnt have 
jurisdiction to prosecute for an offense arising out of secords 
testimony to congress 
walshs staff retaliated by claiming secord acted in bad 
faith by agreeing to plead guilty while all the time planning to 
challenge the plea 
prosecutors asked robinson to reinstate the 11 charges against 
secord 
asked why he filed an appeal and risked facing charges again 
secord said my wife asked me the same question she just wants 
it to end 
in the final analysis secord said he wants to repair his 
reputation 
my reputation has been so damaged by the special prosecutor 
this isnt a special prosecutor its a pr outfit 
secord said he hasnt seen the prosecutors in a month i 
havent even seen one of them though he said he had talked with 
them earlier 
that doesnt mean he wont be called to testify in a poindexter 
trial with these guys prosecutors you never know said the 
man who set up a private network to supply weapons to the 
nicaraguan contras at a time when congress had banned official us 
military aid for the rebels 
secord also arranged for the shipment of weapons to iran and 
directed companies into which profits from those sales were placed 
sam witucki a spokeswoman for walsh said prosecutors dont 
discuss witnesses and other details in advance of a trial 
as for the upcoming poindexter trial secord said he didnt have 
any contact with poindexter about the shipment of hawk missiles to 
iran in november 1985 
his name was never mentioned he said 
secord said he tried to arrange the shipment of the hawks from 
israel through portugal to iran at norths behest 
north called after talking to former national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane he said 
when mcfarlane resigned as the nsc adviser in december 1985 he 
was replaced by poindexter secord said the first time he met with 
poindexter was in january 1986 
the hawk shipment took place on mcfarlanes watch not 
poindexters secord said

increasingly open acts of antisemitism have 
scared thousands of soviet jews out of their homeland where they 
fear becoming targets of ethnic violence 
many immigrants arriving in israel speak of their fears even 
though most say they have not witnessed antisemitic acts or been 
personally threatened 
but they have read widely circulated antisemitic magazines and 
have seen reports in newspapers or on television referring to plans 
for pogroms by antijewish groups 
once we laughed at the rumors that there may be a pogrom 
said elena kopelevitch a 30yearold pianist from odessa who 
arrived in israel two weeks ago but now theres an antijewish 
hysteria and its like a snowball 
israeli officials expect as many as 750000 jews to eventually 
leave the soviet union because of more liberal exit policies 
while jews also are leaving to seek economic opportunity or 
because they doubt the new freedom in the soviet union will last 
racism is another factor 
immigrants noted attacks on armenians in the azerbaijani capital 
of baku in january and in uzbekistans fergana valley where uzbeks 
last june killed more than 100 meshkhetian turks 
in such cases authorities failed to protect the minorities the 
soviet jews say there is widespread fear the jewish minority would 
not be protected in case of trouble they say 
we have not witnessed any direct antisemitism but we lived in 
fear said elena kopelevitchs brother danny a student 
at the house of friends a mixed armenianjewish family ms 
kopelevitch said he met an armenian refugee from baku an 
85yearold woman who looked terrible she was covered with 
blue marks and bruises from beatings 
im still trembling as i recall it we did not want to wait 
for the same fate she said 
antisemitism is not a new experience for soviet jews in the 
late 1940s and early 1950s josef stalin ordered leading soviet 
jewish writers and actors killed and initiated antisemitic trials 
an antizionist campaign with clear antisemitic overtones 
also followed the soviet unions break in diplomatic ties with 
israel after the 1967 middle east war 
much of the governmentsponsored antisemitism has disappeared 
in the five years of president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms but 
liberalized rules also have unleashed grassroots antisemitism 
vladimir nosenko of moscows insitute of world economy and 
international relations visiting israel pointed to unofficial 
antisemitism as a cause for jewish fears 
imagine a country where emerging movements and parties accuse 
the jews of causing all the trials and tribulations of the natives 
and call for the extermination of jewish dominance for the sake 
of a better future he wrote in the jerusalem post 
nosenko said that several periodicals specialize in publishing 
material which plays on antijewish emotion 
much of the open antisemitism is spearheaded by factions of 
nationalpatriotic pamyat front 
a pamyat manifesto reported by the newpaper soviet circus in 
october said stalins repressions in the 1930s were zionist 
genocide that killed more people in our country than in all the 
wars of mankind 
last week the weekly literaturnaya gazeta said moscow 
prosecutors have begun criminal proceedings against pamyat on 
charges of inciting national and racial hatred and strife 
it is very frightening to be a jew in the soviet union these 
days said kira nefyodova a chemist from leningrad 
soviet jews were particularly worried by a jan 18 attack on 
april a liberal group of soviet writers about 50 pamyat activists 
holding signs saying moscow is not tel aviv broke into an april 
meeting 
according to a tape transcript printed by the liberal ogonyok 
weekly a pamyat member who identified himself as smirnov shouted 
at the writers through a megaphone 
yids and masons get out of the hall comrade jews leave 
the hall your time has ran out and neither police nor kgb or 
the party will help you now we shall rule the country and you 
aliens get out to israel 
participants in the april meeting later complained that police 
took no action 
nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel who visited moscow last 
month has said that in his six visits he had never seen jews 
living and dwelling in such fear 
wiesel called on gorbachev to personally condemn the growing 
antisemitism but no government condemnation followed in private 
meetings soviet leaders assured some western guests they would not 
tolerate any pogroms 
maya kaganskaya a sovietborn author and researcher on 
antisemitism affiliated with jerusalems hebrew university said 
soviet authorities cannot openly condemn antisemitic forces that 
seem to enjoy mass support 
these people are supported by hundreds of thousands while 
there is no social base for the socalled liberals she said in 
an interview 
therefore the authorities want to the remove explosive 
material the jews by encouraging them to leave she said they 
dont want russia covered with jewish blood

it looks as if rocky balboa has lost his 
bout with philadelphias art museum 
the 8foot 6inch statue of the fictional south philadelphia 
palooka is scheduled to leave its spot atop the philadelphia museum 
of art steps monday for its former home at the spectrum arena 
museum spokeswoman sandra horrocks said sunday 
the statue of rocky in boxing trunks and gloves his arms raised 
in triumph was moved from the spectrum for the filming of the 
latest chapter in sylvester stallones rocky saga producers of 
rocky v had agreed to remove the statue a prop made for 
rocky iii by monday 
but stallone and fans of the underdog boxer tried to persuade 
the museum to keep the bronze cast on the spot made so famous in 
the original rocky that tourists regularly run up the steps and 
hop around the plaza in rocky fashion 
polls by a local tv station and a newspaper show residents about 
equally split on the issue mayor w wilson goode came out in favor 
of leaving the statue put saying it serves as a great tourist 
attraction 
stallone hired a lawyer former state boxing commissioner james 
binns to try to persuade the fairmount park commission which 
oversees the museum to allow the statue to stay binns was 
returning from venezuela on sunday and could not immediately be 
reached for comment 
but art museum officials say the statue is out of place 
president robert montgomery scott said it looks puny in front of 
the big grecoroman building and its columns 
art museum officials said the statue was to be moved by jan 31 
but that deadline was extended to allow additional filming for the 
movie 
the statue has been moved between the sports arena and the 
museum for almost eight years it was made by the a thomas 
schomberg foundry in 1981 for the rocky sequel and left there 
after the movie opened in 1982 
that time museum officials said stallone failed to remove the 
statue as agreed and the museum had to pay 12000 to move it to 
the spectrum

x x x multilateral fora 
q inaudible 
chancellor kohl just a second let me say something about this 
because this is a very central question i am grateful that was 
put the question of german unity is a question of self right of 
selfdetermination and all peoples of this earth have the right of 
selfdetermination its part of the charge of the united nations 
it corresponds to the principles of csce it corresponds to the 
major democratic traditions of our world in all documents all 
treaties which have been concluded with the federal republic the 
will to refind reform the your idea of the german nation had 
always been confirmed the second point is that the people in the 
two parts of germany do want to unify want to overcome the 
articles of division the people in the gdr in a peaceful 
revolution i think the most peaceful revolution of history have 
made it clear that they want it by shouting we are the people 
we are one people now if i have a particular feeling seeing and 
hearing this and i believe that we do have a responsibility to be 
conscious of the fact that we are situated geographically 
speaking in the center of europe we have a certain history we 
must understand that there are certain fears on the part of our 
neighbors and im talking about serious fears and not only the 
pretended fears because there are people who pretend they have 
fears but what they mean is that they fear the economic power of a 
federal republic plus gdr the president very rightly said last 
year the federal republic was 40 years of age in the course of 40 
years it was a loyal and reliable partner in human rights and the 
defense of freedom in 1983 i put my political existence at stake 
by agreeing that arms be deployed nato arms american arms and 
missiles be deployed on german soil so nobody has to tell me 
what a reliable partner is but i do take all the other data into 
consideration and ive also made it clear thats part of my 
answer to you that i am amongst those who want to pursue 
political union of europe the federal government is a government 
which is ready to delegate further competences to the european 
parliament in other words we want this united germany to be ever 
more embedded in an integration process with its neighbors so 
nobody needs to be afraid and as regards the economic strength i 
can only say that the european community has been able to draw a 
great advantage of the economic strength of the federal republic 
and will be able to draw even more advantage from the economic 
strength of a united germany 
q im sorry did you recognize 
president bush i did but go ahead take the two 
q mr president id like to know perhaps the core question do 
you trust that germany will never become an aggressive resurgent 
military power and if i might ask mr kohl mr kohl do you 
foresake such a posture 
president bush i have stated that the us position is that we 
welcome unification and clearly that would not be the position if 
we held the fears that your question alluded to i do think that 
one way to help with stability not in relation to this question 
but european peace and stability is to have a strong nato and to 
have us troops if wanted stationed in europe but our policy 
if i shared the fears that youre talking about clearly we would 
might well have a different policy norm i let me take 
this one chancellor because i recognized two at once and the 
q offmike to chancellor kohl how durable can we see the 
commitment to nato and the continued presence of us troops on 
german soil given the broad support in the federal republic right 
now for a neutral unified germany given the probable outcome of 
the east german elections and given some of the political pressures 
that you may come under later this year with elections in december 
chancellor kohl its my affair these elections in the federal 
republic of germany in december and im looking forward to them 
very calmly a moment ago i gave you the example had i been 
standing here in the autumn in the fall of 1982 or in january 
1982 most of your colleagues would have doubted that the germans 
would deploy we did deploy american missiles and that is why i 
really dont think we need to be told what reliability means 
neutralism would be a very false solution for us i dont i 
cant see that there would ever be any majority in the federal 
republic nor in a united germany for a neutralized germany i think 
we have learned lessons and we do not want to repeat the errors of 
history but one mistake in the times of the weimar republic of 
course was that germany was isolated in europe one must make 
germany a part of the whole 
q how would you assess the results of your rest of question 
untranslated and i would like to ask the same question to the 
president 
chancellor kohl i dont think that this was our subject really 
actually i must say i dont quite understand this discussion on 
who accelerates and who does the contrary at one point in time i 
proposed these ten points at that time the situation was quite 
different in november and that is only a couple of weeks back we 
had thought that on the path towards germany unity we would be 
able to take certain steps that we would have an opportunity of 
concluding this contractual community first and then go have 
further joint structures and then have a confederation it is the 
attitude of the people in gdr and their exodus which has 
accelerated things you must consider the fact that between the 
first of january and today some 110000 people have left the gdr 
to come over to the federal republic i think that equals the 
figure of inhabitants of philadelphia in the matter of eight weeks 
so this movement must be stopped that is why i made this offer of 
concluding a monetary union in order to stop this movement in 
order to hold people back in order to make them stay at home if 
you ask me we now need a possibility of proceeding along this path 
towards unity stepbystep with good judgment we need this for 
ourselves we also need this because of our neighbors because the 
dynamism which has been caused now has been caused by the people in 
gdr but not because anybody wanted to accelerate that movement i 
do hope that in a few days that is to say shortly after the 18th 
of march the newly elected parliament will soon form a government 
with whom we can agree on how we want to proceed but i am not 
interested in this being so very fast

x x x very fast 
president bush he asked gentlemen the german press asked 
that i guess i thought he said for both of us to comment on the 
nature of the of the talks you know in diplomacy they always 
say full and frank and you can interpret that any way that you 
want but the benefit of this kind of meeting for me is you can 
talk in a very informal setting about any subject at all and the 
relationship that i have personally with chancellor kohl and that 
the federal republic has with the united states enables us to talk 
very frankly but what i come out with in addition to this 
statement that i made is the importance to keep our allies 
involved i believe the chancellor shares with me the importance of 
the united states and the soviet union staying in very close touch 
i know he shares with me the importance of our making progress with 
the soviets on arms control and on other areas so as this meeting 
winds down it was extraordinarily frank we can talk as one does 
with friends but we have so much common ground here including how 
were looking at unification and including the need to be sure 
that it doesnt look like either one of us is dictating to allies 
security arrangements or anything else for the future so it was a 
very good meeting 
q mr president i wonder if each of you gentlemen could comment 
on whether you would anticipate that a reunited germany will see 
fit to develop an independent nuclear weapons capability 
chancellor kohl no this discussion is over in germany we are 
not at all longing for atomic to be an atomic power 
q mr president 
president bush yes 
q mr president if i could follow up on a question you were 
actually asked a week or two ago about who about who the enemy 
is these days it seems that less and less it is the soviets so 
would one purpose of having keeping nato intact and keeping us 
troops within nato in germany be to as some analysts have said 
to keep the germans down 
president bush no the enemy is unpredictability the enemy is 
instability and it is for that reason that we there are agreed 
security provisions and thats thats the answer to it who out 
here was smart enough to predict for fact certain the changes that 
have taken place any time in the last year certainly no one up 
here maybe chancellor kohl but not the president of the united 
states and so what what i think we want to do in a period of 
exciting change is to have a stable western europe the eastern 
european countries are throwing off the yoke of communism the 
policy of nato has prevailed the soviet union is engaged in 
dramatic change but nobody can predict for fact certain what will 
come and so what we want to do is use our good offices and our 
alignment with nato to help with stability and that is in the 
interest of the united states of america some are saying in our 
country and the chancellor and i talked about this well we 
ought to take all the troops out or some are saying take all 
soviet troops out and all us forces out of europe in my judgment 
that would not provide for a stable europe and so its back to 
your question the enemy is instability and unpredictability as 
this rapid change continues to unfold inside the soviet union and 
inside eastern europe 
chancellor kohl i would like to join up with this term 
instability i think this is one of the major tasks of all 
those responsible in east and west and its particularly true for 
us in germany we must do everything possible in order to avoid 
destabilization in europe in particular in eastern europe i will 
do whatever i can to respond to that aim as a matter of fact i do 
not only agree with the president on this but also with secretary 
general gorbachev regarding the relationship between nato and the 
federal republic you seem to have made a mistake on your calendar 
we are not this is not 1945 this is 1990 
q mr chancellor 
q mr president on the going back to what you were saying 
before about keeping allies informed would you like to see a nato 
summit called together to discuss the unification 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
x x x the unification 
president bush well i will let chancellor kohl also respond to 
that i dont think at this juncture we need a nato summit jim 
baker just had a very successful and forwardlooking meeting up in 
ottawa and i dont i wouldnt say that whats called for now is 
a nato summit were talking about a csce summit provided theres 
a cfe agreement i have as the chancellor knows and we discussed 
this a oneonone meeting with mr gorbachev in the late spring 
we have a g7 meeting so weve got all kinds of consultative 
mechanisms set up in addition to the twoplusfour and therell be 
a lot of bilateral talks and maybe the chancellor would like to 
respond about the need for nato in concert to do more but the big 
point is keep each other informed and i dont think it has to be 
done at a nato summit because i think most nato allies share common 
ground theres a concern here or a different suggestion there but 
generally speaking i think were pretty much on the same 
wavelength with our allies did you 
chancellor kohl i fully agree with what the president has just 
said but let me elaborate on that what is happening now to many 
is a suprisingly new situation including for those who have always 
talked about it but never thought the day would really come now 
the day is coming that is why it is so important that we talk to 
one another as much as possible so that there be no mistrust and 
that is particularly i agree that this is not the time to convene a 
nato summit but i do agree that we need many detailed 
conversations within the european community on the 28th of april 
we will have an informal summit an extra summit just as we have 
had it in paris in the beginning of december the forthcoming one 
is going to take place in dublin ireland now having the 
presidency i will inform people there i will also be at the 
disposal of the representatives of the nato member states i have 
had and i will be having a number of contacts not long ago i met 
with my italian luxembourg dutch colleagues in italy before i 
came here i called my friend mulroney i had a long telephone 
conversation with him what matters to me is that we make it clear 
that we play very frankly and fairly and want to cooperate with all 
our friends and partners and the result will be good 
q translation offmike and mr president do you think that 
at the end of a twoplusfour process there will be a peace treaty 
and that a peace treaty will then no longer be necessary 
chancellor kohl i can give a very simple answer to your first 
to the first part of your question yes 
president bush and we agree with that and eventually the four 
powers that were set up right at the end of the war thatll have 
to be resolved whether it requires a formal treaty or something of 
that nature im not sure but there will be a resolution so there 
will not be a continued need for this fourpower arrangement 
looking over the shoulders of a democratic unified germany on the 
aisle back here 
chancellor kohl just a minute he wasnt next that one 
q mr chancellor what needs to be done in the event that the 
soviet union will not agree to germany being a member of nato 
chancellor kohl we talked about many things and also about 
what we want to discuss we need to discuss with the soviet union 
president bush we will do what lyndon johnson did we will 
reason together and itll all work out yes on the aisle 
q mr president with apologies to your guest a question on 
another subject if daniel ortega is elected in nicaragua today 
will the united states deal with him as the legitimate leader of 
nicaragua what will your policy be sir 
president bush the policy will be right short range to wait 
and see how free how fair the election is i dont know whether 
this is going live into managua but the last thing i want to do is 
make any hypothesis about the a victory of that sort because our 
view is wed be better off with those who have professed democracy 
as the route to go and so i will cross that bridge however when 
we get there however let me say this if these elections are 
certifiably free and fair it will whoever wins the election 
will find a better climate in which to improve relations with 
nicaragua weve had difficulty because nicaragua has said that 
theyre not giving arms to the fmln now they say well if were 
elected we wont give arms to the fmln we there are certain 
things that are unacceptable not just to the united states but to 
other countries in this hemisphere so weve got to see where we 
go but clearly a free and fair election that is certified as such 
in spite of the shortcomings that have reported to me by observers 
would be very very helpful in this relationship

x x x this relationship 
q would if i may follow would such an election call for a us 
response an american initiative 
president bush well again its too hypothetical because weve 
got to know not only how an election works out but we also need to 
know what follows on i thought the secretary of state put it very 
well in testimony before congress the other day when he said 
look theres got to be a period of establishing he didnt 
put it this way but i will a bonifides and i would cite the 
fmln is one clear area where there should be change a democratic 
process is important but what follows on in terms of freedom of 
the press freedom of institutions there freedom to protest 
freedom to speak your mind is also important and so all ill say 
is that whoever wins that election if it is certifiably free and 
fair thats good thats a positive thing and we would certainly 
take that into strong consideration the will of the people having 
been expressed as we determine what steps next to take but i 
would love to see nicaragua living peacefully within its own 
borders not trying to subvert its neighbors and giving its people 
a shot at democracy and once all that was sorted out why you can 
i can guarantee you thered be better relations with nicaragua 
q chancellor you talked about elections in december seeing the 
developments in germany can you foretell that it will be a federal 
election or an allgerman election 
chancellor kohl i do assume that we will have a federal 
election as it corresponds to the constitution 
q have you talked about nuclear shortrange missiles over the 
weekend 
chancellor kohl we have talked about how the process should be 
developed in the near future and how we will what decisions 
well take with regard to the decisions taken in brussels spring 
last year 
president bush offmike over here 
q mr president you said you were surprised that perhaps unity 
was coming sooner than you yourself had expected do you believe 
that those of your other allies within europe who are cautious 
about the pace of that unity are wrong illinformed or do they 
not understand what you have been talking about 
president bush i think they will rejoice in the agreements in 
what weve said here today i can understand individuals looking at 
a problem in a different way but i can tell you that the alliance 
is pretty firmly together on the security matters i think theyre 
going to be very firmly together on what the chancellor has said 
here today about said again about nato membership and so i 
dont i can understand individual countries wanting 
clarification or raising questions this doesnt trouble us at all 
i have stated the united states position and i will keep 
restating it and i will be discussing this with with our 
allies but look none of our allied leaders have predicted the 
rapidity of this change or the dynamics of the change in eastern 
europe and so were all trying to sort it out but the main point 
is not that there is not nuances of difference but that there 
is so much common ground as the way we look at the problems and as 
the way we look at it with the federal chancellor 
q mr president 
president bush yeah back here in the middle 
q the questions for both leaders i noticed in your opening 
remarks you were more specific than the chancellor in referring to 
nato i wonder if thats an indication that there is some 
discussion or perhaps some sentiment among the germans that nato 
may somehow fade away or be transformed into a different kind of 
european security arrangement and whether that was discussed to 
speak of

miners return to work monday at pittston 
coal group after a violent 10month strike in virginia kentucky 
and west virginia with both sides saying it will take time for 
tensions to ease 
the 1700 miners who had been fighting the company as well as 
the replacement workers and supervisors who kept it running during 
the strike on feb 19 ratified a settlement reached new years eve 
in washington 
some miners returned to work friday but officials said most 
will be coming back for the first time on monday 
its going to be odd going back miner buford mullins said 
i dont think things can be as they were before the strike its 
going to take a while 
pittston president michael odom said there will be some 
tensions we will have to deal with but he said the union 
employees struck with enthusiasm and probably will come back to 
work with enthusiasm 
violence erupted sporadically during the strike replacement 
workers and supervisors were often pelted with rocks as they drove 
to work and verbally abused when they went to town 
the new contract gives union members the job security and health 
and retirement benefits they sought and gives pittston the ability 
to run the mines seven days a week

x x x speak of 
president bush well we ourselves jerry have talked about a 
broader or a slightly different role clearly this stability 
through the military aspects is part of it but weve talked and 
we talked up here with manfred woerner the other day about a 
broader role for nato but i dont feel at the end of these talks 
that the chancellor and i are looking at this differently ill let 
him if there are some nuances there let him say so but i dont 
think so 
chancellor kohl i can only say this is a very natural thing 
that seeing the dramatic changes in the world with which were 
confronted think only of the warsaw pact and its present 
situation we are talking with the warsaw pact nato versus 
warsaw pact united states versus soviet union we are talking 
about our future manfred woerner when he was here indicated 
quite rightly so that the political importance of the nato 
alliance will increase and i think this is important and there 
are quite a few people including in the reformed states of central 
and east europe who do not feel threatened by nato at all but who 
consider nato as a fortress of stability and security and one has 
to take that into consideration when one talks about future 
development im quite optimistic there without developing these 
ideas further we will not make any headway in disarmament and 
this year we do have the good chance of being able to make headway 
in disarmament i do not think that this is the time for pessimism 
q mr chancellor the desire on both of your parts to have a 
unified germany remain in nato you also said that there should 
be some kind of special arrangements to guarantee provide 
certain guarantees security guarantees for eastern europe and 
the soviet union does that preclude any participation at all with 
a unified germany visavis the warsaw pact and would it be 
conceivable that there could actually be soviet troops in a unified 
germany 
chancellor kohl one thing is clear a united germany cannot 
belong to two different pact systems the other point is a question 
of sovereignty we will have transition situations and that is the 
subject about which one has to negotiate at present there are 
380000 soliders of the soviet army seeing the reductions one has 
agreed upon half of that number will be remaining there for the 
time being many things will have to be looked into and i cannot 
and will not give any final position here a united germany that 
much is clear has a sovereignty of its own has its own 
sovereignty that is quite clear but then in the transition 
period one can still think about things which will be helpful 
q can you give any more details about what you discussed in 
terms of providing these security assurances beyond what youve 
said so far 
chancellor kohl i dont think that is what a press conference 
is about because we first must negotiate and then have a press 
conference about the results 
president bush let me ask i noticed mr fitzwater looking 
that we may have overextended our time would it be agreeable 
chancellor kohl if we each took one more question 
chancellor kohl in german 
q mr president can you envisage a situation where us troops 
are still deployed in germany while the soviet union has withdrawn 
all its troops from german soil 
president bush yes i can and the reason i can envisage such a 
situation is that if thats what the germans want thats what 
ought to happen and we are not the us troops are not in europe 
against the will of any single country in which theyre deployed 
not one and the soviet troops have been for years inside the 
territory of countries that havent wanted them this is a 
fundamental difference so my answer is yes i can so envision 
q mr chancellor both of you have talked about us troops and 
soviet troops but id like to ask a question about germanys own 
troops both the federal republic and east germany the gdr have 
substantial armies i know a final decision about those armies 
wont be made until a united germany is formed but as you look 
ahead whats your personal audio break to retain an army 
of this size or in the future will it be likely that those forces 
will be scaled down 
chancellor kohl let me say first of all thats the question of 
the strength of forces which concerns us directly but this 
question must be embedded in the overall situation the overall 
security development and i do hope very much that in the area of 
disarmament we will advance in leaps and bounds and do i hope that 
we germans will be able to profit from that that is why that 
why today i cannot answer that question in particular since im 
not the representative of an allgerman state and i cannot tell 
you at all in what dimensions a future german state would conceive 
of these things in this question as well one has to consider the 
effects that that will have that the answer will have on all our 
neighbors i have spontaneously answered to the questions put to me 
by one of your colleagues he asked did we want to have nuclear 
arms and i spontaneously said no and that is of greatest 
importance there shouldnt be any fears in that direction by 
the way this and many other questions i consider to be able to be 
solved we have had more difficult questions to solve if i 
consider legal questions of private property in gdr the social 
structure so the task ahead of us is enormous and that is again 
why i plead it shouldnt be under time pressure but we should be 
advancing and solving these problems step by step 
president bush thank you all very very much

a smoking ban on virtually all domestic us flights took effect 
sunday amid both relief and grumbling and the phrase smoking or 
nonsmoking all but disappeared from the lips of ticket agents 
if the plane starts to go down im lighting one up said 
dave noeth of new york city a traveler at laguardia airport 
the federal ban in force since 1988 on flights of less than two 
hours now applies to 998 percent of domestic flights the only 
exception being flights to alaska and hawaii of more than six 
hours overseas fights are not affected 
its wonderful its for the health of everyone said 
eastern airlines flight attendant nancy roberson of charleston 
sc i think there are more pleased people than not all the 
passengers tell me about it 
michael barnett an eastern ticket agent in miami said the 
elimination of smoking and nonsmoking sections made his life a bit 
easier now we just issue seats he said 
supporters of the ban say separate smoking sections do not 
adequately shield nonsmoking passengers and crew members from 
cigarette smoke critics argue that smokers rights are being 
trampled on 
i dont think its fair said gail fiore of huntington 
ny as she arrived at laguardia i pay the same fare as a 
nonsmoker and there should be a section for it theyre giving all 
the nonsmokers all the rights and taking away all of ours 
added her husband hugo even in the service they gave you a 
10minute smoke break 
other smokers took a more resigned approach even if nicotine 
withdrawal pangs are likely to bring new meaning to the term 
whiteknuckle flying 
if they say you dont smoke you dont smoke said rich 
meadows of ridgecrest calif as he awaited a chicagobound flight 
at los angeles international airport 
i dont care for it but thats the way it goes ill just 
take some chewing tobacco which makes the stewardesses mad its 
pretty disgusting but its something to do 
dan lauria a spokesman for the tobacco institute a lobbying 
group said last week that he had fielded many calls from 
miserable smokers 
we are telling the people the law is the law he said 
were telling people not to smoke in the bathroom its dangerous 
to the plane 
longtime smoker joanne sharples of omaha neb arriving in 
miami said she managed not to light up during the flight after 
about three hours you get those anxiety pangs but ive gone eight 
hours she said 
mrs sharples who said she has tried four times to quit smoking 
and plans to try again said she understands nonsmokers desire to 
breathe clean air 
i wish they would do the same thing for women who wear an 
abundance of perfume she said i can understand certainly a 
smokefree america a drugfree america and a perfumefree 
america 
matthew bowen who was traveling from atlanta to norfolk va 
to see his grandchildren said smokers must lobby to protect 
smoking areas he said airlines would listen if smokers threatened 
to take their money to competitors 
ive smoked three cigarettes this morning just waiting for the 
plane when i usually would smoke one he said he joked that he 
was storing up

the armed forces will receive new 
uniforms as part of an effort to dissociate them from the 
repressive rule of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
authorities were quoted as saying sunday 
the defense minister lt gen victor a stanculescu told the 
daily romania libera newspaper the uniforms would help give 
soldiers a new identity 
the military kept order during the repressive 24year tenure of 
ceausescu but sided with civilians during the revolt that toppled 
him in december 
an officer displayed the new uniforms for different branches of 
the armed forces sunday on a television program devoted to military 
affairs 
among other changes the new army officers uniforms have soft 
epaulets similar to those used in the west rather than the stiff 
detachable shoulder boards that are the style in warsaw pact 
countries 
soldiers going on public patrols will be assigned smart belted 
green jackets with shirts and ties rather than the pullovers and 
simple jackets currently issued the program said 
television showed shiny black shoes that soldiers would wear on 
patrol instead of combat boots and said furlined coats would be 
provided in winter instead of the old wool ones now used 
in a separate broadcast television also reported that police 
would receive new uniforms with a less militaristic look 
the new uniforms appeared to be another effort by the interim 
government to calm the restive armed forces which launched a week 
of demonstrations earlier this month demanding a purge of officers 
linked to ceausescu as well as the removal of the former defense 
minister nicolae militaru protesting soldiers also complained of 
poor food and other supplies and a lowly image 
in another response to the demands of young officers 
stanculescu announced that 20 generals who had been called out of 
retirement during the revolution had been removed from active duty 
romania libera reported 
the demonstrators had charged that the 74yearold militaru and 
other officers called out of retirement were part of the old order 
and were incapable of reforming the army 
stanculescu named defense minister after militarus resignation 
feb 16 has promised to work with the military to remove ceausescu 
loyalists 
the television said that military authorities would seek the 
troops suggestions on the new uniforms then order them 
it did not give a date or other details 
in central bucharest meanwhile about 50 people gathered around 
the base of a 15foothigh statue of lenin which a few 
demonstrators covered with posters that said were not robots 
and down with communism down with its false symbols 
a few police watched but did not interfere as the demonstrators 
denounced the government in heated conversations there is 
widespread suspicion that interim president ion iliescu and other 
leading members of the caretaker government who were former ranking 
communists still hold marxist beliefs despite the general 
consensus that communism is dead in romania 
one protester hurled a rock which hit the statues head with a 
loud hollow clang it is empty said an onlooker

prime minister yitzhak shamir is in no hurry to 
call a cabinet vote on compromise proposals for starting 
israelipalestinian talks despite reported us pressure for a 
quick decision an aide said sunday 
israeli newspapers and staterun radio reported that us 
secretary of state james a baker iii is pressing for answers this 
week on four key points holding up the peace process 
but shamir spokesman avi pazner said the prime minister has no 
plans to bring any compromise proposals to a vote at a scheduled 
meeting of the decisionmaking inner cabinet on wednesday 
asked about the pressure on shamir both from baker and from 
shamirs coalition partners in the centerleft labor party pazner 
replied he has overcome worse things 
he denied israeli news reports that shamir already has agreed to 
a compromise on the makeup of the palestinian delegation to an 
initial meeting that baker wants held in cairo egypt 
he said shamir would not consider compromise suggestions before 
a briefing by foreign minister moshe arens who met baker last week 
in washington arens returned sunday and was meeting shamir in tel 
aviv 
according to israeli media reports baker is insisting that 
israel accept as palestinian negotiators at least one resident from 
arab east jerusalem and at least one who was deported by israel 
from the occupied territories 
including a deportee reportedly is intended to meet plo demands 
that outside palestinians be represented while at the same time 
satisfying israels insistence that it will talk only to residents 
of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the issue of east jerusalem is complicated because israel 
annexed the area into its capital after capturing it in the 1967 
middle east war the plo considers east jerusalem the capital of 
its desired palestinian state 
another reported point of bakers plan is that egypt would 
announce the palestinian delegation the plo had demanded that it 
make the announcement but israeli newspapers said baker is asking 
israel to drop demands for ironclad assurances that the plo will 
not be involved in the peace process at some later point 
egypt and the plo have reportedly agreed to these conditions 
leaving the future of the peace contacts up to israel 
two newspapers davar and maariv quoted an unidentified 
official in washington as saying bakers demands werent an 
ultimatum but not far from it 
davar aligned with the labor party said that unless israel 
accepted bakers four points the united states may drop support 
for israels plan for palestinian elections 
meanwhile the labor party stepped up pressure on shamir sunday 
by refusing to approve two cabinet appointees from the prime 
ministers likud bloc unless shamir also agrees to return science 
minister ezer weizman a labor member to the inner cabinet 
weizman was ousted in january over allegations that he had 
illegal contacts with plo officials but israeli judicial officials 
have since said there is no evidence to prosecute him 
last week labor leaders threatened to quit the likudlabor 
coalition unless the cabinet accepts compromises to start peace 
talks by march 7 labor head shimon peres repeated the threat on 
sunday 
in the occupied lands meanwhile palestinians staged a general 
strike to protest the alleged arson of a mosque last month in a 
west bank village the strike was called by the moslem 
fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal 
a 20yearold palestinian from the gaza strip town of rafah 
vahel jamil el hams died at israels tel hashomer hospital after 
being shot in the back by troops arab reports said 
the army confirmed the death and said it was checking the 
circumstances 
his death raised to 659 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians during the 26monthold uprising in 
the occupied lands some 189 palestinians have been killed by 
fellow arabs on suspicion of collaborating with israel and 43 
israelis have also been slain

a democratic candidate for governor who 
borrowed the republicans willie horton strategy was forced to 
apologize after the tactic was denounced as racist and prejudicial 
to a defendant 
gubernatorial hopeful rep bill nelson kicked off his campaign 
feb 14 by promising to make a florida case involving a black 
defendant into his rivals willie horton only worse on 
friday he issued his apology 
the sixterm congressman is considered the frontrunner among 
the three democrats seeking a chance to challenge firstterm 
republican gov bob martinez martinez also has three republican 
challengers 
horton who had spent 10 years in prison in massachusetts for 
murder escaped during a furlough in 1987 and raped a maryland 
woman and assaulted her fiance a commercial during president 
bushs 1988 campaign blamed democrat michael dukakis for the 
tragedy and was credited as a major factor in the massachusetts 
governors defeat 
the ad pictured horton a black man which critics said was a 
tactic to stir racial fears when nelson likened a florida police 
slaying to the horton case the same charges arose 
nelson sought to blame martinez for the case of charles street 
who is accused of killing two dade county police officers in 1988 
10 days after he was released from prison early because of 
overcrowding 
the officers were killed after they went to subdue a man seen 
throwing rocks police said the officers killer took a revolver 
away from one of them and fired at least seven shots wounding them 
in the head and shoulders above their bulletproof vests 
street had just finished serving eight years of a 15year 
attemptedmurder sentence for shooting a man outside a bar he has 
a 20page criminal record that includes numerous charges of 
assaulting police officers 
at the time corrections officials said street served more time 
than average for a 15year sentence because of frequent infractions 
in prison but they also said he got out nearly two years earlier 
than he otherwise would have because of an earlyrelease program 
proposed by martinez in 1987 to help ease prison overcrowding 
at a campaign kickoff held at the site of the slayings nelson 
predicted martinez is going to have his hide nailed to the wall 
on the street case martinez declined to respond to the charge but 
others criticized nelsons strategy 
former us district judge alcee hastings the only black 
candidate in the race stopped short of calling his fellow democrat 
a racist but said he thought nelson had hurt himself with black 
voters 
i hope it will cause people to realize that youre seeing 
flapdoodle and stumblebum campaigns said hastings who entered 
the race just three days after he was impeached and removed from 
the bench last year 
i have no personal reason to believe he is a racist it seems 
to me he was doing a ploy to get attention hastings said 
in an unusual move circuit judge alfonso c sepe who is 
presiding over streets case warned nelson in a letter that making 
street a cause celebre in the 1990 governors race could prejudice 
the murder trial 
my interest is in guaranteeing mr street a fair trial sepe 
wrote we are hoping to avoid the kind of pretrial publicity that 
would contaminate a jury required to try a presumably innocent 
man 
although democrats howled loudly in 1988 that the bush ad was 
racist and unethical nelson was defended by national democratic 
party chairman ron brown who argued democrats must learn to fight 
fire with fire 
on balance anybody that takes an objective look at dirty 
politics in this country the republicans are the champion said 
brown 
browns gop counterpart lee atwater considered a pioneer in 
modern negative campaigning said he didnt know much about 
nelsons statements and didnt want to comment he said he was 
following the axiom never interfere with your enemy while he is 
in the process of destroying himself 
in his apology nelson said he would continue to question 
floridas earlyrelease program but he added the linkage of 
charles street to willie horton was a mistake because of the 
racial implications that is a mistake for which i apologize 
in the heat of a campaign there are going to be mistakes 
and missteps nelson said this campaign has heated up very 
early 
the gubernatorial primary will be held sept 4

the leader of the sajudis reform 
movement said sunday that independence for lithuania could be 
achieved this year after his group claimed a landslide victory in 
the soviet unions first multiparty election 
in balloting for the baltic republics 141seat parliament 
saturday voters appeared to have chosen the countrys first 
legislature not dominated by communists 
the main contenders were the sajudis popular front which has 
led the drive for independence and the reformed lithuanian 
communist party 
on the street outside the sajudis headquarters passersby 
gathered excitedly around posters announcing the victory 
unofficial returns showed that of the 90 races decided 
sajudisendorsed candidates took 72 seats and nonsajudis 
candidates took 18 said rita dapkus head of the sajudis 
information agency 
if that is not a landslide then what is algimantas 
cekuolis a sajudis officer said at a news conference sunday it 
is a very clear indication of what the people of lithuania think 
sajudis gathered the election results by calling local election 
commissions and the tallies were believed to be reliable official 
results were not expected until monday 
mrs dapkus said 45 races had no majority winner and will be 
decided by runoff votes on march 10 while six were invalidated by 
insufficient voter turnout or other factors they will be decided 
in april 
turnout among the 256 million eligible voters was about 75 
percent officials said 
vytautus landsbergis sajudis chairman said the results showed 
lithuanians trust his movement 
we have a common and very clear goal our clear goal is 
statehood and the independence of lithuania he said this goal 
is achievable this year 
the new parliaments chief task will be navigating the baltic 
republics difficult course to secession from the soviet union 
sajudis wants talks with moscow to prepare for an orderly 
secession which would break a 50yearold tie that began with 
lithuanias occupation by the red army in 1940 and its annexation 
later that year 
the movement supports a neutral sovereign lithuania 
characterized by a market economy and guarantees for human and 
cultural rights 
although sajudis dominated the voting landsbergis did not rule 
out a strong role for the reformed communists in a coalition 
government selected by the new parliament he stressed the close 
ties between sajudis and reformminded communist party members 
probably we will not ignore the party as an administrative 
power and partner said landsbergis who easily won election as a 
parliament deputy from northern lithuania 
but he said the hardline communists who oppose independence 
would probably not be welcome in the coalition 
the participation by sajudis and at least six other parties in 
parliamentary elections was a first in the soviet union in 
december lithuania became the first of the 15 soviet republics to 
legalize noncommunist parties 
the reform communists won 22 seats but 13 of those were in 
districts where they were backed by sajudis 
candidates from the lithuanian chapter of the communist party of 
the soviet union which remains loyal to moscow and opposes full 
independence won seven seats two nonparty independents also won 
seats without sajudis backing 
the communist winners included the partys first secretary and 
lithuanian president algirdas brazauskas who in december defied 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and led his party to split with 
moscow 
among the 72 sajudis winners were 46 independents 13 reform 
communists nine social democrats two greens and two christian 
democrats 
moldavians voted sunday in their first free elections under 
soviet rule and expressed hopes their new parliament would be able 
to win greater sovereignty from moscow 
the main challenger to the communists in moldavia was the 
moldavian popular front which likes to compare itself to sajudis 
the red army occupied lithuania in june 1940 in accordance with 
the secret terms of the ribbentropmolotov pact in which nazi 
germany and the soviet union divided central europe between 
themselves 
lithuanias old parliament was coerced into voting to join the 
soviet union the next month and lithuania was formally annexed by 
the soviets on aug 24 1940 
lithuania had emerged as an independent state in 1918 with the 
collapse of the russian empire in world war i

years of fighting among black factions in natal province appealed 
to the warring groups sunday to put down their weapons and fight 
together for racial equality 
mandela released feb 11 after 27 years in prison still 
supports the lowlevel armed struggle waged by his african national 
congress guerrilla movement 
but he said the blackonblack fighting in the southeastern 
province hindered the battle against apartheid south africas 
policy of racial segregation 
even now as we stand together on the threshold of a new south 
africa natal is in flames mandela told an estimated 100000 
people who filled three adjacent soccer fields 
my message to those of you involved in this battle of brother 
against brother is this take your guns your knives and your 
pangas and throw them into the sea mandela said pangas are 
similar to machetes 
mandela and his wife winnie arrived by helicopter to rousing 
cheers he spoke from a 4storytall platform draped with huge 
flags of the anc and its ally the south african communist party 
many in the mostly black crowd waved the green black and gold 
banner of the african national congress and chanted anc anc 
about 3000 blacks mostly zulus have died since 1986 in the 
power struggle in natal the main combatants are the ancaligned 
united democratic front and inkatha a relatively conservative zulu 
political group headed by mangosuthu buthelezi 
buthelezi is a staunch oppenent of apartheid but he differs 
with the anc over the best way to fight it 
the anc favors sanctions boycotts strikes and guerrilla 
attacks to put pressure on the government buthelezi does not 
endorse any of these actions and is a proponent of capitalism in 
contrast to the socialistoriented anc 
while the most intense battles have been in the townships around 
durban and pietermaritzburg 50 miles inland the fighting has 
spread throughout natal 
several of mandelas anc colleagues including walter sisulu 
have been in natal since thursday meeting with leaders of the 
front inkatha and local clergymen 
mandela made several conciliatory remarks concerning inkatha and 
buthelezi whom he praised for demanding the anc be legalized and 
political prisoners be released president fw de klerk on feb 2 
legalized the anc which had been banned since 1960 
mandela also praised the zulu leader for refusing to negotiate 
with the whiteled government while other black groups were 
outlawed and their leaders imprisoned 
this stand of inkatha has contributed in no small measure to 
making it difficult for the white regime to implement successive 
schemes designed to perpetuate minority rule mandela said 
inkatha leaders took the unusual step of urging their supporters 
to attend the rally to hear mandela 
inkatha has long staged its own rallies separate from those in 
support of the front and the anc on numerous occasions violence 
has broken out when the crowd from one rally headed home through 
neighborhoods dominated by the other about 3000 marshals were on 
hand to prevent violence at the rally which lasted several hours 
as mandela spoke police reported that the bodies of six black 
youths were found at an abandoned church in empangeni 90 miles 
north of durban police said they were still investigating the 
attack which apparently took place saturday 
later sunday mandela spoke to tens of thousands of blacks in 
the central city of bloemfontein where he called on de klerk to 
dismiss defense minister magnus malan and suspend law and order 
minister adriaan vlok 
both men have come under heavy criticism following accusations 
that the security forces have been involved in the killings of 
dozens of antiapartheid activists in the past decade 
a judicial commission appointed by de klerk is investigating the 
charges 
mandela said the south african government had systematically 
undermined the rule of law with such measures as the 3yearold 
state of emergency 
we note with appreciation that there are certain areas where 
policemen are acting with restraint and fulfilling the role of 
protecting all our people mandela said but we view with 
horror the moral decay within certain sections of the security 
establishment

moldavians voted sunday in their first 
free elections under soviet rule and expressed hopes their new 
parliament would be able to win greater sovereignty from moscow 
many voters who gathered in parks after casting their ballots 
seemed excited by the prospect of a new government and the ability 
to choose candidates 
we are learning democracy and we want to use the parliament as 
a peaceful way to gain our sovereignty said anatoly zhdanov who 
said he was moldavian by nationality despite his russian name 
zhdanov a 26yearold employee in a brick factory said he 
voted for the moldavian popular front an independent political 
movement that was the main challenger to the ruling communist party 
in the contest for the 380 seats in the moldavian parliament 
of course we are going to win and then our demands will be 
met klavdia zhaloba said smiling as she sold copies of glasul 
an independent moldavian newspaper 
with more than 200 candidates on the ballot the popular front 
hoped to get at least 50 percent of the seats in parliament we 
think part of the other deputies will come around to our side 
said yuri roshka a popular front leader and candidate 
the moldavian popular front likes to compare itself to sajudis 
the lithuanian reform group which on sunday claimed victory in 
parliamentary elections it campaigned on a platform that favors 
secession from the soviet union 
we want to be an independent republic not with the russians 
and not with the romanians and above all we want our 
sovereignty anatoly goncharov said as he listened to news of 
election returns in lithuania on his radio in a park 
while lithuania enjoyed two decades of independence between the 
world wars moldavia a republic of 4 million people in the 
southwest corner of the soviet union has not known independence 
this century 
until the czarist empire fell apart in 1917 moldavia was the 
russian province of bessarabia and after world war i it was ceded 
to romania with which it shares a nearly identical language and 
many historical and cultural heroes 
moldavias common heritage with romania was suppressed when 
stalin annexed it to the soviet union in 1940 but a halfcentury 
of soviet domination failed to diminish the desire of many of the 
estimated 3 million ethnic moldavians to reunite with their 
neighbor 
demands for unity surged in moldavia when romanias december 
revolution toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
sympathy for romania is visible in the center of kishinev where 
a romanian flag is pasted on a statue of the romanian king stephan 
the great some residents wear romanian flags pinned on their 
lapels 
but the popular front says reunification should be put on hold 
for the moment in favor of rebuilding the republics economy and 
restoring moldavian culture stunted by decades of russification 
we want to unite with romania but it is not possible yet 
first we have to create a democratic system here and i think 
reunification should happen when there is a declaration of the will 
of the people roshka said 
the popular front said it would press for the right to engage in 
direct economic relations with other countries a multiparty 
political system private property and a market economy 
those kind of changes will take time especially if the popular 
front is unable to muster the twothirds vote in parliament that 
is required to amend the constitution 
even a new government may be unable to solve all the problems 
facing moldavia 
representatives of other ethnic groups accuse the popular front 
of whipping up ethnic sentiments that may make dialogue difficult 
in the future 
the russianspeaking population is very frightened said 
vladimir solonar a leader of the unity movement formed to protect 
the rights of russians ukrainians and jews many of whose families 
have lived in moldavia for generations 
the movement fielded candidates for each of the 65 districts in 
kishinev 
parliamentary elections were also held sunday in the central 
asian republic of tadzhikistan recently rocked by ethnic unrest in 
which at least 22 people died 
reports from the capital of dushanbe monitored in london said 
voting was orderly official radio put the voter turnout at 64 
percent and attributed the low turnout to the 6 pm curfew that 
has been in effect since feb 12 to prevent more unrest 
a parliamentary vote also took place sunday in neighboring 
kirghizia a mountainous republic on the border with china 
the official tass news agency said official results in both 
elections were expected to be announced march 1

president bush said sunday he and 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany agreed in weekend talks that 
a unified germany would continue as a full member of nato 
including military participation in the western alliance kohl said 
neutralism would be a very false solution 
after two days of discussions regarding delicate issues of a 
unified germany kohl said he recognizes the legitimate security 
interests of all states in europe particularly poland 
nobody needs to be afraid the west german leader said bush 
chimed in that if he were alarmed about the prospect of a single 
germany he would not be endorsing reunification as he had 
several times previously 
there have been fears in poland decimated by the nazis in 
world war ii that a new germany would seek to regain border 
territory that was formerly under german rule 
nonetheless bush and kohl both said they saw no need to add 
poland to the group of four nations that will dicuss reunification 
with the two german states poland like east germany has 
abandoned its communist monopoly government 
bush pointedly said that the united states regards the current 
european borders including germanys long border with poland as 
inviolable and kohl said the border question will be settled 
definitely by a free elected allgerman government he said 
nobody has any intention of linking the question of national 
unity with changes in existing borders 
east germany is a member of the sovietdominated warsaw pact 
and many in europe have supported the concept of a neutral germany 
rather than one allied with the united states and its nato allies 
east germany is abandoning its communist government and the 
germanys are pursuing a common currency based on the west german 
system 
neutralism would be a very false solution for us said kohl 
adding that he did not expect that the german people would support 
a move away from nato he said the west germans had proven their 
reliability by accepting missiles during the 1980s 
the security link between north american and europe is for 
a united germany of vital importance said kohl he reiterated 
his support for the continuing presence of us military forces in 
germany 
kohl said he understands the delicacy of the german 
reunification issue in several european countries but said 
nobody needs to be afraid of that 
kohl was asked whether soviet troops long based in east 
germany might be welcomed to stay in a new germany 
a unified germany cannot belong to two different security 
systems he said he was asked if germany might develop an 
independent nuclear weapons system and replied we are not at 
all longing to be an atomic power 
one other foreign policy issue surfaced the elections in 
nicaragua 
bush said whoever wins will find a better climate with 
the united states so long as the balloting was certified as free 
and fair and the resulting government maintains a democratic system 
the various questions of german reunification are at the center 
of the dramatic political upheavals that have engulfed europe over 
the past year bush and kohl talked about delicate issues that are 
heightened by concerns involving german aggression in two world 
wars 
the allies which defeated germany in world war ii the united 
states soviet union great britain and france have agreed to 
convene meetings that are likely to lead to a unified germany 
perhaps as soon as this year 
bush said the timetable was up to the germans he said he was 
neither trying to speed it up or slow it down 
if events are moving faster than we expected it just means our 
common goal of a unified germany will be achieved sooner than 
expected he said unification talks between east and west germany 
are to begin after east german elections march 18 
following two days of talks at camp david bush and kohl drove 
down from the presidential retreat to meet with reporters at a 
facility in camp greentop also in the catoctin mountain park 
bush and kohl took turns answering questions bush called their 
talks extraordinarily frank the two men alternated taking 
questions on a stage in a camping recreation hall 
given sweeping changes in the soviet union and the soviet bloc 
bush was asked to describe the enemy which necessitates military 
forces in europe 
the enemy is unpreditability said bush the enemy is 
instability and it is for that reason that there are agreed 
security provisions who out here was smart enough to predict 
the changes that have taken place over the past year 
he added what we want to do in a period of exciting change is 
to have a stable western europe eastern european countries are 
throwing off the yoke of communism the policy of nato has 
prevailed but nobody can predict for fact certain what will 
come and so what we want to do is use our good offices and our 
alignment with nato to help with stability 
bush acknowledged that some are saying we ought to take all 
the troops out commenting in my judgment that would not 
provide for a stable europe the enemy is instability and 
unpredictability as this rapid change continues to unfold inside 
the soviet union and inside eastern europe 
bush and kohl said they discussed difficult issues engendered by 
prospects of reunification of west and east germany one was 
whether the new germany would maintain its ties to nato and another 
involved border areas of poland which were part of prewar germany 
we do recognize the legitimate security interests of all 
states kohl said in his opening statement noting he was 
speaking specifically of poland 
there have been concerns that a unified germany would seek to 
regain control of some border areas and poland has asked to be 
included in unification talks 
bush said the united states supports treaties which reaffirm the 
current polandgerman borders but he agreed with kohl that there 
was no need to add poland to the fourplustwo group that will meet 
to discuss unification 
the two germanys are to begin unification talks after the march 
18 elections in east germanythen they will discuss external 
security issues with the four powers which defeated nazi germany in 
world war ii 
bush said its not for the united states to set a timetable 
its not for us to say how fast unification would occur 
others have raised concerns about reunification including ariel 
sharon israels former defense minister and a member of the 
israeli parliament asked on cbss face the nation if he was 
worried about reunification he replied 
yes of course we the jews we that suffered six million 
casualties dead by the germans we must be aware of that i 
think the free world including west germany should take all the 
necessary steps that such unification will not harm anymore not 
the free world and not the jews he said 
bush and kohl were joined by close advisers and the american 
side said the two german states should begin soon to consult with 
the four powers as they make progress in their reunification talks 
in parallel consultations before the formal twoplusfour talks 
begin 
both men said there was no need for an extra nato summit noting 
upcoming economic and nato meetings

a top iranian official said in an 
interview published sunday that his country opposes hostage taking 
and another report said groups holding foreigners in lebanon might 
let them go without the need for diplomatic pressure 
in an interview with the englishlanguage tehran times iranian 
chief justice and cleric ayatollah mohammad yazdi said iran 
opposes taking hostages terrorism and air piracy because these 
are contrary to islamic and humanitarian principles 
in the interview sent to the associated press by telefax yazdi 
also said iran recognizes international law and staunchly opposes 
any interference in the international affairs of other nations 
yazdis statements came amid other indications that the iranian 
government is distancing itself from proiranian groups in lebanon 
that are believed to hold the 18 westerners 
they include eight americans four britons an italian an 
irishman two west germans and two swiss the longest held is 
42yearold terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associted press when kidnapped in march 1985 
the persian daily ettelaat which has the secondlargest 
circulation in iran said in an editorial sunday that the groups 
holding the foreigners might free them 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted the paper as 
saying the lebanese moslem people who have been holding the 
western hostages since their captivity may choose to free them at 
their discretion without the need for diplomatic give and take 
the paper claimed that americans and other westerners do not 
really want to see the hostages freed because they have become a 
means of trying to discredit irans 1979 islamic revolution 
according to the news agency account monitored in nicosia 
the ettelaat editorial echoed a similar statement in the tehran 
times on thursday that said the hostages should be released without 
preconditions on islamic and humanitarian grounds it was the first 
such known statement by an iranian newspaper 
on friday sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah lebanons most 
influential shiite moslem cleric said the hostages were being used 
by the west to distort the image of islam and a means should be 
found to free them 
while many iranian officials have said in the past that the 
islamic republic opposed hostage taking iran had set preconditions 
for using its influence to try to get the hostages freed 
president hashemi rafsanjani said last year that the united 
states should release iranian assets frozen since the revolution if 
it wanted tehrans help with the hostages 
their freedom is believed linked to factional fighting within 
the iranian government there were signs this week that the power 
struggle is deepening between the pragmatists seeking a more open 
iran and the radicals who believe that contacts with the west will 
dilute the islamic revolution 
the main iranian oppostion group the mujahedeen khalq has said 
in statements from its baghdad headquarters this week that 
antigovernment riots have broken out in a number of iranian cities 
the reports could not be independently confirmed although the 
official news agency reported 30 arrests at a demonstration after 
cancellation of a soccer match

east german premier hans modrow agreed sunday 
to lead his party in march 18 elections giving the embattled 
communists a last chance at political survival 
according to recent opinion polls modrow remains the most 
popular politician in east germany despitehis affiliation with a 
party that has been disgraced and stripped of most of its former 
authority 
the leftist social democratic party is expected to poll a 
majority of votes in east germanys firstever free elections 
followed by the more conservative christian democrats 
but modrows decision to stay with his party could boost the 
communists chances of retaining at least a minor role in the next 
leadership 
modrow told the 530 delegates at an east berlin convention of 
his party for democratic socialism that he would lead it in the 
march vote although it wasnt easy to make up his mind the 
official adn news agency said 
the 62yearold politician had been waffling over the leadership 
issue for several days he is apparently reluctant to become a 
scapegoat for four decades of communist economic mismanagement 
which the bonn government claims has brought east germany to the 
brink of ruin 
but modrow a member of the ruling politburo from 1958 until the 
communist party disbanded that body and changed its name last 
december enjoys widespread support as a reformer and is the 
partys most likely votegetter 
for all the things i tried to do for a policy of reform in 
1989 and maybe even earlier i now know very well that it wasnt 
enough adn quoted modrow as saying 
all leading east german parties have ruled out building 
coalition governments with the communists 
ibrahim boehme leader of the social democrats said modrow was 
a good candidate but unfortunately for the wrong party 
modrow has been premier since november when a new cabinet was 
seated following the ouster of hardline erich honecker and his top 
lieutenants most of whom are now under investigation for alleged 
corruption and misuse of office 
polls have predicted boehmes party will emerge with the biggest 
bloc of votes in the elections but it is unclear whether the 
social democrats will be able to build a government on their own 
west german officials have speculated the vote may be so divided 
the new 400member parliament could abandon efforts to build a 
cabinet and instead vote for immediate merger with west germany 
if a new government is formed it is expected to open talks with 
bonn immediately on how to bail out the economy 
meanwhile adn reported the east german chief prosecutors 
office was investigating honecker for allegedly directing 455 
million in government funds to a hard currency bank account to 
which only he had access 
the currency was allegedly money that west germany paid for the 
release of east german political prisoners adn said 
also on sunday west germanys der spiegel magazine reported 
honecker claimed he was personally responsible for preventing a 
bloody crackdown on demonstrators in the early stages of east 
germanys peaceful revolution 
honecker said in a letter to prosecutors that he ordered police 
and soldiers in the city of leipzig not to fire during a 
demonstration oct 9 according to der spiegel 
der spiegel distributed its report to western news agencies in 
advance of its arrival on newsstands monday

eduardo guerrero rose just before 
midnight saddled and mounted his dappled gray horse and rode four 
hours through the dark hills before dawn sunday to vote for the 
first time in his life 
the 24yearold peasantrancher stood in line with about 2000 
other campesinos anxious to have their say about 10 years of 
revolutionary leftist sandinista government 
jose mejia president of the polling station said he expected 
well over 90 percent of the 2300 voters registered in los chinamos 
to cast ballots 
the hamlet of thatchroofed bamboosided houses along a rocky 
road lined with banana trees is in the heart of the opposition 
stronghold of chontales province 
nearly all the men wore straw cowboy hats jeans and texasstyle 
boots many with spurs more than 100 horses were tethered along a 
fence behind the wooden tinroofed polling station resembling an 
ample shed 
all of those consulted were adamantly antisandinista several 
said the incumbents would be lucky to get a few votes in los 
chinamos perhaps from some but not all of the score of unarmed 
soldiers in camouflage uniforms interspersed in groups of four or 
five among the peasants 
pregnant women those with infants in tow and the elderly and 
infirm were given priority when the polling station opened at 7 am 
guerrero had arrived just after 4 am when there were already 
about 200 people lined up to vote 
its well worth it to lose a day we dont like the 
sandinistas much around here he said 
many of those interviewed expressed open admiration and support 
for the ussupported contra rebels camped in the hills around los 
chinamos and throughout northern chontales 
the rebels had clashed saturday with sandinista soldiers 
stationed down the road a sandinista officer said one soldier was 
killed and another wounded 
he said security for the voting was increased after intelligence 
reports showed the contras planned to put in an appearance in 
chinamos during the voting 
judging from the comments of those standing in line the 
counterrevolutionaries most likely would have been cheered 
when the sandinistas won the war against somoza just about 
everyone in nicaragua was sandinista said jose alvarez perez 
26 but weve been negatively affected by them 
the men complained bitterly of what they said was harsh 
repression of relatives and neighbors suspected of collaboration 
with the rebels 
prospero alvarez said he was jailed three times in recent years 
for a total of four months they put us in jail for nothing he 
said 
it was unclear if his open sympathy for the rebels predated his 
incarceration or was a byproduct of it 
humberto salazar 52 said his son antonio was killed by 
sandinista forces last year as he returned home from a corn patch 
they just opened fire didnt even yell out to him he said 
we dont believe in the promises of daniel ortega alvarez 
said of the regimes campaign vow that everything will be 
better 
the government contends that once its reelection is certified 
as free and fair washington will have no choice but to end support 
for the contras ortega says a definite end to the war will result 
in progress towards prosperity 
but those around los chinamos doubt the war will end as long as 
the sandinistas remain in power 
the contra is fighting against a system that does not allow 
him to live said another peasant rancher who asked not to be 
identified as long as the sandinista regime continues the war 
continues when they leave the war will end 
those of us who have suffered the war personally do not 
believe it will end said a 32yearold woman who also declined 
to provide her name 
my husband has been fighting for the contras for six years 
the sandinistas had taken him away once and he wasnt going to wait 
for them to take him again im left with seven children to take 
care of she added

former san antonio mayor henry cisneros has 
endorsed democratic gubernatorial candidate ann richards despite 
allegations that she used the term wetbacks in a 1976 campaign 
speech 
cisneros said he had been unaware of the controversy until 
saturday when he went ahead with scheduled endorsement anyway 
the hispanicoriented newspaper tiempo ran an article feb 22 
alleging that ms richards referred to illegal aliens as 
wetbacks while running for travis county commissioner 
she responded by accusing jim mattox a rival for the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination of planting the story as part of a smear 
campaign the mattox campaign said ms richards is just trying to 
shift the blame 
but cisneros praised ms richards for her longtime support of 
hispanics and called the allegation of a racial slur the last 
gasps of a campaign that has nothing else to talk about 
not anyone who is a serious student of anns record can take 
it seriously said cisneros one of the countrys best known 
hispanics in politics it just isnt in character and i think 
its inconsequential in the final analysis 
ernesto fraga publisher of wacobased tiempo produced 
handwritten copies of a speech ms richards made to a labor group 
during her successful 1976 campaign for county commissioner he 
said the mattox campaign had nothing to do with the article 
a sentence in the speech text fraga quoted said if it takes a 
man to hire nonunion labor cross picket lines and work wetbacks 
then i say thank god for a woman or anyone else who is willing to 
take over 
ms richards originally said the part of the speech that uses 
the term wasnt in her handwriting she later said she may have 
written wetbacks but maintained she didnt say it 
ms richards stressed the minority hiring and promotion record 
of the state treasury which she heads saying it is the best of 
any state agency she also promised that hispanics would play a key 
role in her administration if she were elected

to hear some people tell it there 
is money to burn in this trendy seaside community but it still 
isnt every day that a bank tosses 42500 into the trash 
were sort of embarrassed great american bank spokesman 
brian luscomb said friday a day after the windfall was recovered 
from a municipal trash truck that had hauled it away 
it was an accident and were really not commenting much beyond 
that said luscomb who added that a bank employee whose name 
wasnt released put the money in the wrong container 
when the garbage truck got to the dump officials there had been 
warned about the missing cash and they had the driver take his 
load to a city yard instead the garbage was dumped there and 
municipal employees dug through the trash until they found the cash 
the citys trash collectors must try to track down the owners of 
expensive items but can keep lesser ones said general services

just call amtrak no 581 the little train 
that could if you gave it long enough 
a san diegolos angeles commuter run that normally takes two 
hours and 45 minutes took more than twice that friday the first 
locomotive broke down the second was sluggish the crew walked off 
the job and the replacement crew members couldnt get their van to 
start 
it seems that everything that could have gone wrong did 
said renee banks an amtrak spokeswoman in washington this 
certainly is an unfortunate incident it really doesnt happen that 
often 
first the locomotives air compressor failed stalling the 
trains engines and leaving the roughly 500 passengers without air 
conditioning on a day when temperatures reached the high 70s 
the train sat on the tracks south of oceanside for almost 90 
minutes until an engine borrowed from santa fe railway was hitched 
to the cars but the replacement engine designed to haul freight 
trains was far slower and progress was painstaking 
then with the train just 11 miles from its destination the 
amtrak crew stopped work and with it the train citing a federal 
law that doesnt allow railway crews to work past the end of their 
shifts 
the train sat for yet another hour as a replacement crew 
struggled with a van that wouldnt start the crew members finally 
borrowed an amtrak superintendents car and drove to the train 
eventually no 581 did arrive in los angeles about six hours 
after it left san diego enough time to make a roundtrip journey 
between the two cities

rival christian forces battled with 
mortars and machine guns in east beirut sunday blocking efforts to 
reopen a key road junction linking their districts 
a police spokesman said the threehour battle began when a 
mediation committee tried to remove mines and barricades blocking a 
traffic circle linking a district controlled by samir geageas 
lebanese forces militia with territory dominated by gen michel 
aouns troops 
the intersection links the militiacontrolled pockets of nabaa 
and ashrafiyeh with the armyheld neighborhood of sin elfil and 
horsh tabet 
the police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said the clash intensified into an exchange of mortar 
rounds between the warring factions across the whole of east beirut 
geageas militia blamed the escalation on aouns troops saying 
they opened fire at soldiers preparing to remove mines from the 
sand barricades 
aoun wants to block efforts aimed at stabilizing the 
ceasefire a communique said 
aouns command countered that the militiamen were cheating the 
population by claiming they want to reopen roads 
police said the exchange started several fires in the 
miltiaheld district of ashrafiyeh and the armycontrolled district 
of furn elshubbak before the fighting subsided into an 
intermittent exchange of sniper fire at dusk 
the rival forces also clashed across roads reopened earlier in 
the day for the first time in three weeks the police spokesman 
said two mortar rounds crashed into a moslem district of west 
beirut early in the evening but no casualties were reported 
the two sides fought despite separate efforts by a christian 
mediation committee and a palestinian delegation to end the 
bloodletting 
despite a ceasefire that went into effect on feb 17 there was 
little sign of an end to the 26day battle for control of the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
geageas headquarters reported one of their fighters was killed 
by sniper fire and aouns command said two soldiers were wounded 
by police count at least 691 people have been killed and 1915 
wounded in the fighting that began jan 30 the worst between 
christian rivals since the civil war between moslems and christians 
broke out in april 1975 
parts of the city have been left in ruins and aouns troops have 
corralled thousands of geageas militiamen in several districts of 
east beirut in the power struggle 
the roads crossing the confrontation lines were reopened after 
several days of negotiating between the rival forces by a mediation 
committee of three independent christian leaders 
some of the roads had been mined and others remain so posing 
dangers to civilians fleeing to safer areas or trying to repair 
their shattered homes 
a committee statement said the mediators will continue their 
efforts until all roads are reopened and the combatants 
disengaged 
geagea whose forces control the christian sectors ports and 
twothirds of the enclave has indicated he is prepared to 
negotiate 
but aoun who started the fighting by moving against geagea 
showed no sign of seeking a negotiated settlement 
im convinced that the committee will not be able to achieve 
any result because geageas declared stands contradict his 
statements he was quoted as saying by the londonbased alhayat 
newspaper 
geagea has rejected aouns demand that the militias 6000 
hardcore fighters who have been backed by thousands of reservists 
be disbanded and absorbed into his 19000strong army and the 
lebanese forces transformed into a purely political organization 
the christian warlord instead proposes a joint command for his 
militia and aouns troops 
president elias hrawi elected by parliament in november with a 
mandate to carry out a lebanese peace plan has dismissed aoun as 
military commander however aoun does not recognize hrawis 
authority 
aoun also opposes a syrianbacked peace plan saying it should 
call for a complete withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
the 40000 syrian soldiers came under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate but aoun says they are really acting as a 
moslem ally in the countrys civil war

the electoral process in the main is going normally although

all three areas are known for heavy contra rebel activity and 
all are strongholds of opposition to the leftist sandinista 
government 
the most serious incident took place saturday night near the 
town of la cruz del rio grande about 65 miles north of the 
atlantic coast town of bluefields when two sandinista party 
activists were kidnapped authorities said 
when we heard about the kidnappings we got together and 
decided the safest thing to do would be to close the precinct 
said dr cirilo omier president of the regional vote collection 
center in bluefields in a telephone interview 
he said representatives of the sandinista party and the united 
national opposition coalition agreed to the closures as did the 
indian organization yatama which supports unos presidential

term said saturday night that contra activity had been reported 
north of santa rosa in the province of leon

eightyearold erik hundley of south nyack 
ny rattles off the civil rights struggles of martin luther king 
jr after a week of study but admits i forgot who harriet tubman 
was 
sameena parveen 13 an eighth grader at kettering middle school 
in largo md is intrigued with the underground railroad movement 
and the role of a virtual unknown john henry who mapped the 
secret routes 
and 12yearold lakeisha lewis of spencer okla becomes 
sort of angry when she thinks about how the civil rights 
thing came about because i dont think people should be treated 
like that 
the study of black american heroes and heroines went into high 
gear in schools this month as it does every february in 
recognition of black history month although started in 1926 by 
carter g woodson in recognition of the birthdays of abraham 
lincoln and frederick douglass celebration of the special month 
gained momentum when kings birthday became a national holiday 
now kings january birthday is used as the springboard into 
februarys recognition of other black leaders during special school 
assemblies field trips classroom projects book reports skits 
and plays 
its good theres a month to remember the accomplishments of 
the blacks said sameena a native of india some students 
dont seem to care and some people do change their attitudes 
toward other races i think most of the students only act like 
they really care and then quickly forget 
bernadine lyles of the los angeles unified school district the 
nations second largest after new york said many of the 646 
schools start with the king holiday to go into their program on 
black americans 
that holiday has created much more awareness said ms 
lyles instructional adviser of the elementary level for the 
multicultural unit of the office of instruction most students 
have some idea of the civil rights movement and its effect on 
african american history and culture 
san francisco schools spokeswoman madelaine eaton said all 
64000 students participate in a martin luther king essay contest 
as part of black history month the district which is 20 percent 
black also offers students and teachers an array of black american 
art and language resources but each school is left to develop its 
own particular programs 
in some other states the teaching of black history is 
determined mainly by the size of the black student body and by the 
interests of the teachers 
at community high school in carbondale ill english teacher 
anna jackson said there are no special assemblies for either kings 
birthday or black history month 
i really try to integrate black history throughout the year 
by incorporating the works of blacks and other minorities in the 
classroom assignments said ms jackson one of six minority 
teachers about 30 percent of the 1000 students at the school are 
black or asian 
to her dismay though the school usually gives semester exams 
during the days leading up to kings birthday so the kids are 
focusing on preparing for the exam 
at the private allgirl la reine high school in the washington 
dc suburb of suitland md sister kateri said it is a 
frustrating struggle to keep up with the changing needs of the 475 
young women the student body was 12 percent black in 1973 and is 
now 63 percent black three of the 42 faculty members are black 
i would say that the study of black history has come slowly 
but we have tried to integrate it as much as possible said 
sister kateri i think it all depends how strong a teacher might 
be inclined toward spending the individual time although there has 
been a definite push for this 
for others the king holiday underscores the need to include 
other cultures in school curriculum and textbooks 
clayborne carson a former civil rights activist who is editor 
of kings papers a 15year project that is expected to result in 
publication of 12 volumes of kings writings and speeches said 
that in many schools the black history focus is merely token 
its like we created the occasion before we knew what we were 
going to do with it said carson who is at american university 
this semester as a visiting landmarks scholar in american history 
its going to be a long process moving from tokenism to 
meaningful content weve just begun that process 
nannette mcgee consultant for social studies education in the 
georgia department of education said that although textbooks have 
been written about blacks in america it just seems that they 
became old and out of date and they were not used because of that 
social studies textbooks have not been updated in five years 
she said 
murdell mcfarlin of the atlanta public schools agreed 
school officials arent replacing the books right now because 
its not the statescheduled time but they are supplementing them 
with essays and other information said mrs mcfarlin 
iowa in 1976 became the first state to pass a law mandating that 
school curriculum incorporate contributions of minorities and women 
in new york state education commissioner thomas sobol recently 
announced plans to draft broad revisions in the states public 
school curriculum to give greater recognition to the contributions 
of nonwhite cultures to american society the changes would affect 
the states 25 million public schoolchildren 
ellen swartz multicultural project coordinator in the 
rochester ny school district said the district has been 
working for three years designing and producing classroom materials 
about groups that are usually misrepresented or omitted in 
textbooks and other educational materials while most of the 
material developed is used voluntarily by the teachers she said 
officials now are working on a ninth grade textbook on africans 
rochester has taken a step past many districts that ive seen 
not in intent but in actions said ms swartz what we are 
doing thats different is committing the resources and dollars we 
are solidly on the cutting edge of movement in this area 
jack gaffney social studies program coordinator for the san 
diego unified school district said the district tries to 
incorporate a strong multicultural strand into the curriculum 
all the way down through kindergarten 
its a matter of infusing things where they would normally 
occur in history in the curriculum to increase the depths of 
cultural studies said gaffney 
marlowe teig who for 22 years worked with a number of textbook 
publishers said many schools are unable to puchase uptodate 
textbooks that reflect black history school and community 
officials also are not clear about what they want in the textbooks 
and fail to list the criteria he added 
developing textbooks that reflect the role of blacks and others 
in american society is more than just mentioning all the 
leaders or taking a paragraph out and plugging another one 
in he said 
you have to be more reflective textbooks are not like usa 
today they dont line the garbage cans tomorrow they are going to 
be around for years they affect childrens lives

gov jim martin has decided against seeking 
any elective office once his term ends in 1992 saying he wanted to 
preclude criticism that he was positioning himself for future 
campaigns 
in a letter to the news amp observer published sunday martin said 
he was embittered by what he viewed as unfair partisan attacks by 
democrats 
convinced that i can more effectively lead and work for a 
stronger north carolina if my motives cannot be misrepresented i 
am happy to sacrifice any further martin candidacy he said 
the republican governor also vigorously challenged news reports 
that criticized his performance at a thursday news conference in 
which he defended his research office against allegations that it 
engaged in taxfunded campaign activities 
during that appearance he at times appeared incoherent 
uncharacteristically used profanity and disregarded the entreaties 
of aides who wanted him to stop talking 
his staff attributed martins performance in part to medication 
he had taken for a throat infection but in his letter to the 
newspaper martin said he had not taken medication before the news 
conference but that he was in agony from the illness 
the governor said saturday that although he was fighting the 
effects of a severe throat and sinus infection he was in control 
he said he would hold the news conference again under the same 
circumstances 
martin called the appearance the best day of his political 
career 
it was my best because i stood up on wobbly legs and 
suppressed my illness long enough to identify the democrat 
investigators and newspaper who tried to destroy me before i ran 
again he said 
martin lashed out at what he said was unfair treatment by 
attorney general lacy thornburg and to a lesser extent by state 
auditor ed renfrow both democrats 
he said he was angry over reports that thornburg was considering 
whether to investigate the governors research office for possible 
political misuse of state property thornburg said friday that his 
office would not investigate 
martin said it appeared that he was rambling during the news 
conference because he had been handed a note by an aide saying 
thornburg had accepted his invitation for a confrontation at the 
news conference and was on his way 
he said he didnt want to leave before thornburg got there and 
be accused of a cowardly retreat 
as weak as i was i was going to stand my ground with him 
martin said i had come to despise him i was going to make him 
put the handcuffs on me right there in front of the reporters if 
thats what he wanted to do 
but john simmons a spokesman for thornburg said sunday that 
the attorney general never sent word that he would attend the news 
conference 
martin said he had decided against challenging us sen terry 
sanford some time ago because he and his wife dorothy had no 
desire to return to washington where he served 12 years in the 
house of representatives 
but he had planned to defer the announcement until after the 
1990 elections to keep from becoming a lame duck and losing some of 
his political influence 
by renouncing future political ambitions martin said he could 
work to solve the states problems without having every move 
interpreted in the light of a possible senate bid 
after the way you piled on when i was down he wrote in the 
letter to claude sitton editor of the news amp observer i know 
for certain that the only worthwhile ambition left for me is to 
root you and lacy thornburg out of north carolina politics along 
with any democrats who take delight in your mischief

when loretta borns purse was stolen she 
lost more than money and id cards she lost a little magnet thats 
an important part of an experimental paincontrol device 
born was forced to improvise saturday night when her purse 
suddenly was missing after a stranger came to the door ostensibly 
to ask for directions but with the help of a neighbors magnet and 
telephoned instructions from her doctor born was able to control 
the device implanted within her body 
a nerve stimulator and the generator that powers it were 
surgically implanted in born as part of an experimental treatment 
for pain that resulted from spinal injuries that she suffered in a 
car accident 
borns doctor robert weiner said fewer than 40 people in the 
country are using the device 
born said she would touch the magnet to the skin of her abdomen 
in order to turn off the power to the generator under her skin if 
the stimulator runs too long she said its painful and it 
causes my legs to jerk and makes it impossible for me to lie down 
when the purse and magnet disappeared born contacted sheriffs 
deputy philip escude who called local hospitals and then contacted 
weiner in dallas 
he told us that she would have to be brought back to dallas 
unless somebody could find a magnet to turn her off escude said 
born said her husband borrowed a magnet from a neighbor 
the magnet was larger and more powerful than the one she usually 
uses so weiner told me not to put it against my skin first we 
started out about six inches away then four then two inches it 
finally cut off when we put the magnet about two inches away 
without the stimulator working right born said she is in pain 
she said she was scared she might damage the equipment if she used 
the neighbors magnet again but she would have to wait until 
monday to get another magnet from her doctor or hope the young 
woman who stole her purse returns her own magnet

for a while it seemed like the old soviet union 
of the days before mikhail gorbachev and glasnost 
we heard about tanks about police waiting with gas and 
shovels said one fearful middleaged woman at a prodemocracy 
protest in the capital during nationwide demonstrations sunday 
carrying a sign saying we dont need a palace coup we need 
direct elections the woman was one of tens of thousands who 
marched past sandfilled dump trucks barricading all approaches to 
the kremlin about 17000 police lay in wait with truncheons and 
water cannon 
protesters were clearly intimidated by authorities warnings of 
the possibility of violence promises of harsh penalties for 
extremists and reports that hospitals were prepared for many 
casualties 
it didnt happen 
the rally at the north end of the garden ring road in moscow 
started small and tentatively with sidelong glances at rows of 
giant snowplows blocking exits from the parade route 
however one leader repeatedly promised police through a 
bullhorn we represent no danger other protesters struck up 
conversations with individual officers to defuse tension 
gradually it became clear that the army of police and interior 
ministry troops were not preparing to charge the protesters 
throngs of muscovites joined the protest which eventually 
included about 100000 people red blue and white flags of tsarist 
russia fluttered in the occasional drizzle along with red and black 
flags of anarchists and the skyblue cross on a white background of 
the memorial society which is dedicated to remembering the victims 
of dictator josef stalin 
even the knots of police finally relaxed stashing their riot 
gear 
general are you with the people shouted a woman in the 
crowd to a stocky interior ministry officer directing crowd control 
at gorky park one of the gathering points for the march 
sure i am replied maj gen georgy postoyuk contrary to 
widespread rumors that authorities planned to provoke violence to 
justify a crackdown he said officials worked closely with rally 
organizers and the result was a very good orderly meeting 
the crowd count was much lower than organizers had predicted 
before the barrage of warnings they included a television appeal 
by minister of culture nikolai gubenko a popular actor for 
cancellation of the demonstrations 
several planned counterdemonstrations of conservative and 
nationalist groups elsewhere in the city never materialized 
authorities even went so far as to broadcast a polish film 
called the sex mission with nudity rare on soviet television 
on sunday morning protesting student ivan chemburov said he 
thought it was a deliberate attempt to entice people to stay home 
from the demonstration 
rally banners demanded multiparty elections and land for anyone 
who wants to work it some speakers drew loud applause as they 
called for the resignation of the entire council of ministers and 
the communist party politburo 
communism is a cancerous tumor said one poster party 
mafia resign weve had enough of marxistleninism we want to 
live like people read another 
protester valentina burakov said her father was killed in the 
stalinist repression of the 1930s and she came to the meeting so 
this would never happen again 
parliamentarian yuri afanasiev called for transformation of the 
soviet union into a union of independent states he warned that 
president gorbachevs call for a strong presidency could restore 
totalitarianism

mounting financial losses caused in 
part by the cost of treating indigent gangviolence victims from 
neighboring los angeles prompted the planned closing of a hospital 
trauma center officials said 
huntington memorial hospital announced friday it will close its 
emergencycare center at the end of april the hospital which lost 
37 million last year rejected los angeles countys offer of 16 
million to offset losses if they would keep the trauma center open 
it took a lot of careful soulsearching and debate to do this 
but we simply could no longer afford to absorb the loss said 
allen w mathies jr the hospitals president and chief executive 
officer we believe the trauma network is an important concept 
but we can no longer sustain such a loss 
its closing leaves just 12 such centers in the countys trauma 
center network down from 23 when the system opened in 1983 
it is yet another instance in a national trend thats seeing the 
shutdown of more city hospitals offering special care for trauma 
the medical name given to lifethreatening injuries in miami 
chicago philadelphia and elsewhere private hospitals have been 
shutting down trauma units most of which opened in the mid1980s 
the specialtys boom years 
several emergencycare officials said huntingtons decision to 
close was prompted by complaints by hospital physicians about the 
lack of reimbursement for treating poor patients 
some doctors said they were tired of treating shooting victims 
from gangplagued southcentral los angeles nearly 20 miles south 
of pasadena and other areas far away from the city of largely 
middle and upperclass neighborhoods 
you cant help but be unhappy that when you have a patient due 
for surgery and you have to postpone it to deal with a gunshot 
victim from southcentral said dr david faddis a surgeon at 
huntington nobody was happy with the situation but im sure 
most of the surgeons would agree that if they could have kept the 
trauma center open they would have

riot police dragged away 
prodemocracy protesters to break up an unauthorized rally sunday 
but they allowed a sanctioned protest demanding that soviet rulers 
give up their grip on power 
about 8000 people ignored rumors of impending violence and took 
part in the second rally which officials authorized as part of 
nationwide protests demanding radical political and economic 
reforms 
in february 1917 we started on the road to democracy in 
october we got dictatorship now there is a similar situation 
ilya konstantinov a candidate for the march 4 russian 
parliamentary elections told the crowd outside the lenin 
sportsconcert complex 
leningrad the site of three uprisings while it was capital of 
the russian empire has been dubbed the cradle of revolution 
in 1905 czarist forces fired on demonstrators demanding democratic 
reforms in a clash known as bloody sunday 
sunday was the anniversary of another uprising the 1917 
february russian revolution in which bourgeoisdemocratic forces 
seized power and forced czar nicholas ii to abdicate 
the bolshevik communists led by vladimir i lenin took over 
eight months later 
leningrad the countrys secondlargest city with 5 million 
residents has been a political hotspot ever since and on sunday 
was in the spotlight again 
an hour before the rally at the sports complex about a dozen 
activists in the democratic union a radical group fighting to end 
the communist partys grip on power gathered on a square outside 
the young spectators theater 
as a column of 100 police surrounded the crowd and kgb 
plainclothes agents stood by an officer approached and shouted 
through a megaphone that no demonstration was authorized 
a dozen riot police wearing white helmets and green bulletproof 
vests then stormed in and dragged away several of the activists 
who had no protest posters and had not made any public statements 
the activists some carried by the police were loaded onto 
buses for detention a parliamentary candidate and associated press 
photographer dominique mollard also were taken away but later 
released after their identification documents were checked 
one activist climbed atop a yellow construction crane and 
unfurled a cloth banner that referred to the march 4 elections 
boycott its your first step to freedom it read 
he threw to the crowd below slips of paper that carried the same 
slogan along with participation in elections allows a 
continuation of the 72year experiment on russia 
it was signed democratic union 
five riot police quickly mounted the crane and dragged down the 
protester 
posters at the sports complex later also urged a boycott of the 
elections and one used a 1917 quote from lenin to attack the 
current leadership at the top is shame and disorder the party 
in power protects its scoundrels read a red banner with white 
letters hanging on the marble speakers platform 
writer mikhail chulaky a member of the grassroots group 
peoples front told the crowd huddling on a wet parking lot under 
a gray rainy sky that the communist partys decision earlier this 
month to end its monopoly on power was long overdue and added 
the party of genocide must be disbanded like germanys nazi 
party was disbanded by nuremberg 
several speakers attacked president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposal to strengthen his powers as president again they are 
wrapping a dictator around our necks said nikolai ivanov a 
soviet parliamentarian from leningrad whose crusade against 
official corruption has made him immensely popular 
a protest banner equated the presidency with fascism a powerful 
comparison in a city where 600000 people were killed by the nazis 
in world war ii 
a resolution passed by a show of demonstrators hands and a 
resounding da said the president should be chosen by the 
people not the party apparatus and urged voters on march 4 to 
elect prodemocracy candidates and tear power from the 
apparatus 
leaders of the peoples front leningrads biggest prodemocracy 
group decided to boycott the rally because they feared retaliation 
from either the government or rightwing groups dissenting 
peoples front members showed up and harshly condemned their 
leaders decision 
police and plainclothes kgb agents stood by and did not 
interfere in the rally and there were no incidents

more than 150000 people chanting 
enough of the nightmare rallied sunday in the largest 
challenge to the communist regime since hardline leader todor 
zhivkov was ousted in november 
participants at the rally in sofia the capital also chanted 
down with the communist party and called for democracy 
the crowd whose size was estimated by western reporters 
gathered despite a communist attempt to defuse popular discontent 
by agreeing to concessions sought by opposition parties 
the partys supreme council on friday announced it will ban 
communist cells in places of work postpone general elections from 
may to june giving the opposition more time to prepare and invite 
foreign observers to monitor the voting 
meantime the communist party is in sole control of government 
despite reforms it has resisted compromise with opposition forces 
more than communists in other eastern european countries 
the protesters who gathered in unseasonably balmy weather in 
the square in front of party headquarters cheered as opposition 
leader petko simeonov declared the winter of our discontent is 
at an end the spring of our struggle has begun 
on friday the supreme council suggested upgrading suspended 
talks with the opposition to a permanently functioning general 
political forum to prepare for a transition to democracy but

the roman catholic church sunday freed more than 150 prodemocracy 
student protesters who were beaten and detained after a 10hour 
occupation of abidjan cathedral 
we are happy that we secured their release abbot athenase 
ake said as freed students fell to their knees before him kissing 
his hand in thanks 
but state television said president felix houphouetboigny 
pardoned the students out of his love of the countrys youth 
in the first official comment on weeklong student protests that 
have led to violent clashes with police internal security minister 
youssouf koffi said demonstrators are being manipulated by 
selfserving bandits with ulterior motives 
he claimed 70 protesters detained during the unrest were not 
university students 
the disorder will stop he said 
the students freed sunday raised clenched fists and sang the 
national anthem greetings land of promise in front of the 
police station 
they said they would continue monday with prodemocracy 
protests which pose the most serious challenge in years to the 
conservative government of houphouetboigny 
the university students say they are angered by the gulf between 
rich and poor in this west african nation they say government 
officials live lavishly while ordinary citizens suffer 
the students are demanding that houphouetboigny step down and 
make way for a multiparty democracy he has ruled the ivory coast 
as a oneparty state since its independence from france in 1960 
ake told reporters that roman catholic officials felt 
responsible for the detention of the students because they left the 
cathedral saturday after clergymen there were assured the students 
would be allowed to go free the students were beaten and detained 
when they left the cathedral 
the dispute threatens normally close relations between the 
church and the embattled government of houphouetboigny an ardent 
catholic

representatives of businesses trade unions and professional 
organizations

the economic crisis caused by slumping cocoa and coffee prices the 
cornerstones of ivory coasts oncethriving economy 
one delegate said the president is expected to announce more of 
the austerity measures that have angered students but the 
delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity said the president 
also may meet one student demand by announcing salary cuts for 
cabinet ministers 
employees at stateowned companies had their salaries cut 30 
percent this month and the students want the ministers pay 
reduced by that amount 
other civil servants have had their salary levels frozen for 
eight years

from siberia to the southern republic of georgia 
hundreds of thousands of soviets rallied for democracy in more than 
30 cities sunday despite official warnings that the soviet unions 
first nationwide protest could explode in violence 
more than 100000 people turned out in moscow and smaller 
protests occurred elsewhere the official warnings which were 
repeated frequently last week in the staterun media kept the 
turnout low in some cities and prevented some protests altogether 
riot police dragged away people who tried to hold an 
unsanctioned demonstration in leningrad but there were no reports 
of major unrest 
in moscow the crowd grew through the afternoon as initial 
tension gave way to a relaxed and goodnatured atmosphere one 
column of marchers was led by a man with a bullhorn who told police 
and bystanders we represent no danger 
gavril popov a member of the congress of peoples deputies and 
one of the organizers of the demonstration day told masses 
gathered under cloudy skies that the communist party and state 
apparatus had engineered a campaign of fear not seen since stalin 
in an attempt to thwart the outpouring of popular sentiment 
the protests were planned after a successful feb 4 
prodemocracy rally in moscow in which about 200000 people 
demanded the communist party give up its monopoly on power the 
party did so shortly afterward 
thousands of uniformed police and internal security troops 
guarded the authorized march route along the broad garden ring road 
that circles the city center sandfilled dump trucks water trucks 
and snowplows sealed off all roads leading from the garden ring 
road into the downtown area where the kremlin and red square were 
guarded by more police posted about every 30 feet 
estimates of the number of protesters varied widely from 
200000 reported by the official press agency novosti which had a 
view of the rally site in moscow to a halfmillion claimed by 
popov 
an independent newsletter issued by radio moscow quoted unnamed 
interior ministry officials as putting the crowd at 300000 
maj gen georgy postoyuk of the interior ministry who said he 
was in charge of security at gorky park estimated 100000 people 
gathered at the park they then marched across a bridge over the 
moscow river and met up with a considerably smaller group that had 
gathered at the foreign ministry together they headed to the 
rally site 
reports from police local activists interviewed by telephone 
and staterun media indicated as many as 276000 people took part 
in protest rallies in 32 cities outside moscow from 
petropavlovskkamchatky in the soviet far east to leningrad on the 
baltic sea coast 
all was against us popov told the crowd in moscows 
zubovsky square 
the city council was late in announcing the site time 
routes television has special entertainment shows on the 
authorities have waged a campaign of stepping up tensions 
hysteria rumors provocations and libel unheard of since 1937 
when stalins campaign of terror reached its height popov said 
with banners placards and flags the demonstrators demanded 
democratic reforms ranging from direct popular election of the 
president to a multiparty system 
speakers urged them to endorse progressive candidates running in 
march 4 parliamentary elections in the russian federation and 
demanded the ouster of members of the ruling politburo and council 
of ministers as well as kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov 
with a massive show of hands the crowd voted in support of a 
platform presented by historian and parliament deputy yuri 
afanasyev that proposed a direct presidential election 
estabishment of private property and the turning over staterun 
media from party control to editorial collectives 
were fed up with how we live said one demonstrator 
celestine langovaya a music teacher in her 50s when mikhail 
s gorbachev first came to power i believed in him but things 
have gotten worse for millions of people 
security forces were much in evidence but more battalions were 
held in reserve on side streets and just out of sight behind 
buildings and in walled construction sites 
a special information center of the novosti press agency said 
100000 people gathered on lenin square in minsk the byelorussian 
capital for the largest turnout reported outside the soviet 
capital 
only about 8000 demonstrators showed up at the officially 
authorized rally site in leningrad the nations secondlargest 
city leaders of the proindependence peoples front movement there 
had urged followers to boycott the event because authorities would 
not grant permission to demonstrate in a downtown street 
riot police far outnumbered a small group that did try to 
demonstrate downtown without official permission officers broke up 
the attempted protest and dragged demonstrators aboard waiting 
buses 
in riga latvias capital no rallies were held for fears of 
provoking reprisals by troops said uldis smit of the latvian 
peoples front 
authorities in the southern russian city of rostovondon 
refused to allow any rallies and about 100 dismayed activists 
gathered near the local communist party headquarters to hand out 
leaflets the official tass news agency said 
military authorities in azerbaijan banned all demonstrations 
fearing a renewal of the nationalist violence that led to ethnic 
warfare between armenians and azerbaijanis in january 
about 2000 were said to have gathered in the central siberian 
city of krasnoyarsk but activists there said many people went to 
the wrong places because statecontrolled media had refused to 
report plans for the rally 
elsewhere local activists said 50000 people rallied in 
georgias capital of tbilisi and 12000 in the large siberian city 
of novosibirsk another 18000 people attended two rallies in the 
urals city of sverdlovsk they said 
in tbilisi the demonstrators tore down street signs of a street 
named after lenin and renamed it for a prominent georgian dissident 
killed in a car crash last year a political activist said 
in kiev 50000 ukrainians gathered said victor linchevsky a 
spokesman for the grassroots organization rukh an angry crowd 
later prevented police from detaining three activists he said

a us doctor arrived in new 
zealand monday to try to reclaim his 7yearold daughter who is at 
the center of a bitter custody battle and reportedly has not seen 
either of her parents for two years 
the girls mother dr jean elizabeth morgan was jailed for 25 
months in august 1987 when she refused to say where her daughter 
was after a us court gave her former husband unsupervised access 
to the child 
morgan a 42yearold plastic surgeon in washington had claimed 
her exhusband dr eric foretich sexually abused the child a 
charge he denies 
morgan sent the girl hilary foretich away with her maternal 
grandparents first to england then to christchurch to prevent 
her father from seeing her 
but foretich announced saturday he had located the girl in 
christchurch where she has been living for nearly two years 
morgan reportedly accused him of hunting hilary down like an 
animal 
foretich flew from washington dc into mangere international 
airport on the north island and was to fly to christchurch in the 
south for a family court hearing according to the new zealand 
press association 
certainly were going to do what we need to do to rescue my 
daughter the press association quoted him as saying 
morgan is unable to travel to new zealand because her passport 
was taken from her when she went to jail she was released in 
september 
hilary was allowed to speak to her mother by telephone sunday 
for the first time in two years her family said 
when she talked to her mother she broke down in tears said 
her maternal grandmother antonia morgan weve got letters to us 
through various channels but this was the first time she had 
spoken on the phone to her 
before he boarded the flight foretich of falls church va 
reportedly accused his former wife of waging a media campaign 
against him 
i think elizabeth morgan and the people who follow her are 
very misguided people by the way theyre going to make it difficult 
for my daughter and its really a shame said foretich a 
45yearold dental surgeon 
my daughter deserves to come back and have a normal life 
radio new zealand quoted foretich as saying 
the mother flung back her own charges claiming her former 
husband sought publicity himself according to the new zealand 
press association 
eric is the one who has had a publicity agent for i think six 
months to a year not me 
he has hunted her down like an animal she does not want to 
see him and he knows that the agency said quoting her from the 
united states 
william morgan the childs maternal grandfather told 
television new zealand he would call the police if foretich tried 
to approach hilary 
he cant do it i would have to call the police because the 
court order says he cant he said 
the family court in christchurch granted an interim order on 
friday giving the maternal grandparents custody of hilary 
police in new zealand said attorneys for foretich lost a bid for 
interim custody of hilary in the christchurch family court on 
friday 
the mothers lawyer predicted this latest stage in the battle 
would be drawn out 
certainly there will be several weeks of preparation and 
perhaps two or three months before we have a hearing before the 
family court in christchurch said lyn stevens the court refused 
to comment on the case or say when a hearing would be held 
foretich will have to start from scratch in the family court 
custody battle for hilary despite the us order giving him 
visitation rights said geoff ellis a family court lawyer not 
involved in the case 
the guardianship law in new zealand is childcentered rather 
than parentally he said monday 
hilarys mother is also believed to be trying to fly to 
christchurch but she must first go to court to win the return of 
her passport 
a swarm of american journalists was expected to arrive in new 
zealand to cover the case which is one of the bestknown custody 
battles in the united states 
the couple wed in january 1982 but separated seven months later 
a week before hilary was born they obtained a divorce that 
november on the carribean island of haiti where the marriage took 
place 
bitter wrangling over foretichs rights to visit the child 
started in 1985 when she was 2years old accusing him of sexual 
abuse morgan sought a court order to suspend the visits between 
father and daughter 
in november of that year judge herbert dixon in the washington 
superior court found there was inconclusive evidence of abuse 
morgan was also unsuccessful in a federal court jury trial in 
mid1986 which she initiated through a civil lawsuit against her 
former husband

some of the indelible ink being used 
to mark voters fingers as a safeguard against multiple voting is 
not so indelible the head of the supreme electoral council 
admitted sunday 
but the official mariano fiallos said there were other 
safeguards against a citizen voting more than once and there was no 
evidence of abuse 
in a live tv interview fiallos said some of the special ink 
could be taken off with common laundry bleach the ink was supposed 
to stain for three days 
fiallos did not specify to how many of the 4394 polling places 
nationwide the faulty ink had been distributed saying only that 
some of the inkpots were at fault 
opposition vice presidential candidate virgilio godoy held up a 
clean thumb at a news conference and said hed been able to wash 
his finger after voting 
he said the opposition had received scattered reports from 
managua and the provincial capital of matagalpa on the problem 
thats something thats being investigated said dan evans 
a former senator from washington state who is here as part of 
former president jimmy carters observation team were tracking 
that down and i doubt it very much if very many people would be 
involved in that 
several voters interviewed by the associated press said they had 
been unable to wash off the ink and two voters who were asked to 
try to wash the ink off with soap and water were unable to do so 
however a test with common bleach did remove the ink 
one voter said he had tried taking the ink off with gasoline and 
it would not come off others said they had tried lemon or melon 
juice or cola 
voters who had marked thumbs were showing them off to each 
other proud of having voted

unconventional airplane designer burt 
rutan whose voyager flew around the world without refueling has 
built a new combat jet that flies in the face of the hightech 
highcost aviation design ethic 
the first test model of the new plane named ares will be 
rolled out monday at rutans scaled composites inc at mojave 
airport in the california high desert 
the plane intended to provide minimum complexity maintenance 
and acquisition costs is aimed more at foreign markets than the 
hightech us military and its expensive aircraft 
rutans scaled composites developed the jet for about 2 
million a fraction of the normal development cost of a military 
plane 
designed as a light attack aircraft the twintailed ares is 
constructed of composite materials and powered by a single turbofan 
engine 
composites are construction materials such as graphite and epoxy 
that offer strength without the weight of traditional aviation 
metals 
the most distinctive outward feature is the rutan specialty a 
canard a small wing forward of the main wing that increases 
stability 
the name comes from the greek god of war but is used as an 
acronym for agile responsive effective support 
the jet was designed to be armed with a 25mm gun and serve a 
primary role in close air support and against helicopters it could 
also be armed with airtoair and airtoground missiles a 
twoseat version is envisioned for forward air control and training 
missions 
ares is also suggested for border patrol and reconnaissance 
duties as well as drug interdiction missions 
overseas sales are the most likely marketing option the us 
air force has its sights on highperformance highcapability jets 
like the f16 and the developing stealth aircraft technology the 
army has focused its aviation strategy on helicopters 
rutan gained worldwide fame for designing voyager the delicate 
slender airplane that his brother dick and copilot jeana yeager 
flew around the world nonstop on a single tank of fuel 
other planes had flown around the world by being refueled in 
flight but none had ever made it on their own 
rutan used composite carbonfiber honeycomb materials for light 
weight a canard and fuelstingy engines to give voyager the 
ability to keep itself aloft for the nineday 25000mile flight 
in december 1986

poland and israel are expected to restore 
full diplomatic relations during a visit by israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens who was to arrive monday 
the official pap news agency said polands decision to restore 
ties broken in 1967 acknowledges the error of the decision to 
sever them and its consequences including an antisemitic purge in 
1968 
all warsaw pact nations except romania cut diplomatic relations 
with israel after the 1967 middle east war when israel occupied 
arab territory poland will be the second country to restore ties 
after hungary which took the step last september 
polishisraeli relations have steadily improved since 1986 when 
each country established an interest section in the others 
capital the interest sections initially maintained through a 
second country with full diplomatic standing were elevated to 
diplomatic missions on jan 1 1989 
the period of abnormality in our contacts is over and now we 
should simply embark on building the new structure of relations and 
fill it with concrete contents mordechai palzur head of the 
israeli mission in warsaw told the zycie warszawy newspaper last 
week 
history has given polishisraeli contacts a special 
character palzur said 
more than 35 million jews lived in prewar poland 3 million of 
whom were killed by the nazis during the world war ii occupation 
most of the 500000 who survived emigrated after the war or 
following waves of antisemitism the most significant of which 
came in 1968 as a result of an internal political struggle there 
are now only several thousand jews in poland 
poland is ready to welcome back those who emigrated and 
restore polish citizenship pap said 
in addition the agency said poland is prepared to consider 
compensation for the emigres although negotiations have not begun 
polands new solidarityled government is pursuing a course of 
evenhanded diplomacy in the middle east and is seeking improved 
relations with arab nations a foreign ministry official krzysztof 
plominski said in a recent interview 
since september poland has established relations for the first 
time with the united arab emirates oman and katar 
last year poland withdrew a small stipend it provided to the 
palestinian liberation organizations diplomatic mission in warsaw 
however foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski meeting arab 
diplomts in january assured them that poland supports the 
palestinians right to a homeland

president corazon aquino thanked 
thousands of cheering people sunday for supporting her during 
repeated coup attempts and accused an opposition senator of 
plotting against her 
speaking on the fourth anniversary of the revolution that 
toppled president ferdinand marcos and brought her to power mrs 
aquino told 30000 people no matter how great the threats are 
we will thwart their dark plans 
mrs aquino who has survived six coup attempts denounced 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile saying he was trying to rewrite 
the history of the militarycivilian revolt on feb 2225 1986 
that became known as the people power uprising 
the rebellion began with a military mutiny led by thendefense 
minister enrile that eventually succeeded when hundreds of 
thousands of civilians poured into the streets to protect mutineers 
from marcos tanks 
in a radio interview sunday mrs aquino said the enrile 
alliance was a shotgun marriage that fell apart because of 
plots against her enrile was fired as a minister in november 1986 
after a failed coup by his followers 
on friday he apologized for having helped install mrs 
aquino 
on sunday enrile told reporters that he would not answer her 
in equal measure for her denunciation of him in a statement 
enrile also said he felt sorry for her for getting too emotional 
in discussing issues 
last month the national bureau of investigation recommended 
rebellion charges against enrile for alleged links to a december 
coup attempt 
enrile denied the charge and a panel of government lawyers 
investigating the coup attempt has not decided whether to indict 
the senator 
never have i heard of such a thing as an enrile power 
revolution mrs aquino told the cheering crowd i will talk to 
mr enrile or his minions if they are listening mr enrile have 
you no shame 
she said that without popular support enrile and his supporters 
would have been crushed by marcos and that enrile gets very 
nervous in a crisis 
be a man she added or better yet be a woman she 
thanked the people for their support saying without you enrile 
could have harmed me and i would not be president now you did not 
abandon me 
she noted that four years ago enrile had admitted to massive 
cheating in the feb 7 1986 election in which marcos was 
proclaimed the winner by his rubberstamp parliament enrile also 
admitted faking an ambush on himself in 1972 which marcos used as 
a pretext for declaring eight years of martial law 
mrs aquino called enrile the great kibitzer who wanted to 
grab the ball as soon as his team was losing and be team captain 
himself a reference to his abandoning marcos in 1986 
the problem with kibitzers is that they get very nervous in a 
crisis she said so because of his fear of marcos he called 
on the peoples help and we remember him confessing to all his 
sins 
more than 5000 troops were deployed around manila during the 
outdoor rally because of continuing threats by restive members of 
the military many of whom played key roles in the 1986 mutiny but 
later broke with mrs aquino

the nations governors put their stamp sunday 
on national education goals but got no encouragement from the 
white house for the prospect of financial help from a peace 
dividend 
our aim is excellence in education said gov bill clinton 
of arkansas as he offered the goals to the national governors 
association for approval 
the arkansas democrat added that i do not believe we will 
achieve them the goals unless we dramatically change our 
behavior 
the changes referred to by clinton were included in a series of 
objectives that would put the governors on record as pressing for 
specific steps toward implementing the goals first outlined by 
president bush in his state of the union address last month 
the governors also adopted a resolution urging the president to 
allocate any defense budget savings toward education as well as 
reducing the federal budget deficit and other domestic needs 
we have to get this peace dividend said gov roy romer of 
colorado or else were going to have to make some other change in 
this countrys policies or else were not going to close the gap 
that weve created 
romer worked with fellow democratic gov mario cuomo of new york 
in drafting the resolution cuomo did not attend the nga session 
the resolution called on the president to dedicate the peace 
dividend in a balanced manner between the federal budget deficit 
education and other productivity investments 
earlier romer failed in an attempt to get the governors to 
adopt a resolution that urged the president to direct substantial 
federal resources from defense to educational needs and other 
productivity investments 
otherwise i dont believe we are going to get the attention 
of the federal establishment in helping us meet the goals we have 
today romer said 
at a state dinner at the white house bush toasted the governors 
and what he called our commitment to work together toward an 
american education system that is second to none 
we came together not as republicans and democrats not as 
partisan competitors but as fellow chief executives with our 
hearts and minds focused on a single goal the future of our kids 
the future of our country said bush 
iowa gov terry branstad the governors chairman said we 
all expect that theres a lot of work ahead of us he raised his 
glass to both the president and barbara bush saying i think we 
recognize that the first lady may have had some influence on the 
president in this area 
the governors were returning to the white house monday to meet 
with bush 
among the earliest reaction to the governors action was sharp 
criticism from timothy j dyer executive director of the national 
association of secondary school principals 
americas governors receive an aplus for rhetoric but fail 
economics said dyer their goals are lofty patriotic noble 
and certainly what we all would like however without resources 
they are merely wishes 
the governors also heard an appeal from four mayors for more 
resources for their efforts to combat drugs 
the mayors sought the governors support in allowing some 
federal funds for drug programs to go directly to major cities 
rather than be channeled through the state governments 
testifying were mayors richard l berkley of kansas city mo 
w wilson goode of philadelphia sue myrick of charlotte nc and 
maureen oconnor of san diego 
get those federal dollars where theyre needed most 
appealed goode 
we mayors want direct funding for cities because it doesnt 
always get to us said myrick 
the educational objectives were drafted in consultation with the 
white house and were broad enough to be acceptable to all 
but on the touchier question of how to pay for improved 
education the governors got no commitments from richard g darman 
the white house budget director 
darman reminded the governors that the budget bush sent to 
congress for the next fiscal year included a 500 million increase 
in federal funding for the head start program 
but beyond that darman would only say that the political 
system is going to have to have its debate over the division of 
responsibility 
romer contended that for the past 50 years the federal 
government had been taking a growing share of the nations tax base 
and using much of it for national security 
i firmly believe the threat to our security is no longer 
superior military forces romer said it is inadequate skill 
levels 
you have the tax base weve got the problem the colorado 
governor said 
romer asked darman if he would consider taking a percentage of 
federal tax receipts and sending it to the states to be used as 
state officials decide 
ill be happy to have us look at any specific proposal 
darman replied im not entirely sure i agree with your premise 
democratic gov richard celeste of ohio asked darman about some 
250 billion of unexpended pentagon obligations that might no 
longer be needed 
the budget director said those pentagon funds were in contracts 
which require the government to pay a penalty if it cancels them 
he said the savings wont be anywhere near the number that you 
mentioned 
the education goals called for improvement in preschool 
programs so that all children in america will start school ready 
to learn 
others called for increasing the high school graduation rate to 
90 percent and improving student competency in subjects such as 
english mathematics science history and geography

a fence separating poorly tended graves for 
blacks from nicely kept graves for whites must come down says a 
judge who further ordered an end to 125 years of unequal upkeep in 
a private cemetery 
lebanons blacks call the back of ryder cemetery the jungle 
because weeds trash and brambles have overrun the more than 200 
graves of their loved ones on the other side of a rusty wire fence 
are graves for whites with gleaming tombstones on welltended 
grassy knolls 
it was wrong said norman moore former president of the 
marionwashington county chapter of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people it was degrading to see 
the plaintiffs the local naacp and some individuals say they 
hope the order which comes seven years after a lawsuit was filed 
over the practice will finally put a disturbing remnant of 
segregation to rest 
elizabeth mendel ryder cemetery cos lawyer said her client 
will decide whether to appeal after us district judge charles 
allen specifies what work needs to be done 
the judges order issued earlier this month simply directs the 
cemetery to remove the wire fence and provide equal care to all 
sections 
three years ago the cost of getting the black side up to the 
white sides maintenance level was estimated at 50000 
the 30acre cemetery incorporated on land donated in 1865 by a 
german immigrant appears to have been segregated from the start 
although no records exist to explain the arrangement the cemetery 
company never maintained the colored section or took money for 
plots in it but left maintenance to blacks who sometimes 
collected fees 
for more than 10 years blacks willing to buy the 200 plots 
have been buried with whites on the cemeterys welltended side 
but most blacks say they want to be laid to rest near relatives 
in the black burial ground 
in the summer the weeds are up over my head said lily mae 
bell whose husband is buried on the black side and whose son is on 
the white side 
bell 71 said she likes to visit both graves but finds it a 
chore to pick her way around the fence which is topped with barbed 
wire and make her way through the field 
you really get muddy said bell who was a plaintiff in the 
suit 
thelma riley 63 another plaintiff said the fence is what 
burned me up you go and see it and wonder why i told somebody 
nobodys ever going to come up out of the grave and walk over to 
the other side

hampshire college has produced nine oscar 
nominees in its 19year history an achievement that alumni say 
showcases the starring role of their designyourowndegree 
curriculum 
the whole thing just boils down to a very simple thing it 
is the proof that hampshire college not only works which 20 years 
ago was a big question mark but it works fantastically said 
graduate ken burns 
burns has been nominated twice for an academy award in the 
documentary category for brooklyn bridge and the statue of 
liberty 
robert epstein one of two hampshire graduates to win oscars 
was nominated this year in the best fulllength documentary feature 
category as a codirector of common threads stories from the 
quilt the documentary is about the aids quilt being pieced 
together in front of the white house 
epstein took home an academy award in 1985 for his documentary 
on harvey milk the san francisco homosexual politician who was 
murdered 
in all graduates have been nominated nine times for academy 
awards 
in 1986 graduate thomas sigel won in the best documentary short 
category for his film witness to war doctor charley clemens 
hampshire opened in 1970 as an alternative to the traditional 
education offered at nearby smith amherst and mount holyoke 
colleges and the university of massachusetts 
students at the college design their own courses of study and 
advance through three divisional examinations requiring them to 
complete individual research projects 
that freedom may explain why students have been able to catch 
the eye of the academy film professor jerome leibling said 
the fact that they think they can design it and do it 
themselves film lends itself to that its disciplined but 
its also spontaneous we allow that to happen theyre not being 
being graded or pushed and they can absorb a great deal he said 
burns who is finishing a ninepart history of the civil war to 
be broadcast on public television said hampshire students werent 
spoonfed and that has really put us in a good position to 
capitalize on our particular area of expertise when we got out into 
the real world 
film graduates have to complete a film and leibling said some of 
the most successful alumni produced work that helped them step up 
to the professional level 
i think thats very important he said we have an idea 
that it is doable and that they can do it and we have the equipment 
and the time 
he said he wasnt sure why students have been so successful in 
the field of documentary and short films although he noted others 
have gone on to more commercial success in hollywood

the bush administration confirmed sunday that 
it has determined marijuana production in mexico is much higher 
than it previously estimated but downplayed reports of a tenfold 
increase 
the los angeles times on sunday reported new us figures to be 
released this week concluded mexico produces 10 times more 
marijuana than previously beleived 
the newspaper said the official us estimate derived from cia 
spy satellite photographs concluded that mexico produced 47500 
metric tons of marijuana in 1989 in 1988 the us estimated 
mexicos production at 4750 metric tons 
katherine shaw spokeswoman for the state departments 
international narcotics section said the agency would release an 
annual report on foreign narcotic production and antidrug efforts 
later this week 
this is not a tenfold increase in one year shaw said of 
estimates on mexican marijuana production this is a revised 
estimate for 1989 theres a high probability things were much 
higher than we thought for a long time 
shaw said the estimates for the previous few years were 
relatively low and the new figure for 1989 is based on new 
methodology the figure for 1988 she said was unsupportable 
its just been much higher than weve thought and this year we 
can prove it 
us officials have long suspected mexico was underestimating 
its marijuana production figures the us figures are expected to 
be released thursday the times said 
shaw would not confirm the 47500 metric ton production figure 
reported by the times 
an administraation official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the number was in the ball park and noted that 
it reflected marijuana production after eradication efforts 
antidrug officials told the newspaper the figures dont mean 
production in mexico has exploded but rather that previous 
estimates based largely on information supplied by the mexican 
government were too low 
despite the new information the bush administration plans to 
certify that the mexican government has cooperated in illegal drug 
suppression and is eligible for foreign aid the paper said but 
the disclosure is expected to inflame congress 
when asked whether mexico would be certified as having 
cooperated sufficiently in antidrug efforts to receive its full 
foreign aid shaw said the president hasnt signed any piece of 
paper yet 
mexicos deputy attorney general javier coello trejo when told 
of the figures during a meeting with drug enforcement 
administration chief john c lawn nearly went into apoplexy 
the times said quoting a source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but not everyone inside the drug enforcement administration is 
convinced the new figures are correct including john p sutton 
who heads the agencys cannabis investigation section 
he called the estimates inordinate and wild and said the 
us analysts mistakenly included in their count ditch weed 
wildgrowing marijuana that lacks the kick of cannabis sold for 
smoking and has no commercial value he also suggested other 
vegetation may have been included in the marijuana count 
frank shults dea spokesman said the development of 
production estimates is very soft and it always has been 
we never say we know how much of any drug is growing 
anywhere he added 
but others speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
conclusions were solid this is the first time weve done it 
right onehigh ranking source told the newspaper the satellite 
pictures permitted estimates from areas where the mexican 
government previously denied surveillance flights 
by contrast estimates for colombian marijuana production went 
up to 2810 metric tons for 1989 a slight increase from the 2740 
metric tons reported for 1988 in the united states production for 
1989 was estimated at 5500 metric tons with 4600 metric tons for 
1988 
other strains between the bush administration and mexico include 
a disclosure that the mexican ruling party reportedly made a covert 
contribution of 11 million to the reelection campaign of 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
the mexican government has also expressed anger over us 
complaints of official footdragging and failure to cooperate in 
the investigation of the kidnapping and murder of dea agent enrique 
camarena in 1985

closed roads ticket sales peaked saturday afternoon hours before

payouts in saturdays lotto was more than 72 million she said 
the large grand prize and high sales volume followed three 
straight rollovers of the lotto jackpot after no one matched all 
six numbers in the drawings of feb 3 feb 10 and feb 17 in its 
16year history the illinois lottery has never had a weekly 
jackpot roll over four times

driven by a rare chance for 
permission to build homes in this scenic ski and gambling resort 
about 140 people spent a fourth day camped outside the library in 
snow and belowzero temperatures 
the wouldbe builders some huddled in crudely built igloos and 
snow caves held their ground even though the county government on 
friday withdrew a plan to issue the coveted permits on a 
firstcome firstserved basis monday morning a smaller contingent 
waited outside city hall hoping for a crack at a separate batch of 
permits controlled by the city government 
the impromptu campout demonstrates the voracious appetite for 
property in this town that boasts ski slopes scenic vistas and a 
chance to gamble just across the state line in nevada 
tough antidevelopment policies enacted in the early 1970s have 
kept construction at a virtual standstill around lake tahoe in the 
sierra nevada within a days drive of san francisco 
the people in front of us have waited 14 years to build on 
their lot said diane rosner one of about 60 outside city hall 
concerned about the line and spurred by allegations of 
favoritism in the permit process the el dorado county board of 
supervisors voted friday to cancel their plans to issue 123 permits 
by lottery 
but the applicants who began lining up wednesday vowed to 
stay and to sue if the lottery didnt proceed 
we do not intend to be dispersed said doug rosner a south 
lake tahoe real estate broker who was 34th in the line sunday 
dale sare an attorney for about 100 permit applicants said his 
clients would to remain in line until monday morning and will sue 
unless the county issues the permits 
with rare exceptions building has been stopped in the tahoe 
basin since the early 1970s in an effort to save lake tahoe from 
being clogged with algae caused by nutrients that wash off cleared 
land and into the lake 
a settlement to numerous lawsuits was recently reached and 
officials of the city and four counties which have territory in the 
moratorium area are working out how to issue permits 
in an emergency session late friday county supervisors withdrew 
their plan saying they would decide march 6 how to issue the 
permits 
the city of south lake tahoe planned to make 62 permits 
available friday on a firstcome firstserved basis

after founding the christian democratic party duarte was 
tortured and exiled for seven years he returned in 1980 and headed

california attorney general john van de 
kamp formally launched his campaign for governor sunday in rival 
dianne feinsteins political backyard with a scathing attack on her 
record as mayor of san francisco 
van de kamp began with a rally at the mission high school boys 
gymnasium in the heart of the city where feinstein served nine 
years as mayor and ripped into feinsteins fiscal management and 
her record on civil rights insurance the environment and womens 
issues 
dianne feinsteins budget mismanagement turned the city by the 
bay into the city that could not pay van de kamp said accusing 
her of being evasive on how she would balance the state budget 
van de kamp describing himself as a candidate who is going to 
change california with environmental political ethics and drug 
reforms 
a spokesman for feinstein called van de kamps attack a sign of 
desperation in the wake of the most recent poll on the june 5 
democratic primary in which the former mayor pulled ahead of the 
attorney general 
the kickoff announcement is only a formality since van de kamp 
like feinstein has been actively campaigning for a year and leads 
feinstein in fund raising by 46 million to 23 million 
the winner of their june 5 primary will face the expected 
republican nominee us sen pete wilson in november incumbent 
gov george deukmejian a republican is retiring 
van de kamps campaign for governor is tied closely to three 
ballot initiatives he is sponsoring on the environment legislative 
ethics and crime the content of van de kamps initiatives has also 
stirred controversy part of his crime initiative duplicates an 
initiative sponsored by wilson except for deletion of privacy 
language which van de kamp claims could undermine a womans right 
to abortion and his political ethics initiative contains a 
controversial limit on the terms of legislators 
the ethics proposal has strained van de kamps relations with 
legislative leaders of his own party not only because of the 
proposed limit on their terms but especially because of a 
supporting article van de kamp wrote in which he said of the 
legislature if we want clean government its time to drain the 
swamp 
van de kamp 54 is a member of the wealthy pasadena family 
which formerly owned the frozen food company and the southern 
california bakery chain which still carry the family name 
before his election as attorney general in 1982 van de kamp 
served seven years as los angeles county district attorney five 
years as federal public defender and two years as assistant federal 
public defender in los angeles

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany agreed in weekend talks that 
a unified germany would continue as a full member of nato 
including military participation in the western alliance kohl said

after two days of discussions regarding delicate issues of a 
unified germany kohl said he recognizes the legitimate security 
interests of all states in europe particularly poland 
nobody needs to be afraid the west german leader said bush 
chimed in that if he were alarmed about the prospect of a single 
germany he would not be endorsing reunification as he had 
several times previously

world war ii that a new germany would seek to regain border 
territory that was formerly under german rule

as his own winning kudos from congress and grabbing headlines with 
talk of blood money and trading death for corporate profits 
following the wellworn path of previous federal health 
officials sullivan the secretary of health and human services 
has cranked up the war of words against tobacco companies to new 
heights 
he certainly has found an area where he has been willing to be 
outspoken and has taken the leadership said rep henry waxman 
dcalif chairman of the house energy and commerce health 
subcommittee 
but some say smoking is a safe issue since sullivan isnt 
attacking tobacco subsidies or proposing a ban on advertising and 
they say sullivan who for nearly a year has run the federal 
department with the largest budget has yet to show such bold 
leadership on the larger issues confronting the administration 
including the nations soaring healthcare bill

drexel burnham lambert inc owes millions of 
dollars to lawyers who helped defend the collapsed wall street firm 
and its employees during the governments lengthy insider trading 
investigation 
atop the list is drexels main outside counsel which has claims 
to 21 million in back fees and attorneys for indicted junk bond 
exking michael milken whose monthly allowance of about 1 million 
wound down when drexel went belly up 
there are outstanding fees they havent paid and theyre not 
going to pay anything going forward said a milken associate who 
asked not to be named 
when drexel became entangled in the largest wall street criminal 
probe ever the firm promised to pick up the tab for all current or 
former employees who became involved 
in addition the demise of the firm that dominated wall street 
junkbond dealmaking is affecting big law firms that derived a 
large amount of work from drexels criminal woes and its daytoday 
securities business 
a slowdown on wall street investment banking firms need 
lawyers for activities from underwriting stocks to completing 
mergers hasnt helped either 
there are more than a few lawyers who will be poorer for all 
this said columbia university law professor harvey goldschmid 
because of the deals and the prominence drexel has been a 
terribly important player for a meaningful part of the legal 
community in new york 
roger meltzer a partner with cahill gordon amp reindel which has 
represented drexel for 10 years conceded that drexels demise 
would hurt but added that the firm has a substantial and diverse 
client base the firm reportedly did about 10 million in drexel 
business a year cahill gordon said in court papers it is owed 21 
million 
this firm is not based on the financial health of one 
client meltzer asserted never has been never will be 
drexel said it spent 75 million on legal fees associated with 
its criminal and civil troubles last year when it pleaded guilty 
to six felonies and paid 500 million of 650 million owed in 
government penalties a mountain of litigation spawned by drexels 
behavior still is outstanding 
the governments investigation made drexel a legal cottage 
industry and its collapse leaves bills scattered from coast to 
coast lawyers for current and former employees said they expect to 
press for some of the millions owed at least one major new york 
firm has its bankruptcy lawyer examining the issue 
everybody would like to be paid said gerald lefcourt who 
represents bruce newberg a former drexel junk bond trader who has 
been convicted of securities fraud and was indicted along with 
milken i dont know whether we will or wont 
with drexel busy disposing of billions of dollars in securities 
holdings and addressing the thorny matter of having paid 260 
million in bonuses as its financial fortunes sank paying more 
money to lawyers hasnt been a priority 
theyre pretty busy i havent been able to get through 
said daniel bookin a san francisco attorney for lisa jones a 
former drexel bond trading assistant who is appealing her 
conviction for lying to a federal grand jury 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said backedup legal bills 
will be dealt with in due course but he didnt know how much 
was owed anreder said drexel had for the time stopped paying for 
individuals new legal expenses 
drexel reportedly owes milken attorneys mostly at the new york 
firm paul weiss rifkind wharton amp garrison back pay for three 
or four months consistent with what other firms representing 
drexel people claim is due 
the firm capped spending by milkens criminal defense team last 
summer after it had rung up gargantuan legal bills to pay for two 
fulltime lawyers who reportedly bill out at 450 an hour and a 
football team worth of associates 
drexel also anted up for milkens defense against civil lawsuits 
claiming his actions as head of drexels highyield bond division 
defrauded investors 
the arrangement was unusual to begin with drexel paying to 
defend the man who allegedly masterminded the crimes to which the 
firm admitted a spokesman for milken said the indicted financier 
would foot his own expenses from now on 
for milken who made 550 million in 1987 that wont be a 
problem other clients such as lisa jones depended on drexel to 
pay the bills but bookin her attorney said his firm will not 
abandon lisa jones 
no attorneys have as yet filed claims against the firm or its 
parent drexel burnham lambert group inc which filed for chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection on feb 13 seeking to get the back pay 
the dismantling of drexel also has created legal complications 
for civil claimants who say they were defrauded by drexel trading 
in the past and that means more work for lawyers 
drexels liquidation doesnt absolve the firm from civil 
wrongdoing and lawyers said they will seek to recover assets from 
the firm if their claims are upheld they also said they will try 
to find out whether drexel wrongfully drained away assets 
including the 1989 bonuses 
they still have all their legal liabilities and are not 
protected by a bankruptcy case said dan mogan a san diego 
attorney representing shareholders of companies with which drexel 
had dealings
