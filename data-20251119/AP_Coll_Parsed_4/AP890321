supporters of human rights champion andrei d 
sakharov succeeded tuesday in forcing a second round of elections in 
the soviet academy of sciences for delegates to the new parliament 
improving sakharovs chances to run 
the official tass news agency said only eight of 23 officially 
backed candidates were elected in the first round of voting tuesday 
since the academy will have 20 seats in the new 2250seat congress 
of peoples deputies 12 seats will be up for grabs in the next 
round of elections 
partisans of sakharov had hoped to defeat some of the official 
candidates on the ballot approval of the academys leadership was 
needed to run and force a new round of voting with sakharov and 
other reformminded academicians running 
although sakharov had been nominated by 55 institutions for a 
seat in the new legislature his name was not among those placed on 
the final candidate list by the academys leadership 
under the new election law the academy will be forced to select 
new candidates and submit them to the membership 
the voting tuesday by more than 1300 academy members and 
delegates from top soviet research institutes took place in the 
marblefloored hall of moscows palace of youth 
sakharov a physicist and dean of the soviet human rights 
movement won the nobel peace prize in 1975 
also tuesday the legislative campaign of maverick populist boris 
n yeltsin picked up steam as his criticism of bureaucracy and 
failed economic reform received a warm welcome in his opponents 
backyard 
yeltsin who has become an antiestablishment symbol in the city 
that he once ran as communist party chief criticized the election 
law under which he is running as well as the party itself for 
nominating only 100 candidates for its 100 seats in the new 
legislature 
we need direct elections from top to bottom including for the 
presidency the post held by mikhail s gorbachev yeltsin said 
the party election carried out at a central committee meeting last 
week is not the best example of democracy for our society he 
said 
but yeltsin said he recognized gorbachev as the countrys leader 
i never have set myself up as an alternative to comrade 
gorbachev he said 
his booming voice occasionally cracking from overuse yeltsin 
spoke and answered questions for three hours in a conference hall at 
the giant zil factory that is run by yevgeny brakov his opponent in 
the march 26 election for a seat representing moscow in the congress 
about 1000 people were on hand and they greeted yeltsin warmly 
workers outside the meeting hall spoke well of brakov but said 
yeltsin had more experience and that his support was strong among 
the 80000 workers at the giant conglomeration that produces 
limousines refrigerators and freezers and a variety of other 
durable goods 
brakov addressed a campaign rally elsewhere in moscow 
yeltsins candidacy has been thust into the limelight by what he 
says is a campaign organized against him by the current moscow party 
leaders supporters have plastered campaign posters on walls all 
over the city 
last week the party central committee published yeltsins speech 
that led to his being sacked as moscow party leader in november 
1987 in which he criticized the partys style of leadership and 
warned of a possible stalinlike cult of personality developing 
around gorbachev 
the central committee later formed a commission to investigate 
complaints that yeltsin advocates a multiparty system and holds 
other views at odds with party policies 
those perceived attacks on yeltsin led to march through moscow by 
thousands of supporters sunday and warnings monday by an interior 
ministry officials that such demonstrations disrupt public order 
yeltsin denied tuesday he advocates competition for the communist 
party however he said too many topics have been prohibited for too 
long 
society is too dynamic and it is too difficult to say what will 
happen in several years yeltsin said lets not make this topic 
forbidden and allow it to be discussed in the press 
yeltsin hammered party and government bureaucracy and failed 
economic reforms the party adopted a policy last week to encourage 
longterm leases by individual farmers to try to improve the 
efficiency of the backward agricultural system and solve the 
socalled food question 
we are already approaching the food question for the third 
time and all the time its halfmeasures halfmeasures yeltsin 
said the soviet union is suffering from inflation and a rather 
deadend economic policy that has eroded the rubles buying power 
by 60 percent he said 
onethird of the seats in the congress are reserved for 
representatives of the party its affiliates and social and 
professional organizations gorbachev already has been elected as a 
delegate from the communist party 
bovin a wellknown figure in the west failed to win one of the 
10 seats from the union of journalists 
in a separate election from the union of writers editor sergei 
zalygin of the literary journal novy mir and writer valentin 
rasputin who stresses ecological issues were among the 10 selected

main penitentiary tuesday night and authorities said three 
prisoners and one guard were wounded 
vitelio ramos commander of mariona prison outside mejicanos 
told the associated press the rebels attacked from three sides 
he said they failed to penetrate the prison itself which is 
surrounded by a 12foothigh cinderblock wall topped with barbed 
wire and razor blades but did cut through the 10foothigh wire 
fence around the complex 
a heavy exchange of fire lasted about 30 minutes according to 
several combatants the rebels blew a hole in the prisons southern 
wall and one guard said several prisoners escaped 
ramos said he could not confirm that until the prisoners were 
counted 
spent shells from ak47 assault rifles lay scattered where the 
rebels paused to fire

one prison guard was seriously wounded 
nearly 1800 men are incarcerated in mariona each year the 
prison undergoes a few attacks by rebels waging a 9yearold war 
against the usbacked government 
the rebels consider dozens of the inmates as political prisoners 
and apparently attack the institution with the intention of freeing 
them

allowed into the penitentiary after the attack 
the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln is the 
rebel army

said about 150 soldiers reinforced the guards he also estimated the 
attacking force at about 300 
two of the three wounded prisoners were able to walk with 
assistance the third was carried out unconscious and soaked with 
blood all were placed on a truck for transport to the hospital

more americans should be taking action to 
reduce the amount of radioactive radon gas in their homes because 
longterm exposure to the gas increases the risk of lung cancer 
federal regulators said tuesday 
us environmental protection agency officials are concerned that 
not enough homeowners are taking advantage of methods that can 
reduce radon concentrations inside homes to safer levels the 
officials told a national convention of radon monitoring 
associations 
were not seeing as many people mitigating or fixing the 
problem as wed like our concern is that people may think the 
problem is too expensive to fix said michael mardis chief of the 
epas washingtonbased radon mitigation prevention and quality 
assurance branch the good news is you can do something about it 
radon is an odorless invisible gas which is released as a result 
of the natural decay of uranium in soil the uranium degenerates to 
form radium which decays into radon the gas can filter into houses 
from the soil through cracks in foundations and walls that contact 
the ground 
mardis said the epa has identified several methods for reducing 
radon in homes such techniques include sealing of basement cracks 
and installation of fans which can suck concentrations of the gas 
from under houses 
he said a homeowner can buy a radon measuring device for 10 to 
25 or hire a contractor to measure and remove the gas mardis said 
the epa has distributed to all 50 state health departments a list of 
contractors who can measure radon concentrations in homes 
the epa also is trying to provide the states with a list of 
contractors who can remove radon mardis said 
he said it would cost a homeowner 1000 to 1500 to reduce 
radon levels in a dwelling he said that cost is comparable with 
expenses for termite treatments or repairs of wet basements 
were not talking about wet feet were talking about lung 
cancer cases in children mardis said i think the big problem 
is you cant see radon you can touch it you cant smell it 
people arent aware of it

in denmark the worlds top breeder of 
minks for fashion pelts are selling at below breakeven prices this 
season more than just prices are depressed 
overproduction warm weather and a long campaign by animal rights 
activisits have pushed many of denmarks 5000 mink farms to the 
brink of bankruptcy 
the stock market crash started it said scott novak who 
represents a new york dealer in exclusive garments who was here for 
an international auction that seemed to end that beautiful run we 
had for a few years 
its too early to look for bargains in buying a mink coat off the 
rack however sewing the furs into garments is skilled work and 
labor costs along with retailers markups are high but prices might 
drop later on 
danish breeders produce 35 percent of all mink furs sold in the 
west last year 124 million mink pelts were sold up from 91 
million in 1986 at the same time falling prices reduced income 
from 394 million to 282 million 
its hard to determine the damage done by the animal activists 
who at times have sprayed paint on the fur coats of women in the 
street 
certainly they hurt us said lester taffer a 59year veteran 
of the trade they murdered us in germany and other places 
the protests began in the 1960s to save animals in the wild from 
trappers but the scope later widened to breeding animals for their 
fur 
skimming 06 percent of the turnover at auctions the 
londonbased international fur trade federation finances a 
countercampaign to promote the fur industry in brochures and films 
a global fraternity of fur buyers assembled in february near 
copenhagen to bid for raw materials that will become the luxurient 
apparel in shops in the fall the danish auction house offers the 
largest collection of mink pelts in the world 
minks were fetching between 15 and 34 per pelt two seasons 
ago amid surging garment sales the same types of pelts brought up 
to 45 percent more 
mink production has set records 
this year well be grading more than 15 million pelts four 
times that of the next largest fur center peter krag president 
of danish fur sales said in an interview 
pelts are graded according to sex size color clarity and 
quality creating hundreds of categories 
the fur business has grown in the last 15 years from small 
handicraft shops to a massproduction industry the far east 
supplies an estimated 40 percent of finished product 
danish fur farming began in the 1920s with wild mink imported 
from north america and fed on the abundance of fish caught in danish 
waters 
after world war ii mink production rose steadily and denmark 
rose to become the world leader production has tripled since 1980 
now the glut of mink pelts is threatening many breeders 
two warm winters in a row have added to furriers woes everyone 
in the trade is praying for an extended latewinter cold snap to 
stimulate demand for fur clothing 
recovery from the slump in fur sales demands at least two 
radically improved seasons even a 10 percent reduction would not 
raise prices unless demand soars 
the important thing is that sales companies are meeting the 
market said william frick who represents a major hong kong 
company 
hong kong and other large consumers of raw pelts have thus far 
been purchasing conservatively protecting themselves against a 
further drop in prices eventually when the market gains confidence 
and orders are placed well see a turnover of garments weve never 
seen before low prices today will benefit tomorrows consumer he 
said

from 18thcentury france to the backroads of 
1960s mississippi to todays corporate manhattan the academy award 
nominees for best picture of 1988 offer a wide range of place and 
theme 
but the frontrunner seems to be rain man the saga of an 
autistic savant kidnapped by his coldhearted brother which has 
already won the directors guild award for its director barry 
levinson 
rain man had its problems before production dustin hoffman 
was intrigued with playing a retarded man gifted with a genius for 
numbers the role of the autistic mans brother a scheming 
salesman was closer to hoffmans age but the actor heeded his 
agents advice after hoffman and warren beattys ishtar 
disaster dont put two middleaged actors on the screen hearthrob 
tom cruise jumped at the chance to act with hoffman 
directors martin brest steven spielberg and sydney pollack 
undertook rain man in succession all three withdrew for various 
reasons the project soon began to look like one of those dream 
movies that never get made 
then hoffman met levinson good morning vietnam at a 
performance of the cirque de soleil in santa monica calif levinson 
directed rain man under schedule and 25 million under the 24 
million budget including an estimated 5 million apiece for the 
stars the film has grossed 1261 million 
dangerous liaisons is another film with an unsettled history 
the source material choderlos de laclos 1782 novel about sexual 
intrigue among french aristocrats long had been overlooked by a 
hollywood that disfavored costume dramas dont give me any 
pictures where they write with feathers jack warner is reported 
to have once said 
when les liaisons dangereuses became a hit play in london and 
new york lorimar telepictures bought the rights and hired the 
playwright christopher hampton to write the script the movie was 
filmed in france as lorimars fortunes were flagging also milos 
forman was shooting another version of laclos work 
after british director stephen frears had made dangerous 
liaisons the title anglicized for americans lorimar sold out to 
warner bros despite fears the movie would be ditched warners has 
given it a decent and slow release hoping for wordofmouth 
support the gross after 11 weeks 212 million 
the most controversial of the film nominees is mississippi 
burning a fictionalized account of the investigation of the 1964 
murder of three civil rights worker in neshoba county miss the 
chris gerolmo script directed by alan parker tells the story 
through the eyes of two fbi investigators played by gene hackman 
and willem dafoe 
mississippi burning was attacked by those who participated 
and reported the 1964 freedom summer said author david halberstam 
who covered the story for the new york times parker has taken a 
terribly moving and haunting story and he has betrayed it turned it 
into a martinandlewis slapstick between two cops its a bad 
movie mississippi false 
it was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did 
not show one black role model that todays youth who look at the 
movie could remember said myrlie evers whose activist husband 
medgar evers was murdered by white segregationists outside his 
mississippi home in 1963 
gerolmo not an oscar nominee replied i never understood this 
to be hollywoods civil rights picture its an exciting story 
about something important you see our moral failures and greatness 
it allows us to see america at its very worst and also to see people 
who displayed great moral courage 
mississippi burning the fbi code for the case drew mixed 
reviews several awards and only fair business 288 million in 13 
weeks 
the accidental tourist marks the third collaboration between 
actor william hurt and director lawrence kasdan they also worked 
together on body heat and the big chill in the new film 
hurt plays a travel writer who writes books for people who hate to 
travel his private life is torn between his estranged wife 
kathleen turner and an uninhibited dog trainer geena davis 
while reviews were generally excellent some criticized the 
passivity of hurts character whats wrong with the heroism of a 
man who has traveled two inches hurt replies that two inches 
is very profound 
the accidental tourist has had a fairly good response at the 
box office 288 million in 11 weeks but receipts have dropped off 
in recent weeks 
working girl gives top billing to harrison ford and sigourney 
weaver but they are virtually supporting players to thirdbilled 
melanie griffith she plays the central figure of tess mcgill a 
shrewd ambitious secretary who uses tricks worthy of the cia to 
climb to the top of the corporate ladder 
the script bounced around 20th century fox until it reached mike 
nichols who agreed to direct one of the hardest things for a 
director to find in the 80s is a good story he says 
every actress in town wanted this part says melanie 
griffith you should see the script im on every page 
because nichols insisted on the littleknown griffith you can 
see right into her feelings he said fox paid big salaries to 
ford and weaver to assure star value 
though some critics twitted working girl as a fairy tale 
most were favorable audiences agreed the gross so far 542 
million in 11 weeks

george a 36yearold former heroin addict who 
beat his wife is lying to himself 
the last altercation got out of hand but before i could 
wrestle the knife from my wifes hand six cops busted in the door 
and arrested me they didnt even want to listen to my side of the 
story 
george can tell his story when hes at the queens family conflict 
center among six other men who have inflicted violence on their 
households 
i dont know how hard i hit when i get angry he says how 
can i stay without drugs when the person lying in bed is sniffing 
all the coke in town if i continue to be passive shes going to 
bring me down 
shes the one who has to get help or else im getting a 
divorce 
if shes the one who needs help for her cocaine problem then 
why are you here interrupted group leader jerome balcom balcom 
explained later that george kept on straying away from the fact 
that he hit his wife 
more than 18 million women will be punched kicked or assaulted 
with a weapon this year according to a university of new hampshire 
family research lab study about 625 million will be slapped or 
shoved 
that is assuming everyone we interviewed told all said lab 
director murray a straus in my judgment those figures should be 
doubled 
experts say protective court orders may give victims of domestic 
violence temporary security but the only prevention lies in 
education 
lack of communication between the sexes and the inability to 
communicate without violence causes the abuser to react in the only 
way he knows how said ellie ludvigsenjennings of the city 
probation department 
the abusive male is rigid toward sex roles and has a poor 
selfimage and an inability to communicate with his spouse said 
roland maiuro a psychologist and director of the harborview anger 
management program in washington state 
seventyfive percent are drug or alcohol addicts and 98 percent 
were sexually abused or beaten as children said ludvigsenjennings 
we try to stop the pattern before it gets to the point of adult 
abuse 
we also help victims and adolescents because once they are 
abused they just like the men will have the tendency to abuse as 
well 
our goal is to eliminate family violence 
ludvigsenjennings and balcom commander of court officers for 
the state court in westchester county started the conflict center 
in 1984 in response to an increase in domestic violence in new york 
city its six fulltime staffers and 20 volunteers run 15 programs 
on issues linked to family violence including parenting alcohol 
and drug addiction and child abuse 
about 4000 men have participated in five years some 
voluntarily others under court order 
we try to see them the same day they are referred 
ludvigsenjennings said you cant treat violence cases like any 
other cases they need immediate intervention or somebody will get 
seriously hurt 
the aim is to make the abuser understand why he is angry and 
teach him how to deal with that aggression we first teach them 
that they are responsible for their actions that they are wrong to 
hurt their wives and they should learn to think before acting 
said ludvigsenjennings 
most men dont realize what they have done is wrong she said 
the man sees the woman as someone beneath him someone who should 
obey his rules when she doesnt he feels he has every right to 
make her act accordingly 
when we first get them they are full of denial balcom said 
they dont believe theyve done anything wrong and theyll justify 
it until theyre blue in the face 
george was typical he was trying to blame his wifes drug 
habit for their altercations instead of looking at why he was angry 
at her 
group leaders try to convince men they should walk away when they 
feel a situation is getting out of control eventually the abuser 
should be able to let his wife know when he is approaching a 
breaking point so she can leave before it is too late 
the breaking point according to balcom can come at any time 
but usually is after the wife becomes independent of the husband 
sometimes the wife goes to school gets a better job advances 
herself then the man feels inferior less in control and less 
needed by the wife 
counselors try to replace aggressiveness with assertiveness 
you cant expect an abuser to miraculously be cured of all his 
aggressions in a sixweek program it takes time to undo what years 
of abuse have done said ludvigsenjennings if the abuser is 
caught early enough his anger can be controlled but the more 
entrenched the pattern of violence the greater the possibility it 
wont be reversed 
spouse abuse is not at its root a marital problem it is an 
anger problem and even if the couple separates he will most likely 
lash out again she said by not addressing the issue of learning 
different ways of seeing ones self and the opposite sex and not 
addressing the issue of what family violence does we are dumping 
more people into the criminal court system

legislative leaders turned thumbs down monday on a 
proposal to pay impeached gov evan mecham for costs he incurred 
preparing for a recall election that was never held 
mecham said he would now take his fight to the state supreme 
court 
ive been trying to do this the peaceful way he said i 
guess theres no healing to be done we have to fight about 
everything 
arizona law provides for reimbursement in recall elections but 
mecham was impeached by the state house of representatives and 
convicted in the state senate last year before a scheduled recall 
election could be held 
the state supreme court cancelled the election after mechams 
ouster elevated secretary of state rose mofford to the governorship 
but mecham asked for 269325 to reimburse him for expenses incurred 
before the ouster 
the house rejected the request last year but mecham lobbied 
legislative leaders to reconsider the matter this session 
we had our attorneys look at it said john mawhinney the 
senates majority leader this is not a vindictive thing 
the lawyers found no instance in any state where an officeholder 
was paid expenses for an election that did not occur mawhinney said 
based on that house speaker jane hull and senate president 
robert usdane concluded that there being no recall election there 
is no obligation for the state to pay mawhinney said 
mecham was impeached and ousted last year for misuse of funds and 
obstruction of justice

torture and killings of civilians by army 
and government intelligence units is increasing in uganda amnesty 
international charged today 
the londonbased human rights organization said most reports of 
abuses came from northern and eastern uganda where government 
troops have been battling several rebel groups for the past three 
years 
in its report amnesty said about 3000 alleged political 
prisoners are being held without charge or trial most detained by 
the army on suspicion of aiding or belonging to rebel groups 
amnesty said president yoweri museveni who came to power in 
1986 brought an immediate end to the gross human rights 
violations inflicted by previous governments but recent reports of 
rape torture murder and illegal detention generally have been 
ignored by the government 
the group called on the museveni government to investigate the 
reports 
it said it had received a government promise in december to 
investigate reports of army killings of unarmed civilians in 
northern uganda but that a month later two amnesty representatives 
checking the investigations progress were expelled from the area 
where the killings reportedly occurred 
the report noted that musevenis government established a 
commission to investigate human rights abuses during the previous 
regimes of presidents idi amin and milton obote when hundreds of 
thousands of ugandans were killed by army intelligence and 
paramilitary groups 
but it said the commission had been hamperep my lack of resources 
including stationery office equipment and transportation and in 
early 1989 its final report still seemed as far away as ever

scientists at the environmental protection agency 
want to bar the use of a highly toxic insecticide on potatoes and 
imported bananas because its residue poses a health risk to infants 
and children according to a published report 
the recommendation to restrict use of the insecticide aldicarb 
was made on jan 12 by toxicologists from the epas pesticide 
division the new york times reported in tuesdays editions 
the uses of aldicarb on 10 other crops would be allowed to 
continue under the panels proposal because the chemical is not used 
as heavily on those crops and does not leave as much residue as it 
does on potatoes and bananas according to a copy of the epas 
recommendation obtained by the times 
but the report said the risks exceed the benefits when aldicarb 
is used on bananas and potatoes the other crops were peanuts 
oranges grapefruit limes sugar cane soybeans dried beans 
sorghum pecans and coffee 
the document said 15000 to 50000 infato and children a day are 
exposed to enough aldicarb to present a risk of getting ill from 
eating potatoes 
one drop of aldicarb absorbed through the skin can kill an adult 
the times said in children exposure in the concentrations found in 
some potatoes could cause stomach cramps nervous disorders 
headaches and other ailments 
bananas were said to present a risk to as many as 1500 infants 
and children 
in 1985 more than 1000 people reported getting sick in eight 
western states and canada from californiagrown watermelons 
contaminated with the chemical 
the use of aldicarb has been restricted for years in new york 
rhode island and wisconsin because of contamination of underground 
water supplies the epa has found the chemical known by its trade 
name temik in ground water in 22 states it is used widely in 
idaho maine and washington the three biggest potatoproducing 
states 
mary anne ford a spokeswoman for rhonepoulenc sa the french 
company that manufactures aldicarb denied that the chemical is a 
hazard on any food crops 
that data does not reflect any risk to any group including 
infants and children she said 
the epa toxicologists recommendation was presented to dr john 
a moore now acting deputy administrator of the agency he has not 
made a formal response to the report the times said

prime minister bob hawke dogged by 
questions about his personal life has tearfully admitted in a 
television interview to being unfaithful to his wife of 33 years 
hawke told the channel 7 networks newsworld program he has 
committed adultery but said would do so no longer hawke tears 
welling in his eyes said he loved his wife hazel whom he called 
an incredible woman 
the labor party leader said she understood that it was part of 
a pretty volatile exuberant character and she knew my love for her 
had never changed he also made references to his past drinking 
problems 
the interview was to be broadcast nationally tonight 
hawke must call elections in mid1990 and he has said he will 
seek an unprecedented fourth threeyear term as prime minister his 
popularity is believed to be eroding because of rising interest 
rates higher taxes and other economic woes 
the 59yearold premier has been followed by questions about his 
personal life for years but had never admitted he cheated on his 
wife his stunning confession on national television caused a 
sensation 
bob hawke in tears how i cheated on hazel read the headline 
in the sydney morning herald it carried a cartoon portraying hawke 
saying to his wife as she fills in a ballot in a voting booth 
ive been unfaithful do you still love me 
opposition liberal party leader john howard refused comment on 
hawkes admission deputy prime minister lionel bowen said he found 
it interesting but did not elaborate 
clover moore an independent member of the sydney council said 
she thought many women would be angry about infidelity admission 
i think its very cruel of him to publicly humiliate his 
wife she said i think the majority of women would think it is 
in very bad taste to put hazel through such a public demonstration 
the couple celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary two weeks 
ago 
the interview was the second time hawke has broken down on 
national television while making a personal admission in 1984 he 
began crying when he referred to drug problems among members of his 
family 
mrs hawke later went on television to explain that their 
daughter roslyn and her husband matt had been treated for heroin 
addiction 
hawke gave no details about his sexual liaisons in the interview 
a transcript of which was released by both channel 7 and the prime 
ministers office 
a spokesman for hawke said the admission was not new all this 
has been said before said the official who is not allowed to be 
named 
in the interview journalist clive robertson asked hawke what 
people mean when they accuse him of being a womanizer 
they mean i was unfaithful to my wife hawke replied 
robertson is that true 
hawke yes 
robertson did you stop that 
yes hawke replies in tears and then i guess there are 
not many women who would have put up with me all that time but my 
love for her never changes i have always loved hazel always will 
hawke also referred to his past drinking which his biographer 
blanche dalpuget says earned him an entry in the guinness book of 
records when he drank 2 pints of beer in 12 seconds while 3udying 
at oxford university in britain 
i was never an alcoholic in the sense that i couldnt work 
said hawke who has said he stopped drinking alcohol in 1979 i 
always worked very hard it was getting to the stage where at the 
end of the day i was looking forward too much to a drink i thought 
that was pretty unintelligent

state department officials are bracing for 
their toughest fight with congress in years over aid to el salvador 
following presidential elections won by the most rightwing 
candidate 
house democrats have told the administration they will attempt to 
impose tight conditions on aid to el salvador in hopes of pressuring 
the country to improve its human rights performance and negotiate 
peace with leftist guerrillas 
one democratic faction led by rep david obey dwis would 
release the aid in increments threatening to cut off the money at 
any time if el salvador does not meet requirements set forth in 
legislation 
a state department official insisting on anonymity called this 
approach unbelievable micromanagement on monday and said the 
administration will attempt to keep the aid program as free of 
conditions as possible 
obey chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on 
foreign operations was not available monday for comment on his 
legislative plans 
secretary of state james a baker iii was expected to be asked 
about the aid issue today during testimony before a house foreign 
affairs subcommittee 
in el salvador the arena party candidate alfredo cristiani won 
a lopsided victory over fidel chavez mena of the ruling christian 
democratic party in sundays election 
the united states has provided 35 billion in aid to el salvador 
during this decade but many lawmakers are becoming restive about 
increasing human rights violations there and governments inability 
to negotiate a settlement to the war 
adding to the concern is that the arena party has been linked to 
rightist death squads one of the most prominent leaders in the 
party is roberto daubuisson who was described by former us 
ambassador robert white as a pathological killer in 1980 the 
carter administration stripped daubuisson of his us visa 
cristiani insists hell be his own man as president and will not 
be beholden to daubuisson and his allies the success of the 
administration in obtaining approval for salvador aid without 
conditions depends on cristianis ability to disassociate himself 
from daubuisson according to government officials 
the administration contends that the farabundo marti national 
liberation guerrilla movement has refused to enter into serious 
negotiations on ending the war as for rights abuses officials 
contend that politically motivated killings are only a small 
fraction of what they were in the 198082 period 
until 1984 the reagan administration endured one clash with 
coress after another over aid to el salvador because of widespread 
rights violations it was not until the election of president jose 
napoleon duarte in 1984 that the administration was able to win 
bipartisan support on that issue 
the state department said monday it is prepared to continue 
supporting el salvador but only so long as the government respects 
democracy and protects human rights 
department spokesman charles redman praised the salvadoran people 
for having braved violence and terror which he blamed on the 
guerrillas 
at least 29 guerrillas and soldiers were killed in fighting 
sunday as well as two civilians three journalists two 
salvadorans and a dutchman also were killed by government security 
forces over the election weekend 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
judgments about human rights will be a very important factor in 
guiding us policy toward el salvador

million bail for the former diffrent strokes star despite a

high on cocaine for weeks before the shooting the bail will 
stand
